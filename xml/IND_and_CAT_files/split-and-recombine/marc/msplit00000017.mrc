RESULTS: Five MFCs were operated at sludge ages ranging from 1.4 to 10.0 days. Results showed the superb performance of the MFC operating under a sludge age of 2.5 days. Desulfuromonas, Syntrophothermus, Solitalea, Acholeplasma, Propionicimonas, Desulfobacula and Sphaerochaeta are proposed as potentially responsible for the bio‐electrogenic activity. CONCLUSIONS: Microbial population analysis through Illumina amplicon sequencing demonstrated that despite all MFCs being seeded with the same mixed culture inoculum, the biological cultures developed in the suspension and the biofilm are completely different and depend strongly on sludge age. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcholeplasma 3aDesulfobacula 3aDesulfuromonas 3aSyntrophothermus 3abiofilm 3ainoculum 3amicrobial fuel cells 3amixed culture 3amonitoring 3asludge1 aZamorano‐López, Nuria1 aBorras, Luis1 aFernandez‐Morales, Francisco Jesús1 aCañizares, Pablo1 aSeco, Aurora1 aRodrigo, Manuel0 tJournal of chemical technology and biotechnology.g2018 May, v. 93, no. 5 p.1290-1299dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl39259x0268-25757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jctb.54883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03112naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001500153245013700168500001900305520156700324592002801891650002201919650002201941650001601963650002201979650001602001650002502017650001702042650002202059650001602081650001602097650001102113650001102124650001902135650002502154650001702179651001002196653002502206653002502231653002202256653002102278653003702299700001902336700001802355700001702373773011902390856008802509852000902597655001202606IND60719955320221118072823.0210401e20210315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071995532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1439462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Yao10aOccurrence and fate of linear alkylbenzenes and their potential as environmental molecular markers in highly urbanized river systems  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aRapid industrialization, urbanization, and population growth have led to the common occurrence of black-stinking urban rivers. Assessing regional anthropogenic influences is beneficial to develop effective remediation strategies. This study comprehensively investigated the occurrence and fate of linear alkylbenzenes (LABs) as molecular markers of anthropogenic influences in three media (filtered water, suspended particulate matter (SPM), and sediment) in a highly urbanized river (Baihaimian River) in Guangzhou, South China. The concentrations of LABs ranged from 41 to 215 ng/L in the dissolved phase, from 7122 to 46,640 ng/g dry weight in the SPM phase, and from 73 to 3650 ng/g dry weight in surface sediments (0–10 cm depth). The spatial distribution of LABs was probably affected by the surrounding environment, river flux, and sediment properties. No biotransformation of LABs in water samples and a slight biotransformation in sediments were observed. Significant correlations were found between total nitrogen, ammonia nitrogen, and LABs in river water, indicating the same domestic wastewater sources. The positive correlation between total organic carbon (TOC) and LABs in sediments suggested that TOC worked as the controlling factor for the redistribution of LABs and that local sewage discharge was the dominant TOC input. The total mass inventory of LABs in sediment in Baihaimian River was 21 kg. The total mass of LABs released into Baihaimian River was 183 kg per year, among them, 63% was discharged into the adjacent Liuxi River.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium nitrogen 3abiotransformation 3aenvironment 3aindustrialization 3ainventories 3amunicipal wastewater 3aparticulates 3apopulation growth 3aremediation 3ariver water 3arivers 3asewage 3atotal nitrogen 3atotal organic carbon 3aurbanization 3aChina 0aLinear alkylbenzenes 0aBlack-stinking river 0aMolecular markers 0aSewage pollution 0aHydrophobic organic contaminants1 aLiu, Liangying1 aLiu, Guoqiang1 aGong, Yanyan0 tScience of the total environment.g2021 Mar. 15, v. 760 p.143946-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1439463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02182naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006100139245005700200300001600257500001400273500002000287520101400307592002801321596004701349650001701396650001801413650001601431650001601447650001801463650001501481700005401496700006401550773013601614856007301750852000901823655001201832IND60710602120221120035422.0200912e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071060212DNAL7 a10.1111/ahe.125182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDu Cheyne, Charis1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8675-805214aThe complex TIE between macrophages and angiogenesis  ap. 585-596.  aNAL-light  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aMacrophages are primarily known as phagocytic immune cells, but they also play a role in diverse processes, such as morphogenesis, homeostasis and regeneration. In this review, we discuss the influence of macrophages on angiogenesis, the process of new blood vessel formation from the pre‐existing vasculature. Macrophages play crucial roles at each step of the angiogenic cascade, starting from new blood vessel sprouting to the remodelling of the vascular plexus and vessel maturation. Macrophages form promising targets for both pro‐ and anti‐angiogenic treatments. However, to target macrophages, we will first need to understand the mechanisms that control the functional plasticity of macrophages during each of the steps of the angiogenic cascade. Here, we review recent insights in this topic. Special attention will be given to the TIE2‐expressing macrophage (TEM), which is a subtype of highly angiogenic macrophages that is able to influence angiogenesis via the angiopoietin–TIE pathway.  aPublisher supplied data  a1S22818NcFonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek 3aangiogenesis 3ablood vessels 3ahomeostasis 3amacrophages 3amorphogenesis 3aplasticity1 aTay, Hanna1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6354-46921 aDe Spiegelaere, Ward1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2097-84390 tAnatomia, histologia, embryologia.g2020 Sept., v. 49, no. 5 p.585-596dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3895878x0340-20967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ahe.125183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03863naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245016400172300001400336520198100350592002802331650001202359650001402371650001102385650001502396650001102411650001202422650000902434650001902443650001502462650000802477650002202485650001202507650001502519650001202534650001402546650002502560650001302585650001902598650000902617650001302626650002502639650002402664650002202688650001102710650001602721651001802737651001702755653001902772653001202791653001202803653001402815653001802829653001202847653001702859653001702876700002302893700002502916700002002941700001902961773010302980856008503083852000903168655001203177IND60634342620221119231209.0190530e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063434262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pocean.2019.02.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDezutter, Thibaud10aMismatch between microalgae and herbivorous copepods due to the record sea ice minimum extent of 2012 and the late sea ice break-up of 2013 in the Beaufort Sea  ap. 66-77.  aThe unprecedented pace of warming of the Arctic Ocean affects a wide range of pelagic processes, from primary production to fish recruitment. Sequential sediment traps deployed on oceanographic moorings at the Beaufort Sea shelf break were used to investigate the impact of variations in physical conditions on the phenology of microalgae and herbivorous copepods. Water temperature, salinity, microalgal fluxes, and zooplankton fluxes were monitored over 6 of the 7 annual cycles from September 2009 to September 2016 with a hiatus from September 2013 to August 2014. Satellite-derived sea ice concentration and snow depth were retrieved for the same period. For 5 of the 6 cycles, a consistent interval between the vernal abundance of the Calanus species (C. glacialis and C. hyperboreus), the export of the ice alga Nitzschia frigida, and peak in nauplii abundance and diatom export, reflected a match between microalgae and herbivorous copepods. Drastic changes in water temperatures and ice conditions during the 2012–2013 cycle affected this synchronization. In 2012, the record sea ice minimum extent led to anomalously high upper water temperatures during autumn and winter that led to a shoaling of the vertical distribution of C. hyperboreus females and to the production of their nauplii at shallower depths several weeks before diatom export. Due to several oceanic and atmospheric forcing, the record sea ice minimum extent was followed in 2013 by a rebound in ice cover that delayed snowmelt, sea ice melt, and ice algae export. This delay resulted in a mismatch between C. glacialis females and N. frigida fluxes and in fewer C. glacialis nauplii in June and July 2013. These mismatch events likely had a negative impact on Calanus recruitment and on the subsequent transfer of energy to carnivorous zooplankton and fish. It is crucial to maintain mooring deployments to accurately assess the wide range of effects of climate warming on the marine ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCalanus 3aNitzschia 3aautumn 3acarnivores 3aenergy 3afemales 3afish 3aglobal warming 3aherbivores 3aice 3amarine ecosystems 3amelting 3amicroalgae 3anauplii 3aphenology 3aprimary productivity 3asalinity 3asediment traps 3asnow 3asnowmelt 3aspatial distribution 3aspecies recruitment 3awater temperature 3awinter 3azooplankton 3aArctic region 3aBeaufort Sea 0aMatch-mismatch 0aCopepod 0aDiatoms 0aIce algae 0aSediment trap 0aMooring 0aBeaufort Sea 0aArctic Ocean1 aLalande, Catherine1 aDufresne, Christiane1 aDarnis, Gérald1 aFortier, Louis0 tProgress in oceanography.g2019 Apr., v. 173 p.66-77dElsevier LtdwJournal:11761x0079-66117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pocean.2019.02.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03149naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100003100153245009400184300001600278520176300294592002802057650000802085650001802093650001602111650001902127650002302146650002002169650001402189650001702203650002502220650002102245650001502266650001602281650000902297650001002306651001102316653003102327653001602358653001602374700002802390700002402418700003502442773010602477856008702583852000902670655001202679IND60545521820221117173933.0160902e20140401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054552182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2013.11.1292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKonstantopoulou, Sophia S.10aIndoor air quality in a bar/restaurant before and after the smoking ban in Athens, Greece  ap. 136-143.  aIn this study we compared indoor air pollutant concentrations in a bar/restaurant in Greece before and after the enactment of a smoking ban legislation of 2008. This was done to investigate whether the separation of the venue into smoking and non-smoking areas will have an impact on workers and customers from secondhand smoke (SHS) exposure (null hypothesis). The study was completed within an 8-month period beginning in March 2010 and ending on November 2010. We compared the average of the measured PM0.1 concentrations in the smoking zones between the pre-ban and post-ban periods. Overall reduction in the number of particles was 18% between pre-ban and post-ban periods. The mean of the 36 total CO2 measurements for the pre- and the post-ban period was 611ppm. We calculated the ventilation rates per occupant (Vo in l/s/occ) and found it to be higher in the post-ban period (19.4l/s/occ), thus complying with the ASHARAE standard for Vo of 15l/s/occ at maximum occupancy, than in the pre-ban period (10.7l/s/occ). The mean of the 36 total CO measurements for the pre-ban period was 2ppm. CO measurements in the post-ban period were less than the detection limit of 1ppm. Emissions of nitrogen dioxide and formaldehyde weren't detected in any of the zones. It was observed there was about 50% distribution of pollutants from the smoking zones to the smoke-free zones. The smoking ban effect on the occupancy levels was initially reduced by 16%, but based on other similar studies this transition period will be followed by an increase in the occupancy.Passive smoking and associated risks were significantly reduced but not totally eliminated, indicating the need for stronger enforcement or complete partition between smoking and non-smoking areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aair pollution 3aair quality 3acarbon dioxide 3aconsumers (people) 3adetection limit 3aemissions 3aformaldehyde 3alaws and regulations 3anitrogen dioxide 3apollutants 3arestaurants 3arisk 3asmoke 3aGreece 0aSecond hand smoke exposure 0aSmoking ban 0aAir quality1 aBehrakis, Panagiotis K.1 aLazaris, Andreas C.1 aNicolopoulou-Stamati, Polyxeni0 tScience of the total environment.g2014 Apr. 01, v. 476-477 p.136-143dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2013.11.1293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03361naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100006200142245007300204300001800277500002000295520166500315592002801980596004902008596008002057596003802137650001202175650001202187650001102199650001502210650001802225650002102243650001102264650001402275650000902289650001302298650001102311650002402322650002202346651001202368700005502380700001902435700001802454700005902472700002102531700001902552700006002571773012602631856007702757852000902834655001202843IND60788041820221118114249.0220811e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078804182DNAL7 a10.1029/2017WR0222412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOmidvar, Hamidreza1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8124-726410aRapid Modification of Urban Land Surface Temperature During Rainfall  ap. 4245-4264.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThis paper examines runoff dynamics and heat transfer during rainfall over urban surfaces, in particular pavements. A kinematic wave approach is combined with heat storage and transfer schemes to develop a model for pervious and impervious pavements. The resulting framework is a numerical prognostic model that can simulate the temperature fields in the subsurface and runoff layers to capture the rapid cooling of the surface, as well as the thermal pollution advected in the runoff. Extensive field measurements are conducted over several types of experimental pavements in Arizona to probe the physics and then to validate the model. The experimental data and the model results are in good agreement, and their joint analysis elucidates the physics of the rapid heat transfer from the subsurface to the runoff. A demonstrative application of the model over a (hypothetical) parking lot, with impervious or pervious asphalt, is then presented. It illustrates that the rate of ground surface temperature cooling for the impervious pavement is lower than the pervious one (where infiltration is very effective at removing heat). Finally, the analysis of the energy budgets unravels the relative importance of the various physical mechanisms in transferring heat from the subsurface to the runoff and the atmosphere. This transfer is dominated by terms associated with water flux and subsurface heat extraction, while latent, sensible, and radiative heat fluxes are minor contributors. The findings underline the importance of including rainfall‐induced cooling in geophysical models that seek to study urban heat islands or urban precipitation modification.  aPublisher supplied data  aW911NF‐15‐1‐0003cArmy Research Office  a1444758cU.S. National Science Foundation's Sustainability Research Network  cPrinceton Environmental Institute 3abitumen 3acooling 3aenergy 3ageophysics 3aheat transfer 3amodel validation 3amodels 3apavements 3arain 3aresearch 3arunoff 3asurface temperature 3athermal pollution 3aArizona1 aSong, Jiyun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9483-05011 aYang, Jiachuan1 aArwatz, Gilad1 aWang, Zhi‐Hua1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9155-86051 aHultmark, Marcus1 aKaloush, Kamil1 aBou‐Zeid, Elie1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6137-81090 tWater resources research.g2018 July, v. 54, no. 7 p.4245-4264dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl46306x0043-13977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2017WR0222413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02863naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005600148245018100204300002000385500001900405520151200424592002801936596006501964596006502029650001302094650002102107650001402128650001402142650001302156700001602169700001902185700001502204700001702219700001202236700001202248773012502260856008302385852000902468655001202477IND60700450920221121202235.0200702e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070045092DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-020-04962-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Yanjun1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6175-781410aInsights into the elevated electrochemical performance and kinetic characteristics of magnesium-substituted Na3V2−xMgx(PO4)3/C with superior rate capability and long lifespan  ap. 13141-13156.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aNa₃V₂(PO₄)₃ has been pursued to be a prospective cathode for SIBs because of its outstanding structural stability. Nevertheless, the extensive application of Na₃V₂(PO₄)₃ is impeded by its poor electronic conductivity and inferior Na⁺ migration ability. Herein, a promising Mg-doped Na₃V₂₋ₓMgₓ(PO₄)₃/C composite is prepared by a facile carbon-thermal reduction route. The substitution of magnesium onto vanadium site downsizes the particle, providing shorter pathway for the migration of Na⁺ and electron. The introduction of Mg²⁺ generates beneficial holes to facilitate the electronic diffusion efficiently. A superior electrochemical performance of Na₃V₁.₉₃Mg₀.₀₇(PO₄)₃/C sample can be achieved due to the multiple synergetic effects. It delivers a high specific capacity of 113.5 mAh g⁻¹ at 0.1 C. A high reversible capacity of 95 mAh g⁻¹ can be obtained at 10 C rate, and the retention is 84.6% after 1000 cycles. Moreover, a comprehensive GITT analysis is conducted to give a better understanding of the elevated electrochemical properties for Na₃V₁.₉₃Mg₀.₀₇(PO₄)₃/C: The migration of Na⁺ suffers from the intense interactions arising from the phase transfer during the potential plateau (~ 3.4 V). The minimum values of DNₐ₊ at ~ 3.4 V for Na₃V₁.₉₃Mg₀.₀₇(PO₄)₃/C are one order magnitude higher than that of undoped sample, implying the improved kinetics from magnesium substitution.  aPublisher supplied data  a201901D211217cNatural Science Foundation of Shanxi Province  a201801D121284cNatural Science Foundation of Shanxi Province 3acathodes 3aelectrochemistry 3alongevity 3amagnesium 3avanadium1 aZheng, Run,1 aWang, Yanzhong1 aWang, Chao1 aHe, Zhenfeng1 aLi, Dan1 aGuo, Li0 tJournal of materials science.g2020 Sept., v. 55, no. 27 p.13141-13156dSpringer USwJournal:jnl4392857x0022-24617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-020-04962-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02581naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245006200165300001400227520102000241592002801261650002101289650001501310650001601325650001401341650001001355650002201365650001301387650001401400650001201414650001301426650001401439650004801453653000701501653001301508653001001521653000901531653000801540653001101548653003001559653001301589653004301602653002801645653003601673653004101709700002501750700001701775700001801792700002001810700002201830773007201852856008201924852000902006655001202015IND60552444320221118025410.0161021e20150210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055244432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gene.2014.11.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, Ashok10aHuntington's disease: An update of therapeutic strategies  ap. 91-97.  aHuntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant triplet repeat genetic disease, which results in progressive neuronal degeneration in the neostriatum and neocortex, and associated functional impairments in motor, cognitive, and psychiatric domains. Although the genetic mutation caused by abnormal CAG expansion within the htt gene on chromosome 4p16.3 is identified, the mechanism by which this leads to neuronal cell death and the question of why striatal neurones are targeted both remain unknown. Patients manifest a typical phenotype of sporadic, rapid, involuntary control of limb movement, stiffness of limbs, impaired cognition and severe psychiatric disturbances. There have been a number of therapeutic advances in the treatment of HD, such as fetal neural transplantation, RNA interference (RNAi) and transglutaminase inhibitors (Tgasei). Although there is intensive research into HD and recent findings seem promising, effective therapeutic strategies may not be developed until the next few decades.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA interference 3acell death 3achromosomes 3acognition 3agenes 3agenetic disorders 3amutation 3aneocortex 3aneurons 3apatients 3aphenotype 3aprotein-glutamine gamma-glutamyltransferase 0aHD 0ahtt gene 0aHDACi 0aRNAi 0aASO 0aTgasei 0aHuntington's disease (HD) 0ahtt gene 0aHistone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) 0aRNA interference (RNAi) 0aAntisense oligonucleotide (ASO) 0aTransglutaminase inhibitors (Tgasei)1 aKumar Singh, Sandeep1 aKumar, Vijay1 aKumar, Dinesh1 aAgarwal, Sarita1 aRana, Manoj Kumar0 tGene.g2015 Feb. 10, v. 556 p.91-97dElsevier B.V.x0378-11197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2014.11.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02796naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245011200164300002000276500001900296520153200315592002801847596005901875596006501934650001501999650001702014650002502031650001402056650001902070700001402089700001602103700001502119700005602134700001502190773012502205856008302330852000902413655001202422IND60700451020221121172936.0200702e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070045102DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-020-04958-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Minmin10aFinely modulating the morphology and composition of CuxNi1−x for enhanced microwave absorption capability  ap. 12953-12968.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSome inevitable disadvantages (being thick and heavy with narrow broadband) restrict the application of Cu-based absorbers in microwave absorption field, which can be overcome by finely modulating the morphology and component of 1D structures. Here, we reported ethylenediamine-steered in situ two-step reduction reactions, which allowed the tunable preparation of CuₓNi₁₋ₓ (x = 0, 0.005, 0.02, 0.0344, 0.0934, 0.1581, 0.2243, and 1) composites with continuously tunable components and morphology varying from smooth rods to urchin-like rods and microspheres. The recombination of Ni with Cu into CuₓNi₁₋ₓ composites can tune crystallite size, inner stress, lattice constant, component, shape as well as properties. The CuₓNi₁₋ₓ (x = 0.0344–0.1581) composites exhibited stronger and wider absorption band under a lower filling mass fraction and thinner sample than other Cu-based absorbers. Due to the combined action of double dielectric relaxation, double magnetic resonances, high attenuation, and good impedance match. The optimal microwave absorption capability (MACs) was achieved for Cu₀.₀₃₄₄Ni₀.₉₆₅₆ microspheres with a maximum RL value of − 67.5 dB at 14.74 GHz and a broad frequency band (99% attenuation) of 15.41 GHz, corresponding to 1.7–10 mm sample thickness. Owing to tunable saturation magnetization and excellent MACs, the CuₓNi₁₋ₓ composites can work as a kind of promising absorber for applications in electronic equipment and devices.  aPublisher supplied data  a51672252cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aLY14B010001cNatural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province 3aabsorption 3acrystallites 3aelectronic equipment 3amagnetism 3amicroparticles1 aChen, Yue1 aWei, Haiyan1 aKe, Lifeng1 aTong, Guoxiu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8772-12511 aWu, Wenhua0 tJournal of materials science.g2020 Sept., v. 55, no. 27 p.12953-12968dSpringer USwJournal:jnl4392857x0022-24617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-020-04958-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03791naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245017000162300001800332520180900350592002802159596007902187596007902266596006302345650000802408650001802416650001602434650000902450650001302459650001002472650001302482650001602495650001902511650001702530650001102547650001402558650002502572650001102597650002202608650002002630650001602650650001402666700001402680700001802694700001602712700002002728700001902748700001802767700001302785700001602798700001702814700001502831700002002846700001402866700005402880773013902934856008303073852000903156655001203165IND60710602520221120035221.0211021e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071060252DNAL7 a10.1007/s00122-020-03632-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZeng, Wei10aIdentification of a genomic region controlling thermotolerance at flowering in maize using a combination of whole genomic re-sequencing and bulked segregant analysis  ap. 2797-2810.  aKEY MESSAGE : A novel genomic region controlling thermotolerance at flowering was identified by the combination of whole genomic re-sequencing and bulked segregant analysis in maize. The increasing frequency of extreme high temperature has brought a great threat to the development of maize throughout its life cycle, especially during the flowering phase. However, the genetic basis of thermotolerance at flowering in maize remains poorly understood. Here, we characterized a thermotolerant maize ecotype Abe2 and dissected its genetic basis using a F₂:₈ recombinant inbred line (RIL) population generated from a cross between Abe2 and B73. After continuous high temperature stress above 35 °C for 17 days, Abe2 and B73 show distinct leaf scorching phenotype under field conditions. To identify the genomic regions associated with the phenotypic variation, we applied a combination of whole genomic re-sequencing and bulked segregant analysis, and revealed 10,316,744 SNPs and 1,488,302 InDels between the two parental lines, and 2,693,054 SNPs and 313,757 InDels between the two DNA pools generated from the thermos-tolerant and the sensitive individuals of the RIL, of which, 108,655 and 17,853 SNPs may cause nonsynonymous variations. Finally, a 7.41 Mb genomic region on chromosome 1 was identified, and 7 candidate genes were annotated to participate in high temperature-related stress response. A candidate gene Zm00001d033339 encoding a serine/threonine protein kinase was proposed to be the most likely causative gene contributing to the thermotolerance at flowering by involving in stomatal movement (GO: 0010119) via Abscisic acid (ABA) pathway (KO04075). This work could provide an opportunity for gene cloning and pyramiding breeding to improve thermotolerance at flowering in maize.  aPublisher supplied data  a2016YFD0101803cThe National Key Research and Development Program of China  a2017YFD0301301cthe National Key Research and Development Program of China  a31670264cthe National Natural Science Foundation of China 3aDNA 3aabscisic acid 3achromosomes 3acorn 3aecotypes 3agenes 3agenomics 3aheat stress 3aheat tolerance 3ainbred lines 3aleaves 3aphenotype 3aphenotypic variation 3aserine 3astomatal movement 3astress response 3atemperature 3athreonine1 aShi, Jian1 aQiu, Chunhong1 aWang, Yunhe1 aRehman, Shamsur1 aYu, Shuaishuai1 aHuang, Shijie1 aHe, Chen1 aWang, Wanyi1 aChen, Hongyi1 aChen, Chen1 aWang, Chuanhong1 aTao, Zhen1 aLi, Peijin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1579-75530 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g2020 Oct., v. 133, no. 10 p.2797-2810dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl2874x0040-57527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00122-020-03632-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02723naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245011000171300001800281520173500299592002802034650001202062650001702074650001002091650001602101650001002117651001602127651001102143700002502154700001902179700001502198773008202213856008102295852000902376655001202385IND50069242720221121151256.0150208e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006924272DNAL7 a10.1007/s00468-013-0887-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDüthorn, Elisabeth10aInfluence of micro-site conditions on tree-ring climate signals and trends in central and northern Sweden  ap. 1395-1404.  aTree-ring chronologies are important indicators of pre-instrumental, natural climate variability. Some of the longest chronologies are from northern Fennoscandia, where ring width measurement series from living trees are combined with series from sub-fossil trees, preserved in shallow lakes, to form millennial-length records. We here assess the recent ends of such timeseries by comparing climate signals and growth characteristics in central and northern Sweden, of (1) trees growing at lakeshore micro-sites (representing the source of sub-fossil material of supra-long chronologies), with (2) trees collected in dryer micro-sites several meters “inland”. Calibration trials reveal a predominating June–September temperature signal in N-Sweden and a weaker but significant May–September precipitation signal in C-Sweden. At the micro-site level, the temperature signal in N-Sweden is stronger in the lakeshore trees compared to the inland trees, whereas the precipitation signal in C-Sweden remains unchanged among the lakeshore and inland trees. Tree-rings at cambial ages >40 years are also substantially wider in the lakeshore micro-site in C-Sweden, and juvenile rings are more variable (and wider) in the dryer micro-site in N-Sweden (compared to the adjacent micro-sites). By combining the data of the various micro-sites with relict samples spanning the past 1,000 years, we demonstrate that growth rate differences at the micro-site scale can affect the low frequency trends of millennial-length chronologies. For the supra-long chronologies from northern Fennoscandia, that are derived from sub-fossil lake material, it is recommended to combine these data with measurement series from only lakeshore trees.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3agrowth rings 3alakes 3atemperature 3atrees 3aScandinavia 3aSweden1 aHolzkämper, Steffen1 aTimonen, Mauri1 aEsper, Jan0 tTrees.g2013 Oct., v. 27, no. 5 p.1395-1404dSpringer-Verlagx0931-18907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00468-013-0887-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03287naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001400153245014100167300001600308520213000324592002802454650001502482650001502497650001902512650002302531650001802554650001702572650001702589650001402606700001802620700002602638700001602664700001402680700001902694773010202713856008902815852000902904655001202913IND60561580020221118003430.0170119e20170119xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056158002DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.6b021082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYuan, Bin10aPermeability Reduction of Berea Cores Owing to Nanoparticle Adsorption onto the Pore Surface: Mechanistic Modeling and Experimental Work  ap. 795-804.  aThis paper examines an integrated approach to study the permeability alteration resulting from nanofluid flow through porous media. Hydrophilic nanostructure particles (NSPs) are dispersed in the brine stream at 0.05, 0.2, and 0.5 wt % concentrations and injected into several oil-wet Berea sandstones. The pressure drops across the cores and the effluent nanoparticle concentrations are monitored. To quantify the nanoparticle adsorption/detachment and straining behavior and associated effects on formation permeability, analytical mechanistic models are derived using the method of characteristics. The interplay between nanoparticles and rocks is described by the classical particle filtration theory coupled with the maximum adsorption concentration model. All of the necessary parameters, e.g., the maximum adsorption concentrations, reversible or detachment adsorption concentrations, nanoparticle adsorption and straining rates, and corresponding formation damage coefficients, are characterized. The experimental results indicate that nanoparticle adsorption and straining (i.e., the maximum adsorption concentration and nanoparticle adsorption straining rates) are enhanced along with the increase of the nanoparticle injection concentration. As a result, the breakthrough of injected nanoparticles is delayed, the steady-state effluent concentration decreases, and the pressure drop increases more rapidly. The nanoparticle adsorption consists of reversible and irreversible adsorption. During post-flush, the reversible nanoparticle concentrations are enhanced by the increase of nanoparticle concentrations. In practice, this paper contributes to the following applications: (1) Lab experiments are applied to highlight the effects of nanoparticle adsorption, straining, and detachment behaviors on the formation damage. (2) The analytical mechanistic model provides physical insights to quantify nanofluid flow performance and can be extended to optimize the treatment of nanofluid application (e.g., injection concentrations) while considering both the loss of nanoparticles and their induced formation damage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3afiltration 3ahydrophilicity 3amechanistic models 3ananoparticles 3apermeability 3aporous media 3asandstone1 aWang, Wendong1 aMoghanloo, Rouzbeh G.1 aSu, Yuliang1 aWang, Kai1 aJiang, Miaolun0 tEnergy & Fuels.g2017 Jan. 19, v. 31, no. 1 p.795-804dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.energyfuels.6b021083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03239naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245009900173500002200272520196500294592002802259650001802287650001302305650002602318650001002344650002202354650001402376650001502390653001802405653001302423653002602436653001302462653001202475653001402487653001302501700006702514700002102581700002902602773009202631856008502723852000902808655001202817IND60634342820221119231241.0190326e20190225xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063434282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pocean.2019.02.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchmidt, Christina10aNew insights from the deep: Meiofauna in the Kuril-Kamchatka Trench and adjacent abyssal plain  aPre-press version  aCommunity and abundance patterns of meiofauna and Harpacticoida in the Kuril-Kamchatka Trench, that’s trench slope and adjacent abyssal plain lay in the North-Western Pacific were investigated in relation to environmental variables. Overall, Nematoda was the dominant taxon of the meiofauna community (93%), followed by Copepoda (3%). Nineteen harpacticoid families and 1 subfamily were found, whereby the family Ameiridae was most abundant in the study area. Within eight selected (sub)families (Argestidae, Aegisthidae, Ancorabolidae, Canthocamptidae, Cletodidae, Cylindropsyllinae, Parameiropsidae, Zosimeidae) 27 genera were found, with Zosime and Mesocletodes being most abundant. Dispersion effects characterized the meiofauna community abundances, while the Harpacticoida communities in the hadal and abyssal areas of the slope were distinct. The main dissimilarities observed in the two sites were abundances of Nematoda, Ameiridae, Zosime and Mesocletodes. Food availability, sediment composition and water depth are environmental drivers structuring the investigated communities in the abyssal and hadal. For the trench slope, no correlations with the investigated environmental variables were found. Very likely variables other than the investigated ones act as environmental drivers for the trench slope (e.g. topography). Furthermore, a tendency of meiofauna to increase in total abundances was detected with increasing depth in the deeper stations starting at 6000 m. In contrast, total Harpacticoida abundances decrease with depth. Considering the abundance of Harpacticoida families and genera individually, the abundance of some taxa decreased in the trench slope but increased in the hadal (Zosimeidae, Miraciidae, Argestidae, Parameiropsis, Zosime). Diversity indices based on Harpacticoida genus and family level were not distinguishable with the exception of equitability (J) at the genus level (abyssal vs hadal; trench slope vs hadal).  aPublisher supplied data 3aHarpacticoida 3aNematoda 3aenvironmental factors 3afauna 3afood availability 3asediments 3atopography 0aHarpacticoida 0aCopepoda 0aNorth-Western Pacific 0aDeep Sea 0aBenthos 0aAbundance 0aKuramBio1 aSattarova, Valentina V.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4716-78901 aKatrynski, Laura1 aMartínez Arbizu, Pedro,0 tProgress in oceanography.g2019 Feb. 25, dElsevier LtdwJournal:11761x0079-66117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pocean.2019.02.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02789naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003200147245022200179300001600401520100000417592002801417650001101445650002201456650002201478650002201500650001801522650002101540650003201561650001201593650001801605650004301623651001101666653000801677653001001685653002201695653000901717653000901726653000901735653001301744653000801757653000901765653000801774653000801782653002201790653001901812653003601831653001701867653001901884700001901903700003101922700005501953773011202008856008202120852000902202655001202211IND60612316320221121184110.0190415e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061231632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jff.2018.04.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Cássia Lemos Lima, Rita10aBrazilian insulin plant as a bifunctional food: Dual high-resolution PTP1B and α-glucosidase inhibition profiling combined with HPLC-HRMS-SPE-NMR for identification of antidiabetic compounds in Myrcia rubella Cambess  ap. 444-451.  aSix species of Myrcia, commonly known as 'insulin plants' in Brazil, were assessed for their potential as functional foods. Thus, dual high-resolution α-glucosidase/PTP1B inhibition profiling and HPLC-HRMS-SPE-NMR analysis were used to identify the antidiabetic constituents of the crude ethyl acetate extract of M. rubella Cambess. A total of 31 compounds were identified, including seven α-glucosidase inhibitors with IC50 values between 0.6 and 22.4 μM: 4,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid, isoquercitrin, quercetin-3-O-β-d-glucuronide, kaempferol-3-O-(6″-galloyl)-β-d-glucopyranoside, quercetin-3-O-(6″-malonyl)-glucopyranoside, quercetin-3-O-(6″-(E)-feruloyl)-β-d-glucopyranoside, and quercetin-3-O-(2″-(E)-sinapoyl)-glucopyranoside as well as three strong PTP1B inhibitors with IC50 values between 0.4 and 3.1 μM: kaempferol-3-O-α-l-rhamnoside, astragalin, and arjunolic acid.

The risks of violence and damage, or significant delays and cancellations in infrastructure development, are rife in these states. Thus, least-cost planning processes must explicitly address the inherent risks. While there are numerous statistical methods for dealing with decision making under uncertainty, few of them have been applied to power system planning and tailored for these situations. We present a general theoretical framing of the issue and illustrate application of a very simple method to a case study of the Republic of South Sudan. We find that, in general, the resilience aspects, combined with modular and incremental benefits of distributed generation technologies and systems, emerge as attractive options if the various risks of infrastructure development are included in modelling techniques.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3adecision making 3aenergy 3ainfrastructure 3amodels 3aplanning 3arisk 3astatistical analysis 3auncertainty 3aviolence 3aSudan 0aC6 0aO2 0aQ4 0aFragile and conflict states 0aEnergy planning 0aPower systems1 aCaṭṭopādhyāẏa, Debabrata,0 tEnergy for sustainable development.g2016 June, v. 32 p.110-120dElsevier Inc.aInternational Energy InitiativewJournal:12424x0973-08267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.esd.2016.02.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02601naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005400148245011200202300002000314500001900334520132900353592002801682596005901710596005901769650001101828650001301839650001301852650001501865650002101880650001901901650003801920700001701958700001801975700001701993773012502010856008302135852000902218655001202227IND60700451120221121172927.0200702e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070045112DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-020-04939-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Xiao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7675-851812aA novel fabrication technique of toughened TiC-based solid solution cermets using mechanochemical synthesis  ap. 12776-12788.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aCeramic–metal composite powders (Ti,M)C-Ni (M = Mo, W and Ta) were prepared from elemental powders using a one-step mechanochemical synthesis method through high-energy ball milling. The microstructure and mechanical properties of the resulting cermets were also investigated. The analytical results revealed that ball milling of Ti-M-C-Ni elemental powders triggered a combustion reaction between Ti and C. The reaction resembled a fast sintering process which facilitated alloy elements atoms dissolve into the newly formed TiC, synthesizing the (Ti,M)C-Ni composite powders. The microstructure of the sintered (Ti,M)C-Ni cermets consisted of the core-rim structure grains and homogenous grains. High-resolution transmission electron microscope analysis results revealed that there was a misorientation between the ceramic phase and the binder phase in the cermets, but the interface between the core and the rim was coherent. The cermets exhibited mechanical properties that were comparable to conventionally produced cermets, particularly in fracture toughness which was as high as 12.45 MPa m¹/². The excellent cohesion between the Ni binder and the (Ti,M)C solid solution and the reduction in the interfacial stress in ceramic grains were believed to be responsible for the enhanced toughening of the cermets.  aPublisher supplied data  a51905194cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2017M612447cPostdoctoral Research Foundation of China 3aalloys 3aceramics 3acohesion 3acombustion 3amechanochemistry 3amicrostructure 3atransmission electron microscopes1 aYao, Zhenhua1 aXiong, Weihao1 aXu, Jianfeng0 tJournal of materials science.g2020 Sept., v. 55, no. 27 p.12776-12788dSpringer USwJournal:jnl4392857x0022-24617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-020-04939-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01491naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094024002200128024001900150040001800169100002400187245009700211300001800308506007600326520023700402592002800639506003700667650002700704650003500731650001600766650001100782650002500793650002100818700002000839700002000859700002200879773012700901856008001028852000901108655001201117IND60117655020221207101836.0141126e20130627xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011765502DNAL7 a10.1128/genomeA.00384-132doi7 aPMC37075992pmcid7 a237885502pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrüning, Björn A.10aDraft Genome Sequence of Streptomyces viridochromogenes Strain Tü57, Producer of Avilamycin  ap. e00384-13.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aHere we present the draft genome sequence of Streptomyces viridochromogenes Tü57.

Photocatalysis has shown much promise in the disinfection of water/wastewater, because photocatalysis does not produce toxic by-products, and is driven by green solar energy. There are however several drawbacks that are curbing the prevalence of photocatalytic disinfection applications: one, the efficiency of photocatalysts may limit popular utilization; two, the water characteristics may present some challenges to the process. TiO₂-based photocatalysts may be readily improved if composited with noble metals or carbon nanomaterials. Noble metals give TiO₂-based composites a higher affinity for dissolved oxygen, and induce plasmonic and Schottky effects in the TiO₂; carbon nanomaterials with a tunable structure, on the other hand, give the composites an improved charge carrier separation performance. Other than photocatalyst materials, the characteristics of water/wastewater is another crucial factor in the photocatalysis process. Also examined in this review are the crucial impacts that water characteristics have on photocatalysts and their interaction with bacteria. Accordingly, strategies to address the challenge of water characteristics on photocatalytic disinfection are explored: one, to modify the semiconductor conduction band to generate long-lifetime reactive species; two, to improve the interaction between bacteria and photocatalysts.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3adisinfection 3adissolved oxygen 3aenvironment 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3asemiconductors 3asolar energy 3atoxicity 3awastewater 0aCarbon nanomaterial 0aNoble metal 0aPhotocatalytic disinfection 0aStrategic solution 0aTiO2 0aWater characteristic1 aKumar, Ashutosh1 aKhan, Musharib1 aLo, Irene M.C.0 tScience of the total environment.g2021 Mar. 01, v. 758 p.143953-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1439533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01719naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094024002200128024001900150040001800169100002200187245015400209300001800363506007600381520031200457592002800769506003700797650002600834650002700860650001100887650001100898650002500909650001400934651001100948700002300959700001800982700002101000700001701021700002301038700002001061773012701081856008001208852000901288655001201297IND60117655120221207101842.0141126e20130627xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011765512DNAL7 a10.1128/genomeA.00387-132doi7 aPMC36954262pmcid7 a238140302pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcDonald, Ryan R.10aDraft Genome Sequence of Streptococcus pyogenes Strain 06BA18369, a Human Pathogen Associated with Skin and Soft Tissue Infections in Northern Canada  ap. e00387-13.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWe report the draft sequence of Streptococcus pyogenes 06BA18369 (emm type 41.2, sequence type 579 [ST579]), isolated from a skin and soft tissue infection (SSTI) mixed with Staphylococcus aureus.

At 5 mg/mL, Cgh from L. mutabilis inhibited dipeptidyl peptidase IV activity (DPP-IV) (100%), and increased (p < 0.05) 6.5-fold the glucose uptake in a dual-layered enterocyte/adipocyte culture system compared to untreated cells, through an enhancement of glucose transporter type-4 translocation. In this model, insulin-induced glucose uptake was potentiated by addition of L. mutabilis hydrolysates. Also, Cgh L. mutabilis hydrolysates decreased (p < 0.05) by 50% gluconeogenesis in a dual-layered enterocyte/hepatocyte system and reduced phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase expression. These data showed that L. mutabilis hydrolysates can affect glucose metabolism inhibiting DPP-IV enzymatic activity, improving insulin receptor sensitivity and inhibiting hepatic gluconeogenesis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLupinus mutabilis 3aadipocytes 3adipeptidyl-peptidase IV 3aenzyme activity 3agluconeogenesis 3aglucose 3aglucose transporters 3ahydrolysates 3ahydrolysis 3ainsulin receptors 3alegumes 3amechanism of action 3amodels 3apeptides 3aAndes region 0aCg 0aCgh 0aSCgh 0aSGDh 0aGamma-conglutin 0aLupinus mutabilis Sweet 0aDiabetes 0aGlucose uptake 0aGlucose production1 aLuna-Vital, Diego A.1 aFornasini, Marco1 aBaldeón, Manuel E.1 aGonzalez de Mejia, Elvira0 tJournal of functional foods.g2018 June, v. 45 p.339-347dElsevier LtdwJournal:J000000142x1756-46467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jff.2018.04.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03845naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002300153245018500176300001400361520199700375592002802372650002202400650002102422650001902443650001502462650001002477650001102487650002902498650002502527650001702552650001902569650002902588650001302617650002602630650001302656650001902669650001402688650002402702650001702726650002702743650002402770650001002794650001502804650001702819651001002836653000802846653001502854653001002869653001402879653001302893700006002906700006002966700001703026773010403043856008703147852000903234655001203243IND60545522120221117174002.0160902e20140301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054552212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2013.11.1332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGirgenti, Vincenzo10aFrom “farm to fork” strawberry system: Current realities and potential innovative scenarios from life cycle assessment of non-renewable energy use and green house gas emissions  ap. 48-53.  aIn this study, we analysed the environmental profile of the strawberry industry in Northern Italy. The analysis was conducted using two scenarios as reference systems: strawberry crops grown in unheated plastic tunnels using currently existing cultivation techniques, post-harvest management practices and consumption patterns (scenario 1) and the same strawberry cultivation chain in which some of the materials used were replaced with bio-based materials (scenario 2). In numerous studies, biodegradable polymers have been shown to be environmentally friendly, thus potentially reducing environmental impacts. These materials can be recycled into carbon dioxide and water through composting. Many materials, such as Mater-BI® and PLA®, are also derived from renewable resources. The methodology chosen for the environmental analysis was a life cycle assessment (LCA) based on a consequential approach developed to assess a product's overall environmental impact from the production system to its usage and disposal. In the field stage, a traditional mulching film (non-biodegradable) could be replaced with a biodegradable product. This change would result in waste production of 0kg/ha for the bio-based product compared to 260kg/ha of waste for polyethylene (PE). In the post-harvest stage, the issue addressed was the use and disposal of packaging materials. The innovative scenario evaluated herein pertains to the use of new packaging materials that increase the shelf life of strawberries, thereby decreasing product losses while increasing waste management efficiency at the level of a distribution platform and/or sales outlet. In the event of product deterioration or non-sale of the product, the packaging and its contents could be collected together as organic waste without any additional processes because the packaging is compostable according to EN13432. Scenario 2 would achieve reductions of 20% in the global warming potential and non-renewable energy impact categories.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiobased products 3abiodegradability 3acarbon dioxide 3acomposting 3acrops 3aenergy 3aenvironmental assessment 3aenvironmental impact 3afarm to fork 3aglobal warming 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3aindustry 3alife cycle assessment 3amulching 3aorganic wastes 3apackaging 3apackaging materials 3apolyethylene 3apostharvest technology 3arenewable resources 3asales 3ashelf life 3astrawberries 3aItaly 0aLCA 0aStrawberry 0aWaste 0aPackaging 0aMulching1 aPeano, Cristiana1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8860-01391 aBaudino, Claudio1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7224-08421 aTecco, Nadia0 tScience of the total environment.g2014 Mar. 01, v. 473-474 p.48-53dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2013.11.1333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03092naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001200148245014600160300001800306520159200324592002801916596001901944650001901963650001801982650001702000650001502017650001402032650002702046650001602073650001402089650001602103650001802119650001402137650001602151650001802167650002002185650001402205650001802219700001602237700001402253700001502267700001602282700001402298700005502312773013902367856008302506852000902589655001202598IND60710602820221120035409.0211021e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071060282DNAL7 a10.1007/s00122-020-03636-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Le10aEffect of germination potential on storage lipids and transcriptome changes in premature developing seeds of oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.)  ap. 2839-2852.  aKEY MESSAGE : We provided a gene pool of moderate size for selecting or manipulating the candidate genes that favour the acquisition of seed dormancy, shedding light on the elevation of seed oil content in oilseed rape by blocking lipid degradation in developing seeds. In oilseed rape, the association between the germination potential of premature seeds and the final level of seed lipids, and the underlying mechanism, is elusive. Here, we investigated phenotypic differences in the germination percentage of premature seeds in a collection of oilseed rape cultivars. We compared the dynamic lipid accumulation between the deep-, moderate- and non-dormant genotypes and compared the transcriptomes of the seeds at 40 days after pollination between multiple pairs of deep- and non-dormant genotypes. We identified a wide range of differences in germination percentage of premature seeds and the association between the germination potential and the change of fatty acid content at late stage of seed maturation. The comparisons of transcriptomes between deep- and non-dormant seeds revealed the genetic basis for the dormant difference, e.g. the different expression levels of the genes involved in gibberellic and abscisic acid biosynthesis and/or signalling, fatty acid metabolic pathways, and the structure of seed cell wall. We provided a gene pool of moderate size for selecting or manipulating the candidate genes that favour the acquisition of seed dormancy, shedding light on the elevation of seed oil content in oilseed rape by blocking lipid degradation in developing seeds.  aPublisher supplied data  a31671597cNSFC 3aBrassica napus 3aabscisic acid 3abiosynthesis 3acell walls 3acultivars 3afatty acid composition 3afatty acids 3agene pool 3agermination 3alipid content 3aphenotype 3apollination 3aseed dormancy 3aseed maturation 3aseed oils 3atranscriptome1 aZhao, Xinze1 aXu, Ying,1 aWang, Qian1 aWang, Haoyi1 aWu, Dezhi1 aJiang, Lixi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8579-07630 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g2020 Oct., v. 133, no. 10 p.2839-2852dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl2874x0040-57527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00122-020-03636-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04046naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024003000121040001800151100002400169245014300193300001600336500002000352520250800372592002802880650001802908650002102926650002202947650001102969650002302980650003003003650001903033650000903052650001203061650001203073650001503085650002103100650001103121650001103132650001603143650001503159650001003174650001703184650001003201650001303211651003103224700002703255700001803282773012103300856007303421961001303494852000903507655001203516IND60571265920221118234656.0170712e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057126592DNAL7 a10.1111/eea.125732doi7 a10.1111/eea.125732chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWheeler, Gregory S.10aQuarantine host range of Bikasha collaris, a potential biological control agent of Chinese tallowtree (Triadica sebifera) in North America  ap. 184-196.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aChinese tallowtree, Triadica sebifera (L.) Small (Euphorbiaceae), is one of the worst invasive weeds of the southeastern USA impacting coastal wetlands, forests, and natural areas. Traditional mechanical and chemical controls have been unable to limit the spread, and this invasive species continues to expand its range. A proposed biological control candidate, the flea beetle Bikasha collaris (Baly) (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), shows high specificity for the target weed Chinese tallowtree. Results from a series of no‐choice and choice feeding tests of B. collaris adults and larvae indicated that this flea beetle was highly specific to Chinese tallowtree. The larvae of B. collaris feed by tunneling in the roots, whereas the adults feed on the leaves of Chinese tallowtree. A total of 77 plant taxa, primarily from members of the tallow plant family Euphorbiaceae, were tested in numerous test designs. Larval no‐choice tests indicated that larvae completed development only on two of the non‐target taxa. Of 80 B. collaris larvae fed roots of Hippomane mancinella L. and 50 larvae fed roots of Ricinus communis L., two and three larvae completed development, respectively. The emerging adults of these five larvae died within 3 days without reproducing. Larval choice tests also indicated little use of these non‐target taxa. Adult no‐choice tests indicated little leaf damage by B. collaris on the non‐targets except for Ditrysinia fruticosa (Bartram) Govaerts & Frodin and Gymnanthes lucida Sw. When given a choice, however, B. collaris adults consumed much less of the non‐targets D. fruticosa (7.4%) and G. lucida (6.1%) compared with the control leaves. Finally, no‐choice oviposition tests indicated that no eggs were produced when adults were fed all non‐target taxa, except those fed G. lucida. These B. collaris adults fed G. lucida leaves produced an average of 4.6 eggs compared with 115.0 eggs per female when fed Chinese tallowtree. The eggs produced from adults fed G. lucida were either inviable or the emerging larvae died within 1 day. These results indicate that the flea beetle B. collaris was unable to complete its life cycle on any of the non‐target taxa tested. If approved for field release, B. collaris will be the first biological control agent deployed against Chinese tallowtree in the USA. This flea beetle may play an important role in suppressing Chinese tallowtree and contribute to the integrated control of this invasive weed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChrysomelidae 3aRicinus communis 3aTriadica sebifera 3aadults 3abiological control 3abiological control agents 3achoice feeding 3aeggs 3afemales 3aforests 3ahost range 3ainvasive species 3alarvae 3aleaves 3aoviposition 3aquarantine 3aroots 3aweed control 3aweeds 3awetlands 3aSoutheastern United States1 aSteininger, M.

Cultivar GA 10 showed higher, IGP 76 and No. 71 moderate, and IGPN 2004 least reduction in percent seed germination given PEG stress treatments (0, 10 and 20%). A similar pattern was observed for decreased growth and water content of the seedlings and plants of the cultivars exposed to both kinds of water-deficit stresses. The productivity (number of capitula per plant, number of seeds per capitula and 1,000-seed weight) and total chlorophyll content of cultivar IGPN 2004 was significantly higher in comparison to other cultivars given different FC% treatments (100, 80 and 60%). Significantly higher accumulation of proline, glycine betaine and total soluble sugars and lower damage to membrane lipids under increased water-deficit stress (i.e., at 80 and 60% FC) conditions in cultivar IGPN 2004 suggested its more tolerance capacity to water-deficit stress in comparison to other cultivars. Besides, antioxidant enzyme activities (superoxide dismutase, catalase, ascorbate peroxidase and guaiacol peroxidase) partially demonstrated variations in the tolerance of the cultivars to water-deficit stress. The results suggest that cultivar IGPN 2004 could be considered as more tolerant, and IGP 76 and No. 71 as moderately tolerant, whereas GA 10 was more sensitive to water-deficit stress.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGuizotia abyssinica 3aascorbate peroxidase 3abetaine 3acatalase 3achlorophyll 3acultivars 3adrought 3aenzyme activity 3afield capacity 3alipids 3aperoxidase 3aseed germination 3aseedlings 3aseeds 3asugars 3asuperoxide dismutase 3awater content1 aLokhande, V.

Fusarium coicis from Coix gasteenii, F. goolgardi from Xanthorrhoea glauca, F. mundagurra from soil and Mangifera indica, F. newnesense from soil, F. tjaetaba from Sorghum interjectum and F. tjaynera from soil, Triodia microstachya, Sorghum interjectum and Sorghum intrans. Morphology and phylogenetic analysis of EF-1α, RPB1 and RPB2 sequence data were used to delineate species boundaries. The new species were phylogenetically distributed in the Fusarium sambucinum, F. fujikuroi, and F. chlamydosporum species complexes, and two novel species complexes. These six new species have particular phylogeographic significance as not only do they provide further insight into the geographic patterns of Fusarium evolution but also challenge current phylogeographic hypotheses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCoix 3aFusarium sambucinum 3aMangifera indica 3aSorghum (Poaceae) 3aTriodia 3aXanthorrhoea 3aanthropogenic activities 3aecosystems 3ahosts 3anew species 3aphylogeny 3aphylogeography 3asoil 3aAustralia1 aWalsh, J.

On the other hand, they play different roles in the provision of Ecosystem Services (ES). Therefore, identifying and understanding the relationships between species and humans, and the delivery of ES is crucial for sustainable management of the environment. The objectives of this study were to identify ecological functions of birds and mammals and its conflicts with human activities reported by previous articles in the Pampas region; and to link these ecological functions as indicators of the potential ES provided by these species. We performed two systematic and structured searches of articles using Scopus bibliographic database, one for the ecological functions and the second one for conflicts. From the first search, we found 145 studies and 34% of them reported ecological functions, 78% were about birds and the rest about mammals. The Regulation and Maintenance ES were the most reported type and involved the provision of nutrients and pest control, with birds of prey and carnivorous mammals as the most mentioned groups. Provisioning ES were related to the provision of leather from legal hunting and genetic material, and Cultural ES were associated to species conservation. From the conflict search, we found 23 studies that mentioned negative interactions in the Pampas region, mostly with birds and associated to agricultural production damages. Many species mentioned as important ES providers, are also involved in conflicts, causing some discomfort to people. Therefore, the integration of wildlife, with its benefits and damages, could be a powerful argument to achieve the coexistence of wildlife into a landscape shaped by anthropogenic activities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagroecosystems 3acarnivores 3adatabases 3ahumans 3alandscapes 3aleather 3apeople 3apest control 3awildlife 3aArgentina 0aBenefits 0aConflicts 0aHuman-wildlife coexistence 0aBirds 0aMammals1 aBernad, Lucía1 aPedrana, Julieta0 tEcological indicators.g2020 Oct., v. 117 p.106576-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.1065763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01953naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245006300164300001600227520085500243592002801098650001101126650001301137650001401150650001101164651001201175653003201187653001201219653001501231653001801246653001401264700001801278700002101296700002301317773014801340856008201488852000901570655001201579IND60607389520221121191457.0180904e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060738952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.esd.2016.01.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEzeoha, Abel10aRelevance lost? The Petroleum Equalization Fund in Nigeria  ap. 152-162.  aThis paper traces the origins of the Petroleum Equalization Fund (PEF) in Nigeria and describes the environment in which it has operated. The paper argues that the PEF has failed to live up to its mandate of equalizing the prices of petroleum products across the country. This is in part because such equalization schemes create arbitrage opportunities which are always prone to exploitation. The rentier nature of the Nigerian state and the prevalence of corruption in the country have added fodder to such exploitations. The consequence of the above is that PEF has simply become one of the inefficient channels of subsidizing the price of petroleum products in Nigeria. This paper therefore recommends that the starting point in the efforts by the Nigerian government to undertake petrol subsidy reform in the country should be to abolish the PEF.  aPublisher supplied data 3aforage 3agasoline 3apetroleum 3aprices 3aNigeria 0aPetroleum Equalization Fund 0aNigeria 0aCorruption 0aRentier State 0aArbitrage1 aIgwe, Anthony1 aOnyeke, Chibueze1 aUche, Chibuike U.,0 tEnergy for sustainable development.g2016 Apr., v. 31 p.152-162dElsevier Inc.aInternational Energy InitiativewJournal:12424x0973-08267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.esd.2016.01.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02830naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245013200164300001600296520118500312592002801497650003401525650002001559650002501579650002301604650002501627650001701652650002201669650002101691650001501712650001701727650002101744650003101765650002701796653002301823653002601846653002501872653002901897653002901926700002101955700001601976700002001992700001602012700001802028700001802046700001802064700001502082773011202097856008202209852000902291655001202300IND60612316820221121063758.0190415e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061231682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jff.2018.04.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Xue-Gui10aBioactive constituents from Medicago sativa L. with antioxidant, neuroprotective and acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activities  ap. 371-380.  aMedicago sativa L. is an important source of functional foods and supplements, which can improve human health. The present work was carried out to search for potential antioxidants from M. sativa to treat neurodegeneration. Four new isoflavane glycosides (1–4) were isolated from M. sativa, along with seven known compounds (5–11). Their structures including absolute configurations were elucidated by multi-spectroscopic data analyses, chemical methods, and quantum chemical ECD calculations. The compounds (1–11) were tested for their antioxidant activity using 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), 2,2′-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonicacid) (ABTS) and Ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assays. All the isolated compounds displayed different degrees of antioxidant effects. Meanwhile, some isolates also possessed acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitory activities. A possible mechanism of interaction between the active compounds and AChE was also investigated by molecular docking studies. Furthermore, compounds (1–6 and 10–11) exhibited potent neuroprotective effects against H2O2-induced cellular damage in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aMedicago sativa 3aacetylcholinesterase 3aactive ingredients 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3aenzyme inhibition 3afunctional foods 3aglycosides 3ahuman health 3amolecular models 3aneurodegenerative diseases 3aneuroprotective effect 0aMedicago sativa L. 0aIsoflavane glycosides 0aAntioxidant activity 0aAChE inhibitory activity 0aNeuroprotective activity1 aHuang, Ming-Yuan1 aGao, Pin-Yi1 aLiu, Chang-Feng1 aSun, Yu-Qiu1 aLv, Meng-Chao1 aYao, Guo-Dong1 aZhang, Li-Xin1 aLi, Dan-Qi0 tJournal of functional foods.g2018 June, v. 45 p.371-380dElsevier LtdwJournal:J000000142x1756-46467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jff.2018.04.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03191naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245014700165300001600312520162100328592002801949650003701977650001602014650002402030650001402054650001702068650002602085650002002111650001202131650002202143650002302165650001002188650003102198650001402229650002202243650002202265650001002287650002002297700002102317700001902338700001602357700002102373700002102394700003002415700002302445700001902468773009602487856008102583852000902664655001202673IND60520727720221118000502.0160522e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052072772DNAL7 a10.1007/s13225-015-0341-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHoppe, Björn10aLinking molecular deadwood-inhabiting fungal diversity and community dynamics to ecosystem functions and processes in Central European forests  ap. 367-379.  aFungi play vital roles in the decomposition of deadwood due to their secretion of various enzymes that break down plant cell-wall complexes. The compositions of wood-inhabiting fungal (WIF) communities change over the course of the decomposition process as the remaining mass of wood decreases and both abiotic and biotic conditions of the wood significantly change. It is currently not resolved which substrate-related factors govern these changes in WIF communities and whether such changes influence the deadwood decomposition rate. Here we report a study on fungal richness and community structure in deadwood of Norway spruce and European beech in temperate forest ecosystems using 454 pyrosequencing. Our aims were to disentangle the factors that correspond to WIF community composition and to investigate the links between fungal richness, taxonomically-resolved fungal identity, and microbial-mediated ecosystem functions and processes by analyzing physico-chemical wood properties, lignin-modifying enzyme activities and wood decomposition rates. Unlike fungal richness, we found significant differences in community structure between deadwood of different tree species. The composition of WIF communities was related to the physico-chemical properties of the deadwood substrates. Decomposition rates and the activities of lignin-modifying enzymes were controlled by the succession of the fungal communities and competition scenarios rather than fungal OTU richness. Our results provide further insights into links between fungal community structure and microbial-mediated ecosystem functions and processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFagus sylvatica subsp. sylvatica 3aPicea abies 3acommunity structure 3adead wood 3adecayed wood 3aecological succession 3aenzyme activity 3aenzymes 3aforest ecosystems 3afungal communities 3afungi 3aphysicochemical properties 3asecretion 3asequence analysis 3atemperate forests 3atrees 3awood properties1 aPurahong, Witoon1 aWubet, Tesfaye1 aKahl, Tiemo1 aBauhus, Jürgen,1 aArnstadt, Tobias1 aHofrichter, M.q(Martin),1 aBuscot, François,1 aKrüger, Dirk,0 tFungal diversity.g2016 Mar., v. 77, no. 1 p.367-379dSpringer Netherlandsx1560-27457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13225-015-0341-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03474naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245012800169300001600297520197800313592002802291650001802319650002802337650001302365650002102378650001502399650002702414650001802441650001402459650001002473650001202483650001402495650001202509653000702521653000902528653000802537653000802545653000802553653000902561653000802570653002502578653003802603653001102641653002302652653002802675700002002703700002402723700002002747773007402767856008202841852000902923655001202932IND60552444820221118025302.0161021e20150125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055244482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gene.2014.11.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorita, Shinichi10aAnalysis of spatiotemporal expression and function of the single-minded homolog in the branchiopod crustacean Daphnia magna  ap. 335-345.  aIn insect Drosophila melanogaster, ventral midline cells are crucial to formation of the central nervous system (CNS) and have roles in the specification of ectodermal neuroblasts. Notably, midline cells also have more recently recognized roles in the formation of the higher crustacean Parhyale dorso-ventral axis. The single-minded is a master regulator of ventral midline cells and is required for these functions. Recently sim expression patterns have been reported in various arthropods. These results suggest that the midline precursors evolved from ventral neuroectoderm of common ancestor Mandibulata. However, sim function has been only analyzed in few organisms. To investigate whether these functions of sim, the gene encoding Single-minded, are conserved among insects and crustaceans, we examined the embryonic expression pattern of a lower crustacean Daphnia sim homolog (dma sim) and analyzed the function of dma sim during embryonic development. The Dma Sim protein was expressed in the ventral neuroectoderm (like in onychophoran and chelicerate) and midline (like in mandibulatan). In addition to this conserved ventral neuroectoderm and midline expression, Dma Sim was expressed outside the ventral midline; it was expressed in maxilla 2, presumptive shell glands, and other tissues. To investigate dma sim function, we used RNA interference (RNAi) to inhibit dma sim in Daphnia embryos. Embryos subjected to dma sim RNAi exhibited improper axon tract formation and abnormal limb and ventral development. Furthermore, RNAi-mediated knockdown of dma slit, a putative Dma Sim target gene, resulted in similar embryonic phenotypes. These results indicated that dma sim might be required for proper dma slit-mediated ventral development in addition to being required for a conserved role in the ventral midline. Our findings indicated that sim homologs might have provided different developmental functions to ventral midline cells during metazoan evolution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDaphnia magna 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3aParhyale 3aRNA interference 3aarthropods 3acentral nervous system 3aembryogenesis 3aevolution 3agenes 3ainsects 3aphenotype 3atissues 0abp 0acDNA 0aPCR 0aORF 0aDIG 0aFITC 0aNHS 0aVentral midline cell 0aVentral neuroectoderm development 0aNeuron 0aExpression pattern 0aRNA interference (RNAi)1 aShiga, Yasuhiro1 aTokishita, Shinichi1 aOhta, Toshihiro0 tGene.g2015 Jan. 25, v. 555 p.335-345dElsevier B.V.x0378-11197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2014.11.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03361naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005600142245013300198300001800331500002000349520186800369592002802237596003802265596004702303596004702350650004102397650001902438650002302457650001502480650001202495650001502507650001302522650001502535650001502550650001602565650001602581650001502597650001202612700006202624700001702686773012602703856007702829852000902906655001202915IND60788042520221118114956.0220811e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078804252DNAL7 a10.1029/2017WR0211472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRajib, Adnan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2302-142110aRationale and Efficacy of Assimilating Remotely Sensed Potential Evapotranspiration for Reduced Uncertainty of Hydrologic Models  ap. 4615-4637.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe objective of this study is to systematically attribute sources of evapotranspiration uncertainty in a hydrologic model and accordingly propose a remote sensing‐based solution. Using Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) for three U.S. watersheds, representing different geophysical settings, this study first addresses the effects of parameter equifinality, energy‐related weather input uncertainty, and limited process representation on evapotranspiration simulation. Remotely sensed 8‐day total actual evapotranspiration (AET) from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) is used as a reference to evaluate the model outcome. Results indicate the likelihood of a pseudo‐accurate model showing high streamflow prediction skill despite severely erroneous spatiotemporal dynamics of AET. As a remedial measure, a hybrid daily potential evapotranspiration (PET) estimate, derived from MODIS, is directly ingested at each hydrologic response unit of the model to create a new configuration called SWAT‐PET. A key contribution is the modified SWAT source code that integrates the model (i.e., SWAT‐PET) with an automatic remote sensing data processor. The underlying notion is that remotely sensed PET works as a surrogate of actual vegetation dynamics, biophysical processes, and energy balance, without overruling the model's built‐in soil moisture accounting. Noticeably, increased accuracy of soil moisture, AET, and streamflow in SWAT‐PET, compared to independent sources of observations/reference estimates (i.e., field sensor, satellite, and gauge stations), approves the efficacy of the proposed approach toward improved physical consistency of hydrologic modeling. While the idea is tested for a past period, the ultimate goal is to improve near‐real‐time hydrologic forecasting once such PET estimates become available.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Science Foundation (NSF)  aOCI‐1148090cNational Science Foundation  aOCI‐1041379cNational Science Foundation 3aSoil and Water Assessment Tool model 3aenergy balance 3aevapotranspiration 3ageophysics 3ahybrids 3aprediction 3aresearch 3asatellites 3asoil water 3astream flow 3auncertainty 3avegetation 3aweather1 aMerwade, Venkatesh1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5518-28901 aYu, Zhiqiang0 tWater resources research.g2018 July, v. 54, no. 7 p.4615-4637dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl46306x0043-13977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2017WR0211473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02383naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094024002200124024001900146040001800165100002600183245009200209506007600301520115700377592002801534506003701562650001101599650001801610650001601628650001101644650001901655650002401674650002301698650001601721650001201737650002101749700002401770773011801794856007601912852000901988655001201997IND60654570320221207074249.0190725e20190719xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065457032DNAL7 a10.3390/foods80702672doi7 aPMC66784282pmcid7 a313310212pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRomán Masedo, Laura,10aStructural Basis of Resistant Starch (RS) in Bread: Natural and Commercial Alternatives  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBread is categorized as having a high amount of rapidly digested starch that may result in a rapid increase in postprandial blood glucose and, therefore, poor health outcomes. This is mostly the result of the complete gelatinization that starch undergoes during baking. The inclusion of resistant starch (RS) ingredients in bread formulas is gaining prominence, especially with the current positive health outcomes attributed to RS and the apparition of novel RS ingredients in the market. However, many RS ingredients contain RS structures that do not resist baking and, therefore, are not suitable to result in a meaningful RS increase in the final product. In this review, the structural factors for the resistance to digestion and hydrothermal processing of RS ingredients are reviewed, and the definition of each RS subtype is expanded to account for novel non-digestible structures recently reported. Moreover, the current in vitro digestion methods used to measure RS content are critically discussed with a view of highlighting the importance of having a harmonized method to determine the optimum RS type and inclusion levels for bread-making.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abaking 3ablood glucose 3abreadmaking 3abreads 3agelatinization 3ahot water treatment 3ain vitro digestion 3aingredients 3amarkets 3aresistant starch1 aMartinez, Mario  M.0 tFoods.g2019 July 19, v. 8, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods80702673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03301naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001300153245009300166300001800259520164400277592002801921650001101949650001601960650001501976650001201991651001102003651001202014653000802026653001002034653000902044653000702053653000802060653000902068653000702077653000902084653003702093653000902130653000802139653000802147653000702155653000802162653001802170653002202188653002402210653002502234700001102259700005902270700005802329700002102387700001502408700001402423700001802437700001702455700001502472773010402487856008702591852000902678655001202687IND60545522620221117173935.0160902e20140215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054552262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2013.11.1382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZuo, Fei10aTemporal and spatial variability of traffic-related noise in the City of Toronto, Canada  ap. 1100-1107.  aThe majority of studies that assessed population-level exposure to traffic-related noise were conducted in European countries and less is known about the exposure to traffic noise in North America, particularly in Canadian cities. This study explored the temporal and spatial variability of traffic noise in the City of Toronto, the largest city in Canada. We conducted two cycles of intensive field measurement campaign to collect real-time measurements of traffic noise at 554 locations across Toronto between June 2012 and January 2013. At each site, we collected measurements for a period of 30min during daytime. Repeated measurements were made in cycle two at 62 locations randomly selected from cycle one, which exhibited high correlation (Pearson's correlation coefficient (r): 0.79). In addition, continuous measurements of noise were recorded for seven days at ten sites. We observed that noise variability was predominantly spatial in nature, rather than temporal: spatial variability accounted for 60% of the total observed variations in traffic noise. Traffic volume, length of arterial road, and industrial area were three most important variables, explaining the majority of the spatial variability of noise (R2=0.68 to 0.74, depending on the cycle). In comparison to the 16-h equivalent sound level guideline for outdoor locations set out by the Ministry of the Environment of the Province of Ontario, 80% of our sampled locations exceeded this guideline (i.e. 55 dBA,16h). These findings suggested ubiquitous traffic noise exposure across Toronto and that noise variability was explained mostly by spatial characteristics.  aPublisher supplied data 3acities 3acorrelation 3aguidelines 3atraffic 3aEurope 3aOntario 0aAIC 0aANOVA 0aCCHS 0aCI 0adBA 0aDMTI 0aEU 0aINLA 0aLeq (T), Leq 16h, Leq 8h, Leq 1h 0aMCMC 0aMOE 0aSLM 0aUS 0aWHO 0aTraffic noise 0aField measurement 0aSpatial variability 0aTemporal variability1 aLi, Ye1 aJohnson, Steven1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4344-89831 aJohnson, James1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7818-29571 aVarughese, Sunil1 aCopes, Ray1 aLiu, Fuan1 aWu, Hao Jiang1 aHou, Rebecca1 aChen, Hong0 tScience of the total environment.g2014 Feb. 15, v. 472 p.1100-1107dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2013.11.1383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03338naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245010400166520174700270592002802017650001602045650001202061650001402073650002302087650002302110650001102133650001502144650001402159650001202173650001702185650002102202650001402223650000902237650001402246650001602260650001102276651001002287653000802297653000802305653004002313653001102353653002202364653005002386700001902436700001602455700001602471700001602487700001602503700001602519700001302535700001102548773010702559856008502666852000902751655001202760IND60686537520221119131947.0200809e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068653752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2020.1142802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Liqiang10aOn-road emission measurements of reactive nitrogen compounds from heavy-duty diesel trucks in China  aEmissions of major reactive nitrogen compounds, including nitric oxide (NO), nitrogen dioxide (NO₂) and ammonia (NH₃), from heavy-duty diesel vehicles (HDDVs) place substantial pressure on air quality for many large cities in China. To control nitrogen oxide (NOX) emissions from HDDVs, selective catalytic reduction (SCR) systems have been widely used since the China IV standards. To investigate the impacts of aftertreatment technologies and driving conditions on real-world emissions of reactive nitrogen compounds, a portable emissions measurement system was employed to test eighteen heavy-duty diesel trucks in China. The results showed that the China IV and China V HDDVs with appropriate SCR functionality could reduce NOX emissions by 36% and 53%, respectively, compared to the China III results, although their real-world emissions were still higher than the corresponding emission limits for regulatory engine tests. For these HDDVs, five samples were tested with NH₃ emissions, ranging from 1.67 ppm to 51.49 ppm. The NH₃ emission rates tended to significantly increase under high-speed driving conditions. The results indicate that the current SCR technology may have certain risks in exceeding the future China VI NH₃ limit. However, five China IV/V HDDVs were found to have SCR temperature sensors that were intentionally tampered with, resulting in comparable or even higher NOX emissions and zero NH₃ emissions. Increased NO₂ emissions due to the adoption of diesel oxidation catalysts and diesel particulate filters were also found from our experiments. This study highlights the importance of enhancing in-use compliance requirements and eliminating aftertreatment tampering for China IV and China V HDDVs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair quality 3aammonia 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3achemical reduction 3acities 3acompliance 3aemissions 3afilters 3anitric oxide 3anitrogen dioxide 3aoxidation 3arisk 3atampering 3atemperature 3atrucks 3aChina 0aNOX 0aNH3 0aSelective catalytic reduction (SCR) 0aDiesel 0aVehicle emissions 0aPortable emissions measurement systems (PEMS)1 aZhang, Shaojun1 aHu, Jingnan1 aLi, Zhenhua1 aZheng, Xuan1 aCao, Yihuan1 aXu, Guangyi1 aYan, Min1 aWu, Ye0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2020 July, v. 262 p.114280-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2020.1142803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02418naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002200153245011000175300001600285520132400301592002801625650000901653650002001662650001101682650000901693650001901702650001201721650001901733650001101752650001301763650001301776650001301789700002201802700002001824773010201844856008901946852000902035655001202044IND60561580720221118003352.0170119e20170119xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056158072DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.6b021962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSakurovs, Richard10aRearrangement in Brown Coal Microstructure upon Drying As Measured by Ultrasmall-Angle Neutron Scattering  ap. 231-238.  aSmall-angle scattering can supply information about the microporosity of wet materials, unlike techniques such as gas sorption and mercury porosimetry. In this study, we applied the ultrasmall-angle neutron scattering (USANS) technique to compare the microstructure of brown coals before and after drying and after rewetting the dried coal, in the size range from 25 nm to 10 μm. We found that scattering of neutrons from brown coal is substantially greater when dried than when wet. Because we found that materials that shrink uniformly on all size scales must scatter neutrons to a lesser extent when dried than when wet, the microstructure of brown coal must be different when it is wet from when it is dry. This difference in the brown coal microstructure is on sizes of <100 nm. The change in the microstructure is probably due to clustering of the molecules making up the brown coal into locally denser regions when the coal is dried, which is consistent with the gel structure model for wet brown coal. Brown coal that had been heat-treated wet at 300 °C showed no evidence of such a restructure after being dried. We also found that D₂O extensively penetrates pores of brown coal, even in the brown coal that had been heat-treated, and that the nature of the pores in the wet coal varies with the pore size.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoal 3adeuterium oxide 3adrying 3agels 3aheat treatment 3amercury 3amicrostructure 3amodels 3aneutrons 3aporosity 3asorption1 ade Campo, Liliana1 aRehm, Christine0 tEnergy & Fuels.g2017 Jan. 19, v. 31, no. 1 p.231-238dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.energyfuels.6b021963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02154naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245011700171500001900288520101600307592002801323650001201351650001501363650001001378650001701388650001101405651001001416653001701426653002501443653003701468653003401505700001701539700001301556700001501569773010101584856008601685852000901771655001201780IND60700117320221120124703.0201111e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070011732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.1066232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Qingtian10aInfluence of methodological choices on results of macrofaunal functional feeding diversity and evenness analyses  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMethodological choices made when studying functional feeding groups (FFGs) may influence the outcome of feeding diversity analyses and of the ecological quality assessment. We assessed the impact of select methodological choices based on seasonal macrobenthos surveys carried out in Bohai Bay, China. Results of the paired-sample t test showed that the choice to remove rare species from analyses had influence on the outcome of ecosystem evaluations based on FFG diversity (t = 2.328, p = 0.023). On the other hand, although results at some stations indicated that the removal of rare species did not affect feeding diversity and ecological assessment, it increased the research effort. Evenness feeding diversity calculated from FFG biomass data showed a remarkably different spatio-temporal distribution from that of values based on abundance data, with no clear relationship between the two. If biomass data are used to estimate FFG diversity, a revised ecological assessment scale may need to be developed.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3aecosystems 3afauna 3arare species 3at-test 3aChina 0aMacrobenthos 0aFunctional diversity 0aEvenness feeding diversity index 0aEcological quality assessment1 aGong, Zijuan1 aLi, Jing1 aHu, Guikun0 tEcological indicators.g2020 Oct., v. 117 p.106623-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.1066233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03508naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005800142245009900200300001800299500002000317520185000337592002802187596006602215596003202281650001502313650002002328650001402348650001602362650002102378650001402399650001302413650001302426650002402439650002502463650002202488651001102510700005702521700005902578700005602637700005702693700005902750700001702809773012602826856007702952852000903029655001203038IND60788042720221118115005.0220811e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078804272DNAL7 a10.1029/2017WR0223532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKurylyk, B.

Heat has been previously applied as a submarine groundwater tracer using an analytical solution to a heat flow equation assuming steady state conditions and homogeneous thermal conductivity. These assumptions are often violated in shallow seabeds due to ocean bottom temperature changes or sediment property variations. Here heat tracing analysis techniques recently developed for terrestrial settings are applied in concert to examine the influences of groundwater flow, ocean temperature changes, and seabed thermal conductivity variations on deep‐ocean sediment temperature profiles. Temperature observations from the sediment and bottom ocean water on the Scotian Slope off eastern Canada are used to demonstrate how simple thermal methods for tracing groundwater can be employed if more comprehensive techniques indicate that the simplifying assumptions are valid. The spatial distribution of the inferred groundwater fluxes on the slope suggests a downward groundwater flow system with recharge occurring over the upper‐middle slope and discharge on the lower slope. We speculate that the downward groundwater flow inferred on the Scotian Slope is due to density‐driven processes arising from underlying salt domes, in contrast with upward slope systems driven by geothermal convection. Improvements in the design of future submarine hydrogeological studies are proposed for thermal data collection and groundwater flow analysis, including new equations that quantify the minimum detectable flux magnitude for a given sensor accuracy and profile length.  aPublisher supplied data  c(Canadian) Federal Program of Energy Research and Development  cFisheries and Oceans Canada 3aconvection 3adata collection 3aequations 3agroundwater 3agroundwater flow 3aheat flow 3aresearch 3aseawater 3asediment properties 3athermal conductivity 3awater temperature 3aCanada1 aIrvine, D.

This work aims to assess heavy metal ecological risk in XKS using a potential ecological risk (PER) index and detect the responses of the soil bacterial community under heavy metal stress at different pH levels. The PER index indicated that antimony (Sb), cadmium (Cd), and arsenic (As) posed the most serious ecological risk at the sampling sites. We compared the effects of heavy metals on the structure of the microbial community under acidic and neutral conditions. Our results suggested significant differences between microbial community responses to heavy metals in acidic and neutral soils. Zinc (Zn) and lead (Pb) were the main heavy metal factors affecting the bacterial community under acidic conditions, whereas the effect of Sb, As, and chromium (Cr) exceeded them in neutral soils. This was possibly due to the different characteristics of heavy metals and their interactions with soil properties. The main genus were positively correlated with Sb, As, Zn, Pb, and Cd in both acidic and neutral soils, which may due to increasing resistance under conditions of long-time pollution. The results of our structural equation modeling indicated that the variations in the bacterial community structure were mainly explained by heavy metals in acidic and neutral soils. The soil nutrients and pH also had significant direct influences on the bacterial community under neutral conditions, as well as indirect effects due to their impact on heavy metals in neutral and acidic soils. Several heavy metal-resistant bacteria can be used for remediation under acid and neutral conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantimony 3aarsenic 3abacterial communities 3acadmium 3achromium 3acommunity structure 3aequations 3aheavy metals 3alead 3ametal tolerance 3apH 3apollution 3aremediation 3arisk 3asoil bacteria 3azinc 3aChina 0aXikuangshan 0aHeavy metal 0aBacterial community 0aSoil pH 0aEcological risk assessment1 aWang, Yating1 aChen, Qi1 aLi, Yongshuang1 aGuo, Dongchu1 aNie, Xiaohong1 aPeng, Xiawei0 tEcological indicators.g2020 Oct., v. 117 p.106626-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.1066263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01727naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094024002200128024001900150040001800169100002000187245010900207300001800316506007600334520035400410592002800764506003700792650004700829650002700876650001100903650001800914650004200932650002500974650001500999700001801014700001701032700001801049700001601067700001801083773012701101856008001228852000901308655001201317IND60117656020221207101836.0141126e20130627xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011765602DNAL7 a10.1128/genomeA.00408-132doi7 aPMC36954322pmcid7 a238140362pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJeong, Haeyoung10aGenome Sequence of the Vancomycin-Producing Amycolatopsis orientalis subsp. orientalis Strain KCTC 9412T  ap. e00408-13.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAmycolatopsis orientalis is the producer of vancomycin, a glycopeptide antibiotic that is used for the treatment of serious infections with Gram-positive bacteria.

(Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae: Nymphalini). We presented six fat‐free diet pairs to larvae in a choice trial to determine the ‘intake target’. In addition, we fed larvae seven fat‐free single diets differing in dietary nutrient ratio in no‐choice trials to determine the rules of compromise they exhibit when constrained to a singular, sub‐optimal dietary source. In choice trials, caterpillars regulated nutrient intake to a ratio of 1 protein to 1.09 carbohydrate (1P:1.09C), exhibiting tighter regulation of protein than of carbohydrate. Furthermore, larvae from different diet pair treatments did not differ in pupal mass or stadium duration. In no‐choice experiments, larvae reduced consumption on increasingly protein‐biased diets and increased consumption on increasingly carbohydrate‐biased diets, relative to a 1P:1C ratio diet. Differences in carbohydrate consumption were much greater between no‐choice treatments than differences in protein consumption. Dietary nutrient ratio affected pupal mass when accounting for initial larval mass. Pupal mass decreased as nutrient ratio was shifted off of 1P:1C, but to a greater extent when the ratio was skewed toward carbohydrate. Stadium duration increased as nutrient ratio diverged from 1P:1C, being more pronounced when shifted toward carbohydrate than toward protein. Regulation to near 1P:1C is consistent with results found for other Lepidoptera, and the rule of compromise exhibited by V. cardui is consistent with that expected for a generalist herbivore.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVanessa cardui 3acarbohydrates 3afat-free diet 3aherbivores 3ainsect larvae 3anutrient intake 3apupae1 aThompson, S.

Silicon (Si) has become a potential limiting nutrient due to disproportionate nitrogen, phosphorus, and silicate inputs into these areas. The disrupted nutrient ratios can cause changes to metal sensitivity and accumulation in marine diatoms, an important group of eukaryotic phytoplankton that requires silicon for growth. In this study, we examined the effects of Si availability on the metal sensitivity in the diatom P. tricornutum. We found that Si starvation dramatically compromised its cadmium, copper, and lead tolerances. Interestingly, multiple lines of evidence indicated that Si-enriched cells had higher metal adsorption and influx rates than Si-starved cells. Yet Si-enriched cells also had a greater ability to respond to and counteract metal toxicity via elevated expression of membrane and vacuolar metal transporters and greater antioxidant activities which scavenge reactive oxygen species created by metal stress.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhaeodactylum tricornutum 3aadsorption 3aanthropogenic activities 3aantioxidant activity 3acadmium 3acoastal water 3acopper 3alead 3ametal tolerance 3anitrogen 3anutrients 3aphosphorus 3aphytoplankton 3areactive oxygen species 3asilicates 3asilicon 3astoichiometry 3atoxicity 3atransporters 3avacuoles 0aDiatom 0aSilicon 0aMetal bioaccumulation 0aMetal transporter 0aMetal toxicity1 aMa, Jie1 aChen, Fengyuan1 aZou, Yue1 aWei, Yang1 aZhong, Huan1 aPan, Ke0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2020 July, v. 262 p.114331-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2020.1143313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01460naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245012200155300002000277520035900297592002800656650002400684650002000708650001400728650002900742650001100771650001500782700001500797700001200812700001500824700001500839700001800854700001900872773012400891856007401015852000901089655001201098IND60642162220221119235236.0190506e20171024xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064216222DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ra09053f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShen, Chao10aIodobenzene-catalyzed synthesis of aryl sulfonate esters from aminoquinolines via remote radical C–O cross-coupling  ap. 49436-49439.  aA simple and efficient approach is established for the iodobenzene-catalyzed synthesis of aryl sulfonate esters from aminoquinolines via remote radical C–O cross-coupling in the absence of any transition metal catalysts.

However, the effective utilization of this resource could be enabled by production of syngas (hydrogen, carbon monoxide, etc.) from lignite through gasification. Tar in the syngas generated using the fluidized bed gasifier must be removed, and the tar composition should be considered for the design of effective tar removal equipment. A new analysis and analytical methods of the tar were developed herein. Gas chromatograph mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and field desorption mass spectrometry (FD-MS) were used in combination to analyze the tar obtained during steam gasification of lignite at 1123 K using a laboratory-scale fluidized bed gasifier. The low-boiling-point components were previously identified by GC/MS. However, the combined use of GC/MS and FD-MS in the new approach presented herein enabled elucidation of the overall composition of tar, including the high-boiling-point components.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon monoxide 3adesorption 3afluidized beds 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3agasification 3ahydrogen 3alignite 3asteam 3asynthesis gas 3aJapan1 aMurakami, Takahiro1 aYasuda, Hajime0 tEnergy & Fuels.g2017 Jan. 19, v. 31, no. 1 p.249-254dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.energyfuels.6b022103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03997naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001900153245014000172300001600312520259300328592002802921650002502949650002302974650001602997650001403013650000903027650001503036650001103051650000903062650000703071650001403078650001103092650002103103650002003124650001903144650002203163650002003185650001603205700001803221700001803239700001803257700002603275700001403301773010203315856008903417852000903506655001203515IND60561581120221118003319.0170119e20170119xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056158112DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.6b022162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNguele, Ronald10aInteractions between Formation Rock and Petroleum Fluids during Microemulsion Flooding and Alteration of Heavy Oil Recovery Performance  ap. 255-270.  aIn situ emulsification/solubilization is an oil recovery technique routinely used to mobilize residual oil after the secondary oil production (waterflooding). The oil is produced after a subsequent reduction of interfacial tension between stranded crude oil and water in the reservoir. Herein, a recovery method is presented for heavy crude oils whose scheme consists of injection of a fully solubilized (or emulsified) oil. Theoretically, the fully solubilized oil, referred hereinafter as microemulsion formulation, reduces the viscous forces that keep residual oil stranded. Different microemulsion formulations were prepared ex situ from two heavy oils (API 11.5 and 16.6), micellar slugs (formulated from cationic Gemini surfactant), and low-saline water (0.1 wt % NaCl). Tertiary heavy oil recovery consisted of displacing residual oil from a waterflooded core by a specific microemulsion formulation followed by low-saline water, which acted as buffer solution. Thirty-one percent of initial oil-in-place (IOIP) was recovered from the waterflooded core by microemulsion followed by an incremental oil recovery of about 20% of IOIP with chase water. The oil recovery efficiency by microemulsion and chase water floodings was lowered to 15 and 28%, respectively, in a strong oil-wet core (i.e., non waterflooded core). Despite the promising results presented herein, the performance of the microemulsion formulations and thus the oil recovery efficiency were found to be strongly dependent on (1) the nature of the core, i.e., its mineralogy, (2) the wetting state of plug, and (3) the chemical composition advancing fluid. The microemulsion formulations prompted a series of chemical reactions which subsequently altered their performance as a displacing agent. Ion tracking analysis of the effluent fractions showed that the pH and concentration in divalent and/or monovalent ions were also altered at each stage of production. When the plug was not waterflooded, the oil was produced along with a deposit of sludge and a high emulsion cut. However, the use of preflush enriched with an alkali (Na₂CO₃) was found to abate both effects. Furthermore, the spectral analysis of effluent fractions revealed the formation of calcium bridges which are thought to alter the efficiency of microemulsion formulations. Also, a series of chemical schemes are proposed in this investigation to support these results. Lastly, this investigation proposes a simplified electrostatic model that explains further the formation of clusters which were promoted by propagation of displacing fluids.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical composition 3achemical reactions 3aemulsifying 3aemulsions 3aions 3amineralogy 3amodels 3aoils 3apH 3apetroleum 3asludge 3asodium carbonate 3asodium chloride 3asolubilization 3aspectral analysis 3asurface tension 3asurfactants1 aSasaki, Kyuro1 aSugai, Yuichi1 aOmondi, Brian1 aSaid Al-Salim, Hikmat1 aUeda, Ryo0 tEnergy & Fuels.g2017 Jan. 19, v. 31, no. 1 p.255-270dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.energyfuels.6b022163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03553naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006000150245011400210520173400324592002802058650001202086650002402098650002202122650002302144650002302167650002302190650001902213650001202232650001602244650001602260650002402276650002202300650001702322650001002339650001902349650001802368650001202386650001802398650001702416650001002433650001302443650002002456650001602476653001602492653001602508653001702524653002102541653001702562653001602579700002902595700001802624700002002642700002002662700002002682700002402702773010702726856008502833852000902918655001202927IND60686537820221119132014.0200809e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068653782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2020.1143532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuuskonen, Hannu1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5609-768X10aDo whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus) larvae show adaptive variation in the avoidance of microplastic ingestion?  aThe presence of microplastics in aquatic ecosystems has recently received increased attention. Small plastic particles may resemble natural food items of larval fish and other aquatic organisms, and create strong selective pressures on the feeding traits in exposed populations. Here, we examined if larval ingestion of 90 μm polystyrene microspheres, in the presence of zooplankton (Artemia nauplii, mean length = 433 μm), shows adaptive variation in the European whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus). A full-factorial experimental breeding design allowed us to estimate the relative contributions of male (sire) and female (dam) parents and full-sib family variance in early feeding traits, and also genetic (co)variation between these traits. We also monitored the magnitude of intake and elimination of microplastics from the alimentary tracts of the larvae. In general, larval whitefish ingested small numbers of microplastics (mean = 1.8, range = 0–26 particles per larva), but ingestion was marginally affected by the dam, and more strongly by the full-sib family variation. Microsphere ingestion showed no statistically significant additive genetic variation, and thus, no heritability. Moreover, microsphere ingestion rate covaried positively with the ingestion of Artemia, further suggesting that larvae cannot adaptively avoid microsphere ingestion. Together with the detected strong genetic correlation between food intake and microplastic intake, the results suggest that larval fish do not readily possess additive genetic variation that would help them to adapt to the increasing pollution by microplastics. The conflict between feeding on natural food and avoiding microplastics deserves further attention.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArtemia 3aCoregonus lavaretus 3aanimal adaptation 3aaquatic ecosystems 3aat-risk population 3aavoidance behavior 3adams (mothers) 3afemales 3afish larvae 3afood intake 3agenetic correlation 3agenetic variation 3aheritability 3amales 3amicroparticles 3amicroplastics 3anauplii 3aoral exposure 3apolystyrenes 3asires 3avariance 3awater pollution 3azooplankton 0aFish larvae 0aPolystyrene 0aMicrospheres 0aParental effects 0aAccumulation 0aElimination1 aSubiron i Folguera, Joan1 aKortet, Raine1 aAkkanen, Jarkko1 aVainikka, Anssi1 aJanhunen, Matti1 aKekäläinen, Jukka0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2020 July, v. 262 p.114353-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2020.1143533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02853naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004600094040001800140100001500158245014900173300001400322520156700336592002801903650001001931650002101941650001501962650002201977650001401999650001702013650003102030650001602061653001602077653000902093653002002102653002402122653002802146700002202174700002402196700002202220773009902242856009302341852000902434655001202443IND60634343920221119231359.0190328e20190415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063434392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.theriogenology.2019.02.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArai, Yuka10aIdentification of isoforms of calyculin A-sensitive protein phosphatases which suppress full-type hyperactivation in bull ejaculated spermatozoa  ap. 46-53.  aIn bull spermatozoa, extracellular Ca2+-dependent full-type hyperactivation, which is characterized by the asymmetrical beating in whole parts of the middle/principal pieces, is suppressed by calyculin A-sensitive protein phosphatases. The aim of this study was to identify isoforms of these protein phosphatases. Ejaculated spermatozoa were used for the investigation on effects of protein phosphatase inhibitors (calyculin A with high specificity for both of protein phosphatases 1 and 2A, and okadaic acid with relatively higher specificity for protein phosphatase 2A than protein phosphatase 1) on the induction of extracellular Ca2+-dependent full-type hyperactivation by incubation with CaCl2 and cAMP analog (cBiMPS). They were also used for the immunodetection of protein phosphatases 1α, 1β, 1γ, 2Aα and 2Aβ. Percentages of full-type hyperactivated spermatozoa significantly increased after incubation with calyculin A (10 nM) in a concentration-dependent manner of CaCl2 (0–3.42 mM), though only minor increases in the percentages of full-type hyperactivated spermatozoa were observed after incubation with okadaic acid (10 nM). Moreover, the immunodetection of protein phosphatase isoforms showed sperm connecting piece and flagellum included protein phosphatases 1α and 1γ, but did not do the other isoforms. These results suggest that calyculin A-sensitive and okadaic acid-less sensitive protein phosphatases (1α and 1γ) are suppressors for the extracellular Ca2+-dependent full-type hyperactivation in bull ejaculated spermatozoa.  aPublisher supplied data 3abulls 3acalcium chloride 3acyclic AMP 3aenzyme inhibitors 3aflagellum 3aokadaic acid 3aphosphoprotein phosphatase 3aspermatozoa 0aCalyculin A 0acAMP 0aHyperactivation 0aProtein phosphatase 0aProtein phosphorylation1 aSakase, Mitsuhiro1 aFukushima, Moriyuki1 aHarayama, Hiroshi0 tTheriogenology.g2019 Apr. 15, v. 129 p.46-53dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl5209x0093-691X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2019.02.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02548naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002700147245011600174300001600290520150300306592002801809650001301837650002601850650001201876650001201888650001201900650001301912650001401925650002501939700003501964700002701999773009402026856008102120852000902201655001202210IND60080199120221121192022.0150316e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008019912DNAL7 a10.1007/s11284-014-1163-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOlvera Vargas, Miguel,10aEnvironmental filters and patterns of tree regeneration in high altitude sub-tropical Quercus-dominated forests  ap. 711-721.  aWe investigated how environmental variables explain patterns of tree regeneration in high altitude sub-tropical Quercus-dominated forests by: (1) determining whether the seedling and sapling communities show non-random spatial patterns of floristic composition; (2) identifying which environmental variables explain the observed patterns of floristic composition; (3) examining if similarity in floristic composition is related to similarity in environmental variables. We used data gathered in permanent plots established across 10 km in high altitude sub-tropical Quercus-dominated forests. Our analyses consisted of unconstrained ordination analyses (Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling) to characterize the spatial patterns of floristic composition; constrained ordination analyses (Canonical correspondence analysis) to assess the contribution of environmental variables in explaining patterns of floristic composition and, the simple and partial Mantel test to correlate the floristic composition similarity to environmental similarity. Our results provided evidence of non-random spatial patterns of floristic distribution due to structured environmental filters such as canopy-related variables, litter, grazing and aspect. Floristic compositional similarity did not depend on geographical distance between sites or on differences in their environment; therefore a number of plots were similar in floristic composition, in both seedlings and saplings, but have no environmental similarity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaltitude 3abotanical composition 3afilters 3aforests 3agrazing 3asaplings 3aseedlings 3astatistical analysis1 aFigueroa-Rangel, Blanca Lorena1 aGuzmán, Ramón Cuevas0 tEcological research.g2014 July, v. 29, no. 4 p.711-721dSpringer-Verlagx0912-38147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11284-014-1163-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01264naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245003700166300001600203520030700219592002800526650001800554650001100572650004400583650001800627653001800645653002900663653001800692653001500710653001600725700001700741773010800758856005100866852000900917655001200926IND50075875420221122045134.0140410e20120401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007587542DNAL7 a10.1080/14786419.2010.5418862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJeelani, S.10aTriterpenoids from Arctium lappa  ap. 654-658.  aPhytochemical investigation of the leaves of Arctium lappa led to the isolation of two triterpenoids, characterised by NMR, IR and MS as 3α-hydroxylanosta-5,15-diene and 3α-acetoxy-hop-22(29)-ene. 3α-hydroxylanosta-5,15-diene is a new triterpenoid and is isolated for the first time from this genus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArctium lappa 3aleaves 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3atriterpenoids 0aArctium lappa 0atetracyclic triterpenoid 0aantibacterial 0aantifungal 0acarminative1 aKhuroo, M.A.0 tNatural product research.g2012 Apr. 1, v. 26, no. 7 p.654-658dTaylor & Francis Groupx1478-64277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14786419.2010.541886  aDNAL 7aarticle03701naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005600151245012600207300001400333520210400347592002802451650001302479650000802492650001202500650002202512650003002534650002302564650002702587650002502614650001502639650001402654650001502668650001502683650001102698650001802709650001502727653002402742653002602766653002202792653003302814653002502847700001602872700001702888700005202905700001402957700001602971773010102987856008603088852000903174655001203183IND60526461820221120040924.0190408e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052646182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoleng.2015.12.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Xiaoou1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7040-538310aOptimizing the operation of combined oxidation pond-constructed wetland ecosystems used for treating composite wastewater  ap. 64-76.  aGiven few studies refer to the employment of constructed wetlands to polish secondary effluent and purify runoff simultaneously prior to replenishment of surface water, lab-scale combined oxidation pond-constructed wetland ecosystems used for treating the composite wastewater were established in this study, and the effects of four factors, each at four levels, on the treatment efficiency of the system were investigated through orthogonal experiment. The tested factors were (i) ratio of five-day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5) to chemical oxygen demand (CODCr) (abbreviation B/C) in the influent, (ii) aeration position, (iii) aeration intensity (expressed as air/water ratio), and (iv) hydraulic residence time (HRT). Results showed that the sequence and degree of the influence of the tested factors were HRT**>aeration intensity**>aeration position*>B/C for CODCr removal, HRT**>aeration position*≈aeration intensity*>B/C for ammonia (NH4+-N) removal, HRT**>B/C**>aeration position**>aeration intensity** for total nitrogen (TN) removal and HRT**>aeration intensity>aeration position≈B/C for total phosphorus (TP) removal (* denotes significant influence (0.01<p<0.05) and ** denotes extremely significant influence (p≤0.01)). Although the optimal operating conditions for CODCr, NH4+-N, TN and TP removal in the system were quite different from each other, the comprehensive optimal operating conditions (B/C≈0.30, surface aeration, aeration intensity=3:1, HRT=2.0d) obtained by the comprehensive balance method for the operation of the whole system proved to be feasible and practicable, under which the average concentration removal percentages were 80.81%, 75.97%, 82.38% and 80.95% for CODCr, NH4+-N, TN and TP, respectively. Moreover, the wetland columns accounted for the greatest removal of pollutants in the combined system, while the oxidation pond conferred a buffer capacity to the system by allowing for high loading fluctuations and pre-treated the influent as well. This study also offers references for the analysis of the results of the multi-index orthogonal test.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaeration 3aair 3aammonia 3aammonium nitrogen 3abiochemical oxygen demand 3abuffering capacity 3achemical oxygen demand 3aconstructed wetlands 3aecosystems 3aoxidation 3aphosphorus 3apollutants 3arunoff 3asurface water 3awastewater 0aConstructed wetland 0aOrthogonal experiment 0aAeration position 0aComprehensive balance method 0aComposite wastewater1 aTian, Yimei1 aZhao, Xinhua1 aWu, Qing1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0501-11261 aPeng, Sen1 aYan, Lijian0 tEcological engineering.g2016 Mar., v. 88 p.64-76dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11630x0925-85747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2015.12.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03649naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001800153245013100171520175100302592002802053650002002081650001902101650001002120650002502130650001202155650001802167650002202185650001602207650001102223650001502234650001302249650001302262650002302275650002202298650002102320650001502341650001002356650002502366650001202391650001902403650001302422650001902435653002002454653001902474653002002493653001202513653002502525653002402550653002502574653002602599653001202625653001702637653001202654700002602666700002902692700002102721700006202742773009802804856008802902852000902990655001202999IND60724133520221120044559.0211213e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072413352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.phytochem.2020.1126452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCowan, Max F.10aVariation in production of cyanogenic glucosides during early plant development: A comparison of wild and domesticated sorghum  aDomestication has narrowed the genetic diversity found in crop wild relatives, potentially reducing plasticity to cope with a changing climate. The tissues of domesticated sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), especially in younger plants, are cyanogenic and potentially toxic. Species of wild sorghum produce lower levels of the cyanogenic glucoside (CNglc) dhurrin than S. bicolor at maturity, but it is not known if this is also the case during germination and early growth. CNglcs play multiple roles in primary and specialised metabolism in domesticated sorghum and other crop plants. In this study, the temporal and spatial distribution of dhurrin in wild and domesticated sorghum at different growth stages was monitored in leaf, sheath and root tissues up to 35 days post germination using S. bicolor and the wild species S. brachypodum and S. macrospermum as the experimental systems. Growth parameters were also measured and allocation of plant total nitrogen (N%) to both dhurrin and nitrate (NO₃⁻) was calculated. Negligible amounts of dhurrin were produced in the leaves of the two wild species compared to S. bicolor. The morphology of the two wild sorghums also differed from S. bicolor, with the greatest differences observed for the more distantly related S. brachypodum. S. bicolor had the highest leaf N% whilst the wild species had significantly higher root N%. Allocation of nitrogen to dhurrin in aboveground tissue was significantly higher in S. bicolor compared to the wild species but did not differ in the roots across the three species. The differences in plant morphology, dhurrin content and re-mobilisation, and nitrate/nitrogen allocation suggest that domestication has affected the functional roles of dhurrin in sorghum.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSorghum bicolor 3aclimate change 3acrops 3adevelopmental stages 3adhurrin 3adomestication 3agenetic variation 3agermination 3aleaves 3ametabolism 3anitrates 3anitrogen 3aplant biochemistry 3aplant development 3aplant morphology 3aplasticity 3aroots 3aspatial distribution 3atissues 3atotal nitrogen 3atoxicity 3awild relatives 0aSorghum bicolor 0aS. brachypodum 0aS. macrospermum 0aPoaceae 0aSecondary metabolite 0aCrop wild relatives 0aSeedling development 0aCyanogenic glucosides 0aNitrate 0aCyanogenesis 0aDhurrin1 aBlomstedt, Cecilia K.1 aMøller, Birger Lindberg1 aHenry, Robert J.1 aGleadow, Roslyn M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4756-04110 tPhytochemistry.g2021 Apr., v. 184 p.112645-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl44710x0031-94227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phytochem.2020.1126453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02809naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245014500164300001600309520155200325592002801877650002101905650001201926650001001938650001101948650000901959650001501968650001101983650002601994650001202020650001102032650002102043650000902064650001002073650001302083650001902096651001002115700001802125700001802143700001802161773009402179856008102273852000902354655001202363IND60080199220221121192049.0150316e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008019922DNAL7 a10.1007/s11284-014-1164-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEmura, Naoko10aDimorphism of the seed-dispersing organ in a pantropical coastal plant, Scaevola taccada: heterogeneous population structures across islands  ap. 733-740.  aScaevola taccada is characterized by dimorphic fruits, with one type having cork and pulp (C-morph) and the other type having only pulp (NC-morph). Although within-individual dimorphism has not been observed, both morphs can occur at the same sites. The cork floats on seawater, and the pulp is eaten by birds. Thus, the morphs may have different seed dispersal abilities, via sea currents and birds, respectively. This study aimed to determine the functional characteristics of the dimorphic fruits. First, the potential seed dispersal ability of sea currents and birds was compared between the two fruits morphs by conducting a floating test and by measuring the proportions of different parts of the fruits, respectively. Next, the frequencies of the two morphs across different substrates (beaches, rocks, and cliffs) in the southern islands around Japan were analyzed. Most C-morph fruits remained floating for more than 180 days in a seawater tank, whereas all NC-morph fruits sank after approximately 1 week. The NC-morph fruits had a more pulp volume and less indigestible material than the C-morph fruits. Although both types of plants were found on many islands and all substrates, the C-morph was dominant on beaches, whereas the NC-morph was most frequent on cliffs. The frequencies of the morphs on different substrates might be influenced by the differences in their seed dispersal abilities. The two morphs may differ in fitness on different substrates. These findings improve our understanding of plant adaptations for dispersal.  aPublisher supplied data 3aScaevola taccada 3abeaches 3abirds 3acliffs 3acork 3adimorphism 3afruits 3afunctional properties 3aislands 3amorphs 3aplant adaptation 3apulp 3arocks 3aseawater 3aseed dispersal 3aJapan1 aDenda, Tetsuo1 aSakai, Miyuki1 aUeda, Keisuke0 tEcological research.g2014 July, v. 29, no. 4 p.733-740dSpringer-Verlagx0912-38147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11284-014-1164-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01634naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245008900164300001400253520046400267592002800731650001400759650001300773650001100786650002000797650002300817650002200840650002500862650001300887650001900900653001400919653002000933653002900953653003000982700001801012700001801030773009401048856008501142852000901227655001201236IND60544340520221118041209.0190415e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054434052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.margen.2014.06.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Yang10aPermanent draft genome of the malachite-green-tolerant bacterium Rhizobium sp.

The highest percentage of motile sperm was noted in the semen samples from males held in basins, while the lowest percentage of motile sperm and the highest protein content was confirmed in the samples from spawners held in ponds. Sperm motility and the osmolality of the seminal plasma were low in all the spawner groups; this may indicate contamination with urine. As the content of protein rose in the plasma and the sperm concentration increased, so did their motility.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSander lucioperca 3abasins 3acages 3amales 3amilt 3aosmolality 3aosmotic pressure 3aponds 3aprotein content 3arearing 3aseminal plasma 3aseminal plasma proteins 3asperm concentration 3asperm motility 3aspermatozoa 3atanks 3aurine 0aPikeperch 0aMilt 0aHCG 0aSeminal Plasma 0aContaminated Semen1 aGlogowski, Jan1 aKowalski, Radosław1 aKucharczyk, Dariusz1 aTargońska, Katarzyna0 tArchiwum rybactwa polskiego =.g2008 Dec. 30, v. 16, no. 1 p.93-100dVersitax2083-61397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/s10086-008-0008-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03081naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002600148245014100174300001600315520165400331592002801985650001002013650001502023650002002038650000902058650001002067650001202077650001602089650001802105650000902123650001902132650001202151650001202163650001102175650002102186653000802207653003102215653001102246653001302257653001702270700001802287700001902305700002102324700002102345773012902366856008302495852000902578655001202587IND60533762920221118221712.0190412e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053376292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jveb.2014.07.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFarmer-Dougan, Valeri10aBehavior of hearing or vision impaired and normal hearing and vision dogs (Canis lupis familiaris): Not the same, but not that different  ap. 316-323.  aThe article compared behavioral characteristics of dogs (Canis lupis familiaris) labeled as hearing and/or vision impaired by their owners with cohort dogs labeled as having normal hearing and vision (NHV) by their owners. The Canine Behavioral Assessment and Research Questionnaire, developed by Hsu and Serpell (2003), was used to survey owners. Four hundred sixty-one dog owners completed the online survey, with 183 of these being owners of hearing and/or vision impaired (HVI) dogs. Data analysis revealed that HVI dogs were reported by owners to show less aggression, less excitement, and were less likely to engage in behaviors, such as chasing of rabbits and rolling in feces than their normally hearing/seeing (NHV) cohorts. HVI dogs, however, were reported to be more likely to chew inappropriate objects, consume feces, bark excessively, and engage in greater licking behavior. When owners were surveyed about the type of training method used, owners of HVI dogs were found to be more likely to use hand signs, physical prompts, or combination of these training methods. Owners of NHV dogs reported being more likely than owners of HVI dogs to use gestures or report no formal training with their dogs. The data provide evidence that HVI dogs are as trainable as NHV dogs, can make excellent pets, and show behavior that is well within the parameters of NHV dog behavior. Still, because of their sensory limitations, specialized training methods and adaptations should be implemented with these dogs. This may limit HVI dogs to owners who are motivated, understand the sensory deficits, and are willing to engage in the modified training.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCanis 3aaggression 3aanimal behavior 3adogs 3afeces 3ahearing 3amastication 3apet ownership 3apets 3aquestionnaires 3arabbits 3asurveys 3avision 3avision disorders 0adog 0ahearing or vision impaired 0aC-BARQ 0abehavior 0atrainability1 aQuick, Amanda1 aHarper, Kelsey1 aSchmidt, Kirsten1 aCampbell, Daniel0 tJournal of veterinary behavior.g2014 Nov.,  Dec., v. 9, no. 6 p.316-323dElsevier Inc.wJournal:J000000117x1558-78787nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jveb.2014.07.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02666naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002800139245010700167300001800274500002000292520138000312592002801692650002101720650000801741650001701749650002001766650001301786650002001799650003001819650001101849650001401860650002101874650003301895650001101928650001001939700002001949700003301969700002002002700001602022773011202038856007302150852000902223655001202232IND60571550320221119082349.0170712e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057155032DNAL7 a10.1111/pce.128402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTorres‐Ruiz, José M.10aDirect observation and modelling of embolism spread between xylem conduits: a case study in Scots pine  ap. 2774-2785.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aXylem embolism is one of the main processes involved in drought‐related plant mortality. Although its consequences for plant physiology are already well described, embolism formation and spread are poorly evaluated and modelled, especially for tracheid‐based species. The aim of this study was to assess the embolism formation and spread in Pinus sylvestris as a case study using X‐ray microtomography and hydraulics methods. We also evaluated the potential effects of cavitation fatigue on vulnerability to embolism and the micro‐morphology of the bordered pits using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to test for possible links between xylem anatomy and embolism spread. Finally, a novel model was developed to simulate the spread of embolism in a 2D anisotropic cellular structure. Results showed a large variability in the formation and spread of embolism within a ring despite no differences being observed in intertracheid pit membrane anatomical traits. Simulations from the model showed a highly anisotropic tracheid‐to‐tracheid embolism spreading pattern, which confirms the major role of tracheid‐to‐tracheid air seeding to explain how embolism spreads in Scots pine. The results also showed that prior embolism removal from the samples reduced the resistance to embolism of the xylem and could result in overestimates of vulnerability to embolism.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus sylvestris 3aair 3acase studies 3acell structures 3aembolism 3afluid mechanics 3amicro-computed tomography 3amodels 3amortality 3aplant physiology 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asowing 3axylem1 aCochard, Hervé1 aMencuccini, M.,q(Maurizio),1 aDelzon, Sylvain1 aBadel, Eric0 tPlant, cell and environment.g2016 Dec., v. 39, no. 12 p.2774-2785dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0140-77917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/pce.128403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01890naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245018600160300001200346500002200358520072900380592002801109650003101137650002201168650001501190650001101205650001501216650001301231700002001244700002201264700003001286700002701316773011401343856007401457852000901531655001201540IND60642837320221118042334.0190508e200412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064283732DNAL7 a10.1007/BF027121162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNamboori, Seema10aErratum to: Enhanced functional and structural domain assignments using remote similarity detection procedures for proteins encoded in the genome of Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv  ap. 445.  aPublished Erratum  aThe three-dimensional structure and subcellular localization of various domains and sub-domains of Rv1318c, a putative cyclase from Mycobacterium tubercolosis, are currently unknown from experimental studies. We have predicted that Rv1318c consists of five transmembrane helices (Namboori et al 2004). However, depending upon the algorithm for prediction and the parameters used, the predicted number of helices can vary. We have also suggested that the C-terminal cyclase domain of Rv1318c is located intracellularly; this is a conserved feature in the family of adenylyl/guanylyl cyclases. Recently it has been shown experimentally that Rv1318c is an adenylyl cyclase (Linder et al 2004; Eur. J.

Development of a relevant MCDA-method requires consideration of a number of key issues, e.g. (a) definition of assessment boundaries, (b) definition of performance scales, both temporal and spatial, (c) selection of relevant criteria (indicators) that facilitate a comprehensive sustainability assessment while avoiding double-counting of effects, and (d) handling of uncertainties. Adding to the complexity is the typically wide variety of inputs, including quantifications based on existing data, expert judgements, and opinions expressed in interviews. The SCORE (Sustainable Choice Of REmediation) MCDA-method was developed to provide a transparent assessment of the sustainability of possible remediation alternatives for contaminated sites relative to a reference alternative, considering key criteria in the economic, environmental, and social sustainability domains. The criteria were identified based on literature studies, interviews and focus-group meetings. SCORE combines a linear additive model to rank the alternatives with a non-compensatory approach to identify alternatives regarded as non-sustainable. The key strengths of the SCORE method are as follows: a framework that at its core is designed to be flexible and transparent; the possibility to integrate both quantitative and qualitative estimations on criteria; its ability, unlike other sustainability assessment tools used in industry and academia, to allow for the alteration of boundary conditions where necessary; the inclusion of a full uncertainty analysis of the results, using Monte Carlo simulation; and a structure that allows preferences and opinions of involved stakeholders to be openly integrated into the analysis. A major insight from practical application of SCORE is that its most important contribution may be that it initiates a process where criteria otherwise likely ignored are addressed and openly discussed between stakeholders.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMonte Carlo method 3aattitudes and opinions 3aindustry 3ainterviews 3amodels 3amulti-criteria decision making 3aremediation 3asocial sustainability 3astakeholders 3auncertainty 3auncertainty analysis 0aSustainable remediation 0aContaminated sites 0aMulti-criteria decision analysis 0aUncertainty analysis 0aSocial sustainability 0aCost–benefit analysis1 aBack, Pär-Erik1 aSöderqvist, Tore,1 aNorrman, Jenny1 aBrinkhoff, Petra1 aNorbert, Tommy,1 aVolchko, Yevheniya1 aNorin, Malin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0257-75621 aBergknut, Magnus1 aDöberl, Gernot0 tScience of the total environment.g2015 Apr. 01, v. 511 p.621-638dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2014.12.0583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02798naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245008100168300001800249520166800267592002801935650002901963650002601992650001102018650001402029650002502043650002602068650002002094650000902114650001502123650002102138650000902159651001802168700002002186700002102206700002902227773008702256856004802343852000902391655001202400IND50059372620221120063932.0140131e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5005937262DNAL7 a10.1007/s10021-012-9564-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarantal, Sandra10aNutrient and Carbon Limitation on Decomposition in an Amazonian Moist Forest  ap. 1039-1052.  aTropical forests determine global biogeochemical cycles to a large extent, but control factors for key ecosystem processes such as decomposition remain poorly understood. With a full-factorial C (cellulose), N (urea), and P (phosphate) fertilization experiment, we tested the relative importance of C and nutrient limitation on litter decomposition in a mature lowland moist forest of French Guiana. Despite the previously demonstrated litter C quality control over decomposition and the very low soil P content (0.1 mg g−1 of soil) at our study site, fertilization with C or P alone did not increase the decomposition of a wide range of litter types (N:P ratios between 20 and 80). Nitrogen fertilization alone also had no effect on decomposition. However, the combined fertilization with N and P resulted in up to 33.5% more initial litter mass lost, with an increasing effect with wider litter N:P ratios. Soil fauna strongly stimulated litter mass loss and enhanced nutrient fertilization effects. Moreover, nutrient effects on decomposition increased with additional C fertilization in the presence of fauna. Our results suggest that increased N availability is required for a positive P effect on decomposition in the studied P-poor tropical forest. Further stimulation of decomposition by C amendment through priming indicates energy limitation of decomposers that is co-determined by nutrient availability. The demonstrated intricate control of the key resources C, N, and P on decomposition calls for an intensified research effort on multiple resource limitation on key processes in tropical forests and how they change under multiple human impacts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropogenic activities 3abiogeochemical cycles 3acarbon 3acellulose 3anitrogen fertilizers 3anutrient availability 3aquality control 3asoil 3asoil fauna 3atropical forests 3aurea 3aFrench Guiana1 aSchimann, Heidy1 aFromin, Nathalie1 aHättenschwiler, Stephan0 tEcosystems.g2012 Nov., v. 15, no. 7 p.1039-1052dSpringer-Verlagx1432-98407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10021-012-9564-9  aDNAL 7aarticle01579naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245006800165300001600233520066000249592002800909650002000937650001800957650001800975650001100993700001901004700001601023700001801039773013001057856008101187852000901268655001201277IND60584597920221118032153.0171026e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058459792DNAL7 a10.1007/s10666-017-9552-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Guofeng10aBlockwise AICc for Model Selection in Generalized Linear Models  ap. 523-533.  aThe corrected Akaike information criterion (AICc) is a widely used tool in analyzing environmental and ecological data, and it outperforms the Akaike information criterion (AIC), especially in small-size samples.

Compared with some other information criteria, extensive simulation results show that the bAICc performs well.

Redds in the Upper WDA River System (North Poland)  ap. 119-134.  aObservations of lake trout, Salmo trutta m. lacustris L., spawning, including recording redd parameters, were conducted in the 2003-2004 to the 2007-2008 seasons at spawning grounds located in the upper Wda River system. Spawning was noted from mid October to early January at a temperature range of 1.1-10.8°C, but primarily within the 3.0-8.0°C range. Redds were measured following spawning in selected segments of the spawning grounds. The parameters measured were as follows: tailspill size, pot depth, water depth near the tailspill, water velocity above the tailspill. Substrate samples were taken from some of the redds in spring to determine particle size distribution. In total, 51 redds were measured, and substrate samples were collected from fifteen of them. The tailspill length ranged from 40-150 cm, and water depth was from 15 to 55 cm. The geometric mean diameter of the substrate (Dg) ranged from 3.0-17.4 mm, and the sand content (fraction < 1 mm) was from 3.0-36.5%. Water velocity above the redds ranged from 40 to 120 cm s⁻¹, and this differed significantly statistically among the streams investigated; the lowest rates were noted in the upper reaches of the system (Pilica). Furthermore, in this part of the system the mean geometrical diameter of the substrate was twofold smaller and the share of sand twofold higher than in the lower part of the river system. The size of the tailspills was positively correlated with female size, pot depth, and water velocity. In practical terms, it can be generalized that female length corresponded to approximately 55% of the tailspill diameter.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalmo trutta 3aSalvelinus namaycush 3acorrelation 3afemales 3ageometry 3aparticle size distribution 3arivers 3asand 3asand fraction 3aspawning 3aspring 3astreams 3atemperature 3aPoland 0aSalmo Trutta 0aSpawning Redds 0aSubstrate Structure 0aRedd Dimensions0 tArchiwum rybactwa polskiego =.g2008 Dec. 30, v. 16, no. 2 p.119-134dVersitax2083-61397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/s10086-008-0010-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02539naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245010800167300001400275520123600289592002801525650004401553650001401597650001601611650001501627650004101642650001301683650001101696650001301707650001401720650001601734650002101750650001601771653001901787653001301806653001101819653001301830653000901843653000901852653000901861700001301870773010701883856008201990852000902072655001202081IND60565746320221117065718.0170626e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056574632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jaap.2016.03.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNair, Vaishakh10aProduction of guaiacols via catalytic fast pyrolysis of alkali lignin using titania, zirconia and ceria  ap. 31-39.  aThe present study is focused on unlocking value added phenolics such as guaiacol and its derivatives from alkali lignin via in situ catalytic fast pyrolysis using TiO2, CeO2 and ZrO2. TiO2 was synthesized by sol-gel technique and calcined at different temperatures, and CeO2 and ZrO2 were synthesized using combustion synthesis protocol. The catalysts were characterized using powder X-ray diffraction, pore size distribution and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Fast pyrolysis of physical mixtures of lignin and the catalysts were conducted in a micropyrolyzer and the products were analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Seventeen phenolic compounds were quantified using pure standards. Guaiacol, methyl guaiacol, ethyl guaiacol, vinyl guaiacol and isoeugenol were the major phenolics produced at 500°C during catalytic fast pyrolysis. The yield of guaiacols with different catalysts followed the trend: sol-gel TiO2 (36–37wt.%)>ZrO2≈CeO2 (∼29wt.%)>Aeroxide TiO2 (26wt.%)>non-catalytic (18wt.%). The high selectivity of TiO2 to guaiacols is attributed to multiple interdependent properties such as presence of surface hydroxyl groups, favourable pore size distribution and crystalline phase.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3acatalysts 3aceric oxide 3acombustion 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3aguaiacol 3alignin 3aporosity 3apyrolysis 3atemperature 3atitanium dioxide 3avalue added 0aFast pyrolysis 0aCatalyst 0aLignin 0aGuaiacol 0aTiO2 0aCeO2 0aZrO21 aVinu, R.0 tJournal of analytical and applied pyrolysis.g2016 May, v. 119 p.31-39dElsevier B.V.x0165-23707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaap.2016.03.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02083naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003100147245008900178300001600267520103000283592002801313650001101341650001401352650001601366650000901382650001401391650001201405650000901417650001001426653001201436653001401448653000901462653002201471700002701493773009901520856008101619852000901700655001201709IND60480329620221119103219.0160127e20081230xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048032962DNAL7 a10.2478/s10086-008-0011-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCzerniejewski, Przemysław10aFecundity Of Vendace, Coregonus Albula (L.), From Several Lakes In Western Pomerania  ap. 135-146.  aThe aim of the study was to determine individual absolute and relative fecundity in vendace, Coregonus albula (L.), populations from four Western Pomeranian lakes that differ morphometrically and trophically.

A high, statistically significant correlation between absolute fecundity and total fish length and a slightly lower correlation between absolute fecundity and fish age were noted in all of the populations studied.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlbula 3aCoregonus 3abody weight 3aeggs 3afecundity 3afemales 3afish 3alakes 0aVendace 0aFecundity 0aLake 0aWestern Pomerania1 aWawrzyniak, Wawrzyniec0 tArchiwum rybactwa polskiego =.g2008 Dec. 30, v. 16, no. 2 p.135-146dVersitax2083-61397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/s10086-008-0011-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02792naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120100001700138245010900155300001600264500001900280520135900299592002801658650001501686650001301701650002001714650001101734650001401745650001601759650001201775650002701787650001601814650001301830650001301843650001401856650002401870650000901894650003201903650001301935650001701948650001701965650001001982651001001992700001302002700001602015700001402031700001602045700001702061700001602078773010602094856004102200852000902241655001202250IND6036793420221120162022.0210616e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND603679342DNAL7 a10.1093/pcp/pcs0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Xiuxia10aDrought-Induced Root Aerenchyma Formation Restricts Water Uptake in Rice Seedlings Supplied with Nitrate  ap. 495-504.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPrevious studies demonstrated that ammonium nutrition results in higher water uptake rate than does nitrate nutrition under water stress, and thus enhances the tolerance of rice plants to water stress. However, the process by which water uptake is related to nitrogen form under water stress remains unknown. A hydroponic experiment with simulated water stress induced by polyethylene glycol (PEG6000) was conducted in a greenhouse to study the relationship between root aerenchyma formation and water uptake rate, such as xylem sap flow rate and hydraulic conductance, in two different rice cultivars (cv. ‘Shanyou 63’ hybrid indica and cv. ‘Yangdao 6’ indica, China). The results showed that root aerenchyma tissue increased in water-stressed plants of both cultivars fed by nitrate. No significant difference was found in root hydraulic conductivity and/or xylem sap flow rate between the two rice cultivars fed by ammonium regardless of water status, whereas these parameters decreased significantly in water-stressed plants fed by nitrate. It was concluded that aerenchyma that formed in the root cortex impeded the radial transport of water in the root cylinder and decreased water uptake in water-stressed rice plants fed by nitrate. Water transport occurred mainly through Hg-sensitive water channels in rice roots supplied with ammonium.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerenchyma 3aammonium 3acell physiology 3acortex 3acultivars 3agreenhouses 3ahybrids 3ahydraulic conductivity 3ahydroponics 3anitrates 3anitrogen 3anutrition 3apolyethylene glycol 3arice 3aroot hydraulic conductivity 3asap flow 3awater stress 3awater uptake 3axylem 3aChina1 aLi, Yong1 aRen, Binbin1 aDing, Lei1 aGao, Cuimin1 aShen, Qirong1 aGuo, Shiwei0 tPlant & cell physiology.g2012 Mar., v. 53, no. 3 p.495-504dOxford University Pressx0032-07817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/pcp/pcs003  aDNAL 7aarticle02481naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002100166245013400187300001600321500001500337520135700352592002801709650000901737650001501746650001701761650001001778650002201788650002001810651001301830651001401843651001401857651001301871653001501884700002201899773008401921856008102005852000902086655001202095IND60081849720221118055926.0141014e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008184972DNAL7 a252140202pmid7 a10.1007/s10709-014-9785-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShreve, Scott M.10aPopulation genetics of bisexual and unisexual populations of the scaly-winged bark louse Echmepteryx hageni (Insecta: Psocoptera)  ap. 405-418.  a2019-12-06  aThe scaly-winged bark louse, Echmepteryx hageni, exhibits a unique pattern of co-existence of apparently differnt reproductive modes. Unisexuality is widespread in eastern North America, while sexual populations are restricted to isolated rock out-croppings in southern Illinois and eastern Kentucky. Three of the four nuclear loci examined show greater genetic diversity in the unisexual form compared to the sexual form of E. hageni, in accordance with the pattern previously shown in mitochondrial genetic data. Neutrality tests of the nuclear loci indicate a consistent signal of demographic expansion in asexual populations, but not in sexual populations. There was evidence of inbreeding in the isolated sexual populations at three of the nuclear loci, and one locus had signs of gene specific balancing selection. However, there is no significant genetic differentiation between bisexual and unisexual populations, possibly due to the greater effective population size of nuclear loci relative to mitochondrial loci. The mitochondrial differentiation of E. hageni populations in the northwestern part of their range (Minnesota and Wisconsin) was also not reflected in the nuclear data. We present three hypotheses that may explain the disparity in observed nuclear and mitochondrial genetic diversity between the reproductive forms of E. hageni.  aPublisher supplied data 3aloci 3ainbreeding 3aunisexuality 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3apopulation size 3aIllinois 3aMinnesota 3aWisconsin 3aKentucky 0aPsocoptera1 aJohnson, Kevin P.0 tGenetica.g2014 Oct., v. 142, no. 5 p.405-418dSpringer-Verlagx0016-67077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10709-014-9785-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02210naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245012900169300001600298520097100314592002801285650002401313650002001337650001201357650001101369650002601380650000901406650001701415650000901432650001401441650000901455653001701464653001201481653000901493653002101502653002001523700002701543700002901570773009901599856008101698852000901779655001201788IND60480329820221119103014.0160127e20081230xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048032982DNAL7 a10.2478/s10086-008-0013-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBochenek, Izabela10aStudies on the Bioavailability of Heavy Metals (Cd, Pb, Cu, Zn) from Bottom Sediments to Guppies, Poecilia Reticulata Peters  ap. 155-166.  aThe experiment was carried out to determine the potential of heavy metals (Cd, Pb, Cu and Zn) passing from bottom sediments to fish and to identify the correlations between concentrations of these metals in bottom sediments and those in fish. The study material consisted of guppies Poecilia reticulata Peters and bottom sediments with known concentrations of the determined metals in particular fractions. As result of the 60-day exposure of the fish to environments with bottom sediments containing various heavy metals loads, an increasing trend was observable for cadmium and lead concentrations in guppies. Comparative analysis showed that the degree of bottom sediment heavy metal contamination influenced concentrations of these in the guppies. It was found that even small changes in environmental conditions affected the release of metals from bottom sediments, which resulted in notable differences in the concentrations of the examined metals in the fish.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPoecilia reticulata 3abioavailability 3acadmium 3acopper 3aenvironmental factors 3afish 3aheavy metals 3alead 3asediments 3azinc 0aHeavy Metals 0aGuppies 0aFish 0aBottom Sediments 0aBioavailability1 aProtasowicki, Mikołaj1 aBrucka-Jastrzębska, Ewa0 tArchiwum rybactwa polskiego =.g2008 Dec. 30, v. 16, no. 2 p.155-166dVersitax2083-61397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/s10086-008-0013-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02806naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245011500155300001600270500002000286520149000306592002801796650001601824650001101840650001501851650001301866650001601879650001501895650001901910650001701929650001701946650001401963700001601977700001501993700001202008700001502020700001802035700001902053700001602072700002702088700001302115700001702128773010902145856007302254852000902327655001202336IND60571550920221119081721.0170712e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057155092DNAL7 a10.1111/pce.128542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Ying10aClathrin regulates blue light‐triggered lateral auxin distribution and hypocotyl phototropism in Arabidopsis  ap. 165-176.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aPhototropism is the process by which plants grow towards light in order to maximize the capture of light for photosynthesis, which is particularly important for germinating seedlings. In Arabidopsis, hypocotyl phototropism is predominantly triggered by blue light (BL), which has a profound effect on the establishment of asymmetric auxin distribution, essential for hypocotyl phototropism. Two auxin efflux transporters ATP‐binding cassette B19 (ABCB19) and PIN‐formed 3 (PIN3) are known to mediate the effect of BL on auxin distribution in the hypocotyl, but the details for how BL triggers PIN3 lateralization remain poorly understood. Here, we report a critical role for clathrin in BL‐triggered, PIN3‐mediated asymmetric auxin distribution in hypocotyl phototropism. We show that unilateral BL induces relocalization of clathrin in the hypocotyl. Loss of clathrin light chain 2 (CLC2) and CLC3 affects endocytosis and lateral distribution of PIN3 thereby impairing BL‐triggered establishment of asymmetric auxin distribution and consequently, phototropic bending. Conversely, auxin efflux inhibitors N‐1‐naphthylphthalamic acid and 2,3,5‐triiodobenzoic acid affect BL‐induced relocalization of clathrin, endocytosis and lateralization of PIN3 as well as asymmetric distribution of auxin. These results together demonstrate an important interplay between auxin and clathrin function that dynamically regulates BL‐triggered hypocotyl phototropism in Arabidopsis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3aauxins 3ablue light 3aclathrin 3aendocytosis 3ahypocotyls 3aphotosynthesis 3aphototropism 3aplant growth 3aseedlings1 aYu, QinQin,1 aJiang, Nan1 aYan, Xu1 aWang, Chao1 aWang, Qingmei1 aLiu, Jianzhong1 aZhu, Muyuan1 aBednarek, Sebastian Y.1 aXu, Jian1 aPan, Jianwei0 tPlant, cell and environment.g2017 Jan., v. 40, no. 1 p.165-176dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0140-77917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/pce.128543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03202naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245013700156300001800293500002000311520144000331592002801771650002401799650001601823650003001839650001201869650001201881650001601893650002701909650002101936650001501957650002501972650001301997650001402010650001902024650000702043650001502050650003302065700002002098700002302118700002102141700002102162700002102183700002102204700001902225700002302244700002502267700002602292700002602318700002402344700002502368773014902393856007302542852000902615655001202624IND60592806920221122085508.0180413e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059280692DNAL7 a10.1002/jctb.54872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaha, Amrita10aSimultaneous sequestration of nitrate and phosphate from wastewater using a tailor‐made bacterial consortium in biofilm bioreactor  ap. 1279-1289.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: Municipal wastewater usually contains nitrate and phosphate as major contaminants, and if discharged untreated affects the health of the environment and human population. Currently available treatment technologies to treat municipal wastewater lose the essential growth nutrients ‘P’ and ‘N’ during treatment. This paper presents a strategy of simultaneous sequestration of nitrate and phosphate in biomass, by using a tailor‐made consortium in a biofilm reactor. RESULTS: The consortium comprising of three novel Bacillus strains in a fixed bed biofilm bioreactor maintained at ambient temperature showed reduction up to 94% of nitrate, 68% of phosphate, 93% of chemical oxygen demand, 97% of biochemical oxygen demand, 73% in total organic carbon while maintaining an effluent pH of 6.8 ± 0.02. Response surface methodology revealed maximum reduction at a flow rate of 1.97 L h‐¹ with 306.04 mg L‐¹ and 19.62 mg L‐¹ of initial nitrate and phosphate concentrations respectively. The system was scaled up from 4.5 L to 220 L with the same retention time of 2 h and operated with consistent performance for over 212 days. CONCLUSION: The treated wastewater met the criterion for reuse as non‐potable water for applications like irrigation and aquaculture, hence making it the fastest microbial process for simultaneous nitrate and phosphate removal from wastewater. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3aaquaculture 3abiochemical oxygen demand 3abiofilm 3abiomass 3abioreactors 3achemical oxygen demand 3ahuman population 3airrigation 3amunicipal wastewater 3anitrates 3anutrients 3aorganic carbon 3apH 3aphosphates 3aresponse surface methodology1 aBhushan, Shashi1 aMukherjee, Pallavi1 aChanda, Chaitali1 aBhaumik, Moumita1 aGhosh, Madhurima1 aSharmin, Jaweria1 aDatta, Poulami1 aBanerjee, Srimoyee1 aBarat, Parthasarathi1 aThakur, Ashoke Ranjan1 aGantayet, Lalit Mohan1 aMukherjee, Indranil1 aRay Chaudhuri, Shaon0 tJournal of chemical technology and biotechnology.g2018 May, v. 93, no. 5 p.1279-1289dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl39259x0268-25757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jctb.54873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02544naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100007800148245007100226300001600297520132200313592002801635650002101663650000901684650002301693650001501716650001101731650001901742650001801761650000901779650001801788650000901806651001101815653002601826653002101852653002101873700003101894773012901925856008302054852000902137655001202146IND60533763620221118221940.0190412e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053376362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jveb.2014.08.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGonzález Ramírez, Mónica Teresa1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9058-962610aBenefits of dog ownership: Comparative study of equivalent samples  ap. 311-315.  aOwing to the inconclusive findings of research regarding the health benefits of pet ownership, we compared perceived health, stress, life satisfaction, happiness, and psychosomatic symptoms in dog owners and non–dog owners. As an attempt to overcome some earlier methodological issues, the sample consisted of 602 individuals from Mexico aged ≥18 years (377 dog owners and 225 non–dog owners). These 2 groups were equivalent in age, gender, educational level, marital status, employment, parental status, and the presence of chronic illness. The results indicated that, compared to non–dog owners, the dog owners' scores were significantly lower for psychosomatic symptoms and stress and were higher for general health, vitality, emotional role, absence of bodily pain, social functioning, and mental health. No significant difference between groups was found for life satisfaction, happiness, physical functioning, or physical role. Group differences might occur because individuals who perceive themselves to be healthier also choose to have a pet; nevertheless, 273 (72.6%) had owned a pet during the previous 5 years, and 86 (22.8% of the overall sample) reported that they had always owned dogs. In conclusion, the dog owners perceived themselves as healthier—but not happier—than non–dog owners.  aPublisher supplied data 3achronic diseases 3adogs 3aeducational status 3aemployment 3agender 3amarital status 3amental health 3apain 3apet ownership 3apets 3aMexico 0ahuman-dog interaction 0aperceived health 0aperceived stress1 aLandero Hernández, René,0 tJournal of veterinary behavior.g2014 Nov.,  Dec., v. 9, no. 6 p.311-315dElsevier Inc.wJournal:J000000117x1558-78787nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jveb.2014.08.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03321naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094024002200128024001900150040001800169100002700187245012300214300001200337500001500349506007600364520161900440592002802059506003702087650002802124650003002152650000902182650001402191650002602205650002802231650001002259650002702269650002202296650002302318650002102341650001302362650002202375650002002397650002602417653001002443700002002453700002102473700001802494700001902512700001802531700001802549700002002567773009102587856008002678852000902758655001202767IND60555751320221207050156.0161029e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055575132DNAL7 a10.1186/1471-2229-13-2302doi7 aPMC39234412pmcid7 a243774982pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJayatilake, Dimanthi V10aGenetic mapping and marker development for resistance of wheat against the root lesion nematode Pratylenchus neglectus  ap. 230.  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: The Rlnn1 locus, which resides on chromosome 7A of bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) confers moderate resistance against the root lesion nematode Pratylenchus neglectus. Prior to this research, the exact linkage relationships of Rlnn1 with other loci on chromosome 7A were not clear and there were no simple codominant markers available for selection of Rlnn1 in wheat breeding. The objectives of the research reported here were to (1) develop an improved genetic map of the Rlnn1 region of chromosome 7A and (2) develop molecular markers that could be used in marker-assisted selection to improve resistance of wheat against P. neglectus. RESULTS: A large-effect quantitative trait locus (QTL) for resistance against P. neglectus was genetically mapped using a population of Excalibur/Kukri doubled haploid lines. This QTL coincides in position with the rust resistance gene(s) Lr20/Sr15, the phytoene synthase gene Psy-A1 and 10 molecular markers, including five new markers designed using wheat-rice comparative genomics and wheat expressed sequence tags. Two of the new markers are suitable for use as molecular diagnostic tools to distinguish plants that carry Rlnn1 and Lr20/Sr15 from those that do not carry these resistance genes. CONCLUSIONS: The genomic location of Rlnn1 was confirmed to be in the terminal region of the long arm of chromosome 7A. Molecular markers were developed that provide simple alternatives to costly phenotypic assessment of resistance against P. neglectus in wheat breeding. In Excalibur, genetic recombination seems to be completely suppressed in the Rlnn1 region.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aquantitative trait loci 3amarker-assisted selection 3aloci 3aphenotype 3aroot lesion nematodes 3aexpressed sequence tags 3awheat 3aPratylenchus neglectus 3aTriticum aestivum 3achromosome mapping 3adoubled haploids 3agenomics 3aphytoene synthase 3agenetic markers 3agenetic recombination 0agenes1 aTucker, Elise J1 aBariana, Harbans1 aKuchel, Haydn1 aEdwards, James1 aMcKay, Alan C1 aChalmers, Ken1 aMather, Diane E0 tBMC plant biology.g2013 Dec., v. 13, no. 1 p.230-230dBioMed Centralx1471-22297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1471-2229-13-2303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01929naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002200166245011700188300001600305520091000321592002801231650001501259650001401274650001101288650002501299650001201324700003001336700003001366700003301396773008401429856008101513852000901594655001201603IND60081850220221120202515.0141014e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008185022DNAL7 a252237512pmid7 a10.1007/s10709-014-9791-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCordeiro, Juliana10aChromosomal evolution in the Drosophila cardini group (Diptera: Drosophilidae): photomaps and inversion analysis  ap. 461-472.  aDetailed chromosome photomaps are the first step to develop further chromosomal analysis to study the evolution of the genetic architecture in any set of species, considering that chromosomal rearrangements, such as inversions, are common features of genome evolution. In this report, we analyzed inversion polymorphisms in 25 different populations belonging to six neotropical species in the cardini group: Drosophila cardini, D. cardinoides, D. neocardini, D. neomorpha, D. parthenogenetica and D. polymorpha. Furthermore, we present the first reference photomaps for the Neotropical D. cardini and D. parthenogenetica and improved photomaps for D. cardinoides, D. neocardini and D. polymorpha. We found 19 new inversions for these species. An exhaustive pairwise comparison of the polytene chromosomes was conducted for the six species in order to understand evolutionary patterns of their chromosomes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDrosophila 3aevolution 3agenome 3apolytene chromosomes 3atropics1 aDe Toni, Daniela Cristina1 ade Souza da Silva, Gisele1 ada Silva Valente, Vera Lucia0 tGenetica.g2014 Oct., v. 142, no. 5 p.461-472dSpringer-Verlagx0016-67077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10709-014-9791-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01440naa a2200265 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100002200154245005200176300001600228520060300244592002800847650001600875650002000891650001400911650001600925651001400941773014100955856005701096852000901153655001201162IND4480350920221120060220.0120418e198312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448035092DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1467-8489.1983.tb00427.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWright, Victor E.10aSome bounds to the relevance of decision theory  ap. 221-230.  aDecision theory affords a means for the objectively rational use of information in decision‐making.

METHODS: We undertook a literature review concerning the roles and the importance of stakeholders in participatory processes, and the use of such processes in environmental and social LCAs (Biswas et al. Int J Life Cycle Assess 3(4):184-190, 1998; Sonnemann et al. Int J Life Cycle Assess 6(6):325-333, 2001; Baldo Int J Life Cycle Assess 7(5):269-275, 2002; James et al. Int J Life Cycle Assess 7(3):151-157, 2002; Bras-Kapwijk Int J Life Cycle Assess 8(5):266-272, 2003; Mettier et al. Int J Life Cycle Assess 11(6):468-476, 2006). As part of the French National Research Agency Piscenlit project, we adapted the Principle, Criteria, Indicator (PCI) method (Rey-Valette et al. 2008), which is an assessment method of sustainable development, as a way to integrate the participatory approach into Social Life Cycle Assessment (SLCA) methodology, mainly at the impact definition stage. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Different views of participation were found in the literature; there is no consensual normative approach for the implication of stakeholders in LCA development. Some attempts have been made to integrate stakeholders into environmental LCAs but these attempts have not been generalized. However, they strongly emphasize the interrelationship between research on the growing integration of stakeholders and on the choice of stakeholders. We then propose criteria from stakeholder theory (Freeman 1984; Mitchell et al. Acad Manage Rev 22(4):853-886, 1997; Geibler et al. Bus Strat Environ 15:334-346, 2006) in order to identify relevant stakeholders for SLCA participatory approach. The adaptation of the PCI method to Principles, Impacts, and Indicators (PII) enables stakeholders to express themselves and hence leads to definitions of relevant social indicators that they can appropriate. The paper presents results regarding the selection of stakeholders but no specific results regarding the choice of impact categories and indicators. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS: Integrating a participatory approach into SLCAs is of interest at several levels. It enables various factors to be taken into account: plurality of stakeholder interests, local knowledge, and impact categories that make sense for stakeholders in different contexts. It also promotes dialogue and simplifies the search for indicators. However, it requires a multidisciplinary approach and the integration of new knowledge and skills for the SLCA practitioners.  aPublisher supplied data 3alife cycle assessment 3asocial environment 3astakeholders 3asustainable development0 tinternational journal of life cycle assessment.g2014 Aug., v. 19, no. 8 p.1506-1514dSpringer-Verlagx0948-33497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11367-014-0758-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01963naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002500140245010700165300001600272500001100288520098200299592002801281650002401309650001401333650001501347650003101362650002401393650001201417700002301429773011401452856007401566852000901640655001201649IND60642838220221118042241.0190508e200503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064283822DNAL7 a10.1007/BF027037092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChowdhury, Debashish10aEvolutionary ecologyin silico: Does mathematical modelling help in understanding ‘generic’ trends?  ap. 277-287.  aReview  aMotivated by the results of recent laboratory experiments, as well as many earlier field observations, that evolutionary changes can take place in ecosystems over relatively short ecological time scales, several ‘unified’ mathematical models of evolutionary ecology have been developed over the last few years with the aim of describing the statistical properties of data related to the evolution of ecosystems. Moreover, because of the availability of sufficiently fast computers, it has become possible to carry out detailed computer simulations of these models. For the sake of completeness and to put these recent developments in perspective, we begin with a brief summary of some older models of ecological phenomena and evolutionary processes. However, the main aim of this article is to review critically these ‘unified’ models, particularly those published in the physics literature, in simple language that makes the new theories accessible to a wider audience  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputer simulation 3acomputers 3aecosystems 3alaboratory experimentation 3amathematical models 3aphysics1 aStauffer, Dietrich0 tJournal of biosciences.g2005 Mar., v. 30, no. 2 p.277-287dSpringer IndiawJournal:jnl31976x0250-59917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF027037093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02919naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094024002200128024001900150040001800169100001900187245014500206300001200351506007600363520151300439592002801952506003701980650001402017650000802031650002202039650001602061650001402077650002602091650001902117650001502136650002102151650001102172650001602183700002002199700003102219700002102250700002202271773009102293856008002384852000902464655001202473IND60555751520221207045614.0161029e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055575152DNAL7 a10.1186/1471-2229-13-2192doi7 aPMC39300652pmcid7 a243544672pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDyer, Robert J10aGenome size expansion and the relationship between nuclear DNA content and spore size in the Asplenium monanthes fern complex (Aspleniaceae)  ap. 219.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Homosporous ferns are distinctive amongst the land plant lineages for their high chromosome numbers and enigmatic genomes. Genome size measurements are an under exploited tool in homosporous ferns and show great potential to provide an overview of the mechanisms that define genome evolution in these ferns. The aim of this study is to investigate the evolution of genome size and the relationship between genome size and spore size within the apomictic Asplenium monanthes fern complex and related lineages. RESULTS: Comparative analyses to test for a relationship between spore size and genome size show that they are not correlated. The data do however provide evidence for marked genome size variation between species in this group. These results indicate that Asplenium monanthes has undergone a two-fold expansion in genome size. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings challenge the widely held assumption that spore size can be used to infer ploidy levels within apomictic fern complexes. We argue that the observed genome size variation is likely to have arisen via increases in both chromosome number due to polyploidy and chromosome size due to amplification of repetitive DNA (e.g. transposable elements, especially retrotransposons). However, to date the latter has not been considered to be an important process of genome evolution within homosporous ferns. We infer that genome evolution, at least in some homosporous fern lineages, is a more dynamic process than existing studies would suggest.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAsplenium 3aDNA 3achromosome number 3achromosomes 3aevolution 3aferns and fern allies 3anuclear genome 3apolyploidy 3aretrotransposons 3aspores 3atransposons1 aPellicer, Jaume1 aSavolainen, V.q(Vincent),1 aLeitch, Ilia J.,1 aSchneider, Harald0 tBMC plant biology.g2013 Dec., v. 13, no. 1 p.219-219dBioMed Centralx1471-22297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1471-2229-13-2193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02442naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002800148245010000176300001600276520098100292592002801273650004401301650001901345650002001364650004101384650002201425650001301447650001901460650001401479650001401493650001701507650001901524653001401543653001601557653002101573653001601594653001601610700004001626700002401666700003001690700003101720700002101751773010901772856008201881852000901963655001201972IND60565747120221117070114.0170626e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056574712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jaap.2016.03.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aColman, Maristela Denck10aEvolved gas analysis (TG-DSC-FTIR) and (Pyr-GC–MS) in the disposal of medicines (aceclofenac)  ap. 157-161.  aDuring the twentieth century the growth of industrialisation, urbanisation and populations culminated in huge areas of waste disposal worldwide. Consequently, the management of the disposal of medicines (expired or not) is important in order to minimise the possibility of environmental pollution. A sample of aceclofenac (purity=99.77% and m.p.=151.63°C) was analysed by TG-DSC-FTIR in nitrogen atmosphere. The TG-DSC curves showed two main stages of decomposition, with loss of organic matter generating carbonaceous derivatives as final residue. The use of coupled FTIR suggested the loss of CO, CO2 and/or 2-chloro-propanoic acid/2-chloro-butanoic acid. The use of fast pyrolysis (Pyr) coupled with GC–MS suggested that the main compounds that were released were 1-(2,6-dichlorophenyl)-2-indolinone and 2,6-dichloro-N-(2-methylphenyl)–benzenamine. The differences in the results between the techniques were due to the experimental conditions used for each instrument.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon monoxide 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3aindustrialization 3anitrogen 3aorganic matter 3apollution 3apyrolysis 3aurbanization 3awaste disposal 0aPyrolysis 0aAceclofenac 0aThermal analysis 0aTG-DSC-FTIR 0aPyr-GC–MS1 aLazzarotto, Simone Rosa da Silveira1 aLazzarotto, Marcelo1 aHansel, Fabrício Augusto1 aColman, Tiago André Denck1 aSchnitzler, Egon0 tJournal of analytical and applied pyrolysis.g2016 May, v. 119 p.157-161dElsevier B.V.x0165-23707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaap.2016.03.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle00951naa a2200241 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001900152245006200171300001600233520020900249592002800458650001600486650001300502650001400515773010400529856005500633852000900688655001200697IND4478334620221121195124.0120602e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447833462DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1529-8817.2012.01168.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aColeman, A.

However, there are many questions about the economic properties of the oxy-combustion technique. In this paper, a detailed techno-economic evaluation study was performed on three typical power plants (2 Ã 300 MW subcritical, 2 Ã 600 MW supercritical, 2 Ã 1000 MW ultra supercritical), as conventional air fired and oxycombustion options in China, by utilizing the authoritative data published in 2010 for the design of coal-fired power plants. Techno-economic evaluation models were set up and costs of electricity generation, CO2 avoidance costs as well as CO2 capture costs, were calculated. Moreover, the effects of CO2 tax and CO2 sale price on the economic characteristics of oxy-combustion power plants were also considered. Finally, a sensitivity analysis for parameters such as coal sample, coal price, air separation unit price, flue gas treatment unit price, CO2 capture efficiency, as well as the air excess factor was conducted. The results revealed that: (1) because the oxy-combustion technique has advantages in thermal efficiency, desulfurization efficiency and denitration efficiency, oxy-combustion power plants will reach the economic properties of conventional air fired power plants if, (a) the CO2 emission is taxed and the high purity CO2 product can be sold, or (b) there are some policy preferences in financing and coal price for oxy-combustion power plants, or (c) the power consumption and cost of air separation units and flue gas treatment units can be reduced; (2) from subcritical plants to supercritical and finally ultra-supercritical plants, the economics are improving, regardless of whether they are conventional air fired power plants or oxy-combustion power plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3acarbon dioxide 3acoal 3acombustion 3aelectricity 3afunding 3aissues and policy 3amodels 3apower plants 3aprices 3aChina1 aZhao, Haibo,1 aZheng, Chuguang,0 tChinese science bulletin.g2011 Nov., v. 56, no. 31 p.3333-3345dSpringer-Verlagx1001-65387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11434-011-4707-5  aDNAL 7aarticle02383naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245008000172300001400252500001400266520105500280592002801335650001201363650001301375650001601388650002201404650001801426650000701444650001801451650001401469650001201483650001501495650001201510650001601522650001401538650001001552650001901562653002001581653002601601653001401627700002501641700002101666700002401687773009601711856008501807852000901892655001201901IND60724134820221120072643.0210305e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072413482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.powtec.2021.01.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMalta, Juliana O.10aCharacterization and stabilization of nano-metakaolin colloidal suspensions  ap. 43-55.  aNAL-light  aNanometric powders bear significant problems in the efficiency of dispersion. The ideal situation would be to ensure full nanoparticle separation in suspensions or composites matrix, which is hard to achieve due to the high reactivity and aggregation. This study evaluates the conditions to stabilize nano-metakaolin (NMK) in water suspension by analyzing the influence of solute concentration, pH, type and content of dispersants. Potentiometric titration curves, zeta potential and average particle size measurements were performed, along with rheological measurements, at different times: 0 h, 3 h, 6 h and 24 h. NMK particles showed the same tendency of surface charge distribution, regardless of solute concentration. The dispersed NMK particles presented two isoelectric points, attributed to the multiple arrangements they form when in suspension. Polycarboxylate (PC) was the dispersant that provided greater dispersion stability. Regarding the rheological and zeta potential measurements, the suspensions presented stability up to 24 h.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUrsidae 3acolloids 3adispersants 3aisoelectric point 3ananoparticles 3apH 3aparticle size 3aparticles 3apowders 3aseparation 3asolutes 3asuspensions 3atitration 3awater 3azeta potential 0aNano-metakaolin 0aColloidal suspensions 0aStability1 aOliveira, Lucas V.S.1 aUeki, Marcelo M.1 aBarreto, Ledjane S.0 tPowder technology.g2021 May, v. 383 p.43-55dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11732x0032-59107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2021.01.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01380naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245007300170300001600243520031800259592002800577650002300605650001700628650001700645650004400662653004800706653002800754653001500782700001700797700001600814700001800830700001400848773010800862856005100970852000901021655001201030IND50075876720221120041253.0140410e20120401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007587672DNAL7 a10.1080/14786419.2010.5515132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Dong-Juan12aA new ent-kaurane diterpenoid from Rabdosia pseudo-irrorata C.

Larvae were treated in a specific device at a temperature range of 46 to 70°C. Statistical analysis of the data demonstrated that the thermal survival kinetics was best represented by a 2-parameter Weibull model above 50°C. The mortality of larvae only occurs beyond a critical temperature of 41.6°C±2.5°C. A 2D axial-symmetric model of heat transfer (convection, microwave at 915MHz) was developed for cocoa bean and date palm. It was combined with the survival rate of larvae (Weibull model) and some z-values (from literature) are used for calculating a “food quality index” degradation kinetics. The intensive heating/convection process may not be adaptable for food products at low water activity due to high surface product temperatures. The use of microwave heating for date fruits and conventional hot air treatments for cocoa beans is recommended.  aPublisher supplied data 3asurvival rate 3amodels 3afood quality 3aheat transfer 3acocoa beans 3aair 3adried fruit 3adates (fruit) 3alarvae 3aWeibull statistics 3asurface temperature 3aEphestia kuehniella 3awater activity 3aheat treatment 0astatistical analysis1 aMéot, Jean-Michel,1 aCollignan, Antoine1 aBohuon, Philippe0 tFood research international.g2011 Jan., v. 44, no. 1 p.156-166dElsevier Ltdx0963-99697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2010.10.0473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01828naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245007000166300001600236520046900252592002800721650003000749650000800779650001400787650002500801650002800826650001000854650000900864650001800873653001800891653000800909653001600917653001800933653001100951653001400962700001600976700001600992700001901008700002201027700001701049700001601066700005801082700001601140773009601156856008501252852000901337655001201346IND60544342020221119142329.0190415e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054434202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.margen.2014.07.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGomes, A.S.10aTranscriptome of the Atlantic halibut (Hippoglossus hippoglossus)  ap. 101-103.  aAlthough the Atlantic halibut (Hippoglossus hippoglossus) is an important commercial species, there is still a deficit with regard to the number of transcripts in the databases, which can be accessed and exploited for targeted candidate gene and pathway studies.

To fully reveal the effects of dietary ARA on the mRNA profiles of adipose tissue, transcriptome techniques were applied in this study. A 10-weeks feeding experiment was performed using two isonitrogenous and isoenergetic purified diets, namely ARA-free (control) and 0.30% ARA (ARA group). Results showed increased ARA content and decreased intraperitoneal fat index and adipocyte size in the adipose tissue of fish fed ARA (P < 0.05). A total of 611 and 973 genes of the adipose tissue were significantly up-regulated and down-regulated, respectively, in fish fed ARA (P < 0.05). Dietary ARA upregulated LOX pathway but downregulated CYP450 pathway annotated genes expression. A total of 65 cell development annotated genes including 30 adipocyte proliferation, 21 adipocyte differentiation, and 14 cell apoptosis annotated genes were down-regulated in the ARA group. In addition, 19 lipid catabolism annotated genes were increased. The mRNA expression levels of 5 chemokines, 10 cytokines, 26 cytokine and chemokine receptors, 15 cell adhesion, 6 oxidative stress, and 6 angiogenesis annotated genes were all down-regulated in fish fed ARA. Finally, dietary ARA also decreased the expression of transcripts annotated with glucose transportation, glycolysis and gluconeogenesis. Overall, our results demonstrate that dietary ARA has a fat reducing role, and tends to retard adipocyte development and attenuate chronic inflammation based on these adipose transcript expression results in grass carp.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCtenopharyngodon idella 3aadipocytes 3aadipogenesis 3aadipose tissue 3aangiogenesis 3aapoptosis 3aarachidonic acid 3acell adhesion 3achemokine receptors 3achemokines 3adiet 3afarmed fish 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3agluconeogenesis 3aglucose 3aglycolysis 3ainflammation 3ajuveniles 3alipid metabolism 3amessenger RNA 3anutrient transport 3aoxidative stress 3atranscriptome 0aACC 0aARA 0aATGL 0aC/EBP 0aCOX 0aCYP450 0aDEG 0aFABP 0aFAS 0aFPKM 0aHSL 0aIL-6 0aIPF 0aLC-PUFA 0aLOX 0aLPL 0aMUFA 0aNPL 0aPCA 0aPG 0aPL 0aPPAR 0aROS 0aSFA 0aSREBP 0aTG 0aTL 0aTNFα 0aLong chain polyunsaturated fatty acid 0aCtenopharyngodon idella 0aAdipogenesis 0aLow-grade inflammation 0aLipolysis1 aLei, Cai-xia1 aJi, Hong1 aZhou, Ji-shu1 aYu, Hai-bo1 aLi, Yang1 aYu, Er-meng1 aXie, Jun0 tComparative biochemistry and physiology.g2019 June, v. 30 p.122-132dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12415x1744-117X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cbd.2019.02.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04026naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100007200151245017000223520194500393592002802338650001202366650001302378650001202391650001402403650001102417650002502428650001402453650002902467650001302496650001602509650000902525650001402534650001302548650001902561650001402580650001002594650001302604650001302617650001102630650001302641653002402654653003502678653002602713653001702739653001802756700003702774700003602811700002702847700006302874700002602937700002702963700007002990700003103060700006703091700003003158773011803188856008503306852000903391655001203400IND60758399220221123030848.0220124e20220215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075839922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.1141892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarlos dos Santos, Josenilda1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2348-292210aCharacterization of the biofilm structure and microbial diversity of sulfate-reducing bacteria from petroleum produced water supplemented by different carbon sources  aColonization by sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) in environments associated with oil is mainly dependent on the availability of sulfate and carbon sources. The formation of biofilms by SRB increases the corrosion of pipelines and oil storage tanks, representing great occupational and operational risks and respective economic losses for the oil industry. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of the addition of acetate, butyrate, lactate, propionate and oil on the structure of biofilm formed in carbon steel coupons, as well as on the diversity of total bacteria and SRB in the planktonic and sessile communities from petroleum produced water. The biofilm morphology, chemical composition, average roughness and the microbial diversity was analyzed. In all carbon sources, formation of dense biofilm without morphological and/or microbial density differences was detected, with the most of cells observed in the form of individual rods. The diversity and richness indices of bacterial species in the planktonic community was greater than in the biofilm. Geotoga was the most abundant genus, and more than 85% of SRB species were common to all treatments. The functional predicted profile shown that the observed genres in planktonic communities were related to the reduction of sulfate, sulfite, elementary sulfur and other sulfur compounds, but the abundance varied between treatments. For the biofilm, the functions predicted profile for the oil treatment was the one that most varied in relation to the control, while for the planktonic community, the addition of all carbon sources interfered in the predicted functional profile. Thus, although it does not cause changes in the structure and morphology biofilm, the supplementation of produced water with different carbon sources is associated with changes in the SRB taxonomic composition and functional profiles of the biofilm and the planktonic bacterial communities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGeotoga 3aacetates 3abiofilm 3abutyrates 3acarbon 3achemical composition 3acorrosion 3aenvironmental management 3aindustry 3alactic acid 3aoils 3apetroleum 3aplankton 3apropionic acid 3aroughness 3asteel 3asulfates 3asulfites 3asulfur 3ataxonomy 0aElectron microscopy 0aEnergy dispersion spectroscopy 0aFunctional prediction 0aSteel coupon 0a16S rRNA gene1 aLopes, Déborah Romaskevis Gomes1 aSilva, Lívia Carneiro Fidélis1 aRamos, José Luiz Lima1 aDias, Roberto Sousa1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9752-19691 aLima, Helena Santiago1 aSousa, Maíra Paula de1 aWaldow, Vinícius de Abreu1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2348-29221 aPaula, Sérgio Oliveira de1 aFerreira, Sukarno Olavo1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8174-02001 aSilva, Cynthia Canêdo da0 tJournal of environmental management.g2022 Feb. 15, v. 304 p.114189-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.1141893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02655naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245005400171300001600225520164900241592002801890650000801918650001401926650001501940650001401955650001101969650003301980650001702013650001802030650001202048651001202060700001502072773008802087856008602175990002302261852000902284655001202293IND60092007820221118033820.0141103e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009200782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.buildenv.2011.11.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSinnott, Derek10aAir-tightness field data for dwellings in Ireland  ap. 269-275.  aAir-tightness plays a major role in both building energy performance and indoor environmental quality. Ireland’s National Methodology for the calculation of energy performance of buildings, the Building Energy Rating (BER) includes air permeability characteristics. From an international perspective, many air permeability surveys have been carried out. However, there is a paucity of knowledge relating to the existing housing stock in Ireland. This paper reports the air permeability test results of 28 houses built between 1944 and 2008 and at varying stages of retrofit. The results are compared to past studies and compliance with the existing standards. The effect of construction type, age, design details and retrofitting on air permeability is examined. While statistically small the dwellings are broadly representative of the many that will be retrofitted over the coming years. This paper addresses the lack of practical research in air-tightness for new and retrofitted dwellings in Ireland. The results challenge the perception that newer dwellings are more air-tight than older dwellings. The paper highlights design detailing, workmanship and building control deficits for the studied dwellings. The paper concludes that good design combined with high-quality workmanship, and rigorous control throughout construction is critical to ensure the delivery of a good product. The results can be complied with future research to establish a database for Ireland. The study will contribute to future research and facilitate building professionals to make informed decisions about how to achieve air-tightness standards in dwellings.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3abuildings 3acompliance 3adatabases 3aenergy 3aindoor environmental quality 3apermeability 3aprofessionals 3asurveys 3aIreland1 aDyer, Mark0 tBuilding and environment.g2012 May, v. 51 p.269-275dElsevier Ltdx0360-13237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2011.11.0163Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02755naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245012600166520126700292592002801559650002901587650003101616650001801647650001601665650001801681650002901699650001301728650002601741650000701767650001401774650002001788650001101808650001401819650000901833653003101842653001701873653003001890700001901920700001701939700001701956700001701973700005401990700001602044773011802060856008602178852000902264655001202273IND60758399420221123030819.0220118e20220201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075839942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.1141922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Siyu12aA designed moderately thermophilic consortia with a better performance for leaching high grade fine lead-zinc sulfide ore  aUnwieldy fine sulfide ores are produced during mining; without being appropriately disposed of, they can cause environmental pollution and waste resources. This study investigated the leaching performance of a moderately thermophilic consortia (Leptospirillum ferriphilum + Acidithiobacillus caldus + Sulfobacillus benefaciens) for fine lead-zinc sulfide raw ore. The results showed this microbial community created a low pH, high ORP, and high cell concentration environment for mineral leaching, improving bioleaching efficiency. Under the action of this consortia, the zinc leaching rate reached 96.44 in 8 days, and reached 100% after 12 days. EPS analysis indicated that the consortia could mediate the secretion of more polysaccharides to ensure leaching efficiency. EPS levels and amino acids were the main factors affecting bioleaching. An analysis of mineral surface characteristics showed the consortia effectively leached pyrite and sphalerite from the fine sulfide ore, and prevented the mineral surface forming the jarosite that could hinder bioleaching. This study found that bioleaching reduced the potential environmental toxicity of the minerals, providing an important reference for guiding the bioleaching of unwieldy fine sulfide raw ore.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcidithiobacillus caldus 3aLeptospirillum ferriphilum 3aSulfobacillus 3abioleaching 3aecotoxicology 3aenvironmental management 3ajarosite 3amicrobial communities 3apH 3apollution 3apolysaccharides 3apyrite 3asecretion 3azinc 0aFine particle size raw ore 0aEPS fraction 0aSulfobacillus benefaciens1 aLiao, Xiaojian1 aLi, Shoupeng1 aFang, Xiaodi1 aGuan, Zhijie1 aYe, Maoyou1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4148-26351 aSun, Shuiyu0 tJournal of environmental management.g2022 Feb. 01, v. 303 p.114192-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.1141923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04244naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245012300163300001600286520263500302592002802937650002702965650002202992650001303014650001503027650001403042650002503056650001603081650001303097650001303110650001503123650001203138650002403150650001703174650002103191650001103212650001403223650002203237650001503259650002403274653002703298653001003325653001403335653002903349653000803378700001403386700001703400700001503417700001703432700001803449773012003467856008203587852000903669655001203678IND60634254120221120140728.0190516e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063425412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cbd.2019.03.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLv, Zhimeng10aDivergent proteomics response of Apostichopus japonicus suffering from skin ulceration syndrome and pathogen infection  ap. 196-205.  aSkin ulceration syndrome (SUS) of sea cucumber is a common and serious disease that affects the stable development of Apostichopus japonicus in the culture industry. The part of sea cucumber that suffers from major injury and is directly observed is the body wall, in which protein variations should be the most direct evidence of the disease. To understand the response mechanisms of A. japonicus in SUS progression, we investigated protein changes in the body wall of diseased A. japonicus induced by Vibrio splendidus and individuals with natural diseases by isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ). About 119 proteins were identified in the two iTRAQ groups. A comparison of the protein expression profiles among two SUS conditions revealed that the mode of action induced by V. splendidus (Vs-SUS) was completely different from those in individuals with natural disease (ND-SUS). Most of the differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) (33 in 37 DEPs) were significantly depressed in the Vs-SUS group. Only 13 proteins in 27 DEPs showed similar trend to those in the ND-SUS group. Many important proteins involved in major intercellular signaling pathways associated with SUS disease were identified based on the KEGG and GO database search. Many proteins were located in the mitochondria and mainly involved in the oxidative stress pathway. Glutathione metabolism pathway was associated with reactive oxygen (ROS) production in the ND-SUS group. In the Vs-group, most of the proteins were concentrated in the cytoplasm and were related to immunity and extracellular matrix stability. In the ND-SUS group, the activity of key enzymes (CAT, GPx) that eliminate mitochondrial ROS production and structural stable protein (HSP60, HSP10) decreased, whereas those of complement proteins (C3, C3-2) that promoted ROS production was upregulated. This finding supported that oxidative damage caused by ROS might be the main effector for SUS in the ND-SUS group. The challenge with V. splendidus led to the breakdown of the defense capability of sea cucumber and suppressed the expression of immune-related proteins, such as C-type lectin, caspase, STAT, and cystatin. The downregulation of TIMP led to MMP1 overexpression. Members of the MMP family could directly degrade the extracellular matrix, which may be the main reason for the cell matrix degradation and induced SUS disease in the Vs-SUS group. Hence, ROS and extracellular matrix degradation enzymes could play important roles in the formation of SUS in sea cucumber. Results provide insights into the complex molecular mechanism of SUS in sea cucumber.  aPublisher supplied data 3aApostichopus japonicus 3aVibrio splendidus 3acaspases 3acomplement 3adatabases 3aextracellular matrix 3aglutathione 3aimmunity 3aindustry 3aintegument 3alectins 3amechanism of action 3amitochondria 3aoxidative stress 3aoxygen 3apathogens 3aprotein synthesis 3aproteomics 3asignal transduction 0aApostichopus japonicas 0aiTRAQ 0aBody wall 0aSkin ulceration syndrome 0aROS1 aGuo, Ming1 aLi, Chenghua1 aShao, Yina1 aZhao, Xuelin1 aZhang, Weiwei0 tComparative biochemistry and physiology.g2019 June, v. 30 p.196-205dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12415x1744-117X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cbd.2019.03.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04504naa a2200853 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100001500169245009300184300001800277500001500295520175200310592002802062650001602090650002402106650001302130650001702143650001502160650001002175650004402185650001502229650001902244650001502263650002302278650003302301650001302334650004402347650001302391650002502404650001902429650001502448650001502463650001002478650001202488650003102500650006302531650006102594650001102655650002902666650002402695650004002719650003102759650002702790650004402817650005702861650001102918650003602929650000902965650002202974650002602996650002903022650003203051650004003083650004503123650003803168650004503206650004503251650003303296653003403329700001203363700001403375700001403389700001203403700001503415773009203430856008403522990002303606852000903629655001203638IND60087504820221121225541.0141102e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008750482DNAL7 a238719432pmid7 a10.1016/j.actbio.2013.07.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, L.R.10aDirect synthesis of heparin-like poly(ether sulfone) polymer and its blood compatibility  ap. 8851-8863.  a2019-12-06  aIn this study, heparin-like poly(ethersulfone) (HLPES) was synthesized by a combination of polycondensation and post-carboxylation methods, and was characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance hydrogen spectrum and gel permeation chromatography. Owing to the similar backbone structure, the synthesized HLPES could be directly blended with pristine PES at any ratios to prepare PES/HLPES membranes. After the introduction of HLPES, the microscopic structure of the modified PES membranes was changed, while the hydrophilicity was significantly enhanced. Bovine serum albumin and bovine serum fibrinogen adsorption, activated partial thromboplastin time, thromb time and platelet adhesion for the modified PES membranes were investigated. The results indicated that the blood compatibility of the PES/HLPES membranes was significantly improved compared with that of pristine PES membrane. For the PES/HLPES membranes, obvious decreases in platelet activation on PF-4 level, in complement activation on C3a and C5a levels, and in leukocytes activation on CD11b levels were observed compared with those for the pristine PES membrane. The improved blood compatibility of the PES/HLPES membrane might due to the existence of the hydrophilic groups (–SO₃Na, –COONa). Furthermore, the modified PES membranes showed good cytocompatibility. Hepatocytes cultured on the PES/HLPES membranes presented improved growth in terms of SEM observation, MTT assay and confocal laser scanning microscope observation compared with those on the pristine PES membrane. These results indicate that the PES/HLPES membranes present great potential in blood-contact fields such as hemodialysis and bio-artificial liver supports.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahepatocytes 3aplatelet activation 3apolymers 3ahemodialysis 3acomplement 3aliver 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3afibrinogen 3ahydrophilicity 3aleukocytes 3agel chromatography 3ascanning electron microscopy 3aadhesion 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3ahydrogen 3abovine serum albumin 3athromboplastin 3aadsorption 2aAdsorption 2aAdult 2aAnimals 2aCD11b Antigenxmetabolism. 2aBiocompatible Materialsxchemical synthesisxpharmacology. 2aBlood Plateletsxcytologyxdrug effectsxultrastructure. 2aCattle 2aCell Shapexdrug effects 2aChromatography, Gel 2aComplement Activationxdrug effects 2aComplement C3axmetabolism 2aFibrinogenxmetabolism 2aHeparinxchemical synthesisxchemistry. 2aHepatocytesxcytologyxdrug effectsxultrastructure. 2aHumans 2aMagnetic Resonance Spectroscopy 2aMale 2aMaterials Testing 2aMembranes, Artificial 2aMicroscopy, Fluorescence 2aPartial Thromboplastin Time 2aPlatelet Adhesivenessxdrug effects 2aPolymersxchemical synthesisxchemistry. 2aSerum Albumin, Bovinexmetabolism 2aSpectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared 2aSulfonesxchemical synthesisxchemistry. 2aWhole Blood Coagulation Time 0agel permeation chromatography1 aQin, H.1 aNie, S.Q.1 aSun, S.D.1 aRan, F.1 aZhao, C.S.0 tActa biomaterialia.g2013 Nov., v. 9, no. 11 p.8851-8863dElsevier Ltdx1742-70617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actbio.2013.07.0103Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02356naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245010000165300001800265520071200283536011500995592002801110596001201138650002401150650002601174650002501200650001801225650002801243650001701271650001001288650001801298650001001316650001001326650001501336650002401351650000901375650001301384650002601397650002201423653001701445653002001462653001901482700001501501700001401516700001901530700001401549700001701563700001501580773012501595856008501720852000901805655001201814IND60747237920221119011504.0210812e20210803xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074723792DNAL7 a10.1080/14786419.2019.16806682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Bing12aA new benzophenone with biological activities from metabolites of butyrolactone I in rat faeces  ap. 2489-2497.  aButyrolactone I, one of the major secondary metabolites of fungus Aspergillus terreus, is a selective cdc2 kinase inhibitor. In the present study, the metabolism of butyrolactone I in male Wistar rats was investigated by characterising metabolites excreted into faeces. Following an oral dose of 40 mg/kg butyrolactone I, two phase I metabolites were isolated from the faeces of rat. The new structure was identified on the spectroscopic data analysis. The new compound V1 and known compound V2 were tested for their cytotoxicity, antimicrobial and antioxidant activity. V1 and V2 showed significant free radical scavenging ability. V2 also showed strong inhibitory activity against Staphylococcus aureus.  aThis work was supported by Heilongjiang Provincial Higher Education Fund Research Project [grant No. 17XN010].  aPublisher supplied data  a17XN010 3aAspergillus terreus 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aantioxidant activity 3abenzophenones 3acyclin-dependent kinase 3acytotoxicity 3afeces 3afree radicals 3afungi 3amales 3ametabolism 3aoral administration 3arats 3aresearch 3asecondary metabolites 3aspectral analysis 0aBenzophenone 0abutyrolactone I 0arat metabolite1 aChen, Ning1 aXu, Ying,1 aZhang, Jia-Wei1 aSun, Yuan1 aZhao, Li-Zhu1 aJi, Yu-bin0 tNatural product research.g2021 Aug. 3, v. 35, no. 15 p.2489-2497dTaylor & FranciswJournal:J000000126x1478-64277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14786419.2019.16806683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02197naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245016100168300001600329520103400345592002801379650002201407650001801429650001201447650002101459650001701480653001801497653002601515653002901541653002701570700001701597700002101614773011701635856008601752852000901838655001201847IND60788524620221116143100.0220815e20220902xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078852462DNAL7 a10.1080/08941920.2022.20845802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLange, Sarah10aPolicy-Oriented Learning among National Forest Stakeholders in the Pacific Northwest: The Role of Science in Changing Beliefs about Forest Management Policy  ap. 955-972.  aWe evaluate whether national forest stakeholders in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States changed their beliefs about appropriate forest management practices and policies since adoption of the 1994 Northwest Forest Plan, and whether any belief changes were due to new scientific information. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 20 individuals with long-term involvement in national forest policy in the Pacific Northwest. Three coalitions were identified: an amenity coalition, a commodity coalition, and a scientific management coalition. The majority of interviewees stated that they revised some of their policy beliefs, with belief changes varying by coalition. Of those who changed their beliefs, most attributed their belief changes to personal experiences and perceptions. New scientific information played a relatively small role in changing stakeholder beliefs, despite extensive scientific research on the impacts of forest management practices following in the wake of the Northwest Forest Plan.  aPublisher supplied data 3aforest management 3aforest policy 3aforests 3anational forests 3astakeholders 0aBelief change 0aNorthwest Forest Plan 0aforest management policy 0ascientific information1 aRyan, Clare,1 aThomas, Craig W.0 tSociety & natural resources.g2022 Sept. 2, v. 35, no. 9 p.955-972dRoutledgewJournal:jnl45063x1521-07237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08941920.2022.20845803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03129naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245015500174300001200329520186500341592002802206650002202234650002502256650001202281650001302293650002002306650003002326650001302356651001002369653002502379653001602404653002902420653002502449700001902474700001902493700001702512773010902529856008402638852000902722655001202731IND50087038720221119225735.0150325e20130101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008703872DNAL7 a10.1080/07060661.2012.7021282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEl-Bebany, Ahmed F.10aVegetative compatibility of Verticillium dahliae isolates from potato and sunflower using nitrate non-utilizing (nit) mutants and PCR-based approaches  ap. 1-9.  aVegetative compatibility groups (VCGs) of 12 potato and nine sunflower isolates of Verticillium dahliae were determined using both nitrate non-utilizing (nit) mutants and multiplex-nested-PCR approaches. Based on analysis of nit mutants, most potato isolates showed strong compatibility with VCG 4A and weak compatibility with VCG 4B; one potato isolate was also weakly compatible with VCGs 2A, 2B and 3. Sunflower isolates were more variable and most of them showed weak reactions with VCG 4A and 4B. One sunflower isolate, Vs06-14, was compatible only with VCG3 testers, whereas another isolate, Vs06-20, was compatible with all VCG groups except VCG2A. Vegetative compatibility of four selected isolates, two from potato and two from sunflower, was also investigated after passing them through potato or sunflower for four generations. The VCG of one potato isolate did not change, whereas the other one changed from VCG4B to 4A. One sunflower isolate, initially compatible with both VCG4A and 4B, became incompatible with both. The other sunflower isolate was not compatible with any VCG and remained so. In a second part of this work, multiplex-nested-PCR was carried out to characterize VCGs of the same isolates of V. dahliae . Vegetative compatibility grouping using this approach assigned the V. dahliae isolates to VCG1, 2A, 3 or 4A. Six of the 12 potato isolates and four of the nine sunflower isolates of V. dahliae could not be identified or placed in any VCG group based on PCR results. In the present study, the multiplex-nested-PCR results were confirmed using nit mutants. As such, PCR-based methods will require more specific primers before they can replace the approach based on nit mutants. Current address of A.F.

Outbreaks have been reported in Africa and Asia since the early 1950s, from three CHIKV lineages: West African, East Central South African, and Asian Urban. As new outbreaks occurred in the Americas, individual strains from the known lineages have evolved, creating new monophyletic groups that generated novel geographic-based lineages. Building on a recently updated phylogeny of CHIKV, we report here the availability of an interactive CHIKV phylodynamics dataset, which is based on more than 900 publicly available CHIKV genomes. We provide an interactive view of CHIKV molecular epidemiology built on Nextstrain, a web-based visualization framework for real-time tracking of pathogen evolution. CHIKV molecular epidemiology reveals single nucleotide variants that change the stability and fold of locally stable RNA structures. We propose alternative RNA structure formation in different CHIKV lineages by predicting more than a dozen RNA elements that are subject to perturbation of the structure ensemble upon variation of a single nucleotide.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChikungunya virus 3aInternet 3aRNA 3adata collection 3ahumans 3amolecular epidemiology 3amonophyly 3apathogens 3aAfrica 3aAsia1 aDelitz, Markus 1 aSchneider, Adriano  de Bernardi1 aWolfinger, Michael  T.0 tGenes.g2021 Feb. 08, v. 12, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27140x2073-44257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/genes120202393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01836naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245010500172300001600277520071800293592002801011650001701039650002101056650001301077650002301090650001301113650000901126651001001135653001701145653001301162653001501175653003301190653002601223653002301249773009601272856008501368852000901453655001201462IND60568145520221120085310.0190411e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056814552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.protis.2017.04.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBourland, William10aHow Far do Ciliate Flagships Sail? A Proposed Gondawanaland Endemic Species at Anchor in Idaho Soils  ap. 352-361.  aIn terms of protist biogeography, “flagship species” (Foissner 2005) have been defined as those so remarkable or “showy” that they are unlikely to be overlooked when present in a given habitat. On this basis, flagship species have been suggested as an ideal or ultimate test for the existence of protist endemism. One example of a flagship ciliate is the terrestrial lepidosome-bearing trachelophyllid, Luporinophrys micelae, previously thought to be a Gondwanan endemic. This report comprises a morphologic description of two populations of L. micelae from Laurentian soils (Idaho, Northwest USA). The flagship concept is briefly reviewed and ciliate biogeography is discussed in light of these findings.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiogeography 3aflagship species 3ahabitats 3aindigenous species 3aprotists 3asoil 3aIdaho 0aBiogeography 0aendemism 0alepidosome 0ascanning electron microscopy 0aLuporinophrys micelae 0aTrachelophyllidae.0 tProtist.g2017 July, v. 168, no. 3 p.352-361dElsevier GmbHwJournal:12496x1434-46107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.protis.2017.04.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01910naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002000154245011100174300001600285520095900301592002801260650001501288650001401303650001101317650002101328700001801349700001401367773010701381856008801488990002301576852000901599655001201608IND60096157520221116171211.0141104e20130201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009615752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compbiomed.2012.11.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Guanghui10aDensity-based Monte Carlo filter and its applications in nonlinear stochastic differential equation models  ap. 135-143.  aNonlinear stochastic differential equation models with unobservable state variables are now widely used in analysis of PK/PD data. Unobservable state variables are usually estimated with extended Kalman filter (EKF), and the unknown pharmacokinetic parameters are usually estimated by maximum likelihood estimator. However, EKF is inadequate for nonlinear PK/PD models, and MLE is known to be biased downwards. A density-based Monte Carlo filter (DMF) is proposed to estimate the unobservable state variables, and a simulation-based M estimator is proposed to estimate the unknown parameters in this paper, where a genetic algorithm is designed to search the optimal values of pharmacokinetic parameters. The performances of EKF and DMF are compared through simulations for discrete time and continuous time systems respectively, and it is found that the results based on DMF are more accurate than those given by EKF with respect to mean absolute error.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aequations 3amodels 3apharmacokinetics1 aWan, Jianping1 aChen, Hui0 tComputers in Biology and Medicine.g2013 Feb. 1, v. 43, no. 2 p.135-143dElsevier Ltdx0010-48257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compbiomed.2012.11.0033Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01803naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245018300167300001600350520085500366592002801221650001401249650001301263650001801276650002001294700001801314773009801332856008601430852000901516655001201525IND60096657920221118015949.0141104e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009665792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2013.04.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnanth, J.10aExperimental studies on heat transfer and friction factor characteristics of thermosyphon solar water heating system fitted with regularly spaced twisted tape with rod and spacer  ap. 207-213.  aExperimental investigation of heat transfer and friction factor characteristics of thermosyphon solar water heater with full length helical twist of twist ratio 3, twist with rod and spacer of lengths 125, 250 and 500mm has been studied.

The typical symptoms of the disease are pale-green to yellow linear streaks parallel to the veins. The symptoms were observed on sweet corn in Denpasar, Tabanan, Gianyar, and Karangasem areas during a survey in 2015. Pathogen detection based on a polymerase chain reaction was carried out using total DNA obtained from symptomatic leaf samples and the pairs of primers, CPSL1/CPSR2c. The expected sized (~1100 bp) amplicon was detected in samples from Denpasar. Sequence analysis confirmed that Stewart’s wilt disease symptoms are caused by <em>Pantoea stewartii </em>subsp. <em>stewartii</em>. Nucleotide sequence and phylogenetic analysis showed that <em>P. stewartii </em>subsp. <em>stewartii </em>from Bali has high homology (98.97-99.08 %) and placed in the same clade with isolates from Canada, USA and Japan.

In this report, 23 cultivars, including local and foreign grape cultivars, were studied under field conditions in order to identify the different behaviors in response to water deficit, and how it can affect water use efficiency (WUE) at leaf level (intrinsic water use efficiency (WUEi) and leaf carbon isotope composition (δ13C)). Ψstem was used to assess plant water status. Under a common environment, a high variability was found in photosynthetic parameters, stomatal response, WUEi and leaf δ13C. This large variability observed represents an opportunity for genotype selection. Using different physiological traits we were able to select suitable cultivars for current and future viticulture. Under non-water stress situation the cultivar Escursac combined high rates of net photosynthesis with low stomatal conductance, resulting in high WUEi. In response to drought, strong, and moderate water saving behavior of local cultivars Manto Negro, Giró Ros, Argamussa and Vinater Negre resulted in higher WUEi. Long-term WUE (leaf δ13C) corroborate these cultivars as high water use efficient.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVitis 3acarbon 3acultivars 3adrought 3agenotype 3agrapes 3aisotopes 3aleaves 3aphotosynthesis 3astomatal conductance 3astomatal movement 3aviticulture 3awater conservation 3awater stress 3awater use efficiency 0aVitis vinifera L. 0aCarbon isotope composition 0aWater deficit 0aGenetic variability1 aTomás, M.1 aFlexas, J.1 aMedrano, H.1 aEscalona, J.M.0 tAgricultural water management.g2016 Jan. 31, v. 164 p.91-99dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8460x0378-37747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2015.07.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02268naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001400139245015400153300001600307520125600323592002801579650002101607650001601628650000901644650001801653650001101671650001001682650000901692700001601701700001501717700001801732773009801750856007301848852000901921655001201930IND60135850820221120124749.0150522e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013585082DNAL7 a10.1111/anu.121592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBlyth, D.10aComparison of faecal collection methods and diet acclimation times for the measurement of digestibility coefficients in barramundi (Lates calcarifer)  ap. 248-255.  aThis study aimed to investigate the effects of two faecal collection methods (stripping and settlement) on the apparent digestibility coefficients (ADC) of dry matter, protein and energy of three different diets fed to barramundi. In a second experiment, the effect of acclimation time (i.e. number of days fed the diet) on the calculation of ADCs was also investigated. Each tank of fish was fed one of three diets for 12 days. Faeces were collected by both stripping and settlement, although only settlement was used prior to day seven of the acclimation period. Faeces were collected using the settlement method at regular intervals from day 1 to day 12. Comparisons between faecal collection methods were only made based on faecal material collected over a similar acclimation period. The collection of faeces by stripping produced more conservative ADCs, which were also more consistent than those obtained using the settlement technique. The calculated ADCs typically fluctuated for the first 3 days of collection before the variability diminished. Barramundi should be acclimated to diets for a minimum of 4 days before collection of faecal material, and collection by stripping is recommended to obtain the most reliable digestibility data.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLates calcarifer 3aacclimation 3adiet 3adigestibility 3aenergy 3afeces 3afish1 aTabrett, S.1 aBourne, N.1 aGlencross, B.0 tAquaculture nutrition.g2015 Apr., v. 21, no. 2 p.248-255dBlackwell Sciencex1353-57737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/anu.121593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03347naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245015300173300001400326520198900340592002802329650001702357650002202374650001102396650001502407650002002422650002602442650000902468650001002477650001502487650001302502650001302515650000902528650002002537650001802557650001102575650001102586653002302597653001602620653002702636653002202663773011102685856008402796852000902880655001202889IND50087039120221119225846.0150325e20130101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008703912DNAL7 a10.1080/07060661.2012.7400762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbbasi, Pervaiz A.10aEstablishing suppressive conditions against soilborne potato diseases with low rates of fish emulsion applied serially as a pre-plant soil amendment  ap. 10-19.  aSoil amendment with fish emulsion (FE) can suppress potato scab and verticillium wilt, but the effective broadcast rates (20 000 L ha ⁻¹) may not be feasible for commercial use. The aim of this 4-year study was to establish suppressive conditions against soilborne potato diseases and increase tuber yield with economically feasible rates of FE. Diluted FE (1000 and 2000 L ha ⁻¹ or 0.05 and 0.1%) was applied to field plots or micro-plots twice a year before planting and after harvesting potatoes starting in autumn of 2007 and ending in spring of 2010. In the micro-plots, FE (0.1%) added to an infested potato soil (site BL) consistently reduced scab severity by 44.9% (2008), 44.8% (2009) and 30.9% (2010) compared with the control. Scab severity on tubers harvested from these plots was also low in 2011 when no further FE was applied, but the effect was not significant. In the field, FE (2000 L ha ⁻¹) consistently reduced scab severity by 45% (2008), 53% (2009), 44% (2010) and 38% (2011); reduced the percentage of tubers with deep-pitted scab by 48% (2008), 51% (2009), 66% (2010) and 77% (2011); and increased the percentage of marketable tubers by 37% (2008), 83% (2009), 20% (2010) and 8% (2011). These field plots also showed a low percentage of Verticillium dahliae -infected potato plants during the first 3 years of the field trial. Fish emulsion treatments increased total tuber yield by 7–20% in the first 3 years, but there was no effect in the fourth year when no FE was applied. Marketable tubers were consistently higher in the plots amended with FE (2000 L ha ⁻¹). Fish emulsion soil treatments increased soil bacteria but the numbers dropped to the control level in the fourth year when no FE application was made. There was no change in total fungal numbers. The results suggest that economically feasible rates of FE can provide disease suppression and enhance tuber yield and the effect may last a year or more after the last FE application.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVerticillium 3aVerticillium wilt 3aautumn 3acrop yield 3adisease control 3afield experimentation 3afish 3afungi 3aharvesting 3aplanting 3apotatoes 3asoil 3asoil amendments 3asoil bacteria 3aspring 3atubers 0adisease management 0apotato scab 0asoil organic amendment 0averticillium wilt0 tCanadian journal of plant pathology.g2013 Jan. 1, v. 35, no. 1 p.10-19dTaylor & Francisx1715-29927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07060661.2012.7400763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01648naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001500154245012900169300001600298520065200314592002800966650002000994650001701014650001601031650001101047650001701058700001501075700001701090773010701107856008801214990002301302852000901325655001201334IND60096157820221116171108.0141104e20130201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009615782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compbiomed.2012.11.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoos, M.W.10aComputational estimation of fluid mechanical benefits from a fluid deflector at the distal end of artificial vascular grafts  ap. 164-168.  aIntimal hyperplasia at the distal anastomosis is considered to be an important determinant for arterial and arteriovenous graft failure.

In practice, transdisciplinarity is more ambiguous. While there is a growing body of literature on such approaches, there remains no widely-accepted definition, concrete framework, or empirical strategy for how to carry out a transdisciplinary project. We propose that this lack of explicit structure and entrenched meaning leaves space for transdisciplinary approaches to be shaped by the evolving network of participating scientists and stakeholders, according to their perspectives of the approach and what it embodies. Here, we examine the perspectives of a diverse group of actors (n=42) embarking on a 10-year transdisciplinary research project focused on building resilience to natural hazards and disasters in New Zealand. We present the findings of qualitative surveys and group interviews that investigate stakeholders’ and scientists’ early perspectives of transdisciplinary, or co-created, research. The study represents the first stage of longitudinal research that will continue over the course of the project. Results show that early actors in the project share an overall consistent understanding of co-created research. Participants described a process that integrated diverse people and knowledge; created benefits on both a social and personal level; fostered clear, two-way dialogue; and overcame pragmatic and intrinsic challenges. Collectively, participants agreed with adopting transdisciplinary approaches to natural hazard, risk, and resilience research, with stakeholders showing a stronger degree of agreement than scientists. While attitudes towards transdisciplinarity were overall positive, a number of underlying conflicts emerged in regards to carrying out new modes of knowledge production within traditional social and institutional structures. These conflicts result in a tension that is felt by actors involved in transdisciplinary projects early on, and in some cases, influences perception of their ability to fully participate in such an approach. Evaluating actor perspectives and expectations early in the transdisciplinary process can give insight into how attitudes, expectations, and conflicts might shape transdisciplinary efforts, and can provide relevant parameters for assessing change over time.  aPublisher supplied data 3aattitudes and opinions 3aconcrete 3adisasters 3ainterviews 3aleaves 3arisk 3ascientists 3astakeholders 3asurveys 3aNew Zealand 0aTransdisciplinary research 0aKnowledge co-production 0aResilience 0aStakeholder engagement 0aRisk1 aOwen, Susan1 aLindsay, Jan M.1 aLeonard, Graham S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4859-01801 aCronin, Shane J.0 tEnvironmental science & policy.g2017 Aug., v. 74 p.30-39dElsevier LtdwJournal:12413x1462-90117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envsci.2017.04.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03026naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245012100167300001600288520173000304592002802034650001802062650001102080650002502091650001702116650001502133650002002148650001702168650001502185650002202200650002702222650001102249650001702260650004402277700002402321700002502345700002102370700002002391773010302411856008102514852000902595655001202604IND50072806420221119214630.0150212e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007280642DNAL7 a10.1007/s10811-013-0062-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStirk, Wendy A.10aAbscisic acid, gibberellins and brassinosteroids in Kelpak®, a commercial seaweed extract made from Ecklonia maxima  ap. 561-567.  aThe seaweed extract Kelpak®made from the kelp Ecklonia maxima is registered as a biostimulant for use in agriculture. It elicits many beneficial responses including improved root and shoot growth, higher yields and greater resistance to abiotic and biotic stresses. Previously, cytokinins, auxins and polyamines were identified in Kelpak®. The aim of the present study was to quantify other groups of plant growth regulators (PGRs)—abscisic acid (ABA), gibberellins (GAs) and brassinosteroids—that may be present in E. maxima and Kelpak®. Kelpak®samples harvested between 2008 and 2010 and stored for up to 26 months were analysed using ultra performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. ABA levels were below the limits of detection in E. maxima but were detected in low concentrations in Kelpak®, ranging from 0.31 to 20.70 pg mL⁻¹Kelpak®. Eighteen GAs were found in E. maxima and Kelpak®with concentrations from 187.54 to 565.96 pg mL⁻¹Kelpak®. The biologically active GAs (GA₁, GA₃, GA₄, GA₅, GA₆and GA₇) comprised less than 3 % in Kelpak®. Although GA₁₃(a final product in the metabolic pathway) was present in low concentrations in E. maxima, very high concentrations were present in Kelpak®. The brassinosteroids brassinolide (BL) and castasterone (CS) were identified in E. maxima and Kelpak®. Concentrations varied with harvest and storage time, ranging from 384.72 to 793.23 pg BL mL⁻¹Kelpak®and 62.84 to 567.51 pg CS mL⁻¹Kelpak®. It is likely that this cocktail of natural PGRs present in Kelpak®may act individually or in concert and thus contribute to the numerous favourable physiological responses elicited by Kelpak®application to plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabscisic acid 3aauxins 3abiochemical pathways 3abrassinolide 3acytokinins 3adetection limit 3agibberellins 3amacroalgae 3amass spectrometry 3aphysiological response 3ashoots 3astorage time 3aultra-performance liquid chromatography1 aTarkowská, Danuše1 aTurečová, Veronika1 aStrnad, Miroslav1 aVan Staden, J.,0 tJournal of applied phycology.g2014 Feb., v. 26, no. 1 p.561-567dSpringer-Verlagx0921-89717nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10811-013-0062-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03786naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005600150245010400206300001600310520208000326592002802406650001302434650000802447650003202455650001402487650001202501650002102513650002002534650001002554650002202564650001502586650001602601650002102617650001702638650001602655650001602671650001602687653003002703653001802733653002202751653001902773653002802792700001902820700001802839700001902857700003202876700002402908700002002932700002102952700002102973700002302994773009703017856008503114852000903199655001203208IND60597539620221120112757.0200712e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059753962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2018.05.0392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarzo, Aitor1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7795-524110aStandard or local solar spectrum? Implications for solar technologies studies in the Atacama desert  ap. 871-882.  aKnowledge of the solar spectrum is essential for the design and study of numerous technologies. Due to the area considered, the harsh conditions and the difficulty for accessing to some zones, information and measurement on local parameters and spectral resource are scarce. This fact, along with the special atmospheric conditions prevailing in Atacama Desert, has led to increasing interest on the part of the solar industry to ascertain the spectral variation respect to that of other places around the world. Considering the standard spectrum for a typical air mass as 1.5, the evaluation of PV module behaviour or device calibration under real conditions can generate a source of uncertainty where spectra may differ. This preliminary paper aims to study the influence of using the standard or local spectra in photovoltaic technologies in Atacama Desert, in order to highlight the necessity for a long-term ground-based measurement campaign. For that purpose, a first approach to the spatio-temporal average of solar spectrum in the Atacama Desert from satellite databases is estimated. Then, local spectra are compared against the Reference Spectra in order to show the differences in studies on solar energy applications. Long-term satellite database information is used to average the atmospheric parameters, such as Aerosol Optical Depth, Ozone, Precipitable Water Vapour, Albedo and Relative Humidity, for the entire Atacama Desert area and is then used to obtain the mean Global tilted Irradiance and Direct plus Circumsolar Irradiance solar spectrum. Finally, to study the influence that the shape of the local spectrum has on the performance of the different solar technologies, the photo-current density of two different solar cell types were studied under Atacama and standard conditions. The results indicate that there are considerable differences with the ASTM G173-03 reference spectra for short wavelengths, especially in the UV spectral range, which is 55% points higher than the reference, which influences in the performance of the solar technologies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3aair 3aalternative energy industry 3adatabases 3adeserts 3aelectric current 3alight intensity 3aozone 3arelative humidity 3asatellites 3asolar cells 3asolar collectors 3asolar energy 3auncertainty 3awater vapor 3awavelengths 0aSolar spectral irradiance 0aPhotovoltaics 0aReference spectra 0aAtacama desert 0aRemote sensing database1 aFerrada, Pablo1 aBeiza, Felipe1 aBesson, Pierre1 aAlonso-Montesinos, Joaquín1 aBallestrín, Jesús1 aRomán, Roberto1 aPortillo, Carlos1 aEscobar, Rodrigo1 aFuentealba, Edward0 tRenewable energy.g2018 Nov., v. 127 p.871-882dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2018.05.0393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03807naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002200125024001900147040001800166100002800184245015700212300001800369506007600387520020500463520204400668592002802712506003702740650001002777650001002787650002102797650001102818650002202829650001102851650001502862650001502877650002202892650002902914700002402943700002202967700001902989700001603008700002503024700002803049700001703077700001803094773011503112856007703227852000903304655001203313IND60172063420221207115722.0150602e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017206342DNAL7 a10.1104/pp.114.2489302doi7 aPMC42568592pmcid7 a253156042pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKuppusamy, Thirumurugen10aLipid Biosynthesis and Protein Concentration Respond Uniquely to Phosphate Supply during Leaf Development in Highly Phosphorus-Efficient Hakea prostrata  ap. 1891-1911.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe Australian Proteaceae Hakea prostrata transcriptionally regulates only a small number of genes to generate polar leaf lipid profiles associated with delayed greening and efficient phosphorus use .  aHakea prostrata (Proteaceae) is adapted to severely phosphorus-impoverished soils and extensively replaces phospholipids during leaf development. We investigated how polar lipid profiles change during leaf development and in response to external phosphate supply. Leaf size was unaffected by a moderate increase in phosphate supply. However, leaf protein concentration increased by more than 2-fold in young and mature leaves, indicating that phosphate stimulates protein synthesis. Orthologs of known lipid-remodeling genes in Arabidopsis ( Arabidopsis thaliana ) were identified in the H. prostrata transcriptome. Their transcript profiles in young and mature leaves were analyzed in response to phosphate supply alongside changes in polar lipid fractions. In young leaves of phosphate-limited plants, phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylethanolamine and associated transcript levels were higher, while phosphatidylglycerol and sulfolipid levels were lower than in mature leaves, consistent with low photosynthetic rates and delayed chloroplast development. Phosphate reduced galactolipid and increased phospholipid concentrations in mature leaves, with concomitant changes in the expression of only four H. prostrata genes, GLYCEROPHOSPHODIESTER PHOSPHODIESTERASE1 , N-METHYLTRANSFERASE2 , NONSPECIFIC PHOSPHOLIPASE C4 , and MONOGALACTOSYLDIACYLGLYCEROL3 . Remarkably, phosphatidylglycerol levels decreased with increasing phosphate supply and were associated with lower photosynthetic rates. Levels of polar lipids with highly unsaturated 32:x (x = number of double bonds in hydrocarbon chain) and 34:x acyl chains increased. We conclude that a regulatory network with a small number of central hubs underpins extensive phospholipid replacement during leaf development in H. prostrata . This hard-wired regulatory framework allows increased photosynthetic phosphorus use efficiency and growth in a low-phosphate environment. This may have rendered H. prostrata lipid metabolism unable to adjust to higher internal phosphate concentrations.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aHakea 3agenes 3aleaf development 3aleaves 3alipid composition 3alipids 3aphosphates 3aphosphorus 3aprotein synthesis 3atranscription (genetics)1 aGiavalisco, Patrick1 aArvidsson, Samuel1 aSulpice, Ronan1 aStitt, Mark1 aFinnegan, Patrick M.1 aScheible, Wolf-Rüdiger1 aLambers, H.,1 aJost, Ricarda0 tPlant physiology.g2014 Dec., v. 166, no. 4 p.1891-1911dAmerican Society of Plant Biologistsx0032-08897nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1104/pp.114.2489303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03677naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002700112245014200139300001600281520228900297592002802586650001802614650002802632650003402660650002702694650001402721650002902735650001902764650001402783650001502797650001302812650001002825650001902835650001002854650001402864651001502878653001902893653002502912653001502937653002002952653001402972700002202986700002003008700002303028773012303051961001203174852000903186655001203195IND60126602720221122085344.0151124e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012660272DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFettig, Christopher J.12aA Novel Semiochemical Tool for Protecting Pinus contorta from Mortality Attributed to Dendroctonus ponderosae (Coleoptera: Curculionidae)  ap. 173-182.  aVerbenone (4,6,6-trimethylbicyclo[3.1.1]hept-3-en-2-one) is an antiaggregant of the mountain pine beetle, Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), a notable forest insect capable of causing extensive levels of tree mortality in western North America. Several formulations of verbenone are registered for tree protection, but failures in efficacy are not uncommon, particularly when applied during large infestations. A formulation of (—)-verbenone was developed (Specialized Pheromone & Lure Application Technology [SPLAT] Verb, ISCA Technologies Inc., Riverside, CA) and evaluated for protecting individual lodgepole pine, Pinus contorta Douglas ex Loudon, and small stands of P. contorta from mortality attributed to D. ponderosae. SPLAT Verb applied to individual P. contorta resulted in complete tree protection, while 93.3% mortality occurred in the untreated controls. Significantly fewer P. contorta were killed by D. ponderosae within 0.041-ha circular plots surrounding P. contorta treated with SPLAT Verb compared with the untreated control. In a second study, a smaller percentage of P. contorta were colonized and killed on 0.4-ha square plots treated with SPLAT Verb compared with the untreated control. No significant differences in levels of tree mortality were observed between the untreated control and another formulation of verbenone (7-g pouch) or between the 7-g pouch and SPLAT Verb. In a trapping bioassay, no significant differences were observed among captures in multiple-funnel traps at 1, 2, or 4m from the point of release of SPLAT Verb. Significantly fewer D. ponderosae were collected at 1 and 2m compared with 8m. Significantly more D. ponderosae were captured at the farthest distance evaluated (16m) than at any other distance. Our data indicate that SPLAT Verb is effective for protecting individual P. contorta and small stands of P. contorta from mortality attributed to D. ponderosae at moderate doses. The high levels of tree protection observed are attributed to the ability of applying release points (dollops) at high densities, and a larger zone of inhibition than reported for other formulations of verbenone. SPLAT Verb was registered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for use on pines, Pinus spp., in 2013.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCurculionidae 3aDendroctonus ponderosae 3aPinus contorta var. latifolia 3aapplication technology 3abioassays 3aenvironmental protection 3aforest insects 3amortality 3apheromones 3atrapping 3atraps 3atree mortality 3atrees 3averbenone 3aCalifornia 0alodgepole pine 0amountain pine beetle 0aSPLAT Verb 0atree protection 0averbenone1 aMunson, A.

POME final discharge quality is normally determined based on conventional chemical detection such as by biological oxygen demand (BOD) and chemical oxygen demand (COD). The novelty of the present study is that the toxicity effects of the POME final discharge samples were evaluated based on whole effluent toxicity (WET) and toxicity identification evaluation (TIE) tests using Daphnia magna. The toxicity unit (TU) values were recorded to be in the range from TU = 1.1–11 obtained from WET, and the TIE manipulation tests suggested that a substantial amount of toxic compounds was contained in the POME final discharge. Phenol, 2,6-bis (1,1-dimethylethyl)- and heavy metals such as Cu and Zn were detected in all the effluents and were recognized as being the main toxicants in the POME final discharge. GC/MS analyses also successfully identified cyclic volatile methyl siloxanes; cyclotetrasiloxane, octamethyl- (D4), cyclopentasiloxane, decamethyl- (D5), cyclohexasiloxane, dodecamethyl- (D6). D4 was detected at 0.0148–0.0357 mg/L, which could be potentially toxic. The palm oil industry used only water in the form of steam to process the fruits, and the presence of these compounds might be derived from the detergents and grease used in palm oil mill cleaning and maintenance operations. An appropriate treatment process is thus required to eliminate these toxicants from the POME final discharge. It is recommended that two approaches, chemical-based monitoring as well as biological toxicity-based monitoring, should be utilized for achieving an acceptable quality of POME final discharge in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDaphnia magna 3abiochemical oxygen demand 3abiodegradability 3achemical oxygen demand 3acleaning 3acopper 3adetergents 3afats and oils industry 3afruits 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3aheavy metals 3aoil mill effluents 3apalm oils 3aphenol 3aplankton 3asiloxanes 3asteam 3atoxic substances 3atoxicity 3azinc 0aWhole effluent toxicity 0aToxicity identification evaluation 0aPalm oil mill effluent final discharge 0aPhenol 0aHeavy metals1 aZakaria, Mohd Rafein1 aMaeda, Toshinari1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6219-91101 aYusoff, Mohd Zulkhairi Mohd1 aHassan Mohd.

We have previously shown that peripheral T cell proliferation and cytokine production is altered in GPAT-1 gene-ablated (KO) mice. This finding is important in light of the reduction in GPAT-1 activity associated with aged T cells. To determine if the mechanism for altered peripheral T cell function is linked to altered T cell development, we assessed thymic function in 3, 6 and 16-week old GPAT-1 KO compared to wild type (WT) mice. At 16 weeks of age, there was a significant reduction in thymic T cell production in KO compared to WT mice but not at 6 weeks of age. The reduced thymic T cell production was associated with altered thymic development as confirmed by increased numbers of double-negative (DN) thymocytes and a significant reduction in the double positive (DP) thymocytes suggesting a developmental block at the DN stage. This change was accompanied by an increase in the single positive CD4 subset. These changes were associated with reduced glycerophospholipid mass while thymic cortex and medulla architecture was not altered by GPAT-1 KO. Taken together, these data suggest that GPAT-1 deletion is capable of reducing the number of new T cells produced via alterations in membrane receptor function rather than by causing deleterious changes within the thymic microenvironment explaining in part the observed alterations in peripheral T cell function.  aPublisher supplied data 3aT-lymphocytes 3abiosynthesis 3acell proliferation 3acortex 3acytokines 3agenes 3aglycerol 3alipid content 3amice 3athymocytes 3atriacylglycerols1 aMurphy, Eric J.1 aCiolino, Henry P.1 aCabrera, Robert M.1 aJolly, Christopher A.0 tLipids.g2013 Jan., v. 48, no. 1 p.3-12dSpringer-Verlagx0024-42017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11745-012-3741-7  aDNAL 7aarticle03360naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149100002400167245010400191300001600295520148800311592002801799650001701827650000901844650001101853650002501864650001701889650001501906650001301921650001601934650001701950650002701967650001501994650001502009650002002024650002502044650002102069650001602090650003002106650001802136650001002154650002502164650003802189650001202227650002902239650002802268650003702296650002302333650003302356650001602389650001002405650005302415700002002468700002402488700002702512773010202539856008402641852000902725655001202734IND4469880020221120124209.0141111e20120430xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446988002DNAL7 a220303752pmid7 a10.1016/j.vetpar.2011.10.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEsmaeilnejad, Bijan10aEvaluation of antioxidant status and oxidative stress in sheep naturally infected with Babesia ovis  ap. 124-130.  aThe present study aimed to assess antioxidant status and oxidative stress in sheep naturally infected with Babesia ovis. Red blood cell (RBC) count, hemoglobin (Hb) concentration, packed cell volume (PCV), piroplasm parasitemia percentage, malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration, erythrocyte superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), catalase (CAT) activities and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) were determined in 52 sheep naturally infected with B. ovis as well as same number of healthy sheep in West-Azerbaijan province, Iran. Microscopic examination of Giemsa-stained peripheral blood smears revealed B. ovis infection. The parasitological diagnosis was confirmed using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis by amplifying a partial small subunit ribosomal RNA (ssu rRNA) gene sequence of B. ovis of 52 diseased sheep, 18 (34.61%), 11 (21.15%), 16 (30.76%) and 7 (13.48%) had <1%, 1–2%, 2–3% and >3% parasitemia, respectively. Compared to controls, the activities of erythrocyte GSH-Px, SOD, TAC and CAT showed a significant decrease, whereas the concentration of MDA in erythrocytes of infected sheep increased significantly. Parasitemia rate was positively correlated with MDA and negatively correlated with PCV, SOD, CAT, GSH-Px and TAC. Also, MDA was negatively correlated with PCV, SOD, catalase, GSH-Px and TAC. The study demonstrated that B. ovis plays an important role in the occurrence of oxidative damage to RBCs and anemia in ovine babesiosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBabesia ovis 3aOvis 3aanemia 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3ababesiosis 3acatalase 3acorrelation 3aerythrocytes 3aglutathione peroxidase 3ahematocrit 3ahemoglobin 3amalondialdehyde 3anucleotide sequences 3aoxidative stress 3aparasitemia 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aribosomal RNA 3asheep 3asuperoxide dismutase 2aAnemiaxparasitologyxveterinary. 2aAnimals 2aAntioxidantsxmetabolism 2aBabesiaxclassification 2aBabesiosisxbloodxparasitology. 2aLipid Peroxidation 2aOxidative Stressxphysiology 2aParasitemia 2aSheep 2aSheep Diseasesxbloodxmetabolismxparasitology.1 aTavassoli, Mosa1 aAsri-Rezaei, Siamak1 aDalir-Naghadeh, Bahram0 tVeterinary parasitology.g2012 Apr. 30, v. 185, no. 2-4 p.124-130dElsevier B.V.x0304-40177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetpar.2011.10.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02470naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245007400172300001400246520097600260592002801236650002601264650002801290650001501318650002101333650002301354650002301377650002601400650001201426650001101438650002501449650001301474650005201487650001201539653002001551653001801571653001201589653001601601653002901617700001701646700002501663700001801688700001801706700001801724700001801742773011101760856008401871852000901955655001201964IND50087039520221119225725.0150325e20130101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008703952DNAL7 a10.1080/07060661.2012.7527632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAgindotan, Bright10aDetection of Switchgrass mosaic virus in Miscanthus and other grasses  ap. 81-86.  aA new marafivirus tentatively named Switchgrass mosaic virus (SwMV) was recently detected in Panicum virgatum L. (switchgrass). The virus is related to Maize rayado fino virus (MRFV). As Miscanthus and other grass species are grown alongside switchgrass in our experimental fields, there has been concern that the virus could be transmitted to these plants. To investigate this possibility, leaf samples from Miscanthus spp. and other grasses rotated with switchgrass in a field planting were tested for SwMV by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Switchgrass mosaic virus was detected in leaf samples of Miscanthus × giganteus , M. sinensis , M. transmorrisonensis , Saccharum ravennae , Andropogon virginicus and Sorghastrum nutans . The nucleotide sequences of the amplicons from these samples were 99% identical to SwMV in switchgrass. This is the first report of SwMV detection in Miscanthus spp. and the other grasses, apart from switchgrass.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAndropogon virginicus 3aMaize rayado fino virus 3aMiscanthus 3aPanicum virgatum 3aSaccharum ravennae 3aSorghastrum nutans 3afield experimentation 3agrasses 3aleaves 3anucleotide sequences 3aplanting 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3aviruses 0abioenergy crops 0abiomass crops 0agrasses 0amarafivirus 0aSwitchgrass mosaic virus1 aOkanu, Ngozi1 aOladeinde, Adebosola1 aVoigt, Thomas1 aLong, Stephen1 aGray, Michael1 aBradley, Carl0 tCanadian journal of plant pathology.g2013 Jan. 1, v. 35, no. 1 p.81-86dTaylor & Francisx1715-29927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07060661.2012.7527633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01781naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245012200167300001600289520078300305592002801088650001701116650001101133650000901144650001201153650001801165650001901183650001601202650002301218700002101241773009801262856008601360852000901446655001201455IND60096658720221118015955.0141104e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009665872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2013.04.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAvci, Mete10aExperimental study of thermal energy storage characteristics of a paraffin in a horizontal tube-in-shell storage unit  ap. 271-277.  aIn this study, the latent heat thermal energy storage system of the horizontal shell-and-tube type is experimentally analyzed. Paraffin is used as the phase change material (PCM) while the distilled water is used as the HTF. At first, the thermo-physical properties of the paraffin used are determined through the differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) analysis. Experiments are conducted to investigate not only the storage behavior (melting or charging) but also the removal one (solidification or discharging) of the PCM. Effect of the inlet temperature on the melting (for the charging) and solidification (for the discharging) time is determined. The focus is on the understanding the physics of the process based on the temporal variation of temperature field inside PCM.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalorimeters 3aenergy 3aheat 3amelting 3amelting point 3asolidification 3atemperature 3atemporal variation1 aYazici, M.

Eighteen healthy young men participated in each of the three trials of the study: rest, exercise with placebo, and exercise with fermented milk. In the exercise trials, subjects carried out resistance exercise consisting of five sets of leg and bench presses at 70-100% 12 repetition maximum. Examination beverage (fermented milk or placebo) was taken before and after exercise in double-blind method. On the following day, we conducted an analysis of respiratory metabolic performance, blood collection, and evaluation of muscle soreness. Muscle soreness was significantly suppressed by the consumption of fermented milk compared with placebo (placebo, 14.2 ± 1.2 score vs. fermented milk, 12.6 ± 1.1 score, p < 0.05). Serum creatine phosphokinase was significantly increased by exercise, but this increase showed a tendency of suppression after the consumption of fermented milk. Exercise significantly decreased the respiratory quotient (rest, 0.88 ± 0.01 vs. placebo, 0.84 ± 0.02, p < 0.05), although this decrease was negated by the consumption of fermented milk (0.88 ± 0.01, p < 0.05). Furthermore, exercise significantly reduced the absorption capacity of serum oxygen radical (rest, 6.9 ± 0.4 μmol TE/g vs. placebo, 6.0 ± 0.3 μmol TE/g, p < 0.05), although this reduction was not observed with the consumption of fermented milk (6.2 ± 0.3 μmol TE/g). These results suggest that fermented milk supplementation improves glucose metabolism and alleviates the effects of muscle soreness after high-intensity exercise, possibly associated with the regulation of antioxidant capacity.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aabsorption 3aantioxidant activity 3abeverages 3ablood 3acreatine kinase 3aexercise 3afermented milk 3afree radicals 3aglucose 3ahumans 3alegs 3amen 3ametabolism 3amilk consumption 3amuscles 3aoxygen 3aplacebos 3arespiratory quotient 2aBlood Glucosexmetabolism 2aBody Mass Index 2aBody Weight 2aC-Reactive Proteinxmetabolism 2aCarbohydrate Metabolism 2aCholesterol, HDLxblood 2aCholesterol, LDLxblood 2aCreatine Kinasexblood 2aDairy Products 2aDouble-Blind Method 2aFermentation 2aHealthy Volunteers 2aHumans 2aLactic Acidxblood 2aLactobacillus helveticus 2aMale 2aMuscle, Skeletalxphysiopathology 2aOxidative Stressxphysiology 2aReactive Oxygen Speciesxblood 2aResistance Trainingxadverse effects 2aTriglyceridesxblood 2aTumor Necrosis Factor-alphaxblood 2aYoung Adult1 aAoi, Wataru1 aMune, Keitaro1 aYamauchi, Haruka1 aFuruta, Kaori1 aSasaki, Shota1 aTakeda, Kazuya1 aHarada, Kiyomi1 aWada, Sayori1 aNakamura, Yasushi1 aSatō, Kenji,1 aHigashi, Akane0 tNutrition journal.g2013 Dec., v. 12, no. 1 p.657-657dSpringer-Verlagx1475-28917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1475-2891-12-833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02514naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001600112245015500128300001600283520113500299592002801434650001101462650000801473650001601481650001401497650002001511650002701531650000901558650001101567650001101578650001301589650003301602650003001635650001501665650002901680651001001709653002301719653002801742653005701770653002001827653001001847700001701857700001901874700001901893773012301912852000902035655001202044IND60126603020221120233737.0151124e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012660302DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAguirre, C.12aA PCR-Based Diagnostic System for Differentiating Two Weevil Species (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) of Economic Importance to the Chilean Citrus Industry  ap. 107-113.  aA PCR-based method was developed to identify Naupactus cervinus (Boheman) and Naupactus xanthographus (Germar), two curculionids affecting the citrus industry in Chile. The quarantine status of these two species depends on the country to which fruits are exported. This identification method was developed because it is not possible to discriminate between these two species at the egg stage. The method is based on the species-specific amplification of sequences of internal transcribed spacers, for which we cloned and sequenced these genome fragments from each species. We designed an identification system based on two duplex-PCR reactions. Each one contains the species-specific primer set and a second generic primer set that amplify a short 18S region common to coleopterans, to avoid false negatives. The marker system is able to differentiate each Naupactus species at any life stage, and with a diagnostic sensitivity to 0.045 ng of genomic DNA. This PCR kit was validated by samples collected from different citrus production areas throughout Chile and showed 100% accuracy in differentiating the two Naupactus species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCitrus 3aDNA 3aDNA primers 3aNaupactus 3acrop production 3adiagnostic sensitivity 3aeggs 3afruits 3agenome 3aindustry 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aquarantine 3atranscription (genetics) 3aChile 0aNaupactus cervinus 0aNaupactus xanthographus 0ainternal transcribed spacer of nuclear ribosomal DNA 0acitrus industry 0aChile1 aOlivares, N.1 aLuppichini, P.1 aHinrichsen, P.0 tJournal of economic entomology.g2015 Feb., v. 108, no. 1 p.107-113dEntomological Society of Americax0022-04937nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03066naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001100139245024600150300001600396520148900412592002801901650002801929650002701957650002001984650001602004650000902020650002702029650002402056650001402080650002002094650001002114650001202124650001902136650003502155650000902190650002102199650002802220650002002248650001202268650002402280650002502304700001202329700001102341700001402352700001402366773009802380856007302478852000902551655001202560IND60135851320221120124551.0150522e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013585132DNAL7 a10.1111/anu.121692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, C.10aDietary n‐3 highly unsaturated fatty acids affect the biological and serum biochemical parameters, tissue fatty acid profile, antioxidation status and expression of lipid‐metabolism‐related genes in grass carp, Ctenopharyngodon idellus  ap. 373-383.  aA 95‐day feeding trial was conducted to determine the effects of n‐3 highly unsaturated fatty acids (n‐3 HUFA) on the growth, antioxidation and lipid metabolism in grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idellus). Two isonitrogenous and isolipidic diets were formulated with either lard oil (LO) or fish oil (FO) as the main lipid source. The results showed that the intraperitoneal fat (IPF) ratio was significantly lower (P < 0.05) in FO group. The concentration of n‐3 HUFA in muscle, hepatopancreas and IPF was significantly higher in FO group (P < 0.05). The serum low‐density lipoprotein (LDL) content was significantly lower (P < 0.05), and glucose (GLU) content was significantly higher (P < 0.05) in FO group. The serum total superoxide dismutase (T‐SOD) activity was significantly higher (P < 0.05) in FO group, consistent with the serum malondialdehyde (MDA) content. The gene expression of IPF fatty acid synthase (FAS), acetyl‐CoA carboxylase (ACC), sterol regulatory element‐binding protein (SREBP‐1) and peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor γ (PPARγ) was significantly lower (P < 0.05) and that of peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor α (PPARα) was significantly higher (P < 0.05) in FO group compared with LO group. Similar trends were found in the hepatopancreas, except for PPARγ. It is suggested that n‐3 HUFA could inhibit lipid accumulation in grass carp by affecting the expression of lipid‐metabolism‐related genes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCtenopharyngodon idella 3aacetyl-CoA carboxylase 3ablood chemistry 3ablood serum 3adiet 3afatty acid composition 3afatty-acid synthase 3afish oils 3agene expression 3agenes 3aglucose 3ahepatopancreas 3ahighly unsaturated fatty acids 3alard 3alipid metabolism 3alow density lipoprotein 3amalondialdehyde 3amuscles 3aomega-3 fatty acids 3asuperoxide dismutase1 aLiu, P.1 aJi, H.1 aHuang, J.1 aZhang, W.0 tAquaculture nutrition.g2015 June, v. 21, no. 3 p.373-383dBlackwell Sciencex1353-57737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/anu.121693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03369naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245018600172300001200358520193200370592002802302650001602330650002002346650002302366650000902389650001102398650001102409650001602420650001302436650001402449650001602463650001902479650000902498650001302507650001402520650001902534650002402553700002202577700002202599700001702621700006402638773011702702856008302819852000902902655001202911IND60711460020221121223502.0210731e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071146002DNAL7 a10.1186/s12917-020-02567-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaker-Meuten, Alice10aEvaluation of acupuncture for the treatment of pain associated with naturally-occurring osteoarthritis in dogs: a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, blinded clinical trial  ap. 357.  aBACKGROUND: Acupuncture has been used as a treatment for pain associated with osteoarthritis (OA) for thousands of years; however, there is a lack of definitive evidence for this indication in humans or animals. The aim of this study was to prospectively evaluate the efficacy of acupuncture on lameness and clinical function in dogs affected by naturally-occurring OA using objective outcome measures. A total of 32 client-owned dogs completed this prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, blinded clinical trial, using a cross-over design. Participants were assigned to receive placebo or acupuncture treatment once weekly for 4 weeks in random order with a two-week wash-out period in between treatment phases. Outcome measures included ground reaction forces (GRF), subjective orthopedic scoring (SOS), activity counts (AC), and owner-completed clinical metrology instruments (CMI; Canine Brief Pain Inventory [CBPI] and Client Specific Outcome Measures [CSOM]). For statistical comparison, baseline GRF, SOS, and CMI data were compared to data obtained 1 week after each treatment phase. Similarly, total weekly AC of the final week of each treatment phase were compared to the baseline week. RESULTS: Evidence of differences between baseline versus acupuncture and placebo treatments was not identified for the following outcome measures: GRF, AC, or SOS. However, evidence of differences was identified for some of the CMI scores, including the CSOM questionnaire which showed evidence of improvement when comparing baseline versus acupuncture (p = 0.0002) as well as between placebo versus acupuncture treatments (p = 0.035) but not between baseline versus placebo treatments (p = 0.221). CONCLUSIONS: The applied acupuncture protocol did not show improvement in function when using objective outcome measures for OA in dogs; however, certain CMI measurements recorded some degree of treatment response.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacupuncture 3aclinical trials 3across-over studies 3adogs 3aforces 3ahumans 3ainventories 3alameness 3ametrology 3aorthopedics 3aosteoarthritis 3apain 3aplacebos 3aprotocols 3aquestionnaires 3aveterinary medicine1 aWendland, Theresa1 aShamir, Shelly K.1 aHess, Ann M.1 aDuerr, Felix Michael1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0456-10860 tBMC veterinary research.g2020 Dec., v. 16, no. 1 p.357-357dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4152735x1746-61487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12917-020-02567-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01559naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001200149245010700161300001800268520037400286592002800660650001200688650002100700650002300721650002300744650002300767650001100790650001400801700001900815700001900834700001500853700005800868700005800926773012100984856008301105852000901188655001201197IND60621255520221119064321.0181116e20181026xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062125552DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.8b030682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Yan10aPalladium-Catalyzed Three-Component Reaction: A Novel Method for the Synthesis of N-Acyl Propiolamides  ap. 7117-7120.  aPalladium-catalyzed three-component reactions between terminal alkynes, isonitriles, and sodium carboxylates have been developed.

However, this stimulated concern that the addition of the gene might facilitate an increase in the potential for weediness of genetically modified cultivars in noncropping habitats. Bt and conventional cottonseeds were planted in 12 sites in northern Australia to test the hypothesis that there would be no increase in the ability of Bt cotton vs. conventional cotton to establish weedy, or invasive populations, defined as population growth over time greater than one, irrespective of location, habitat, seed type, or population density. Invasiveness was a factor of germination, survival, and recruitment. We examined whether the addition of the Bt gene would increase fitness of these parameters, and associated invasiveness. An irrigation drain was considered a high-risk habitat for cotton establishment, so an additional site was sown at that habitat to provide supplementary data to the original 12 sites. Location and habitat were the dominant factors influencing germination, survival, fecundity, and invasiveness. Bt and non-Bt cottonseeds did not differ in their ability to germinate, establish, and survive. After 2 yr, cotton plant survival was very low, and only 3 of 13 sites established fecund cotton populations. Measurements continued for an additional 2 yr at these sites. There was no increase in values for invasiveness for the Bt genotype treatments at any location or habitat after 2 yr or at two selected habitats after > 4 yr, demonstrating that the addition of the Bt gene will not confer increased fitness for weediness. Mean invasiveness values for each habitat, irrespective of genotype, were less than one, indicating that neither conventional nor Bt cotton would establish invasive cotton populations in northern Australian habitats.Nomenclature: Bt, Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki; cotton, Gossypium hirsutum L. ‘‘Sicot 289’’.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGossypium hirsutum 3acotton 3atransgenic plants 3aplant-incorporated protectants 3aBacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki 3apest resistance 3aweeds 3aplant competition 3acultivars 3ainvasive species 3ahabitats 3aenvironmental factors 3aplant density 3aseed germination 3amortality 3aplant establishment 3afecundity 3aNorthern Territory 0aTransgenic 0ainvasiveness 0anatural habitats 0agenetically modified1 aHearnden, Mark N.0 tWeed science.g2006 Nov., v. 54, no. 6 p.1142-1151dWeed Science Society of America]x0043-17457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1614%2FWS-06-077R.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02618naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002100143245013400164520125100298592002801549650002201577650001801599650002501617650000901642650001301651650001301664650001401677650001401691650001901705650002501724650001201749650001801761650001301779650001101792650005201803650002201855700002201877700002301899700002301922700002201945773011901967856007702086852000902163655001202172IND60729280620221117223253.0210228e20210210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072928062DNAL7 a10.3390/genes120202482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMlitz, Veronika 14aThe Trichohyalin-Like Protein Scaffoldin Is Expressed in the Multilayered Periderm during Development of Avian Beak and Egg Tooth  aScaffoldin, an S100 fused-type protein (SFTP) with high amino acid sequence similarity to the mammalian hair follicle protein trichohyalin, has been identified in reptiles and birds, but its functions are not yet fully understood. Here, we investigated the expression pattern of scaffoldin and cornulin, a related SFTP, in the developing beaks of birds. We determined the mRNA levels of both SFTPs by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in the beak and other ectodermal tissues of chicken (Gallus gallus) and quail (Coturnix japonica) embryos. Immunohistochemical staining was performed to localize scaffoldin in tissues. Scaffoldin and cornulin were expressed in the beak and, at lower levels, in other embryonic tissues of both chickens and quails. Immunohistochemistry revealed scaffoldin in the peridermal compartment of the egg tooth, a transitory cornified protuberance (caruncle) on the upper beak which breaks the eggshell during hatching. Furthermore, scaffoldin marked a multilayered peridermal structure on the lower beak. The results of this study suggest that scaffoldin plays an evolutionarily conserved role in the development of the avian beak with a particular function in the morphogenesis of the egg tooth.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCoturnix japonica 3aGallus gallus 3aamino acid sequences 3abeak 3achickens 3aectoderm 3aegg shell 3aegg tooth 3ahair follicles 3aimmunohistochemistry 3amammals 3amorphogenesis 3aperiderm 3aquails 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asequence homology1 aHermann, Marcela 1 aBuchberger, Maria 1 aTschachler, Erwin 1 aEckhart, Leopold 0 tGenes.g2021 Feb. 10, v. 12, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27140x2073-44257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/genes120202483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03177naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245015200164300001600316506011700332506007600449520129500525592002801820506003701848650001001885650001401895650001101909650001001920650002401930650001201954650001501966650001101981650001501992650001602007650001702023650002202040650002602062650001802088650001102106653001902117653001502136653002702151653000902178653001102187700001502198700001702213700001202230700001302242700001602255773026102271856008202532852000902614655001202623IND60783896220221207060735.0220929e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078389622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.hpj.2022.07.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDuan, Xiaoyu10aTranscriptome and metabolomics analysis revealed that CmWRKY49 regulating CmPSY1 promotes β-carotene accumulation in orange fleshed oriental melon  ap. 650-666.  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe flesh color of oriental melons is an important commercial trait that affects consumer preferences. To explore the mechanisms underlying the flesh color formation and regulation during fruit ripening, carotenoid-targeted metabolomic and RNA-seq analysis were conducted between white-fleshed (WF) and orange-fleshed (OF) oriental melon cultivars at different stages. The carotenoid-targeted metabolomic analysis indicated that β-carotene was the major metabolite that caused differences in flesh color between the two cultivars. Additionally, through KEGG pathway enrichment and weighted gene co-expression network (WGCNA) analysis, metabolic pathways and related transcription factors that are associated with carotenoid metabolism were selected and transcriptome data was verified using RT-qPCR. Finally, the yeast one hybrid and luciferase activity showed that the transcription factor CmWRKY49 could directly bind to the CmPSY1 promoter to activate its expression in the ‘OF’ cultivar. Transient overexpression of CmWRKY49 in ‘OF’ cultivar increased the β-carotene content, while the β-carotene content decreased when it was silenced in the same cultivar. This study provides insights into the underlying regulatory network of carotenoid metabolism in oriental melon fruit.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acolor 3acultivars 3afruits 3agenes 3ahorticultural crops 3ahybrids 3aluciferase 3amelons 3ametabolism 3ametabolites 3ametabolomics 3asequence analysis 3atranscription factors 3atranscriptome 3ayeasts 0aOriental melon 0aCarotenoid 0aTranscriptome analysis 0aWRKY 0aCmPSY11 aJiang, Cai1 aZhao, Yaping1 aGao, Ge1 aLi, Meng1 aQi, Hongyan0 tHorticultural plant journal.g2022 Sept., v. 8, no. 5 p.650-666dElsevier B.V.aChinese Society for Horticultural Science (CSHS) and Institute of Vegetables and Flowers (IVF), Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences (CAAS).wJournal:23309x2468-01417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.hpj.2022.07.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03326naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245010200165300001200267520152400279592002801803596005901831596006201890596007601952650001102028650000802039650003502047650001802082650002502100650001302125650002402138650001302162650001102175650002302186650002302209650001402232650001502246650001502261650002102276650002402297700001302321700001802334700001402352700001702366700001702383700001602400700001602416700001502432700001402447700001502461700001702476700001702493700001702510773010502527856008302632852000902715655001202724IND60711460220221121223640.0220630e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071146022DNAL7 a10.1186/s12937-020-00625-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Sijing10aAssociation of plasma chromium with metabolic syndrome among Chinese adults: a case-control study  ap. 107.  aBACKGROUD: Chromium has been suggested playing a role in alleviating diabetes, insulin resistance and lipid anomalies, but the effect on metabolic syndrome (MetS) in humans remains controversial. METHODS: We conducted a matched case-control study in a Chinese population, involving 2141 MetS cases and 2141 healthy controls, which were 1:1 matched by age (±2 years) and sex. Plasma chromium was measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Plasma chromium levels were lower in MetS group than in control group (mean: 4.36 μg/L and 4.66 μg/L, respectively, P < 0.001), and progressively decreased with the number of MetS components (P for trend < 0.001). After adjustment for potential confounding factors, the odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) for MetS across increasing quartiles of plasma chromium levels were 1 (reference), 0.84 (0.67–1.05), 0.76 (0.61–0.95), and 0.62 (0.49–0.78), respectively (P for trend < 0.001). For the components of MetS (high waist circumference, high triglycerides and high blood glucose), the odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) of the highest quartiles were 0.77 (0.61–0.95), 0.67 (0.55–0.80), and 0.53 (0.44–0.64), respectively (P for trend < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicated that plasma chromium levels were inversely associated with MetS in Chinese adults. The association may be explained by the relations between plasma chromium levels and high waist circumference, and the triglycerides and blood glucose levels.  aPublisher supplied data  a81803239cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a81820108027cMajor International Joint Research Programme  a2019kfyXMBZ050cFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities 3aadults 3aage 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3ablood glucose 3acase-control studies 3achromium 3aconfidence interval 3adiabetes 3ahumans 3ainsulin resistance 3ametabolic syndrome 3anutrition 3aodds ratio 3apopulation 3atriacylglycerols 3awaist circumference1 aZhou, Li1 aGuo, Qianqian1 aFang, Can1 aWang, Mengke1 aPeng, Xiaobo1 aYin, Jiawei1 aLi, Shuzhen1 aZhu, Yalun1 aYang, Wei1 aZhang, Yan1 aShan, Zhilei1 aChen, Xiaoyi1 aLiu, Liegang0 tNutrition journal.g2020 Dec., v. 19, no. 1 p.107-107dBioMed CentralwJournal:2170x1475-28917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12937-020-00625-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02983naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100005600138245015000194300001600344500002000360520150400380592002801884596013001912596004802042650002302090650002202113650001402135650002002149650001502169650002102184650001702205650002002222650002202242650002902264650001802293651001002311700001902321700001702340773012202357856007302479852000902552655001202561IND60786025320221119013746.0220802e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078602532DNAL7 a10.1002/pca.31342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiang, Zheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1158-533713aAn integrated chemical analysis and network pharmacology approach to identify quality markers of Actinidia eriantha Benth radix on gastric cancer  ap. 851-868.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aINTRODUCTION: Actinidia eriantha Benth radix (AEBR) is one of the most commonly used medicines by the She people in China, used primarily for the treatment of tumours of the digestive tract. There is currently limited to no data on the quality control of AEBR. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to identify quality markers of AEBR. MATERIAL AND METHODS: An ultra‐performance lquid chromatography quadrupole time‐of‐flight mass spectrometry (UPLC‐QTOF‐MS) method was used to identify and analyse the components of AEBR from water extracts. An ultra‐performance liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC–MS/MS) method was also established for the simultaneous determination of 13 active components in the water extracts. The network pharmacology method was used to screen for quality markers of AEBR in gastric cancer. RESULTS: This study tentatively identified 199 chemical constituents and isomers, including 67 pentacyclic triterpenoids, 20 flavonoids, 39 phenolic acids, 18 coumarins, and other compounds. The 13 active components in the water extracts were successfully determined using a validated UPLC–MS/MS method. Based on the network pharmacology method, four compounds were selected as quality markers of AEBR. CONCLUSION: This study provides an important reference for the quality control of AEBR. Chemical analysis combined with network pharmacology provides an effective strategy for the discovery of quality markers in traditional Chinese/herb medicine.  aPublisher supplied data  a2017ZX09101001–007cNational Major Scientific and Technological Special Project for “Significant New Drugs Development”  a7194337cBeijing Natural Science Foundation 3aActinidia eriantha 3achemical analysis 3acoumarins 3adigestive tract 3aflavonoids 3aherbal medicines 3apharmacology 3aquality control 3astomach neoplasms 3atandem mass spectrometry 3atriterpenoids 3aChina1 aChen, Yuanyuan1 aQiu, Jieying0 tPhytochemical analysis.g2022 Aug., v. 33, no. 6 p.851-868dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl58272x0958-03447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/pca.31343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02461naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002200125024001900147040001800166100001600184245012500200300001800325506007600343520014000419520112100559592002801680506003701708650001701745650001201762650001501774650001801789650001401807700001601821700002501837700002401862773011501886856007702001852000902078655001202087IND60172064320221207124547.0150602e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017206432DNAL7 a10.1104/pp.114.2500842doi7 aPMC42568532pmcid7 a253043182pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaha, Sudip10aIntracellular Catalytic Domain of Symbiosis Receptor Kinase Hyperactivates Spontaneous Nodulation in Absence of Rhizobia  ap. 1699-1708.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aConstitutive activity of the intracellular kinase domain of symbiosis receptor kinase hyperactivates nodule organogenesis in a legume .  aSymbiosis Receptor Kinase (SYMRK), a member of the Nod factor signaling pathway, is indispensible for both nodule organogenesis and intracellular colonization of symbionts in rhizobia-legume symbiosis. Here, we show that the intracellular kinase domain of a SYMRK (SYMRK-kd) but not its inactive or full-length version leads to hyperactivation of the nodule organogenic program in Medicago truncatula TR25 ( symrk knockout mutant) in the absence of rhizobia. Spontaneous nodulation in TR25/SYMRK-kd was 6-fold higher than rhizobia-induced nodulation in TR25/SYMRK roots. The merged clusters of spontaneous nodules indicated that TR25 roots in the presence of SYMRK-kd have overcome the control over both nodule numbers and their spatial position. In the presence of rhizobia, SYMRK-kd could rescue the epidermal infection processes in TR25, but colonization of symbionts in the nodule interior was significantly compromised. In summary, ligand-independent deregulated activation of SYMRK hyperactivates nodule organogenesis in the absence of rhizobia, but its ectodomain is required for proper symbiont colonization.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aactive sites 3alegumes 3anodulation 3aorganogenesis 3asymbiosis1 aDutta, Ayan1 aBhattacharya, Avisek1 aDasGupta, Maitrayee0 tPlant physiology.g2014 Dec., v. 166, no. 4 p.1699-1708dAmerican Society of Plant Biologistsx0032-08897nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1104/pp.114.2500843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02743naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001700145245010400162500001900266520145900285592002801744650001501772650001701787650001501804650002101819650001901840650002301859650001001882650001301892650001201905650001501917650001301932650001401945700001701959700002001976700002001996700001902016700001402035700002002049700001902069773012102088856007902209852000902288655001202297IND60735086720221120215727.0210423e20210407xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073508672DNAL7 a10.3390/biology100403072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTang, Li-Bo 10aExosomal microRNAs: Pleiotropic Impacts on Breast Cancer Metastasis and Their Clinical Perspectives  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAs a major threat factor for female health, breast cancer (BC) has garnered a lot of attention for its malignancy and diverse molecules participating in its carcinogenesis process. Among these complex carcinogenesis processes, cell proliferation, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET), and angiogenesis are the major causes for the occurrence of metastasis and chemoresistance which account for cancer malignancy. MicroRNAs packaged and secreted in exosomes are termed “exosomal microRNAs (miRNAs)”. Nowadays, more researches have uncovered the roles of exosomal miRNAs played in BC metastasis. In this review, we recapitulated the dual actions of exosomal miRNAs exerted in the aggressiveness of BC by influencing migration, invasion, and distant metastasis. Next, we presented how exosomal miRNAs modify angiogenesis and stemness maintenance. Clinically, several exosomal miRNAs can govern the transformation between drug sensitivity and chemoresistance. Since the balance of the number and type of exosomal miRNAs is disturbed in pathological conditions, they are able to serve as instructive biomarkers for BC diagnosis and prognosis. More efforts are needed to connect the theoretical studies and clinical traits together. This review provides an outline of the pleiotropic impacts of exosomal miRNAs on BC metastasis and their clinical implications, paving the way for future personalized drugs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaggression 3aangiogenesis 3abiomarkers 3abreast neoplasms 3acarcinogenesis 3acell proliferation 3adrugs 3aexosomes 3afemales 3ametastasis 3amicroRNA 3aprognosis1 aMa, Shu-Xin 1 aChen, Zhuo-Hui 1 aHuang, Qi-Yuan 1 aWu, Long-Yuan 1 aWang, Yi 1 aZhao, Rui-Chen 1 aXiong, Li-Xia 0 tBiology.g2021 Apr. 07, v. 10, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21557x2079-77377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/biology100403073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03154naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100005500138245015700193300001600350500002000366520176600386592002802152650004402180650002202224650001802246650001502264650001702279650002202296650001402318650001102332650001302343650002302356650001302379650001902392650001102411700005602422700006202478773012202540856007302662852000902735655001202744IND60786025420221119013805.0220802e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078602542DNAL7 a10.1002/pca.31452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIsik, Birol1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9323-378012aA comparative study of surface properties of Urtica dioica (nettle) leaves, roots, and seeds and examination of their ability to separate xylene isomers  ap. 886-894.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aINTRODUCTION: Urtica dioica (nettle) is a plant species of the Urticaceae family that grows in various parts of the world and exerts antioxidant, antibacterial, antiulcer, antiviral, and anti‐inflammatory effects. Their leaves, roots, and seeds are used in various fields such as food, medicine, and cosmetics. OBJECTIVES: Inverse gas chromatography (IGC) was used to evaluate the surface characteristics and separation ability of U. dioica leaves, roots, and seeds. Characterization of these biomasses was performed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analyses. METHODOLOGY: The surface properties of the biomasses including dispersive surface energy, adsorption enthalpy, Gibbs free energy, and acidity‐basicity constants were determined at infinite dilution using various organic solvents. These properties were compared with each other. Dispersive surface energies were calculated using the Dorris–Gray, Donnet–Park, and Schultz methods. The accuracy of these methods and their applicability were evaluated. In the last stage of this study, the separation of xylene isomers was investigated by using U. dioica biomasses as stationary phases. RESULTS: The surface functional groups were determined by FTIR analysis. As a result of the IGC studies, it was found that the adsorption of polar solvents on biomasses occurred exothermically and spontaneously. Besides, it was found that the surfaces of biomasses were basic. From the retention diagrams and selectivity coefficients, it was determined that xylene isomers were effectively separated. CONCLUSION: IGC is a promising, low‐cost, easy‐to‐apply, and high‐accuracy technique for the investigation of the surface properties of biomasses and their ability to separate isomers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aGibbs free energy 3aUrtica dioica 3aadsorption 3aantioxidants 3acomparative study 3acosmetics 3aenergy 3aenthalpy 3agas chromatography 3amedicine 3aphytochemicals 3axylene1 aCakar, Fatih1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6192-13701 aCankurtaran, Ozlem1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8383-11700 tPhytochemical analysis.g2022 Aug., v. 33, no. 6 p.886-894dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl58272x0958-03447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/pca.31453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02790naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002600145245013300171500001900304520165000323592002801973650002302001650001802024650002702042650001502069650001402084650001702098650001502115650000902130650002102139650001802160650001402178700002702192773012102219856007902340852000902419655001202428IND60735086920221120211117.0210423e20210408xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073508692DNAL7 a10.3390/biology100403092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGanie, Showkat  Ahmad10aStress-Induced Changes in Alternative Splicing Landscape in Rice: Functional Significance of Splice Isoforms in Stress Tolerance  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aImprovements in yield and quality of rice are crucial for global food security. However, global rice production is substantially hindered by various biotic and abiotic stresses. Making further improvements in rice yield is a major challenge to the rice research community, which can be accomplished through developing abiotic stress-resilient rice varieties and engineering durable agrochemical-independent pathogen resistance in high-yielding elite rice varieties. This, in turn, needs increased understanding of the mechanisms by which stresses affect rice growth and development. Alternative splicing (AS), a post-transcriptional gene regulatory mechanism, allows rapid changes in the transcriptome and can generate novel regulatory mechanisms to confer plasticity to plant growth and development. Mounting evidence indicates that AS has a prominent role in regulating rice growth and development under stress conditions. Several regulatory and structural genes and splicing factors of rice undergo different types of stress-induced AS events, and the functional significance of some of them in stress tolerance has been defined. Both rice and its pathogens use this complex regulatory mechanism to devise strategies against each other. This review covers the current understanding and evidence for the involvement of AS in biotic and abiotic stress-responsive genes, and its relevance to rice growth and development. Furthermore, we discuss implications of AS for the virulence of different rice pathogens and highlight the areas of further research and potential future avenues to develop climate-smart and disease-resistant rice varieties.  aPublisher supplied data 3adisease resistance 3afood security 3agrowth and development 3alandscapes 3apathogens 3aplant growth 3aplasticity 3arice 3astress tolerance 3atranscriptome 3avirulence1 aReddy, Anireddy S.

We reviewed the literature with the aim of assessing the oncological safety of nipple-sparing mastectomy (NSM) as a risk-reduction procedure in BRCA-mutated patients. Nine studies reporting on the incidence of primary breast cancer post NSM in asymptomatic BRCA mutated patients undergoing risk-reducing bilateral procedures met the inclusion criteria. NSM appears to be a safe option for BRCA mutation carriers from an oncological point of view, with low reported rates of new breast cancers, low rates of postoperative complications, and high levels of satisfaction and postoperative quality of life. However, larger multi-institutional studies with longer follow-up are needed to establish this procedure as the best surgical option in this setting.  aPublisher supplied data 3abreast neoplasms 3abreasts 3agenes 3amutation 3aquality of life 3arisk reduction1 aMontagna, Giacomo 1 aCriscitiello, Carmen 1 aNava, Maurizio  Bruno1 aPrivitera, Francesca 1 aTaher, Wafa 1 aGloria, Antonio 1 aCatanuto, Giuseppe 0 tGenes.g2021 Feb. 10, v. 12, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27140x2073-44257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/genes120202533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02481naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001900146245007900165506002800244520130200272592002801574506003701602650002101639650001001660650001201670650001701682650001601699650001001715650001301725650001201738651001401750653000901764653001501773653001201788653002901800653002901829773013501858856008101993852000902074655001202083IND60774245920221207064316.0170905e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077424592DNAL7 a10.17969/jtipi.v5i2.10022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMuzaifa, Murna10aPerubahan Karakteristik Fisik Belimbing Wuluh selama Fermentasi Asam Sunti  aResource is Open Access  aAsam sunti is a product of bilimbi (Averrhoa bilimbi L.) fermentation, traditional ingredient from Nanggroe Aceh Darussalam, used as flavor, particularly to provide sour taste and specific aroma in Acehnese cuisine. Scientific studies of asam sunti are relatively limited, while study of change on physical and chemical characteristics of asam sunti does not exist. The objective of this research was to study the change of physical characteristics of bilimbi during fermentation. This study used explorative laboratory design. Asam sunti was produced in laboratory scale with three times repetition and sample was taken three times in stages, i.e., before sun-drying and salting (stage 1), after repeated sun-drying and salting (stage 2), and fermentation for 1 month (stage 3). Parameters analyzed on physic characteristics included aw, texture and color. Significant change on physic characteristics were found during the processing of bilimbi to become asam sunti. The value of aw of the bilimbi was found to decrease after processing (sun-drying and salting) and fermentation for 1 month. Texture of the bilimbi increased at stage 2 and decreased at the last of fermentation. The colour of the bilimbi changed from green to brown after the whole processing (salting, drying and fermentation).  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAverrhoa bilimbi 3acolor 3acuisine 3afermentation 3aingredients 3aodors 3asourness 3atexture 3aIndonesia 0aaceh 0aasam sunti 0abilimbi 0aphysical characteristics 0atraditional fermentation0 tJurnal Teknologi dan Industri Pertanian Indonesia.g2013 June, v. 5, no. 2dSyiah Kuala UniversitywJournal:27805x2442-70207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17969/jtipi.v5i2.10023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03347naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002900149245010800178500001900286520184700305592002802152650002902180650001202209650002402221650001002245650001302255650003002268650001202298650002202310650001102332650002502343650001902368650001902387650001402406650001502420650001202435651001102447653002102458653001602479653001102495653001702506653002002523653001902543700003102562700002802593700002602621773008902647856008402736852000902820655001202829IND60730096420221119033536.0210423e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073009642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.flora.2021.1517972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJimenez-Torres, Jesus A.10aPhysiological and biochemical responses of Agave to temperature and climate of their native environment  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe assessment of phenotypic variation across populations can help to select genotypes that are potentially resistant to the ongoing and predicted climatic variations. Phenotypic variation is expressed as morphological, physiological, or metabolic changes in response to environmental factors. Agave mapisaga and A. salmiana populations exhibit morphological variation regarding their geographical distribution and due to intense anthropogenic influence. This study aimed to identify metabolic traits in young plants of A. mapisaga and A. salmiana, involved in plant resistance to temperature stress, which can help to understand differences between provenances and between species. Agave plants propagated from four seed origins, collected from three “pulque” (a fermented beverage) production areas in the state of Hidalgo, Mexico, were assessed. Four-month-old plants of each seed origin (species*provenance) were maintained during one month in growth chambers, at day/night temperature (T) regimes for 12/12 h: (1) 25/25T, (2) 25/15T, and (3) 25/15 plus 45 °C T for 4 h between 11 am and 3 pm (45T). The plant dry biomass, maximum quantum efficiency of PSII photochemistry (Fv/Fm), total free amino acids (TFAA), total free phenol (TFP), and free soluble sugar concentrations were measured. Minimum values for dry biomass, TFP, glucose, and sucrose concentrations occurred in the 25/25T regime. Plant biomass, and TFAA and glucose concentrations were differently affected by seed provenances; but Fv/Fm rate, or the TFP, fructose, and sucrose concentrations had no relation to seed provenance. Moderate high night temperatures drastically affected the growth and metabolism of A. mapisaga and A. salmiana. In conclusion, the response to different temperature stress treatments depends partly on species, but less on seed provenance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropogenic activities 3aclimate 3afermented beverages 3aflora 3afructose 3ageographical distribution 3aglucose 3anight temperature 3aphenol 3aphenotypic variation 3aphotochemistry 3aphotosystem II 3aphytomass 3aprovenance 3asucrose 3aMexico 0aFree amino acids 0aHeat stress 0aMaguey 0aPlant growth 0aSeed provenance 0aSoluble sugars1 aPeña-Valdivia, Cecilia B.1 aPadilla-Chacón, Daniel1 aGarcía-Nava, Rodolfo0 tFlora.g2021 May, v. 278 p.151797-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl51878x0367-25307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.flora.2021.1517973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02361naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245010200167300001600269520092300285592002801208650004401236650002201280650002501302650001401327650002201341650001401363650001301377650003401390650001401424650002001438650001301458650003301471650001601504650001601520650002101536650001101557653002001568653001801588653001301606653002501619653002401644700002001668773009701688856008501785852000901870655001201879IND60597540520221121052637.0190705e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059754052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2018.05.0482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGoli, Jibril10aDevelopment of heterogeneous alkali catalyst from waste chicken eggshell for biodiesel production  ap. 142-154.  aIn this research work, heterogeneous alkali catalyst was derived from low-cost chicken eggshell waste.

In conclusion, these results indicate that the variety ‘Sevillana’ has greater capacity than water ‘Frantoio’ to withstand arid environments.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aOlea europaea 3acultivars 3aolives 3awater content 0awater index 0aLeave 0aFrantoio 0aSevillana1 aRebaza, Diana1 aJulca, Alberto0 tScientia agropecuaria.g2015 Sept., v. 6, no. 3 p.147-154dUniversidad Nacional de TrujillowJournal:27801x2306-67417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17268/sci.agropecu.2015.03.013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03212naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245011700167520187800284592002802162650001302190650002002203650002002223650002702243650001502270650001102285650002602296650001102322650001202333653003702345653002402382653003602406653003702442653000802479653000802487653001102495700001602506700001302522700001702535700001902552773010102571856008502672852000902757655001202766IND60731531020221120091518.0210723e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073153102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoinf.2021.1012782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPi, Weiqiang10a3D-CNN based UAV hyperspectral imagery for grassland degradation indicator ground object classification research  aThe identification and counting of grassland degradation indicator ground objects is an important component of grassland ecological monitoring. These steps are also an important basis for developing ecological restoration and management programs for degraded grasslands. Compared with a traditional human survey, the use of remote sensing images can not only achieve dynamic monitoring of a large area, but also improve the efficiency. Recently, most studies regarding ground object classification based on remote sensing images address the development and optimization of classification models for features in several widely used datasets. For the remote sensing of desertified grasslands, remote sensing images with high spatial resolutions are used for studies on small and sparse features in degraded grasslands. The spatial resolution of the above mentioned datasets yields difficulties when attempting to classify small and sparse indicator features for desertified grasslands because generalization becomes limited. Therefore, establishing a lightweight classification model suitable for degraded grassland features with high spatial resolution is important. In this study, a low altitude unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) hyperspectral remote sensing platform was constructed to collect high spatial resolution remote sensing images of degraded grasslands. The GDIF-3D-CNN classification model was used to classify the pure pixels and all pixels datasets, whose accuracy and efficiency were further improved by optimizing the eight parameters of the model. This study explores the remote sensing ground object classification of thin small plants and a large number of mixed pixels, realizing high precision classification among desertification degradation indicating plant populations of a species, and provides key quantitative data for grassland degradation research.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaltitude 3adata collection 3adesertification 3aecological restoration 3agrasslands 3ahumans 3ahyperspectral imagery 3amodels 3asurveys 0a3D convolutional neural networks 0aDegraded grasslands 0aPlant population classification 0aUAV hyperspectral remote sensing 0aUAV 0aHSI 0aAVIRIS1 aDu, Jianmin1 aBi, Yuge1 aGao, Xinchao1 aZhu, Xiangbing0 tEcological informatics.g2021 May, v. 62 p.101278-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:2190x1574-95417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2021.1012783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03250naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002300138245011200161500001900273500002000292520197800312592002802290596002502318596006102343596004702404650001102451650000902462650002602471650001402497650001502511650001302526650001502539650001402554650002102568650001802589700002102607700002202628773010902650856007202759852000902831655001202840IND60708974720221120182935.0200902e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070897472DNAL7 a10.1002/ecy.31002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAtkinson, Carla L.10aEvolutionary history drives aspects of stoichiometric niche variation and functional effects within a guild  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aFunctional traits are characteristics of an organism that represents how it interacts with its environment and can influence the structure and function of ecosystems. Ecological stoichiometry provides a framework to understand ecosystem structure and function by modeling the coupled flow of elements (e.g. carbon [C], nitrogen [N], phosphorus [P]) between consumers and their environment. Animals tend to be homeostatic in their nutrient requirements and preferentially sequester the element in shortest supply relative to demand, and release relatively more of the element in excess. Tissue stoichiometry is an important functional trait that allows for predictions among the elemental composition of animals, their diet, and their waste products, with important effects on the cycling and availability of nutrients in ecosystems. Here, we examined the tissue stoichiometric niches (C:N:P) and nutrient recycling stoichiometries (N:P) of several filter‐feeding freshwater mussels in the subfamily Ambleminae. Despite occupying the same functional‐feeding group and being restricted to a single subfamily‐level radiation, we found that species occupied distinct stoichiometric niches and that these niches varied, in part, as a function of their evolutionary history. The relationship between phylogenetic divergence and functional divergence suggests that evolutionary processes may be shaping niche complementarity and resource partitioning. Tissue and excretion stoichiometry were negatively correlated as predicted by stoichiometric theory. When scaled to the community, higher species richness and phylogenetic diversity resulted in greater functional evenness and reduced functional dispersion. Filter‐feeding bivalves are an ecologically important guild in freshwater ecosystems globally, and our study provides a more nuanced view of the stoichiometric niches and ecological functions performed by this phylogenetically and ecologically diverse assemblage.  aPublisher supplied data  cWeyerhaeuser Company  cAlabama Department of Natural Resources and Conservation  aDEB‐1831512cNational Science Foundation 3acarbon 3adiet 3aelemental composition 3aexcretion 3afreshwater 3anitrogen 3aphosphorus 3aphylogeny 3aspecies richness 3astoichiometry1 avan Ee, Brian C.1 aPfeiffer, John M.0 tEcology.g2020 Sept., v. 101, no. 9 p.e03100-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl46164x0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecy.31003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03346naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245012100171300001600292520111600308536080901424592002802233596001802261650002502279650001502304650001202319650001802331650002302349651001502372653002602387653002802413653004002441653002602481653004202507700002802549700002002577700002402597700002202621700002202643700002402665773011602689856008602805852000902891655001202900IND60747234820221119004954.0210816e20210703xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074723482DNAL7 a10.1080/08941920.2021.19009632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPierce, Gregory10aEnvironmental Attitudes and Knowledge: Do They Matter for Support and Investment in Local Stormwater Infrastructure?  ap. 885-905.  aStormwater infrastructure substantially impacts water quality and supply. In the U.S., local agency investments rely on public support from taxes or fees. Assessing individuals’ knowledge and willingness to pay helps inform potential pathways to funding and green infrastructure implementation. Using a 2018–2019 survey of 868 University of California students and staff, we analyze stormwater knowledge and willingness to pay or support public fund allocation for green infrastructure, especially natural treatment systems (NTS). Results of three separate regression models, each with a one-campus random sample and an all-campus convenience sample, show the majority of respondents supported allocating personal and campus funds for NTS. Preexisting environmental attitudes (on the New Ecological Paradigm scale) were the most common driver in nearly all models, but with inconsistent results and low explanatory power across models. Harnessing public support to increase stormwater investment may require tailored benefit messaging or other motivational frameworks, particularly in semiarid environments.  aThis work was funded by the University of California Office of the President Multicampus Research Programs and Initiatives [Grant ID MRP-17-455083]. Campuses are more constrained than cities in funding stormwater infrastructure because they cannot levy taxes on residents, but they can levy fees on students; understanding support for fees can inform the viability of this funding stream for stormwater infrastructure. Students have opinions that can influence university development and funding decisions, despite the current lack of transparency or opportunities for meaningful student involvement (as found in). While staff could support campus infrastructure financing through paycheck deductions, student fees are the most direct campus funding source akin to municipal fees or utility user charges.  aPublisher supplied data  aMRP-17-455083 3agreen infrastructure 3astormwater 3asurveys 3awater quality 3awillingness to pay 3aCalifornia 0aCampus sustainability 0aenvironmental knowledge 0aNew Ecological Paradigm (NEP) scale 0astormwater management 0awillingness to pay and public support1 aGmoser-Daskalakis, Kyra1 aRippy, Megan A.1 aHolden, Patricia A.1 aGrant, Stanley B.1 aFeldman, David L.1 aAmbrose, Richard F.0 tSociety & natural resources.g2021 July 3, v. 34, no. 7 p.885-905dRoutledgewJournal:jnl45063x1521-07237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08941920.2021.19009633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03217naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100001900181245004000200300001800240500001500258506007600273520182100349592002802170506003702198650002902235650002202264650002102286650001402307650002502321650001002346650001302356650001802369650001002387653003302397653001702430653001102447653001602458653001202474653001902486653002502505700002502530773009702555856007402652852000902726655001202735IND60117786420221207122358.0141126s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011778642DNAL7 a10.1093/gbe/evt1942doi7 aPMC38799802pmcid7 a242810492pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLake, James A.14aThe Deep Roots of the Rings of Life  ap. 2440-2448.  a2019-12-04  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aReconstructing early evolutionary events like the origins of informational and operational genes, membranes, and photophosphorylation is difficult because early evolutionary events can be masked by subsequent gene flows. Furthermore, as evolution progresses through both Darwinian survival of the fittest (tree-like evolution) and symbiotic/endosymbiotic cooperation (ring-like evolution), trees alone are not adequate to represent Earth’s evolutionary history. Here, we reconstruct and root the New Rings of Life and use it as a framework for interpreting early events in the evolution of life. Unlike the three-domain hypothesis, the rings do not fit all life into one of three immutable categories, but rather accommodate new gene flows as novel organisms are discovered. A draft of the Rooted Rings of Life is reconstructed by analyzing the phylogenetic distributions of indels (insertions/deletions) and genes coding for fundamental molecular processes. Their phylogenetic distributions are inconsistent with all trees. Hypergeometric distribution analyses of them strongly localize the root of the rings to a segment of the deepest ring (P < 10−21 and P < 10−194), and whole-genome analyses independently confirm the topology of the rooted rings (P < 7.1 × 10−6). The rings identify several large gene flows, including a flow of a thousand genes into the Halobacteria and the Eubacteria, the related photocyte flow, the flow of genes into the last common ancestor of the eocytes and the eukaryotes, and the informational and operational gene flows into the eukaryotes. The rooted rings also chronologically order steps in the evolution of extant taxa, that is, phototrophy evolved from Halobacteria (photophosphorylation) → Heliobacteria (photosynthesis) → Cyanobacteria (oxygenic photosynthesis).  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aprobability distribution 3aHeliobacteriaceae 3aeukaryotic cells 3aphylogeny 3aphotophosphorylation 3agenes 3atopology 3aCyanobacteria 3aroots 0ahypergeometric distributions 0aether lipids 0aindels 0asporulation 0agenomes 0aphotosynthesis 0aHeliobacterium group1 aSinsheimer, Janet S.0 tGenome biology and evolution.g2013, v. 5, no. 12 p.2440-2448dOxford University Press7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/gbe/evt1943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02368naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245012000165300001600285520119000301592002801491650002501519650001201544650001801556650001801574650002001592650001201612650001701624700002101641700002001662700001401682700005601696700005301752773010901805856008301914852000901997655001202006IND60736028520221122093430.0210707e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073602852DNAL7 a10.1007/s12250-020-00286-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCao, Junyuan10aCharacterizing the Lassa Virus Envelope Glycoprotein Membrane Proximal External Region for Its Role in Fusogenicity  ap. 273-280.  aThe membrane-proximal external region (MPER) of Lassa virus (LASV) glycoprotein complex (GPC) is critical in modulating its functionality. Till now, the high-resolution structure of the intact GPC, including MPER is not available. In this study, we used alanine substitution to scan all 16 residues located in LASV MPER. Western blotting and quantification fusion assay showed that the residues located at the C terminus of the HR2 (M414 and L415) and N terminus of the MPER (K417 and Y419) are critical for GPC-mediated membrane fusion function. Furthermore, cell surface biotinylation experiments revealed that M414A, K417A and Y419A expressed similar levels as WT, whereas L415A mutant led to a reduction of mature GPC on the cell surface. Moreover, substitution of these residues with the similar residue such as M414L, L415I, K417R and Y419F would partly compensate the loss of the fusion activity caused by the alanine mutant in these sites. Results from this study showed that several key residues in the MPER region are indispensable to promote the conformational changes that drive fusion events and shed light on the structure analysis of LASV GPC and anti-LASV therapeutics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLassa mammarenavirus 3aalanine 3abiotinylation 3aglycoproteins 3amembrane fusion 3amutants 3atherapeutics1 aZhang, Guangshun1 aChang, Min-min,1 aLiu, Yang1 aXiao, Gengfu1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9401-235X1 aWang, Wei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8696-97730 tVirologica Sinica.g2021 Apr., v. 36, no. 2 p.273-280dSpringer SingaporewJournal:1429x1674-07697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12250-020-00286-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02965naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245013400172300001400306520173200320592002802052650001202080650001302092650001702105650001902122650001102141650001202152650001202164650002102176650000902197650001302206700002802219700002302247700002202270700002302292700003102315700003202346773008702378856008102465852000902546655001202555IND50069831020221119154720.0150209e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006983102DNAL7 a10.1007/s00035-013-0122-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aElumeeva, Tatiana G.10aLong-term vegetation dynamic in the Northwestern Caucasus: which communities are more affected by upward shifts of plant species?  ap. 77-85.  aWe studied long-term (25–31 years) dynamics of alpine communities at the Teberda Reserve, NW Caucasus, Russia, to test the following hypotheses: (1) lower altitude species increase and high altitude species decrease their abundance as a consequence of climate warming; (2) such changes in abundance are more significant in communities with short growth season (due to persistent snow cover) compared to exposed communities; (3) species with similar changes in abundance have similar functional traits. Four alpine communities with different positions in relief were considered in order of winter snow cover: alpine lichen heaths (ALH), Festuca varia grasslands (FVG), Geranium-Hedysarum meadows (GHM), and snowbed communities (SBC).The altitudinal distribution of species significantly predicted the direction and degree of changes in species abundance in GHM (p < 0.001), SBC (p < 0.02) and FVG (p < 0.05) with high altitude species decreasing and low altitude species increasing their abundance. Mean altitudes of significantly decreasing species exceeded that of increasing species by ca. 100–130 m in FVG, GHM and SBC. There were no species traits or trait combinations that consistently predicted their changing abundance in ALH, FVG and SBC. In GHM increasing species tended to have leaves with higher SLA (i.e. softer leaves) and lower root nitrogen content. The observed dynamic processes may be caused partly by recent climate warming, although slow recovery from historic grazing pressure may also play a role. Regardless of the causes driving the plant species’ upward shift, communities experiencing high snow accumulation (SBC, GHM) seem to be more vulnerable to changes in structure and composition.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFestuca 3aaltitude 3abiogeography 3aglobal warming 3aleaves 3alichens 3ameadows 3anitrogen content 3asnow 3asnowpack1 aOnipchenko, Vladimir G.1 aEgorov, Aleksey V.1 aKhubiev, Anzor B.1 aTekeev, Dzhamal K.1 aSoudzilovskaia, Nadejda A.1 aCornelissen, Johannes H.

However, our understanding of how variable species interactions affect food‐web structure and stability is still in its infancy. Anthropogenic stress, such as acid mine drainage, is likely to place severe limitations on the food‐web structures availabe, due to changes in community composition and body mass distributions. Here, we used mechanistic models to infer food‐web structure and quantify stability in streams across a gradient of acid mine drainage. Multiple food webs were iterated for each community based on species pairwise interaction probabilities, in order to incorporate the variability of realistic food‐web structure. We found that food‐web structure was altered systematically with a 32‐fold decrease in the number of links and a twofold increase in connectance across the gradient. Stability generally increased sixfold with increasing acid mine drainage stress, regardless of how interaction strengths were estimated. However, the distribution of the stability measure, s, for some impacted communities separated into clusters of higher and lower magnitude depending on how interaction strengths were estimated. Management and restoration of impacted sites needs to consider their increased stability, as this may have important implications for the recolonization of desirable species. Furthermore, active species introductions may be required to overcome the internal ecological inertia of affected communities.  aPublisher supplied data  aCLRE 1202cMinistry of Business, Innovation and Employment 3aacid mine drainage 3aanthropogenic activities 3abody weight 3acommunity structure 3astreams 3atopology1 aWesner, Jeff S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6058-79721 aHarding, Jon S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1070-15940 tEcology.g2020 Sept., v. 101, no. 9 p.e03102-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl46164x0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecy.31023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02276naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002900151245018400180300001600364520104900380592002801429650001201457650001401469650001501483650002201498650001101520650001401531650001101545651001201556653001401568653002201582653002401604653001701628700001601645700001801661773011601679856008601795852000901881655001201890IND60747235020221119004823.0210816e20210703xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074723502DNAL7 a10.1080/08941920.2021.19059172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrammatikopoulou, Ioanna10aRelationship Between Value Orientations, Attitudes, and Behavioral Intentions Regarding Peatland Conservation in Finland: An Empirical Application of the Cognitive Hierarchy Model  ap. 943-965.  aPeatland conservation is an emerging issue considering the number of ecosystem services these ecosystems provide at the global as well as the local level. Here, we examine how people in Finland value peatlands and how these values are associated with their attitudes toward the ecosystem services that peatlands provide, conservation policy, and their behavioral intention to contribute to conservation. To this end, we use the cognitive hierarchy and employ a protection–use orientation approach. We conclude with four classes of orientation, i.e. conservationists, utilitarians, pluralists, and distanced. The mean values of attitudes and behavioral intentions to a large extent differ significantly across the value orientation classes. The cognitive hierarchy and the notion of value orientations provide a more profound angle of the underlying reasons for people’s views regarding conservation. The findings are context specific but have broader relevance considering the significant role of peatlands in regulating the global climate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3acognition 3aecosystems 3aissues and policy 3amodels 3apeatlands 3apeople 3aFinland 0aAttitudes 0achoice experiment 0acognitive hierarchy 0aconservation1 aEija, Pouta1 aJanne, Artell0 tSociety & natural resources.g2021 July 3, v. 34, no. 7 p.943-965dRoutledgewJournal:jnl45063x1521-07237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08941920.2021.19059173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02163naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245013500166300001600301520115400317592002801471596001301499650001101512650001901523650001901542650001901561650002901580650001101609700001801620773011601638856008601754852000901840655001201849IND60767395220221117224002.0220216e20220304xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076739522DNAL7 a10.1080/2150704X.2021.20181422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRen, Yahua10aEstimating the velocity of moving targets in multichannel SAR images by fourier analysis and optimally-weighted velocity averaging  ap. 226-235.  aA scheme is developed to estimate the radial velocities of moving targets in multichannel synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. A moving target generally consists of multiple pixels. First, a radial velocity estimate is obtained from each of these pixels via the spatial Fourier analysis, which is more robust against the clutter than the interferometry method because the target signal and the clutter are separate in the spatial frequency domain. Then, the radial velocity estimate of the moving target is obtained by a weighted averaging of the radial velocity estimates, and the weight of each radial velocity estimate is designed to minimize the mean square error (MSE) between the estimate and the truth. This optimally weighted averaging scheme is also more accurate than the optimally weighted averaging scheme related to the interferometry method, because the weight of each radial velocity estimate is designed according to the intensity of the target signal instead of the intensity of the target signal and the clutter. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is demonstrated by the experimental results of simulated and real SAR data.  aPublisher supplied data  aU2031127 3adesign 3aimage analysis 3ainterferometry 3aremote sensing 3asynthetic aperture radar 3aweight1 aWang, Junfeng0 tRemote sensing letters.g2022 Mar. 04, v. 13, no. 3 p.226-235dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12304x2150-70587nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/2150704X.2021.20181423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02114naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245011500174300001600289520103400305592002801339650002101367650001301388650002201401650002401423650002401447650001601471650001901487650000901506700001901515700002301534773008901557856008601646990002301732852000901755655001201764IND60092004620221118033901.0141103e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009200462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.buildenv.2011.10.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCaciolo, Marcello10aNumerical simulation of single-sided ventilation using RANS and LES and comparison with full-scale experiments  ap. 202-213.  aSingle-sided natural ventilation is a simple and energy-efficient method to passively cool a building, thus reducing or avoiding air-conditioning use. CFD has the potential to give detailed information about the complex flow generated by the interaction of buoyancy and wind in single-sided ventilation. In this paper, three experiments on single-sided ventilation are reproduced by CFD, using two turbulence models (RANS and LES). A detailed description of the experimental set-up, the numerical methods and the comparison method between experiments and simulations are provided. Results from RANS and LES are compared to experiments in terms of average and turbulent flow field, local airspeed, turbulence and temperature at the opening and airflow rates. The comparison shows that LES has the potential to provide more accurate results than RANS in most of the cases, capturing better the turbulent characteristics of the flow. However, the computational cost of LES is at least an order of magnitude higher than that of RANS.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair conditioning 3aair flow 3aenergy efficiency 3amathematical models 3anatural ventilation 3atemperature 3aturbulent flow 3awind1 aStabat, Pascal1 aMarchio, Dominique0 tBuilding and environment.g2012 Apr., v. 50 p.202-213dElsevier Ltdx0360-13237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2011.10.0173Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle04958naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245017500165300001200340520313100352592002803483650001603511650001903527650002403546650001603570650001703586650001403603650001003617650001303627650004603640650002703686650003103713650001003744650002103754650001703775650001303792650001803805650001203823650001403835650001703849650001903866650002203885650002403907650003503931650002903966650002003995700001804015700001704033700001204050700001804062700001804080700001704098700001804115700001404133773010504147856008304252852000904335655001204344IND60736028720221122093450.0220621e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073602872DNAL7 a10.1186/s12870-021-02978-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Zhaoxia10aComparative transcriptomic analysis reveals the regulatory mechanism of the gibberellic acid pathway of Tartary buckwheat (Fagopyrum tataricum (L.) Gaertn.) dwarf mutants  ap. 206.  aBACKGROUND: Tartary buckwheat is an important minor crop species with high nutritional and medicinal value and is widely planted worldwide. Cultivated Tartary buckwheat plants are tall and have hollow stems that lodge easily, which severely affects their yield and hinders the development of the Tartary buckwheat industry. METHODS: Heifeng No. 1 seeds were treated with ethylmethanesulfonate (EMS) to generate a mutant library. The dwarf mutant ftdm was selected from the mutagenized population, and the agronomic characteristics giving rise to the dwarf phenotype were evaluated. Ultra-fast liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (UFLC-ESI–MS/MS) was performed to determine the factors underlying the different phenotypes between the wild-type (WT) and ftdm plants. In addition, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) was performed via the HiSeq 2000 platform, and the resulting transcriptomic data were analysed to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variant analysis revealed possible sites associated with dwarfism. The expression levels of the potential DEGs between the WT and ftdm mutant were then measured via qRT-PCR and fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads (FPKM). RESULT: The plant height (PH) of the ftdm mutant decreased to 42% of that of the WT, and compared with the WT, the mutant and had a higher breaking force (BF) and lower lodging index (LI). Lower GA4 and GA7 contents and higher contents of jasmonic acid (JA), salicylic acid (SA) and brassinolactone (BR) were detected in the stems of the ftdm mutant compared with the WT. Exogenous application of GAs could not revert the dwarfism of the ftdm mutant. On the basis of the transcriptomic analysis, 146 homozygous SNP loci were identified. In total, 12 DEGs with nonsynonymous mutations were ultimately identified, which were considered potential candidate genes related to the dwarf trait. When the sequences of eight genes whose expression was downregulated and four genes whose expression was upregulated were compared, SKIP14, an F-box protein whose sequence is 85% homologous to that of SLY1 in Arabidopsis, presented an amino acid change (from Ser to Asn) and was expressed at a lower level in the stems of the ftdm mutant compared with the WT. Hence, we speculated that this amino acid change in SKIP14 resulted in a disruption in GA signal transduction, indirectly decreasing the GA content and downregulating the expression of genes involved in GA biosynthesis or the GA response. Further studies are needed to determine the molecular basis underlying the dwarf phenotype of the ftdm mutant. CONCLUSION: We report a Tartary buckwheat EMS dwarf mutant, ftdm, suitable for high-density planting and commercial farming. A significant decrease in GA4 and GA7 levels was detected in the ftdm mutant, and 12 DEGs expressed in the stems of the ftdm mutant were selected as candidates of the dwarfing gene. One nonsynonymous mutation was detected in the SKIP14 gene in the ftdm mutant, and this gene had a lower transcript level compared with that in the WT.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3aF-box proteins 3aFagopyrum tataricum 3aamino acids 3abiosynthesis 3abuckwheat 3acrops 3adwarfing 3aelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry 3aethyl methanesulfonate 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3agibberellic acid 3ahomozygosity 3aindustry 3ajasmonic acid 3amutants 3aphenotype 3aplant height 3asalicylic acid 3asequence analysis 3asignal transduction 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3atandem mass spectrometry 3atranscriptomics1 aWang, Xinfang1 aLiu, Ronghua1 aDu, Wei1 aMa, Mingchuan1 aHan, Yuanhuai1 aLi, Hongying1 aLiu, Longlong1 aHou, Siyu0 tBMC plant biology.g2021 Dec., v. 21, no. 1 p.206-206dBioMed CentralwJournal:2167x1471-22297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12870-021-02978-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03427naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245013700170520169000307592002801997650001502025650001902040650001802059650001502077650001502092650002702107650001702134650001402151650001102165650001902176650002502195650001502220650001302235650001302248650001702261650001102278650002002289650001602309650001902325653005502344653006802399653002202467653004102489653002702530653002202557700005702579700002202636700001902658773011402677856008502791852000902876655001202885IND60674801620221118033422.0200210e20200208xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067480162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2019.4606622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGritti, Fabrice10aRetention loss of reversed-phase chromatographic columns using 100% aqueous mobile phases from fundamental insights to best practice  aThis work deals with experimental investigations pertaining to the impact of chemical (electrolyte concentration from 0 to 100 mM, dissolved nitrogen gas from 0 to 6.7 × 10−4 M in water; surface chemistry including hexylphenyl, polyphenyl, C₃₀, C₁₈, and C₈; surface coverage in C₁₈-bonded chains from 1.5 to 3.5 µmol/m²; presence of surface dopant), physical (hydrostatic pressure of water from 50 to 500 bar; temperature from 27 ∘C to 75 ∘C), and structural parameters (average pore size from 50 Å to 400 Å; pore connectivity) on the dewetting kinetics of water from the hydrophobic mesopores of particles packed in RPLC columns. The results are explained from physico-chemical viewpoints involving intrusion and extrusion Laplace pressures, advancing and receding contact angles, surface tension of water, vapor pressure of water, 3D reconstruction of the actual mesoporous structure, pore connectivity, and the hysteresis in nitrogen adsorption and desorption isotherm onto reversed-phase chromatographic materials. A model of water dewetting consistent with the observations and the physical interpretations is then proposed. Finally, the most relevant practical solutions (pressurizing the column in absence of flow, pore size enlargement, using phenyl-bonded phase, polar embedded or surface doped C₁₈-bonded phases, reducing the C₁₈ surface coverage, doping the silica surface, lengthening of the alkyl-bonded chains, applying low temperatures, purging and degassing the mobile phase with helium gas) are suggested in order to eliminate or at least minimize the retention loss of RPLC columns when using fully aqueous mobile phases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3achromatography 3acontact angle 3adeaeration 3adesorption 3adissolved nitrogen gas 3aelectrolytes 3aextrusion 3ahelium 3ahydrophobicity 3ahydrostatic pressure 3ahysteresis 3anitrogen 3aporosity 3aporous media 3asilica 3asurface tension 3atemperature 3avapor pressure 0aRPLC Retention loss with 100% aqueous mobile phase 0aKinetic mechanism of water dewetting from hydrophobic mesopores 0aSurface chemistry 0aHydrostatic pressure and temperature 0aPore size distribution 0aPore connectivity1 aGilar, Martin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1199-12871 aWalter, Thomas H.1 aWyndham, Kevin0 tJournal of chromatography.g2020 Feb. 08, v. 1612 p.460662-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl50504x0021-96737nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2019.4606623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03116naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245011600168300001600284520163900300592002801939650002501967650002001992650001002012650001502022650001902037650001802056650001702074650001502091650002002106650001302126650002002139650002702159653005702186653002802243700002502271700001702296700002002313700001802333700002302351700001802374700002802392700002802420773009202448856008502540852000902625655001202634IND60565882820221119072522.0180905e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056588282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.plgene.2017.03.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, Shweta10aUnderstanding the plant and nanoparticle interface at transcriptomic and proteomic level: A concentric overview  ap. 265-272.  aProgressive research in the field of nano sciences brought prodigious advancement in all aspects of human life. Recently, the application of manufactured nanomaterials is being conceptualized in the field of agronomy and food industry. In the present scenario, nanotechnology has wide variety of applications in agricultural practices. However, nanomaterials are shown to cause toxic and deleterious effects on plants and microbes due to its persistent behavior. There are complicated mechanisms evolved in plants in regulating the uptake, accumulation and mobilization of nanoparticles, yet its impact at genetic level needs to be explored. Since, the part of genome that is functionally translated displays an important role in responding towards plant stress, the clear representation of protein and metabolic networks involved in plant cell detoxification and tolerance is provided by the proteomic studies. The transcriptomic technologies have significantly contributed in deciphering the molecular mechanisms accompanied by plants against nanoparticle stress by establishing a connection between the expression of genes and cellular metabolism.

The crop was irrigated with disinfected urban wastewater (DUW) obtained from ozone from the Almería Purifying Plant. The average nutrient parameters of DUW were 0.4 mM of nitrate (NO₃⁻), 2.1 mM of ammonium (NH₄⁺), 0.8 mM of potassium (K⁺), and electrical conductivity (EC) 1.6 dS m⁻¹. Three different treatments were established: DUW without additional fertilization (FDUW), DUW with fertilization until the recommended rate was obtained (10.0 mM of N and 3.4 mM of K) (FNK), and DUW with fertilization until 1.5 FNK rate (15.0 mM of N and 5.1 mM of K) (F₁.₅NK) was obtained. The dry-matter production was not conditioned by the fertilizer level. Treatments FNK and F₁.₅NK showed the greatest yield and uptake of N and K independent of the fertilizer level. The most nitrogen (N), calcium (Ca), and magnesium (Mg) were in the leaf, phosphorus (P) was high in fruit, and K was similar in leaf and fruit. With regard to the macronutrient absorption efficiency, the F₁.₅NK treatment showed the least N and K efficiency and the greatest soil salinity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aautumn 3acalcium 3aelectrical conductivity 3afertilizer rates 3agreen beans 3agreenhouses 3airrigated farming 3aleaves 3amagnesium 3anitrates 3anitrogen 3anitrogen-potassium fertilizers 3aozone 3aphosphorus 3apotassium 3asandy loam soils 3asoil salinity 3awastewater 0aDry matter 0afertigation 0amacronutrients uptake 0aNK rates 0asand mulch1 aContreras París, Juana Isabel1 aPlaza, Blanca María1 aLao, M.

Thus, the special placement of radar is utilized to improve cross-range resolution in ISAR image. In this letter, a novel dual-radar fusion method for improving ISAR image cross-range resolution for isolated scattering points on target is proposed. First, the range information of scatters is gathered from radial radar based on multiple signal characterization (MUSIC) algorithm. Then, data interpolation and construction of the modulation function will be completed. Finally, the ISAR image cross-range resolution can be improved by fusing the ISAR image obtained from cross-radar and the modulation function. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated by simulation and experimental results.  aThis work was supported by the Nation Natural Science Foundation of China [61971163].  aPublisher supplied data  a61971163 3aalgorithms 3aimage analysis 3amonitoring 3aremote sensing 3asynthetic aperture radar 3awills1 aChen, Ruida1 aZhang, Yun0 tRemote sensing letters.g2022 Mar. 04, v. 13, no. 3 p.236-246dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12304x2150-70587nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/2150704X.2021.20181433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02565naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245013100175300001800306520111200324536022701436592002801663596001401691650001301705650001701718650001301735650002401748651001301772653002201785653001701807653002101824653003101845653001301876653002101889700002301910700002101933773011801954856008602072852000902158655001202167IND60747235220221119004414.0210816e20210803xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074723522DNAL7 a10.1080/08941920.2021.19213192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTsang, Elizabeth M.12aA Web-Based Approach to Stakeholder Analysis for Identifying and Understanding Broader Constituencies in Wildlife Conservation  ap. 1133-1146.  aShifting social and ecological contexts for conservation in North America have highlighted that wildlife agencies must engage with broad constituencies to achieve their missions. Responding to limitations in practitioner capacity to find, understand, and plan for engagement with a broader array of stakeholders, we developed a web-based method for stakeholder analysis and used it to identify and describe the activities of 214 organizations, including businesses, nongovernmental organizations, and local, state, and federal entities, that promote wildlife viewing in Virginia. We found that the majority of these stakeholders provide social opportunities and informational resources related to wildlife viewing. We also identified geographic and programmatic gaps that informed strategic planning within the state wildlife agency for meaningful engagement with wildlife viewers as a growing constituency. This project demonstrates the ability of web-based stakeholder analysis to generate inclusive and actionable insights about relatively new and unfamiliar stakeholders for natural resource management.  aThis work was supported by the Virginia Tech Department of Fish and Wildlife Conservation under a Departmental Diversity Undergraduate Award and the Virginia Department of Wildlife Resources (DWR) [Grant number EP2610044].  aPublisher supplied data  aEP2610044 3aInternet 3astakeholders 3awildlife 3awildlife management 3aVirginia 0aNatural resources 0aconservation 0acontent analysis 0astakeholder identification 0awebsites 0awildlife viewing1 aBarnes, Jessica C.1 aDayer, Ashley A.0 tSociety & natural resources.g2021 Aug. 3, v. 34, no. 8 p.1133-1146dRoutledgewJournal:jnl45063x1521-07237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08941920.2021.19213193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01952naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245009000167300001800257520095000275592002801225650001301253650001301266650001501279650001701294700001701311700002001328700001901348700001601367700001901383700001801402700002001420773010501440856004801545852000901593655001201602IND50069839520221119155411.0131018e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006983952DNAL7 a10.1007/s11434-013-5831-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Jianguang,10aVariation of dependence of the cusp location at different altitude on the dipole tilt  ap. 3541-3545.  aUsing the Cluster cusp crossings data, dependence of the cusp location at the mid-altitude on the geomagnetic dipole tilt during northward IMF is studied. The results show that the cusp center moves 0.051° Invariant Latitude (ILAT) upon the increase of 1° in the dipole tilt angle at the average altitude of 5.8 RE (Earth radius). According to the present results obtained at the altitude of the Cluster orbit and previous results obtained at other altitudes of other satellite orbits, it is found that the higher the altitude in the cusp region is, the bigger the dependence of cusp location on the dipole tilt angle will be. If the altitude increases by 1 RE in the cusp region, the dependence will increase by 0.012° ILAT upon the increase of 1° in the dipole tilt angle. Some possible physical mechanisms are discussed and it shows that the cusp location will be more sensitive to the solar wind dynamic pressure if the altitude is high.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaltitude 3alatitude 3asatellites 3aspace flight1 aShi, JianKui1 aCheng, ZhengWei1 aZhang, Ziying,1 aWang, Zheng1 aZhang, TieLong1 aLiu, ZhenXing1 aDunlop, Malcolm0 tChinese science bulletin.g2013 Oct., v. 58, no. 28-29 p.3541-3545dSpringer-Verlagx1001-65387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11434-013-5831-1  aDNAL 7aarticle02576naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001900144245007700163300001600240500001900256520117500275592002801450650001201478650001401490650001401504650001601518650001801534650001501552650001501567650000901582650001401591650001901605650001101624650001601635650002101651650001101672650002101683650001701704653002501721653001801746653002401764700002001788700002201808700002401830700002201854773010601876856007901982852000902061655001202070IND60707751420221120132327.0210122e20200813xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070775142DNAL7 a10.1515/biol-2020-00652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSobota, Aldona10aApplication of extrusion-cooking technology in hatchery waste management  ap. 572-579.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe purpose of the present study was to examine the extrusion-cooking process of cereal blends with addition of hatchery waste (HW). The effect of HW addition on the physical properties and chemical composition of the extrudates was examined. The share of the HW in blends with corn meal was variable in the range of 5–30%. The study was conducted using a counter-rotating twin-screw extruder (L:D ratio 12:1, screw speed 75 rpm, die diameters 3 mm × 6 mm, profile of barrel temperature 120/140/180/180/130°C, and material moisture 28%). Increase in the content of the HW from 5 to 30% reduced the expansion ratio, pellet durability index, water absorption index, and water solubility index of the extrudates. The microstructure of the extrudates with HW addition is non-homogeneous; the areas with densely packed and adherent granules, interwoven with fibrous structures, can be observed. Increase in the share of HW leads to a lowering of the levels of crude fiber and total dietary fiber in the extrudates. Moreover, a significant increase in the content of protein, crude fat, and mineral elements such as calcium, sodium, magnesium, and iron was observed.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcium 3acorn meal 3acrude fat 3acrude fiber 3adietary fiber 3adurability 3ahatcheries 3airon 3amagnesium 3amicrostructure 3asodium 3atemperature 3awaste management 3awastes 3awater solubility 3awater uptake 0achemical composition 0aextruded feed 0aphysical properties1 aZarzycki, Piotr1 aWirkijowska, Anna1 aRzedzicki, Zbigniew1 aPawlas, Agnieszka0 tOpen life sciences.g2020 Aug. 13, v. 15, no. 1 p.572-579dDe GruyterwJournal:23145x2391-54127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1515/biol-2020-00653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02916naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006100148245015500209520145700364592002801821650001601849650002201865650001401887650002901901650001101930650001501941650001101956650001501967650002801982650001302010650001902023653002302042653002702065653004102092653001502133653002002148653002702168700005902195700002002254773011602274856008302390852000902473655001202482IND60731531520221120091550.0210904e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073153152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ufug.2021.1270882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJahānī, ʻAlī,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4965-329113aAn application of artificial intelligence techniques in prediction of birds soundscape impact on tourists’ mental restoration in natural urban areas  aThe characteristics of birds' sounds assume a primary role in tourists' mental restoration and stress recovery. The aim of this research is the evaluation of birds' sound composition in mental restoration of urban tourists to develop a decision support system as a practical tool. In this order, the recorded sounds of six birds were composed (57 composed sounds) and the human perception approach was used to assess the impact of sounds on the urban tourist's mental restoration. The MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron), RBFNN (Radial Basis Function Neural Network) and SVM (Support Vector Machine) models were developed for mental restoration prediction in different birds' sound compositions. The results indicated that RBFNN model output (R² training = 0.89, and R² test = 0.85) has the best accuracy compared to the MLP and SVM models in prediction of birds' soundscape score in natural urban areas. According to the sensitivity analysis, the values of White eared Bulbul (Pycononotus leucotis), Great Tit (Parus major), House Sparrow (Passer domesticus), Laughing Dove (Spilopelia senegalensis), White Wagtail (Motacilla alba), and Eurasian Magpie (Pica pica) are prioritized respectively that influence the RBFNN model outputs. In practice, the designed environmental decision support system tool is applied by urban planners, managers, psychoacoustic researchers, and landscape architects to predict the landscape score in different birds' habitats.  aPublisher supplied data 3aParus major 3aPasser domesticus 3aPica pica 3adecision support systems 3ahumans 3alandscapes 3amodels 3aprediction 3asupport vector machines 3atourists 3aurban forestry 0aMental restoration 0aMulti-Layer Perceptron 0aRadial Basis Function Neural Network 0aSoundscape 0aStress recovery 0aSupport Vector Machine1 aKalantary, Saba1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0907-24411 aAlitavoli, Asal0 tUrban forestry & urban greening.g2021 June, v. 61 p.127088-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl893556x1618-86677nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ufug.2021.1270883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03162naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245007800173300001400251500001500265520179900280592002802079650001802107650001202125650001402137650002102151650001402172650001302186650001602199650001602215650001602231650001502247650000902262650001202271650001002283650000902293650001302302650001902315650001402334650001002348651001002358651001102368651001502379653001502394700002302409700001902432773013302451856005102584852000902635655001202644IND50076241520221117204642.0140410e20120101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007624152DNAL7 a10.1080/00103624.2012.6313952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDavenport, Joan R.10aWine Grape Tissue Nutrient Concentrations in the Inland Pacific Northwest  ap. 21-27.  a2019-12-05  aSoil and plant tissue testing is routinely used by growers to assess the status of their crops to determine what, if any, supplemental fertilizers are needed to reach both quality and quantity production goals. In wine grape (Vitis vinifera L.) production, leaf tissue testing is often used as the primary assessment tool for in-season fertilizer adjustment. In this project, we conducted a 3-year survey to evaluate actual leaf nutrient concentrations for comparison with published tissue nutrient guidelines. Leaf petiole and blade samples were collected from six different wine grape cultivars (two white, four red) from eight different sites that geographically encompass Washington's Columbia Valley American Viticultural Area (AVA) (inclusively), the Milton–Freewater area in Oregon, and the Parma area in Idaho. These are all low-rainfall areas (<450 mm/year) in the Pacific Northwest (PNW). Leaf samples (petioles and blades) were collected at bloom and veraison and analyzed for nutrients by a commercial laboratory. Concurrently, replicated nitrogen (N) rate trials were conducted on two Riesling and two Merlot vineyards in the Columbia Valley AVA. The same tissue-sampling technique was employed on grapevines receiving from 0 to 67 kg ha–¹ N for up to 4 consecutive years. Results from the vineyard survey and from the N-rate trials show that many of the nutrient concentrations in the sampled tissues fall outside of the ranges currently considered normal or adequate in published standards. However, grapes from the survey and trial sites were all of sufficiently high quality for production of premium wines. This suggests that currently published standards are not appropriate for use in regulated deficit-irrigated wine grapes in the low rainfall areas of the inland PNW.  aPublisher supplied data 3aplant tissues 3agrowers 3acultivars 3anutrient content 3avineyards 3anitrogen 3aviticulture 3awine grapes 3afertilizers 3aguidelines 3asoil 3asurveys 3awines 3arain 3apetioles 3aVitis vinifera 3anutrients 3acrops 3aIdaho 3aOregon 0aWashington 0aLeaf blade1 aLunden, Jeffrey D.1 aWinkler, Tanya0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g2012 Jan. 1, v. 43, no. 1-2 p.21-27dTaylor & Francis Groupx1532-24167nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00103624.2012.631395  aDNAL 7aarticle03127naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100001900181245006300200300001800263506007600281520167700357592002802034506003702062650002602099650001002125650001402135650001102149650001202160650002702172650005202199650001202251650001802263650002802281650002902309653001902338653000902357653001802366653001902384653002802403653001402431700002002445773009702465856007402562852000902636655001202645IND60117787020221207131644.0141126s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011778702DNAL7 a10.1093/gbe/evt2022doi7 aPMC38799862pmcid7 a243179752pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aŠatović, Eva10aTandem Repeat-Containing MITEs in the Clam Donax trunculus  ap. 2549-2559.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTwo distinct classes of repetitive sequences, interspersed mobile elements and satellite DNAs, shape eukaryotic genomes and drive their evolution. Short arrays of tandem repeats can also be present within nonautonomous miniature inverted repeat transposable elements (MITEs). In the clam Donax trunculus, we characterized a composite, high copy number MITE, named DTC84. It is composed of a central region built of up to five core repeats linked to a microsatellite segment at one array end and flanked by sequences holding short inverted repeats. The modular composition and the conserved putative target site duplication sequence AA at the element termini are equivalent to the composition of several elements found in the cupped oyster Crassostrea virginica and in some insects. A unique feature of D. trunculus element is ordered array of core repeat variants, distinctive by diagnostic changes. Position of variants in the array is fixed, regardless of alterations in the core repeat copy number. Each repeat harbors a palindrome near the junction with the following unit, being a potential hotspot responsible for array length variations. As a consequence, variations in number of tandem repeats and variations in flanking sequences make every sequenced element unique. Core repeats may be thus considered as individual units within the MITE, with flanking sequences representing a “cassette” for internal repeats. Our results demonstrate that onset and spread of tandem repeats can be more intimately linked to processes of transposition than previously thought and suggest that genomes are shaped by interplays within a complex network of repetitive sequences.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCrassostrea virginica 3aclams 3aevolution 3agenome 3ainsects 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aminiature inverted repeat transposable elements 3aoysters 3asatellite DNA 3atandem repeat sequences 3atransposition (genetics) 0amobile element 0aMITE 0asatellite DNA 0atandem repeats 0asequence rearrangements 0aevolution1 aPlohl, Miroslav0 tGenome biology and evolution.g2013, v. 5, no. 12 p.2549-2559dOxford University Press7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/gbe/evt2023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03604naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245014400172300001600316520147000332592002801802650002201830650002201852650001501874650003101889650001001920650001701930650001901947650002201966650001601988650002002004650001402024650001602038650001902054650002502073650001602098650001102114650002402125650000902149650001502158650002902173650001402202650002102216650001202237650001202249650001202261653002602273653002202299653002202321653001302343653002702356653002502383700002102408700001902429700005802448700006002506700001902566700001802585700006102603773017202664856008502836852000902921655001202930IND60561455120221122091702.0180904e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056145512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jbiosc.2017.01.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShimizu, Takenori10aDetection of antibodies against hepatitis B virus surface antigen and hepatitis C virus core antigen in plasma with a waveguide-mode sensor  ap. 760-764.  aIn large-scale disasters, such as huge significant earthquakes, on-site examination for blood typing and infectious disease screening will be very helpful to save lives of victims who need surgical treatment and/or blood transfusion. However, physical damage, such as building collapse, electric power failure and traffic blockage, disrupts the capacity of the medical system. Portable diagnostic devices are useful in such cases of emergency. In this study, we evaluated a waveguide-mode sensor for detection of anti-hepatitis virus antibodies. First, we examined whether we can detect antigen–antibody interaction on a sensor chip immobilized hepatitis B virus surface (HBs) antigen and hepatitis C virus (HCV) core antigen using monoclonal mouse antibodies for HBs antigen and HCV core antigen. We obtained significant changes in the reflectance spectra, which indicate specific antigen–antibody interaction for anti-HBs antibody and anti-HCV antibody. Next, we examined the effect of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody using aminoethyl carbazole as the peroxidase substrate and found that the colorimetric reaction increases detection sensitivity for anti-HBs antibody more than 300 times. Finally, we successfully detected anti-HBs antibody in human blood samples with an enhancing method using a peroxidase reaction. Thus, a portable device utilizing a waveguide-mode sensor may be applied to on-site blood testing in emergency settings.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHepatitis B virus 3aHepatitis C virus 3aantibodies 3aantigen-antibody reactions 3ablood 3ablood groups 3ablood sampling 3ablood transfusion 3acolorimetry 3adetection limit 3adisasters 3aearthquakes 3aelectric power 3ahepatitis C antigens 3ahorseradish 3ahumans 3ainfectious diseases 3amice 3aperoxidase 3areflectance spectroscopy 3ascreening 3asurface antigens 3asurgery 3atraffic 3aviruses 0aWaveguide-mode sensor 0aHepatitis B virus 0aHepatitis C virus 0aAntibody 0aHorseradish peroxidase 0aAminoethyl carbazole1 aTanaka, Torahiko1 aUno, Shigeyuki1 aAshiba, Hiroki1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8764-83571 aFujimaki, Makoto1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4856-422X1 aTanaka, Mutsuo1 aAwazu, Koichi1 aMakishima, Makoto1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4630-905X0 tJournal of bioscience and bioengineering.g2017 June, v. 123, no. 6 p.760-764dElsevier B.V.aThe Society for Biotechnology, JapanwJournal:jnl3929975x1389-17237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiosc.2017.01.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02056naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245012000161300001800281520110800299592002801407650001701435650001101452650001001463650001401473651001001487700001901497700001901516700001701535700001601552773010501568856004801673852000901721655001201730IND50069839820221120231451.0131018e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006983982DNAL7 a10.1007/s11434-013-5862-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChu, Hang12aA new interpretation of the tectonic setting and age of meta-basic volcanics in the Ondor Sum Group, Inner Mongolia  ap. 3580-3587.  aThe Ondor Sum Group in the central Inner Mongolia is mainly composed of meta-basic volcanics intercalated with ferruginous quartzite and quartz schist, and has been interpreted as slices of oceanic crust or an ophiolite suite of the Early Paleozoic or much older ages. This paper presents new LA-ICP-MS zircon U-Pb dating and geochemical data for the meta-basic volcanics. The results show that zircons in the meta-basic volcanics were derived from complicated sources, most of which may be captured by basic magma from the country rocks or other sources. They yield a large age range from the Late Archean to Early Mesozoic with the youngest age group between 246 and 261 Ma, constraining the protolith of the meta-basic volcanics formed in the Late Permian to Early Triassic. The meta-basic volcanics have an affinity to E-MORB in geochemistry, and also a similarity toward OIB, representing a tectonic setting of limited intra-continental ocean basin. This limited basin might have been related to the continuous extension of the area since the Early Permian and finally closed in the Early Mesozoic.  aPublisher supplied data 3ageochemistry 3aquartz 3arocks 3azirconium 3aChina1 aZhang, Jinrui,1 aWei, Chunjing,1 aWang, HuiChu1 aRen, YunWei0 tChinese science bulletin.g2013 Oct., v. 58, no. 28-29 p.3580-3587dSpringer-Verlagx1001-65387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11434-013-5862-7  aDNAL 7aarticle03068naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245014800168300001800316520099600334536053101330592002801861650001201889650002201901650001701923650001601940651001501956651001201971651001101983651001101994653003102005653003402036653002302070653002702093653002202120653002202142700001302164700002202177700002002199700001902219700001802238700002202256700002402278700002402302700002302326773011802349856008602467852000902553655001202562IND60747235620221119004440.0210816e20210803xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074723562DNAL7 a10.1080/08941920.2021.19349302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPowell, Neil10aRethinking Decision Support Under Conditions of Irreducible Uncertainty: Co-Designing a Serious Game to Navigate Baltic Sea Nutrient Enrichment  ap. 1075-1092.  aScience-informed, reductionist policy has systematically failed to address wicked situations. Such situations are highly interconnected and unpredictable. As a consequence, the implementation of so-called desirable interventions can lead to the export of vulnerabilities within and across different societal domains, sectors, intersections and scales. Systemic practice is an emerging field, and highlights the need to enrich scientific inquiry and policy actions through action learning with an “extended peer community'' as a means to navigate wicked situations. In this paper, we report on the potential of game co-design as a systemic practice to improve the situation of Baltic Sea nutrient enrichment. Findings from water catchments in Finland, Sweden and Poland suggest that the co-design of serious games can both enhance the comprehension of wicked situations, and foster self-organized concerted action without imposing a convergence of perspectives amongst diverse stakeholders.  aBONUS RETURN has received funding from BONUS (Art 185), funded jointly by the EU and Formas, a Swedish Research Council for Sustainable Development; Sweden’s Innovation Agency, Vinnova; The Academy of Finland; and the National Centre for Research and Development in Poland.

Analyses have focused on variations in the log abundances of species, with mean logarithmic growth rates when rare, Er, used as metrics for persistence. However, invasion probabilities and the times to extinction are not single‐valued functions of Er and, in some cases, decrease as Er increases. Here, we present a synthesis of stochasticity‐induced stabilization (SIS) phenomena based on the ratio between the expected arithmetic growth μ and its variance g. When the diffusion approximation holds, explicit formulas for invasion probabilities and persistence times are single‐valued, monotonic functions of μ/g. The storage effect in the lottery model, together with other well‐known examples drawn from population genetics, microbiology, and ecology (including discrete and continuous dynamics, with overlapping and non‐overlapping generations), are placed together, reviewed, and explained within this new, transparent theoretical framework. We also clarify the relationships between life‐history strategies and SIS, and study the dynamics of extinction when SIS fails.  aPublisher supplied data  a2669/17cISF‐NRF Singapore joint research program 3aarithmetics 3aecology 3aenvironmental factors 3aextinction 3alife history 3amicrobiology 3amodels 3apopulation genetics 3avariance1 aShnerb, Nadav M.0 tEcology.g2020 Sept., v. 101, no. 9 p.e03098-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl46164x0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecy.30983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03558naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245016000168300001600328520182100344592002802165650001202193650002902205650002402234650001502258650001402273650001502287650003002302650001102332650001302343650001102356650000702367650002502374650001102399650001302410650001402423650001802437650001502455650001602470651001702486653001602503653001902519653001402538653001002552653001402562653001802576700006102594700001702655700002202672773021602694856008502910852000902995655001203004IND60634251420221120154837.0190819e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063425142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecohyd.2019.01.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVezi, Madonna10aResponse of zooplankton communities to altered water quality and seasonal flow changes in selected river dominated estuaries in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa  ap. 393-406.  aGlobally, estuaries are among the most productive ecosystems with many threatened by anthropogenic activities. Zooplankton is a bioindicator of ecosystem integrity. The spatial and temporal composition of zooplankton communities were quantified and compared within and between three estuaries (uMvoti, Thukela and aMatikulu/Nyoni estuaries) with different levels of human pressure in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Additional effects of some physico-chemical variables and seasonal flow patterns to zooplankton community structuring were analyzed. The aMatikulu/Nyoni Estuary was selected as a reference site due to its good ecological state. Sampling dates represented high flow (March and April) and low flow (August and September) from 2014 to 2016. Following aMatikulu/Nyoni, highest abundance was recorded in Thukela and then uMvoti Estuary with copepod Pseudodiaptomus hessei and Acartia natalensis dominating the three estuaries. Highest abundance was recorded during low flow in the uMvoti and Thukela estuaries. Redundancy analysis revealed higher salinity and oxygen as environmental determinants of zooplankton community structure in the aMatikulu/Nyoni while turbidity and pH were the determinants of zooplankton community structures in uMvoti and Thukela estuaries. Elevated concentrations of DIN in the Thukela Estuary during high flow identifies the Thukela River as an important source of nitrogen to this estuary. Our findings suggest that these estuaries be managed to ensure sufficient freshwater supply which controls primary production. Although the three estuaries were from the same biogeographical region with a similar river dominated function, high variability in their zooplankton communities could be explained by differing water quality due to differing human pressure in their catchments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcartia 3aanthropogenic activities 3acommunity structure 3aecosystems 3aestuaries 3afreshwater 3ageographical distribution 3ahumans 3anitrogen 3aoxygen 3apH 3aprimary productivity 3arivers 3asalinity 3aturbidity 3awater quality 3awatersheds 3azooplankton 3aSouth Africa 0aZooplankton 0aHuman pressure 0aEstuaries 0aFlows 0aPollution 0aWater quality1 aDowns, Colleen T.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8334-15101 aWepener, V.,1 aO’Brien, Gordon0 tInternational journal of ecohydrology & hydrobiology.g2019 July, v. 19, no. 3 p.393-406dElsevier B.V.aEuropean Regional Centre for Ecohydrology of the Polish Academy of ScienceswJournal:2195x1642-35937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecohyd.2019.01.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02394naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245013200171300001600303520098500319592002801304650002701332650001201359650001001371650001501381650001301396650001801409650001601427650001801443653002301461653003301484653002201517653002501539653002701564700001701591700002401608700002501632700002201657700001501679773017201694856008501866852000901951655001201960IND60561455420221122091655.0180904e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056145542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jbiosc.2017.01.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMitsukawa, Yuuki10aEnzymatic synthesis of 2′-O-methylribonucleosides with a nucleoside hydrolase family enzyme from Lactobacillus buchneri LBK78  ap. 659-664.  a2′-O-Methylribonucleosides (2′-OMe-NRs) are promising raw materials for the production of nucleic acid drugs. We previously reported that LbNH, a nucleoside hydrolase from Lactobacillus buchneri LBK78 (NITE P-01581), was the first enzyme found to act on 2′-OMe-NRs. In the present study, we determined that LbNH also has the transribosylation activity between 2′-OMe-NRs and nucleobases, in addition to the hydrolyzing activity towards 2′-OMe-NRs. When 2′-O-methyluridine (2′-OMe-UR) and adenine were reacted with LbNH, 2′-O-methyladenosine (2′-OMe-AR) was produced. LbNH preferred purine nucleobases as its acceptor substrates for the transribosylation with 2′-OMe-UR as a donor substrate. Kinetic analysis of LbNH revealed that adenine behaved as a mixed inhibitor of the hydrolysis of 2′-OMe-UR. Under the optimal reaction conditions, the maximum molar yield of enzymatic 2′-OMe-AR produced reached 0.97% towards 2′-OMe-UR, corresponding to 0.16 g/L.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLactobacillus buchneri 3aadenine 3adrugs 3ahydrolysis 3akinetics 3anucleic acids 3anucleosides 3araw materials 0aNucleic acid drugs 0a2′-O-Methylribonucleosides 0aTransribosylation 0aNucleoside hydrolase 0aLactobacillus buchneri1 aHibi, Makoto1 aMatsutani, Narihiro1 aHorinouchi, Nobuyuki1 aTakahashi, Satomi1 aOgawa, Jun0 tJournal of bioscience and bioengineering.g2017 June, v. 123, no. 6 p.659-664dElsevier B.V.aThe Society for Biotechnology, JapanwJournal:jnl3929975x1389-17237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiosc.2017.01.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02850naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245008200168300001600250520122600266592002801492650002601520650000901546650002101555650001201576650002201588650002301610650001501633650001401648650001601662650001701678650001501695650001501710650000701725650001101732650001901743653001901762653001901781653001801800653002601818653001701844653000901861653000901870653000701879653000701886653000801893653000801901653000801909700002301917700005801940700001901998700001602017773013202033856008602165852000902251655001202260IND60629601020221119091307.0190606e20190201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062960102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2018.09.0962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPandey, Arya10aExperimental studies on zeta potential of flocculants for harvesting of algae  ap. 562-569.  aAn experimental study was performed to evaluate the comparative efficiency of bio-flocculant (waste egg shell), laboratory available calcium carbonate (LACC) and alum (Al2 (SO4)3) for harvesting of unicellular microalga, Chlorella pyrenoidosa. The influence of pH on zeta potential (ζ) was also studied to explain the chemistry of flocculation process. The maximum harvesting efficiency (99%) was obtained with alum with deformities in algal cell surfaces. Waste egg-shell material is developed as a low-cost bio-flocculant for harvesting of Chlorella pyrenoidosa using 100 mg egg-shell bio-flocculant/L and 100 mg LACC/L, zeta potential analysis was completed to further understand the chemistry of harvesting efficiency over the different ranges of pH (2.0, 4.0, 6.0, 8.0, and 10.0). The optimized range for harvesting efficiency (HE) of pH is 4.0–8.0 for both flocculants. Maximal harvesting efficiency was achieved at pH 4.0 (99%) and pH 8.0 (95%) with bio-flocculant and LACC respectively. Hence, bio-flocculant based harvesting method is found as the best way to dewatering the algal biomass from aqueous medium with entire and intact algal cell surface with environment friendly and cost-effective approach.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChlorella pyrenoidosa 3aalum 3aaluminum sulfate 3abiomass 3acalcium carbonate 3acost effectiveness 3adewatering 3aegg shell 3aflocculants 3aflocculation 3aharvesting 3amicroalgae 3apH 3awastes 3azeta potential 0aBio-flocculant 0aZeta potential 0aAlgal biomass 0aHarvesting efficiency 0aHealth risks 0aLACC 0aNCIM 0aOD 0aHE 0aSEM 0aEDS 0aAOM1 aPathak, Vinayak V.1 aKothari, Richa1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5415-30591 aBlack, Paul N.1 aTyagi, V.V.0 tJournal of environmental management.g2019 Feb. 01, v. 231 p.562-569dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2018.09.0963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01957naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245011100162300001600273520087800289592002801167596003401195650001601229650001401245650001401259650001501273650001401288650000901302700001201311700001301323700001501336700002001351773014401371856008301515852000901598655001201607IND60767395820221117223952.0220216e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076739582DNAL7 a10.1007/s00128-021-03298-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Ting12aA Hydroponic Study on Effect of Zinc Against Mercury Uptake by Triticale: Kinetic Process and Accumulation  ap. 359-365.  aWe investigated the ability of triticale uptake of Mercury (Hg), clarified whether triticale root uptake of Hg²⁺ via Zinc (Zn²⁺) transports, using hydroponic experiments. At 25℃, when Hg exposure in solution was lower than 20 μM, Hg concentration in the roots can be better described by a hyperbolic function, which shows a saturable characteristic. Under ice-cold (< 2℃) conditions, a nonsaturable (linear) component was found. Low exposure of Zn²⁺ (0–1 μM) inhibited plant Hg uptake when Hg exposure in the solution ranged from 1 to 10 μM, it showed an antagonistic effect of Zn on plant uptake of Hg. When Hg exposure was 20 μM, it revealed a synergistic effect of Zn on plant uptake of Hg, Hg in the root increased at the Zn (1 μM) exposure in the solution. Our results will deepen the understanding of Hg transfer in the soil–plant system.  aPublisher supplied data  a2017YFD0800302cKey Programme 3ahydroponics 3apollution 3asynergism 3atoxicology 3atriticale 3azinc1 aMan, Yi1 aLi, Ping1 aZhang, Hua1 aCheng, Huangxin0 tBulletin of environmental contamination and toxicology.g2022 Feb., v. 108, no. 2 p.359-365dSpringer USwJournal:jnl46145x0007-48617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00128-021-03298-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02915naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245011300170300001600283520124000299592002801539650001301567650001201580650001401592650001501606650001901621650001801640650002101658653001201679653000901691653000701700653000701707653000901714653000801723653000701731653000701738653000701745653000801752653000701760653000801767653000801775653000801783653000701791653000701798653000701805653002001812653001201832653001701844653001201861653002001873653001301893700001701906700001801923700002001941700001801961773021601979856008502195852000902280655001202289IND60634251520221120145844.0190819e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063425152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecohyd.2019.01.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aŠikola, Martin10aFinding water: Reliability of remote-sensing methods in searching for water bodies within diverse landscapes  ap. 383-392.  aSearching for and identification of water bodies (WBs) constitute an integral part of many ecological studies. Because field observations or sophisticated and costly remote sensing techniques (RSTs) cannot always be used, simple methods using freely available data are proposed. The reliability of these techniques in identifying WBs has not yet been experimentally verified, however. This study compares the reliability within various landscape types of five methods/tools in searching for WBs: Google Earth, Landsat 7, Sentinel 2, Open Street Map (OSM), digital water management database (DIBAVOD), and merged layer DOSM (OSM+DIBAVOD). The determined numbers and areas of WBs were compared with values determined by field observation (control). The reliability of all methods improved with increasing WB area. None of the methods was sufficiently accurate to identify WBs smaller than 500m2. Images from the Landsat 7 and Sentinel 2 satellites were demonstrated to be entirely unusable due to low resolution. Within various landscape types, reliability of the methods was comparable. When working with various techniques it is necessary to be aware of the limitations of each. To increase reliability, we recommend combining methods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3aLandsat 3adatabases 3alandscapes 3aremote sensing 3asurface water 3awater management 0aDIBAVOD 0aDOSM 0aER 0aFP 0aGLMM 0aLMM 0aLT 0anA 0anC 0anFP 0anT 0anTP 0aOSM 0apFP 0aRS 0aTP 0aWB 0aAquatic habitat 0aDIBAVOD 0aGoogle Earth 0aLandsat 0aOpen Street Map 0aSentinel1 aChajma, Petr1 aAnděl, Petr,1 aSolský, Milič1 aVojar, Jiří0 tInternational journal of ecohydrology & hydrobiology.g2019 July, v. 19, no. 3 p.383-392dElsevier B.V.aEuropean Regional Centre for Ecohydrology of the Polish Academy of ScienceswJournal:2195x1642-35937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecohyd.2019.01.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02344naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002800148245013600176300001600312520111200328592002801440650001501468650002501483650001201508650001301520650001201533650001401545650002401559650000901583650001401592650001201606650001501618650000901633651001201642700003001654700002601684773014401710856008301854852000901937655001201946IND60767395920221117224034.0220216e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076739592DNAL7 a10.1007/s00128-021-03357-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoruf, Rasheed Olatunji10aMetal Contamination and Health Risks in West African Mud Creeper (Tympanotonos fuscatus var radula) from Abule-Agele Creek, Nigeria  ap. 351-358.  aThis study assessed the seasonal distribution of trace metals in soft tissues of Tympanotonos fuscatus var radula, surrounding water, and sediment of Abule-Agege Creek in Southwest Nigeria. A non-significant variation (p > 0.05) in water physicochemical parameters occurred across wet and dry seasons. Metallic contamination (Copper, zinc, mercury, chromium, lead and cadmium) was found to be higher in T. fuscatus var radula than in water, and the sediment serves as a large depository of these trace metals. In this gastropod, the ability of metal accumulation from water (Bio-water accumulation) was higher than that from sediment (Bio-sediment accumulation). In addition, the linear regression models revealed positive relationship between tissue and sediment concentrations of lead and cadmium for both seasons. The estimated daily intake of investigated metals for both seasons was lower than the oral reference dose, while the target hazard quotient and total hazard index of individual metals were both less than 1, meaning that T. fuscatus var radula from the study region posed no health risk.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGastropoda 3aaverage daily intake 3acadmium 3achromium 3amercury 3apollution 3aregression analysis 3arisk 3asediments 3astreams 3atoxicology 3azinc 3aNigeria1 aDurojaiye, Abiola Fadilat1 aOkunade, Gabriel Femi0 tBulletin of environmental contamination and toxicology.g2022 Feb., v. 108, no. 2 p.351-358dSpringer USwJournal:jnl46145x0007-48617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00128-021-03357-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03218naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006600151245011000217300001800327520177000345592002802115650001302143650001202156650001502168650001502183650001302198650001602211650001002227651001102237653001602248653001902264653001902283653002102302653002302323700002302346700001802369700001902387700002802406700006802434700002102502700002202523773012002545856008602665852000902751655001202760IND60629601120221119091103.0190606e20190201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062960112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2018.09.1002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStereńczak, Krzysztof1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9556-014410aFactors influencing the accuracy of ground-based tree-height measurements for major European tree species  ap. 1284-1292.  aTree height is one of the most important forest characteristics and is one of the crucial measurements taken for either practical or scientific reasons. However, the accuracy of a tree-height measurement may vary in relation to many factors. The work described here thus sought to evaluate the accuracy of ground-based tree-height measurements for major forest-forming tree species of the temperate and boreal zones. The focus was on the importance of factors affecting accuracy of the measurements in question at larger geographical scales. In line with the above research goals, data were gathered from 299 stands throughout Poland and heights of 2388 sample trees of eight species, growing in different stands and site conditions, were measured; heights were then compared with measured lengths of felled trees as a reference. In total, 10 variables to determine factors that may influence ground-based tree-height measurement accuracy were used. We merged them into 4 groups: measurements, topography, stand and biometric-related factors. Results showed that biometric and topographic factors had the greatest relative influence on the accuracy of measurements of tree height. Tree length and species, followed by the slope of the terrain, tree age, and height above sea level were the most important factors found to affect accuracy. In most of the cases studied the terrestrial tree-height measurements were underestimated when set against definitive measurements of length. This was true for all species studied except oak, for which height measurements were typically overestimated. Notwithstanding the broad geographical scope of the work, the particular device used and the team factor were only found to have a marginal influence on measurement accuracy.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiometry 3aforests 3alandscapes 3atopography 3atree age 3atree height 3atrees 3aPoland 0aTree height 0aAbsolute error 0aRelative error 0aEcological study 0aMeasurement device1 aMielcarek, Miłosz1 aWertz, Bogdan1 aBronisz, Karol1 aZajączkowski, Grzegorz1 aJagodziński, Andrzej M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6899-09851 aOchał, Wojciech1 aSkorupski, Maciej0 tJournal of environmental management.g2019 Feb. 01, v. 231 p.1284-1292dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2018.09.1003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03825naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245014900158300001600307520204200323592002802365650002302393650001902416650002002435650002302455650002402478650001002502650001302512650001602525650001302541650000902554650001302563650001602576650002302592650001002615650002102625650002102646650002102667650001902688650001202707650001502719650001402734650001202748650001302760653001502773653002202788653003702810700002102847700001702868700002002885700002102905700002402926700001802950700002402968700001802992773010603010856007403116852000903190655001203199IND60694882320221120133843.0210209e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069488232DNAL7 a10.3382/ps/pez5032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRen, Zhouzheng10aEffects of dietary methionine plus cysteine levels on growth performance and intestinal antibody production in broilers during Eimeria challenge  ap. 374-384.  aResearch has shown that methionine+ cysteine (M+C) requirements may be higher when chickens are infected with Eimeria app. In a 4 × 2 factorial design, broilers (11 to 21 D) were fed one of 4 corn–soybean meal-based diets containing either 0.6, 0.8, 0.9, or 1.0% standardized ileal digestible (SID) M+C; on day 14, broilers from each diet were gavaged with either phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or a commercial coccidiosis vaccine (at 100 × vaccine dose) which provide a mixture of live Eimeria acervulina, Eimeria maxima, and Eimeria tenella oocysts. Growth performance was recorded from day 11 to 21. Plasma and intestinal luminal samples were collected on days 14 and 21. Intestine lesion scores and fecal oocyst counts were conducted on day 21. Regardless of dietary SID M+C levels, compared to PBS gavaged broilers, the Eimeria-challenged broilers had (1) decreased (P < 0.05) body weight gain (BWG), feed intake (FI), and gain-to-feed ratio (G:F); (2) increased (P < 0.05) intestinal lesion scores and fecal oocyst counts; (3) increased (P < 0.05) plasma anti-Eimeria IgG, and intestinal luminal total IgA and anti-Eimeria IgA concentrations; and (4) increased (P < 0.05) levels of duodenum luminal gamma interferon (IFN-γ) and interleukin-10 (IL-10), as well as jejunum and cecum luminal IFN-γ concentrations. Regardless of Eimeria challenge, when compared to 0.6% SID M+C, broilers fed ≥0.8% SID M+C had (1) increased (P < 0.05) BWG, FI, and G:F and (2) increased (P < 0.05) levels of jejunum luminal total IgA. After Eimeria challenge, broilers fed 0.8% SID M+C had increased (P < 0.05) levels of jejunum luminal anti-Eimeria IgA compared to broilers fed diets containing 0.6 and 1.0% SID M+C. Collectively, in 11- to 21-D broilers, the growth suppression caused by Eimeria infection could not be mitigated by further increasing dietary M+C alone ≥0.8%. Further research should investigate interactions between dietary M+C and other nutrients for support of immune function and growth in pathogen-challenged broilers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEimeria acervulina 3aEimeria maxima 3aEimeria tenella 3aantibody formation 3abody weight changes 3acecum 3achickens 3acoccidiosis 3acysteine 3adiet 3aduodenum 3afeed intake 3agrowth performance 3aileum 3aimmunoglobulin A 3aimmunoglobulin G 3ainterferon-gamma 3ainterleukin-10 3ajejunum 3amethionine 3anutrients 3aoocysts 3avaccines 0amethionine 0asulfur amino acid 0abroiler, Eimeria, intestinal IgA1 aBütz, Daniel E.1 aWhelan, Rose1 aNaranjo, Victor1 aArendt, Maria K.1 aRamuta, Mitchell D.1 aYang, Xiaojun1 aCrenshaw, Thomas D.1 aCook, Mark E.0 tPoultry science.g2020 Jan., v. 99, no. 1 p.374-384dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45501x0032-57917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps/pez5033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02381naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245014100161300001800302520112700320592002801447650001401475650001901489650001401508650002501522650001701547650001301564653001901577653001101596653001301607653001801620653001501638653001801653653001301671653001501684653001301699700001701712700001901729773012901748856007301877852000901950655001201959IND60530524920221117225649.0160721e20140505xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053052492DNAL7 a10.1021/sc500112q2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCenci, Steven M.,10aUltrasound-Induced CO2/H2O Emulsions as a Medium for Clean Product Formation and Separation: The Barbier Reaction as a Synthetic Example  ap. 1280-1288.  aSubcritical CO₂/H₂O (30 °C/80 bar) was employed as a renewable solvent mixture in a 1 dm³ ultrasound reactor. As a representative synthetic transformation, the metal-mediated Barbier allylation was used to demonstrate the facility of formation and separation of the homoallylic alcohol product. The chemoselectivity over the competing aldehyde reduction could be improved by deploying the biocompatible nonionic surfactant Tween 80, a saturated salt aqueous phase, or by carrying out the reaction at 60 °C/120 bar. All of these modifications led to an apparent rate increase in the desired allylation. A range of substituted benzaldehydes afforded the corresponding homoallylic alcohols in moderate to high yields. The presence of water constituted a necessary condition for efficient product formation, while CO₂ provided an appropriate phase for clean product separation by exploiting a favorable homoallylic alcohol enrichment. In this way, 0.025 mol of homoallylic alcohol product could be isolated from the CO₂ phase in 1 h, avoiding further extraction stages that would typically require organic solvents.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaldehydes 3acarbon dioxide 3aemulsions 3anonionic surfactants 3apolysorbates 3asolvents 0aCarbon dioxide 0aMixing 0aEmulsion 0aMass transfer 0aAllylation 0aAqueous media 0aBiphasic 0aSonication 0aKinetics1 aCox, Liam R.1 aLeeke, Gary A.0 tACS sustainable chemistry .g2014 May 05, v. 2, no. 5 p.1280-1288dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/sc500112q3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03568naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005300151245012200204520223800326592002802564650002602592650002402618650002902642650002502671650001602696650002202712650002102734650001502755650001602770650001702786650001502803653001502818653001702833653002802850653002302878653002302901700002102924773011802945856008603063852000903149655001203158IND60758397420221123030943.0220124e20220215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075839742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.1141542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeim, Amy1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0073-185310aChanges in plant community composition and functional plant traits over a four-year period on an extensive green roof  aConstructed ecosystems like green roofs are increasingly deployed in cities to mitigate issues associated with urbanization. To minimize the cost of green roof infrastructure, shallow growing media (substrate) for plants is often employed. Spatial heterogeneity in substrate depth has also been hypothesized to allow greater plant species diversity without adding to the weight. Stress and competition can change green roof plant communities after initial planting, but little is known about the long-term effects of spatial heterogeneity on vegetation composition and functional characteristics. Our goal was to determine how green roof plant communities and, in turn, functional plant traits, change over time in response to environmental stress and substrate heterogeneity. This four-year experiment used four substrate depth treatments: three with homogenous substrate depths of 5 cm, 10 cm, and 15 cm, and one treatment with a heterogenous substrate depth that varied between 5 cm and 15 cm (5/15 cm). The volume of the substrate in the 10 cm treatment and 5/15 cm treatment was equal. By the end of this four-year experiment, variation occurred between treatments for community composition and functional diversity, with the greatest species richness observed in the least stressful treatment (15 cm) and the greatest functional diversity and evenness observed in the most stressful treatment (5 cm). Additionally, each treatment had lower functional diversity after four years compared to the initially planted community. When the heterogenous 5/15 cm treatment was compared to the homogenous 10 cm treatment, there were no differences in the number of plant species, but the treatments contained two distinct plant communities. Furthermore, the 5/15 cm treatment supported taller species, a trait value associated with reduced stormwater runoff and substrate temperature. This finding indicates that creating green roofs with a heterogenous substrate depth could improve overall green roof function without increasing roof weight. Substrate depth can be manipulated by green roof designers to alter vegetation characteristics, but species and functional diversity showed opposite trends along the depth gradient.  aPublisher supplied data 3abotanical composition 3acommunity structure 3aenvironmental management 3afunctional diversity 3agreen roofs 3aspatial variation 3aspecies richness 3astormwater 3atemperature 3aurbanization 3avegetation 0aGreen roof 0aPlant traits 0aSubstrate heterogeneity 0aCommunity assembly 0aColonizing species1 aLundholm, Jeremy0 tJournal of environmental management.g2022 Feb. 15, v. 304 p.114154-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.1141543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03474naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005600139245012700195300001600322520207900338592002802417650001402445650001002459650000902469650001102478650001402489650002102503650001002524650001302534650001602547650002502563650002102588650001802609650001202627650001502639650002402654653001202678653002502690653002102715653001302736653002002749700001802769700001602787773010602803856007402909852000902983655001202992IND60694882420221120133913.0210209e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069488242DNAL7 a10.3382/ps/pez5112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Shu-Biao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1790-601510aHistorical flaws in bioassays used to generate metabolizable energy values for poultry feed formulation: a critical review  ap. 385-406.  aDietary energy available to animals is key for formulating feed as it is required for all aspects of the animal's life. In poultry, apparent (AME) and true (TME) metabolizable energy (ME) values have been used for feed formulation with (AMEₙ or TMEₙ) or without correction for nitrogen balance. For the past 50 yr, the accuracy of ME has been an ongoing debate, and the comparability of data produced using different bioassay systems is often questionable. Overall, the ingredient matric ME values used in feed formulation are not consistent, and to some extent, confusing. This review was to examine ME data published in the past century to elucidate the accuracy of different bioassay systems and examine the values for accuracy and useability. A variety of flaws are identified in the literature, suggesting a thorough re-thinking of feedstuff ME values currently used in feed formulation and in developing prediction equations. Two protocols, namely multiple linear regression and basal diet substitution methods, are proposed as more accurate bioassays for feedstuff ME values. AME aligns more closely with the actual energy levels of feed ingredients likely available to growing birds, which should be used for poultry feed formulations instead of AMEₙ. It is suggested that nutritionists need to carefully apply any reported AME values and only use those in formulation practice after careful scrutinizing. Any in vitro, NIR or table values must be calibrated or computed based on the values produced from flawless bioassays so as to apply the derived values accurately. Flaws identified in this literature review can be avoided with care to achieve more accurate AME. However, the assumption that the energy of individual ingredients is additive in a complete diet is still untrue at least under some circumstances. This may require efforts from industry and researchers to investigate relations among the main ingredients in a complete diet so that more accurate formulation can be performed based on the outcomes that may fine-tune the additivity assumption.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioassays 3abirds 3adiet 3aenergy 3aequations 3afeed formulation 3afeeds 3aindustry 3aingredients 3ametabolizable energy 3anitrogen balance 3anutritionists 3apoultry 3aprediction 3aregression analysis 0apoultry 0ametabolizable energy 0afeed formulation 0abioassay 0afeed ingredient1 aChoct, Mingan1 aPesti, Gene0 tPoultry science.g2020 Jan., v. 99, no. 1 p.385-406dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45501x0032-57917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps/pez5113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02527naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006600151245014800217300001800365520102800383592002801411650001001439650001801449650001201467650002401479650003201503650001601535650001901551650002601570650000901596650001201605653003601617653003301653653002601686653001801712653002301730700002101753700001701774700001901791700002101810700002301831773012001854856008601974852000902060655001202069IND60629601320221119091439.0190606e20190201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062960132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2018.10.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPastor-Poquet, Vicente1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4897-655810aSemi-continuous mono-digestion of OFMSW and Co-digestion of OFMSW with beech sawdust: Assessment of the maximum operational total solid content  ap. 1293-1302.  aIn this study, mono-digestion of the organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW) and co-digestion of OFMSW with beech sawdust, simulating green waste, were used to investigate the maximum operational total solid (TS) content in semi-continuous high-solids anaerobic digestion (HS-AD). To alleviate substrate overloading in HS-AD, the effluent mass was relatively reduced compared to the influent mass, extending the mass retention time. To this aim, the reactor mass was daily evaluated, permitting to assess the reactor content removal by biogas production. During mono-digestion of OFMSW, the NH3 inhibition and the rapid TS removal prevented to maintain HS-AD conditions (i.e. TS ≥ 10%), without exacerbating the risk of reactor acidification. In contrast, the inclusion of sawdust in OFMSW permitted to operate HS-AD up to 30% TS, before acidification occurred. Therefore, including a lignocellulosic substrate in OFMSW can prevent acidification and stabilize HS-AD at very high TS contents (i.e. 20–30%).  aPublisher supplied data 3aFagus 3aacidification 3aammonia 3aanaerobic digestion 3agas production (biological) 3agreen waste 3alignocellulose 3amunicipal solid waste 3arisk 3asawdust 0aHigh-solids anaerobic digestion 0aInfluent/effluent uncoupling 0aSubstrate overloading 0aAcidification 0aAmmonia inhibition1 aPapirio, Stefano1 aTrably, Eric1 aRintala, Jukka1 aEscudié, Renaud1 aEsposito, Giovanni0 tJournal of environmental management.g2019 Feb. 01, v. 231 p.1293-1302dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2018.10.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03358naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100001900169245009900188300001800287520113800305592002801443650004401471650001101515650001701526650001201543650001101555650001301566650002101579650004401600650001401644650003001658650001201688650005401700650004301754650002201797650002901819650006201848650003901910650003401949650003701983650003602020650002202056650000902078650003502087650002102122650002502143650003902168650004602207650001302253650003302266650004502299650002102344650002202365700001402387700001402401700001802415700001602433700001502449773009202464856008402556990002302640852000902663655001202672IND60087502920221121234738.0141102e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008750292DNAL7 a238166522pmid7 a10.1016/j.actbio.2013.06.0362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarros, A.A.A.10aCarboxymethylation of ulvan and chitosan and their use as polymeric components of bone cements  ap. 9086-9097.  aUlvan, extracted from the green algae Ulva lactuca, and chitosan, extracted from Loligo forbesis squid-pen, were carboxymethylated, yielding polysaccharides with an average degree of substitution of ∼98% (carboxymethyl ulvan, CMU) and ∼87% (carboxymethyl chitosan, N,O-CMC).

Mechanical and in vitro bioactivity tests indicate that the inclusion of CMU in the cement formulation, i.e. 0.50:0.50N,O-CMC:CMU, enhances its mechanical performance (compressive strength 52.4±8.0MPa and modulus 2.3±0.3GPa), generates non-cytotoxic cements and induces the diffusion of Ca and/or P-based moieties from the surface to the bulk of the cements.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aLoligo 3aUlva lactuca 3acalcium 3acement 3achitosan 3amolecular weight 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3atitration 2aAcetylationxdrug effects 2aAnimals 2aBiocompatible Materialsxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aBone Cementsxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aCalciumxanalysis 2aCell Deathxdrug effects 2aChitosanxanalogs & derivativesxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aCompressive Strengthxdrug effects 2aElastic Modulusxdrug effects 2aGlass Ionomer Cementsxchemistry 2aMagnetic Resonance Spectroscopy 2aMaterials Testing 2aMice 2aMicroscopy, Electron, Scanning 2aMolecular Weight 2aPhosphorusxanalysis 2aPolymersxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aPolysaccharidesxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aPorosity 2aSpectrometry, X-Ray Emission 2aSpectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared 2aWaterxchemistry 2aX-Ray Diffraction1 aAlves, A.1 aNunes, C.1 aCoimbra, M.A.1 aPires, R.A.1 aReis, R.L.0 tActa biomaterialia.g2013 Nov., v. 9, no. 11 p.9086-9097dElsevier Ltdx1742-70617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actbio.2013.06.0363Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02603naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001300152245011200165300001600277520164900293592002801942650000801970650001301978650000901991650001302000650001102013650001602024700001602040700001402056773008902070856008602159990002302245852000902268655001202277IND60092005820221118034002.0141103e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009200582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.buildenv.2011.10.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yang10aNumerical investigation of the influence of room factors on HAM transport in a full-scale experimental room  ap. 114-124.  aTo model the indoor environment influenced by room factors including moisture loads and ventilation conditions, the governing equations of heat, air and moisture (HAM) transport inside the room and through the envelope, including the coupling process of the interaction of heat and moisture between indoor air and envelope, need to be solved. This paper presents a CFD model of the indoor environment that takes into account the heat and moisture transfer through the envelope in a single simulation environment. The comparisons between experimental data and simulation results show close agreement. This model is then implemented in 12 cases to study the influence of moisture loads, ventilation rates, and positions of the air inlet and outlet on the indoor environment and on the heat and moisture transport through the envelope. Simulation results show that the humidity responses of the test room vary significantly for different moisture loads from 42g/h to 91g/h and for different ventilation rates from 0.5 air change per hour (ach) to 1ach. Changing the positions of the ventilation vents alters the air flow pattern significantly, thus affecting the ventilation efficiency. With a heat and moisture source inside the test room, the changed ventilation efficiency influences the indoor environment significantly, especially under low ventilation rates. The increased ventilation rate carries away more heat and moisture, which reduces both temperature and moisture levels inside the room. Under the mixed convection condition, the indoor temperature and moisture levels dominate the heat and moisture transport through the wall system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aair flow 3aheat 3ahumidity 3amodels 3atemperature1 aFazio, Paul1 aRao, Jiwu0 tBuilding and environment.g2012 Apr., v. 50 p.114-124dElsevier Ltdx0360-13237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2011.10.0213Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03637naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245013000169300001600299520228500315592002802600650002002628650001902648650002302667650001602690650001702706650001202723650001102735650002102746650001402767650001902781650000702800650001502807650001402822650000902836653002102845653003802866653001802904700002102922700002002943700002102963773013502984856005103119852000903170655001203179IND50076242420221117204622.0140410e20120101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007624242DNAL7 a10.1080/00103624.2012.6346952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSosa, Anacleto10aBiomass Accumulation and its Relationship with the Demand and Concentration of Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium in Lettuce  ap. 121-133.  aLettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) has a short cultivation cycle and a rare growth pattern. The nutritional management program of this species must be designed before its establishment in field or greenhouse. There are two scientifically based methods to design its fertilization management: the simplified rational model and the dynamics of nutritional accumulation. There is not much information to input into these methods. The present study reports about the biomass accumulation pattern of lettuce, cv. Coolward, and its relationship with the demand and concentration of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K). The study was conducted in a greenhouse with a slightly acidic sandy-loam substrate (pH 6.5) and a medium/high content of organic matter and nutrients. Twenty-one replicates were set in pots with increasing amounts of soil, depending on the time of harvest. Nine samplings were conducted from emergence up to commercial maturity (MC) (0–65 days after emergence, DDE). The plants collected were divided into two parts, aboveground (PA) and root (PR), and their dry weights and concentrations of N, P, and K were measured. With these data, biomass relative accumulation and nutrients were calculated. Total biomass association (BT) with the demand and concentrations of N, P, and K was estimated. The growth of lettuce during the first 35 DDE was slow and only represented 10% of the total accumulation of biomass, N, P, and K, mainly in PA. From the beginning of the rosette formation (IFRO) up to MC, the linear accumulation stage of MS, N, P, and K emerged. Over the last 22 days of its cycle, the crop acquired more than 60% of MS and nutrients measured at harvest. The PA accumulated nearly 90% of MS, N, P, and K, and the remaining 10% was found in PR. A close linear association was established between BT and the demand of N, P, and K in lettuce (R² = 0.99), which leads us to assume that the simplified rational model might be employed to estimate the dose of fertilization in this crop. The concentrations of N, P, and K in BT at MC were 4.0, 0.46, and 4.3%, respectively. These values are similar to those reported as internal requirements for this crop in other countries; on this account, they could be used tentatively to feed the models proposed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDDE (pesticide) 3aLactuca sativa 3abiomass production 3agreenhouses 3aharvest date 3alettuce 3amodels 3anitrogen content 3anutrients 3aorganic matter 3apH 3aphosphorus 3apotassium 3asoil 0aConceptual model 0adynamics of nutrient accumulation 0afertilization1 aPadilla, Juliana1 aOrtiz, Joaquín1 aEtchevers, J.

The conceptually new method for the fabrication of non-agglomerated PPy-MWCNT with good coating uniformity allowed the fabrication of uniform and well-dispersed N-AC-MWCNT with high surface area. The use of N-AC-MWCNT allowed the fabrication of supercapacitor electrodes with high mass loading in the range of 15–35 mg cm–² and with a high active material to current collector mass ratio of 0.21–0.50. The N-AC-MWCNT electrodes showed excellent electrochemical performance in aqueous 0.5 M Na₂SO₄ electrolyte. The maximum specific capacitance of 3.6 F cm–² (103.1 F g–¹) was achieved for mass loading of 35 mg cm–² at a scan rate of 2 mV s–¹. The aqueous supercapacitor cells, based on N-AC-MWCNT electrodes, exhibited excellent performance with energy density of 16.1 mWh g–¹, power density of 14.4 W g–¹, and enlarged voltage window of 1.8 V. The individual electrodes and cells showed good capacitance retention at high charge–discharge rates and good cycling stability. Moreover, the N-AC-MWCNT electrodes showed promising performance for capacitive deionization of water. The feasibility of capacitive removal of organic dyes from aqueous solutions has been demonstrated. A quartz crystal microbalance method was used as a tool for the analysis of electrosorption and electrodesorption of ions and charged dyes during charge and discharge.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaqueous solutions 3aenergy 3aions 3anitrogen 3asodium sulfate 3aenergy density 3asurface area 3acarbon nanotubes 3aelectrodes 3aquartz 3acapacitance 3aelectrochemistry 3awater purification 3adyes 0aelectrolytes 0aActivated carbon 0aCarbon nanotube 0aPolypyrrole 0aDye 0aSupercapacitor 0aCapacitive deionization1 aRen, Meng1 aZhitomirsky, Igor0 tACS sustainable chemistry .g2014 May 05, v. 2, no. 5 p.1289-1298dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/sc500118r3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03310naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006700151245009000218300001600308520174300324592002802067650002602095650002202121650001902143650002102162650002002183650001802203650001102221650002202232650000902254650001702263650002502280650002202305650002502327650001602352650002302368651001702391651001202408653001902420653002802439653002402467653003002491653001202521653001202533700001602545700001802561773011802579856008602697852000902783655001202792IND60629601420221119091425.0190606e20190201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062960142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2018.10.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNguyễn, Đức Kiên,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7757-622510aEvidence of climatic change in Vietnam: Some implications for agricultural production  ap. 524-545.  aSystemic changes in environmental conditions, such as climate, can have a significant impact on both natural and human systems. This paper provides an improved understanding of the spatio-temporal variations in underlying climate processes, and the potential effects climate change may have on Vietnam's agricultural sector. Statistical methods were combined with geostatistical techniques to test the statistical significance of long-term trends in the climatic variables, graphically representing the distribution of climate patterns, identifying variations and trends of changes over time and their likely effects on agricultural production. By using records of monthly precipitation and temperature for a relatively long-term period (1975–2014) over a high density of 112 meteorological stations across the country, robust statistical and visual evidence of climatic change throughout Vietnam are provided. The Mann-Kendall trend test confirms the statistically significant long-term trends of rainfall and temperature in many regions across the country. The visual analysis shows remarkable changes in the spatio-temporal distribution patterns of those variables and most of the ‘hotspot’ areas identified by geostatistical mapping are in areas with confirmed long-term trends. The long-term significant trends are also concentrated in areas with very high proportion of agricultural land, particularly land used for rice production in the Red River and Mekong River deltas. The findings deliver a better understanding of underlying climate processes and impacts across regions of Vietnam and provide a basis to develop effective climate-related policies for agricultural production in response to changing climatic conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural industry 3aagricultural land 3aclimate change 3aclimatic factors 3acrop production 3ageostatistics 3ahumans 3aissues and policy 3arain 3ariver deltas 3aspatial distribution 3aspatial variation 3astatistical analysis 3atemperature 3atemporal variation 3aMekong River 3aVietnam 0aClimate change 0aSpatio-temporal pattern 0aStatistical methods 0aGeostatistical techniques 0aFarming 0aVietnam1 aAncev, Tiho1 aRandall, Alan0 tJournal of environmental management.g2019 Feb. 01, v. 231 p.524-545dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2018.10.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03178naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245010200164520166300266592002801929650001701957650002501974650002101999650001502020650002102035650001902056651001002075653002102085653002302106653001702129653001902146700001402165700005502179700001902234700005602253700001202309700001602321700001602337700001602353700001802369700001702387700002602404700005802430773011602488856008302604852000902687655001202696IND60731532320221120111639.0210904e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073153232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ufug.2021.1270982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Zhiwen10aDrivers of spontaneous plant richness patterns in urban green space within a biodiversity hotspot  aUrban green space provides refuges for species that are unintentionally introduced by humans and which do not belong to the remnants of natural habitats in urban areas. However, the quantitative relationships between urban green space properties and these spontaneous species are unclear. To address this, we surveyed plant species occurring in urban green patches in Kunming city, which is located in a biodiversity hotspot in southwest China. We classified spontaneous plants into native, non-native and invasive plant species. A total of 386 spontaneous species belonging to 278 genera and 92 families were recorded in 190 patches. Most of the recorded species were herbaceous plants (76.2 %). While invasive species constituted a relatively small proportion of the total species pool (17.9 %), six out of ten of the most frequently occurring species were invasive. Regression models inspired by the theory of Island Biogeography show that total, native, non-native and invasive spontaneous species richness in urban green patches were best explained by the size of the ‘island’ (patch area), dispersal limitations (as expressed by ‘distance to city boundary’) and edge effects (as shown by the landscape shape index). While the set of drivers of spontaneous plants is similar for the different groups of species, the relative importance of each driver varies among them. Our study provides quantification of drivers of biodiversity patterns in urban green space. Based on this understanding, planning and management of urban green space can be adapted to maximize spontaneous plant conservation in rapidly urbanizing biodiversity hotspot regions.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiogeography 3agreen infrastructure 3ainvasive species 3alandscapes 3aspecies richness 3aurban forestry 3aChina 0aSpecies richness 0aSpontaneous plants 0aUrbanization 0aUrban greening1 aSong, Kun1 aPan, Yingji1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8203-39431 aMalkinson, Dan1 aZhang, Xijin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0399-78571 aJia, Bo1 aXia, Tiyuan1 aGuo, Xueyan1 aLiang, Hong1 aHuang, Shasha1 aDa, Liangjun1 aVan Bodegom, Peter M.1 aCieraad, Ellen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9813-95900 tUrban forestry & urban greening.g2021 June, v. 61 p.127098-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl893556x1618-86677nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ufug.2021.1270983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03523naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002300164245014700187300001600334500001500350520138800365592002801753650002201781650002201803650001801825650001401843650002401857650002201881650005201903650001401955650003401969650001202003650001002015650002402025650002902049650001402078650001202092650002102104650001002125650006702135650001802202650003302220650002702253650002202280650002702302650002802329650001302357650003302370650002302403650003302426650002902459650002702488653001502515653001002530700001902540700001902559700002302578700002502601700002102626773010002647856008102747852000902828655001202837IND4482532120221119173759.0141111e201108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448253212DNAL7 a216016432pmid7 a10.1016/j.fgb.2011.05.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaidyaroy, Dipnath12aA 971-bp insertion in the rns gene is associated with mitochondrial hypovirulence in a strain of Cryphonectria parasitica isolated from nature  ap. 775-783.  a2019-12-06  aIn the chestnut-blight fungus Cryphonectria parasitica, cytoplasmically transmissible hypovirulence phenotypes frequently are elicited by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) virus infections.

In this study, we describe an altered form of mtDNA that is associated with hypovirulence and senescence in a virus-free strain of C. parasitica, KFC9, which was obtained from nature and has an elevated level of cyanide-resistant respiration. In this strain, a 971-bp DNA element, named InC9, has been inserted into the first exon of the mitochondrial small-subunit ribosomal RNA (rns) gene. Sequence analysis indicates that InC9 is a type A1 group II intron that lacks a maturase-encoding ORF. RT-PCR analyses showed that the InC9 sequence is spliced inefficiently from the rRNA precursor. The KFC9 strain had very low amounts of mitochondrial ribosomes relative to virulent strains, thus most likely is deficient in mitochondrial protein synthesis and lacks at least some of the components of the cyanide-sensitive, cytochrome-mediated respiratory pathway. The attenuated-virulence trait and the splicing-defective intron are transferred asexually and concordantly by hyphal contact from hypovirulent donor strains to virulent recipients, confirming that InC9 causes hypovirulence.  aPublisher supplied data 3asequence analysis 3aprotein synthesis 3aribosomal RNA 3aphenotype 3aopen reading frames 3amitochondrial DNA 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3aribosomes 3acyanide-resistant respiration 3aviruses 3aexons 3adouble-stranded RNA 3aCryphonectria parasitica 3avirulence 3aintrons 3avirulent strains 3afungi 2aAscomycotaxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxpathogenicity. 2aBase Sequence 2aDNA, Mitochondrialxgenetics 2aFagaceaexmicrobiology 2aIntronsxgenetics 2aMitochondriaxgenetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutation 2aPlant Diseasesxmicrobiology 2aPlasmidsxgenetics 2aProtein Structure, Secondary 2aRNA, Ribosomalxgenetics 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 0asenescence 0agenes1 aHausner, Georg1 aHafez, Mohamed1 aMichel, François,1 aFulbright, Dennis W.1 aBertrand, Helmut0 tFungal genetics and biology.g2011 Aug., v. 48, no. 8 p.775-783dElsevier Inc.x1087-18457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fgb.2011.05.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03234naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245010500161300001600266520144900282592002801731650002501759650002301784650001201807650001101819650001701830650002101847650001201868650001301880650003101893650002401924650001301948650001101961650001201972650002201984650001802006653003002024653001002054653001602064653002502080653002202105653001002127700001402137700001902151700001202170700001502182700001402197700001402211700001702225700001202242700001802254700005102272773023002323856008202553852000902635655001202644IND60634252220221120154659.0190425e20190320xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063425222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jgg.2019.03.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPan, Jing10aControl of de novo root regeneration efficiency by developmental status of Arabidopsis leaf explants  ap. 133-140.  aDe novo root regeneration (DNRR) has wide applications in agriculture such as those related to cutting technology. Detached Arabidopsis thaliana leaf explants can regenerate adventitious roots without added hormones. The regenerative ability is highly dependent on the developmental status of the leaf. An immature leaf has a higher regenerative ability, while a mature leaf is difficult to regenerate. Using RNA-Seq analysis, we showed that the expression levels of many genes, including those in the auxin network, changed during leaf maturation. Particularly, the expression levels of many YUCCA (YUC) genes in the auxin biosynthesis pathway are responsive to leaf maturation. Overexpression of YUC1 in the yuc-1D dominant mutant rescued the rooting defects caused by leaf maturation. In addition, YUC4 expression levels were also affected by circadian rhythms. The regenerative ability was reduced in both immature and mature mutant leaf explants from the new wuschel-related homeobox 11-3 (wox11-3) and wox12-3 mutant alleles created by the CRISPR/Cas9 method. Overall, the transcriptome and genetic data, together with the auxin concentration analysis, indicate that the ability to upregulate auxin levels upon detachment may be reduced during leaf maturation. Thus, multiple developmental and environmental signals may converge to control auxin accumulation, which affects the efficiency of the WOX11/12-mediated DNRR from leaf explants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aadventitious roots 3aalleles 3aauxins 3abiosynthesis 3acircadian rhythm 3acutting 3aexplants 3agene expression regulation 3agene overexpression 3ahormones 3aleaves 3amutants 3asequence analysis 3atranscriptome 0aDe novo root regeneration 0aWOX11 0aArabidopsis 0aDevelopmental status 0aCircadian rhythms 0aYUCCA1 aZhao, Fei1 aZhang, Guifang1 aPan, Yu1 aSun, Lijun1 aBao, Ning1 aQin, Peng1 aChen, Lyuqin1 aYu, Jie1 aZhang, Yijing1 aXu, Lin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4718-12860 tJournal of genetics and genomics.g2019 Mar. 20, v. 46, no. 3 p.133-140dElsevier LtdaInstitute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Genetics Society of ChinawJournal:2201x1673-85277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jgg.2019.03.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02553naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245012000168500001400288520137800302592002801680650001601708650001801724650001701742650001401759650001001773650001001783650001001793650001101803650002001814650002501834650002301859700001901882700001901901700002201920773013301942856008302075852000902158655001202167IND60707752620221120122019.0200821e20200801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070775262DNAL7 a10.3390/agriculture100803192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHorst, Ariane 10aPig Organ Lesions Recorded in Different Abattoirs: A Statistical Approach to Assess the Comparability of Prevalence  aNAL-light  aDocumented lesions of slaughtered pigs provide a high-density data-pool that could be valuable for the purpose of animal health monitoring and breeding. However, data quality and structure hamper the application of statistical methods. The present study provides an approach that enables statistical analysis and evaluates the comparability of lesion prevalence among abattoirs. The German Quality and Safety database provided data of recorded lung, pleura, liver, and heart lesions. Filter criteria were used to improve the data structure. Data of n = 8,004,769 animals, recorded in nine abattoirs over a period of 18 months, were analyzed. Lesion prevalences were successfully modeled by applying a generalized linear mixed model. To examine prevalence differences, the coefficient of variation (CV) on a six-monthly basis was calculated, and a grand mean test (GMT) of significance was applied. High variations in estimated prevalence occurred on abattoir, six-monthly and organ basis. The highest variation occurred in the lung (CV = 64.7%), whereas liver lesions showed the lowest variation (CV = 21.8%). The GMT enabled the visualization of these variations between abattoirs, organs and over time. Concerning the assessment of the comparability of prevalences, it provides a promising tool to monitor changes in lesion examination and to address divergent abattoirs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagriculture 3aanimal health 3adata quality 3adatabases 3aheart 3aliver 3alungs 3apleura 3aslaughterhouses 3astatistical analysis 3astatistical models1 aGertz, Marvin 1 aHasler, Mario 1 aKrieter, Joachim 0 tAgriculture (Basel).g2020 Aug. 01, v. 10, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12387x2077-04727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agriculture100803193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02439naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245015000156300001800306520100100324592002801325650001301353650001101366650001701377650001101394650001901405650001801424650002301442650002301465650001601488650001701504650001501521653002001536653002901556653002401585653002501609700001801634700001501652700001201667700001601679700001801695700001501713700001801728773012901746856007301875852000901948655001201957IND60530525320221117225722.0160721e20140505xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053052532DNAL7 a10.1021/sc50014472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Guojie10aInterface Modification of ZnO-Based Inverted PTB7:PC71BM Organic Solar Cells by Cesium Stearate and Simultaneous Enhancement of Device Parameters  ap. 1331-1337.  aWe used cesium stearate (CsSt) to modify the interface of the electron-extracting contact in inverted organic solar cells. Surface microstructure, optical properties, and electrical characterization as well as exciton generation rate and dissociation probability were investigated to understand the impact of CsSt on the interface contact. The results indicated that by incorporation of CsSt, the surface morphology and energy level as well as conductivity of a zinc oxide (ZnO) film were improved. On the basis of the above properties, highly efficient inverted organic solar cells have been demonstrated by using a ZnO nanoparticle film and CsSt stacked bilayer structure as the cathode interfacial layer. The insertion of a CsSt layer between the ZnO film and active layer improved the electron extraction efficiency, and a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.69% was achieved. The PCE was improved by 20% as compared to the reference device using a ZnO-only electron extraction layer.  aPublisher supplied data 3acathodes 3acesium 3adissociation 3aenergy 3amicrostructure 3ananoparticles 3aoptical properties 3aphotovoltaic cells 3aprobability 3astearic acid 3azinc oxide 0aCesium stearate 0aInterfacial modification 0aOrganic solar cells 0aExciton dissociation1 aJiu, Tonggang1 aTang, Gang1 aLi, Jun1 aLi, Pandeng1 aSong, Xiaojin1 aLu, Fushen1 aFang, Junfeng0 tACS sustainable chemistry .g2014 May 05, v. 2, no. 5 p.1331-1337dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/sc50014473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03428naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100006200138245009500200500001900295500002000314520208400334592002802418596007002446650001802516650001902534650001402553650001202567650001002579650001502589650000902604650001402613650001302627650001502640650001102655650001102666650001602677700006202693700006102755773010902816856007202925852000902997655001203006IND60708976220221122125701.0200902e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070897622DNAL7 a10.1002/ecy.31082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJabis, Meredith D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2479-579510aWarming acts through earlier snowmelt to advance but not extend alpine community flowering  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aLarge‐scale warming will alter multiple local climate factors in alpine tundra, yet very few experimental studies examine the combined yet distinct influences of earlier snowmelt, higher temperatures and altered soil moisture on alpine ecosystems. This limits our ability to predict responses to climate change by plant species and communities. To address this gap, we used infrared heaters and manual watering in a fully factorial experiment to determine the relative importance of these climate factors on plant flowering phenology, and response differences among plant functional groups. Heating advanced snowmelt and flower initiation, but exposed plants to colder early‐spring conditions in the period prior to first flower, indicating that snowmelt timing, not temperature, advances flowering initiation in the alpine community. Flowering duration was largely conserved; heating did not extend average species flowering into the latter part of the growing season but instead flowering was completed earlier in heated plots. Although passive warming experiments have resulted in warming‐induced soil drying suggested to advance flower senescence, supplemental water did not counteract the average species advance in flowering senescence caused by heating or extend flowering in unheated plots, and variation in soil moisture had inconsistent effects on flowering periods. Functional groups differed in sensitivity to earlier snowmelt, with flower initiation most advanced for early‐season species and flowering duration lengthened only for graminoids and forbs. We conclude that earlier snowmelt, driven by increased radiative heating, is the most important factor altering alpine flowering phenology. Studies that only manipulate summer temperature will err in estimating the sensitivity of alpine flowering phenology to large‐scale warming. The wholesale advance in flowering phenology with earlier snowmelt suggests that alpine communities will track warming, but only alpine forbs and graminoids appear able to take advantage of an extended snow‐free season.  aPublisher supplied data  aDE‐FG02‐07ER64457cUS Department of Energy, Office of Science 3aalpine tundra 3aclimate change 3aflowering 3aflowers 3aforbs 3agraminoids 3aheat 3aphenology 3asnowmelt 3asoil water 3aspring 3asummer 3atemperature1 aWinkler, Daniel E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4825-90731 aKueppers, Lara M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8134-35790 tEcology.g2020 Sept., v. 101, no. 9 p.e03108-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl46164x0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecy.31083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02456naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100004100148245014300189300001600332520112200348592002801470650001401498650002001512650001801532650001401550650002201564653003201586653002301618653002201641653004901663653002701712700002001739700001901759700002101778700002001799700002201819773012501841856008301966852000902049655001202058IND60674802620221118033626.0200228e20200215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067480262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2019.10.0862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ada Silva, Rafael Leonardo Cruz Gomes10aSurface chemistry and spectroscopic studies of the native phenylalanine dehydrogenase Langmuir monolayer at the air/aqueous NaCl interface  ap. 458-466.  aThis study investigates the main aspects of the surface behavior of the native phenylalanine dehydrogenase (PheDH) enzyme at the air/aqueous interface employing a saline subphase to induce the enzyme surface activity.

It was found that the PheDH enzyme forms a fluid film, which is quite homogeneous throughout its entire compression, being stable for long periods of time with no significant evidence of aggregates or irreversible domains during interfacial compression/decompression processes. The main secondary structures of the interfacial PheDH film were accessed via in situ reflectance-absorbance infrared spectroscopy, indicating a majority presence of α-helices, which were maintained after the film transfer to solid muscovite supports.

A few studies have been performed to evaluate the diversity and co-occurrence patterns of rhizosphere microbiomes in soybean (Glycine max) at a regional scale. Here, we used a culture-independent method to compare the bacterial communities of the soybean rhizosphere between Nebraska (NE), a high-yield state, and Oklahoma (OK), a low-yield state. It is well known that the rhizosphere microbiome is a subset of microbes that ultimately get colonized by microbial communities from the surrounding bulk soil. Therefore, we hypothesized that differences in the soybean yield are attributed to the variations in the rhizosphere microbes at taxonomic, functional, and community levels. In addition, soil physicochemical properties were also evaluated from each sampling site for comparative study. Our result showed that distinct clusters were formed between NE and OK in terms of their soil physicochemical property. Among 3 primary nutrients (i.e., nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium), potassium is more positively correlated with the high-yield state NE samples. We also attempted to identify keystone communities that significantly affected the soybean yield using co-occurrence network patterns. Network analysis revealed that communities formed distinct clusters in which members of modules having significantly positive correlations with the soybean yield were more abundant in NE than OK. In addition, we identified the most influential bacteria for the soybean yield in the identified modules. For instance, included are class Anaerolineae, family Micromonosporaceae, genus Plantomyces, and genus Nitrospira in the most complex module (ME9) and genus Rhizobium in ME23. This research would help to further identify a way to increase soybean yield in low-yield states in the U.S. as well as worldwide by reconstructing the microbial communities in the rhizosphere.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGlycine max 3aMicromonosporaceae 3aRhizobium 3acomparative study 3acrop yield 3amicrobiology 3amicrobiome 3anitrogen 3aphosphorus 3aplant growth 3apotassium 3arhizosphere 3asoil 3asoybeans 3aNebraska 3aOklahoma1 aRose, Meaghan1 aChang, Woo-Suk0 tjournal of microbiology.g2022 Oct., v. 60, no. 10 p.986-997dThe Microbiological Society of KoreawJournal:jnl4619042x1976-37947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12275-022-2363-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03640naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005900150245010600209300001400315520173300329592002802062650001502090650001802105650002202123650001102145650001102156650001002167650001502177650001902192650002102211650001002232650001702242650001202259650001302271650001102284650002002295650001702315650002302332650002002355650001202375650001602387650001102403651001202414651001702426653002102443653002202464653002402486653002002510653001202530700006102542700002202603700002202625700002402647700001902671700002402690700002602714700002102740700001702761773010602778856008502884852000902969655001202978IND60684713020221122131538.0200517e20200320xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068471302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.quaint.2020.02.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarobene, Daria1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7903-118113aAn interdisciplinary study of a mammoth-bearing Late Pleistocene sediment succession in lower Austria  ap. 15-29.  aIn the Alpine foreland and the Vienna Basin loess-paleosol sequences (LPS) are common. Some of the most famous LPS sites in the circum-Alpine area include Stratzing, Göttweig, Willendorf, Krems-Wachtberg, and Stillfried, which cluster in a relatively small area along the Danube river in Lower Austria. LPS provide detailed insights into climate-driven, terrestrial palaeoenvironmental changes that can be placed into a robust chronological framework, because LPS are amenable to a range of dating techniques. Here, we present a well-dated 13.6 m-thick mammoth-bearing sediment succession characterised by low-energy aquatic deposits, sheet-flow deposits and sandy loess from re-deposited Miocene sediments, i.e. a depositional environment that contrasts to the classical LPS sites. This new site is situated 1.6 km NNE of Bullendorf in Lower Austria, where Pleistocene sediment successions with a robust chronology are rare. Our multidisciplinary approach is based on optically stimulated luminescence and ¹⁴C dating, and includes mammal faunal investigations and stable isotope analyses of molluscs. OSL and ¹⁴C dating suggest deposition of the sediment sequence immediately before and briefly after the Last Glacial Maximum. The mollusc assemblages and the mammal fauna are representative of a cold climate, characteristic of a tundra steppe environment. Stratigraphic changes in δ¹⁸O of two mollusc species (Pupilla muscorum and Succinella oblonga) suggest an alternating dry-cold and humid-cold climate. Oxygen isotope data of freshwater gastropod shells suggest a drastic decrease in the mean growing season temperature compared to today, while the carbon isotope composition is indicative of a C3 vegetation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGastropoda 3aMiocene epoch 3aPleistocene epoch 3abasins 3acarbon 3afauna 3afreshwater 3agrowing season 3aisotope labeling 3aloess 3aluminescence 3amammals 3amolluscs 3aoxygen 3aoxygen isotopes 3apaleoecology 3aradiocarbon dating 3astable isotopes 3asteppes 3atemperature 3atundra 3aAustria 3aDanube River 0aLate pleistocene 0aPalaeoenvironment 0aLuminescence dating 0aStable isotopes 0aAustria1 aMeyer, Michael C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6677-74191 aSpötl, Christoph1 aRötzel, Reinhard1 aGöhlich, Ursula B.1 aMandić, Oleg,1 aHarzhauser, Mathias1 aWimmer-Frey, Ingeborg1 aReimer, Paula J.1 aAuer, Fabian0 tQuaternary international.g2020 Mar. 20, v. 542 p.15-29dElsevier LtdwJournal:12411x1040-61827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2020.02.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02219naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002800140245013100168500001900299520108000318592002801398650001201426650001601438650001601454650001101470650001201481650001601493651001101509651001201520700003201532700002701564700003401591700002701625773012201652856007401774852000901848655001201857IND60732169420221122194356.0210326e20210311xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073216942DNAL7 a10.3390/nu130309102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIzydorczyk, Bernadetta 10aPsychological Risk Factors for the Development of Restrictive and Bulimic Eating Behaviors: A Polish and Vietnamese Comparison  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe aim of this paper is to identify psychological factors which are culture specific or common predictors for restrictive and bulimic behaviors towards eating for young women raised in different cultures. The study included 661 young women from Poland (n = 233) and Vietnam (n = 428). Subjects filled-in the Eating Disorders Inventory (EDI-3) and the Multidimensional Body-Self Relations Questionnaire-Appearance Scales (MBSRQ-AS), and body measurements were collected to calculate anthropometric indices. Women form Vietnam were less satisfied with their appearance than were their Polish peers, but Vietnamese showed a lower level of preoccupation with being overweight and fear of obesity. Intercultural differences indicate that Vietnamese women show greater intensities for psychological variables, connected with restrictive and bulimic eating behaviors, verified in the research model: low self-esteem, personal alienation, interpersonal insecurity, interpersonal alienation, emotional dysregulation, interoceptive deficits, perfectionism and asceticism, and anxiety.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanxiety 3afearfulness 3ainventories 3amodels 3aobesity 3aself-esteem 3aPoland 3aVietnam1 aTrương, Thị Khánh Hà,1 aLipowska, Małgorzata 1 aSitnik-Warchulska, Katarzyna 1 aLizińczyk, Sebastian 0 tNutrients.g2021 Mar. 11, v. 13, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu130309103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02356naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245010600167300001600273520119000289592002801479650003001507650002001537650001201557650002401569650001001593650002101603650001501624650001101639650001101650650001201661650001601673650002901689650001101718700001901729700001801748773010201766856008101868852000901949655001201958IND50073663420221119091340.0150213e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007366342DNAL7 a10.1007/s10333-013-0385-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Ching-Wen10aOptimal fallow area and location for multifunctional benefits of a paddy field during drought periods  ap. 319-333.  aPaddy fields not only serve to produce food but also have a variety of important ecological functions. Apart from the internal benefit (i.e., crop production), there are external benefits (i.e., reduction of greenhouse gases, oxygen generation, reduction of biological oxygen demand, flood mitigation, and other functions that are difficult to quantify). In the present study, the optimal fallow locations and areas were determined for evaluating the multifunctional benefits of paddy fields during drought periods, by using an optimization model for fallow fields under different exceedance probabilities of river inflows. For each time step, the appropriate probability distributions for river inflows to the Chi-Chi Weir (range 50–90 %) for generating system inflows were obtained. The optimization model for fallow fields was solved using Lingo. It was observed that the external benefits of paddy fields accounted for 76 % of total benefits, with the production benefit accounting for the remainder. The total benefits decreased as the exceedance probability of river discharges increased. Our findings indicate that fallow areas increase as irrigation areas shift downstream.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiochemical oxygen demand 3acrop production 3adrought 3aecological function 3afoods 3agreenhouse gases 3airrigation 3amodels 3aoxygen 3apaddies 3aprobability 3aprobability distribution 3arivers1 aXu, Niansheng,1 aWu, Chieh-Shu0 tPaddy and water environment.g2014 Apr., v. 12, no. 2 p.319-333dSpringer-Verlagx1611-24907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10333-013-0385-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03734naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245014900171520202900320592002802349650001302377650002402390650003002414650002502444650002702469650001402496650001302510650001302523650001102536650001102547650001102558650002302569650002202592650002702614650001802641650002502659651001302684653002602697653001402723653001202737653002502749653001702774653001902791700001802810700002002828700003402848700001802882700002002900700002002920700002002940773011302960856008603073852000903159655001203168IND60687943220221121042048.0200809e20200720xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068794322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1213612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYap, Cheau Chin10aComparison of different industrial scale palm oil mill effluent anaerobic systems in degradation of organic contaminants and kinetic performance  aPalm oil mill effluent has been extensively researched via three different technologies, namely chemical, physicochemical and biological treatment methods. Biological treatment by anaerobic and aerobic means is currently the most commonly used method for palm oil mill effluent. However, the greatest challenge posed by them is the inconsistent biological oxygen demand of 20 mg/L for the final treated effluent. Large amount of investment for additional polishing plant prior to the final discharge has been utilised intentionally to further reduce the biochemical oxygen demand values, but the problem remains unresolved. The performance of current palm oil mill effluent treatment system deployed by the industry was evaluated by comparing two different types of anaerobic treatments: open ponding and covered lagoon systems (with hydraulic and gas mixing). The covered lagoon with hydraulic mixing achieved the highest chemical oxygen demand, total suspended solids, total volatile solids and lignin removal efficiencies of >80% compared to other systems which showed <50% removal. Sufficient hydraulic retention time, extended aeration system coupled with presence of pure aerobic microbial cells in the stabilisation pond were able to produce effluent that abided the final discharge limit of biochemical oxygen demand 20 mg/L. Stover-Kincannon, Monod Contois and Grau second-order kinetic models were applied to the chemical oxygen demand data obtained to gauge the performance of anaerobic treatment of covered lagoon system with hydraulic mixing. The modified Stover-Kincannon model was found to define the system most appropriately with R² of 0.9767. This work provided an up-to-date and representative palm oil mill effluent characteristics and contaminants degradation performance of the three commonly used palm oil mill effluent treatment methods in Malaysia. It helps in method selection and equipment sizing for palm oil mill effluent as well as other industrial-scale wastewater treatment and management.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaeration 3aanaerobic treatment 3abiochemical oxygen demand 3abiological treatment 3achemical oxygen demand 3aequipment 3aindustry 3akinetics 3alignin 3amixing 3amodels 3aoil mill effluents 3apollution control 3atotal suspended solids 3awaste lagoons 3awastewater treatment 3aMalaysia 0aPalm oil mil effluent 0aAnaerobic 0aAerobic 0aWastewater treatment 0aOpen ponding 0aCovered lagoon1 aChan, Yi Jing1 aLoh, Soh Kheang1 aSupramaniam, Christina Vimala1 aSoh, Aik Chin1 aChong, Mei Fong1 aChew, Chien Lye1 aLim, Lian Keong0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2020 July 20, v. 262 p.121361-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1213613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03789naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002700148245012600175300001100301520253300312592002802845596008802873650001902961650002202980650002903002650001403031650002603045650001603071650005003087650000903137650001803146651001603164700002203180773013303202856008303335852000903418655001203427IND60794807820221117223331.0221002e202212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079480782DNAL7 a10.1186/s12302-022-00676-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodríguez-Leal, Inés14aThe applicability domain of EPI Suite™ for screening phytotoxins for potential to contaminate source water for drinking  ap. 96.  aBACKGROUND: Toxins produced by plants constitute a potential threat to water supplies in Europe, but have not been widely considered in systematic risk assessments. One way to begin to address potential risks of phytotoxins is to conduct screening-level assessments of known phytotoxins for their potential to contaminate source water for drinking due to persistence (P) and mobility (M). Chemical properties relevant for such an assessment (octanol–water partition coefficient KOW and biodegradation half-life) can be estimated from the structure of phytotoxins with quantitative structure–property relationship (QSPR) models found in the United States Environmental Protection Agency’s Estimation Program Interface (EPI Suite™) software, but predictions must be considered critically since these models have been developed using data for anthropogenic chemicals and many phytotoxins could lie outside their applicability domain. RESULTS: We analyzed two EPI Suite™ models—KOWWIN and BIOWIN5—by evaluating the quality of property predictions for their validation sets as a function of Euclidean distances dE to the centroid of descriptor space of the models’ training sets. We identified model-specific applicability domain boundaries as local maxima in plots of the difference between root mean square error (∆RMSE) of modeled property values of validation set compounds within and outside applicability domain boundaries defined by a continuum of possible boundaries. And, we also evaluated four generic boundaries that have been suggested in literature. The ∆RMSE between validation set compounds outside and inside applicability domain boundaries had positive values for all but one of the possible boundaries we considered, indicating that properties of chemicals with dE inside the boundaries were better predicted. With our proposed model-specific boundaries, 21% of 1586 phytotoxins produced by plants found in Switzerland were out of domain of KOWWIN, and 46% of were out of domain of BIOWIN5. CONCLUSIONS: Estimates of Log KOW and biodegradation half-life of phytotoxins that lie outside the domain of applicability of the QSPR models should be viewed as extrapolations that are subject to unquantified and potentially large errors. Phytotoxins outside the domain of applicability of QSPR models should be prioritized for property measurements as a basis to expand the training sets of QSPR models and to support hazard identification for better management of drinking water quality in Europe.  aPublisher supplied data  aMarie Sklodowska-Curie grant agreement No. 722493cHorizon 2020 Framework Programme 3abiodegradation 3acomputer software 3aenvironmental protection 3ahalf life 3ahazard identification 3aphytotoxins 3aquantitative structure-activity relationships 3arisk 3awater quality 3aSwitzerland1 aMacleod, Matthew,0 tEnvironmental sciences Europe.g2022 Dec., v. 34, no. 1 p.96-96dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000001276x2190-47077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12302-022-00676-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02738naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245010100166300001200267520157900279592002801858650001301886650001601899650003001915650001901945650002201964650001501986650001402001650001702015650001902032651002102051700002102072700002102093700002302114773013502137856008302272852000902355655001202364IND60794807920221117223344.0221002e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079480792DNAL7 a10.1007/s12665-022-10579-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, Somvir10aCharacterization of the groundwater quality in Udham Singh Nagar of Kumaun Himalaya, Uttarakhand  ap. 468.  aThe Udham Singh Nagar district is affluent in fertile land and water resources and even favoured for industrial advancement, resulting in a rapid increase of industrialization and urban growth, which are the inevitable causes of groundwater contamination. In recent years the increased rate of urbanization and Integrated Industrial Estate (IIE) in Pantnagar, Kashipur and Sitarganj area (of the district) have increased the demand for groundwater. Proper groundwater resource planning and monitoring on a regional scale are required to cope with the pace of rapid urbanization and industrialization along with dire irrigation needs. To suffice this strategy, the spatial distribution of water quality shall determine the sustainable approach to be implemented in an area. This research aims to assess the hydrochemical quality of the groundwater in Udham Singh Nagar district (areal extent 3055 Km²), Uttarakhand. The groundwater samples collected from the aquifer have shown anomalous values of Total Hardness (TH), Total Dissolved Solids (TDS), Magnesium (Mg²⁺), Iron (Fe), and Lead (Pb²⁺) on undergoing major elemental analysis, which confirms degradation in the groundwater quality. Moreover, the Piper Trilinear Diagram (PTD) has identified groundwater's hydrochemical facies and characterization. Based on the interpretation of TDS, most groundwater samples < 500 mg/L of dissolved solids, making it desirable for drinking. Therefore, this phenomenon attributes to suitable drinking water present in the aquifer of Udham Singh Nagar district, Uttarakhand.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3agroundwater 3agroundwater contamination 3ahydrochemistry 3aindustrialization 3airrigation 3amagnesium 3aurbanization 3awater hardness 3aHimalayan region1 aGautam, Param K.1 aSarkar, Tandrila1 aTaloor, Ajay Kumar0 tEnvironmental earth sciences.g2022 Oct., v. 81, no. 19 p.468-468dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000001228x1866-62807nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-022-10579-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03499naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003600113040001800149100001600167245016100183300001800344520151600362592002801878650002301906650000801929650002501937650001201962650001601974650001401990650001802004650001702022650001002039650002002049650001002069650003602079650004802115650001202163650003402175650003302209650006002242650001502302650005302317650002102370650002702391650002602418650005102444650001002495650004902505653000902554653002402563653001102587653001202598700001902610700001302629700001802642773013302660856008302793852000902876655001202885IND60114105920221120163114.0190318e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011410592DNAL7 a240115942pmid7 a10.1016/j.rvsc.2013.08.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLv, Yingjun10aActivation of NF-κB contributes to production of pig-major acute protein and serum amyloid A in pigs experimentally infected with porcine circovirus type 2  ap. 1235-1240.  aAcute phase proteins (APPs) have protective and regulatory roles in the inflammatory response. Previous studies indicate that APPs in serum change after pigs are infected with porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2), but the mechanisms underlying APP production have remained unclear. In this present study, 35-day-old pigs were challenged with PCV2 and responses compared to an uninfected control group. To investigate the concentrations of APPs in serum and the activity of NF-κB in the liver, five pigs in the PCV2-infected group were euthanized at 14, 21 and 35days post inoculation (dpi) while four pigs were sacrificed in the control group at 0, 14, 21 and 35days, respectively. The concentrations of pig-major acute protein (Pig-MAP), C-reactive protein (CRP) and serum amyloid A (SAA) in infected animals were increased at 14 and 21dpi, while the concentration of alpha-1 acid glycoprotein (AGP) was lower at 35dpi, indicating that PCV2 induced the production of APPs. Moreover, the DNA binding activity of NF-κB and expression levels of NF-κB p65 subunit (NF-κB p65) from the cytoplasm to nucleus were increased at 14 and 21dpi in the liver of infected pigs, while the phosphorylation of IκBα (p-IκBα) in the liver was also increased at 21dpi. This demonstrated that PCV2 infection induced the activation of NF-κB. Both SAA and Pig-MAP concentrations correlated significantly with expression levels of NF-κB p65, indicating that activation of NF-κB contributes to the production of SAA and Pig-MAP.  aPublisher supplied data 3aC-reactive protein 3aDNA 3aPorcine circovirus-2 3aamyloid 3ablood serum 3acytoplasm 3aglycoproteins 3ainflammation 3aliver 3aphosphorylation 3aswine 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 2aAcute-Phase Proteinsxanalysisxphysiology. 2aAnimals 2aBlotting, Westernxveterinary 2aC-Reactive Proteinxanalysis 2aCircoviridae Infectionsxbloodximmunologyxveterinary. 2aCircovirus 2aElectrophoretic Mobility Shift Assayxveterinary 2aLiverxchemistry 2aNF-kappa Bxphysiology 2aOrosomucoidxanalysis 2aSerum Amyloid A Proteinxanalysisxphysiology. 2aSwine 2aSwine Diseasesxbloodximmunologyxvirology. 0aPCV2 0aAcute phase protein 0aNF-κB 0aPorcine1 aZhang, Xiujuan1 aSun, Yun1 aZhang, Shuxia0 tResearch in veterinary science.g2013 Dec., v. 95, no. 3 p.1235-1240dElsevier India Pvt Ltd.wJournal:jnl45491x0034-52887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rvsc.2013.08.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02376naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245008900175300001800264500001900282520102600301536009201327592002801419596001501447650001801462650001801480650002101498650001201519650001801531650001201549650000901561650001301570650002001583653001201603653001801615653001601633700001901649700002101668700001801689773014001707856008601847852000901933655001201942IND60716599420221121035645.0210101e20201201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071659942DNAL7 a10.1080/09168451.2020.18141272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIshiuchi-Sato, Yuri14aThe effects of glucose and fatty acids on CXCL10 expression in skeletal muscle cells  ap. 2448-2457.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSkeletal muscles produce secretory factors termed as myokines, which alter physiological functions of target tissues. We recently identified C-X-C chemokine ligand 10 (CXCL10) as a novel myokine, which is downregulated in response to exercise. In the present study, we investigated whether the nutritional changes affect CXCL10 expression in mouse skeletal muscle. Expression of CXCL10 was evaluated in mice fed a normal diet or a high fat diet for 10 weeks. In animals fed on HFD, Cxcl10 expression was significantly induced in fast-twitched muscles, and was accompanied by increased blood glucose and free fatty acid levels. In vitro experiments using C2C12 myotubes suggested that the increased levels of glucose and palmitic acids directly enhanced CXCL10 expression. Interestingly, the effect of palmitic acids was attenuated by palmitoleic acids. Considering its potent angiostatic activity, induction of CXCL10 by nutritional changes may contribute to the impairment of microvascular networks in skeletal muscles.  aThis work was supported by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [C-19K06442].  aPublisher supplied data  aC-19K06442 3abiotechnology 3ablood glucose 3afree fatty acids 3aglucose 3ahigh fat diet 3aligands 3amice 3amyotubes 3askeletal muscle 0aMyokine 0ahigh-fat Diet 0afatty acids1 aHiraiwa, Erika1 aShinozaki, Ayaka1 aNedachi, Taku0 tBioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry.g2020 Dec. 01, v. 84, no. 12 p.2448-2457dTaylor & FranciswJournal:18959x1347-69477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09168451.2020.18141273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03469naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245008500166300001800251520140500269592002801674650002301702650002701725650002601752650001301778650003001791650003101821650002801852650002501880650001801905650001801923650002301941650001501964650002101979650001402000650002502014650001702039650001802056650002102074650001902095650002202114650001102136650001802147650001902165650001002184650001702194650001402211650000702225650001402232650001102246650001502257650002202272653001402294653002502308653002902333653002302362653002202385700002002407700001902427700001602446700001802462700005902480773013002539856008102669852000902750655001202759IND60540115920221123043943.0190318e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054011592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2015.07.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Na-Kyoung10aMultifunctional effect of probiotic Lactococcus lactis KC24 isolated from kimchi  ap. 1036-1041.  aThe probiotic properties of Lactococcus lactis KC24 isolated from kimchi were studied. L. lactis KC24 retained activity in artificial gastric juice (pH 3.0, 0.1% pepsin for 2 h) and bile acid (0.1% oxgall for 24 h). This strain did not produce the carcinogenic enzyme, β-glucuronidase. L. lactis KC24 adhered strongly to Caco-2 cells (16.62% and 18.44% of cell adherence and high hydrophobicity, respectively). Antimicrobial effects of L. lactis KC24 were studied by the competition with other microorganisms to adhere to intestinal epithelial cells. L. lactis KC24 inhibited the adhesion of 6 pathogens (3 Listeria monocytogenes strains and 3 Staphylococcus aureus strains) to the mucus layer. The anti-inflammatory effect of L. lactis KC24 was demonstrated through the reduction of nitric oxide in the lipopolysaccharide-induced production. The antioxidant effect determined through ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) and inhibition of β-carotene and linoleic acid oxidation was significant with a much higher FRAP value than that observed for ascorbic acid (1 mg/mL). The anticancer effect was observed against gastric carcinoma (AGS), colon carcinoma (HT-29 and LoVo), breast carcinoma (MCF-7), and lung carcinoma (SK-MES-1) cells (>50% cytotoxicity). These results indicate that L. lactis KC24 could potentially be used in the formulation of multifunctional probiotics products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLactococcus lactis 3aListeria monocytogenes 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aadhesion 3aanti-infective properties 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3aantineoplastic activity 3aantioxidant activity 3aascorbic acid 3abeta-carotene 3abeta-glucuronidase 3abile acids 3abreast neoplasms 3acarcinoma 3acolorectal neoplasms 3acytotoxicity 3agastric juice 3ahuman cell lines 3ahydrophobicity 3aintestinal mucosa 3akimchi 3alinoleic acid 3alung neoplasms 3amucus 3anitric oxide 3aoxidation 3apH 3apathogens 3apepsin 3aprobiotics 3astomach neoplasms 0aProbiotic 0aAntimicrobial effect 0aAnti-inflammatory effect 0aAntioxidant effect 0aAnticancer effect1 aHan, Kyoung Jun1 aSon, Sŭng-ho,1 aEom, Su Jin1 aLee, Si-Kyung1 aPaik, Hyun-Dong1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9891-77030 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2015 Dec., v. 64, no. 2 p.1036-1041dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2015.07.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02913naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245010100170520161300271592002801884650001101912650001501923650001901938650002001957650001501977650001401992650002602006650001302032650002002045651001002065653003002075653002602105653002002131653001802151653001302169700001802182700001502200700001302215700001502228700001602243773011302259856008602372852000902458655001202467IND60687943620221121021244.0200809e20200720xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068794362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1213662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiao, Shijiang10aPolicy impacts on Municipal Solid Waste management in Shanghai: A system dynamics model analysis  aShanghai is the first city to implement Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) sorting regulation in China, and it also has policies on economy, demography, MSW collection and treatment. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the impacts of these polices on MSW management for Shanghai. System dynamics model is a prevailing method to simulate impacts of various policies on MSW management from a dynamic and complex perspective. Besides, different from existing studies that consider only a certain process of MSW management, our system dynamic model simulate the entire process of MSW production, sorting, collection and final treatment. Seven scenarios are set to simulate the impacts of these policies. Results show that economic policy has great impact on future MSW management. MSW generation in 2035 will decline by 3.25 Million tonnes if Gross Domestic Production growth rate decrease by 1%. Demographic policy will reduce MSW generation per capita, but increase the total amount of MSW generation. MSW sorting policy will decrease total demand of MSW landfill, but soar the demand of food waste treatment facility. Treatment method policy will not play a big role in decreasing total demand of MSW landfill. Finally, policy implications including prudent economic and demographic policy, strengthening biochemical treatment capacity and comprehensive utilization of residues are proposed. It is anticipated that this system dynamic model and policy implications can contribute to the MSW management of other 45 Chinese cities that are planning to implement sorting regulation soon, or even other global cities.  aPublisher supplied data 3acities 3ademography 3adynamic models 3aeconomic policy 3afood waste 3alandfills 3amunicipal solid waste 3aplanning 3awaste treatment 3aChina 0aSystem dynamics modelling 0aMunicipal solid waste 0aGarbage sorting 0aPolicy impact 0aShanghai1 aDong, Huijuan1 aGeng, Yong1 aTian, Xu1 aLiu, Chang1 aLi, Haifeng0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2020 July 20, v. 262 p.121366-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1213663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02439naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002400140245017100164500001900335520151400354592002801868650001301896650002901909650001501938650001501953773012201968856007402090852000902164655001202173IND60732169920221122162600.0210326e20210312xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073216992DNAL7 a10.3390/nu130309152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNakajima, Nobuhisa 10aDifferential Diagnosis of Cachexia and Refractory Cachexia and the Impact of Appropriate Nutritional Intervention for Cachexia on Survival in Terminal Cancer Patients  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aCancer cachexia subsequently shifts to refractory cachexia, however, it is not easy to properly differentiate them in clinical settings. Patients considered refractory cachexia may include cachectic patients with starvation. This study aimed to identify these cachectic patients and to evaluate the effect of nutritional intervention for them. Study subjects were terminal cancer patients admitted for palliative care and were judged refractory cachexia in the last five years. We retrospectively examined to find useful indices for identifying such cachectic patients and for evaluating the effect of nutritional intervention. Out of 223 patients in refractory cachexia, 26 were diagnosed cachexia with starvation after symptom management. Comparing before and one week after this management, Palliative Performance Scale (PPS) and transthyretin significantly improved (p < 0.0001, p = 0.0002, respectively) Then, we started nutritional intervention for these cachectic patients and divided into effective group (n = 17) and non-effective group (n = 9) using the criteria for cachexia. Comparing between the two groups, PPS significantly improved2 weeks after intervention in effective group (p = 0.006). Survival time was significantly longer in effective group (p = 0.008). PPS and transthyretin were useful for differential diagnosis of cachexia and refractory cachexia. PPS was useful for evaluating nutritional intervention for cachectic patients. Appropriate nutritional intervention improved survival.  aPublisher supplied data 3acachexia 3anutritional intervention 3aprealbumin 3astarvation0 tNutrients.g2021 Mar. 12, v. 13, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu130309153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02377naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002300142245019700165300001800362520074100380592002801121650001101149650001401160650002301174650002101197650001701218650001801235650001301253650000801266700002401274700006601298700006401364700006301428700006301491700005801554700006201612700006201674773014601736856007601882852000901958655001201967IND60683930720200904000000.0200213e20200128xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068393072DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.9b133132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Hsiang-Sheng10aPreserving the Exposed Facets of Pt₃Sn Intermetallic Nanocubes During an Order to Disorder Transition Allows the Elucidation of the Effect of the Degree of Alloy Ordering on Electrocatalysis  ap. 3231-3239.  aControlling which facets are exposed in nanocrystals is crucial to understanding different activity between ordered and disordered alloy electrocatalysts. We modify the degree of ordering of Pt₃Sn nanocubes, while maintaining the shape and size, to enable a direct evaluation of the effect of the order on ORR catalytic activity. We demonstrate a 2.3-fold enhancement in specific activity by 60- and 30%-ordered Pt₃Sn nanocubes compared to 95%-ordered. This was shown to be likely due to surface vacancies in the less-ordered particles. The greater order, however, results in higher stability of the electrocatalyst, with the more disordered nanoparticles showing the dissolution of tin and platinum species during electrocatalysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalloys 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3aelectrochemistry 3ananocrystals 3ananoparticles 3aplatinum 3atin1 aBenedetti, Tania M.1 aGonçales, Vinicius R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1288-19871 aBedford, Nicholas M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4424-70941 aScott, Robert W.

The amino acid composition, structural characteristics, physicochemical and functional properties as well as antioxidant activities of the hydrolysate were compared with those of unmodified DWPG-1. The analysis of X-ray diffraction patterns, surface microstructure and particle size distribution indicated that enzymatic hydrolysis changed the structures of DWPG-1. Compared with the natural unhydrolyzed protein, the hydrolysate showed better physicochemical properties, such as surface hydrophobicity, solubility, emulsifying properties, foaming properties and water absorption capacity. In addition, the hydrolysate also exhibited significantly stronger antioxidant activities than DWPG-1. In conclusion, the results of this study prove that pepsin-mediated hydrolysis of walnut glutelin-1 can effectively modify the structure, function and antioxidant activity of DWPG-1, and could be used as an effective technology to produce bioactive multifunctional hydrolysates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aamino acid composition 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3ahydrolysates 3ahydrolysis 3ahydrophobicity 3amicrostructure 3aparticle size distribution 3apepsin 3asolubility 3awalnuts 3awater binding capacity1 aWang, Guoliang1 aChen, Ning1 aAn, Feiran1 aZhang, Runguang1 aZhang, Yufeng1 aRahman, Mati Ur1 aZhang, Youlin0 tRSC advances.g2021 May 26, v. 11, no. 31 p.19158-19168dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1ra00657f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02667naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005800142245008900200300001800289520143900307592002801746650003001774650002101804650001901825650001601844650003701860700001601897700001601913700005801929700005301987700005802040773014602098856007602244852000902320655001202329IND60683930820221117172116.0200213e20200123xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068393082DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.9b134462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Han-Yue1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6718-066510aNarrow Band Gap Observed in a Molecular Ferroelastic: Ferrocenium Tetrachloroferrate  ap. 3240-3245.  aDue to the intriguing chemical variability and structure–property flexibility, molecular materials with striking multifunctional characteristics, including tunable physical, chemical, optical, and electronic properties, have aroused wide attention. Recently, great advances have also been made in designing molecular ferroelastics with optoelectronic properties. However, the band gaps of the most typical ferroelastics are far in excess of 2.0 eV, which severely hinder their further applications. And this corresponds to the inherent incompatibility of ferroelastics. Herein we report an organometallic compound, ferrocenium tetrachloroferrate (1), undergoing a ferroelastic phase transition at 407.7 K with a large spontaneous strain of 0.1088. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first molecular ferroelastic with such a high Curie temperature (Tc) and narrow band gap of 1.61 eV. UV–vis absorption spectra and density-functional theory (DFT) calculation confirm this band gap. The band gap of 1 is determined by both the ferrocenium and the tetrachloroferrate components. The ideal semiconducting characteristic makes a breakthrough in the inherent incompatibility with ferroelastics. This will inspire an intriguing and further research in molecular ferroelastics with ideal semiconductor characteristics and hold great potential for the utilization in optoelectronic devices, especially the photovoltaic applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3adensity functional theory 3aphase transition 3asemiconductors 3atemperature 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy1 aHu, Chun-Li1 aHu, Zhao-Bo1 aMao, Jiang-Gao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5101-88981 aSong, You1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0289-78301 aXiong, Ren-Gen1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2364-01930 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2020 Jan. 23, v. 142, no. 6 p.3240-3245dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.9b134463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02229naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245015000158300002000308500001900328520076500347592002801112650001301140650002201153650001701175650002301192650002401215650001101239650002301250650001701273650002101290650001201311650001601323650001401339700001801353700001601371700002401387700001701411700001801428700002201446700002401468700002101492700002701513773012401540856007401664852000901738655001201747IND60739474820221123044114.0210529e20210524xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073947482DNAL7 a10.1039/d1ra00997d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchalk, Felix10aGNPS-guided discovery of xylacremolide C and D, evaluation of their putative biosynthetic origin and bioactivity studies of xylacremolide A and B  ap. 18748-18756.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aTargeted HRMS²-GNPS-based metabolomic analysis of Pseudoxylaria sp.

In plant biology, fitness is often measured as seed count. However, under an array of circumstances, seed count may be a biased proxy of fitness, for example when individuals vary in allocation to sexual versus asexual reproduction. A more subtle example, but also likely to be important in natural populations, is when interindividual variation in conditions during development results in variation in offspring quality among seed parents. In monocarpic (semelparous) plants, this is expected to result from variation in effective season length experienced among individuals that reach reproductive maturity at different times. Here, we manipulate growing season length to ask whether seed count is an accurate representation of parental fitness in the monocarpic herb Lobelia inflata. Simple seed count suggests a paradoxical fitness advantage under constrained‐season length. However, we find that the apparent fitness advantage of a constrained‐season length is overridden by low relative per‐seed fitness. Furthermore, the fitness deficit in the constrained environment is associated primarily with an accelerating decrease in viability and seedling survival in seeds derived from fruits produced progressively later in the season. In this study, the overall fitness value of a seed under a constrained season is 0.774 of that observed under a long season.  aPublisher supplied data  aRGPIN‐2015‐03922cNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada 3aLobelia inflata 3aasexual reproduction 3aevolutionary biology 3aphenology 3aprogeny 3aseedlings 3asexual maturity 3aviability1 aSimons, Andrew M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0198-465X0 tJournal of evolutionary biology.g2020 Aug., v. 33, no. 8 p.1039-1049dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3867076x1010-061X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jeb.136333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03203naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245011200166500001900278520183700297592002802134650000802162650002002170650002002190650001302210650001202223650002002235650001102255650001002266650001602276650001802292650001402310653002202324653001402346653000702360653001902367653000802386653000702394653000802401700001702409700001502426700001402441700001502455700001702470700001802487773009702505856008602602852000902688655001202697IND60691280420221121034644.0210203e20170101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069128042DNAL7 a10.1080/23312025.2017.13749192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSomjen, D.10aMutual modulation of femarelle and vitamin D analog activities in human derived female cultured osteoblasts  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIntroduction: Pre-, post-menopausal, and male human osteoblasts (hObs) express estradiol-17β (E₂) receptors α and β (ERα, ERβ), vitamin D receptor (VDR), and 25-hydroxy vitamin D₃ 1-α hydroxylase (1OHase) and produce 1,25 (OH)₂D₃ (1,25D). Pre-treatment with JKF (JKF 1624F₂–₂) up-regulated estrogenic responsiveness, via modulation of ERs expression and E₂ binding. These estrogens induce VDR and 1OHase expression and 1,25D production. Purpose: Compared the effects of femarelle (F) to daidzein (D) and E₂ by themselves and their modulation by JKF. Methods: hObs derived from human bones at different ages and sex were cultured, treated with different hormones and analyzed for the different parameters. Results: (1) F, D and E₂ stimulated ³[H] thymidine incorporation (DNA) and creatine kinase specific activity (CK) in female but not in male hObs. The responses to E₂ and to D unlike to F were up-regulated by JKF. (2) All hormones increased ERα and decreased ERβ mRNA in all hObs. (3) JKF modulated in different ways the expressions of ERα and ERβ mRNA in all hObs. (4) JKF did not significantly modulate the expressions of ERα and ERβ mRNA in all hObs. (5) JKF increased intracellular competitive binding of E₂ by all hormones only in female hObs. (6) Pre-treatment with all hormones increased VDR and 1OHase expression and 1,25D formation in pre- and post-, but only JKF modulated it in male hObs. Conclusions: F, D and E₂ increase different parameters in hObs. However, pre-treatment with JKF modulates the effect of E₂ and D but not of F. F reciprocally modulates mRNA expression and activity of 1OHase which in turn up-regulate ERs expression and activity. These finding may contribute to F’s beneficial role in treatment of post-menopausal bone loss even in vitamin D deficiency.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3abone resorption 3acreatine kinase 3adaidzein 3afemales 3agene expression 3ahumans 3amales 3aosteoblasts 3apostmenopause 3athymidine 0ahuman osteoblasts 0afemarelle 0aCK 0aphytoestrogens 0aJKF 0aER 0aVDR1 aKatzburg, S.1 aSharon, O.1 aKnoll, E.1 aHendel, D.1 aPosner, G.H.1 aWinder, Steve0 tCogent biology.g2017 Jan. 1, v. 3, no. 1 p.1374919-dCogentwJournal:27203x2331-20257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/23312025.2017.13749193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02214naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245013700157300002000294500001900314520099000333592002801323650001701351650002101368650001701389650002301406650001401429650001701443650001901460650001201479700002201491700001901513700001701532700002401549700002001573700001601593773012401609856007401733852000901807655001201816IND60739474920221123044236.0210529e20210525xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073947492DNAL7 a10.1039/d1ra01040a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUeya, Yuichi10aDesigning highly emissive over-1000 nm near-infrared fluorescent dye-loaded polystyrene-based nanoparticles for in vivo deep imaging  ap. 18930-18937.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPolystyrene-based nanoparticles (PSt NPs) prepared by emulsion polymerization are promising organic matrices for encapsulating over-thousand-nanometer near-infrared (OTN-NIR) fluorescent dyes, such as thiopyrilium IR-1061, for OTN-NIR dynamic live imaging. Herein, we propose an effective approach to obtain highly emissive OTN-NIR fluorescent PSt NPs (OTN-PSt NPs) in which the polarity of the PSt NPs was adjusted by changing the monomer ratio (styrene to acrylic acid) in the PSt NPs and the dimethyl sulfoxide concentration in the IR-1061 loading process. Moreover, OTN-PSt NPs covalently modified with poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) (OTN-PSt-PEG NPs) showed high dispersion stability under physiological conditions and minimal cytotoxicity. Notably, the optimized OTN-PSt-PEG NPs were effective in the dynamic live imaging of mice. This methodology is expected to facilitate the design of certain polar thiopyrilium dye-loaded OTN-NIR fluorescent imaging probes with high emissivity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacrylic acid 3achemical bonding 3acytotoxicity 3adimethyl sulfoxide 3aemulsions 3afluorescence 3apolymerization 3astyrene1 aUmezawa, Masakazu1 aTakamoto, Eiji1 aYoshida, Moe1 aKobayashi, Hisanori1 aKamimura, Masao1 aSoga, Kohei0 tRSC advances.g2021 May 25, v. 11, no. 31 p.18930-18937dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1ra01040a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03061naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100002800169245017200197300001800369500001500387520104600402592002801448650001601476650001401492650000801506650001901514650001001533650001701543650002101560650001301581650001001594650001701604650002501621650001201646650002801658650002501686650001801711650002201729650001501751650006701766650000901833650001401842650006101856650002701917650003001944651001101974651001301985651001301998651001102011653001402022700002702036700002502063700002302088700002602111700002002137700002302157700001702180773010902197856008402306852000902390655001202399IND60099502020221122233453.0141105e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009950202DNAL7 a226342782pmid7 a10.1016/j.meegid.2012.04.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGómez-Palacio, Andrés10aMorphometric and molecular evidence of intraspecific biogeographical differentiation of Rhodnius pallescens (HEMIPTERA: REDUVIIDAE: RHODNIINI) from Colombia and Panama  ap. 1975-1983.  a2019-12-06  aRhodnius pallescens is considered the main vector of Chagas disease in Panama and a relevant secondary vector in northern Colombia. Previous data reported that this species presents cytogenetically heterogeneous populations, which are probably biogeographically segregated. To provide new information on the diversity of R. pallescens, we compared several populations from Colombia and Panama based on the morphometric analyses of wings, mitochondrial cytochrome b (cyt b) gene sequencing, and genomic DNA measurements. Although no differences in DNA amount were detected, significant differences in cyt b sequences as well as wing size and shape were identified among populations. The results obtained in this work indicate R. pallescens comprises two evolutionary lineages with genetic and morphological differences that could be explained by their geographic isolation in distinct ecological zones. These results provide new insight into R. pallescens population diversity and the underlying biological processes that shape its evolution.  aPublisher supplied data 3amorphometry 3aevolution 3aDNA 3aChagas disease 3agenes 3acytochrome b 3aecological zones 3aRhodnius 3awings 3abiogeography 2aAnalysis of Variance 2aAnimals 2aCytochromes bxgenetics 2aEvolution, Molecular 2aGenes, Insect 2aGenetic Variation 2aHaplotypes 2aInsect Vectorsxanatomy & histologyxclassificationxgenetics. 2aMale 2aPhylogeny 2aRhodniusxanatomy & histologyxclassificationxgenetics. 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aWingxanatomy & histology 3aPanama 3aColombia 0aColombia 0aPanama 0aHemiptera1 aJaramillo-O., Nicolás1 aCaro-Riaño, Harling1 aDíaz, Sebastián,1 aMonteiro, Fernando A.1 aPérez, Rubén,1 aPanzera, Francisco1 aTriana, Omar0 tInfection, genetics, and evolution.g2012 Dec., v. 12, no. 8 p.1975-1983dElsevier B.V.x1567-13487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2012.04.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02080naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005000092040001800142100002000160245011100180300001600291500000900307520101900316592002801335650002201363650001901385650002401404650001801428650002201446650002501468650002001493650001301513773012201526852000901648856009701657655001201754IND9205138820221120062800.0191122e199203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920513882DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1992.00021962008400020024x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLoussaert, Dale10aMicrocomputer-Based Experiment Management System: I.

Material and methods: Four groups of 16 male Wistar rats: G0 (control group anesthetized with isoflurane and mechanical ventilation), G1 (like G0, but with buprenorphine), G2 (like G1 with HS), and G3 (like G2 with etomidate 1 mg/kg, IV, before HS). HS induced by collecting 30% of blood volume. Resuscitation performed 90 min later with the collected blood and normal saline. Hemodynamic parameters, blood gas analysis, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), corticosterone (CS), and TNF-α, IL6, IL10 were determined at 0, 90, 150, and 240 min post-HS induction (at the corresponding time points in G0 and G1). Apoptosis and necrosis were determined by TUNEL and caspase-3 immunofluorescence and a necrosis score, respectively. Results: HS groups had significantly higher levels of apoptosis and necrosis than G1 and G0. Compared with G2, etomidate-treated animals had significantly lower levels of CS (compatible with CIRCI), PO₂, PO₂/FiO₂, BE, HCO₃, apoptosis, and necrosis and significantly higher cytokine levels. Conclusions: Etomidate was associated with CIRCI. HS was associated with adrenal gland apoptosis and necrosis. The latter were decreased by etomidate, possibly by both direct and indirect mechanisms.  aFunding.

An empirical model 'was developed to simulate both average annual air temperatures and average diurnal oscillations of air temperature, at any location within the USA east of the Rocky Mountains and with elevation below 1500 m above sea level. The target region was divided into four zones according to average annual rainfall and proximity to the Atlantic Ocean. Annual oscillations of the daily mean, maximum, and minimum temperatures for a given location were simulated with single sine-wave equations. The average and amplitude parameters of these equations are calculated from estimates of the monthly maximum and minimum temperature normals of January and July. These four temperature normals were estimated using regression equations on latitude. Different sets of equations were used for each location zone. Diurnal oscillations of temperature on a given day at the given location were simulated by joining two sine waves to give a single smooth asymmetrical wave. The average and amplitude parameters of these diurnal oscillations were obtained from the annual curves previously simulated. The accuracy of the model in simulating annual oscillations of daily maximum and minimum temperatures was tested. Simulated and observed average monthly temperatures recorded at 27 weather stations correlated with r = 0.993 (significant at Ρ = 0.01). Plots of residuals against months showed that the model underestimated the monthly temperatures around the vernal equinox (average residuals ranged from − 1.76 to − 2.66°C). The accuracy of the model in simulating diurnal oscillation was also tested. Simulated and observed temperatures at 3-h intervals for 18 cloudless days and 18 overcast days correlated with r = 0.992 (significant at Ρ = 0.01). Plots of residuals against time showed that the model underestimated the temperature during the warming phase in clear-sky days (average residuals were about −3°C.

When the molar ratio of acid to pyridyl groups in S–P–S, i.e., the acid doping level (ADL), is below unity, the P-block/acid phase in the PEMs exhibited a moderately high glass transition temperature (Tg) of ∼140 °C because of consumption of acids for forming the acid–base complexes between the pyridyl groups and the acids, also resulting in almost no free protons in the PEMs; therefore, the PEMs were totally glassy and exhibited almost no anhydrous conductivity. In contrast, when ADL is larger than unity, the Tgs of the phase composed of acid and P blocks were lower than room temperature, due to the excessive molar amount of acid serving as a plasticizer. Such swollen PEMs with excessive amounts of acid releasing free protons were soft and exhibited high conductivities even without humidification. In particular, an S–P–S/Sa membrane with ADL of 4.6 exhibited a very high anhydrous conductivity of 1.4 × 10⁻¹ S cm⁻¹ at 95 °C, which is comparable to that of humidified Nafion membranes. Furthermore, S–P–S/Sa membranes with lower Tgs exhibited higher conductivities than S–P–S/Pa membranes, whereas the temperature dependence of the conductivities for S–P–S/Pa is stronger than that for S–P–S/Sa, suggesting Pa with a lower acidity would not be effectively dissociated into a dihydrogen phosphate anion and a free proton in the PEMs at lower temperatures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidity 3aambient temperature 3acomposite polymers 3aelectrolytes 3aglass transition temperature 3ahumidification 3aphosphates 3aphosphoric acid 3aplasticizers 3asulfuric acid1 aNoro, Atsushi1 aSeki, Takahiro1 aMatsushita, Yushu1 aNakamura, Naoki0 tRSC advances.g2021 May 26, v. 11, no. 31 p.19012-19020dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1ra01211h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02765naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245010700169520145100276592002801727650002101755650001801776650002001794650001201814650002001826650001801846650001901864650000901883650001801892650001601910650002001926653001801946653002001964653001201984653002701996700005502023700001802078700002002096700001802116773010202134856008602236852000902322655001202331IND60788671820221116224410.0220921e202301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078867182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodhyd.2022.1080502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Fu-Zhen10aPickering water in oil emulsions prepared from biocompatible gliadin/ethyl cellulose complex particles  aWater-in-oil (W/O) emulsions have gained interest in many fields, including food, healthcare, pharmaceutical, and agriculture. However, research on Pickering W/O emulsions is limited due to the lack of available stabilizers. This study aimed to demonstrate the development of edible Pickering W/O emulsions using biocompatible and biodegradable gliadin/ethyl cellulose complex particles (GECPs) with neutral hydrophobicity as the stabilizer. The characterizations of GECPs indicated that the particle size, contact angle, and dynamic interfacial tension could be adjusted by varying the gliadin-to-ethyl cellulose (EC) ratio. The investigations of emulsions revealed that the most stable emulsions were obtained when the gliadin-to-EC ratio was 2:1. Moreover, stable emulsions could be prepared at particle concentrations higher than 1.5%. The phase inversion of emulsions from W/O to O/W occurred at 55 wt% water. Confocal laser scanning microscopy and the theoretical calculations confirmed that GECPs formed multiple interfacial layers and acted as physical barriers against coalescence, thereby contributing to the stability of emulsions for at least 433 days; no reverse inversion occurred after 2.3 years of storage. This study provided a new approach to prepare stable Pickering W/O emulsions from GECPs. This strategy might open interesting avenues in solving the dilemma where Pickering stabilization using edible particles is required.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodegradability 3acontact angle 3aethyl cellulose 3agliadin 3ahealth services 3ahydrocolloids 3ahydrophobicity 3aoils 3aparticle size 3astabilizers 3asurface tension 0aBiocompatible 0aEthyl cellulose 0aGliadin 0aW/O pickering emulsion1 aYu, Xin-Hao1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8442-342X1 aLuo, Dong-Hui1 aYang, Xiao-Quan1 aYin, Shou-Wei0 tFood hydrocolloids.g2023 Jan., v. 134 p.108050-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46643x0268-005X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodhyd.2022.1080503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02276naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006300150245008200213520116500295592002801460650001701488650001601505650001101521650001201532650001101544650002901555653002401584653001301608653002001621653002801641700001501669700005801684773009001742856008501832852000901917655001201926IND60755279520221117172252.0220426e20220115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075527952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2021.1224452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKühnbach, Matthias1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8392-862910aTowards improved prosumer participation: Electricity trading in local markets  aLocal energy markets are a promising way to involve prosumers in the electricity system and activate demand-side flexibility. In this paper, we develop a modeling framework consisting of an optimization for prosumer home energy management systems embedded in a local energy market simulation. To enable an integrated assessment, the local market is linked to a central spot market. For each prosumer, we consider the individual flexibility potential, home storage systems, and demand response of electric vehicles. Using this model, we analyze the costs and benefits of a local market for prosumers in an energy system with a high share of renewable energy. We compare the systemic effects and the potential economic benefits of this local market for prosumers to pure self-consumption and prosumer participation in a central spot market. Applying our model to a case study of 480 prosumers, we show that a system including a local market is beneficial compared to self-consumption from a systemic perspective. However, allowing prosumers to participate directly in a central spot market is more profitable and facilitates the system integration of renewables.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3aelectricity 3aenergy 3amarkets 3amodels 3arenewable energy sources 0aLocal energy market 0aProsumer 0aDemand response 0aDemand-side flexibility1 aBekk, Anke1 aWeidlich, Anke1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2361-09120 tEnergy.g2022 Jan. 15, v. 239 p.122445-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2021.1224453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04228naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002900151245011700180500001900297520255600316592002802872650002602900650000902926650001602935650002702951650003802978650000903016650001703025650001603042650004803058650001403106650001403120650003303134650000903167650001603176650001503192651001903207653002603226653000903252653001203261653001203273700003503285700002503320700002103345700003303366700001703399700002503416700002303441700001803464773009703482856008603579852000903665655001203674IND60691280820221121010925.0210203e20170101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069128082DNAL7 a10.1080/23312025.2017.14122802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKanagarajah, Rajwin Raja10aAntibiotic profiling of Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolates in stray canines and felines  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aBackground: Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is an important Gram positive pathogen that has raised concerns due to its increasing prevalence despite pharmaceutical and technological advances. It does not only cause infections in humans but it can also be zoonotic in nature. The aim of this study is to investigate the prevalence of MRSA from presumably healthy shelter animals, in particular, canines and felines. Methods: Fifty-two faecal samples from canines and felines were collected from an animal shelter for the isolation of MRSA. This was carried out using the ChromMRSA (Oxoid, United Kingdom) media, followed by antibiotic susceptibility testing using the Kirby–Bauer disk diffusion test in accordance to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) for ceftazidime, enrofloxacin, methicillin, oxacillin and vancomycin. Principal component analysis (PCA) was then employed to identify the variables in antibiotic sensitivity and emphasise any patterns between isolates and the antibiotic profile from both animal samples types. This was then summarised using descriptive statistics. Results: 283 and 169 S.aureus isolates were obtained respectively from the canine and feline samples on selective media. Of this, 33/283 (11.66%) and 13/169 (7.70%) were MRSA when grown on ChromMRSA. Canine MRSA isolates exhibited resistance in decreasing order of methicillin (100%), ceftazidime (81.82%), enrofloxacin (78.79%), oxacillin (60.61%) and vancomycin (0%). On the same note feline MRSA isolates indicated resistance to methicillin (100%), ceftazidime (100%), enrofloxacin (92.31%), oxacillin (84.62%) and vancomycin (0%). 51.51% of the canine and 84.62% of feline MRSA isolates indicated resistance to four out of five antibiotics tested. PCA of antibiotic resistance profiles revealed that canine and feline formed distinct groups. However, one of the feline MRSA isolates resembled more of the canine group; although likelihood of cross-transmission between the animals may be low due to separate enclosures for the canines and felines: cross-transmission may have occurred when animals are brought into the main building for vaccination, neutering and consulting procedures. Conclusion: The majority of MRSA isolates obtained were not only resistant to methicillin alone but to other antibiotics too. Vancomycin proved to be the only effective antibiotic. This will pose a greater risk of resistance developing in empirical antibiotics in the future if proper antibiotic stewardship practices are not in place.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibiotic resistance 3acats 3aceftazidime 3adescriptive statistics 3adisk diffusion antimicrobial test 3adogs 3aenrofloxacin 3amethicillin 3amethicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus 3aoxacillin 3apathogens 3aprincipal component analysis 3arisk 3avaccination 3avancomycin 3aUnited Kingdom 0aStaphylococcus aureus 0aMRSA 0acanines 0afelines1 aLee, David Charles Weerasingam1 aLee, Daniel Zhi Fung1 aYusoff, Khatijah1 aParamasivam, Sharmini Julita1 aLow, Wai Yee1 aJeevaratnam, Kamalan1 aLim, Swee Hua Erin1 aAkhter, Yusuf0 tCogent biology.g2017 Jan. 1, v. 3, no. 1 p.1412280-dCogentwJournal:27203x2331-20257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/23312025.2017.14122803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02502naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100001800142245011000160300001600270520122200286592002801508650001601536650002501552650001301577650001001590650000901600650002901609650001101638650001901649650001201668650002401680650001501704650002801719650002101747650001401768650003901782650002201821650001501843700001801858700001601876773011001892856004502002852000902047655001202056IND4520848520221117105153.0151109e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND452084852DNAL7 a10.1002/jobm.2011002492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShuxian, Wang10aSusceptibility of a Vibrio alginolyticus rpoS mutant to environmental stresses and its expression of OMPs  ap. 467-476.  aVibrio alginolyticus, one of the most important opportunistic pathogens, can be detected in human being and marine animals. Like other bacteria, V. alginolyticus is able to adapt to a variety of stressful environmental changes. The alternate sigma factor RpoS, which is a regulator during stationary phase, plays an important role in surviving under these stressful situations in many bacteria. Sequence analysis reveals a 990 bp open reading frame which is predicted to encode a 330âaminoâacid protein with 68% to 96% overall identity to other reported sequences. To study the function of rpoS, the rpoS gene of V. alginolyticus VIB283 was cloned and an rpoS mutant was constructed by homologous recombination. Comparison of the study result of the wild type and the mutant showed that the mutant was more sensitive to stress conditions such as high osmolarity, oxidative stress, heat shock, and longâterm starvation and that the LD50 of the mutant strain to the zebra fish was about 2.8 times as that of the control strain. In addition, the SDSâPAGE analysis indicated that the outer membrane proteins (OMPs) existed great differences. (Â© 2012 WILEYâVCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Upon reaction with Pb2+, the substrate strand is cleaved, releasing an invasion fragment, which is then hybridized with the complementary DNA strand immobilized on magnetic beads, while dissociating of the original hybridized signal probes. The signal probes, consisting of a streptavidin moiety and a Cy5.5 labeled DNA moiety, act simultaneously as signal conversion, signal recognition and signal report elements. Detection of the signal probes is accomplished by first adsorbing to the desthiobiotin-modified optical fiber, followed by fluorescence emission induced by an evanescent field. A linear calibration was obtained from 20nM to 800nM with a detection limit of 1nM. The optical fiber system is robust enough for 250 sensing cycles and can be stored at room temperature over one month. These results demonstrate that application of DNA–streptavidin conjugates has been extended to DNAzyme-based biosensors, maintaining activity, specificity, regeneration and long-term storage ability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3abiosensors 3acomplementary DNA 3adetection limit 3afluorescence 3alead 3astorage 3astreptavidin 0aDNA–protein conjugates 0aDNAzymes 0aEvanescent wave 0aOptical fiber biosensor 0aFluorescence1 aZhou, Xiaohong1 aShi, Hanchang0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2015 Dec. 15, v. 74 p.78-84dElsevier B.V.x0956-56637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2015.06.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04317naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002500139245009400164300001800258500001900276500002000295520287500315592002803190596004003218596003803258650001303296650001103309650001503320650001903335650001003354650002503364650001203389650002703401650001403428650001603442650001203458650002903470650001903499650001403518650002003532700001803552700006003570773013503630856007303765852000903838655001203847IND60706921920221119122800.0200810e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070692192DNAL7 a10.1111/jeb.136352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbdi, Mohamed Khadar10aCo‐foundress confinement elicits kinship effects in a naturally sub‐social parasitoid  ap. 1068-1085.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aKinship among interacting individuals is often associated with sociality and also with sex ratio effects. Parasitoids in the bethylid genus Goniozus are sub‐social, with single foundress females exhibiting post‐ovipositional maternal care via short‐term aggressive host and brood defence against conspecific females. Due to local mate competition (LMC) and broods normally being produced by a single foundress, sex ratios are female‐biased. Contests between adult females are, however, not normally fatal, and aggression is reduced when competing females are kin, raising the possibility of multi‐foundress reproduction on some hosts. Here, we screen for further life‐history effects of kinship by varying the numbers and relatedness of foundresses confined together with a host resource and also by varying the size of host. We confined groups of 1–8 Goniozus nephantidis females together with a host for 5+ days. Multi‐foundress groups were either all siblings or all nonsiblings. Our chief expectations included that competition for resources would be more intense among larger foundress groups but diminished by both larger host size and closer foundress relatedness, affecting both foundress mortality and reproductive output. From classical LMC theory, we expected that offspring group sex ratios would be less female‐biased when there were more foundresses, and from extended LMC theory, we expected that sex ratios would be more female‐biased when foundresses were close kin. We found that confinement led to the death of some females (11% overall) but only when host resources were most limiting. Mortality of foundresses was less common when foundresses were siblings. Developmental mortality among offspring was considerably higher in multi‐foundress clutches but was unaffected by foundress relatedness. Groups of sibling foundresses collectively produced similar numbers of offspring to nonsibling groups. There was little advantage for individual females to reproduce in multi‐foundress groups: single foundresses suppressed even the largest hosts presented and had the highest per capita production of adult offspring. Despite single foundress reproduction being the norm, G. nephantidis females in multi‐foundress groups appear to attune sex allocation according to both foundress number and foundress relatedness: broods produced by sibling foundresses had sex ratios similar to broods produced by single foundresses (ca. 11% males), whereas the sex ratios of broods produced by nonsibling females were approximately 20% higher and broadly increased with foundress number. We conclude that relatedness and host size may combine to reduce selection against communal reproduction on hosts and that, unlike other studied parasitoids, G. nephantidis sex ratios conform to predictions of both classical and extended LMC theories.  aPublisher supplied data  a600031484cIslamic Development Bank  cUniversità degli Studi di Milano 3aGoniozus 3aadults 3aaggression 3aconspecificity 3adeath 3aevolutionary biology 3akinship 3amating competitiveness 3amortality 3aparasitoids 3aprogeny 3areproductive performance 3asex allocation 3asex ratio 3asocial behavior1 aLupi, Daniela1 aHardy, Ian C.

We compared the relative effects of season, annual weather, site, and disturbance on potential cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum L.) germination in big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata Nutt.) communities. Soil water status and temperature in the seedbed were measured continuously for 4 years on 9 big sagebrush sites in Nevada and Utah. Field plots at lower-, middle-, and upper-elevation sites were either undisturbed, or were burned, sprayed with herbicide, or both sprayed and burned. Spraying removed perennial herbaceous vegetation, whereas burning removed sagebrush. We used thermal-germination data from laboratory incubation studies of 18 cheatgrass seedlots and field soil moisture and temperature measurements to model and predict potential germination in the field plots for periods when seedbeds were continuously wet (above −−0.5, −−1, or −−1.5 MPa) and across intermittent wet and dry periods. Season had the greatest effect on potential cheatgrass germination, followed by annual weather, and site variables (elevation and location); the effects of disturbance were minimal. Potential germination was predicted for most sites and years in spring, a majority of sites and years in fall, and few sites or years in winter. Even though disturbance has limited effects on potential germination, it can increase cheatgrass invasion and dominance by reducing perennial herbaceous species resource use and allowing increased cheatgrass growth and reproduction.  aPublisher supplied data 3asoil temperature 3aseasonal variation 3aaltitude 3aestimation 3aweed control 3agrass weeds 3ainvasive species 3aprescribed burning 3aecological invasion 3anoxious weeds 3astatistical models 3ashrublands 3asoil water content 3aseedbeds 3aintroduced species 3asoil water potential 3aspraying 3aprediction 3aseed germination 3aplant available water 3ashrubs 3aBromus tectorum 3aplant communities 3aherbicides 3aArtemisia tridentata 3aindigenous species 3aheat sums 3aUtah 3aNevada 0aheat accumulation 0ameteorological parameters 0aGreat Basin 0athermal-germination models 0aweather 0agermination 0asoil water 0afire 0adisturbance 0aweed invasion 0abig sagebrush1 aHardegree, Stuart P.1 aChambers, Jeanne C.1 aWhittaker, Alison0 tRangeland ecology & management.g2007 Nov., v. 60, no. 6 p.613-623dSociety for Range Managementx1551-50287nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/151943Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2111%2F05-206R3.13Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/FSUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02696naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245008800159300002000247500001900267520127000286592002801556650002301584650002301607650001201630650001201642650001401654650002001668650002501688650001801713650001301731650001301744650001801757650001101775650001901786650002901805650001101834650001301845650001001858650001601868651001301884700002401897700001801921700002201939700002201961773012401983856007402107852000902181655001202190IND60739475420221123044300.0210529e20210526xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073947542DNAL7 a10.1039/d1ra01328a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMuazzam, Rabia10aEvaluating the potential of a novel hardwood biomass using a superbase ionic liquid  ap. 19095-19105.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aLignocellulosic biomass, being ubiquitous and easily accessible, bears a huge potential for sustainable energy and other products. Fractionation, delignification, and subsequent utilization of hardwood biomass has been ever challenging for a bio-based refinery. Acacia nilotica (kikar in local language) is a hardwood tree commonly found in Pakistan, where its abundance owes to favorable and benign environmental conditions. Ionic liquids based on superbase “tetramethylguanidine (TMG)” are green solvents that are found to be good cellulose processing agents. Previously, TMG-based protic ionic liquids (PILs) have been used for cellulose processing and transformation into value-added products. In this study, an ionic liquid comprising a tetramethylguanidinium cation and a hydrogen sulfate anion was employed for the evaluation of the potential of acacia for fermentable sugars and lignin. Pretreatment was carried out at 100, 120, and 140 °C for 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 hours. The results indicate that [TMG][HSO₄] is an efficient delignifying agent affording 81% lignin removal and 76% sugar yield by subsequent enzymatic hydrolysis. The evaluation of the efficiency of IL and the biomass was verified by compositional analysis, FT-IR, HSQC, and SEM analyses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcacia leucophloea 3aVachellia nilotica 3abiomass 3acations 3acellulose 3adelignification 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3afractionation 3ahardwood 3ahydrogen 3aionic liquids 3alignin 3alignocellulose 3arenewable energy sources 3asugars 3asulfates 3atrees 3avalue added 3aPakistan1 aAsim, Azmat Mehmood1 aUroos, Maliha1 aMuhammad, Nawshad1 aHallett, Jason P.0 tRSC advances.g2021 May 26, v. 11, no. 31 p.19095-19105dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1ra01328a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03008naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245016100169300001600330520140900346592002801755650001101783650001301794650001701807650001901824650002901843650002101872650001501893650001201908650002301920650002301943650002201966650002401988650001802012650001202030650001302042650001902055650000902074650001502083650001902098650001802117653001702135653001702152653003502169653002802204653001902232653002502251700002002276773007502296856008602371852000902457655001202466IND60539356020221117224529.0160815e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053935602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.geoderma.2013.08.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDas, Suvendu10aEffect of combine application of organic manure and inorganic fertilizer on methane and nitrous oxide emissions from a tropical flooded soil planted to rice  ap. 185-192.  aMethane and nitrous oxide emissions, their global warming potential, carbon efficiency ratio and related biogeochemical properties of a tropical soil planted to rice were investigated under different N management [i.e. urea-N (120kgN ha−1), rice straw (RS) (30kgN ha−1)+urea-N (90kgN ha−1), compost (C) (30kgN ha−1)+urea-N (90kgN ha−1) and poultry manure (PM) (30kgN ha−1)+urea-N (90kgN ha−1)]. CH4 fluxes were increased by 82.7%, 65.1%, 63.4% and 31.9% in RS+urea-N, C+urea-N, PM+urea-N and urea-N, respectively whereas percentage increase in cumulative N2O emission was 390.6, 371.8, 315.6, and 253.1 in PM+urea-N, urea-N, C+urea-N and RS+urea-N, respectively over control (no fertilizer amendment). However, increase of GWPs in different manure+urea-N over that of control were 85.5%, 69.2%, 68.8% and 37.6% in RS+urea-N, C+urea-N, PM+urea-N and urea-N, respectively. Microbial biomass carbon (MBC), readily mineralizable carbon (RMC) and fluorescence diacetate (FDA) hydrolysis activity were significantly affected by integrated N-management and followed the order of C+urea-N>PM+urea-N>RS+urea-N>urea-N>control. With considerably high microbial biomass C and microbial activity, high C efficiency ratio, high yield and low greenhouse gas intensity, C+urea-N could be a better option to mitigate CH4 and N2O emissions and to maintain soil biological quality and yield in tropical paddy.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acomposts 3afluorescence 3aglobal warming 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agreenhouse gases 3ahydrolysis 3amethane 3amethane production 3amicrobial activity 3amicrobial biomass 3amineral fertilizers 3anitrous oxide 3apaddies 3aplanting 3apoultry manure 3arice 3arice straw 3atropical soils 3aurea nitrogen 0aCH4 emission 0aN2O emission 0aGlobal warming potential (GWP) 0aCarbon efficiency ratio 0aOrganic manure 0aInorganic fertilizer1 aAdhya, Tapan K.0 tGeoderma.g2014 Jan., v. 213 p.185-192dElsevier B.V.x0016-70617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2013.08.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02914naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245009000168500001900258520099300277536028101270592002801551596009801579596007301677596009701750650002301847650000801870650001601878650001601894650001801910650001101928650001301939650002201952650002101974650002601995653001002021653000902031653000902040653001902049653001802068700001202086700001602098700001202114700001802126700001102144700002002155700001702175773009702192856008602289852000902375655001202384IND60691281020221121011116.0210203e20180101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069128102DNAL7 a10.1080/23312025.2018.14262552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Hong-Bo10aUsing pgRNA–Cas9 system to knockout MKL1 inhibited cell migration and proliferation  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAs a transcription factor, megakaryoblastic leukemia 1 (MKL1) binds with serum response factor (SRF) to regulate targeted genes expression. Therefore, it involved in various cellular processes, such as cancer cells migration, proliferation and differentiation. However, the report about knockout MKL1 expression using CRISPR–Cas9 system in human genome is rare. Therefore, paired-guide RNA (pgRNA) library was constructed, and pgRNA–Cas9 system was used to delete MKL1 expression in HeLa cells. The result showed that the expression of MKL1 was decreased 95% by Western blotting. And wound healing assay and MTT assay indicated that depletion MKL1 inhibited cell migration and proliferation. Additionally, the protein expression levels of tumor suppressor factors p21, p53, pRB and DLC1 were changed after depletion MKL1. These data suggested that tumor suppressor factors p21, p53, pRB and DLC1 maybe played an important role in the cell growth and migration of MKL1-depletion cells.  aThis work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China: [Grant Number 31500622], the program of Wuhan University of Science and Technology: [Grant Number 25011401] and the Science and Technology Research Project of Hubei Province: [Grant Number B2016004].  aPublisher supplied data  a31500622cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  aB2016004cScience and Technology Research Project of Hubei Province:  a25011401]cWuhan University of Science and Technologydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100008860 3aCRISPR-Cas systems 3aRNA 3ablood serum 3acell growth 3acell movement 3ahumans 3aleukemia 3aprotein synthesis 3atoxicity testing 3atranscription factors 0apgRNA 0aCas9 0aMKL1 0acell migration 0aproliferation1 aYin, Ze1 aZheng, Peng1 aXu, Yao1 aWang, Zhen-Yu1 aLi, Xi1 aZhang, Tong-Cun1 aLim, Junxian0 tCogent biology.g2018 Jan. 1, v. 4, no. 1 p.1426255-dCogentwJournal:27203x2331-20257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/23312025.2018.14262553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03272naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005700139245010900196300001800305500001900323500002000342520163000362592002801992596006102020596006402081596004902145650001502194650001002209650001902219650002502238650001202263650002702275650001402302650004102316650002302357650001002380650002502390650002502415700002002440700002002460700002002480700001902500700002102519700002102540773013502561856007302696852000902769655001202778IND60706922020221119122700.0200810e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070692202DNAL7 a10.1111/jeb.136572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJoffard, Nina1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3712-608010aFloral trait differentiation in Anacamptis coriophora: Phenotypic selection on scents, but not on colour  ap. 1028-1038.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aCurrent divergent selection may promote floral trait differentiation among conspecific populations in flowering plants. However, whether this applies to complex traits such as colour or scents has been little studied, even though these traits often vary within species. In this study, we compared floral colour and odour as well as selective pressures imposed upon these traits among seven populations belonging to three subspecies of the widespread, generalist orchid Anacamptis coriophora. Colour was characterized using calibrated photographs, and scents were sampled using dynamic headspace extraction and analysed using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry. We then quantified phenotypic selection exerted on these traits by regressing fruit set values on floral trait values. We showed that the three studied subspecies were characterized by different floral colour and odour, with one of the two predominant floral volatiles emitted by each subspecies being taxon‐specific. Plant size was positively correlated with fruit set in most populations, whereas we found no apparent link between floral colour and female reproductive success. We detected positive selection on several taxon‐specific compounds in A. coriophora subsp. fragrans, whereas no selection was found on floral volatiles of A. coriophora subsp. coriophora and A. coriophora subsp. martrinii. This study is one of the first to document variation in phenotypic selection exerted on floral scents among conspecific populations. Our results suggest that selection could contribute to ongoing chemical divergence among A. coriophora subspecies.  aPublisher supplied data  aANR‐14‐CE02‐0012cAgence Nationale de la Recherche  cHautes Ecoles Sorbonne Arts et Métiers (HESAM) Université  cCentre National de la Recherche Scientifique 3aAnacamptis 3acolor 3aconspecificity 3aevolutionary biology 3afemales 3afloral characteristics 3afruit set 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3aheadspace analysis 3aodors 3aphenotypic selection 3areproductive success1 aLe Roncé, Iris1 aLanglois, Alban1 aRenoult, Julien1 aBuatois, Bruno1 aDormont, Laurent1 aSchatz, Bertrand0 tJournal of evolutionary biology.g2020 Aug., v. 33, no. 8 p.1028-1038dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3867076x1010-061X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jeb.136573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02534naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092024002200121024001900143040001800162100001900180245010900199300001800308506007600326520124400402592002801646506003701674650002101711650001801732650001301750650002401763650002001787650001001807650002801817650000901845650001201854650001401866650001801880700001901898700002201917773012201939856004202061852000902103655001202112IND4501640520221207080304.0150427e20120415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND450164052DNAL7 a10.1128/JB.06652-112doi7 aPMC33184672pmcid7 a223286782pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTamura, Masaru10aSecond-Site Suppression of RNase E Essentiality by Mutation of the deaD RNA Helicase in Escherichia coli  ap. 1919-1926.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aEscherichia coli cells normally require RNase E activity to propagate and form colonies. Using random Tn10 insertion mutagenesis, we screened for second-site suppressor mutations that restore colony-forming ability (CFA) to E. coli cells lacking RNase E function and found mutations in three separate chromosomal loci that had this phenotype. Restoration of CFA by mutations in two of the genes identified was observed only in nutrient-poor medium, whereas the effects of mutation of the ATP-dependent RNA helicase DeaD were medium independent. Suppression of the rne mutant phenotype by inactivation of deaD was partial, as rne deaD doubly mutant bacteria had a greatly prolonged generation time and grew as filamentous chains in liquid medium. Moreover, we found that CFA restoration by deaD inactivation requires normal expression of the endogenous rng gene in doubly mutant rne deaD cells. Second-site suppression by deaD mutation was attributable specifically to ablation of the helicase activity of DeaD and was reversed by adventitious expression of RhlE or RNase R, both of which can unwind double-stranded RNA. Our results suggest a previously unsuspected role for RNA secondary structure as a determinant of RNase E essentiality.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEscherichia coli 3aRNA helicases 3abacteria 3adouble-stranded RNA 3aenzyme activity 3agenes 3ainsertional mutagenesis 3aloci 3amutants 3aphenotype 3aribonucleases1 aKers, Johan A.1 aCohen, Stanley N.0 tJournal of bacteriology.g2012 Apr. 15, v. 194, no. 8 p.1919-1926dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0021-91937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/JB.06652-11  aDNAL 7aarticle02587naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002600155245008400181520129200265592002801557650002001585650002001605650001501625650001501640650002301655650001101678650001401689650001901703650002101722650001301743650001501756650000901771650002001780653001901800653002101819653000801840653001501848653001501863700002101878700001801899700002201917773009101939856009002030852000902120655001202129IND60688322720221121015929.0200628e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068832272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.1267122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKopinke, Frank-Dieter10aInteraction of zero-valent iron and carbonaceous materials for reduction of DDT  aDechlorination of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) as a model compound was performed with zero-valent iron (micro-ZVI and nano-ZVI) as reductant and carbonaceous adsorbents as sink and catalyst in water. DDT is rapidly converted to dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane (DDD) in direct contact with ZVI. However, up to 90% of the DDD is transformed into non-identified, most likely oligomeric products. There is no indication of dechlorination at the aromatic rings. DDT is still rapidly dechlorinated when it is adsorbed on carbonaceous adsorbents, even though ZVI particles have no direct access to the adsorbed DDT. The carbonaceous materials function as adsorbent and catalyst for the dechlorination reaction at once. From electrochemical experiments, we deduced that direct physical contact between ZVI particles and the adsorbent is essential for enabling a chemical reaction. Electron conduction alone does not effect any dechlorination reaction. We hypothesize hydrogen species (H∗) which spill from the ZVI surface to the carbon surface and initiate reductive transformations there. The role of carbonaceous adsorbents is different for different degradation pathways: in contrast to hydrodechlorination (reduction), adsorption protects DDT from dehydrochlorination (hydrolysis).  aPublisher supplied data 3aDDD (pesticide) 3aDDT (pesticide) 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aaromatic compounds 3acarbon 3acatalysts 3adechlorination 3aelectrochemistry 3ahydrogen 3ahydrolysis 3airon 3areducing agents 0aDechlorination 0aZero-valent iron 0aDDT 0aSpill over 0aHydrolysis1 aSühnholz, Sarah1 aGeorgi, Anett1 aMackenzie, Katrin0 tChemosphere.g2020 Aug., v. 253 p.126712-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.1267123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02499naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245012000168520131400288592002801602650002001630650001101650650002101661650002001682650001001702650001601712653002701728653003201755653001701787653000801804653001601812700001701828700005401845700001201899700001801911773009001929856008502019852000902104655001202113IND60755279820221121045608.0220426e20220115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075527982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2021.1224492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJia, Xiongjie10aShort-term forecasting for supercharged boiler safety performance based on advanced data-driven modelling framework  aThe safety of boilers is directly related to the operation of steam power plants. Consequently, accurate short-term forecasting model is needed for the robust control of important safety performance parameters. In this study, an advanced data-driven modelling framework based on neural networks is proposed to establish short-term forecasting (STF) models for three safety indicators of a supercharged boiler: main steam temperature (MST), drum pressure (DP) and drum level (DL). To overcome the challenges of external noise and non-stationarity, locally weighted regression (LWR) and differencing method are introduced to improve the model performance. Convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory network (LSTM) are proved as practical options for STF modelling, while CNN has a lower computational cost. The models show excellent performance on a real dataset containing multiple dynamic processes: the mean absolute percentage errors of the three targets are 0.0041%, 0.0355% and 0.0221% respectively and the forecasting horizon is future 60 timesteps. The sensitivity of STF models to outliers is analyzed. The results show that the models are not sensitive to eroded input. The proposed framework and methods can be a preferential solution to the forecasting modelling of power systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3aenergy 3amodel validation 3aneural networks 3asteam 3atemperature 0aShort-term forecasting 0aLocally weighted regression 0aDifferencing 0aCNN 0aSensitivity1 aSang, Yichen1 aLi, Yanjun1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6736-04391 aDu, Wei1 aZhang, Guolei0 tEnergy.g2022 Jan. 15, v. 239 p.122449-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2021.1224493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03859naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094040001800117100002500135245014400160300001500304520234500319592002802664650000802692650001502700650001302715650001302728650001802741650001302759650001502772650001502787650001302802650001202815650001102827650002102838650001102859650001202870650001602882700002302898700001502921700002602936700001802962700001502980700002102995773015203016856006903168856009603237990002303333852000903356655001203365IND60683931420221117181953.0200213e20200211xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068393142DNAL7 a10.3791/604032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArunachalam, Sankara10aRendering sio2/si surfaces omniphobic by carving gas-entrapping microtextures comprising reentrant and doubly reentrant cavities or pillars  ap. e60403.  aWe present microfabrication protocols for rendering intrinsically wetting materials repellent to liquids (omniphobic) by creating gas-entrapping microtextures (GEMs) on them comprising cavities and pillars with reentrant and doubly reentrant features. Specifically, we use SiO2/Si as the model system and share protocols for two-dimensional (2D) designing, photolithography, isotropic/anisotropic etching techniques, thermal oxide growth, piranha cleaning, and storage towards achieving those microtextures. Even though the conventional wisdom indicates that roughening intrinsically wetting surfaces (θo < 90°) renders them even more wetting (θr < θo < 90°), GEMs demonstrate liquid repellence despite the intrinsic wettability of the substrate. For instance, despite the intrinsic wettability of silica θo ≈ 40° for the water/air system, and θo ≈ 20° for the hexadecane/air system, GEMs comprising cavities entrap air robustly on immersion in those liquids, and the apparent contact angles for the droplets are θr > 90°. The reentrant and doubly reentrant features in the GEMs stabilize the intruding liquid meniscus thereby trapping the liquid-solid-vapor system in metastable air-filled states (Cassie states) and delaying wetting transitions to the thermodynamically-stable fully-filled state (Wenzel state) by, for instance, hours to months. Similarly, SiO2/Si surfaces with arrays of reentrant and doubly reentrant micropillars demonstrate extremely high contact angles (θr ≈ 150°–160°) and low contact angle hysteresis for the probe liquids, thus characterized as superomniphobic. However, on immersion in the same liquids, those surfaces dramatically lose their superomniphobicity and get fully-filled within <1 s. To address this challenge, we present protocols for hybrid designs that comprise arrays of doubly reentrant pillars surrounded by walls with doubly reentrant profiles. Indeed, hybrid microtextures entrap air on immersion in the probe liquids. To summarize, the protocols described here should enable the investigation of GEMs in the context of achieving omniphobicity without chemical coatings, such as perfluorocarbons, which might unlock the scope of inexpensive common materials for applications as omniphobic materials. Silica microtextures could also serve as templates for soft materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aanisotropy 3acleaning 3acoatings 3acontact angle 3adroplets 3ahexadecane 3ahysteresis 3aisotropy 3aliquids 3amodels 3aperfluorocarbons 3asilica 3asilicon 3awettability1 aDomingues, Eddy M.1 aDas, Ratul1 aNauruzbayeva, Jamilya1 aBüttner, U.,1 aSyed, Ahad1 aMishra, Himanshu0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2020 Feb. 11, , no. 156 p.e60403-e60403dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/604033Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/60403/rendering-sio2si-surfaces-omniphobic-carving-gas-entrapping  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03119naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100003000188245013400218300001300352506007600365520145700441592002801898506003701926650001501963650001201978650001501990650001402005650002002019650003102039650001002070650001802080650002602098700002302124700002402147700002002171700002102191700002102212700002102233700002102254700001802275700002102293700002002314700001702334700002102351700002102372773010602393856008102499852000902580655001202589IND60119542520221207060254.0141214e200612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011954252DNAL7 a10.1186/gb-2006-7-12-r1232doi7 aPMC17944362pmcid7 a171845462pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuengo Hendriks, Cris L.,10aThree-dimensional morphology and gene expression in the Drosophila blastoderm at cellular resolution I: data acquisition pipeline  ap. 1391.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: To model and thoroughly understand animal transcription networks, it is essential to derive accurate spatial and temporal descriptions of developing gene expression patterns with cellular resolution. RESULTS: Here we describe a suite of methods that provide the first quantitative three-dimensional description of gene expression and morphology at cellular resolution in whole embryos. A database containing information derived from 1,282 embryos is released that describes the mRNA expression of 22 genes at multiple time points in the Drosophila blastoderm. We demonstrate that our methods are sufficiently accurate to detect previously undescribed features of morphology and gene expression. The cellular blastoderm is shown to have an intricate morphology of nuclear density patterns and apical/basal displacements that correlate with later well-known morphological features. Pair rule gene expression stripes, generally considered to specify patterning only along the anterior/posterior body axis, are shown to have complex changes in stripe location, stripe curvature, and expression level along the dorsal/ventral axis. Pair rule genes are also found to not always maintain the same register to each other. CONCLUSION: The application of these quantitative methods to other developmental systems will likely reveal many other previously unknown features and provide a more rigorous understanding of developmental regulatory networks.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDrosophila 3aanimals 3ablastoderm 3adatabases 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3amessenger RNA 3aquantitative analysis1 aKeränen, Soile VE1 aFowlkes, Charless C1 aSimirenko, Lisa1 aWeber, Gunther H1 aDePace, Angela H1 aHenriquez, Clara1 aKaszuba, David W1 aHamann, Bernd1 aEisen, Michael B1 aMalik, Jitendra1 aSudar, Damir1 aBiggin, Mark D.,1 aKnowles, David W0 tGenome biology.g2006 Dec., v. 7, no. 12 p.1391-1391dSpringer-VerlagwJournal:19127x1474-760X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/gb-2006-7-12-r1233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02647naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094024002200136024001900158040001800177100002500195245014700220300001400367506007600381520100000457592002801457506003701485650002301522650002201545650002301567650001001590650002001600650001001620650003501630650001201665650002101677650001701698650003001715650002001745650002901765650001701794653002301811653002001834653001801854653002701872653002201899700002001921773010301941856008802044852000902132655001202141IND60113805520221207124225.0161019e201307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011380552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molbiopara.2013.05.0022doi7 aPMC38883572pmcid7 a236853432pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMerritt, Christopher10aIdentification of essential and non-essential protein kinases by a fusion PCR method for efficient production of transgenic Trypanosoma brucei  ap. 44-49.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aManipulation of gene expression has been used to elucidate gene function, explore fundamental biological processes and to identify potential drug targets in Trypanosoma brucei. We show in bloodstream forms that CDC2-related kinase CRK12 (Tb11.01.4130) is essential since transcriptional inactivation in conditional null mutants is lethal but 19 other protein kinases are not essential since null mutants are viable. We did so using efficient methods for the generation of null and conditional null cell lines of T. brucei by approaches that generate transfection constructs with large targeting sequences and which use reliable transfection and selection conditions. These methods, which are described in detail in the supplementary material, employ multiple oligonucleotides and PCR reactions and several transfections but are cost effective and can simultaneously generate 24 transfectants thus shifting the rate limiting experimental steps from the production of cell lines to their analysis.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aTrypanosoma brucei 3abloodstream forms 3acost effectiveness 3adrugs 3agene expression 3agenes 3agenetically modified organisms 3amutants 3aoligonucleotides 3aparasitology 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aprotein kinases 3atranscription (genetics) 3atransfection 0aTrypanosoma brucei 0aProtein kinases 0aGene knockout 0aConditional expression 0aFusion PCR method1 aStuart, Kenneth0 tMolecular and biochemical parasitology.g2013 July, v. 190 p.44-49dElsevier B.V.x0166-68517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molbiopara.2013.05.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02848naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024004400110040001800154100001600172245012200188300001300310500002000323520111400343592002801457650000901485650001301494650001701507650002601524650001901550650001401569650002501583650001201608650007001620650005601690650000901746650005401755650001101809650002201820650000901842650006801851650001501919650001401934650005301948650001702001650002202018700001702040700001602057700001402073773013102087852000902218856009102227655001202318IND2057284020221120171720.0211130e199701  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205728402DNAL7 a91211342pmid7 a10.1111/j.1748-5827.1997.tb02977.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeynold, Y.10aClinical, epidemiological and treatment results of idiopathic epilepsy in 54 labrador retrievers: a long‐term study  ap. 7-14.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe records of 54 labrador retrievers with idiopathic epilepsy were reviewed. Exogenous factors played a minor role in the transmission of the epilepsy. Prodromal phase and aura were present in the majority of the dogs with generalised seizures. The ictal phase was characterised by long‐lasting automatisms. Approximately half of the dogs had seizures more than once a month; the remainder ranged from one every two months to one every 12 months. The average frequency in dogs with generalised seizures (n = 49) was one every 65 days and in dogs with partial seizures (n 5) one every 205 days. Long‐term follow‐up was performed in 46 dogs, 37 of which followed a strict treatment protocol. Possible causes for the large variations in treatment results were analysed. One goal was identify objective aspects enabling a realistic prognosis prior to treatment. Animals with a high age at onset of seizure (mean, four years) showed an excellent outcome, even if treatment began late. Dogs with low frequency rates and low total numbers of seizures responded well to therapy if treated as early as possible.  aPublisher supplied data 3adogs 3aepilepsy 3aepidemiology 3aenvironmental factors 3adisease course 3aprognosis 2aAdministration, Oral 2aAnimals 2aAnticonvulsantsxadministration & dosagexbloodxtherapeutic use. 2aDog Diseasesxdrug therapyxepidemiologyxetiology. 2aDogs 2aEpilepsyxdrug therapyxepidemiologyxveterinary. 2aFemale 2aFollow-Up Studies 2aMale 2aPhenobarbitalxadministration & dosagexbloodxtherapeutic use. 2aPrevalence 2aPrognosis 2aSeizuresxetiologyxphysiopathologyxveterinary. 2aTime Factors 2aTreatment Outcome1 aFaissler, D.1 aSteffen, F.1 aJaggy, A.0 tjournal of small animal practice.g1997 Jan., v. 38, no. 1 p.7-14dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl45484x0022-45107nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1748-5827.1997.tb02977.x3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03402naa a2200757 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001400188245011600202300001800318506007600336520123000412592002801642506003701670650001501707650001201722650002501734650002001759650001401779650001901793650000901812650001601821653000901837653000701846653000701853653000801860653001001868653001201878653001001890653002501900653002101925653002501946653004701971653001802018700001502036700002602051700002002077700001302097700001702110700001702127700001602144700001502160700001602175700001702191700001402208700001402222700001702236700001602253700001602269700001602285700001802301700001702319700001802336700002002354700001502374700005402389773009902443856008102542852000902623655001202632IND60528775720221207095432.0160723e20160717xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052877572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jmb.2016.04.0252doi7 aPMC49428382pmcid7 a271171892pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, W.14aThe Nucleosome Remodeling and Deacetylase Complex NuRD Is Built from Preformed Catalytically Active Sub-modules  ap. 2931-2942.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe nucleosome remodeling deacetylase (NuRD) complex is a highly conserved regulator of chromatin structure and transcription. Structural studies have shed light on this and other chromatin modifying machines, but much less is known about how they assemble and whether stable and functional sub-modules exist that retain enzymatic activity. Purification of the endogenous Drosophila NuRD complex shows that it consists of a stable core of subunits, while others, in particular the chromatin remodeler CHD4, associate transiently. To dissect the assembly and activity of NuRD, we systematically produced all possible combinations of different components using the MultiBac system, and determined their activity and biophysical properties. We carried out single-molecule imaging of CHD4 in live mouse embryonic stem cells, in the presence and absence of one of core components (MBD3), to show how the core deacetylase and chromatin-remodeling sub-modules associate in vivo. Our experiments suggest a pathway for the assembly of NuRD via preformed and active sub-modules. These retain enzymatic activity and are present in both the nucleus and the cytosol, an outcome with important implications for understanding NuRD function.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDrosophila 3acytosol 3aembryonic stem cells 3aenzyme activity 3aequipment 3aimage analysis 3amice 3anucleosomes 0aNuRD 0aES 0aMS 0aSEC 0aMALLS 0asptPALM 0amESCs 0achromatin-remodeling 0acomplex assembly 0ahistone modification 0anucleosome remodeling and deacetylase NuRD 0atranscription1 aAubert, A.1 aGomez de Segura, J.M.1 aKaruppasamy, M.1 aBasu, S.1 aMurthy, A.S.1 aDiamante, A.1 aDrury, T.A.1 aBalmer, J.1 aCramard, J.1 aWatson, A.A.1 aLando, D.1 aLee, S.F.1 aPalayret, M.1 aKloet, S.L.1 aSmits, A.H.1 aDeery, M.J.1 aVermeulen, M.1 aHendrich, B.1 aKlenerman, D.1 aSchaffitzel, C.1 aBerger, I.1 aLaue, E.D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7476-41480 tJournal of Molecular Biology.g2016 July 17, v. 428 p.2931-2942dElsevier Ltdx0022-28367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2016.04.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02127naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001300146245015600159300001600315520104700331592002801378650001401406650001601420650001301436650001801449650001101467650002101478700001601499700001901515700001601534700001701550773013101567856008201698852000901780655001201789IND60562048620221118140542.0170125e20170125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056204862DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.6b040472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuo, Kun10aComputational Fluid Dynamics–Discrete Element Method Investigation of Pressure Signals and Solid Back-Mixing in a Full-Loop Circulating Fluidized Bed  ap. 799-813.  aComputational fluid dynamics combined with discrete element method is employed to investigate the pressure signals and solid back-mixing behavior in a three-dimensional full-loop circulating fluidized bed operating in fast fluidization (FF) and dilute phase transport (DPT) regimes. The minimum fluidization velocity is successfully predicted after model validation. The gas–solid full-loop hydrodynamics is accurately captured. Pressure signals under different fluidization regimes shed light on the flow dynamics. The wider solid residence time distribution (RTD) curve with a longer tail in the FF regime indicates that solid flow closes to perfect mixing flow, and more severe solid back-mixing is due to solid internal circulation existing in the riser. The smaller solid RTD curve with a short tail in the DPT regime suggests that the solid flow deviates a little from plug flow, and a small-scale solid back-mixing is due to geometry restraint and recirculating gas–solid flow occurring in the lower and upper regions of the riser.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemistry 3aengineering 3ageometry 3ahydrodynamics 3amixing 3amodel validation1 aWang, Shuai1 aYang, Shiliang1 aHu, Chenshu1 aFan, Jianren0 tIndustrial & Engineering Chemistry Research.g2017 Jan. 25, v. 56, no. 3 p.799-813dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.iecr.6b040473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02412naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245013800175300001600313500001900329520102000348536008801368592002801456596008801484650001801572650001901590650001101609651001301620651001601633651002201649651001901671653001601690653001301706653001801719700002301737700001901760700001801779773011101797856008501908852000901993655001202002IND60697174620221118003608.0200602e20200402xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069717462DNAL7 a10.1080/01650424.2020.17393112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHarrison, Audrey B.10aCollection records and distributional updates of six rarely collected North American large river mayfly taxa (Insecta: Ephemeroptera)  ap. 157-173.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSampling the Lower Mississippi River (LMR) main channel and secondary channels during 2014–2015 and subsequent dietary analysis of river sturgeons (Scaphirhynchus spp.) captured in the Missouri River resulted in the collection of larvae of six mayfly species that specialise in large river habitats. Some of these mayflies are found in large numbers when encountered, while others are infrequently collected and always in low numbers. Two species, Raptoheptagenia cruentata (Walsh, 1863) and Cercobrachys sp. cf. serpentis Soldán, 1986 (Insecta: Ephemeroptera) are reported for Mississippi for the first time. Pseudiron centralis McDunnough, 1931 and R. cruentata are reported for Arkansas for the first time. Updated North American distributions are presented and include records available in major collections and published literature. The apparent restriction of these taxa to large river environments highlights the need for implementation of conservation and restoration efforts to ensure their persistence.  aThis study was supported by US Army Corps of Engineers Mississippi Valley Division.  aPublisher supplied data  cThis study was supported by US Army Corps of Engineers Mississippi Valley Division. 3aEphemeroptera 3aScaphirhynchus 3arivers 3aArkansas 3aMississippi 3aMississippi River 3aMissouri River 0aLarge river 0amayflies 0aNorth America1 aLeonard, Lauren H.1 aStark, Bill P.1 aLago, Paul K.0 tAquatic insects.g2020 Apr. 2, v. 41, no. 2 p.157-173dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl31190x1744-41527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01650424.2020.17393113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02041naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024004400110040001800154100001800172245006900190300001400259500002000273520036900293592002800662650000900690650002500699650002100724650001900745650002300764650002200787650002700809650002200836650001200858650003300870650005500903650005100958650000901009650001101018650006701029650000901096650002501105650001501130650002401145651001201169651002701181700004001208700001401248700001701262773013201279852000901411856009101420655001201511IND2057284520221120161651.0211130e199701  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205728452DNAL7 a91211272pmid7 a10.1111/j.1748-5827.1997.tb02978.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarber, J.

However, the effects of PBDEs and their mechanism of immunotoxicity in dolphins is largely unknown. Previously, we established fibroblast cell lines obtained from pantropical spotted dolphins (PSD-LWHT) as an in vitro model for assessing the toxicological implications of chemical pollutants in dolphins. In this study, we used the novel immortalized fibroblast cell line to explore the potential immune stimulation effect of PBDEs via prostaglandins signaling pathways to better understand the immunotoxicity pathway of PBDEs in dolphins. BDE-47, -100, and −209 exposure generally resulted in an increase in inflammatory cytokine expression, PGE₂ levels, and COX-2 gene expression but BDE-209 resulted in a suppression in IL-10 production. Both protein and mRNA expression of COX-2 and PTGES increased significantly following exposure to the PBDEs. The results suggested BDE-100 and -209 increased prostaglandin E₂ (PGE₂) production via increased expression of COX-2 and PTGES expression. Only BDE-100 increased expression level of the prostaglandin E₂ receptor EP4 while BDE-47 and BDE-209 decreased its expression. This probably explained why suppressive effect on the expression level of anti-inflammatory cytokines were only found in exposure with BDE-47 and BDE-209 rather than BDE-100. The results showed that PBDEs stimulate innate immune response by triggering PGE₂-EPs-cAMP-cytokines signaling.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell lines 3achemical pollutants 3adecabromodiphenyl ether 3adolphins 3afibroblasts 3agene expression 3aimmunotoxicity 3ain vitro studies 3ainnate immunity 3ainterleukin-10 3alongevity 3amessenger RNA 3apredators 3aprostaglandins 3asignal transduction 3atoxicology 3awildlife 0aDolphin 0aSkin fibroblast cell line 0aPolybrominated diphenyl ethers 0aProstaglandin E21 aRajput, Imran Rashid1 aSanganyado, Edmond1 aYajing, Sun1 aYu, Fei1 aLiang, Bo1 aLiu, Wenhua0 tChemosphere.g2020 Sept., v. 254 p.126717-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.1267173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02319naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245003400163300001600197500001900213500002000232520139200252592002801644650001501672650000901687650002001696650002601716651001701742700002001759773014301779856007401922852000901996655001202005IND60706922820221119122854.0200810e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070692282DNAL7 a10.1111/rssb.123552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEngelke, Sebastian10aGraphical models for extremes  ap. 871-932.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aConditional independence, graphical models and sparsity are key notions for parsimonious statistical models and for understanding the structural relationships in the data. The theory of multivariate and spatial extremes describes the risk of rare events through asymptotically justified limit models such as max‐stable and multivariate Pareto distributions. Statistical modelling in this field has been limited to moderate dimensions so far, partly owing to complicated likelihoods and a lack of understanding of the underlying probabilistic structures. We introduce a general theory of conditional independence for multivariate Pareto distributions that enables the definition of graphical models and sparsity for extremes. A Hammersley–Clifford theorem links this new notion to the factorization of densities of extreme value models on graphs. For the popular class of Hüsler–Reiss distributions we show that, similarly to the Gaussian case, the sparsity pattern of a general extremal graphical model can be read off from suitable inverse covariance matrices. New parametric models can be built in a modular way and statistical inference can be simplified to lower dimensional marginals. We discuss learning of minimum spanning trees and model selection for extremal graph structures, and we illustrate their use with an application to flood risk assessment on the Danube river.  aPublisher supplied data 3acovariance 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3astatistical inference 3aDanube River1 aHitz, Adrien S.0 tJournal of the Royal Statistical Society.g2020 Sept., v. 82, no. 4 p.871-932dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3867066x1369-74127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/rssb.123553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03472naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100001800169245016700187300001600354520140300370592002801773650000801801650001701809650000901826650002201835650001101857650001301868650003301881650002001914650001401934650001301948650001401961650003001975650001802005650002802023650002802051650001202079650001802091650002302109650001102132650001302143650001102156650000902167650002802176650001402204650005202218650004202270650001802312651001002330651001002340653002702350653002202377653000802399653002102407700002502428700002102453700001702474700002002491700002602511700002802537773011502565856008502680852000902765655001202774IND60099503220221122072859.0190412e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009950322DNAL7 a229176552pmid7 a10.1016/j.meegid.2012.07.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGupta, Rashmi10aGenetic characterization of UCS region of Pneumocystis jirovecii and construction of allelic profiles of Indian isolates based on sequence typing at three regions  ap. 180-186.  aPneumocystis jirovecii is an opportunistic pathogen that causes severe pneumonia in immunocompromised patients. To study the genetic diversity of P. jirovecii in India the upstream conserved sequence (UCS) region of Pneumocystis genome was amplified, sequenced and genotyped from a set of respiratory specimens obtained from 50 patients with a positive result for nested mitochondrial large subunit ribosomal RNA (mtLSU rRNA) PCR during the years 2005–2008. Of these 50 cases, 45 showed a positive PCR for UCS region. Variations in the tandem repeats in UCS region were characterized by sequencing all the positive cases. Of the 45 cases, one case showed five repeats, 11 cases showed four repeats, 29 cases showed three repeats and four cases showed two repeats. By running amplified DNA from all these cases on a high-resolution gel, mixed infection was observed in 12 cases (26.7%, 12/45). Forty three of 45 cases included in this study had previously been typed at mtLSU rRNA and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region by our group. In the present study, the genotypes at those two regions were combined with UCS repeat patterns to construct allelic profiles of 43 cases. A total of 36 allelic profiles were observed in 43 isolates indicating high genetic variability. A statistically significant association was observed between mtLSU rRNA genotype 1, ITS type Ea and UCS repeat pattern 4.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aPneumocystis 3agels 3agenetic variation 3agenome 3agenotype 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3amixed infection 3apathogens 3apatients 3apneumonia 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aribosomal RNA 3atandem repeat sequences 2a5' Untranslated Regions 2aAlleles 2aBase Sequence 2aConserved Sequence 2aFemale 2aGenotype 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhylogeny 2aPneumocystis cariniixclassificationxgenetics. 2aPneumonia, Pneumocystisxmicrobiology 2aRNAxgenetics 3aIndia 0aIndia 0aPneumocystis jirovecii 0aMultilocus typing 0aUCS 0aAllelic profiles1 aMirdha, Bijay Ranjan1 aGuleria, Randeep1 aKumar, Lalit1 aLuthra, Kalpana1 aAgarwal, Sanjay Kumar1 aSreenivas, Vishnubhatla0 tInfection, genetics, and evolution.g2013 Jan., v. 13 p.180-186dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12450x1567-13487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2012.07.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03029naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245012500167300001600292520133000308536018501638592002801823596007401851650001301925650001401938650002101952650001901973650001701992650001702009650002602026650001702052650001102069650001402080653003202094653001702126653001602143653001902159653001402178700001502192700001902207700002402226700001702250700001502267700002002282773013802302856008602440852000902526655001202535IND60697174920221118003404.0210827e20200503xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069717492DNAL7 a10.1080/03601234.2019.17093772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Jiuyong10aComparative cytotoxic effects of five commonly used triazole alcohol fungicides on human cells of different tissue types  ap. 438-446.  aThe widespread application of triazole fungicides makes people attach great concern over its adverse effects in mammalian. In this paper, cytotoxic effects of triazole alcohol fungicides (TAFs) were assessed on human HeLa, A549, HCT116 and K562 cells, and the potential mechanism of TAFs cytotoxicity was studied preliminarily. Results showed that TAFs had cytotoxicity on human cells with different level and cytotoxic selectivity. TAFs cytotoxicity was resonated with a typical hormetic biphasic dose action that produced a complex pattern of stimulatory or inhibitory effects on cell viability. Among the five TAFs, diniconazole revealed a widest range of cytotoxicity to inhibit the viability of the adherent and the suspension cells, causing HeLa cells shrinkage, A549 cells shrunken, and K562 cells collapse, and showed stronger cytotoxicity than hexaconazole. Moreover, the involvement of ROS generation in the cytotoxicity of TAFs on human cells was observed, and the apoptosis of HeLa cells and the formation of apoptotic body in K562 cells induced by diniconazole were characterized. The results indicated the cytotoxicity of TAFs with different structures on human cells was depended on their own property and cell specificity, K562 cells were the most susceptible to TAFs and diniconazole was the strongest toxic.  aThis work was financially supported by the key scientific and technological project supported by Science and Technology Committee of Shanghai Municipality, China (No. 19391902400).  aPublisher supplied data  a400cScience and Technology Committee of Shanghai Municipality, China 3aalcohols 3aapoptosis 3acell specificity 3acell viability 3acytotoxicity 3adiniconazole 3aenvironmental science 3ahexaconazole 3ahumans 3ashrinkage 0aTriazole alcohol fungicides 0acytotoxicity 0ahuman cells 0aROS generation 0aapoptosis1 aXiong, Hui1 aZhang, Xianfei1 aMuhayimana, Solange1 aLiu, Xuefeng1 aXue, Yufan1 aHuang, Qingchun0 tJournal of environmental science and health.g2020 May 3, v. 55, no. 5 p.438-446dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl11541x1532-41097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03601234.2019.17093773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02827naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245016900167300001600336520131600352592002801668650001501696650002101711650001501732650002101747650002001768650002601788650001001814650001101824650002001835650001501855650001301870650001901883650001401902653001501916653002201931653004601953653002101999653002202020700001402042700001802056700001402074700001402088700001802102700001402120773009602134856008202230852000902312655001202321IND60553487720221119042316.0170502e20151215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055348772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2015.06.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCai, Huai-Hong10aGold nanoprobes-based resonance Rayleigh scattering assay platform: Sensitive cytosensing of breast cancer cells and facile monitoring of folate receptor expression  ap. 165-169.  aA rapid, facile assay for sensitive cytosensing of breast cancer cells should help to guide potential medical evaluation for breast cancer. Here, we report development of novel resonance Rayleigh scattering (RRS) cytosensor for cell recognitions and folate (FA) receptor expression analyses on living cells. Using FA-conjugated gold nanoparticles (FA-AuNPs) as nanoprobes, the constructed nanoprobes-assembled recognition interface could increase the binding capacity for cell recognition, amplify Au-aggregates-enhanced RRS signal, and then enhance the sensitivity for membrane antibody assay. FA-AuNPs-based RRS measurements enabled a distinct 34-times-enhancement in RRS intensities after incubation with human breast cancer cells, compared with normal cells. Receptor-targeted cytosensor was used to quantitatively detect human breast cancer MCF-7, liver cancer HepG2 and normal cells, which expressing different amount of FA receptor, respectively. The detection limit for MCF-7 cells was 12 cells/mL with good selectivity and reproducibility. Furthermore, the proposed cytosensor allowed for dynamic evaluation of FA receptor expression on different living cells after dihydroartemisinin stimulus. This assay platform shows the good potential for clinical diagnostics and antibody-targeted drug screening.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibodies 3abinding capacity 3abiosensors 3abreast neoplasms 3adetection limit 3adiagnostic techniques 3adrugs 3ahumans 3aliver neoplasms 3amonitoring 3ananogold 3aneoplasm cells 3ascreening 0aCytosensor 0aGold nanoparticle 0aResonance Rayleigh scattering enhancement 0aCell recognition 0aReceptor analyses1 aPi, Jiang1 aLin, Xiaoying1 aLi, Baole1 aLi, Aiqun1 aYang, Pei-Hui1 aCai, Jiye0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2015 Dec. 15, v. 74 p.165-169dElsevier B.V.x0956-56637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2015.06.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02954naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006200150245011900212300001600331520153700347592002801884650001801912650002401930650001201954650001401966650002601980650001302006650003002019650001902049650001402068651001302082653001302095653001102108653001102119653000902130653000902139700006202148700002102210700002002231700002002251700001602271773011502287856008502402852000902487655001202496IND60591990820221120063914.0190412e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059199082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.meegid.2018.02.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarkovska, Rumyana1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1634-876810aStatus of Helicobacter pylori cag pathogenicity island (cagPAI) integrity and significance of its individual genes  ap. 167-171.  aOne of the most important virulence factors of H. pylori is the intact cagPAI.The aim of the present study is to investigate cagPAI intactness among Bulgarian H. pylori isolates, its associations with clinical outcomes and vacA alleles, and to evaluate the significance of individual cagPAI genes.Totally, 156 isolates from 156 patients with endoscopic findings for duodenal or gastric ulcer (33 subjects), non-ulcer disease (121) and other diseases, such as Crohn's disease and hepatitis (2) were tested. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to detect 14 essential cagPAI genes, including cagA, as well as vacA s, i and m alleles.CagA positive were 81.4% of all H. pylori isolates. Intact cagPAI was found in 64.1% of the all isolates, 16.7% and 19.2% showed complete and partial cagPAI absence, respectively. The prevalence of all cagPAI genes and intact cagPAI was significantly higher in isolates from ulcer patients compared with those from non-ulcer patients (p = 0.001). The most frequently missing genes among the isolates with partially deleted cagPAIs were cagE or/and cagY (28 of 30 isolates). Overall prevalence of vacA s1a allele was 80.1% and that of vacA i1 was 64.1%. The vacA s1a, m1 and i1 alleles were more prevalent in H. pylori isolates from ulcer patients (p = 0.03, p = 0.009, and p = 0.0003, respectively) and were associated with isolates with intact cagPAI.In Bulgaria the prevalence of intact cagPAI was high. cagE or/and cagY absence was the most important predictor of cagPAI status.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCrohn disease 3aHelicobacter pylori 3aalleles 3ahepatitis 3apathogenicity islands 3apatients 3apolymerase chain reaction 3astomach ulcers 3avirulence 3aBulgaria 0aH pylori 0acagPAI 0aIntact 0acagA 0avacA1 aBoyanova, Lyudmila1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9622-08731 aYordanov, Daniel1 aStankova, Petya1 aGergova, Galina1 aMitov, Ivan0 tInfection, genetics, and evolution.g2018 Apr., v. 59 p.167-171dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12450x1567-13487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2018.02.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02798naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100006300153245011900216520152500335592002801860650001801888650001201906650002801918650001401946650001901960650001601979651001001995653001402005653002002019653002402039653001502063653001102078700006602089700006302155773010902218856008802327852000902415655001202424IND60684709820221120102743.0200405e20200501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068470982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2020.1051462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDíaz-Cuevas, Pilar1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0846-993010aDeveloping a beach erosion sensitivity indicator using relational spatial databases and Analytic Hierarchy Process  aThis paper presents a methodology that is based on the use of relational spatial databases and Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), to generate an indicator of sensitivity to erosive processes for dry beaches, which was then applied in the province of Cádiz (Southern Spain). The variables ‘width of dry beach’; ‘accommodation space – width and type of sedimentary substrate’; and ‘mid-term erosion rate’ (1977–2013) are calculated in detail (1:2500). Following this, the accommodation space variable is weighted according to its sedimentary substrate before calculating the sensitivity indicator by aggregating all variables. Results suggest that Mediterranean beaches are more likely to be erosion sensitive than Atlantic ones. Both groups share similar features: similar dry beach width, a tendency to erode, and the existence of little or no accommodation space.Of those beaches in the extremely sensitive bracket, 29% are located in urban areas, especially common along the Mediterranean facade, where the presence of infrastructure (mainly retaining walls and seaside promenades) prevents both the increase of the beach's potential expansion areas and the oscillation of the shoreline.The methodology developed can be applied to other regions and will be of interest for coastal planners and managers, whom can use this information to understand coastal erosion hazards and to readily identify areas that are less resilient to erosive phenomena and where more detailed analyses should be carried out.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeach erosion 3abeaches 3acoastal zone management 3adatabases 3ainfrastructure 3aurban areas 3aSpain 0aDry beach 0aCoastal erosion 0aAccommodation space 0aResilience 0aCádiz1 aPrieto-Campos, Antonio1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6946-96221 aOjeda-Zújar, José1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4672-064X0 tOcean & coastal management.g2020 May 01, v. 189 p.105146-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11975x0964-56917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2020.1051463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02770naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128100002100146245015500167300001600322520138000338592002801718650003001746650003601776650001501812650001301827650001001840650001901850650002501869650002201894650002201916653003601938653001501974653001801989653001002007700001902017700002002036700001902056700001902075700001802094773013202112852000902244856008302253655001202336IND4372763820221116221101.0181016e200507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437276382DNAL7 a10.1177/1040638705017004102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRayamajhi, Nabin10aDevelopment and Use of a Multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction Assay Based on Apx Toxin Genes for Genotyping of Actinobacillus Pleuropneumoniae Isolates  ap. 359-362.  aActinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (A. pleuropneumoniae) is the etiological agent of a porcine pleuropneumonia that threatens the global swine industry. The major pathogenic toxins of A. pleuropneumoniae include ApxI, ApxII, ApxIII, and ApxIV, which are serotype or serovar specific. Several techniques have been developed for the identification and typing of A. pleuropneumoniae. Serological assays are used to identify and serotype A. pleuropneumoniae, but factors such as cross-reactivity limit their specificity. Labor, time, and the requirement for specific antibodies are also drawbacks of these assays. Multistep polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques based on apx genes have been reported for the identification and typing of A. pleuropneumoniae. This study developed multiplex PCR for the identification and genotyping of A. pleuropneumoniae based on apx genes. This multiplex PCR technique was successful in differentiating 11 of 15 reference serotypes. Five different primer sets were used to amplify the 4 apx genes from each serotype in a single-step reaction. The multiplex PCR reported in this study was further used in genotyping 51 field isolates of A. pleuropneumoniae from different regions of Korea. The concomitant amplification of all 4 apx genes makes multiplex PCR more specific and convenient for the diagnosis and genotyping of A. pleuropneumoniae.  aPublisher supplied data 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aActinobacillus pleuropneumoniae 3acytotoxins 3agenotype 3aswine 3aswine diseases 3abacterial infections 3atoxigenic strains 3asequence analysis 0aActinobacillus pleuropneumoniae 0agenotyping 0amultiplex PCR 0atoxin1 aShin, Sung Jae1 aKang, Sang Gyun1 aLee, Deog Yong1 aAhn, Jeong Min1 aYoo, Han Sang0 tJournal of veterinary diagnostic investigation.g, v. 17, no. 4 p.359-362dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl43656x1040-63877nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1040638705017004103Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02661naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245010600170300001600276500001900292520140900311536012601720592002801846596003401874650002501908650002001933650001001953650002101963650000901984650001401993651001002007653001102017653001202028653001302040700001802053773011002071856008502181852000902266655001202275IND60716595920221120090221.0201106e20201001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071659592DNAL7 a10.1080/00305316.2020.17273762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKalita, Tarali10aCharacterisation of cocoon of different population of Antheraea assamensis (Lepidoptera: Saturniidae)  ap. 574-590.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe characterisation of cocoons is one of the most important requirements to know the economic importance of a sericigenous insect. Antheraea assamensis produces the golden muga silk, which is considered as the second most expensive silk in the world for its high quality. Although muga silk worm is a single species, it has many varieties with respect to its geographical areas. However, literary works on the most important economic traits connected to silk production of different populations of A. assamensis are very limited. Therefore, the present study has been aimed to know the cocoon efficiency and the silk quality of the different populations of the A. assamensis following the standard techniques. The study was performed after collecting the cocoon samples from 11 different regions of the North East India. The result showed that A. assamensis exhibit variation in cocoon colour along with other significant differences in the cocoon weight, shell weight, shell ratio and silk quality. The cocoons of the wild population recorded more cocoon weight, shell ratio, filament length and tenacity but at the same time due to the deposition of higher degree of calcium oxalate crystals on the cocoon surface, they were hard to reel. Based on these characters, the study recommended some stocks, which could be used for future breeding programme based on the genetic distance between the parents.  aThis work was supported by the Department of Science and Technology, Government of India [INSPIRE FELLOWSHIP [IF120486]].  aPublisher supplied data  aINSPIRE FELLOWSHIP [IF120486] 3aAntheraea assamensis 3acalcium oxalate 3acolor 3agenetic distance 3asilk 3asilkworms 3aIndia 0aCocoon 0aeconomy 0abreeding1 aDutta, Karabi0 tOriental insects.g2020 Oct. 01, v. 54, no. 4 p.574-590dTaylor & FranciswJournal:19694x2157-87457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00305316.2020.17273763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02747naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005700148245012400205300002000329520130900349592002801658596007801686596008501764650001501849650001501864650001601879650001501895650001401910650000701924650001401931650001301945650002301958650001601981700001801997700001402015700001702029700001502046700001702061773015502078856008302233852000902316655001202325IND60794804320221117223249.0220929e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079480432DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-022-20048-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Jingqing1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8686-741910aRemoval behavior and mechanism of amino/carboxylate-functionalized Fe@SiO2 for Cr(VI) and Cd(II) from aqueous solutions  ap. 72058-72073.  aThe novel iron-based reductive particles, functionalized with amino and carboxylic functional groups, were synthesized to remove Cr(VI) and Cd(II) ions from aqueous solutions. The morphological structure and surface functional groups of new composites were characterized with SEM, XRD, FTIR, BET, and other techniques. The influence of pH, initial concentration, adsorbent dosing, and temperature on removal efficiencies were explored by batch experiments. The adsorption capacity of Cr(VI) and Cd(II) increased by 159.95% and 76.60%, respectively, compared with Fe⁰, reaching 47.638 and 62.047 mg/g. EDS and XPS analysis showed most of Cr(VI) was reduced to Cr(III) and precipitated as ferrochrome oxide, and Cd(II) was mainly precipitated as hydroxide. Reduction-precipitation and complexation may predominate in the removal process of Cr(VI), which fitted well with Langmuir and Freundlich models and pseudo-second-order kinetics. While hydrolysis and complexation may prevail for Cd(II), which was suited with Langmuir model and pseudo-second-order kinetics. Having good magnetic properties, the A/C-Fe@SiO₂ particles exhibited excellent reusable stability after four times regeneration experiments, promising a prospect for in-situ remediations of groundwater contaminated by Cr(VI) and Cd(II).  aPublisher supplied data  aNo. 181100310300cNational Major Science and Technology Projects of China  aNo. 2017ZX07602-003-002cNational Major Science and Technology Projects of China 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3agroundwater 3ahydrolysis 3amagnetism 3apH 3apollution 3aresearch 3asorption isotherms 3atemperature1 aLiu, Xiaobang1 aRen, Peng1 aGao, Jianlei1 aChen, Yong1 aChen, Zhijun0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2022 Oct., v. 29, no. 47 p.72058-72073dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-022-20048-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02649naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245009100167300001600258520124800274592002801522650001601550650001301566650002101579650002201600650002801622650001901650650001301669650001801682650001101700650002101711650001701732653004201749653001301791653004301804653001501847653001701862700001801879700001601897700001601913700002001929700001601949700001501965773009201980856008602072852000902158655001202167IND60635791820221119114050.0190523e20190815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063579182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2019.03.1142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFan, Lifang10aDesign of a facile and label-free electrochemical aptasensor for detection of atrazine  ap. 156-164.  aA facile and label-free electrochemical aptasensor for detection of atrazine (ATZ) was designed based on nickel hexacyanoferrate nanoparticles (NiHCF NPs) and electrochemically reduced graphene oxide (ERGO). Because of ERGO perfect electrochemical conductivity and large surface area, it was first modified on glassy carbon electrode (GCE) surface by electrochemical reduction. NiHCF NPs were immobilized on ERGO/GCE as a signal probe with well-defined peaks and good stability. Subsequently, gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) were electrodeposited on NiHCF NPs/ERGO to anchored aptamer and increase the conductivity and stability of the electrode. When ATZ was added, ATZ-aptamer complexes generated with poor conductivity on the sensor surface increased the hindrance of electron transfer, leading to electrochemical signal decrease. The signal change was used to detect ATZ quantitatively. The designed aptasensor exhibited good analytical performance for determining ATZ. A linear curve was obtained in the range of 0.25–250 pM with a low detection limit of 0.1 pM, and it showed perfect selectivity for ATZ in the presence of diverse interferents. Meanwhile, the electrochemical aptasensor was employed to evaluate ATZ content in the samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaptasensors 3aatrazine 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectron transfer 3aglassy carbon electrode 3agraphene oxide 3ananogold 3ananoparticles 3anickel 3aoligonucleotides 3asurface area 0aNickel hexacyanoferrate nanoparticles 0aAtrazine 0aElectrochemical reduced graphene oxide 0aAptasensor 0aSignal probe1 aZhang, Caiyun1 aYan, Wenjun1 aGuo, Yujing1 aShuang, Shaomin1 aDong, Chuan1 aBi, Yingpu0 tTalanta.g2019 Aug. 15, v. 201 p.156-164dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2019.03.1143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02653naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245016900170300001600339500001900355520135800374592002801732650001601760650001601776650001701792650001701809650001801826650001001844653001701854653002801871653002701899653002301926653002801949653002901977700002702006700001802033773011002051856008502161852000902246655001202255IND60716596020221120115105.0201106e20201001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071659602DNAL7 a10.1080/00305316.2020.17627752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnwar, Khoirul10aComb Establishment of fungus-growing termites species Macrotermitinae (Isoptera: Termitidae) with Termitomyces cylindricus (Basidiomycota: Agaricales) basidiospores  ap. 591-606.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aCombs have a significant role as substrates for Termitomyces in providing nutrients for Macrotermitinae colonies. However, the process of comb establishment was poorly known. The study was to observe the process of fungal comb formation of fungus-growing termites in the laboratory. Each pair of alates from three species, i.e Microtermes insperatus Kemner, Macrotermes gilvus Hagen, and Odontotermes bogoriensis Kemner were reared and introduced to Termitomyces sp. basidiospores, meanwhile another pairs that were not introduced to the basidiospores were acted as the control. M. insperatus introduced with and without basidiospore established 100 % of developed combs and 33.33 % of developed combs respectively. M. insperatus that succeed in making developed comb had a relatively similar pattern in growth of colony members between those introduced and not introduced with basidiospores, however, they were in contrast to M. insperatus that did not succeed in making developed combs. M. gilvus and O. bogoriensis that were or were not introduced with basidiospore established 0 % of the developed comb. The combs were observed for the first time in the 15ᵗʰ week of the rearing period. The fungus in developed combs of M. insperatus introduced to basidiospores and the culture of Termitomyces sp. were in one clade with Termitomyces cylindricus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMacrotermes 3aMicrotermes 3aOdontotermes 3aTermitomyces 3abasidiospores 3afungi 0aFungal combs 0afungus-growing termites 0aMicrotermes insperatus 0aMacrotermes gilvus 0aOdontotermes bogoriesis 0aTermitomyces cylindricus1 aSudirman, Lisdar Idwan1 aNandika, Dodi0 tOriental insects.g2020 Oct. 01, v. 54, no. 4 p.591-606dTaylor & FranciswJournal:19694x2157-87457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00305316.2020.17627753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02450naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245018000163300001600343520110500359592002801464650003001492650001601522650001701538650001501555650001201570650002201582650002001604650002401624650001301648650004301661650002501704700001901729700001701748700001801765700001801783700001601801700001601817773013801833856004801971852000902019655001202028IND50073657120221119091318.0140306e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007365712DNAL7 a10.1007/s00343-014-3111-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYou, Liping10aExpression profiles of two small heat shock proteins and antioxidant enzyme activity in Mytilus galloprovincialis exposed to cadmium at environmentally relevant concentrations  ap. 334-343.  aSmall heat shock proteins encompass a widespread but diverse class of proteins, which play key roles in protecting organisms from various stressors. In the present study, the full-length cDNAs of two small heat shock proteins (MgsHSP22 and MgsHSP24.1) were cloned from Mytilus galloprovincialis, which encoded peptides of 181 and 247 amino acids, respectively. Both MgsHSP22 and MgsHSP24.1 were detected in all tissues examined by real-time PCR, with the highest expression being observed in muscle and gonad tissues. The real-time PCR results revealed that Cd significantly inhibited MgsHSP22 expression at 24 h and MgsHSP24.1 at 24 and 48 h under 5 μg/L Cd ²⁺ exposure. MgsHSP24.1 expression was also significantly inhibited after 50 μg/L Cd²⁺ exposure for 48 h. With regard to antioxidant enzymes, increased GPx and CAT activity were detected under Cd²⁺ stress (5 and 50 μg/L), while no significant difference in SOD activity was observed throughout the experiment. Overall, both MgsHsps and antioxidant enzymes revealed their potential as Cd stress biomarkers in M. galloprovincialis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMytilus galloprovincialis 3aamino acids 3aantioxidants 3abiomarkers 3acadmium 3acomplementary DNA 3aenzyme activity 3aheat shock proteins 3apeptides 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asuperoxide dismutase1 aNing, Xuanxuan1 aChen, Leilei1 aZhang, Linbao1 aZhao, Jianmin1 aLiu, Xiaoli1 aWu, Huifeng0 tChinese journal of oceanology and limnology.g2014 Mar., v. 32, no. 2 p.334-343dSpringer-VerlagwJournal:J000001677x0254-40597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00343-014-3111-9  aDNAL 7aarticle02707naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006100147245010600208506010400314506007600418520121700494592002801711506003701739650002901776650002201805650001601827650001101843650002101854651001001875653003801885653003401923653004101957653002701998653003402025700001802059700002302077773011802100856008202218852000902300655001202309IND60767281120221207122613.0220809e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076728112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.eti.2022.1024012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aK., Swarna Swetha1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9892-847X10aImplementing construction waste management in India: An extended theory of planned behaviour approach  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIndividual’s attitude & behaviour is crucial for implementing sustainable construction & demolition (C & D) waste management, however it is often underachieved. The present article explores the motivators of workforce towards implementation of construction waste management (CWM) in India. A hypothetical model using theory of planned behaviour (TPB) is framed fundamentally by incorporating constructs such as knowledge and perceived usefulness. The extended TPB (ETPB) model is then tested via structural equation modelling which utilizes, empirical data from construction workforce in India for the analysis. The analysis results conclude, perceived behaviour control is consistently crucial construct for predicting behaviour intention in comparison with attitude and subjective norm. The additional constructs Knowledge has significant behavioural impact on implementation of CWM, and the impact of subjective norm and perceived usefulness are insignificant. The study is pertinent to: (i) policy makers — for establishing regulations & practices, (ii) corporates — for devising effective approaches, (iii) academia — for encouraging attitude and behavioural changes towards implementation of CWM.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aenvironmental technology 3aissues and policy 3alabor force 3amodels 3awaste management 3aIndia 0aConstruction and demolition waste 0aConstruction waste management 0aExtended theory of planned behaviour 0aAttitude and behaviour 0aStructural equation modelling1 aT.P., Tezeswi1 aM.V.N., Siva Kumar0 tEnvironmental technology & innovation.g2022 Aug., v. 27 p.102401-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23259x2352-18647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eti.2022.1024013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03177naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245017600169300001400345520163500359592002801994650003202022650002202054650001002076650001402086650002002100650002002120650003802140650001002178650001902188650000902207650001102216650002902227653000802256653000902264653000702273653001002280653001002290653000902300653001002309653002302319653000902342653001902351653001502370653000802385700002302393700003302416700002302449773007202472856008202544852000902626655001202635IND60552352820221119174532.0161021e20140101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055235282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gene.2013.10.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGoldman, Andrés10aIdentifier (ID) elements are not preferentially located to brain-specific genes: High ID element representation in other tissue-specific- and housekeeping genes of the rat  ap. 72-77.  aBC1 is a short non-coding RNA from rodents, which is transcribed by RNA pol III. Its RNA is highly abundant in the brain, where it exerts a post-transcriptional regulatory role in dendrites. Upon transcription, retroposition and insertion, BC1 gives rise to a subclass of short interspersed repetitive sequences (SINEs) named identifier (ID) elements. IDs can become integrated inside non-coding regions of RNA pol II transcription units, and — although challenged by a couple of reports — their preferential location to brain-specific genes has been long proposed. Furthermore, an additional, cis-regulatory role in the control of brain-specific pol II-directed transcripts has been suggested for these sequences.In this work we used Northern blot and in silico analyses to examine IDs' location among pol II transcription units in different tissues, and in housekeeping genes. ID sequences appeared distributed in a similar fashion within tissue-specific hnRNA populations of the brain, testis and liver, and within housekeeping primary transcripts as well. Moreover, when the lengths of the unprocessed transcripts were considered, ID representation was higher in housekeeping ones.On the other hand, ID elements appeared similarly distributed among the different gene regions, with the obvious exclusion of those sequences where strict constraints for proper gene expression exist.Altogether, the widespread distribution of ID elements in all the analyzed genes — including housekeeping — and in all gene regions, suggests a random location, raising questions about the specific cis-regulatory role of those sequences.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA-directed RNA polymerase 3aNorthern blotting 3abrain 3adendrites 3aessential genes 3agene expression 3ainterspersed repetitive sequences 3aliver 3anon-coding RNA 3arats 3atestes 3atranscription (genetics) 0apol 0aSINE 0aID 0ahnRNA 0aeIF4A 0aPABP 0apt(s) 0aIdentifier element 0aSINE 0aRepetitive DNA 0aRat genome 0aBC11 aCapoano, Carlos A.1 aGonzález-López, Evangelina1 aGeisinger, Adriana0 tGene.g2014 Jan. 01, v. 533 p.72-77dElsevier B.V.x0378-11197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2013.10.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03577naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245011500158300001600273520202700289592002802316650000802344650002502352650002102377650001702398650001502415650002402430650001002454650001602464650001902480650002002499650002002519650001602539650002102555650001102576650001402587650001302601650001502614650001802629700002102647700001402668700002502682700002502707700002902732700001702761700001602778700001802794700001502812773012502827856007402952852000903026655001203035IND60663932920221119105807.0190910e20150511xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066393292DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ib00285g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aObaid, Ayesha10aModeling and analysis of innate immune responses induced by the host cells against hepatitis C virus infection  ap. 544-559.  aAn in-depth understanding of complex systems such as hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and host immunomodulatory response is an open challenge for biologists. In order to understand the mechanisms involved in immune evasion by HCV, we present a simplified formalization of the highly dynamic system consisting of HCV, its replication cycle and host immune responses at the cellular level using hybrid Petri net (HPN). The approach followed in this study comprises of step wise simulation, model validation and analysis of host immune response. This study was performed with an objective of making correlations among viral RNA levels, interferon (IFN) production and interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) induction. The results correlate with the biological data verifying that the model is very useful in predicting the dynamic behavior of the signaling proteins in response to a stimulus. This study implicates that HCV infection is dependent upon several key factors of the host immune response. The effect of host proteins on limiting viral infection is effectively overruled by the viral pathogen. This study also analyzes activity levels of RNase L, miR-122, IFN, ISGs and PKR induction and inhibition of TLR3/RIG1 mediated pathways in response to targeted manipulation in the presence of HCV. The results are in complete agreement at the time of writing with the published expression studies and western blot experiments. Our model also provides some biological insights regarding the role of PKR in the acute infection of HCV. It might help to explain why many patients fail to clear acute HCV infection while others, with low ISG basal levels, clear HCV spontaneously. The described methodology can easily be reproduced, which suitably supports the study of other viral infections in a formal, automated and expressive manner. The Petri net-based modeling approach applied here may provide valuable insights for study design and analyses to evaluate other disease associated integrated pathways in biological systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA 3aToll-like receptor 3 3aWestern blotting 3aacute course 3aautomation 3aexperimental design 3agenes 3ahepatitis C 3aimmune evasion 3aimmune response 3ainnate immunity 3ainterferons 3amodel validation 3amodels 3apathogens 3apatients 3aprediction 3aribonucleases1 aAḥmad, Jamīl,1 aNaz, Anam1 aAwan, Faryal Mehwish1 aParacha, Rehan Zafar1 aTareen, Samar Hayat Khan1 aAnjum, Sadia1 aRaza, Abida1 aBaumbach, Jan1 aAli, Amjad0 tIntegrative biology.g2015 May 11, v. 7, no. 5 p.544-559dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26905x1757-97087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ib00285g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02998naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245013600163300001600299520110900315592002801424650001901452650002101471650002501492650002601517650001001543650002501553650002201578650003401600650001301634650001501647650004301662650002201705650002401727650000901751650001901760653000901779653000801788653000801796653000701804653000701811653001301818653002001831653001201851653002401863653002201887700001701909700001801926700001901944700001301963700001701976700002001993700001702013700001402030700001502044700001602059700001602075700001902091700001902110700001802129773007402147856008202221852000902303655001202312IND60552352920221119174459.0161021e20140125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055235292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gene.2013.09.1212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Linlin10aGlucagon gene polymorphism modifies the effects of smoking and physical activity on risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus in Han Chinese  ap. 352-355.  aFew genome-wide association studies have considered interactions between multiple genetic variants and environmental factors associated with disease. The interaction was examined between a glucagon gene (GCG) polymorphism and smoking, alcohol consumption and physical activity and the association with risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in a case–control study of Chinese Han subjects. The rs12104705 polymorphism of GCG and interactions with environmental variables were analyzed for 9619 participants by binary multiple logistic regression. Smoking with the C-C haplotype of rs12104705 was associated with increased risk of T2DM (OR=1.174, 95% CI=1.013–1.361). Moderate and high physical activity with the C-C genotype was associated with decreased risk of T2DM as compared with low physical activity with the genotype (OR=0.251, 95% CI=0.206–0.306 and OR=0.190, 95% CI=0.164–0.220). However, the interaction of drinking and genotype was not associated with risk of T2DM. Genetic polymorphism in rs12104705 of GCG may interact with smoking and physical activity to modify the risk of T2DM.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChinese people 3aalcohol drinking 3acase-control studies 3aenvironmental factors 3agenes 3agenetic polymorphism 3agenetic variation 3agenome-wide association study 3aglucagon 3ahaplotypes 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3aphysical activity 3aregression analysis 3arisk 3arisk reduction 0aGWAS 0aMAF 0aSNP 0aOR 0aCI 0aGenetics 0aType 2 diabetes 0aSmoking 0aAlcohol consumption 0aPhysical activity1 aGao, Kaiping1 aZhao, Jingzhi1 aFeng, Tianping1 aYin, Lei1 aWang, Jinjin1 aWang, Chongjian1 aLi, Chunyang1 aWang, Yan1 aWang, Qian1 aZhai, Yujia1 aYou, Haifei1 aRen, Yongcheng1 aWang, Bingyuan1 aHu, Dongsheng0 tGene.g2014 Jan. 25, v. 534 p.352-355dElsevier B.V.x0378-11197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2013.09.1213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03560naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002000144245009900164300001800263520221800281592002802499650001302527650001502540650002902555650001902584650001402603650001302617650000902630650001702639650002302656650001102679653002302690653002002713653002302733653002202756700001802778700002002796700001902816700001302835700002402848773015402872856007903026852000903105655001203114IND60531733120221121220244.0190318e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053173312DNAL7 a10.3168/jds.2016-109012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 avan Hoeij, R.J.10aCow characteristics and their association with udder health after different dry period lengths  ap. 8330-8340.  aShortening or omitting the dry period (DP) in dairy cows is of interest because of potential beneficial effects on energy balance and metabolic health. Reported effects of a short or omitted dry period on udder health are ambiguous. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of no DP (0d), a short DP (30d), or a conventional DP (60d) on the occurrence of intramammary infections (IMI) during the precalving period and on somatic cell counts (SCC), elevations of SCC (SCC≥200,000 cells/mL), and clinical mastitis in the subsequent lactation. The study also aimed to analyze which prepartum cow characteristics are associated with udder health after different DP lengths. Holstein-Friesian dairy cows (n=167) were randomly assigned to a DP length (0, 30, or 60d). Cows with a 0-d DP had a greater occurrence of chronic IMI and a lower occurrence of cured IMI during the precalving period than cows with a 30-d or 60-d DP. Postpartum average SCC for lactation was greater in cows with a 0-d DP than in cows with a 30-d or 60-d DP. The number of cows with at least 1 elevation of SCC, the number of elevations of SCC per affected cow, the number of cows treated for clinical mastitis, and the number of cases of mastitis per affected cow did not differ among DP lengths. Cow characteristics related to postpartum average SCC for lactation were DP length, parity, and the following interactions: DP length with prepartum elevation of SCC, DP length with fat- and protein-corrected milk (FPCM) reduction between 150 and 67d prepartum, DP length with parity and with average SCC for lactation, and last FPCM before the conventional drying-off day with average SCC for lactation. Cows with prepartum parity 1 had a lower occurrence of at least 1 elevation of SCC in subsequent lactation compared with cows with parity >2. Last SCC before the conventional drying-off day was positively associated with occurrence of clinical mastitis in the subsequent lactation. In this study, DP length was not a risk factor for either elevation of SCC or occurrence of clinical mastitis in the subsequent lactation. The identified cow characteristics could be used in a decision support model to optimize DP length for individual cows.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolstein 3adairy cows 3adecision support systems 3aenergy balance 3alactation 3amastitis 3amilk 3arisk factors 3asomatic cell count 3audders 0acontinuous milking 0adecision making 0asomatic cell count 0aclinical mastitis1 aLam, T.J.G.M.1 ade Koning, D.B.1 aSteeneveld, W.1 aKemp, B.1 avan Knegsel, A.T.M.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2016 Oct., v. 99, no. 10 p.8330-8340dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2016-109013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03335naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245016900165520161500334592002801949650002101977650001901998650001802017650002002035650002002055650002602075650002002101650001902121650001602140650002402156650003302180650000902213650001802222650001602240650002902256650001202285650000902297650004302306653003302349653002702382653002302409653003602432653004002468653003502508700001502543700001802558700002102576773011302597856008602710852000902796655001202805IND60687940720221119024943.0200809e20200720xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068794072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1213232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFink, Rok10aBalancing chemical function with reduced environmental health hazards: A joint probability approach to examine antimicrobial product efficacy and mammalian toxicity  aThe fourth principle of Green Chemistry, a critically important area of sustainability science, identifies that substances should maintain intended functions while possessing limited intrinsic hazards to public health and the environment. In the present study, we empirically determined efficacy of 20 cleaning products against E. coli attachment to surfaces. Subsequently, probabilistic assessments using novel chemical efficacy distributions (CEDs) were conducted. Results for most chemicals indicated bacterial detachment with increasing concentration. Using a threshold concentration of 5th centiles, these cleaning product ingredients were predicted to detach E. coli (Lowest Observable Effect Concentration) at or below 0.7 (0.2, 2.2) mg L⁻¹ for 5% of ingredients. We then employed chemical toxicity distributions (CTDs) to examine acute toxicity, based on currently available information, for common mammalian models. Results demonstrate that probabilities of associated hazards for rat (oral exposure route), mouse (oral exposure route), rabbit (dermal exposure route), and rat (inhalation exposure route) were 43.2%, 36.7%, 38.6% and 75.5%, respectively. A novel joint probability distribution analysis approach was then developed and applied to identify substances with various efficacy (CED) and hazard (CTD) characteristics. Our observations indicate that combining efficacy and toxicity information using joint probability curves may be useful for identifying classes of antimicrobial products, and other chemical classes, to optimize efficacy while minimizing environment and health hazards.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aacute toxicity 3aanimal models 3acleaning agents 3adermal exposure 3aenvironmental hazards 3agreen chemistry 3ahealth hazards 3aingredients 3ainhalation exposure 3alowest observed effect level 3amice 3aoral exposure 3aprobability 3aprobability distribution 3arabbits 3arats 3asustainability science and engineering 0aCleaning product ingredients 0aAntimicrobial efficacy 0aMammalian toxicity 0aChemical toxicity distributions 0aThresholds of toxicological concern 0aJoint probability distribution1 aWang, Zhen1 aOder, Martina1 aBrooks, Bryan W.0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2020 July 20, v. 262 p.121323-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1213233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02648naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002500148245018400173300001600357520100100373592002801374650002301402650001201425650002401437650001101461650001701472650001801489650002001507650002101527650002101548650002801569650004201597650001401639650001701653653002401670653001701694653003101711653001201742653002701754700002001781700002001801700006401821700003101885700002101916773012501937856008302062852000902145655001202154IND60628890620221119125518.0201125e20180801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062889062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2018.03.0952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMuthusankar, Ganesan10aElectrochemical synthesis of nitrogen-doped carbon quantum dots decorated copper oxide for the sensitive and selective detection of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug in berries  ap. 191-200.  aWe report a sensitive non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug aspirin (ASA) sensor studies using the nitrogen-doped carbon quantum dots (N-CQD) decorated copper oxide (Cu₂O).

In late May 2019, a leaf spot disease of A. triloba was observed on approximately 35% of plants in the Xinjiang Alaer city (40°33′20′′N, 81°17′19′′E). The disease symptoms began as small, suborbicular, brown spots on the leaves. As the disease progressed, the spots enlarged and coalesced into large necrotic areas and resulted in premature defoliation. Leaf sections (5 × 5 mm) from infected leaves were surface sterilized with 75% ethanol for 30 s and 0.1% HgCl₂ for 1 min, rinsed three times in sterile distilled water, and then incubated on potato dextrose agar (PDA). Fifteen fungal isolates showing similar morphological characteristics were obtained by single-spore isolation. On the PDA plates, all fungal colonies had a dark olive color with loose, cottony mycelium. On potato carrot agar, the fungus formed unbranched spore chains but occasionally formed one or two lateral branches. Conidiophores were short, hazel-colored, septae, arising singly, and measuring 15.1 to 61.8 × 1.8 to 4.2 µm (35.2 ± 1.4 × 2.3 ± 0.1 µm, n = 50). Mature conidia were ellipsoidal to ovoid with a short conical beak at the tip, light brown, with zero to three longitudinal septa and one to five transverse septa, and measuring 19.3 to 30.8 × 7.2 to 12.5 µm (21.8 ± 0.3 × 9.5 ± 0.2 µm, n = 50). Based on the cultural and morphological traits, the pathogen was preliminarily identified as Alternaria tenuissima (Simmons 2007). Genomic DNA was extracted from the representative isolate YALAR-1, and the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region, the partial coding sequence of endopolygalacturonase (endoPG), the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDA), and the partial region of the histone 3 (H3) genes were amplified using primers ITS1/ITS4 (White et al. 1990), PG2b/PG3a (Andrew et al. 2009), GDF1/GDR1 (Berbee et al. 1999), and H3-1a/H3-1b (Glass and Donaldson 1995), respectively. The amplicons were sequenced and deposited in GenBank (MT459807 [ITS], MT459808 [endoPG], MT459805 [GAPDA], MT459806 [H3]). MegaBLAST analyses revealed that our ITS, endoPG, GAPDA, and H3 sequences were 99 to 100% identical to those of A. tenuissima isolates in GenBank (AF347032 [ITS], KP124026 [endoPG], AY278809 [GAPDA], KF997086 [H3]), confirming the identity of the pathogen as A. tenuissima. Pathogenicity tests were performed by inoculating the fungus onto healthy, mature leaves of A. triloba in the field. Twenty-five leaves (five leaves per plant) were sprayed with spore suspensions (1 × 10⁶ spores/ml) of each fungal pathogen, and the same number of leaves were sprayed with distilled water as controls. Inoculated and control leaves were covered with clear plastic bags for 3 days. The experiment was repeated three times. Twelve days after inoculation, the observed symptoms were similar to the original symptoms, and the same fungal pathogen was reisolated from the inoculated leaves and identified as A. tenuissima based on morphological features and sequence analysis. The control leaves remained asymptomatic and no fungus was isolated from these leaves. Previously, a leaf spot of A. triloba caused by Alternaria brassicae was reported in Dalian, China (Xie et al. 2017). To control this disease effectively, further studies are needed on the biology and ecology of A. tenuissima and A. brassicae, respectively. To our knowledge, this is the first report of A. tenuissima associated with leaf spot disease on A. triloba in China. In late September 2020, the diseased plant rate increased to 38% in Alaer city. If the disease control and prevention is neglected, the landscape of Alaer city will be affected seriously. So, to effectively control the spread of the disease, it is urgent now to study the sensitivity of the pathogen to fungicide and carry out field efficacy trials.  aPublisher supplied data  a31560007cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a202010757021cNational training program of innovation and entrepreneurship for undergraduates 3aAlternaria brassicae 3aAlternaria tenuissima 3aDNA 3aPrunus triloba 3abeak 3abeautification 3acolor 3aconidia 3aconidiophores 3aculture media 3adefoliation 3adisease control 3adisease transmission 3aecology 3aethanol 3afungi 3aglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 3ahistones 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3alandscapes 3aleaf spot 3aleaves 3amycelium 3aolives 3apathogenicity 3apathogens 3apolygalacturonase 3asequence analysis 3ashrubs 3aChina 0aAmygdalus triloba1 aHe, Y.

Afonso I (First Portuguese King), displayed several signs of distinctive biodeterioration patterns. According to the ICOMOS Illustrated glossary on stone deterioration patterns, these could be characterized as visual mould proliferation, presence of black crusts, stone erosion and disintegration. Due to the invaluable nature of this monument, a multi-disciplinary approach (biological and analytical) to fully characterize these phenomena was applied. The results obtained allowed the characterization of the fungal diversity colonizing this monument, as well as the identification of various deterioration products. The results highlighted that the detected indoor black crusts displayed various characteristics from polluted environments, although lacking the typical association with gypsum. The black crusts were also characterized by the presence of lead oxides, damaging salts and carbonaceous particles. In addition, it could be verified that the erosion phenomena found are a result from fungal mediated calcium carbonate dissolution and calcium oxalate formation. The establishment of different fungal populations coupled with the deposition of environmental particles contributed to the development of the distinct phenomena detected through differential biodeterioration mechanisms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUnited Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization 3abiodegradation 3acalcium carbonate 3acalcium oxalate 3afungi 3agypsum 3alead 3alimestone 3amonuments 3aPortugal 0aBlack crusts 0aIndoor environments 0aBiodeterioration1 aGil, Francisco1 aCatarino, Lídia,1 aSoares, Fabiana1 aTiago, Igor1 aPortugal, António0 tInternational biodeterioration & biodegradation.g2020 Apr., v. 149 p.104933-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12418x0964-83057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ibiod.2020.1049333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02430naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245006300170520126100233592002801494650001901522650002101541650001101562650001201573650001101585650002901596650001501625650002301640650002101663650001701684651001201701653001901713653002601732653002401758700001901782700002301801773011301824856008601937852000902023655001202032IND60687940820221119025119.0200523e20200801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068794082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1213262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMuñoz, Pablo,14aThe impact of urbanization on Austria’s carbon footprint  aUrbanization is one of the factors contributing globally to greenhouse gas emissions. Its impact however is not homogeneous across countries. Some studies show that urban populations have a higher carbon footprint due to higher consumption levels, whereas other research suggests that higher population density decreases energy demands and the associated emissions. Due to the importance of collecting in-depth evidence for countries and regions on a case-by-case basis, this article investigates the impact of urbanization on carbon dioxide emissions for Austria as supporting empirical evidence for a high-income economy. The study particularly unpacks profiles of carbon footprints for more than 8000 households located according to three different levels of urbanization: urban, semi-urban and rural. Findings reveal that urban residents in Austria have the lowest Carbon Footprint (CF) of the three groups; this is followed by rural and then semi-urban residents. Overall, the study highlights that urbanization in Austria may represent a relative reduction of emissions in the future due to more compact cities, which should be considered along with other drivers of greenhouse gas emissions in order to achieve national and European climate targets.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon footprint 3acities 3aclimate 3aenergy 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3ahouseholds 3apopulation density 3aurban population 3aurbanization 3aAustria 0aClimate change 0aInput-output analysis 0aEmission inequality1 aZwick, Sabrina1 aMirzabaev, Alisher0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2020 Aug. 01, v. 263 p.121326-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1213263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03475naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005800148245013800206300001600344500001900360520172300379592002802102596010602130650002502236650002002261650002302281650001102304650001302315650001302328650002102341650001402362650001802376650001402394650002402408651001102432653002202443653001602465653001802481653003002499653002602529653002502555653001802580653001602598700001602614700001902630700002002649700002102669700002202690773013002712856008202842852000902924655001202933IND60732293320221117224348.0210326e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073229332DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS-06-20-1260-RE2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTaparia, Tanvi1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6300-412X10aComparative Studies on the Disease Prevalence and Population Dynamics of Ginger Blotch and Brown Blotch Pathogens of Button Mushrooms  ap. 542-547.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aBacterial blotch is one of the most economically important diseases of button 'mushroom. Knowledge of mechanisms of disease expression, inoculum thresholds, and disease management is limited to the most well-known pathogen, Pseudomonas tolaasii. Recent outbreaks in Europe have been attributed to ‘P. gingeri’ and P. salomonii for ginger and brown blotch, respectively. Information about their identity, infection dynamics, and pathogenicity is largely lacking. The disease pressure in an experimental mushroom cultivation facility was evaluated for ‘P. gingeri’ and P. salomonii over varying inoculation densities, casing soil types, environmental humidity, and cultivation cycles. The pathogen population structures in the casing soils were simultaneously tracked across the cropping cycle using highly specific and sensitive TaqMan-quantitative PCR assays. ‘P. gingeri’ caused disease outbreaks at lower inoculum thresholds (10⁴ CFU/g) in the soil than P. salomonii (10⁵ CFU/g). Ginger blotch generically declined in later harvest cycles, although brown blotch did not. Casing soils were differentially suppressive to blotch diseases, based on their composition and supplementation. Endemic pathogen populations increased across the cultivation cycle although the inoculated pathogen populations were consistent between the first and second flush. In conclusion, ‘P. gingeri’ and P. salomonii have unique infection and population dynamics that vary over soil types. Their endemic populations are also differently abundant in peat-based casing soils. This knowledge is essential for interpreting diagnostic results from screening mushroom farms and designing localized disease control strategies.  aPublisher supplied data  aKV1509-050cTopsector Horticulture and propagation material of the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs 3aPseudomonas tolaasii 3adisease control 3adisease prevalence 3aginger 3ahumidity 3ainoculum 3amushroom growing 3amushrooms 3apathogenicity 3apathogens 3apopulation dynamics 3aEurope 0aAgaricus bisporus 0acasing soil 0adose response 0aPseudomonas ‘gingeri’ 0aPseudomonas salomonii 0asoil-borne pathogens 0asoil inoculum 0aTaqMan-qPCR1 aHendrix, Ed1 aHendriks, Marc1 aKrijger, Marjon1 aBoer, Wietse de,1 avan der Wolf, Jan0 tPlant disease.g2021 Mar., v. 105, no. 3 p.542-547dThe American Phytopathological SocietywJournal:jnl30858x0191-29177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS-06-20-1260-RE3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02946naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245018500173520159300358592002801951650002001979650001201999650002702011650001302038650001502051650001102066650001902077650002102096650001502117650002502132653000902157653002102166653002502187653002602212653001902238700002302257700001802280700001802298773011302316856008602429852000902515655001202524IND60687940920221119025248.0200809e20200720xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068794092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1213282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYadav, Dharmender10aEnsuring sustainability of conventional aerobic wastewater treatment system via bio-augmentation of aerobic bacterial consortium: An enhanced biological phosphorus removal approach  aEnhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR) is an inevitable need of sustainable waste water treatment systems (WWTS). In this regard, this study aimed to investigate the potential of an aerobic continuously stirred tank reactor (CSTR), enriched with selected bacterial consortium, for enhanced phosphorus removal. The CSTR biomass was bioaugmented through addition of 12 distinct phosphorus accumulating and solubilizing strains. The medium and high strength synthetic waste water, having the phosphorus concentration in the range of 1.4–40 mg/L, was fed to the CSTR throughout this study. With respect to medium strength feed, total phosphorus (TP) removal efficiency reached up to 90% at an influent concentration of 20 mg/L, followed by a declining trend of removal efficiency as 62 and 30%, at the TP concentration of 30 and 40 mg/L, respectively. Contrary, the EBPR activity was observed to be inhibiting (lesser accumulation of phosphorus in biomass) at lower influent TP value of 10 mg/L, when the CSTR was operated with high strength waste water. Further, ammonical nitrogen and chemical oxygen demand removal performance of the system was observed to be independent of influent TP concentration. Detailed experimental investigations revealed that the inoculated bacterial consortium favored the transformation and storage of influent TP into intracellular storage of polyphosphate (poly-P). Overall, the results indicated that the sustainability of existing WWTS can be ensured through bioaugmentation of non-EBPR sludge to aerobically cultivated EBPR performing sludge.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioaugmentation 3abiomass 3achemical oxygen demand 3anitrogen 3aphosphorus 3asludge 3asolubilization 3atotal phosphorus 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 0aEBPR 0aBio-augmentation 0aBacterial consortium 0aWaste water treatment 0aSustainability1 aSingh, Nitin Kumar1 aPruthi, Vikas1 aKumar, Pramod0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2020 July 20, v. 262 p.121328-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1213283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02788naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005800147245013700205506011700342506007600459520104000535592002801575506003701603650001701640650001601657650002101673650001301694650001201707650001801719650002501737650002901762650002301791650001801814650001301832653002001845653003101865653003201896653002401928653001801952700002301970700005901993700002302052700002202075773011802097856008202215852000902297655001202306IND60767281520221207122607.0220809e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076728152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.eti.2022.1024152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBruni, Cecilia1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9324-000810aLessons learnt from different inoculation strategies for pilot-scale start-up of partial nitritation for landfill leachate treatment  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aConventional biological processes are not enough to achieve desired removal efficiencies from N-rich waste streams such as landfill leachate. In this aspect, start-up phase of a sequencing batch reactor was monitored that treated landfill leachate through a nitritation (LPN) process. The reactor was inoculated from two different sources with distinctive microbial compositions. The acclimatized sludge, taken from a leachate intermittent aeration reactor, failed to establish nitritation but instead developed a nitrification process initially (N-NO₃ > 500 mg/l and N-NO₂ almost null) and showed no biological activity afterwards. The latter non-acclimatized sludge taken from a conventional activated sludge (CAS) reactor achieved N-NH₄ removal up to 96%. Although the nitrite oxidizing genus Nitrospira was abundant in the CAS, it was not further detected in the LPN system. Moreover, the enrichment of ammonia oxidizing genus Nitrosomonas in the LPN was consistent with the establishment of an efficient nitritation process.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aNitrosomonas 3aacclimation 3aactivated sludge 3aaeration 3aammonia 3abatch systems 3abioactive properties 3aenvironmental technology 3alandfill leachates 3anitrification 3anitrites 0aAcclimatization 0aHigh-throughput sequencing 0aLandfill leachate treatment 0aMicrobial community 0aNitrite route1 aCipolletta, Giulia1 aAkyol, Çağrı1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9907-66161 aEusebi, Anna Laura1 aFatone, Francesco0 tEnvironmental technology & innovation.g2022 Aug., v. 27 p.102415-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23259x2352-18647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eti.2022.1024153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02154naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245016900166300001800335520066400353592002801017650001201045650001301057650001301070650001201083650001101095650002101106650002601127650001601153650001801169650002201187653001601209653001301225653000801238653001301246653002201259653001401281700002601295700002401321700002301345700002101368700002401389700003401413700001901447773010301466856008201569852000901651655001201660IND60635792420221122051024.0190509e20190503xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063579242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2019.03.0392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSvětlík, Jan10aCerium(IV) based oxidative free radical cyclization of active methylene compounds with some cyclic alkenes: A useful annulation method for terpene functionalization  ap. 2652-2663.  aCeric ammonium nitrate-mediated oxidative cyclizations of CH-acids with terpenes and terpene like substrates were investigated.

Whereas standard SSAs are done by inoculating small incisions in stems, we cut off stems (4 to 5 mm diameter), inoculated the cut ends with discs of Cryphonectria parasitica inoculum, and covered them with plastic sleeves. This method was designed to be simple to implement, to consistently induce cankering, and to better enable seedlings to recover by developing shoots from the lower stem (standard SSAs delay removal of blighted stems until late in the growing season, if at all). We conducted six experiments with seedlings and orchard trees of Castanea dentata (susceptible), Castanea mollissima (resistant), and hybrids expected to vary in resistance. Experiments with seedlings and two of the three orchard experiments showed clear differentiation between susceptible and resistant types, especially >90 days postinoculation and when the orange-colored zone of the canker was measured. One orchard experiment failed to give clear results but was ended earlier (60 days) than the other experiments. We observed only two failed inoculations out of >200 performed. Comparisons with other studies suggest that this SSA method performs at least as well as the standard SSA method in distinguishing resistant and susceptible types, at least in seedlings. Survivorship after 1 year for seedlings inoculated in 2018 ranged from 70% for C. dentata to 100% for C. mollissima, and in 2019 they ranged from 40% in hybrids to 100% for C. mollissima. Deaths of seedlings after SSAs were mostly unrelated to the inoculations (e.g., root rot).  aPublisher supplied data  cBerry College’s Student Work Education Program  cGeorgia Chapter of TACF 3aCastanea dentata 3aCastanea mollissima 3aCryphonectria parasitica 3ablight 3ahybrids 3ainoculum 3aorchards 3aroot rot 3asurvival rate 0acanker 0aCastanea 0achestnut 0afungi 0aresistance breeding 0asmall stem assay 0aUnited States1 aMoss, John Patten1 aWalker, William1 aBailey, Natalie1 aFoster, Cooper1 aReece, Hali1 aJennings, Caroline0 tPlant disease.g2021 Mar., v. 105, no. 3 p.576-584dThe American Phytopathological SocietywJournal:jnl30858x0191-29177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS-06-20-1272-RE3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03010naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003200150245011700182300001600299520140600315592002801721650002101749650001701770650002201787650002401809650001401833650001901847650001301866650001401879650002001893650002201913651001201935653003401947653001701981653002001998653001802018653002602036653001602062700002502078700002002103700002102123700002202144700002202166700001802188700001902206700002102225700002402246773011602270856008502386852000902471655001202480IND50060526520221119010324.0190403e20130201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006052652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2012.10.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNavarro-Cerrillo, Rafael M.10aStructure and spatio-temporal dynamics of cedar forests along a management gradient in the Middle Atlas, Morocco  ap. 341-353.  aDiameter distribution and temporal and spatial patterns of a Cedrus atlantica forest were studied across a management gradient (undisturbed, logged and highly disturbed) in Ifrane National Park, Morocco. Forest structure and regeneration dynamics showed significant differences among management levels. The diameter distribution in undisturbed and logged stands indicated the presence of few young individuals, and a poor regeneration status in highly disturbed stands. Variance in diameter was larger in natural stands compared to managed ones. There was a seedling establishment pulse during the time period between 1910 and 1990 at three sites, but a lack of sapling and juveniles occurred at undisturbed and logged forests in the last century, which might be attributed to competition between C. atlantica and Quercus ilex. Nevertheless, cedar trees persistently recruited to all forests during the last 50years, but cedar density was significantly higher in the highly disturbed forest areas. Spatial analysis shows a general trend toward aggregation for all species involved. This pattern was observed among C. atlantica trees in undisturbed and highly disturbed stands but was not significant in logged stands. Differences in management may promote variation in stand structure and regeneration dynamics of the subalpine cedar forests along the management gradient in the Middle Atlas, Morocco.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCedrus atlantica 3aQuercus ilex 3aforest management 3aforest regeneration 3ajuveniles 3anational parks 3asaplings 3aseedlings 3astand structure 3asubalpine forests 3aMorocco 0aSustainable forest management 0aRegeneration 0aStand structure 0aAge structure 0aRegeneration dynamics 0aAtlas cedar1 aManzanedo, Rubén D.1 aBohorque, Julia1 aSánchez, Raúl,1 aSánchez, Javier,1 aMiguel, Sergio de1 aSolano, David1 aQarro, Mohamed1 aGriffith, Daniel1 aPalacios, Guillermo0 tForest ecology and management.g2013 Feb. 01, v. 289 p.341-353dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2012.10.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02340naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002500152245016500177300001800342520106500360592002801425650002601453650004801479650002801527650001401555650002101569650001201590650001801602650001401620650001901634650001401653650001501667650002401682700002401706700002301730773013701753856005501890852000901945655001201954IND4468044520221116220712.0120727e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446804452DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2621.2011.02739.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCorbo, Maria Rosaria10aShelf life of alginate beads containing lactobacilli and bifidobacteria: characterisation of microspheres containing Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus  ap. 2212-2217.  aCapsules, containing different microorganisms (Lactobacillus plantarum, L. casei, L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, L. delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii, L. reuteri, L. rhamnosus, Bifidobacterium breve and B. animalis subsp. lactis), were produced through a simple extrusion protocol and dipped in a CaCl2 solution (0.5% or 8%).

As a result of cooperation, businesses gain economic, environmental, and social benefits. Especially in recent years, IS applications have become widespread due to the problems experienced in the supply of resources. The presence of more than one enterprise in cooperation creates a complex network structure in IS applications. In this complex system, many decision problems are encountered in establishing and effectively maintaining the industrial symbiosis network. Operations research techniques are at the forefront of the methods used to solve decision problems. This study examined studies using operations research techniques in industrial symbiosis. Studies were divided into four classes according to the methods they used: exact methods, heuristic methods, multi-criteria decision-making, and simulation. In the literature review, the studies in the Web of Science (WOS) database are systematically presented by scanning with the determined keywords. As a result of the study, it was analyzed which method was preferred and where the methods could be applied in industrial symbiosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3abusiness enterprises 3adatabases 3aenergy 3aindustrial symbiosis 3amulti-criteria decision making 3apollution 3aresearch1 aAlakaş, Hacı Mehmet1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9874-75881 aEren, Tamer0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2022 Oct., v. 29, no. 47 p.70658-70673dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-022-22507-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02848naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245020000167300001400367520128100381592002801662650001701690650001201707650002201719650001901741650001601760650002801776650001501804650001601819650001501835650002101850650002701871653002601898653001701924653003301941653003301974653002002007653001302027700001602040700001602056700001702072700001802089700001902107700001902126773011402145856008602259852000902345655001202354IND60591991720221120063945.0190321e20180401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059199172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jchromb.2018.02.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Yiying10aLC-MS/MS method for the determination of the prodrug aripiprazole lauroxil and its three metabolites in plasma and its application to in vitro biotransformation and animal pharmacokinetic studies  ap. 67-75.  aA sensitive and selective LC-MS/MS method for determination of the prodrug aripiprazole lauroxil (AL) and the three metabolites (N-hydroxymethyl aripiprazole [NHA], aripiprazole [ARP], and dehydro aripiprazole [DHA]) in plasma was developed using ARP-d8 as an internal standard. The analytes were determined on an AB Sciex Triple Quad™ 4500 system using positive ion electrospray ionization and selected multiple reaction monitoring mode. Solid phase extraction was applied for sample preparation for AL, ARP, and DHA, and protein precipitation for NHA. Chromatographic separation was performed on an Agilent Eclipse XDB-CN column (100 × 2.1 mm i.d., 3.5 μm) using the mobile phase of water and acetonitrile (25:75, v/v) containing 0.1% formic acid with a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min. The linear ranges for AL, NHA, ARP, and DHA were 0.5–50 ng/mL, 1.0–50 ng/mL, 0.5–50 ng/mL, and 0.05–5.0 ng/mL, respectively. The average recovery in the plasma sample was stable and reproducible. The precision and accuracy of the intra- and inter-run were within assay variability criteria limits. The developed method was suitable for in vitro biotransformation studies in plasma and animal pharmacokinetic studies after intramuscular injection of AL formulations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetonitrile 3aanimals 3abiotransformation 3achromatography 3aformic acid 3aintramuscular injection 3aionization 3ametabolites 3amonitoring 3apharmacokinetics 3asolid phase extraction 0aAripiprazole lauroxil 0aAripiprazole 0aN-hydroxymethyl aripiprazole 0aDehydro aripiprazole prodrug 0aPharmacokinetic 0aLC-MS/MS1 aLu, Xiaoyan1 aGai, Yunyun1 aSha, Chunjie1 aLeng, Guangyi1 aYang, Xiucheng1 aBayuechang'an,0 tJournal of chromatography.g2018 Apr. 01, v. 1081-1082 p.67-75dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12459x1570-02327nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jchromb.2018.02.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03108naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245006300166300001000229500001900239520191700258592002802175650001702203650001102220650001002231650001702241650001402258650002502272650001402297650001102311650001002322650001302332650001202345700001902357700001702376700001702393700002002410700005902430773010602489856008202595852000902677655001202686IND60712635920221116193141.0210731e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071263592DNAL7 a10.1186/s12985-020-1279-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBlahak, Silvia10aInvestigations into the presence of nidoviruses in pythons  ap. 6.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aBACKGROUND: Pneumonia and stomatitis represent severe and often fatal diseases in different captive snakes. Apart from bacterial infections, paramyxo-, adeno-, reo- and arenaviruses cause these diseases. In 2014, new viruses emerged as the cause of pneumonia in pythons. In a few publications, nidoviruses have been reported in association with pneumonia in ball pythons and a tiger python. The viruses were found using new sequencing methods from the organ tissue of dead animals. METHODS: Severe pneumonia and stomatitis resulted in a high mortality rate in a captive breeding collection of green tree pythons. Unbiased deep sequencing lead to the detection of nidoviral sequences. A developed RT-qPCR was used to confirm the metagenome results and to determine the importance of this virus. A total of 1554 different boid snakes, including animals suffering from respiratory diseases as well as healthy controls, were screened for nidoviruses. Furthermore, in addition to two full-length sequences, partial sequences were generated from different snake species. RESULTS: The assembled full-length snake nidovirus genomes share only an overall genome sequence identity of less than 66.9% to other published snake nidoviruses and new partial sequences vary between 99.89 and 79.4%. Highest viral loads were detected in lung samples. The snake nidovirus was not only present in diseased animals, but also in snakes showing no typical clinical signs. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings further highlight the possible importance of snake nidoviruses in respiratory diseases and proof multiple circulating strains with varying disease potential. Nidovirus detection in clinical healthy individuals might represent testing during the incubation period or reconvalescence. Our investigations show new aspects of nidovirus infections in pythons. Nidoviruses should be included in routine diagnostic workup of diseased reptiles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArenaviridae 3agenome 3alungs 3ametagenomics 3amortality 3anucleotide sequences 3apneumonia 3asnakes 3atrees 3avirology 3aviruses1 aJenckel, Maria1 aHöper, Dirk1 aBeer, Martin1 aHoffmann, Bernd1 aSchlottau, Kore1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3999-03930 tVirology journal.g2020 Dec., v. 17, no. 1 p.6-6dBioMed CentralwJournal:J000001738x1743-422X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12985-020-1279-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02424naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005600148245013800204300001600342520109500358592002801453650001101481650002801492650002101520650001401541650001301555650000901568650001201577650002201589650001101611653001901622653001101641653001301652653002001665653002601685700001401711700001701725700001501742700001701757773012501774856008201899852000901981655001201990IND60628891120221119125518.0190131e20180815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062889112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2018.03.1002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWei, Huaixin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2372-915510aRational synthesis of graphene-encapsulated uniform MnMoO4 hollow spheres as long-life and high-rate anodes for lithium-ion batteries  ap. 256-262.  aIn this manuscript, the graphene-encapsulated MnMoO4 hollow spheres (MnMoO4@G) synthesized by an effective strategy were reported. Benefiting from the intriguing hybrid architecture of hollow structure and conductive graphene network, the MnMoO4@G composite displays superior electrochemical performance with high specific capacity of 1142 mA h g−1, high reversible cycling stability of 921 mA h g−1 at a current density of 100 mA g-1 after 70 cycles, and stable rate performance (around 513 mA h g−1 at a current density of 4.0 A g−1). The remarkable battery performance can be attributed to the rational design of the architecture, which not only ensures the fast transport of electrons and lithium ions within the electrode material, but also effectively relax the stress induced by the insertion/extraction of lithium ions. This facile synthetic method can extend to other transition metal oxides with large volume excursions and poor electric conductivity and promotes the development of transition metal oxides as high-performance LIB anode material.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanodes 3aelectrical conductivity 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrons 3agraphene 3aions 3alithium 3alithium batteries 3aoxides 0aHollow spheres 0aMnMoO4 0aGraphene 0aAnode materials 0aLithium-ion batteries1 aYang, Jun1 aZhang, Yufei1 aQian, Yong1 aGeng, Hongbo0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2018 Aug. 15, v. 524 p.256-262dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2018.03.1003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02919naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006300148245015600211300002000367500001100387520147900398592002801877596007001905650001101975650003301986650001802019650001902037650002202056650001302078650001302091650002102104650002602125650001502151650002002166700002002186700001802206700003802224773015502262856008302417852000902500655001202509IND60794805520221117223226.0220929e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079480552DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-022-22749-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHaruna, Abdurrashid1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0410-101510aPreparation and modification methods of defective titanium dioxide-based nanoparticles for photocatalytic wastewater treatment—a comprehensive review  ap. 70706-70745.  aReview  aThe rapid population growth and industrial expansion worldwide have created serious water contamination concerns. To curb the pollution issue, it has become imperative to use a versatile material for the treatment. Titanium dioxide (TiO₂) has been recognized as the most-studied nanoparticle in various fields of science and engineering due to its availability, low cost, efficiency, and other fascinating properties with a wide range of applications in modern technology. Recent studies revealed the photocatalytic activity of the material for the treatment of industrial effluents to promote environmental sustainability. With the wide band gap energy of 3.2 eV, TiO₂ can be activated under UV light; thus, many strategies have been proposed to extend its photoabsorption to the visible light region. In what follows, this has generated increasing attention to study its characteristics and structural modifications in different forms for photocatalytic applications. The present review provides an insight into the understanding of the synthesis methods of TiO₂, the current progress in the treatment techniques for the degradation of wide environmental pollutants employing modified TiO₂ nanoparticles, and the factors affecting its photocatalytic activities. Further, recent developments in using titania for practical applications, the approach for designing novel nanomaterials, and the prospects and opportunities in this exciting area have been discussed.  aPublisher supplied data  aFRGS/1/2020/STG05/UTP/02/2cMinistry of Higher Education Malaysia 3aenergy 3aenvironmental sustainability 3ananoparticles 3aphotocatalysis 3apopulation growth 3aresearch 3atitanium 3atitanium dioxide 3aultraviolet radiation 3awastewater 3awater pollution1 aChong, Fai-Kait1 aHo, Yeek-Chia1 aMerican, Zulkifli Merican Aljunid0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2022 Oct., v. 29, no. 47 p.70706-70745dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-022-22749-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01719naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245015900166300001800325520036800343592002800711650002300739650002300762650002300785650002300808650002200831650001100853653002700864653002500891653004800916653002100964653002000985700001901005700001801024700001201042700001701054700001701071700001501088773010301103856008201206852000901288655001201297IND60635792920221122051144.0190509e20190503xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063579292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2019.03.0452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFang, Guosheng10aAsymmetric cyclizations via a sequential Michael addition/Conia-ene reaction by combining multifunctional quaternary phosphonium salt and silver catalysis  ap. 2706-2716.  aA one-pot asymmetric Michael addition/Conia-ene reaction sequence, catalyzed by combination of a dipeptide-derived multifunctional quaternary phosphonium salt and Ag2CO3 has been developed, which provides a series of synthetically important chiral methylenecyclopentane derivatives in moderate to excellent yields (up to 97%) and enantioselectivities (up to 93%).  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalytic activity 3achemical reactions 3achemical structure 3aenantioselectivity 3aorganic compounds 3asilver 0aAsymmetric cyclization 0aSequential catalysis 0aMultifunctional quaternary phosphonium salt 0aSilver catalysis 0aChiral ion pair1 aZheng, Changwu1 aCao, Dongdong1 aPan, Lu1 aHong, Haoran1 aWang, Hongyu1 aZhao, Gang0 tTetrahedron.g2019 May 03, v. 75, no. 18 p.2706-2716dElsevier LtdwJournal:11744x0040-40207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tet.2019.03.0453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02968naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245010100164300001600265500001900281520140100300592002801701596006801729650002601797650001501823650001401838650002001852650001401872650001501886650001001901650001401911650001501925650001101940650001401951651001101965651000901976651001401985651001101999653001402010653000902024653002102033653002402054700002002078700001802098700002302116700002102139700005702160773013002217856008202347852000902429655001202438IND60732293820221117224106.0210326e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073229382DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS-06-20-1325-RE2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIjaz, Usman10aPathogenic Specialization in Uromyces viciae-fabae in Australia and Rust Resistance in Faba Bean  ap. 636-642.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe pathogen Uromyces viciae-fabae causes rust (a fungal disease) on faba bean (Vicia faba). This disease limits faba bean production in Africa, Asia, Europe, and Australia. The development of resistant cultivars to U. viciae-fabae is the optimal solution for sustainable disease management. However, unknown virulence in Australian U. viciae-fabae populations has confounded resistance breeding. This study examined differences in virulence among Australian U. viciae-fabae isolates collected from various locations and established a differential set of faba bean genotypes. Ten rust isolates were collected from the major faba bean growing regions in Australia and single spore cultures produced. These cultures were subsequently used for assessing virulence on 40 diverse faba bean genotypes. Based on the host-pathogen interactions, 12 putative host genotypes were identified as a differential set. A nomenclature system was subsequently developed using the binary pathotype naming system. Based upon host-pathogen interactions, nine virulence patterns were detected, and the isolates were named using the new nomenclature. We report characterization and naming of U. viciae-fabae pathotypes using differential genotypes in Australia. This differential set will help identify and track the evolution of new virulence in pathogen population and will assist pyramiding of rust resistance genes.  aPublisher supplied data  aUA000163aUS000163cGrains Research and Development Corporation 3aUromyces viciae-fabae 3aVicia faba 3acultivars 3adisease control 3aevolution 3afaba beans 3afungi 3apathogens 3apathotypes 3aspores 3avirulence 3aAfrica 3aAsia 3aAustralia 3aEurope 0afaba bean 0arust 0apathotype survey 0abinary nomenclature1 aAdhikari, Kedar1 aKimber, Rohan1 aTrethowan, Richard1 aBariana, Harbans1 aBansal, Urmil1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1119-44640 tPlant disease.g2021 Mar., v. 105, no. 3 p.636-642dThe American Phytopathological SocietywJournal:jnl30858x0191-29177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS-06-20-1325-RE3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02769naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245011800167300002000285500001100305520124700316592002801563650001601591650002701607650001301634650002001647650001801667650001801685650001801703650001701721650001401738650001301752650001901765650002101784700001901805700001801824700001901842700001801861700003501879700002101914700002601935700001701961700006201978773015502040856008302195852000902278655001202287IND60794805720221117223236.0220929e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079480572DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-022-22779-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAfsheen, Nadia10aNeurotoxic effects of environmental contaminants—measurements, mechanistic insight, and environmental relevance  ap. 70808-70821.  aReview  aPollution is a significant and growing concern for any population regardless of age because these environmental contaminants exhibit different neurodegenerative effects on persons of different ages. These environmental contaminants are the products of human welfare projects like industry, automobile exhaust, clinical and research laboratory extrudes, and agricultural chemicals. These contaminants are found in various forms in environmental matrices like nanoparticles, particulate matter, lipophilic vaporized toxicants, and ultrafine particulate matter. Because of their small size, they can easily cross blood–brain barriers or use different cellular mechanisms for assistance. Other than this, these contaminants cause an innate immune response in different cells of the central nervous system and cause neurotoxicity. Considering the above critiques and current needs, this review summarizes different protective strategies based on bioactive compounds present in plants. Various bioactive compounds from medicinal plants with neuroprotective capacities are discussed with relevant examples. Many in vitro studies on clinical trials have shown promising outcomes using plant-based bioactive compounds against neurological disorders.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautomobiles 3acentral nervous system 3aindustry 3ainnate immunity 3alipophilicity 3ananoparticles 3aneurotoxicity 3aparticulates 3apollution 3aresearch 3asocial welfare 3atoxic substances1 aRafique, Sadia1 aRafeeq, Hamza1 aIrshad, Kanwal1 aHussain, Asim1 aBuk̲h̲ārī, Ẓill-i Humā,1 aWinīta Kumāra,1 aVēlāyutan̲, T.

The lack of high-performance semiconductor support remains a challenge for the harvesting and conversion of solar energy. Here, we report the syntheses of two dimensional (2D) BiOBr nanosheets with the superiorities of suitable band gaps, nontoxic, corrosion resistant and so on. These features enable them unprecedented performance for acting as the visible-light-driven support towards alcohol oxidation. Firstly, the pure BiOBr nanosheet has negligible activity towards alcohol oxidation. After the deposition of Pt nanoparticles (NPs), the as-prepared Pt-BiOBr composites show superior electrocatalytic activities towards ethanol and methanol oxidation reaction under visible light irradiation, with the mass activities of 929.8 mA mg−1Pt and 751.7 mA mg−1Pt, 6.0 and 28.4-fold enhancements than those under dark condition, respectively. The great enhancement in the photoelectrocatalytic performances can be attributed to the unique 2D nanostructure, synergistic and photocatalytic effects. This work may pave up a new route for designing the desirable semiconductor supports for the decoration of the noble metal catalysts, showing significant promise for the application of fuel cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3acorrosion 3aethanol 3afuel cells 3aharvesting 3airradiation 3amethanol 3ananocomposites 3ananoparticles 3ananosheets 3aoxidation 3aphotocatalysis 3asemiconductors 3asolar energy 0aTwo dimensional 0aBiOBr 0aVisible light 0aPhotoelectrocatalyst 0aAlcohol oxidation reaction1 aZhai, Chunyang1 aYu, Chaokai1 aZeng, Lixi1 aLiu, Zhao-Qing1 aZhu, Mingshan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5926-53830 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2018 Aug. 15, v. 524 p.195-203dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2018.03.1043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02295naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147100001900165245006200184300001600246500001500262520063600277592002800913650001700941650002200958650001000980650001600990650001701006650001801023650001901041650001601060650001201076650002401088650003401112650005201146650004101198650002701239650001101266650002901277650001001306650002701316650002801343650002801371650002901399651001801428651001801446653000901464653003501473653000901508773013201517852000901649856008301658655001201741IND4372765020221116221047.0181016e200507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437276502DNAL7 a161310032pmid7 a10.1177/1040638705017004182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRadi, Zaher A.10aEndometritis and Cystic Endometrial Hyperplasia in a Goat  ap. 393-395.  a2019-12-04  aHistologic examination was performed on uterine biopsy samples of irregular cystic masses noted during caesarean section of a 2-year-old female Boer goat.

In this study, hydrothermal precipitation for synthesizing versatile nanostructured zinc oxide particles (nZnOs), including nanorods (1D), nanoplatelets (2D), and multibranched flower-like particles (3D), was achieved by controlling pH values of source precursors and growth time. Hydrothermal synthesis is an eco-friendly process without the requirement of hazardous organic solvents. The antimicrobial properties of these nZnO particles were evaluated on different soil-borne plant pathogens. These pathogens are serious limiting factors in agriculture. Results indicate that multibranched flower-like ZnO (3D nZnO) showed more remarkable, reliable, and stable antifungal activity compared with other nZnOs. The scanning electron microscopy results also demonstrated significant mechanical damage to pathogens that caused by the branches of flower-like particles from 3D nZnO. Moreover, results of photodegradation and environmental resistance of the synthesized nZnOs revealed their potentials to reduce hazardous chemical pesticides and the eco-friendliness. This work is the first to compare the antimicrobial (i.e., antifungal) properties of various nZnOs and their applications in agriculture. Our results suggest that multibranched flower-like ZnO can be served as promising candidates of green antimicrobials with multiple modes of action in sustainable agriculture.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural productivity 3aanti-infective agents 3aantifungal properties 3amechanical damage 3amechanism of action 3ananorods 3apH 3apesticides 3aphotolysis 3aplant pathogens 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asolvents 3asustainable agriculture 3azinc oxide 0aZnO 0aHydrothermal synthesis 0aMultibranched 0aAntimicrobial 0aAgriculture1 aLu, Ying-Chun1 aYang, Min-Jung1 aHuang, Jenn Wen,1 aLinda Chang, Pi-Fang1 aHsueh, Han-Yu0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2020 July 20, v. 262 p.121342-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1213423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02429naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245008900165300001600254520124900270592002801519650001601547650000901563650001201572650002001584650000701604650001201611650001301623650001401636653003201650653002301682653002701705700001601732700001601748700006101764773012801825856008101953852000902034655001202043IND60540114420221122000234.0190318e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054011442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2015.07.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Dongjun14aThe effect of apple cider characteristics and membrane pore size on membrane fouling  ap. 974-979.  aMicrofiltration (MF) of apple cider using four membrane pore sizes was investigated. MF with 0.2 and 0.45 μm pore sizes, and with 0.8 and 1.4 μm pore sizes, respectively, resulted in similar flux behavior and MF juice characteristics. Clear juice was obtained using all four pore sizes. MF did not cause any significant changes in pH and °Brix, regardless of pore size. Viscosity of the MF juice was lower than of the unfiltered apple cider for all membranes, but the viscosity decrease was the largest for the 0.2 and 0.45 μm membranes, due to the low transmission of pectin into the MF juice. Pectin transmission was 3–9% of the initial pectin content for the 0.2 μm membrane, 6–51% for the 0.45 μm. 45–100% for the 0.8 μm, and 60–100% for the 1.4 μm membrane. Apple cider haze particles that were smaller or of size comparable with the membrane pore size were deemed responsible for fouling, while particles much larger than the pores did not have a significant contribution to fouling. The fouling of 0.2 μm and 0.45 μm membranes was dominated by cake layer formation (external fouling), while fouling of the 0.8 μm and 1.4 μm membranes was dominated by pore constriction and pore blocking (internal fouling).  aPublisher supplied data 3aapple cider 3abrix 3afouling 3amicrofiltration 3apH 3apectins 3aporosity 3aviscosity 0aApple cider microfiltration 0aFouling mechanisms 0aCritical particle size1 aLau, Evonne1 aHuang, Shan1 aMoraru, Carmen I.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8307-71230 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2015 Dec., v. 64, no. 2 p.974-979dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2015.07.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01888naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245007500164300001800239520078000257592002801037650001501065650001601080650002101096650002301117650001101140650002801151653003001179653001601209653001701225653001401242653001901256700002201275700002301297773010301320856008201423852000901505655001201514IND60635793220221122051154.0190509e20190503xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063579322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2019.03.0482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMurata, Yumi14aThe synthetic protocol for α-bromocarbonyl compounds via brominations  ap. 2726-2736.  aα-Bromocarbonyl compound easily generates α-radicals in the presence of a proper initiator, such as copper salt. Recently, tertiary-alkylation reaction using α-bromocarbonyl compound as a tertiary alkyl source is recognized as one of the most important alkylation reactions. The reactions using α-bromocarbonyl compound are increasing, whereas synthetic methods for various functionalized α-bromocarbonyl compounds are not summarized. Generally, α-bromocarbonyl compounds can be synthesized from the corresponding carboxylic acids via α-bromo acid bromide, but the brominations of carboxylic acids are sometimes problematic. In this paper, we will report some technical information for a bromination and synthetic examples of representative α-bromocarbonyl compounds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkylation 3abromination 3acarboxylic acids 3achemical structure 3acopper 3aorganobromine compounds 0aα-Bromocarbonyl compound 0aBromination 0aCondensation 0aAmidation 0aEsterification1 aTakeuchi, Kentaro1 aNishikata, Takashi0 tTetrahedron.g2019 May 03, v. 75, no. 18 p.2726-2736dElsevier LtdwJournal:11744x0040-40207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tet.2019.03.0483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01219naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245010900162300001200271520019200283592002800475650002000503650001300523650001200536650000900548650002300557700001800580700001700598700001800615700002100633700001800654773012600672856007400798852000900872655001200881IND60663934020221119110104.0190910e20141222xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066393402DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ib90045f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBhardwaj, Nandana10aCorrection: Silk fibroin–keratin based 3D scaffolds as a dermal substitute for skin tissue engineering  ap. 142.  aCorrection for ‘Silk fibroin–keratin based 3D scaffolds as a dermal substitute for skin tissue engineering’ by Nandana Bhardwaj et al., Integr.

Creatine's importance has been established by its use as an ergogenic aid in sport, as well as the development of intellectual disability in patients with congenital creatine deficiency. Creatine biosynthesis is complemented by dietary creatine uptake. Intracellular transport of creatine is carried out by a creatine transporter protein (CT1/CRT/CRTR) encoded by the SLC6A8 gene. Most tissues express this gene, with highest levels detected in skeletal muscle and kidney. There are lower levels of the gene detected in colon, brain, heart, testis and prostate. The mechanism(s) by which this regulation occurs is still poorly understood. A duplicated unprocessed pseudogene of SLC6A8–SLC6A10P has been mapped to chromosome 16p11.2 (contains the entire SLC6A8 gene, plus 2293bp of 5′flanking sequence and its entire 3′UTR). Expression of SLC6A10P has so far only been shown in human testis and brain. It is still unclear as to what is the function of SLC6A10P. In a patient with autism, a chromosomal breakpoint that intersects the 5′flanking region of SLC6A10P was identified; suggesting that SLC6A10P is a non-coding RNA involved in autism. Our aim was to investigate the presence of cis-acting factor(s) that regulate expression of the creatine transporter, as well as to determine if these factors are functionally conserved upstream of the creatine transporter pseudogene.Via gene-specific PCR, cloning and functional luciferase assays we identified a 1104bp sequence proximal to the mRNA start site of the SLC6A8 gene with promoter activity in five cell types. The corresponding 5′flanking sequence (1050bp) on the pseudogene also had promoter activity in all 5 cell lines. Surprisingly the pseudogene promoter was stronger than that of its parent gene in 4 of the cell lines tested. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first experimental evidence of a pseudogene with stronger promoter activity than its parental gene.  aPublisher supplied data 3a3' untranslated regions 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aautism 3abiosynthesis 3abrain 3achromosome mapping 3acolon 3acreatine 3acreatine kinase 3aenergy 3aheart 3ahumans 3akidneys 3aluciferase 3anon-coding RNA 3apatients 3aphosphocreatine 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apromoter regions 3apseudogenes 3askeletal muscle 3asports 3atestes 0aATP 0abp 0akb 0acDNA 0aGAPDH 0agDNA 0aEGFP 0aSV40 0achr 0aMEFs 0aHEK293 0a3T3 Swiss 0aSK-N-SH 0amRNA 0amiRNA 0aORF 0aPCR 0aRTPCR 0aSLC6A8 0aSLC6A10P 0aUTR 0aCreatine transport 0aTranscriptional regulation 0aPromoter 0aPseudogene1 aLusink, Vera1 aBeaubrun, Claudine1 aKanhai, Warsha1 aMartinez-Munoz, Cristina1 aJakobs, Cornelis1 aSalomons, Gajja S.0 tGene.g2014 Jan. 10, v. 533 p.488-493dElsevier B.V.x0378-11197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2013.10.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03565naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245014000164300001100304500001900315520208900334592002802423650000802451650003302459650001602492650002002508650001402528650001402542650002402556650001402580650001102594650001302605650000902618650003102627650001302658650001302671651002102684700001902705700001602724700002002740700002002760700001802780700002002798700005302818773010802871856008302979852000903062655001203071IND60712636620221116193156.0210731e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071263662DNAL7 a10.1186/s12985-020-01337-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Namhee10aFifteen new nucleotide substitutions in variants of human papillomavirus 18 in Korea : Korean HPV18 variants and clinical manifestation  ap. 70.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aHigh-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is an essential factor for the development of cervical cancer. HPV18 is the second most common carcinogenic HPV type following HPV16, but the lineages of HPV18 have been less well studied than those of HPV 16. The purpose of this study was to analyze the nucleotide variants in the E6, E7, and L1 genes of HPV18, to assess the prevalence of HPV18 variants in Korea and to explore the relationship between HPV18 genetic variants and the risk for cervical cancer.A total of 170 DNA samples from HPV18-positive cervical specimens were collected from women admitted to a secondary referral hospital located in Seoul. Among them, the lineages of the 97 samples could be successfully determined by historical nomenclature.All the studied HPV 18 variants were lineage A. Sublineages A1 and A4 comprised 91.7% (89/97) and 1.0% (1/97), respectively. Sublineages other than A1 or A4 comprised 7.2% (7/97). We identified 15 new nucleotide substitutions among 44 nucleotide substitutions: C158T, T317G, T443G, A560G, A5467G, A5560C, A5678C, A6155G, G6462A, T6650G, G6701A, T6809C, A6823G, T6941C and T6953C. Among them, 6 substitutions at positions 317, 443, 5467, 5560, 6462, and 6823 resulted in amino acid changes (E6: F71L and N113K; L1: H13R, H44P, A345T, and N465S, respectively). The pathologic results were classified as normal in 25.8% (25/97) of the women, atypical squamous cells of undermined significance (ASCUS) in 7.2% (7/97), cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 1 in 36.1% (35/97), CIN2/3 in 19.6% (18/97), and carcinoma in 12.4% (12/97). There was no significant association between the HPV18 sublineages and the severity of pathologic lesion or the disease progression.This study is the first to analyze the distribution of HPV18 variants in Korean and to associate the results with pathologic findings. Although the HPV18 variants had no significant effect on the degree and progression of the disease, the newly discovered nonsynonymous mutation in L1 might serve as a database to determine vaccine efficacy in Korean women.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aHuman papillomavirus type 18 3aamino acids 3acarcinogenicity 3acarcinoma 3adatabases 3adisease progression 3ahospitals 3ahumans 3amutation 3arisk 3auterine cervical neoplasms 3avaccines 3avirology 3aKorean Peninsula1 aPark, Jeong Su1 aKim, Ji Eun1 aPark, Jae Hyeon1 aPark, Hyunwoong1 aRoh, Eun Youn1 aYoon, Jong Hyun1 aShin, Sue1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4791-86710 tVirology journal.g2020 Dec., v. 17, no. 1 p.70-70dBioMed CentralwJournal:J000001738x1743-422X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12985-020-01337-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03362naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245011200163300001600275520145700291592002801748650001501776650001601791650001501807650001501822650001901837650001301856650001501869650002601884650003101910650002401941650002001965650002601985650002002011650001002031650002002041650001002061650002402071650003202095650001802127650004302145650001002188650001002198650002002208650002702228650001502255650002502270653001402295653001502309653002302324653001302347653003202360700001802392700001402410700001602424700001402440700001802454700001602472773012102488856008202609852000902691655001202700IND60684711520221122222411.0200318e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068471152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jes.2020.02.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Yiwen10aPotential regulation of small RNAs on bacterial function activities in pig farm wastewater treatment plants  ap. 292-300.  aSmall RNAs (sRNAs) are key players in the regulation of bacterial gene expression. However, the distribution and regulatory functions of sRNA in pig farm wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) remains unknown. In this study, the wastewaters in anoxic and oxic tanks of the WWTPs were collected. The profiles of the community structure, mRNA expression, and sRNA expression of bacteria in pig farm wastewater were investigated using transcriptome sequencing and qPCR. This study demonstrated that there was a higher abundance of sRNA in the pig farm WWTPs and 52 sRNAs were detected. The sRNAs were mainly present in Proteobacteria and Firmicutes, including the potential human pathogenic bacteria (HPB) (Escherichia, Shigella, Bordetella and Morganella), crop pathogen (Pectobacterium) and denitrifying bacteria (Zobellella). And the sRNAs were involved in the bacterial functional activities such as translation, transcription, drug resistance, membrane transport and amino acid metabolism. In addition, most sRNAs had a higher abundance in anoxic tanks which contained a higher abundance of the genes associated with infectious diseases and drug resistance than that in oxic tanks. The results presented here show that in pig farm WWTPs, sRNA played an important role in bacterial function activities, especially the infectious diseases, drug resistance and denitrification, which can provide a new point of penetration for improving the pig farm WWTPs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBordetella 3aEscherichia 3aFirmicutes 3aMorganella 3aPectobacterium 3aShigella 3aZobellella 3aamino acid metabolism 3aanimal pathogenic bacteria 3acommunity structure 3adenitrification 3adenitrifying bacteria 3adrug resistance 3afarms 3agene expression 3agenes 3ainfectious diseases 3alivestock and meat industry 3amessenger RNA 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aswine 3atanks 3atranscriptomics 3atranslation (genetics) 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 0aSmall RNA 0aRegulation 0aBacterial function 0aPig farm 0aWastewater treatment plants1 aXing, Sicheng1 aLi, Sumin1 aNiu, Yajing1 aLi, Cheng1 aHuang, Tuoxin1 aLiao, Xindi0 tJournal of environmental sciences (China).g2020 May, v. 91 p.292-300dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12417x1001-07427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jes.2020.02.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02366naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245015500162300001600317520112700333592002801460650003001488650001401518650001601532650001501548650001001563650002401573650001801597650001501615650001301630650004301643650002101686700001701707700001801724700001601742700001501758773013801773856004801911852000901959655001201968IND50073658520221119091241.0140306e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007365852DNAL7 a10.1007/s00343-014-3173-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Lin10aAssociation of triacylglyceride content and transcript abundance of genes involving in lipid synthesis of nitrogen deficient Phaeodactylum tricornutum  ap. 397-402.  aPhaeodactylum tricornutum is a diatom that is rich in lipids. Recently, it has received much attention as a feedstock for biodiesel production. Nitrogen deficiency is widely known to increase the content of neutral lipids (mainly triacylglycerides, or TAGs) of microalgae, including P. tricornutum, but the mechanism is unclear. In this study, we deciphered the correlations between TAG content and nine key enzymatic genes involved in lipid synthesis in P. tricornutum. After being cultured under nitrogen-free conditions for 0, 4, 24, 48, 72, 120, and 168 h, the TAG contents of P. tricornutum cells were assayed and the transcript abundances of the target genes were monitored by quantitative real-time PCR. The results show that the abundances of four target gene transcripts (LACS3, G3PDH2, G3PDH3, and G3PDH5) were positively correlated with TAG content, indicating that these genes may be involved in TAG synthesis in P. tricornutum. The findings improve our understanding of the metabolic network and regulation of lipid synthesis and will guide the future genetic improvement of the TAG content of P. tricornutum.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhaeodactylum tricornutum 3abiodiesel 3acorrelation 3afeedstocks 3agenes 3agenetic improvement 3amessenger RNA 3amicroalgae 3anitrogen 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3atriacylglycerols1 aHan, Jichang1 aYang, Guanpin1 aZhu, Baohua1 aPan, Kehou0 tChinese journal of oceanology and limnology.g2014 Mar., v. 32, no. 2 p.397-402dSpringer-VerlagwJournal:J000001677x0254-40597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00343-014-3173-8  aDNAL 7aarticle05212naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245015600161500001900317520344900336592002803785650000803813650001403821650001403835650001003849650001603859650001903875650001903894650001703913650001403930650001303944650002203957650002503979650001804004650001704022650001604039650001104055650001604066650001204082650001204094650001904106650001004125650002404135650001804159650002304177650001804200650001904218650001204237650002304249650001904272650002204291650001404313650001504327650002004342650001904362773012204381856007404503852000904577655001204586IND60732168120221120043536.0210326e20210225xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073216812DNAL7 a10.3390/nu130307292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMillward, D  Joe10aInteractions between Growth of Muscle and Stature: Mechanisms Involved and Their Nutritional Sensitivity to Dietary Protein: The Protein-Stat Revisited  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aChildhood growth and its sensitivity to dietary protein is reviewed within a Protein-Stat model of growth regulation. The coordination of growth of muscle and stature is a combination of genetic programming, and of two-way mechanical interactions involving the mechanotransduction of muscle growth through stretching by bone length growth, the core Protein-Stat feature, and the strengthening of bone through muscle contraction via the mechanostat. Thus, growth in bone length is the initiating event and this is always observed. Endocrine and cellular mechanisms of growth in stature are reviewed in terms of the growth hormone-insulin like growth factor-1 (GH-IGF-1) and thyroid axes and the sex hormones, which together mediate endochondral ossification in the growth plate and bone lengthening. Cellular mechanisms of muscle growth during development are then reviewed identifying (a) the difficulties posed by the need to maintain its ultrastructure during myofibre hypertrophy within the extracellular matrix and the concept of muscle as concentric “bags” allowing growth to be conceived as bag enlargement and filling, (b) the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in the mechanotransduction of satellite and mesenchymal stromal cells, to enable both connective tissue remodelling and provision of new myonuclei to aid myofibre hypertrophy and (c) the implications of myofibre hypertrophy for protein turnover within the myonuclear domain. Experimental data from rodent and avian animal models illustrate likely changes in DNA domain size and protein turnover during developmental and stretch-induced muscle growth and between different muscle fibre types. Growth of muscle in male rats during adulthood suggests that “bag enlargement” is achieved mainly through the action of mesenchymal stromal cells. Current understanding of the nutritional regulation of protein deposition in muscle, deriving from experimental studies in animals and human adults, is reviewed, identifying regulation by amino acids, insulin and myofibre volume changes acting to increase both ribosomal capacity and efficiency of muscle protein synthesis via the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) and the phenomenon of a “bag-full” inhibitory signal has been identified in human skeletal muscle. The final section deals with the nutritional sensitivity of growth of muscle and stature to dietary protein in children. Growth in length/height as a function of dietary protein intake is described in the context of the breastfed child as the normative growth model, and the “Early Protein Hypothesis” linking high protein intakes in infancy to later adiposity. The extensive paediatric studies on serum IGF-1 and child growth are reviewed but their clinical relevance is of limited value for understanding growth regulation; a role in energy metabolism and homeostasis, acting with insulin to mediate adiposity, is probably more important. Information on the influence of dietary protein on muscle mass per se as opposed to lean body mass is limited but suggests that increased protein intake in children is unable to promote muscle growth in excess of that linked to genotypic growth in length/height. One possible exception is milk protein intake, which cohort and cross-cultural studies suggest can increase height and associated muscle growth, although such effects have yet to be demonstrated by randomised controlled trials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aadiposity 3aadulthood 3abirds 3ablood serum 3abone formation 3abreast feeding 3achild growth 3achildhood 3achildren 3aenergy metabolism 3aextracellular matrix 3agrowth models 3agrowth plate 3ahomeostasis 3ahumans 3ahypertrophy 3ainfancy 3ainsulin 3alean body mass 3amales 3amechanotransduction 3amilk proteins 3amuscle contraction 3amuscle fibers 3amuscle protein 3amuscles 3aprotein deposition 3aprotein intake 3aprotein synthesis 3arapamycin 3asatellites 3askeletal muscle 3aultrastructure0 tNutrients.g2021 Feb. 25, v. 13, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu130307293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03335naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002700150245011500177300001200292520168900304592002801993650001802021650001702039650002102056650000902077650001102086650002502097650002202122650001602144650003102160650001502191650001202206650001102218650002602229650001302255650001902268650001402287650002602301650004002327653001702367653002602384653002302410653001402433653001502447700001802462700001902480700002002499700001602519700002702535773012502562856008502687852000902772655001202781IND60531734120221122001110.0190318e20161001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053173412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetimm.2016.06.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarvalho, Maria Isabel10aIntratumoral FoxP3 expression is associated with angiogenesis and prognosis in malignant canine mammary tumors  ap. 1-9.  aThe activity of regulatory T cells (Tregs) is closely associated with the expression of FoxP3 transcription factor. FoxP3 regulatory T cells (FoxP3Treg) have immunosuppressive properties and can work for prevention of harmful autoimmune responses, however can also interfere with beneficial anti-tumor immunity. In human breast cancer these cells play a crucial role in tumor progression. In canine mammary tumors (CMT) this topic is not well-documented. This study included 80 malignant CMT and studied, by immunohistochemistry, the intratumoral FoxP3 expression together with microvessel density (MVD), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and several clinicopathological characteristics. Abundant FoxP3Treg cells were associated with tumor necrosis (p=0.001), high mitotic grade (p<0.001), more marked nuclear polymorphism (p=0.001), poor differentiation of tumors (p<0.001), high histological grade of malignancy (HGM) (p<0.001), presence of neoplastic intravascular emboli (p<0.001) and presence of lymph node metastasis (p<0.001). Intratumoral FoxP3 was correlated with MVD (r=0.827; p<0.001) and associated with VEGF (p=0.001). Additionally tumors with abundant FoxP3Treg cells were associated with shorter overall survival (OS) time in univariate and multivariate analysis (p<0.001 Kaplan–Meier curves and 7.97 hazard ratio, p<0.001 Cox proportional hazard model). Results suggest that Treg cells play a role in CMT progression and may contribute to increased angiogenesis and aggression in these tumors. The association of intratumoral FoxP3 expression with shorter OS in multivariate analysis suggests the usefulness of Treg cells as an independent prognostic marker.  aPublisher supplied data 3aT-lymphocytes 3aangiogenesis 3abreast neoplasms 3adogs 3ahumans 3aimmunohistochemistry 3aimmunosuppression 3alymph nodes 3amammary neoplasms (animal) 3ametastasis 3amitosis 3amodels 3amultivariate analysis 3anecrosis 3aneoplasm cells 3aprognosis 3atranscription factors 3avascular endothelial growth factors 0aAngiogenesis 0aCanine mammary tumors 0aFoxP3T lymphocytes 0aPrognosis 0aTreg cells1 aPires, Isabel1 aPrada, Justina1 aGregório, Hugo1 aLobo, Luiz,1 aQueiroga, Felisbina L.0 tVeterinary immunology and immunopathology.g2016 Oct. 01, v. 178 p.1-9dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl31971x0165-24277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2016.06.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03169naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245006800167300001400235520183700249592002802086650001502114650002202129650003102151650001502182650001702197650001902214650002202233650001702255650002002272650001102292650002102303650003002324653003002354653002302384653002702407653001702434653001702451653001502468700002602483700001702509773009402526856008202620852000902702655001202711IND60553484620221119042415.0170607e20151115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055348462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2015.05.0532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThen, Whui Lyn10aQuantitative blood group typing using surface plasmon resonance  ap. 79-84.  aThe accurate and reliable typing of blood groups is essential prior to blood transfusion. While current blood typing methods are well established, results are subjective and heavily reliant on analysis by trained personnel. Techniques for quantifying blood group antibody–antigen interactions are also very limited. Many biosensing systems rely on surface plasmon resonance (SPR) detection to quantify biomolecular interactions. While SPR has been widely used for characterizing antibody–antigen interactions, measuring antibody interactions with whole cells is significantly less common. Previous studies utilized SPR for blood group antigen detection, however, showed poor regeneration causing loss of functionality after a single use. In this study, a fully regenerable, multi-functional platform for quantitative blood group typing via SPR detection is achieved by immobilizing anti-human IgG antibody to the sensor surface, which binds to the Fc region of human IgG antibodies. The surface becomes an interchangeable platform capable of quantifying the blood group interactions between red blood cells (RBCs) and IgG antibodies. As with indirect antiglobulin tests (IAT), which use IgG antibodies for detection, IgG antibodies are initially incubated with RBCs. This facilitates binding to the immobilized monolayer and allows for quantitative blood group detection. Using the D-antigen as an example, a clear distinction between positive (>500RU) and negative (<100RU) RBCs is achieved using anti-D IgG. Complete regeneration of the anti-human IgG surface is also successful, showing negligible degradation of the surface after more than 100 regenerations. This novel approach is validated with human-sourced whole blood samples to demonstrate an interesting alternative for quantitative blood grouping using SPR analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibodies 3aantigen detection 3aantigen-antibody reactions 3abiosensors 3ablood groups 3ablood sampling 3ablood transfusion 3aerythrocytes 3ahuman resources 3ahumans 3aimmunoglobulin G 3asurface plasmon resonance 0aSurface plasmon resonance 0aBlood group typing 0aRed blood cells (RBCs) 0aRh phenotype 0aIgG antibody 0aDiagnostic1 aAguilar, Marie-Isabel1 aGarnier, Gil0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2015 Nov. 15, v. 73 p.79-84dElsevier B.V.x0956-56637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2015.05.0533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02702naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245008600172500002200258506011700280506007600397520111800473592002801591506003701619650001801656650003001674650002901704650001701733650001401750650001301764651001101777651002501788653004301813653002801856653001001884653001401894700001701908700001701925700001901942700001901961700002701980700002402007700002002031773007402051856008602125852000902211655001202220IND60788669620221207084054.0220824e20220803xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078866962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2022.08.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMacklin, Grace R10aEpidemiology of type 2 vaccine-derived poliovirus outbreaks between 2016 and 2020  aPre-press version  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe number and geographic breadth of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) outbreaks detected after the withdrawal of type 2 containing oral polio vaccine (April 2016) have exceeded forecasts.Using Acute Flaccid Paralysis (AFP) investigations and environmental surveillance (ES) data from the Global Polio Laboratory Network, we summarize the epidemiology of cVDPV2 outbreaks. Between 01 January 2016 to 31 December 2020, a total of 68 unique cVDPV2 genetic emergences were detected across 34 countries. The cVDPV2 outbreaks have been associated with 1596 acute flaccid paralysis cases across four World Health Organization regions: 962/1596 (60.3%) cases occurred in African Region; 619/1596 (38.8%) in the Eastern Mediterranean Region; 14/1596 (0.9%) in Western-Pacific Region; and 1/1596 (0.1%) in the European Region. As the majority of the cVDPV2 outbreaks have been seeded through monovalent type 2 oral poliovirus vaccine (mOPV2) use in outbreak responses, the introduction of the more stable novel oral poliovirus vaccine will be instrumental in stopping emergence of new cVDPV2 lineages.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEnterovirus C 3aWorld Health Organization 3aenvironmental monitoring 3aepidemiology 3aparalysis 3avaccines 3aEurope 3aMediterranean region 0aCirculating vaccine-derived poliovirus 0aAcute flaccid paralysis 0aPolio 0aOutbreaks1 aGoel, Ajay K1 aMach, Ondrej1 aTallis, Graham1 aAhmed, Jamal A1 aO'Reilly, Kathleen M.,1 aGrassly, Nicholas C1 aDiop, Ousmane M0 tVaccine.g2022 Aug. 03, dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2022.08.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03544naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001400153245010100167300001600268520182500284592002802109650001402137650001802151650001902169650001702188650001702205650001202222650001902234650000902253650001602262650002502278650004302303650001502346650002202361650000902383650001502392650002302407650001102430650001602441650001902457650002902476650001502505651001102520653002202531653001402553653001702567653003502584653002902619700001602648700001202664700001802676700001702694700001502711773011902726856008802845852000902933655001202942IND60592185320221123001415.0201125e20180415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059218532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.11.1742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFox, D.M.10aHow wildfire risk is related to urban planning and Fire Weather Index in SE France (1990–2013)  ap. 120-129.  aWildfires burn >450,000ha of forest every year in Euro-Mediterranean countries. Many fires originate in the Wildland Urban Interface (WUI) where housing density and weather conditions affect fire occurrence. Housing density is determined by long term land use policies while weather conditions evolve quickly. The first objective was to quantify the impacts of land use policy on WUI characteristics and fire risk in SE France during 1990–2012. The second objective was to quantify how Fire Weather Index (FWI) is related to fire occurrence. WUI was mapped from 1990, 1999, and 2012 building layers and crossed with a NDVI derived vegetation layer. In all, 12 WUI categories were derived: 4 building density classes and 3 vegetation layers. The I87 FWI was based on daily temperature, wind speed, relative humidity and soil water content. Despite a 30% increase in the number of new buildings, WUI area increased by only 5% as new housing filled in open space in existing WUI area. This trend can be linked to national level urban planning legislation and forest fire protection laws. Major driver variables determining housing location were aspect, slope, and distance to city centers. Fire frequency and burned area were nonlinearly related to FWI: 73% of the 99 fires occurred during weeks with FWI values ≥90 even though these accounted for only 44% of all weeks. Burned area was even more sensitive to FWI since 97% of total burned area occurred during weeks with mean FWI values ≥90. All days with burned areas >100ha had FWI values >150. The study demonstrated that WUI legislation can be an efficient tool to limit WUI fire risk. FWI results suggest the predicted increase in extreme summer heat events with global warming could increase burned area as firefighting resources are stretched beyond capacity.  aPublisher supplied data 3abuildings 3afire fighting 3afire frequency 3afire weather 3aforest fires 3aforests 3aglobal warming 3aheat 3aland policy 3alaws and regulations 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3aopen space 3arelative humidity 3arisk 3asoil water 3asoil water content 3asummer 3atemperature 3aurban planning 3awildland-urban interface 3awind speed 3aFrance 0aLand use planning 0aWildfires 0aForest fires 0aWildland Urban Interface (WUI) 0aFire Weather Index (FWI)1 aCarrega, P.1 aRen, Y.1 aCaillouet, P.1 aBouillon, C.1 aRobert, S.0 tScience of the total environment.g2018 Apr. 15, v. 621 p.120-129dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.11.1743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03730naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245016600174300001400340520211400354592002802468650002502496650001102521650001202532650001502544650001902559650001502578650001702593650002102610650001302631650001102644650001702655650001402672650001702686650001602703650001902719650001002738651001002748653004202758653002502800653002402825653002602849653002702875653001802902653001002920700001802930700001602948700001502964773011602979856008403095852000903179655001203188IND60544906420221120052546.0160901e20130515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054490642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.palaeo.2013.03.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoscolo Galazzo, F.10aPaleoenvironmental changes during the Middle Eocene Climatic Optimum (MECO) and its aftermath: The benthic foraminiferal record from the Alano section (NE Italy)  ap. 22-35.  aThe Middle Eocene Climatic Optimum (MECO) was one of the most severe, short-term global climate perturbations of the Cenozoic that occurred at ca. 40Ma and was characterized by a gradual 4–6°C temperature increase of intermediate and deep-waters. We investigated the response to the MECO of the deep-sea ecosystem in the central-western Tethys, through a quantitative study of bathyal benthic foraminiferal assemblages in the expanded and continuous Alano section (northeastern Italy), for which data on stratigraphy, lithology, isotope and trace element geochemistry, and calcareous microplankton were available. During the gradual warming of MECO (lasting between 350 and 650kyr) marine export productivity increased, causing a significant but transient restructuring of benthic foraminiferal faunas, which changed gradually from assemblages typical for oligo-mesotrophic sea floor conditions to assemblages indicative of more eutrophic conditions. Just after the peak MECO conditions, which lasted less than 100kyr, a prolonged phase of environmental instability (~500kyr) occurred, marked by even more highly increased export productivity leading to bottom-water oxygen depletion, as reflected in deposition of organic-rich sediments and multiple peaks of bi-triserial opportunistic benthic foraminiferal taxa, including buliminids, bolivinids and uvigerinids. The high productivity may have been caused by a strong influx of nutrient-bearing fresh water into the basin, due to the increased vigour of the hydrological cycle during the warm period, and this increased fresh-water influx might have been a factor in enhancing water column stratification, thus exacerbating the hypoxic conditions, which persisted about 400–500kyr. After deposition of the organic-rich layers the environmental perturbation ended, and benthic foraminiferal assemblages recovered while conditions became very similar to what they were before the MECO. The environmental disturbance during and directly after the MECO thus strongly but transiently affected benthic foraminiferal assemblages in the central western Tethys.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanaerobic conditions 3abasins 3aclimate 3aecosystems 3aeutrophication 3afreshwater 3ageochemistry 3ahydrologic cycle 3aisotopes 3aoxygen 3apaleoecology 3asediments 3astratigraphy 3atemperature 3atrace elements 3avigor 3aItaly 0aMiddle Eocene Climatic Optimum (MECO) 0aBenthic foraminifera 0aMarine productivity 0aSea floor oxygenation 0aCentral-western Tethys 0aAlano section 0aItaly1 aGiusberti, L.1 aLuciani, V.1 aThomas, E.0 tPalaeogeography, palaeoclimatology, palaeoecology.g2013 May 15, v. 378 p.22-35dElsevier B.V.x0031-01827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2013.03.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02705naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100002400149245011400173300001600287520123700303592002801540650002301568650002501591650001601616650001201632650002701644650001101671650001401682650001201696650001101708650001301719650002401732650001701756650001801773650001001791650001601801650001101817650001601828650002801844653001701872653001301889653001501902653001501917653001101932653001901943700001701962773011301979856008602092852000902178655001202187IND4480139420221118062605.0190408e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448013942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.indcrop.2012.05.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuzia, Débora M.M.10aBioactive substance contents and antioxidant capacity of the lipid fraction of Annona crassiflora Mart. seeds  ap. 231-235.  aAnnona crassiflora Mart. is a typical fruit of the Brazilian cerrado, considered to be a species of economic interest, mainly for its use in cooking, which is widespread among the inhabitants of that region, and can be found in many typical local dishes, especially sweets, jellies, liqueurs, soft drinks, ice creams and juices. Thus, the objective of this study was to determine the bioactive substance contents and the antioxidant capacity of the lipid fraction of A. crassiflora Mart. seeds in the interest of better identifying the quality of this raw material from the Brazilian cerrado. After the receipt of the fruits, the seeds were removed manually and, then, the lipid fraction was obtained by cold extraction with chloroform:methanol:water (2:1:0.8, v/v/v) and analyzed for the composition of phytosterols, tocopherols, fatty acids, total carotenoids, antioxidant activity and oxidative stability index. The lipid fraction showed significant quantity of bioactive substances, especially phytosterols, tocopherols and unsaturated fatty acids, as well as significant antioxidant capacity and oxidative stability, influenced by the content of phytosterols and the composition of fatty acids present in the analyzed fraction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnnona crassiflora 3aantioxidant activity 3acarotenoids 3acerrado 3afatty acid composition 3afruits 3aice cream 3ajellies 3ajuices 3aliqueurs 3aoxidative stability 3aphytosterols 3araw materials 3aseeds 3asoft drinks 3asweets 3atocopherols 3aunsaturated fatty acids 0aAntioxidants 0aAraticum 0aBioactives 0aExtraction 0aFruits 0aVegetable oils1 aJorge, Neuza0 tIndustrial crops and products.g2013 Mar., v. 42 p.231-235dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49222x0926-66907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2012.05.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03703naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005700139245021500196300001600411500001900427500002000446520209100466592002802557596005802585596005602643650003102699650002602730650001202756650001402768650002002782650001102802650001302813650003302826650001702859650001402876650001402890650001602904650001502920650001002935700001402945700001402959700001702973700001702990773013203007856007303139852000903212655001203221IND60711251220221119154646.0200919e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071125122DNAL7 a10.1111/jam.146702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStummer, B.E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3892-367410aQuantification of Trichoderma afroharzianum, Trichoderma harzianum and Trichoderma gamsii inoculants in soil, the wheat rhizosphere and in planta suppression of the crown rot pathogen Fusarium pseudograminearum  ap. 971-990.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAIMS: Develop quantitative assays (qPCR) to determine the detection threshold limits, colonization and persistence of Trichoderma gamsii, Trichoderma afroharzianum and T. harzianum inoculants in cropping soils, the wheat rhizosphere and their in planta suppressive efficacy against the crown rot pathogen Fusarium pseudograminearum. METHODS AND RESULTS: Trichoderma qPCR primers were designed from the internal transcribed spacer region of 5.8S rDNA and from sequences of DNA fragments diagnostic for each inoculant genotype. The minimum detection thresholds of qPCR assays varied between 1 × 10³ (log 3) and 8 × 10⁴ (log 4·9) conidia (genome) equivalents per gram of soil for multi‐ and single‐copy target sequences, respectively and were independent of soil type. There was a strong correlation (r > 0·974) between culture‐dependent and culture‐independent (qPCR) quantification methods. In wheat bioassays, Trichoderma inoculants colonized rhizosphere soils and wheat roots at 56–112 days postemergence to a depth of 20 cm but were more abundant (P < 0·001) at 0–10 cm root depth, means ranging from 2 × 10² (log 2·3) to 4 × 10⁵ (log 5·6) conidia equivalents per gram of rhizosphere soil or root tissue. Inoculants reduced (P < 0·001) F. pseudograminearum biomass in wheat crown and root tissue by up to 5754‐fold and increased (P = 0·008) plant biomass, relative to the pathogen control. CONCLUSIONS: The qPCR assays provided sensitive and accurate assessment of wheat root and rhizosphere soil colonization of Trichoderma inoculants. Strains persisted through to grain maturity at levels shown to significantly suppress F. pseudograminearum in planta. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The qPCR assays developed here were used to determine the wheat rhizosphere dynamics of T. harzianum, T. afroharzianum and T. gamsii inoculants and their suppressive efficacy against F. pseudograminearum in planta. These assays can be applied to monitor inoculant dynamics in suppressing crown rot and other wheat root diseases in the field.  aPublisher supplied data  aCSP00162cGrains Research and Development Corporation  aResearch FellowshipcShandong Provincial Government 3aFusarium pseudograminearum 3aTrichoderma harzianum 3aconidia 3acrown rot 3adetection limit 3agenome 3agenotype 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3amicrobiology 3apathogens 3aphytomass 3arhizosphere 3asoil types 3awheat1 aZhang, Q.1 aZhang, X.1 aWarren, R.A.1 aHarvey, P.R.0 tJournal of applied microbiology.g2020 Oct., v. 129, no. 4 p.971-990dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl54923x1364-50727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jam.146703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03199naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005400148245016200202300001800364520164600382592002802028596007802056650002802134650002502162650001402187650001202201650001202213650002802225650001202253650001102265650001402276650002502290650002402315650002502339650000902364650001802373650001002391651001002401700001702411700001702428700001202445700001502457700001502472700001502487773011102502856008302613852000902696655001202705IND60782877320221117181050.0220714e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078287732DNAL7 a10.1007/s00468-022-02282-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeng, Chao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7413-856910aCunninghamia lanceolata sprout population structure, dynamics and biomass allocation changes during Phyllostachys edulis expansion in middleō-southern China  ap. 1207-1218.  aKEY MESSAGE: Chinese fir sprouting population lifespan is shortened and survivorship situation and biomass are also changed by bamboo expansion via declines in mother tree density and weakened physiological accommodation. Natural regeneration is a vital means of maintaining forest populations. Although bamboo expansion negatively affects population structures of neighboring communities, its influence on sprouting natural regeneration is still poorly understood. We compared the population structure and biomass allocation of Chinese fir regenerating sprouts in previous (CLS), middle (CPM) and late (PCM) periods of bamboo expansion. Life tables and survivorship curves were used to assess sprouting population structure and survival dynamics, and allometric analysis was conducted on biomass allocation. The results showed that bamboo expansion reduced the number and longevity (maximum age class shorted from X to VI) of the Chinese fir sprouting population and weakened its survival capacity. Survivorship curves indicated that the CLS population conformed more to a recession type (Deevey III) while CPM and PCM tended to be stable types (Deevey II). Highly mortality and survival risk in the early growing stage drove a population decrease. Meanwhile, sprouting component biomasses were decreased first and then increased by expansion effect, leaf and stem biomass had constant relationships with total biomass, and branch biomass had allometric relationships with total biomass. We considered that bamboo expansion changed sprouting population survival and growth mainly through affected Chinese fir mother tree density and growth.  aPublisher supplied data  aXLK201809cForestry Science and Technology Plan Project of Hunan Province 3aCunninghamia lanceolata 3aPhyllostachys edulis 3aallometry 3abamboos 3abiomass 3adry matter partitioning 3aforests 3aleaves 3alongevity 3anatural regeneration 3apopulation dynamics 3apopulation structure 3arisk 3asurvival rate 3atrees 3aChina1 aAi, Wensheng1 aQi, Lianghua1 aTu, Jia1 aMeng, Yong1 aYang, Ming1 aLi, Meiqun0 tTrees.g2022 Aug., v. 36, no. 4 p.1207-1218dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl43090x0931-18907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00468-022-02282-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02180naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245008800161520126300249592002801512650001501540650001001555650001301565650002201578650002201600650001301622651001501635700002301650773012301673856007301796852000901869655001201878IND60647874520221120111822.0190623e20180602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064787452DNAL7 a10.3390/d100200432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeleva, Stanimira10aDiversity and Conservation of Cave-Dwelling Bats in the Brunca Region of Costa Rica  aThe Brunca region in Costa Rica contains the largest number of caves in the country, yet the diversity and distribution of bat species within those caves is currently unknown. Without this information, it is not possible to assess changes in populations and assemblages that may indicate severe damages to these critical roosting habitats, and to take evidence-based conservation actions. We present the first study to describe the diversity of cave-dwelling bat species in the Brunca region of Costa Rica in a large number of caves. We collected data of bat species diversity by direct observation and capturing bats inside roosts. Bats were observed in 38 of the 44 surveyed caves, representing 20 species from 4 families, with colony sizes ranging from a few individuals to >7500. In addition, we collected information about the human activities carried out in and around the roosts to assess potential threats that these sites face. Data indicate that caves suffer mostly from unregulated tourist visitation and that one of the most visited caves is also the one with the most species-rich bat assemblages. Our study determined the most important and vulnerable bat roosts in the region and shows the need for urgent conservation actions to protect them.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChiroptera 3acaves 3ahabitats 3aroosting behavior 3aspecies diversity 3atourists 3aCosta Rica1 aChaverri, Gloriana0 tDiversity.g2018 June 02, v. 10, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21675x1424-28187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/d100200433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02639naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245012800170300001800298520108100316592002801397650004401425650002201469650002301491650000901514650002701523650003801550650001601588650001101604650003701615650001301652650001201665650002301677650003301700650001101733650001401744650002501758650002201783650002101805700001301826700002001839700002101859700001301880700001701893700002001910773010501930856008902035852000902124655001202133IND60558802320221118172244.0161117e20161117xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055880232DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.6b017992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFang, Yutang10aPreparation and Thermal Performance of Silica/n-Tetradecane Microencapsulated Phase Change Material for Cold Energy Storage  ap. 9652-9657.  aA novel silica (SiO₂)/n-tetradecane microencapsulated phase change material (MEPCM) was synthesized by in situ interfacial polycondensation. The influences of the amount of the composite emulsifier and the mass ratio of n-tetradecane and tetraethyl silicate on the MEPCM performance were systematically investigated. The morphology, chemical structure, and composition of the MEPCM were characterized by scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction, and its thermal performance and thermal stability were measured by differential scanning calorimetry and thermogravimetric analysis. The results showed that the n-tetradecane core material was successfully encapsulated by silica shell material with encapsulation ratio of 62.04%. The MEPCM had a melting enthalpy of 140.5 kJ kg–¹ and thermal conductivity of 0.139 W m–¹ K–¹. Because of its excellent thermal performance and thermal stability, silica/n-tetradecane MEPCM displays a good potential for cold energy storage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3achemical structure 3acold 3acondensation reactions 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3aemulsifiers 3aenergy 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3aenthalpy 3amelting 3amicroencapsulation 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asilica 3asilicates 3athermal conductivity 3athermal stability 3athermogravimetry1 aWei, Hao1 aLiang, Xianghui1 aWang, Shuangfeng1 aLiu, Xin1 aGao, Xuenong1 aZhang, Zhengguo0 tEnergy & Fuels.g2016 Nov. 17, v. 30, no. 11 p.9652-9657dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.energyfuels.6b017993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02831naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245012400165300001600289520152300305592002801828650004401856650001601900650002201916650002101938650001401959650001201973650002901985650001402014650000902028650002302037650001502060650001202075650001302087650001302100650003702113650002202150700002402172700001502196773009302211856008402304852000902388655001202397IND60098899320221117085810.0141105e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009889932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fuproc.2013.08.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRani, Ashu10aFly ash supported scandium triflate as an active recyclable solid acid catalyst for Friedel–Crafts acylation reaction  ap. 366-373.  aCoal generated fly ash is converted into an efficient solid Lewis acid catalyst by loading scandium triflate on thermally and chemically activated fly ash. The activation of fly ash increased the surface silanol groups responsible for loading of scandium triflate species on fly ash surface. The physico-chemical properties of prepared fly ash supported scandium triflate (FST) catalyst were examined by XRD, FTIR, TEM and TGA analysis. The proposed model structure of FST shows that the triflate species withdraws the electron density from the scandium resulting in generating electron deficient Lewis acid sites on fly ash surface as confirmed by NH₃ adsorbed FT-IR spectrum of FST catalyst. The catalyst showed higher activity for solvent free single pot Friedel–Crafts acylation of 2-methoxynaphthalene (2-MN) using acetic anhydride as an acylating agent achieving conversion up to 84% and selectivity of the desired product, 2-acetyle-6-methoxynaphthalene (6-AMN) up to 73%. 6-AMN is a precursor for anti-inflammatory drug, (S)-(+)-6-mathoxy-α-methyl-2-naphthaleneacetic acid, known as Naproxen. The stability of the catalyst was confirmed by hot filtration test. The catalyst could be easily regenerated and reused giving similar conversion up to three reaction cycles under similar experimental conditions. The work reports an alternative pathway for utilization of waste fly ash by using it in developing novel and cost effective, recyclable catalyst system for industrially important acylation reactions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aLewis acids 3aX-ray diffraction 3aacetic anhydride 3aacylation 3aammonia 3aanti-inflammatory agents 3acatalysts 3acoal 3acost effectiveness 3afiltration 3afly ash 3ascandium 3asolvents 3atransmission electron microscopy 3awaste utilization1 aKhatri, Chitralekha1 aHada, Renu0 tFuel processing technology.g2013 Dec., v. 116 p.366-373dElsevier B.V.x0378-38207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuproc.2013.08.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02802naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245015500160300001600315500001900331520160800350592002801958650001901986650002102005650002602026650002202052650001102074650001402085650000902099650001502108650001302123650001102136650001002147700001702157700001702174773013502191856008102326852000902407655001202416IND60650502220221118062523.0190710e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065050222DNAL7 a10.1017/S00218596160009522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEGAN, M.10aIncluding white clover in nitrogen fertilized perennial ryegrass swards: effects on dry matter intake and milk production of spring calving dairy cows  ap. 657-668.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe current experiment was undertaken to investigate the effect of including white clover (Trifolium repens L.; WC) into perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.; PRG) swards (PRG/WC) receiving 250 kg nitrogen (N) per hectare (ha) per year compared with PRG only swards receiving 250 kg N/ha/year, in an intensive grass-based spring calving dairy production scenario. Forty spring-calving cows were allocated to graze either a PRG/WC or PRG sward (n = 20) from 6 February to 31 October 2012. Fresh herbage was offered daily (17 kg dry matter (DM)/cow) supplemented with concentrate in times of herbage deficit (total supplementation 507 kg/cow). Pre-grazing herbage mass (HM), sward WC content and milk production were measured for the duration of the experiment. Herbage DM intake was estimated in May, July and September. Pre-grazing HM (±s.e.) was similar (1467 ± 173·1 kg DM/ha) for both treatments, as was cumulative herbage production (14 158 ± 769 kg DM/ha). Average WC content of the PRG/WC swards was 236 ± 30 g/kg DM. The PRG/WC cows had greater average daily milk yield and milk solids yield from June onwards. Cumulative milk yield and milk solids yield were greater for the PRG/WC cows compared with the PRG cows (5048 and 4789 ± 34·3 kg milk yield/cow, and 400 and 388 ± 1·87 kg milk solids/cow, respectively). Cows had similar DM intake in all measurements periods (15·1 ± 0·42 kg DM/cow/day). In conclusion, including WC in N-fertilized PRG swards increased milk production from cows grazing the PRG/WC swards compared with PRG, particularly in the second half of the lactation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLolium perenne 3aTrifolium repens 3aagricultural sciences 3adry matter intake 3aforage 3alactation 3amilk 3amilk yield 3anitrogen 3aspring 3asward1 aLYNCH, M.

I met Abba at a Society for Neuroscience meeting and learned that he was Editor-in-Chief of the Journal Peptides. I submitted manuscripts to the journal on “Neuropeptides as Growth Factors in Cancer” and subsequently was named to the Editorial Advisory Board. Over the past 30 years I have published dozens of manuscripts in Peptides and reviewed hundreds of submitted manuscripts. It was always rewarding to interact with Abba, a consummate professional. When I attended meetings in New Orleans I would sometimes go out to dinner with him at the restaurant “Commanders Palace”. When I chaired the Summer Neuropeptide Conference we were honored to have him receive the Fleur Strand Award one year in Israel. I think that his biggest editorial contribution has been the “Handbook of Biologically Active Peptides.” I served as a Section Editor on “Cancer/Anticancer Peptides” and again found that it was a pleasure working with him. This review focuses on the mechanisms by which bombesin-like peptides, neurotensin and vasoactive intestinal peptide regulate the growth of lung cancer.  aPublisher supplied data 3agrowth factors 3alung neoplasms 3aneurophysiology 3avasoactive intestinal peptide 0aLung cancer 0aBombesin 0aVasoactive intestinal peptide 0aNeurotensin1 aMoreno, Paola1 aJensen, R.

Here, we described a novel liquid crystal (LC)-in-LC emulsion composed of a nematic oil phase and a cholesteric or nematic aqueous cellulose nanocrystal (CNC) continuous phase. The guest oil droplets were stabilized and suspended in liquid-crystalline CNCs, inducing distortions and topological defects inside the host LC phase. These emulsions exhibited anisotropic interactions between the two LCs that depended on the diameter-to-pitch ratio of suspended guest droplets and the host CNC cholesteric phase. When the ratio was high, oil droplets were embedded into a cholesteric shell with a concentric packing of CNC layers and took on a radial orientation of the helical axis. Otherwise, discrete surface-trapped LC droplet assemblies with long-range ordering were obtained, mimicking the fingerprint configuration of the cholesteric phase. Thus, the LC-in-LC emulsions presented here define a new class of ordered soft matter in which both nematic and cholesteric LC ordering can be well-manipulated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanisotropy 3acellulose 3acolloids 3adroplets 3aemulsions 3aliquid crystals 3ananocrystals 3aoil-water interface 3aoils 3apolymers 3atopology1 aVasilyev, Gleb1 aVilensky, Rita1 aBoaz, Mor1 aZhang, Ruiyan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6739-20751 aMartin, Patrick1 aDahan, Nitsan1 aDeng, Shengwei1 aZussman, Eyal1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4310-65480 tLangmuir.g2018 Oct. 16, v. 34, no. 44 p.13263-13273dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19170x1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.8b021633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02805naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245009800174300001800272520118400290592002801474650002401502650001301526650002201539650001401561650002901575650001501604650001101619650001801630650001501648650001601663650001401679650001601693650002201709651001101731700002201742700002301764700002501787700002101812700002901833700001901862700002501881700002201906700002301928700002501951700002201976700002801998773015402026856008602180852000902266655001202275IND60549817520170925000000.0160909e20150522xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054981752DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jnatprod.5b000702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSantos, Mario

C.10aAnti-parasitic Guanidine and Pyrimidine Alkaloids from the Marine Sponge Monanchora arbuscula  ap. 1101-1112.  aHPLC-UV-ELSD-MS-guided fractionation of the anti-parasitic extract obtained from the marine sponge Monanchora arbuscula, collected off the southeastern coast of Brazil, led to the isolation of a series of guanidine and pyrimidine alkaloids. The pyrimidines monalidine A (1) and arbusculidine A (7), as well as the guanidine alkaloids batzellamide A (8) and hemibatzelladines 9–11, represent new minor constituents that were identified by analysis of spectroscopic data. The total synthesis of monalidine A confirmed its structure. Arbusculidine A (7), related to the ptilocaulin/mirabilin/netamine family of tricyclic guanidine alkaloids, is the first in this family to possess a benzene ring. Batzellamide A (8) and hemibatzelladines 9–11 represent new carbon skeletons that are related to the batzelladines. Evaluation of the anti-parasitic activity of the major known metabolites, batzelladines D (12), F (13), L (14), and nor-L (15), as well as of synthetic monalidine A (1), against Trypanosoma cruzi and Leishmania infantum is also reported, along with a detailed investigation of parasite cell-death pathways promoted by batzelladine L (14) and norbatzelladine L (15).  aPublisher supplied data 3aLeishmania infantum 3aPorifera 3aTrypanosoma cruzi 3aalkaloids 3aantiparasitic properties 3acell death 3acoasts 3afractionation 3aguanidines 3ametabolites 3aparasites 3apyrimidines 3aspectral analysis 3aBrazil1 aHarper, Philip M.1 aWilliams, David E.1 aMesquita, Juliana T.1 aPinto, Érika G.1 ada Costa-Silva, Thais A.1 aHajdu, Eduardo1 aFerreira, Antonio G.1 aSantos, Raquel A.1 aMurphy, Patrick J.1 aAndersen, Raymond J.1 aTempone, Andre G.1 aBerlinck, Roberto G.

Dogs included in the study were all sexually altered, predominantly large breed dogs with a mean age of 3.9-years (range, 0.5 to 9.0-years). The most common location was the rostral maxilla. Invasion of underlying bone and lymphadenopathy were evident on CT imaging in most dogs. No evidence of metastasis was found on mandibular lymph node cytology and thoracic radiography. Histologic analysis revealed similar morphologic findings for all surgically resected tumors. Surgical excision with 1–2 cm margins was complete in all cases, with a mean tumor-free interval of 12.1-months.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell biology 3adogs 3aexcision 3ahistology 3aimage analysis 3alymph nodes 3alymphatic diseases 3amedical records 3ametastasis 3aradiography 3asquamous cell carcinoma 3atomography 3aveterinary dentistry1 aSnyder, Christopher J.1 aSimmons, Betsie T.1 aPinkerton, Marie E.1 aChun, Ruthanne0 tJournal of veterinary dentistry.g, v. 30, no. 1 p.18-24dSAGE PublicationswJournal:26868x2470-40837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0898756413030001023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02525naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245010600173300001400279520143100293592002801724650001501752650001401767650001601781650001301797650001201810650001401822650001101836653001201847653002301859653001601882653001501898700002401913773013201937856008502069852000902154655001202163IND60544907020221120025743.0190321e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054490702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.palaeo.2013.04.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHutchings, Jack A.10aNo honor among snails: Conspecific competition leads to incomplete drill holes by a naticid gastropod  ap. 32-38.  aIncomplete drill holes in shelled invertebrate prey produced by predatory gastropods are often interpreted as failed attacks, and the frequency of incomplete drill holes in a sample is thought to provide insight into the effectiveness of prey defensive adaptations. Here, we conduct an experimental test of the hypothesis that differences in the frequencies of incomplete drill holes do not necessarily indicate anything about the prey and can instead be triggered by disturbance competition among conspecific drilling gastropods. Our test employed the western Atlantic naticid gastropod Neverita delessertiana and its venerid bivalve prey Chione elevata. The experiment consisted of an isolation treatment, where predators fed in the absence of conspecifics, and a competition treatment, where predators fed in groups of three. Competitive interactions, which included grappling, prey theft, and cannibalism, were found to be important in determining the presence of incomplete drill holes, as this trace was absent in the isolation treatment but present in the competition treatment, with the frequency of incomplete drill holes increasing in interactions among larger gastropods. These results suggest that interpretations of both field and fossil data must consider the role of competitive disruption as an additional mechanism underlying long-term patterns in the frequency of incomplete drill holes in the fossil record.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGastropoda 3aVeneridae 3acannibalism 3adrilling 3afossils 3apredators 3asnails 0aNaticid 0aDrilling predation 0aCompetition 0aEscalation1 aHerbert, Gregory S.0 tPalaeogeography, palaeoclimatology, palaeoecology.g2013 June, v. 379-380 p.32-38dElsevier B.V.wJournal:2694x0031-01827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2013.04.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02263naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245010100170300001400271520104600285592002801331650001201359650002601371650001901397650003001416650002001446650001401466650002901480650001301509650001301522650000901535650001001544650001201554650001401566650001801580650001601598700001801614700002501632773009101657856008401748852000901832655001201841IND60098899620221117085450.0141105e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009889962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fuproc.2013.04.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Chunguang10aCharacteristics of waste printing paper and cardboard in a reactor pyrolyzed by preheated agents  ap. 63-71.  aWe studied the characteristics of waste printing paper and cardboard particles in a reactor pyrolyzed by preheated agents with the aim of simulating a real case in a fixed-bed gasifier. A TGA/DSC was first used to study of the kinetics and enthalpy change of the printing paper and cardboard pyrolysis. Pyrolitic conversion was further carried out in a batch-type reactor with non-electrical heating. Syngas, tar and char were produced and characterized from printing paper and cardboard pyrolysis at 400°C, 500°C and 600°C. Different flow rates of carrier gas were applied to study the effect of residence time on the products distribution. When the flow rate increased, the relative mass change of gas agrees with that of tar. With increase in temperature, the yield of furfural, olefins and other non-aromatic compounds in tar decreased, while phenols and heavier aromatic hydrocarbons increased. The evolution of CO2, CO and other gas species in the syngas was presented. Van Krevelan diagram of chars was also presented in the paper.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkenes 3aaromatic hydrocarbons 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon dioxide production 3acarbon monoxide 3acardboard 3adistribution (economics) 3aenthalpy 3afurfural 3aheat 3apaper 3aphenols 3apyrolysis 3asynthesis gas 3atemperature1 aYang, Weihong1 aBlasiak, Wlodzimierz0 tFuel processing technology.g2013 Dec., v. 116 p.63-71dElsevier B.V.x0378-38207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuproc.2013.04.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03055naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245011900172300001400291520150700305592002801812650002201840650001901862650001401881650002301895650001301918650002001931650001701951650001701968650001801985650001302003650001902016650001802035650001602053650001302069650001802082650003102100650003302131650001902164650001702183650001402200650001602214650001502230700002902245700002302274700001902297700002502316773009102341856008402432852000902516655001202525IND60098899720221117090136.0141105e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009889972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fuproc.2013.04.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWitoon, Thongthai10aCO₂ hydrogenation to methanol over Cu/ZnO nanocatalysts prepared via a chitosan-assisted co-precipitation method  ap. 72-78.  aIn this study, CuO–ZnO nanocomposites were prepared by chitosan-assisted co-precipitation method and performed as catalyst for CO₂ hydrogenation to methanol. Effects of chitosan concentration on the physicochemical properties of the nanocomposites as well as the catalytic activity have been investigated. The obtained catalysts were characterized by means of scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, N₂ adsorption–desorption, N₂O chemisorption and temperature-programmed reduction. Chitosan was found to act not only as a coordination compound to produce a homogeneous combination of CuO–ZnO nanocomposite, but also as a soft template for the formation of hollow nanospheres. The CuO and ZnO crystallite sizes of the hollow nanospheres were found to be 11.5 and 18.8nm, respectively, which were smaller than those of other catalysts. The increase of chitosan concentration caused a change in catalyst morphology and a reduction in BET surface area as well as metallic copper surface area, but still higher than those of the unmodified catalyst. The catalysts prepared by using chitosan as precipitating agent exhibited a higher space time yield of methanol than the unmodified catalyst, which was attributed to a synergetic effect of the CuO nanoparticle incorporated in the CuO–ZnO nanocatalyst. However, when the reaction temperature was increased up to 533K, a decline in the space time yield of methanol was observed for the catalysts prepared at high chitosan concentration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3acarbon dioxide 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3achitosan 3acoprecipitation 3acrystallites 3acupric oxide 3ahydrogenation 3amethanol 3ananocomposites 3ananoparticles 3ananospheres 3anitrogen 3anitrous oxide 3aphysicochemical properties 3ascanning electron microscopy 3aspace and time 3asurface area 3asynergism 3atemperature 3azinc oxide1 aPermsirivanich, Tinnavat1 aDonphai, Waleeporn1 aJaree, Attasak1 aChareonpanich, Metta0 tFuel processing technology.g2013 Dec., v. 116 p.72-78dElsevier B.V.x0378-38207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuproc.2013.04.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02596naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005700153245017600210520119700386592002801583650001701611650001601628650001701644650001501661650001601676650001501692650001001707650002501717651001001742653002201752653002301774653002401797653001601821700005601837700001301893700001101906700001401917700001701931700001601948773010101964856008802065852000902153655001202162IND60741862420221118053231.0210806e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074186242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apgeochem.2021.1050142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Yuanxin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8156-318712aA case study of 10 years groundwater radon monitoring along the eastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau and in its adjacent regions: Implications for earthquake surveillance  aThe eastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau has been characterized by frequent disastrous earthquakes, which has induced changes in groundwater such as variations in isotopes, ions, and dissolved gases. In this study, the fluctuation of groundwater radon recorded at six different monitoring stations from 2009 to 2018 was analyzed. With the statistical approach (the residual signal processing technique and the Hurst exponent estimates), groundwater radon variations caused by seismic events were unraveled, reflecting regional stress status changes. The results of this study indicated that (1) groundwater radon exhibits distinct differences between the eastern margin of the Sichuan-Yunnan Block and the South China Block; (2) the precursory anomalies of groundwater radon are principally categorized into three types: positive, negative, and dual behaviors; (3) the relatively low level of the groundwater radon results from the underlying rock masses resisting the compressional stress and the locking on the Xianshuihe fault, the Anninghe fault, and the Zemuhe fault. Additionally, the seismic response zone of each monitoring station was delineated using historical seismic precursors.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3aearthquakes 3ageochemistry 3ageophysics 3agroundwater 3amonitoring 3aradon 3astatistical analysis 3aChina 0aGroundwater radon 0aSeismic precursors 0aThe Tibetan Plateau 0aFault zones1 aLiu, Zhaofei1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0227-83671 aLi, Ying1 aHu, Le1 aChen, Zhi1 aSun, Fengxia1 aLü, Chang,0 tApplied geochemistry.g2021 Aug., v. 131 p.105014-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11912x0883-29277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeochem.2021.1050143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02297naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245007200168520103600240592002801276650000801304650001901312650001301331650001001344650000901354650001901363650001401382650001201396650001701408650002601425650001301451650001801464650001501482650001101497650001601508653003201524653000801556653001401564653002101578700002101599700001801620773010901638856008301747852000901830655001201839IND60666223320221120154414.0191126e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066622332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fpsl.2019.1003952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Chengying12aA smart adhesive 'consume within' (CW) indicator for food packaging  aA CO2-sensitive, smart adhesive is reported in which a CO2-sensitive pigment, comprising the pH-sensitive dye, phenol red, PR, coated onto nano-particulate silica particles, is dispersed in a hot melt, pressure sensitive adhesive.

However, coverage amongst at-risk adults for recommended vaccines continues to be suboptimal. This study examined the perceptions of middle and older aged Australian adults towards hospital-based immunization programs and their previous exposures to receiving vaccines via tertiary care. A cross-sectional survey was conducted with Australian adults 45 years and older in late 2019 to capture influenza and pneumococcal vaccine uptake, exposure to hospital-based immunization programs, missed opportunities to vaccinate and receptiveness towards the promotion and/or delivery of vaccines in the hospital setting. Only 13 respondents reported receiving a vaccine at hospital, yet 72.2% (931/1292) indicated that they were willing to be vaccinated in that setting. Amongst those who attended hospital during 2019 and were eligible for vaccination, 57.2% and 28.3% of respondents were not immunized for pneumococcal and influenza, respectively. Missed opportunities for both vaccines were significantly higher amongst those at low-risk for influenza (≤65 years (low-risk): 52.9%, ≤65 years (high-risk): 18.3%, >65 years: 15.1%; p < 0.001) and pneumococcal (≤65 years (low-risk): 79.1%, ≤65 years (high-risk): 52.4%, >65 years: 44%; p < 0.001). Among those with a missed opportunity for hospital-based vaccination, the most common reason for not getting immunized was a lack of recommendation. Most (86.4%) reported that their general practitioner was the person or group they trusted most to receive vaccine information from. The findings from this Australian study support international work that shows very low rates of opportunistic vaccination in hospitals despite national recommendations to vaccinate prior to discharge. Considering the need for high levels of uptake of the COVID-19 vaccine, hospitals may need to be considered to opportunistically capture those not accessing the vaccine in other settings.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aStreptococcus pneumoniae 3across-sectional studies 3ahospitals 3ainfluenza 3avaccination 3avaccines 0aAdults 0aVaccination 0aImmunization 0aInfluenza 0aPneumococcal 0aAcceptance 0aHesitancy 0aHospital1 aHeywood, Anita1 aDyda, Amalie1 aKaufman, Jessica1 aSeale, Holly0 tVaccine.g2021 June 11, v. 39, no. 26 p.3467-3472dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2021.05.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03240naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245008600175300001800261520191400279592002802193650002902221650001502250650002102265650002602286650002602312650001402338650001602352650001302368653001202381653003202393700001602425700001702441700001302458700001502471700001402486700001502500700002302515700001402538700001802552700001802570773009902588856008602687852000902773655001202782IND60738542320221120151434.0220214e20210611xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073854232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2021.05.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBlanchard-Rohner, G10aPneumococcal immunity and PCV13 vaccine response in SOT-candidates and recipients  ap. 3459-3466.  aSolid organ transplantation (SOT) candidates and recipients are highly vulnerable to invasive pneumococcal diseases (IPD). Data on which to base optimal immunization recommendations for this population is scant. The national distribution of IPD serotypes led the Swiss Health Authorities to recommend in 2014 one dose of pneumococcal-13-valent-conjugate-vaccine (PCV13), without any subsequent dose of the 23-valent-polysaccharide-pneumococcal-vaccine (PPV23). This is a retrospective analysis of pneumococcal immunity using a multiplex binding assay, to assess seroprotection rates against a selection of seven PCV13- and seven PPV23-serotypes in SOT-candidates and recipients evaluated and/or transplanted in 2014/2015 in the University Hospitals of Geneva. Seroprotection was defined as serotype-specific antibody concentration greater than 0.5 mg/l and overall seroprotection when this was achieved for ≥ 6/7 serotypes. Pre-vaccination and at time of transplant sera were available for 35/43 (81%), and 43/43 (100%) SOT-candidates respectively. At listing, 17/35 (49%) SOT-candidates were seroprotected against PCV13 and 21/35 (60%) against PPV23 serotypes. Following one systematic dose of PCV13 at listing, 35/43 (81%) SOT-recipients were seroprotected at day of transplant against PCV13-serotypes and 34/43 (79%) against PPV23 serotypes, compared to 21/41 (51%) and 28/41 (68%) respectively in the controls transplanted in 2013, before the systematic PCV13-vaccination. The systematic vaccination with PCV13 of all SOT candidates without additional PPV23 is a good strategy as it confers seroprotection against a wide range of pneumococcal serotypes. Indeed, one of five PCV13-vaccinated SOT-candidates was nevertheless not seroprotected at time of transplant, reflecting their partial immune competence, and indicating the need for additional dose of pneumococcal vaccines before transplant.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStreptococcus pneumoniae 3aantibodies 3aimmunocompetence 3aorgan transplantation 3aretrospective studies 3aserotypes 3avaccination 3avaccines 0aVaccine 0aSolid organ Transplantation1 aEnriquez, N1 aLemaître, B1 aCadau, G1 aGiostra, E1 aHadaya, K1 aMeyer, P.,1 aGasche-Soccal, P.M1 aBerney, T1 avan Delden, C1 aSiegrist, C-A0 tVaccine.g2021 June 11, v. 39, no. 26 p.3459-3466dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2021.05.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03144naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245011300165300001200278520199200290592002802282650001102310650001302321650001202334650002802346650001702374650001602391650002302407650001402430650001502444650001502459651002002474700001402494700002002508700001602528773012402544856008102668852000902749655001202758IND60440080920221119161012.0151030e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044008092DNAL7 a10.1007/s11270-015-2475-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGraham, P. W.10aField Measurement of Fluorescent Dissolved Organic Material as a Means of Early Detection of Leachate Plumes  ap. 211.  aEarly detection of landfill leachate plumes may minimise aquifer degradation and financial expenditure for the landfill operator. Current methods of landfill leachate monitoring typically include analysis of groundwater field parameters such as electrical conductivity (EC), coupled with laboratory analysis of a selection of major cations and anions. In many instances, background influences can mask the impact of leachate, which only becomes apparent once a significant impact has occurred. Here, we investigate the potential for changes in fluorescent dissolved organic material (FDOM) concentration to be used as an indicator of leachate impact. The research was undertaken in a fractured rock aquifer located downgradient of a local government-operated putrescible landfill in Central West NSW, Australia. Field measurement of groundwater FDOM was undertaken using an in situ fluorometer (FDOM probe) which provides a relative measurement of FDOM. To quantify the FDOM values, a bench fluorescence spectrophotometer was used to collect excitation/emission spectra. A plume of elevated FDOM and EC levels within the fractured rock system up to 600 m downgradient of the landfill was identified, whereas analysis of major cations and anions from boreholes within the plume did not detect leachate impacts above background. Excitation/emission matrices of groundwater from these locations confirmed that similar fluorescence signatures to those collected from the landfill were present. Photodegradation experiments were conducted to determine if fluorescent whitening agents (FWAs) were a component of the fluorescence signal. Observed photodegradation of 40 % compared to background (8 %) suggests that a component of the fluorescence signal can be attributed to FWAs. FDOM in groundwater therefore provides an indicator of low-level (up to 98 % dilution) leachate influence, and the identification of FWAs within groundwater can be considered confirmation of a leachate signal.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanions 3aaquifers 3acations 3aelectrical conductivity 3afluorescence 3agroundwater 3alandfill leachates 3alandfills 3amonitoring 3aphotolysis 3aNew South Wales1 aBaker, A.1 aAndersen, M.

Vehicle emissions are one of the largest contributed sources of toluene, but no studies evaluating the influence of living near a road on the association between toluene and the incidence of thyroid cancer have been reported. Therefore, we examined potential associations between blood toluene concentrations and incidence risk of thyroid cancer, and an effect modification of living near a road.We conducted a prospective cohort study using data from South Korean “Monitoring Project for Exposure to Environmental Pollutants and Health Effects among Residents Living near Industrial Complexes” survey. Study participants living near national industrial complexes were recruited from January 2003 to 2011. Incidence and mortality cases of thyroid cancer (C73, ICD-10 code) were identified using the National Cancer Registry and Statistics Korea, respectively. Blood toluene concentrations were measured using gas chromatography mass spectrometry. We used Cox proportional hazards regression models to estimate the hazard ratios (HR) and the 95% confidence interval (CI) between blood toluene concentrations and thyroid cancer risk.During the follow-up (median 8.6 years), 33 cases of thyroid cancer were diagnosed. The geometric mean of the toluene concentration in the blood was 0.56 μg/L for cases and 0.29 μg/L for non-cases. After adjusting for potential confounders, a positive association between blood toluene concentrations and thyroid cancer was found (HR = 2.77, 95% CI = 1.00–7.65 in the highest tertile vs. the lowest tertile, p for trend = 0.044). This positive association was stronger in people living near a road (≤50 m).Blood toluene concentrations may be positively associated with the incidence risk of thyroid cancer. Moreover, this association may be stronger among people living near a road.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood 3acarcinogens 3acohort studies 3aconfidence interval 3aenvironment 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3amortality 3apeople 3arisk 3athyroid neoplasms 3atoluene 3aSouth Korea 0aBMI 0aCI 0aGM 0aGSD 0aHR 0aLOD 0aNIER 0aRERI 0aSD 0aT1 0aT2 0aT3 0aVOCs 0aToluene 0aChemical pollutant 0aEnvironmental pollutant 0aThyroid cancer 0aLiving near a road1 aPark, Eunjung1 aSong, Sang-Hwan1 aLee, Chul-Woo1 aKwon, Jung-Taek1 aPark, Eun Young1 aKim, Byungmi0 tEnvironment international.g2021 Jan., v. 146 p.106304-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6374x0160-41207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2020.1063043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01422naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002800144245009200172300001600264520024300280592002800523650001500551650001900566650001100585650000900596650001200605650001400617650001300631653001300644653002400657653001600681700001900697700003000716700002700746700002400773773015200797856007800949852000901027655001201036IND60522875920221121224101.0160604e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052287592DNAL7 a10.1515/znc-1993-7-8092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSikorski, Aleksander F.12aA Protein Cross-Reacting with Anti-Spectrin Antibodies is Present in Higher Plant Cells  ap. 580-583.  aProteins that react with anti-hum an spectrin antibodies raised in rabbit were found in pea seedlings and leaves.

Endothelial dysfunction is a prominent feature found in many inflammatory diseases. Adhesion molecules, such as VCAM-1, mediate the attachment of monocytes to endothelial cells, thereby playing an important role in endothelial inflammation. The effects of PRC in regards to endothelial inflammation remain unknown. In this study, our findings show that PRC can be inhibited by the inflammatory cytokine LPS in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). In the presence of LPS, the expression of endothelial cell adhesion molecular, such as VCAM1 and E-selectin, is found to be increased. These effects can be negated by overexpression of PRC. Importantly, monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells caused by LPS is significantly attenuated by PRC. In addition, overexpression of PRC protects mitochondrial metabolic function and suppresses the rate of glycolysis against LPS. It is also found that overexpression of PRC decreases the transcriptional activity of NF-κB. These findings suggest that PRC is a negative regulator of endothelial inflammation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3acell adhesion 3acytokines 3agenes 3aglycolysis 3ahuman umbilical vein endothelial cells 3ainflammation 3alung function 3amonocytes 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 0aPGC-1-related coactivator (PRC) 0aMonocytes adhesion 0aVascular inflammation 0aNF-κB1 aDaixing, Zhou1 aQiang, Zhong1 aShusheng, Li0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2013 Sept. 13, v. 439 p.121-125dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2013.08.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03106naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245011700169300001600286520179200302592002802094650006702122650001202189650001102201650001702212650001602229650002002245650001502265650001602280650001902296650001702315650001102332650001102343650002802354651001002382651001702392700001702409700001702426700001802443773011802461856008402579852000902663655001202672IND60123164520221118063919.0150325e20150117xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012316452DNAL7 a10.1080/01431161.2014.9952742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Qingsheng10aComparison of tasselled cap transformations based on the selective bands of Landsat 8 OLI TOA reflectance images  ap. 417-441.  aParameters for the tasselled cap transformation (TCT) have been derived for many sensors since 1976. There have been concerns about the comparability of TCT brightness (TCTB), greenness (TCTG), and wetness (TCTW) from different sensors because the number and bandwidth of spectral bands of the different sensors are not exactly the same and the derivation methods vary. In this research, comparisons between the TCT components derived from different combination images with a different number of spectral bands are considered. First, a new TCT based on a new data set from Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager top of atmosphere (OLI TOA) reflectance was developed. Then, a case study of the Yellow River Delta, China, demonstrated that TCT parameters derived from a Landsat 8 OLI TOA reference image from May 2013 were probably applicable to clear and nearly cloud-free images for spring, summer, and autumn over the Yellow River Delta. Finally, we compared the TCT components derived from selected bands of Landsat 8 OLI TOA reflectance images and those derived from images from other well-known moderate-resolution worldwide remote-sensing data by statistical characteristics, correlation coefficients, the optimum index factor (OIF), and classification with a support vector machine. The result supports our conclusion (a) that two new shortwave bands (Bands 1 and 9) of the Landsat 8 OLI have little effect on derivations of the TCT components and their ability to classify land cover type and (b) that Bands 4–7 in Landsat multispectral scanner, Bands 1–4 in Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER), and Bands 1–4 in Systeme Probatoire d’Observation dela Tarre 5 are sufficient for deriving TCTB, TCTG, and TCTW components and mapping land cover.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAdvanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer 3aLandsat 3aautumn 3acase studies 3acorrelation 3adata collection 3aland cover 3areflectance 3aremote sensing 3ariver deltas 3aspring 3asummer 3asupport vector machines 3aChina 3aYellow River1 aLiu, Gaohuan1 aHuang, Chong1 aXie, Chuanjie0 tInternational journal of remote sensing.g2015 Jan. 17, v. 36, no. 2 p.417-441dTaylor & Francisx1366-59017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2014.9952743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02911naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100002100169245014800190300001800338520111000356592002801466650001501494650001601509650001201525650002001537650001901557650001501576650001301591650001401604650001301618650001101631650002001642650002301662650002601685650003001711650002001741650003301761650001301794650002801807650003101835650001301866650002401879650002101903650002301924650002301947650002601970650003201996700001902028700002002047700001902067700001802086700002002104773009202124856008402216852000902300655001202309IND60088242820221119224326.0141102e20111215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008824282DNAL7 a220300842pmid7 a10.1016/j.watres.2011.09.0562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSahinkaya, Erkan10aSimultaneous heterotrophic and sulfur-oxidizing autotrophic denitrification process for drinking water treatment: Control of sulfate production  ap. 6661-6667.  aA long-term performance of a packed-bed bioreactor containing sulfur and limestone was evaluated for the denitrification of drinking water. Autotrophic denitrification rate was limited by the slow dissolution rate of sulfur and limestone. Dissolution of limestone for alkalinity supplementation increased hardness due to release of Ca²⁺. Sulfate production is the main disadvantage of the sulfur autotrophic denitrification process. The effluent sulfate concentration was reduced to values below drinking water guidelines by stimulating the simultaneous heterotrophic and autotrophic denitrification with methanol supplementation. Complete removal of 75 mg/L NO₃–N with effluent sulfate concentration of around 225 mg/L was achieved when methanol was supplemented at methanol/NO₃–N ratio of 1.67 (mg/mg), which was much lower than the theoretical value of 2.47 for heterotrophic denitrification. Batch studies showed that sulfur-based autotrophic NO₂–N reduction rate was around three times lower than the reduction rate of NO₃–N, which led to NO₂–N accumulation at high loadings.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkalinity 3abioreactors 3acalcium 3adenitrification 3adrinking water 3aguidelines 3ahardness 3alimestone 3amethanol 3asulfur 3awater treatment 2aAlkaliesxanalysis 2aAutotrophic Processes 2aBioreactorsxmicrobiology 2aDenitrification 2aDrinking Waterxmicrobiology 2aHardness 2aHeterotrophic Processes 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aKinetics 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aOxygenxanalysis 2aSulfatesxanalysis 2aSulfurxmetabolism 2aWaste Disposal, Fluid 2aWater Purificationxmethods1 aDursun, Nesrin1 aKılıç, Adem,1 aDemirel, Sevgi1 aUyanik, Sinan1 aÇınar, Özer,0 tWater research.g2011 Dec. 15, v. 45, no. 20 p.6661-6667dElsevier Ltdx0043-13547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2011.09.0563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02516naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245011200168300001600280520099800296592002801294650000801322650002701330650001101357650002201368650001101390650001401401650002101415650002401436650002301460650002701483650001301510650002801523650001101551653000701562653000801569653000801577653000801585653000801593653001201601653001001613653001101623653000901634653002401643653002701667653001001694653000801704653001801712700001901730773012201749856008201871852000901953655001201962IND60089798720221118022801.0160728e20130913xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008979872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2013.08.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChoi, Joon-Seok10aMaintenance of cellular ATP level by caloric restriction correlates chronological survival of budding yeast  ap. 126-131.  aThe free radical theory of aging emphasizes cumulative oxidative damage in the genome and intracellular proteins due to reactive oxygen species (ROS), which is a major cause for aging. Caloric restriction (CR) has been known as a representative treatment that prevents aging; however, its mechanism of action remains elusive. Here, we show that CR extends the chronological lifespan (CLS) of budding yeast by maintaining cellular energy levels. CR reduced the generation of total ROS and mitochondrial superoxide; however, CR did not reduce the oxidative damage in proteins and DNA. Subsequently, calorie-restricted yeast had higher mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), and it sustained consistent ATP levels during the process of chronological aging. Our results suggest that CR extends the survival of the chronologically aged cells by improving the efficiency of energy metabolism for the maintenance of the ATP level rather than reducing the global oxidative damage of proteins and DNA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aenergy 3aenergy metabolism 3agenome 3alongevity 3alow calorie diet 3amechanism of action 3amembrane potential 3amitochondrial membrane 3aproteins 3areactive oxygen species 3ayeasts 0aCR 0aCLS 0aROS 0aRLS 0aETC 0aH2DCFDA 0aDiOC6 0a8-OHdG 0aDNPH 0aCaloric restriction 0aChronological lifespan 0aAging 0aATP 0aBudding yeast1 aLee, Cheol-Koo0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2013 Sept. 13, v. 439 p.126-131dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2013.08.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02149naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245007000166300001400236520089500250592002801145650000801173650001901181650001301200650003201213650004801245650001701293650002301310650001501333651001201348653001301360653001701373653003101390653002101421700001801442700001601460700001801476700001701494700001501511773009301526856008701619852000901706655001201715IND60480039020221120171932.0160125e20141101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048003902DNAL7 a10.1556/AAlim.43.2014.Suppl.72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDarnay, L.10aProducion of low salt frankfurter with microbial transglutaminase  ap. 45-50.  aSeveral scientific papers suggest that microbial transglutaminase (mTG) is capable of reducing the salt content of cured and/or heat-treated meat products (ham, frankfurters, meat ball). These scientific results are not widely known in Hungary, and as a result of this, only little experience was gathered in our meat industry. According to this lack of knowledge, our aim was to lower the curing salt to a still microbiological safe level using mTG by frankfurters, one of the most well-known heat treated meat products in Hungary. The observed technofunctional properties suggest to use mTG enzyme preparation at 0.5% concentration. This enzyme dosage can reduce the average 1.8% salt content to 1.6% and it also may contribute to extended shelf life of popular frankfurters. Our sensorial analysis revealed that the panellists have not found a loss in quality between 1.4% and 1.6% salt.  aPublisher supplied data 3aham 3aheat treatment 3ahot dogs 3alivestock and meat industry 3aprotein-glutamine gamma-glutamyltransferase 3asalt content 3asensory evaluation 3ashelf life 3aHungary 0alow-salt 0afrankfurters 0amicrobial transglutaminase 0asensory analysis1 aDankovics, A.1 aMolnár, B.1 aFriedrich, L.1 aKenesei, Gy.1 aBalla, Cs.0 tActa alimentaria.g2014 Nov. 1, v. 43, no. 0 p.45-50dAkadémiai Kiadóx0139-30067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1556%2FAAlim.43.2014.Suppl.73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02319naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002400144245013000168300001600298520101500314592002801329650002301357650001101380650000801391650001901399650001001418650001901428650002301447650001401470650001301484650001001497650001801507650002001525650001601545653002301561653001401584653001601598653001901614653001301633773015201646856007801798852000901876655001201885IND60522876120221123015214.0160604e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052287612DNAL7 a10.1515/znc-1993-7-8112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBuscarlet, Louis A.10aStudy on the Influence of Temperature on the Mortality of Tribolium confusum J. du Val.

An important pest of stored grain is the beetle Tribolium confusum. T. confusum pupae, youn g and aged adults were exposed to pure nitrogen, CO₂ or air at different temperatures between 38 and 46 °C. In nitrogen as well as in CO₂ pupae were the most resistant. Nitrogen efficacy on adult mortality was much higher than CO₂ which was higher than air. For pupae CO₂ was more efficient than nitrogen or air in the range 38 - 45 °C. The temperature dependence of the sensitivity to both gases was noticeable in every stage, particularly below a given specific temperature. It was concluded that the combination controlled-atmosphere-temperature could be a valuable time saving and non aggressive technique for the stored-foods insects control.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTribolium confusum 3aadults 3aair 3acarbon dioxide 3aflour 3ainsect control 3aionizing radiation 3amortality 3anitrogen 3apupae 3astorage pests 3astored products 3atemperature 0aTribolium confusum 0aMortality 0aTemperature 0aCarbon Dioxide 0aNitrogen0 tZeitschrift für Naturforschung.g2014 June 2, v. 48, no. 7-8 p.590-594dVerlag der Zeitschrift für NaturforschungwJournal:23183x1865-71257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/znc-1993-7-8113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01627naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245006000166300001600226520058900242592002800831650002500859650001800884650001000902653001800912653001500930653001700945700001400962700001500976700001500991700001701006700001401023700001501037773012201052856008201174852000901256655001201265IND60089798920221118022748.0160728e20130913xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008979892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2013.08.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBordignon, B.12aA derivative of ascorbic acid modulates cAMP production  ap. 137-141.  aWe reported, in previous experiments, that AA is a global regulator of cAMP pools.

Owing to the spatial organization of cell-encapsulated hydrogel microstructures, three-dimensional (3D) tissue structures have been broadly applied as novel pathological or pharmacological models. However, the spatial reorganization of arbitrary microstructures with tissue-specific shapes into 3D in vitro microtissues that mimic the physiological morphology and nutrient diffusion of native tissues presents a major challenge. Here, we develop a versatile method that engineers permeable 3D microtissues into tissue-specific microscopic architectures. The customized, arbitrarily shaped hollow micromodules are prepared by photocopolymerizing poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA) with acryloyl-PEG-Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser (RGDS). These micromodules are spatially reorganized and self-aligned by a facile assembly process based on hydrodynamic interactions, forming an integrated geometry with tissue-specific morphology and a vessel-mimetic lumen. The RGD linkages create cell-adhesive structures in the PEGDA hydrogel, greatly increasing the long-term cell viability in 3D microtissue cultures. Meanwhile, the mechanical properties for fast cell spreading inside the microstructures can be optimized by modulating the PEGDA concentration.

To assess whether antibody titers may reasonably predict efficacy and serve as the basis of a CoP, we evaluated the relationship between efficacy and in vitro neutralizing and binding antibodies of 7 vaccines for which sufficient data have been generated. Once calibrated to titers of human convalescent sera reported in each study, a robust correlation was seen between neutralizing titer and efficacy (ρ = 0.79) and binding antibody titer and efficacy (ρ = 0.93), despite geographically diverse study populations subject to different forces of infection and circulating variants, and use of different endpoints, assays, convalescent sera panels and manufacturing platforms. Together with evidence from natural history studies and animal models, these results support the use of post-immunization antibody titers as the basis for establishing a correlate of protection for COVID-19 vaccines.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aantibodies 3ahumans 3anatural history 3avaccines 0aCOVID-19 0aSARS-CoV-2 0aVaccine 0aCorrelate of protection1 aAmbrosino, Donna M.1 aFiore-Gartland, Andrew1 aGoldblatt, David1 aGilbert, Peter B.1 aSiber, George R.1 aDüll, Peter,1 aPlotkin, Stanley A.0 tVaccine.g2021 July 22, v. 39, no. 32 p.4423-4428dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2021.05.0633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01510naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002400149245006800173300001800241520052600259592002800785650001400813650003600827650002300863650000700886650002100893650001600914650001500930700002200945700001700967773010600984856008501090852000901175655001201184IND60579147320221121092135.0170816e20160715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057914732DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.6b012052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDaniels, Matthew

The present study is aimed to prepare a new adsorbent magnesia-hydroxyapatite (Mg-HAP) that can serve as a valuable defluoridating agent. Characterization of the synthesized adsorbent was done by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Transmission electron microscope (TEM), and Scanning electron microscope (SEM)/Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) analysis to reveal the bonding patterns, phase characteristics, and microstructural and morphological details. The influences of pH, adsorbent dose, contact time, and initial fluoride concentration and the effect of interfering anions were studied. The defluoridation capacity was evaluated to be 1.4 mg/g, and the adsorbent showed very good capability to remove fluoride from contaminated water over a wide range of pH. Equilibrium modeling was done, and the experimental data was fitted into Langmuir, Freundlich, Temkin, and Dubinin-Radushkevich isotherms. Study of the kinetic data for the adsorption process revealed that it follows pseudo-second-order reaction. It also indicated that the intraparticle diffusion contributes to the rate-determining step in the process. The quality of treated water was analyzed for total dissolved solids (TDS), turbidity, residual calcium, residual phosphorus content, electrical conductivity, hardness, and total alkalinity. The results obtained were very promising and confirmed the prospects of usage of Mg-HAP in defluoridation of drinking water.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-radiation 3aX-ray diffraction 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aalkalinity 3aanions 3acalcium 3adrinking water 3aelectrical conductivity 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3ahardness 3amodels 3apH 3aphosphorus 3apublic health 3ascanning electron microscopes 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atotal dissolved solids 3atransmission electron microscopes 3atransmission electron microscopy 3aturbidity 3awater pollution1 aGeorge, Suja0 tWater, air, and soil pollution.g2015 Aug., v. 226, no. 8 p.241-241dSpringer International Publishingx0049-69797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-015-2515-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02823naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245016000162300001600322520132900338592002801667650001501695650001501710650002101725650001901746650001901765650001801784650002101802650001301823650001701836650001301853653004201866653002401908653002501932653002501957700001601982700001501998700001802013700001102031700001302042700001902055700001402074700002102088700001702109773011102126856008302237852000902320655001202329IND60566515020221119181515.0180831e20170815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056651502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2017.03.0622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPu, Qinli10aUniversal ratiometric electrochemical biosensing platform based on mesoporous platinum nanocomposite and nicking endonuclease assisted DNA walking strategy  ap. 719-727.  aThe occurrence and development of many complex diseases are associated with various molecules, whose contents are rarely in the early stage of the disease. Thus a universal platform for the ultrasensitive detection of multilevel biomarkers should be developed. In this study, we introduced an electrochemical biosensing system based on nicking endonuclease (Nt.BbvCI) assisted DNA walking strategy. We successfully constructed a universal signal-off-on ratiometric electrochemical biosensor for various biomolecules, including small molecules, nucleic acids, and proteins, by progressively optimizing the schematics (schemes 1, 2, and 3). The MB-hairpin probes (MB-HPs) acted as a signal-off probe, and nanocomposites (MPNs@DOX@DNA2) acted as a conventional signal-on probe (scheme 3). With the aid of the MPNs@DOX@DNA2 and Nt.BbvCI assisted DNA walking mechanism, the designed ratiometric electrochemical biosensor showed a high sensitivity and broad detection range. In addition, the proposed method can be utilized to detect diverse targets quantitatively by changing the sequence of aptamers under optimum experimental conditions. Furthermore, it has been widely proved to realize well-accepted signal response in identifying complex samples, thereby resulting in an wide prospect for bioanalysis and clinical diagnosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomarkers 3abiosensors 3aelectrochemistry 3agenome walking 3ananocomposites 3anucleic acids 3aoligonucleotides 3aplatinum 3aporous media 3aproteins 0aRatiometric electrochemical biosensor 0aMesoporous platinum 0aNicking endonuclease 0aDNA walking strategy1 aLi, Junlong1 aQiu, Juhui1 aYang, Xuanhua1 aLi, Yi1 aYin, Dan1 aZhang, Xinyuan1 aTao, Yiyi1 aSheng, Shangchun1 aXie, Guoming0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2017 Aug. 15, v. 94 p.719-727dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11631x0956-56637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2017.03.0623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03666naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245018700172500002200359520209900381592002802480650002002508650001302528650002202541650001002563650002402573650001202597650002102609650002202630650001402652650001102666650002102677650002702698650001902725650001202744650001002756650001802766651001002784653002702794653001002821653002502831653001702856653001202873653002802885700002402913773012902937856008503066852000903151655001203160IND60666223920221120154522.0191002e20190819xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066622392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jarmap.2019.1002192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPalkar, Rutuja S.10aGenetic diversity between and within the natural populations of Garcinia indica (Thouars) Choisy: A high value medicinal plant from Northern Western Ghats of India using ISSR markers  aPre-press version  aThe present study reveals genetic diversity between and within the natural populations of Garcinia indica which is an endemic and medicinally important tree species from the Western Ghats of India. During the study extensive field survey was carried out to different parts of the region and collected leaf samples from 11 different locations to assess genetic diversity between populations. To understand the genetic diversity within the population, leaf samples were collected from seven different locations (accessions) spread over the single large population at Amboli, Maharashtra. Out of 21 ISSR primers screened, 12 primers produced reproducible, clear banding pattern. A total of 127 bands amplified for the samples analyzed in between the populations, among them 119 were polymorphic and percent polymorphism varied from 80 to 100% per primer. Genetic diversity within the population shown a total of 85 amplified bands, out of which 74 were polymorphic and polymorphic percentages varied from 60 to 100% per primer. The other genetic diversity parameters revealed high diversity and differentiation in both between populations (percent polymorphism = 93.87%, h = 0.3196, na = 1.82, ne = 1.37, I = 0.41, Ht = 0.26 and GST = 0.81) and within population (percent polymorphism = 84.80%, h = 0.36, na = 1.88, ne = 1.56, I = 0.48, Ht = 0.32 and GST = 0.86). Dendrogram revealed two main clusters for both between and within the natural populations based on altitudinal variation and geographical distribution of the species which is significantly supported by Mantel correlation test for geographic and genetic distance among populations. G. indica is highly exploited for various traditional and pharmaceutical preparations and have demand in the national and international markets, the understanding of genetic diversity among the natural populations especially in Konkan regions where plants are abundant will help in conservation of potential germplasm and utilization for breeding programme for large scale cultivation by farmers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGarcinia indica 3aaltitude 3abreeding programs 3adrugs 3aessential oil crops 3afarmers 3agenetic distance 3agenetic variation 3agermplasm 3aleaves 3amedicinal plants 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aphytogeography 3asurveys 3atrees 3aworld markets 3aIndia 0aGermplasm conservation 0aKokum 0aMedicinal properties 0aPolymorphism 0aPopGene 0aSustainable utilization1 aSellappan, Krishnan0 tJournal of applied research on medicinal and aromatic plants.g2019 Aug. 19, dElsevier GmbHwJournal:23209x2214-78617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jarmap.2019.1002193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03382naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245017100159300001800330520208900348592002802437650002202465650002302487650002002510650001902530650001402549650001902563650001902582650000702601650001502608650002402623650001902647650001602666650002002682700002402702700002602726700001202752700001402764773009802778856007502876852000902951655001202960IND60577204920221117185147.0170807e20140311xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057720492DNAL7 a10.1021/la40499242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHenn, Daniel
M.10aTertiary-Amine-Containing Thermo- and pH-Sensitive Hydrophilic ABA Triblock Copolymers: Effect of Different Tertiary Amines on Thermally Induced Sol–Gel Transitions  ap. 2541-2550.  aThis Article reports on the synthesis of a series of well-defined, tertiary-amine-containing ABA triblock copolymers, composed of a poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) central block and thermo- and pH-sensitive outer blocks, and the study of the effect of different tertiary amines on thermally induced sol–gel transition temperatures (Tₛₒₗ–gₑₗ) of their 10 wt % aqueous solutions. The doubly responsive ABA triblock copolymers were prepared from a difunctional PEO macroinitiator by atom transfer radical polymerization of methoxydi(ethylene glycol) methacrylate and ethoxydi(ethylene glycol) methacrylate at a feed molar ratio of 30:70 with ∼5 mol % of either N,N-diethylaminoethyl methacrylate (DEAEMA), N,N-diisopropylaminoethyl methacrylate, or N,N-di(n-butyl)aminoethyl methacrylate. The chain lengths of thermosensitive outer blocks and the molar contents of tertiary amines were very similar for all copolymers. Using rheological measurements, we determined the pH dependences of Tₛₒₗ–gₑₗ of 10 wt % aqueous solutions of these copolymers in a phosphate buffer. The Tₛₒₗ–gₑₗ versus pH curves of all polymers exhibited a sigmoidal shape. The Tₛₒₗ–gₑₗ increased with decreasing pH; the changes were small on both high and low pH sides. At a specific pH, the Tₛₒₗ–gₑₗ decreased with increasing the hydrophobicity of the tertiary amine, and upon decreasing pH the onset pH value for the Tₛₒₗ–gₑₗ to begin to increase noticeably was lower for the more hydrophobic tertiary amine-containing copolymer. In addition, we studied the effect of different tertiary amines on the release behavior of FITC-dextran from 10 wt % micellar gels in an acidic medium at 37 and 27 °C. The release profiles for three studied hydrogels at 37 °C were essentially the same, suggesting that the release was dominated by the diffusion of FITC-dextran. At 27 °C, the release was significantly faster for the DEAEMA-containing copolymer, indicating that both diffusion and gel dissolution contributed to the release at this temperature.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaqueous solutions 3acomposite polymers 3aethylene glycol 3aethylene oxide 3ahydrogels 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3apH 3aphosphates 3apolyethylene glycol 3apolymerization 3atemperature 3atertiary amines1 aWright, Roger A.

A number of object-based verification methods have been developed to quantify the errors related to spatial patterns and placement of precipitation. In this study, an image processing technique known as watershed transformation, capable of detecting closely spaced, but separable precipitation areas, is adopted in the object-based approach. Several key attributes of the segmented precipitation objects are selected and interest values of those attributes are estimated based on the distance measurement of the estimated and reference images. An overall interest score is estimated from all the selected attributes and their interest values. The proposed object-based approach is implemented to validate satellite-based precipitation estimation against ground radar observations. The results indicate that the watershed segmentation technique is capable of separating the closely spaced local-scale precipitation areas. In addition, three verification metrics, including the object-based false alarm ratio, object-based missing ratio, and overall interest score, reveal the skill of precipitation estimates in depicting the spatial and geometric characteristics of the precipitation structure against observations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aimage analysis 3amodels 3aprediction 3aradar 3aremote sensing 3asatellites 3awatersheds 3aweather1 aHsu, K.1 aAghaKouchak, A.1 aSorooshian, S.0 tInternational journal of remote sensing.g2015 Jan. 17, v. 36, no. 2 p.513-529dTaylor & Francisx1366-59017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2014.9991703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02608naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245011200169520127500281592002801556650001601584650000801600650001101608650002501619650000901644650002201653650000901675650001101684650003701695650001701732650001001749650001801759650001601777653001701793653002701810653001901837653002201856653002401878653001801902700005801920773009001978856008502068852000902153655001202162IND60759651320221117062326.0220824e20220401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075965132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2021.1228682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGupta, Saurabh13aAn experimental investigation of high-ash coal gasification in a pilot-scale bubbling fluidized bed reactor  aGasification of low-grade, sub-bituminous coal with a high-ash content above 45% is carried out in a pilot-scale bubbling fluidized bed reactor using air and steam as the fluidizing gases. For a stable autothermal operation of the gasifier, the effects of equivalence ratio (φ) and steam/coal ratio (ψ) on syngas composition, carbon conversion, cold gas efficiency, and agglomeration behavior are investigated. The chemical composition of the ash samples is analyzed using X-ray fluorescence, whereas a scanning electron microscope, coupled with energy-dispersive spectroscopy, is utilized to inspect agglomerates formed during the gasification. The optimum range of φ is found in the range of 0.19–0.28, which maintains bed temperature in the range of 800−900°C. Steam injection increases heating value, carbon conversion, and gasification efficiency, however beyond a threshold value of ψ, no additional gain is observed. The highest heating value of the syngas obtained from the experiments is found to be 3 MJ/Nm3, whereas the corresponding carbon conversion and cold gas efficiency are found to be 85%, and 48%, respectively. At low fluidization numbers, agglomerates are formed due to local hotspots, as the collected ash sample has small alkali content.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aair 3acarbon 3achemical composition 3acoal 3acoal gasification 3acold 3aenergy 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3afluorescence 3asteam 3asynthesis gas 3atemperature 0aGasification 0aBubbling fluidized bed 0aHigh-ash coals 0aCarbon conversion 0aCold gas efficiency 0aAgglomeration1 aDe, Śāntanu,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6185-25600 tEnergy.g2022 Apr. 01, v. 244 p.122868-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2021.1228683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04199naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002800147245017900175300001800354506011700372506007600489520203900565592002802604506003702632650002502669650002002694650002202714650002002736650001002756650001202766650001402778650001902792650001502811650000902826650001902835650001202854650002002866650001602886650002102902650001502923650001602938650001602954650001502970650001702985650001503002650001203017650001103029650000903040653001803049653001903067653000803086653001903094653001003113700002303123700002803146700001603174700006203190700001903252700002003271700002203291773010903313856008203422852000903504655001203513IND60700061620221207074506.0220619e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070006162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.psj.2020.05.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbo Ghanima, Mahmoud M.10aConsequences of various housing systems and dietary supplementation of thymol, carvacrol, and euganol on performance, egg quality, blood chemistry, and antioxidant parameters  ap. 4384-4397.  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe present work was carried out to investigate the influences of housing system and dietary essential oils (EOs) supplementation to laying hens on the productive performance, egg quality, immunity, antioxidant parameters, and hematology. A factorial arrangement (2 × 4) was performed, including 2 housing systems and 4 different types of EOs (without EOs, thymol, carvacrol, and euganol) during the production stages (from 28–78 wk of age). Birds were randomly divided into 2 groups with each of 2,000 birds. The first group was moved to laying cages while the second group was a floor reared. Each group was randomly divided into 4 groups (5 replicates of 100 birds each): The first were considered as a control group, and the second, third, and fourth groups were treated with thymol, carvacrol, and euganol EO, respectively. The results showed that hens reared in cage system had higher egg weight (P < 0.05), egg production, egg mass, and feed intake and better feed conversion ratio (P < 0.001) than those reared in the floor system. Blood picture values (except white blood cells), phagocytic index, phagocytic activity, and blood chemistry parameters (except calcium, phosphorus, and urea values) of laying hens were not affected (P > 0.05) by housing system. The groups fed EOs showed a rapid improvement (P < 0.001) in the egg production%, egg weight, egg mass, and egg quality. Thymol group had the highest egg production (P < 0.001). Thymol and eugenol groups had the highest egg weight, egg mass, and egg quality (P < 0.001). The groups fed diets containing thymol or eugenol consumed lower feed and had better feed conversion ratio (P < 0.001) than the control group. Immunity indices (phagocytic activity [P < 0.05], avian influenza [AIH5 and AIH9], P < 0.001) were improved with the presence of EOs in the laying hen diet. These results strongly suggest that dietary EO supplementation could be a successful attempt to improve the productive performance, egg quality, and immunity of laying hens.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aantioxidant activity 3aavian influenza 3ablood cell counts 3ablood chemistry 3acages 3acalcium 3acarvacrol 3aegg production 3aegg weight 3aeggs 3aessential oils 3aeugenol 3afeed conversion 3afeed intake 3afeed supplements 3ahematology 3ahen feeding 3alaying hens 3aleukocytes 3aphagocytosis 3aphosphorus 3arearing 3athymol 3aurea 0aessential oil 0aegg production 0ahen 0ahousing system 0ablood1 aAlagawany, Mahmoud1 aAbd El-Hack, Mohamed E.1 aTaha, Ayman1 aElnesr, Shaaban S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4430-14921 aAjarem, Jamaan1 aAllam, Ahmed A.1 aMahmoud, Ayman M.0 tPoultry science.g2020 Sept., v. 99, no. 9 p.4384-4397dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45501x0032-57917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.psj.2020.05.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02129naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005700150245008600207520102100293592002801314650000801342650001501350650002201365650000901387650002301396650001201419650001901431653002601450653002101476653001901497653002001516700005901536773009001595856008501685852000901770655001201779IND60759651420221120144423.0220205e20220215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075965142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2021.1228692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDong, Hye-Won1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5044-610510aEnergy and economic analysis of organic Rankine cycle for liquid desiccant system  aThe main purpose of this study is to experimentally evaluate the energy and economic benefits of an organic Rankine cycle (ORC) based liquid desiccant (LD) assisted air conditioning system (ORCLD) for building applications. A district heating network was used as the heat source of the ORC, and the heat and power generated from the ORC was provided for the LD-assisted air conditioning system and building. The primary energy consumption, payback period, and life cycle cost of ORCLD were analyzed and compared with those of the LD-assisted air conditioning system as a reference system. There were two operation modes for ORCLD: power and heat priorities, which obtain the maximum power and heat output, respectively. As a result, the ORCLD with heat priority mode could save the primary energy consumption by 2.2% compared with the reference system and show the lowest payback period and life cycle cost. Consequently, the heat priority mode for the ORCLD is strongly recommended in terms of both energy and cost.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3adesiccants 3aeconomic analysis 3aheat 3alife cycle costing 3aliquids 3aprimary energy 0aOrganic rankine cycle 0aLiquid desiccant 0aPayback period 0aLife cycle cost1 aJeong, Jae-Weon1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5391-32980 tEnergy.g2022 Feb. 15, v. 241 p.122869-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2021.1228693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01396naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001600149245015100165300001800316520034700334592002800681650002100709650002300730650002300753650001100776650001200787650001300799650001700812700002600829700001500855773010600870856008500976852000901061655001201070IND60579147620221121092114.0170816e20160715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057914762DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.6b013432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Junchao10aCu(OAc)2-Mediated Cascade Annulation of Diarylalkyne Sulfonamides through Dual C–N Bond Formation: Synthesis of 5,10-Dihydroindolo[3,2-b]indoles  ap. 3322-3325.  aAn unusual cascade reaction featuring annulation of diarylalkyne sulfonamides to form 5,10-dihydroindolo[3,2-b]indoles has been realized with Cu(OAc)₂ as the sole oxidant.

The assay is based on the detection of 18S rRNA specific for Cryptosporidium oocysts. The standard curve of the ABC-PCR assay had a good fitting to a rectangular hyperbola with a correlation coefficient (R) of 0.9997. Concentrations of Cryptosporidium oocysts in real river water samples were successfully quantified by the ABC-reverse transcription (RT)-PCR assay. The quantified values by the ABC-RT-PCR assay very closely resemble those by the real-time RT-PCR assay. In addition, the quantified concentration in most water samples by the ABC-RT-PCR assay was comparable to that by conventional microscopic observation. Thus, Cryptosporidium oocysts in water samples can be accurately and specifically determined by the ABC-RT-PCR assay. As the only equipment that is needed for this end-point fluorescence assay is a simple fluorometer and a relatively inexpensive thermal cycler, this method can markedly reduce time and cost to quantify Cryptosporidium oocysts and other health-related water microorganisms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCryptosporidium 3acorrelation 3acost effectiveness 3aequipment 3afluorescence 3amicroorganisms 3aoocysts 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3aribosomal RNA 3ariver water 2aCryptosporidiumxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aOocystsxmetabolism 2aRNA Probesxmetabolism 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 18Sxanalysisxgenetics. 2aReference Standards 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reactionxmethods 2aWaterxparasitology 0aJapan1 aMiyata, Ryo1 aFuruta, Atsushi1 aIzumiyama, Shinji1 aTsuneda, Satoshi1 aSekiguchi, Yuji1 aNoda, Naohiro1 aAkiba, Michihiro0 tWater research.g2012 Jan. 1, v. 46, no. 1 p.187-194dElsevier Ltdx0043-13547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2011.10.0483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02853naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245011500167300001600282520149800298592002801796650002201824650001501846650001901861650002001880650002601900650001401926650001301940650001801953650001601971651001401987651001102001651001802012653001302030653002402043653002102067653000802088653000802096653000902104700001802113700001702131700001602148700001502164773009502179856008802274852000902362655001202371IND60480039820221120201153.0160125e20141101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048003982DNAL7 a10.1556/AAlim.43.2014.Suppl.162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParrag, V.10aEarly detection of cobweb disease infection on <i>Agaricus bisporus</i> sporocarps using hyperspectral imaging  ap. 107-113.  aFrom the nineteen-nineties, cobweb disease caused serious losses for the mushroom sector in Europe, in the USA, and in Australia (<span style="font-variant:small-caps"><small>Fletcher</small></span> & <span style="font-variant:small-caps"><small>Gaze</small></span>, 2008), so it is one of the most notable fungal infections of cultivated white button mushroom (<i>Agaricus bisporus</i>). The aim of this study was to identify cobweb disease (<i>Cladobortyum dendroides</i>) caused cap spotting and brownish rot on the mushroom sporocarp, and to find a proper discrimination method in the case of this infection.Fruiting body samples were divided into 4 groups, a control one and three others treated with different chemicals that are tested against fungal infections. The groups were subdivided into 2 portions and the first was infected with cobweb disease. Images of the caps were recorded and their hyperspectral images were acquired in the wavelength range of 900–1700 nm.On the hyperspectral images infected and healthy areas were selected, on these average spectra differences were found around the known water peaks (1200 and 1450 nm). The spatial distribution of the water content can be used for the detection of the spoilage, because the infected areas showed different reflection values at these water absorption peaks.Support Vector Machine method was applied successfully to discriminate between the infected and control groups and Monte Carlo cross-validation was carried out.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgaricus bisporus 3aabsorption 3acobweb disease 3afruiting bodies 3ahyperspectral imagery 3amushrooms 3aspoilage 3awater content 3awavelengths 3aAustralia 3aEurope 3aUnited States 0amushroom 0a<i>Cladobotryum</i> 0a<i>Dactylium</i> 0aHSI 0aSVM 0aMCCV1 aFelföldi, J.1 aBaranyai, L.1 aGeösel, A.1 aFirtha, F.0 tActa alimentaria.g2014 Nov. 1, v. 43, no. 0 p.107-113dAkadémiai Kiadóx0139-30067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1556%2FAAlim.43.2014.Suppl.163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03102naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001300148245009600161300001600257520166800273592002801941650001501969650002101984650001402005650001602019650002202035650001702057650001002074650002402084650001902108650001902127650001202146650001302158650001502171650003002186650001402216653001802230653003802248653002302286653001802309653003002327700001802357700001602375700001402391773011102405856008302516852000902599655001202608IND60566515420221119181610.0180831e20170815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056651542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2017.03.0672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Yang10aDual-targeting peptide probe for sequence- and structure-sensitive sensing of serum albumin  ap. 657-662.  aPeptide-protein interactions mediate numerous biologic processes and provide great opportunity for developing peptide probes and analytical approaches for detecting and interfering with recognition events. Molecular interactions usually take place on the heterogeneous surface of proteins, and the spatial distribution and arrangement of probes are therefore crucial for achieving high specificity and sensitivity in the bioassays. In this study, small linear peptides, homogenous peptide dimers and hetero bivalent peptides were designed for site-specific recognition of human serum albumin (HSA). Three hydrophilic regions located at different subdomains of HSA were chosen as targets for the molecular design. The binding affinity, selectivity and kinetics of the candidates were screened with surface plasmon resonance imaging (SPRi) and fluoroimmuno assays. Benefiting from the synergistic effect from the surface-targeted peptide binders and the flexible spacer, a heterogenetic dimer peptide (heter-7) with fast binding and slow dissociation behavior was identified as the optimized probe. Heter-7 specifically recognizes the target protein HSA, and effectively blocks the binding of antibody to HSA. Its inhibitory activity was estimated as 83nM. It is noteworthy that heter-7 can distinguish serum albumins from different species despite high similarities in sequence and structure of these proteins. This hetero bivalent peptide shows promise for use in serum proteomics, disease detection and drug transport, and provides an effective approach for promoting the affinity and selectivity of ligands to achieve desirable chemical and biological outcomes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibodies 3abinding capacity 3abioassays 3ablood serum 3adisease detection 3adissociation 3adrugs 3ahuman serum albumin 3ahydrophilicity 3aimage analysis 3aligands 3apeptides 3aproteomics 3asurface plasmon resonance 3asynergism 0aPeptide probe 0aSurface plasmon resonance imaging 0aSequence-sensitive 0aSerum albumin 0aDual-targeted interaction1 aHuang, Yanyan1 aJin, Yulong1 aZhao, Rui0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2017 Aug. 15, v. 94 p.657-662dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11631x0956-56637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2017.03.0673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02360naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100008900147245013300236300001600369520092700385592002801312596006001340650002201400650001701422650001001439650001701449650002501466650002501491650001401516650001801530651001101548651001001559651001801569651001801587700001501605700001601620700001601636700001701652700001301669700001401682773012701696856008201823852000901905655001201914IND60592877420221119211023.0191104e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059287742DNAL7 a10.1007/s10327-018-0776-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOhki, T.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5591-3849 http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5591-384910aMolecular characterization of Globodera pallida found in Japan using ribosomal DNA and mitochondrial cytochrome b gene sequences  ap. 230-236.  aIn Japan, Globodera pallida was first reported in Abashiri city, Hokkaido in 2015. Sequences of ribosomal DNA (rDNA) and mitochondrial cytochrome b gene (cytb) from the Japanese population of G. pallida were compared with those of overseas populations. The representative sequences for rDNA and for cytb from the Japanese population had 100% identity with the sequences from G. pallida populations of North America and Europe in GenBank. Phylogenetic analysis also showed that they clustered in the clade that included populations from Europe and North America. From these results, we concluded that the Japanese population of G. pallida is close to populations that have been reported in Europe and North America. Recent studies suggested that a few populations of G. pallida were introduced into Europe from South America and have spread to various places around the world, and according to our results, into Japan also.  aPublisher supplied data  a27039CcMinistry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries 3aGlobodera pallida 3acytochrome b 3agenes 3amitochondria 3amitochondrial genome 3anucleotide sequences 3aphylogeny 3aribosomal DNA 3aEurope 3aJapan 3aNorth America 3aSouth America1 aNarabu, T.1 aKushida, A.1 aOnodera, K.1 aFujimoto, T.1 aItou, K.1 aMaoka, T.0 tJournal of general plant pathology.g2018 May, v. 84, no. 3 p.230-236dSpringer JapanwJournal:jnl3871472x1345-26307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10327-018-0776-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02747naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002900152245010700181300001600288520137400304592002801678650001701706650001201723650001301735650001601748650001601764650004301780650001601823650001501839650001801854650000701872650003701879650002301916650001801939650001801957653004401975653002002019653001302039653001302052653000702065700002502072773009602097856008702193852000902280655001202289IND60566515620221119181406.0190408e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056651562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodcont.2017.03.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWongmaneepratip, Wanwisa10aEffects of oil types and pH on carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in grilled chicken  ap. 119-125.  aThe effects of oil types and the pH of marinade were investigated on the formation of carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (EPA priority 16 PAHs) in grilled chicken. The formation of PAHs in grilled chicken breast with different marinades after charcoal-grilling for 3 min/side was evaluated using high performance liquid chromatography with a photodiode array detector (HPLC-DAD). Compared with the control marinade treatment (without vegetable oil), the addition of commercial palm oil and sunflower oil that contained significantly different amounts of polyunsaturated and saturated fatty acids led to a significant (p < 0.05) increase in the PAH levels in grilled chicken from 190.1 μg/kg to 457.6 μg/kg and 376.6 μg/kg, respectively and there was only a slight difference between both oil marinade treatments due to the presence of antioxidant compounds in the commercial vegetable oils. The pH values of the marinade treatments for both acidic and alkali marinades using citric acid and sodium bicarbonate, respectively, produced the highest pH value (7.51, alkali marinade) which resulted in a major increase of more than 70% in the PAH levels in grilled chicken. The results of this study suggested that the addition of oil and/or alkali ingredients in the marinade could be important in increasing the levels of PAHs in grilled meat products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidants 3abreasts 3achickens 3acitric acid 3afatty acids 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aingredients 3amarinating 3ameat products 3apH 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3asodium bicarbonate 3asunflower oil 3avegetable oil 0aPolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) 0aGrilled chicken 0aMarinade 0aOil type 0apH1 aVangnai, Kanithaporn0 tFood control.g2017 Sept., v. 79 p.119-125dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl56242x0956-71357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2017.03.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02312naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245014000169300001600309520105000325592002801375650003701403650002101440650002201461650001501483650002501498650001301523650001101536650001301547650000901560650000901569650001101578650000701589650002301596650001601619700002801635700001701663773009701680856008101777990002301858852000901881655001201890IND60093102320221118053045.0141103e20120401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009310232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cej.2012.01.1202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDuranoğlu, Dilek10aKinetics and thermodynamics of hexavalent chromium adsorption onto activated carbon derived from acrylonitrile-divinylbenzene copolymer  ap. 193-202.  aAdsorption of hexavalent chromium onto activated carbon derived from acrylonitrile-divinylbenzene has been studied in aspect to thermodynamic and kinetics. Chromium adsorption has been investigated using different process parameters like pH, carbon dosage, contact time and temperature. Maximum chromium adsorption capacity was obtained at low pHs and high temperature. Freundlich isotherm model represented the experimental data very well. Chromium adsorption followed the pseudo-second-order kinetic model, which indicated chemical adsorption. The activation energy of adsorption was calculated as 26.07kJ/mol. The mean free sorption energy was >22kJ/mol and adsorption enthalpy was +73.77kJ/mol. All thermodynamic and kinetic calculations indicated the chemical interaction between the carbon surface and chromium ions. The isosteric heat of adsorption increased with surface loading, indicating energetically homogeneous surface of produced activated carbon. Adsorption mechanism has been investigated using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aactivated carbon 3aactivation energy 3aadsorption 3achemical engineering 3achromium 3aenergy 3aenthalpy 3aheat 3aions 3amodels 3apH 3asorption isotherms 3atemperature1 aTrochimczuk, Andrzej W.1 aBeker, Ulker0 tChemical engineering journal.g2012 Apr. 1, v. 187 p.193-202dElsevier B.V.x1385-89477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2012.01.1203Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02696naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002200154245007800176520154000254592002801794650001301822650002001835650001701855650001601872650001901888650001501907650001701922651001001939653002801949653002601977653001702003653002202020653002402042700006102066773009702127856008902224852000902313655001202322IND60738543420221121201736.0220207e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073854342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.landusepol.2021.1055472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTiepolo, Maurizio10aUrban expansion-flood damage nexus: Evidence from the Dosso Region, Niger  aThe current literature links flood exposure and the consequent damage in the sub-Saharan Africa to urban expansion. The main implication of this pertains to the fact that cities are the target of flood risk reduction. However, our knowledge of the built-up area expansion–flood damage nexus is still too scarce to support any risk reduction policy at the local scale. The objective of this study is to reconsider the link between urban expansion and flood damage widening the observation to rural settlements with open access information alternative to global datasets on flood damages and moderate resolution satellite images. Using very high-resolution satellite images accessible via Google Earth Pro, the expansion of 122 flooded settlements in the Dosso region (Niger) during the past 20 years is evaluated. Spatial dynamics is then compared with the rate of collapsed houses due to flooding. Finally, house collapses and retrofitting are compared. We discovered that cities expand at faster rates and with an opposite trend to that reported by the global datasets. However, hamlets and villages expand even more rapidly and suffer more house collapses than rural towns and cities. House consolidation is quicker than the settlement expansion but this is not sufficient to reduce damage from pluvial flooding. The proportion of the Poor to the total number of inhabitants in rural settlements is three times higher than that in urban settlements. Environmental justice is, therefore, not just an urban issue but a rural urgency.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3adata collection 3aflood damage 3aland policy 3arisk reduction 3asatellites 3aurbanization 3aNiger 0aDisaster risk reduction 0aEnvironmental justice 0aFlood damage 0aLand cover change 0aSettlement dynamics1 aGalligari, Andrea1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1660-58590 tLand use policy.g2021 Sept., v. 108 p.105547-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12412x0264-83777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2021.1055473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02108naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245017100166300001800337520064700355592002801002650001301030650002701043650001101070650002901081650002301110650001401133650001001147650004301157650001301200650004401213700002501257700001701282700002601299700002301325700002301348700001901371700002401390700002101414700002701435773010601462856008501568852000901653655001201662IND60579148020180316000000.0170816e20160715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057914802DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.6b014372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Huijuan10aPseudoxylallemycins A–F, Cyclic Tetrapeptides with Rare Allenyl Modifications Isolated from Pseudoxylaria sp.

Pseudoxylallemycins B–D (2–4) possess a rare and chemically accessible allene moiety amenable for synthetic modifications, and derivatives A–D showed antimicrobial activity against Gram-negative human-pathogenic Pseudomonas aeruginosa and antiproliferative activity against human umbilical vein endothelial cells and K-562 cell lines.  aPublisher supplied data 3aIsoptera 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aallene 3aantimicrobial properties 3achemical reactions 3acultivars 3afungi 3ahuman umbilical vein endothelial cells 3amoieties 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy1 aKreuzenbeck, Nina B.1 aOtani, Saria1 aGarcia-Altares, Maria1 aDahse, Hans-Martin1 aWeigel, Christiane1 aAanen, Duur K.1 aHertweck, Christian1 aPoulsen, Michael1 aBeemelmanns, Christine0 tOrganic letters.g2016 July 15, v. 18, no. 14 p.3338-3341dAmerican Chemical Societyx1523-70527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.orglett.6b014373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03717naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245014500168300001600313520190400329592002802233650003402261650002602295650002902321650002502350650001702375650002402392650002902416650001502445650001202460650002302472650000902495650002302504650003702527650001402564650001302578650001302591650001402604650001502618650001302633650004402646653002202690653002502712653002202737653004302759700001802802700001802820700001902838700002002857700001802877700002102895700001902916773009602935856008703031852000903118655001203127IND60566515820221119181413.0190408e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056651582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodcont.2017.03.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVan Ba, Hoa10aEffects of extraction methods of shiitake by-products on their antioxidant and antimicrobial activities in fermented sausages during storage  ap. 109-118.  aTwo different solvents (water and ethanol/water at 50/50 ratio) were used for extraction of phenolic contents in shiitake by-products, and the antioxidant and antimicrobial efficacies of fermented sausages incorporated with these two extracts were investigated during storage. Also, shelf-life stability of fermented sausages fortified with these two extracts was compared with those fortified with BHT (0.02%) or nitrite (0.01%)/nitrate (0.005%). Significantly higher antioxidant activities (e.g., ferrous ion chelating and DPPH scavenging) and inhibitory capacity against lipid oxidation (e.g., TBARS reduction) were observed in the fermented sausages made with ethanolic extract (shiitake by-products extracted with ethanol/water) compared with those added with aqueous extract (extracted with water) or BHT, nitrite/nitrate and control throughout storage. The ethanolic extract treated-samples also showed a significantly slower increasing rate of total aerobic count (6.54–6.95 log10 cfu/g) than the ones treated with aqueous extract (6.74–7.16 log10 cfu/g) during storage. Otherwise, extract obtained from the ethanolic extract treated-samples had stronger antimicrobial activities against pathogens than the one obtained from aqueous extract treated-samples (e.g., minimum inhibitory concentrations, MIC = 2.05 & 3.64, 3.12 & 5.20 and 7.29 & 10.41 mg/mL for S. aureus, L. monocytogenes and E. coli O157, respectively). Especially, the antimicrobial activity against S. typhimurium (MIC = 37.50 mg/mL) was observed only in the extract of ethanolic extract treated-samples. Our study demonstrates that the extraction with ethanol/water solvent is a more effective method to obtain bioactive compounds enriched-extract which better improved the shelf-life stability of fermented sausages during storage without defects in quality in comparison to the extraction method with water.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aEscherichia coli O157 3aantimicrobial properties 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3abioactive compounds 3abutylated hydroxytoluene 3abyproducts 3aethanol 3afermented sausages 3airon 3alipid peroxidation 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3amushrooms 3anitrates 3anitrites 3apathogens 3ashelf life 3asolvents 3athiobarbituric acid-reactive substances 0aFermented sausage 0aShiitake by-products 0aExtraction method 0aAntioxidant and antimicrobial activity1 aSeo, Hyun-Woo1 aCho, Soo-Hyun1 aKim, Yoon-Seok1 aKim, Jin-Hyoung1 aHam, Jun-Sang1 aPark, Beom-Young1 aPil-Nam, Seong0 tFood control.g2017 Sept., v. 79 p.109-118dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl56242x0956-71357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2017.03.0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02675naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245012700167520136200294592002801656650002001684650003401704650001401738650002201752650002301774650002401797650001601821653002801837653002601865653002401891653004301915653003901958653003701997700001802034700005302052773009002105856008502195852000902280655001202289IND60759652120221117062859.0220205e20220215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075965212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2021.1228792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Jufeng10aLithium-ion battery capacity estimation based on battery surface temperature change under constant-current charge scenario  aAccurate estimation of battery actual capacity in real time is crucial for a reliable battery management system and the safety of electrical vehicles. In this paper, the battery capacity is estimated based on the battery surface temperature change under constant-current charge scenario. Firstly, the evolution of the smoothed differential thermal voltammetry (DTV) curves throughout the aging process is analyzed. Then, the change of the battery surface temperature, which is equivalent to the area under the DTV curve, over a specific voltage range is introduced as a direct feature of interest to reflect the battery actual capacity. In addition, the temperature variation transformation is utilized to reduce the influence of the initial battery inconsistency. Lastly, two battery degradation datasets are utilized to validate the proposed method. The maximum root mean-square errors of the estimation results by the reference correlation are less than 20 mAh and 60 mAh for the two employed batteries (respective nominal capacities are 740 mAh and 4800 mAh). Specifically, the mean estimation errors for the respective two batteries are reduced by approximately 24.74% and 39.60% after the temperature variation transformation. The proposed method is further compared with the existing DTV analysis method and demonstrates the superior performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3aelectric potential difference 3aevolution 3alithium batteries 3amanagement systems 3asurface temperature 3avoltammetry 0aElectric vehicles (EVs) 0aLithium-ion batteries 0aCapacity estimation 0aDifferential thermal voltammetry (DTV) 0aBattery surface temperature change 0aTemperature curve transformation1 aCai, Yingfeng1 aMi, Chris1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5471-89530 tEnergy.g2022 Feb. 15, v. 241 p.122879-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2021.1228793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01450naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002300149245007500172300001800247520048500265592002800750650002300778650002300801650001500824650001600839650001400855650002300869700002500892700001900917773010600936856008501042852000901127655001201136IND60579148120180316000000.0170816e20160715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057914812DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.6b014382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBurglova, Kristyna10aEfficient Route to Deuterated Aromatics by the Deamination of Anilines  ap. 3342-3345.  aOne-step replacement of NH₂ groups in ring-substituted anilines by deuterium is reported.

However, kowledge related to gelation properties of emerging plant proteins is still limited. In this paper, the solubility, the thermal behaviour and gelation behaviour of pea protein were analysed. Gels were analysed rheologically measuring the elastic modulus G′₂₅°C, the ratio of G′₂₅°C to G′₉₅°C, and dependence on frequency and amplitude. In addition, the stabilizing protein interactions within the gel were analysed. The stiffest gels were obtained at pH 4.5 at 0.6 M NaCl. The high G′₂₅°C and low tan δ value indicate the inclusion of active fillers, which is proposed to be insoluble protein. Salt addition at acidic pH could protect the protein from acid denaturation leading to a low heat denaturation at 62 °C–68 °C compared to heat denaturation at neutral pH. Addition of salt at pH 3 also led to a stiffer gel with a lower G′₂₅ °C/G′₉₅°C ratio, which indicates more hydrophobic and covalent interactions. An increase in ionic strength at pH 7 and pH 9 led to an increase of denaturation temperature above gelation temperature and an increase of electrostatic interactions. At pH 9 at ionic strenghts of 0.9 M NaCl and 1.5 M NaCl the frequency sweep showed that an entangled solution was formed, instead of a gel. It was observed that pea protein gelation were more influenced by the ionic strength at low pH values compared to neutral or alkaline pH.  aPublisher supplied data 3adenaturation 3agelatinization temperature 3agelation 3agels 3aheat 3ahydrocolloids 3ahydrophobicity 3aionic strength 3amodulus of elasticity 3apH 3apea protein 3arheology 3asolubility 3athermal properties 0aPea protein 0aGelation 0aProtein interaction 0aRheology 0apH 0aNaCl1 aMüller, Michaela,1 aAndlinger, David1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3255-99711 aKulozik, Ulrich0 tFood hydrocolloids.g2022 Feb., v. 123 p.106903-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46643x0268-005X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodhyd.2021.1069033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02985naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002200164245009900186300001600285500001500301520165200316592002801968650002501996650001602021650001902037650002702056650002602083650002202109650004302131650001202174650002302186650002702209650001102236650001502247650001402262650002102276650002602297653001802323700002202341700002202363773008502385856004802470852000902518655001202527IND4469163720221120021603.0120614e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446916372DNAL7 a222189422pmid7 a10.1007/s00442-011-2241-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLe Guigo, Pauline10aPlant neighborhood influences colonization of Brassicaceae by specialist and generalist aphids  ap. 753-761.  a2019-12-06  aA plant’s own characteristics, but also those of its neighbors, might have an impact on its probability of being colonized by herbivorous insects. A plant might be less colonized and experience associational resistance when it grows near repellent neighbors. In contrast, it might be more colonized and experience associational susceptibility near attractive neighbors. To date, mechanisms that drive associational defense are not really understood. In order to gain insights into the occurrence of associational resistance versus associational susceptibility under field conditions, we conducted an experiment to determine the influence of neighboring plants on the colonization of a focal plant by aphids. The focal plant was always Brassica oleracea. The neighbors were B. oleracea (control), B. napus, B. nigra, or Solanum lycopersicum, which represent contrasting levels of physical and chemical defenses. The focal plant, B. oleracea, was more colonized by the specialist aphid Brevicoryne brassicae, and experienced associational susceptibility when it was surrounded by B. nigra or B. napus. In contrast, B. oleracea was less colonized by the generalist aphid Myzus persicae, and experienced associational resistance when it was surrounded by S. lycopersicum, B. nigra or B. napus. Neighboring plants had no significant impact on host plant choice by the generalist aphid Macrosiphum euphorbiae. In conclusion, attraction or repulsion of the specialist aphid B. brassicae and the generalist aphid M. persicae by B. nigra, B. napus, and S. lycopersicum resulted in associational susceptibility or associational resistance for B. oleracea.  aPublisher supplied data 3aphytophagous insects 3ahost plants 3aMyzus persicae 3aMacrosiphum euphorbiae 3aBrevicoryne brassicae 3aBrassica oleracea 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 2aAnimals 2aAphidsxphysiology 2aBrassicaxparasitology 2aFemale 2aFood Chain 2aHerbivory 2aHost Specificity 2aSolanum lycopersicum. 0aneighborhoods1 aRolier, Alexandre1 aLe Corff, Josiane0 tOecologia.g2012 July, v. 169, no. 3 p.753-761dSpringer-Verlagx0029-85497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-011-2241-4  aDNAL 7aarticle02220naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245013700173300001600310520126200326592002801588650002501616650001401641650001201655650002401667700002901691773009701720856008101817990002301898852000901921655001201930IND60093102720221118052918.0141103e20120401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009310272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cej.2012.01.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKostoglou, Margaritis12aA mathematical study of the evolution of fouling and operating parameters throughout membrane sheets comprising spiral wound modules  ap. 222-231.  aLocal experimental data on key process parameters, throughout membrane sheets of spiral-wound membrane (SWM) elements, are unavailable and very difficult to obtain; therefore, theoretical models are essential to better understand the evolution of fouling, which is helpful for improving design and operation of these modules. The mathematical model, formulated in a fundamental manner herein, takes into account the spatial flow field non-uniformities inside narrow channels with spacers (simulating SWM elements) and their interaction with the evolving deposits. A realistic meso-scale transient model, typical of the early stages of organic membrane fouling, is employed. Appropriate non-dimensionalization of model equations allows to treat separately the two (practically significant) cases of constant inlet pressure and constant average permeate flux. Several simplified cases are examined, for specific dimensionless parameter values, and asymptotic solutions are derived.

Electrophysiological and behavioral responses of P. xylostella to green leaf volatiles (GLVs) alone or together with its female sex pheromone were investigated in laboratory and field. GLVs 1-hexanol and (Z)-3-hexen-1-ol elicited strong electroantennographic responses from unmated male and female P. xylostella, whereas (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate only produced a relatively weak response. The behavioral responses of unmated moths to GLVs were further tested in Y-tube olfactometer experiments. (E)-2-Hexenal, (Z)-3-hexen-1-ol, and (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate induced attraction of males, reaching up to 50%, significantly higher than the response to the unbaited control arm. In field experiments conducted in 2008 and 2009, significantly more moths were captured in traps baited with synthetic sex pheromone with either (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate alone or a blend of (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate, (Z)-3-hexen-1-ol, and (E)-2-hexenal compared with sex pheromone alone and other blend mixtures. These results demonstrated that GLVs could be used to enhance the attraction of P. xylostella males to sex pheromone-baited traps. 3avolatile compounds 3aacetates 3ainsect pests 3aelectroantennography 3amoths 3asex pheromones 3abait traps 3amales 3aolfactometers 3asex determination analysis 3aPlutella xylostella 3apheromone traps 3aBrassicaceae 3afield experimentation 3afemales 3aleaves 0asexing1 aZhu, Junwei1 aQin, Yuchuan0 tJournal of economic entomology.g2012, v. 105, no. 4 p.1149-1156dEntomological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl46276x1938-291X7nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/558793Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603/EC11109  aARIS submissionbhttp://submit.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/Enhanced%20Attraction%20of%20Plutella%20xylostella%20%28Lepidopter%20Plutellidae%29%20to%20Pheromone-Baited%20Traps%20with%20the%20Addition%20of%20Green%20Leaf%20Volatiles.pdf  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle03762naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245009200172300001100264520154200275592002801817596003701845596003701882596004501919596004501964596004502009596009902054596011002153596011002263596009502373596010002468650003702568650001102605650001002616650000902626650001102635650001202646650001002658650002402668651001102692700002802703700002602731700002802757700002502785700002402810700003102834700001702865700002602882700001802908700006302926773011502989856008303104852000903187655001203196IND60734285020221119054809.0220301e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073428502DNAL7 a10.1186/s13567-021-00929-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarín-Moreno, Alba10aClassical scrapie in small ruminants is caused by at least four different prion strains  ap. 57.  aThe diversity of goat scrapie strains in Europe has recently been studied using bioassays in a wide collection of rodent models, resulting in the classification of classical scrapie into four different categories. However, the sole use of the first passage does not lead to isolate adaptation and identification of the strains involved and might therefore lead to misclassification of some scrapie isolates. Therefore, this work reports the complete transmission study of a wide collection of goat transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) isolates by intracranial inoculation in two transgenic mouse lines overexpressing either small ruminant (TgGoat-ARQ) or bovine (TgBov) PrPC. To compare scrapie strains in sheep and goats, sheep scrapie isolates from different European countries were also included in the study. Once the species barrier phenomenon was overcome, an accurate classification of the isolates was attained. Thus, the use of just two rodent models allowed us to fully differentiate at least four different classical scrapie strains in small ruminants and to identify isolates containing mixtures of strains. This work reinforces the idea that classical scrapie in small ruminants is a prion disease caused by multiple different prion strains and not by a single strain, as is the case for epidemic classical bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE-C). In addition, the clear dissimilarity between the different scrapie strains and BSE-C does not support the idea that classical scrapie is the origin of epidemic BSE-C.  aPublisher supplied data  aFOOD-CT-2006-36353 [GoatBSE]cEU  aFOOD-CT-2006-36353 [GoatBSE]cEU  a219235 ERA-NET EMIDA [GOAT-TSE-FREE]cEU  a219235 ERA-NET EMIDA [GOAT-TSE-FREE]cEU  a219235 ERA-NET EMIDA [GOAT-TSE-FREE]cEU  aAGL2009-11553-C02-02cMinisterio de Economía, Industria y Competitividad, Gobierno de España  aAGL2016-78054-R (AEI/FEDER, UE)cMinisterio de Economía, Industria y Competitividad, Gobierno de España  aAGL2016-78054-R (AEI/FEDER, UE)cMinisterio de Economía, Industria y Competitividad, Gobierno de España  aBES-2010- 040922cMinisterio de Economía, Industria y Competitividad, Gobierno de España  aINIA-FPI-SGIT-2015-02cInstituto Nacional de Investigación y Tecnología Agraria y Alimentaria 3abovine spongiform encephalopathy 3acattle 3agoats 3amice 3aprions 3ascrapie 3asheep 3aveterinary medicine 3aEurope1 aAguilar-Calvo, Patricia1 aEspinosa, Juan Carlos1 aZamora-Ceballos, María1 aPitarch, José Luis,1 aGonzález, Lorenzo,1 aFernández-Borges, Natalia1 aOrge, Leonor1 aAndréoletti, Olivier1 aNonno, Romolo1 aTorres, Juan María1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0443-92320 tBMC veterinary research.g2021 Dec., v. 52, no. 1 p.57-57dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4152735x1297-97167nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13567-021-00929-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02645naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245011900159300001600278520107800294592002801372650002601400650003001426650002201456650001301478650001501491650002901506650001701535650001001552650001101562650001801573650001601591650001901607650001801626650001901644650002401663650001401687650002201701700002401723700002001747700002301767700001801790700002201808700002001830700002001850700002001870773015301890856007502043852000902118655001202127IND60549814920221116181509.0160909e20150424xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054981492DNAL7 a10.1021/np500856u2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, Rohitesh10aDesign and Synthesis of a Screening Library Using the Natural Product Scaffold 3-Chloro-4-hydroxyphenylacetic Acid  ap. 914-918.  aThe fungal metabolite 3-chloro-4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (1) was utilized in the generation of a unique drug-like screening library using parallel solution-phase synthesis. A 20-membered amide library (3–22) was generated by first converting 1 to methyl (3-chloro-4-hydroxyphenyl)acetate (2), then reacting this scaffold with a diverse series of primary amines via a solvent-free aminolysis procedure. The structures of the synthetic analogues (3–22) were elucidated by spectroscopic data analysis. The structures of compounds 8, 12, and 22 were confirmed by single X-ray crystallographic analysis. All compounds were evaluated for cytotoxicity against a human prostate cancer cell line (LNCaP) and for antiparasitic activity toward Trypanosoma brucei brucei and Plasmodium falciparum and showed no significant activity at 10 μM. The library was also tested for effects on the lipid content of LNCaP and PC-3 prostate cancer cells, and it was demonstrated that the fluorobenzyl analogues (12–14) significantly reduced cellular phospholipid and neutral lipid levels.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPlasmodium falciparum 3aTrypanosoma brucei brucei 3aX-ray diffraction 3aacetates 3aaminolysis 3aantiparasitic properties 3acytotoxicity 3afungi 3ahumans 3alipid content 3ametabolites 3aneoplasm cells 3aphospholipids 3aprimary amines 3aprostatic neoplasms 3ascreening 3aspectral analysis1 aSadowski, Martin

Pyrolysis-comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GCxGC/MS) has been applied for the first time for the characterization of a valuable archaeological lacquer sample confirming the benefits of this technique for the description of the ingredients used in the formulation of the lacquer coating. Besides, the analytical results also showed that, in accordance with what is suspected from the lacquer technique employed at this period, two lacquer film layers and a bone-derived ground layer were present as confirmed by the characterization of hydroxyapatite particles (Ca₅(PO₄)₃OH) of different sizes. Py-GC/MS analysis allowed identification of the origin of the scabbard lacquer as a Toxicodendron vernicifluum lacquer and detection of potential drying oil markers, while Py-GCxGC/MS analysis revealed the presence of a series of polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) compounds non-characterizable by 1D GC/MS analysis. This latter observation highlights the use of soot attributed to a plant origin in conjunction with bone for the manufacture and coloring of the lacquers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aToxicodendron vernicifluum 3aX-radiation 3aarchaeology 3acomprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography 3ahydroxyapatite 3amanufacturing 3aoils 3apyrolysis gas chromatography 3asoot 3aChina 0aBa ethnic group 0aLijiaba site 0aLacquer scabbard 0aAsian lacquer 0aToxicodendron vernicifluum 0aPy-GCxGC/MS 0aPAHs characterization1 aFan, Xiaopan1 aChen, Yun1 aGao, Jie1 aSablier, Michel0 tJournal of archaeological science: Reports.g2022 Apr., v. 42 p.103416-dElsevier LtdwJournal:26843x2352-409X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jasrep.2022.1034163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02499naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002500139245008900164300001600253520125100269592002801520650002501548650001501573650001801588650001701606650001201623650001301635650002101648650004401669650001301713650001201726650001501738700001701753700001401770700002401784700002601808700001801834773015301852856007502005852000902080655001202089IND60549815020221116181900.0160909e20150424xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054981502DNAL7 a10.1021/np500866c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNguyen, Phuong
Q. T.10aAllotides: Proline-Rich Cystine Knot α-Amylase Inhibitors from Allamanda cathartica  ap. 695-704.  aCystine knot α-amylase inhibitors belong to a knottin family of peptidyl inhibitors of 30–32 residues and contain two to four prolines. Thus far, only four members of the group of cystine knot α-amylase inhibitors have been characterized. Herein, the discovery and characterization of five cystine knot α-amylase inhibitors, allotides C1–C5 (Ac1–Ac5) (1–5), from the medicinal plant Allamanda cathartica are reported using both proteomic and genomic methods. Proteomic analysis showed that 1–5 are 30 amino acids in length with three or four proline residues. NMR determination of 4 revealed that it has two cis- and one trans-proline residues and adopts two equally populated conformations in solution. Determination of disulfide connectivity of 2 by differential S-reduction and S-alkylation provided clues of its unfolding process. Genomic analysis showed that allotide precursors contain a three-domain arrangement commonly found in plant cystine knot peptides with conserved residues flanking the processing sites of the mature allotide domain. This work expands the number of known cystine knot α-amylase inhibitors and furthers the understanding of both the structural and biological diversity of this type of knottin family.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAllamanda cathartica 3aalkylation 3aalpha-amylase 3abiodiversity 3acystine 3agenomics 3amedicinal plants 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apeptides 3aproline 3aproteomics1 aLuu, Thuy T.1 aBai, Yang1 aNguyen, Giang K.

Adequate food skills may improve diet quality and prevent chronic disease. Research is limited, however, on students' food skills and food-related behaviors. The objective of this study was to assess whether self-perceived food skills and related behaviors of students at a large, Canadian university differed based on sex, having taken a Food and Nutrition (FN) course, and living conditions, using a cross-sectional online survey. The response rate was 21.9% (n = 6638). Students (age, M ± SD 19.9 ± 2.1 years) self-reported their abilities for seven distinct food skills. Students rated (out of 100) their ability for some skills significantly higher than others (79.7 ± 20.9 for peeling, chopping, and slicing vs. 56.1 ± 29.1 for weekly meal planning; p < 0.001). Females reported higher total food skill scores than males (487.0 ± 141.1 out of a possible 700 vs. 441.9 ± 151.8, respectively; p < 0.001). Respondents who had taken a FN course reported higher total food skill scores than those who had not (494.9 ± 137.0 vs. 461.9 ± 149.2; p < 0.001). Students who resided away from their parental home for longer than one year reported significantly higher total food skill scores than those living away for one year or less (488.9 ± 134.6 vs. 443.3 ± 153.0, respectively; p < 0.001). Results indicate that students' self-perceived food skills vary by sex, FN education, and living condition. Higher abilities were reported for mechanical food skills; conceptual skills were significantly lower. These results may assist in effectively targeting this population with nutrition education interventions.  aPublisher supplied data 3achopping 3achronic diseases 3acollege students 3afemales 3amales 3ameal planning 3anutrition education 3anutritional adequacy 3apeeling 3aslicing 3asurveys 3aweight gain 0aFood skills 0aStudents 0aNutrition education 0aSurvey1 aMatthews, June I.1 aSeabrook, Jamie A.1 aDworatzek, Paula D.N.0 tAppetite.g2017 Jan. 01, v. 108 p.270-276dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl31756x0195-66637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2016.10.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02337naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245011000164300001600274500001900290520104700309592002801356650002401384650001301408650002601421650001201447650002201459650002501481650002001506650002501526650001101551650001101562650001601573700002801589700001901617700001801636700001601654700001901670773013601689856008101825852000901906655001201915IND60650499920221119031835.0190710e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065049992DNAL7 a10.1017/S00218596160006662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGHORBANI, M.14aThe effect of lime pre-treatments of date palm leaves on delignification and in vitro rumen degradability  ap. 184-190.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aExperiments were conducted to determine the effect of lime pre-treatment on the chemical composition and in vitro rumen degradability of date palm leaves (DPL). Lime pre-treatments, with or without oxygen supply, were applied for 1, 2 and 3 weeks at 25 and 40 °C. Lime was neutralized by the Calcium-Capturing-by-Carbonation process. Delignification and in vitro rumen gas production were significantly influenced by duration, temperature and oxygen. At 40 °C, oxygen presence stimulated more delignification and subsequently increased in vitro rumen degradability. Lime pre-treatment with 0·2 g calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)₂)/g dry biomass for 3 weeks at 40 °C in the presence of oxygen resulted in a 3-fold increase in gas production after 24 h of incubation, compared with untreated biomass. Lime treatment of DPL with aeration resulted in higher lignin removal and subsequent rumen degradability than without aeration. A techno-economic analysis is needed to select the most efficient and economically feasible pre-treatment procedure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhoenix dactylifera 3aaeration 3aagricultural sciences 3abiomass 3acalcium hydroxide 3achemical composition 3adelignification 3aeconomic feasibility 3alignin 3aoxygen 3atemperature1 aAḥmadī, Faraj Allah,1 aRAJAEE RAD, A.1 aZAMIRI, M.

However, intensification demands increased inputs, such as fish and feed per unit culture area and, therefore, increased waste generation from the aquaculture production systems. The impact of waste products from aquaculture has increased public concern and threatens the sustainability of aquaculture practices. The need for increasing the production of aquaculture products cannot be overemphasized and, therefore, there is a need to develop culture systems that will increase fish production with efficient waste management in order to limit environmental degradation resulting from aquaculture wastes and ensure its sustainability. This paper reviewed various aspects of waste production from aquaculture, their sources, components, and methods of management, in different culture systems, primarily discussing waste production from feed, chemicals, and pathogens. We aimed to establish the sources of wastes, their contents, and potential harms to both the fish culture and the environment. Suggestions for managing wastes in different culture systems were made to ensure an improved and sustainable aquaculture production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenvironmental degradation 3afish 3afish culture 3afish production 3anatural resources 3apathogens 3aproduction technology 3awaste management 3awastes 0aFish farming 0aAquaculture effluents 0aEnvironmental degradation 0aWaste management 0aSustainable aquaculture1 aAjadi, Abdullateef1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3948-671X1 aTola-Fabunmi, Adenike Susan1 aAkinwole, Ayoola Olusegun0 tAquaculture and fisheries.g2019 May, v. 4, no. 3 p.81-88dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23559x2468-550X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aaf.2018.10.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02598naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245008400169300001600253520130000269592002801569650004401597650002201641650001101663650000901674650001101683650001101694650001301705650004401718650001901762650001801781650001901799650002001818650002101838650002401859650002301883700002501906700002001931700002701951773009301978856008402071852000902155655001202164IND60098896020221117090610.0141105e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009889602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fuproc.2013.05.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNaktiyok, Jale10aKinetics of thermal decomposition of phospholipids obtained from phosphate rock  ap. 158-164.  aThe soluble organic matter in the phosphate rock was extracted with n-hexane. Its structure was analyzed by using ¹H NMR, ¹³C NMR and FTIR. ¹H NMR and ¹³C NMR studies indicated that it has rather aliphatic nature. FTIR results showed that the bands obtained from organic matter exhibit a phospholipids characteristic. The kinetics of thermal decomposition of phospholipids obtained from phosphate rock was studied by means of thermal analysis techniques (TG/DTG) in nitrogen atmosphere at heating rates of 2.5, 5, 10, and 20Kmin⁻¹. TG and DTG measurements indicated that thermal behavior of phospholipids has two-stage degradation. Kinetic parameters were determined from the TG and DTG curves for the stages I and II by using two model-free methods, i.e. Flynn–Wall–Ozawa and Kissinger–Akahira–Sunose. The kinetic triplets consisting of Eₐ, A and g(α) models of the materials were determined. The average activation energies (Eₐ) obtained from both models for the decomposition of phospholipids are 64.15kJ/mol and 122.3kJ/mol and the pre-exponential factors ln(A) were 15.8 and 20.4 for stages I and II, respectively. The decomposition of phospholipids proceeds by two-dimensional diffusion (D₂) for stage I, followed by three-dimensional diffusion (D₅) for stage II.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aactivation energy 3acarbon 3aheat 3ahexane 3amodels 3anitrogen 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aorganic matter 3aphospholipids 3arock phosphate 3astable isotopes 3athermal analysis 3athermal degradation 3athermal properties1 aBayrakçeken, Hatice1 aÖzer, A.

Target analytes include polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), pesticides, chlorobenzenes, brominated and chlorinated flame retardants, nitro-aromatic and polycyclic musks, triclosan and methyl triclosan. Spike-recovery experiments showed relative recoveries of analytes were generally between 70% and 130%. Analyses of a sediment standard reference material (SRM 1944) demonstrated recoveries between 80% and 120% for certified concentrations of individual PCBs and pesticides. Method detection limits of individual compounds ranged from 0.1 to 57.1pg/g dw for sediments and 0.1 to 22.8pg/g ww for biota. A field survey of sediments and biota from Singapore's marine environment demonstrated the occurrence of polycyclic and nitro-aromatic musks (galaxolide, tonalide, musk ketone, etc.), halogenated flame retardants (syn- and anti-dechlorane plus (DP), α, β and γ-hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD), tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA), etc.), as well as triclosan and methyl triclosan. Galaxolide exhibited relatively high concentrations, with highest levels in polychaete worms (161.7±72.5ng/g ww) and clams (546.8±220.3ng/g ww) from mangroves. Triclosan and methyl triclosan levels were highly correlated in sediments (r2=0.9752), while syn- and anti-DP were strongly correlated in biota (r2=0.9279). anti-DP/syn-DP stereoisomer ratios were typically >1 and ranged between 0.94 and 29.2 in sediments and biota samples. γ-HBCD exhibited the highest concentrations among HBCD isomers in sediments. Conversely, α-HBCD was the dominant HBCD isomer in biota.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPolychaeta 3aclams 3agas chromatography 3ahexabromocyclododecane 3ahydrophobicity 3amarine environment 3amarine sediments 3amass spectrometry 3apesticides 3apolychlorinated biphenyls 3astereoisomers 3asurveys 3aSingapore 0aMulti-residue analysis 0aLegacy POPs 0aEmerging organic contaminants 0aGC-EI-MS/MS 0aLC-ESI-MS/MS 0aMarine biota 0aSediments1 aBayen, Stéphane1 aKelly, Barry C.0 tTalanta.g2015 Oct. 01, v. 143 p.7-18dElsevier B.V.x0039-91407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2015.04.0843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03027naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002800139245012300167520172100290592002802011650001302039650001702052650001302069650001102082650001202093650002202105650002202127650001402149650002902163650002202192650002802214650001302242650002402255650001602279650001902295650001902314650002402333650001002357700002102367773012302388856007302511852000902584655001202593IND60647872020221120235124.0190623e20180116xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064787202DNAL7 a10.3390/d100100042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPagnotta, Mario Augusto14aThe Contribution of Professor Gian Tommasso Scarascia Mugnozza to the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Biodiversity  aDuring his lifetime, Professor Scarascia Mugnozza contributed significantly to the field of population genetics, his research ranging from wheat breeding in arid and semi-arid regions, to the conservation of forest ecosystems. He promoted regional networks across the Mediterranean, linking science and policy at national and international levels, focusing on the conservation and sustainable use of genetic diversity. In addition, he worked intensely on improvement of knowledge bases, raising awareness on how research could inform international agreements, and thus lead to evidence-based policies. The loss of biodiversity and the resulting implications for environmental, socio-economic, political, and ethical management of plant genetic resources were of major concern, and he highlighted the absolute necessity for conservation of genetic diversity, stressing the importance of building positive feedback linkages among ex situ, in situ, on-farm conservation strategies, and participatory approaches at the community level. His work emphasized the importance of access to diverse plant genetic resources by researchers and farmers, and promoted equitable access to genetic resources through international frameworks. Farmers’ rights, especially those in centres of origin and diversity of cultivated plants, were a key concern for Professor Scarascia Mugnozza, as their access to germplasm needed to be secured as custodians of diversity and the knowledge of how to use these vital resources. Consequently, he promoted the development of North-South cooperation mechanisms and platforms, including technology transfer and the sharing of information of how to maintain and use genetic resources sustainably.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTriticum 3abiodiversity 3abreeding 3aethics 3afarmers 3aforest ecosystems 3agenetic variation 3agermplasm 3ainternational agreements 3aissues and policy 3aplant genetic resources 3apolitics 3apopulation genetics 3aresearchers 3asemiarid zones 3asocioeconomics 3atechnology transfer 3awheat1 aNoorani, Arshiya0 tDiversity.g2018 Jan. 16, v. 10, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21675x1424-28187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/d100100043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02981naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094024002200131024001900153040001800172100002100190245014900211300001600360506007600376520154200452592002801994506003702022650001202059650001202071650002402083650001602107650002502123650001102148650001002159653001902169653001702188653003002205653001802235653002202253653002202275700006202297773009502359856008402454852000902538655001202547IND60565122420221207075548.0190401e20170101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056512242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.appet.2016.10.0152doi7 aPMC51380792pmcid7 a277422372pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrosof, Leigh C.10aSocial appearance anxiety and dietary restraint as mediators between perfectionism and binge eating: A six month three wave longitudinal study  ap. 335-342.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBinge eating is related to perfectionism and restrained eating. However, the mechanisms underlying these relationships are not well understood. It is possible that social anxiety, specifically social appearance anxiety (i.e., the fear of overall appearance evaluation), influences the relationship between binge eating, perfectionism, and dietary restraint. In the current study (N = 300 women), we tested the relationship between dietary restraint, social appearance anxiety, concern over mistakes (a component of perfectionism), and binge eating in prospective data (three time points: at baseline, at two month, and at six month follow up). We found that social appearance anxiety, dietary restraint, and concern over mistakes each predicted binge eating at baseline. Only social appearance anxiety prospectively predicted binge eating when accounting for all variables. Further, in the tested model, social appearance anxiety mediated the relationship between concern over mistakes and binge eating across six months. On the contrary, dietary restraint did not mediate the relationship between concern over mistakes and binge eating in the tested model. The finding that social appearance anxiety served as a mediator between concern over mistakes and binge eating, but that dietary restraint did not, implies that social appearance anxiety may be a more salient prospective predictor of binge eating than dietary restraint. Intervening on social appearance anxiety may be important in the treatment and prevention of binge eating.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanxiety 3abinging 3adietary restriction 3afearfulness 3alongitudinal studies 3amodels 3awomen 0aSocial anxiety 0aBinge eating 0aSocial appearance anxiety 0aPerfectionism 0aDietary restraint 0aDisordered eating1 aLevinson, Cheri A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8098-69430 tAppetite.g2017 Jan. 01, v. 108 p.335-342dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl31756x0195-66637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2016.10.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03544naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005700148245014700205520183000352592002802182650002302210650001502233650002002248650001502268650001902283650001602302650001502318650001702333650001502350650001002365650001902375650001502394650001302409650002402422651001602446653002102462653002502483653002302508653002102531653001702552653002002569700002202589700002802611700002402639700002102663700003202684700005802716700002202774773011402796856008302910852000902993655001203002IND60770307720221116213319.0220719e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077030772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rsma.2022.1022642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBanan, Ashkan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1793-153310aSalinity gradients exacerbate the genotoxicity and bioaccumulation of silver nanoparticles in fingerling Persian sturgeon (Acipenser persicus)  aAs nanoparticles are extensively applied in a vast range of products and so are released into marine environments, their effects and the involved mechanisms on such ecosystems need to be further investigated. Therefore, the present study examined the effects of salinity on the toxicity of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) using DNA damage biomarker and bioaccumulation process in fingerling Persian sturgeon (Acipenser persicus). A total of 360 fingerling fish with an average weight of 2.95 ± 0.25, 3.49 ± 0.35 and 4.04 ± 0.35 were used for the salinity gradients of 0.4, 6 and 12 g L⁻¹ (ppt), respectively. Fish acclimated to freshwater (0.4 ppt) for 14 d were exposed to 0, 0.07, 0.1, and 0.2 mg L⁻¹ AgNPs, while those kept in brackish water (6 and 12 ppt) were exposed to 0, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.6 mg L⁻¹ AgNPs through a sub-chronic exposure test. Fish sampling was conducted on the day 0 and 14 and bioaccumulation and DNA damage tests were implemented using liver, gills and intestine organs. Results showed that AgNPs exposure could induce concentration-dependent DNA damage in the liver single cells, while elevating salinity significantly increased tail moment index in the fish. Ag bioaccumulation in the investigated tissues was greatest in liver, followed by gill, then intestine. Furthermore, elevated salinity significantly increased the bioaccumulation of Ag in the liver. Behavioral analysis showed the marked emergence of abnormal manners with the increase of salinity and AgNPs concentrations. Together, salinity changes, as one of the most important environmental stressors, can significantly affect the toxicity of emerging pollutants such as AgNPs in the marine biota, and ecologically- and commercially-important fish species like Persian sturgeon are in a cautious status in the Caspian Sea.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcipenser persicus 3aDNA damage 3abioaccumulation 3abiomarkers 3abrackish water 3afingerlings 3afreshwater 3agenotoxicity 3aintestines 3aliver 3amarine science 3ananosilver 3asalinity 3asubchronic exposure 3aCaspian Sea 0aSalinity changes 0aSilver nanoparticles 0aAcipenser persicus 0aEcological model 0aGenotoxicity 0aBioaccumulation1 aForouharmehr, Ali1 aKalbassi, Mohammad Reza1 aEsmaeilbeigi, Milad1 aBahmani, Mahmoud1 aYazdani Sadati, Mohammadali1 aKolok, Alan S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1585-60341 aRogan, Eleanor G.0 tRegional studies in marine science.g2022 May, v. 52 p.102264-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23214x2352-48557nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rsma.2022.1022643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03349naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002700153245009000180300001800270520213500288592002802423650002202451650001802473650001102491650001502502650001802517650001802535650001102553650000902564650001702573650001402590650001002604650001402614650001002628650001602638650001602654700002302670700003102693773010502724856008902829852000902918655001202927IND60558800320221118172432.0161117e20161117xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055880032DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.6b017122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBin Dahbag, Mabkhot
S.10aEfficiency of Ionic Liquids as an Enhanced Oil Recovery Chemical: Simulation Approach  ap. 9260-9265.  aA significant portion of crude oil remains in the reservoir after the application of conventional recovery. To meet the growing demand of energy, enhanced oil recovery (EOR) methods should be used efficiently to recover the extra amount of trapped crude oil after secondary water flooding. Surfactant flooding is one of the chemical EOR methods that can be implemented to recover oil from the remaining oil in place. Ionic liquids (ILs), which are salts with a melting point beneath 100 °C, were considered as a prospective alternative to the surfactant because of their superiority in different points. In this paper, three flooding experiments using Berea sandstone samples were conducted using IL solution (commercially called Ammoeng 102) in different scenarios to check its recovery efficiency. In the first scenario, a core sample was saturated with crude oil up to irreducible water saturation (Swᵢᵣ) and then secondary flooded with brine. IL solution was followed in tertiary flooding mode. The second scenario was implemented by injecting a slug of IL solution [0.4 pore volume (PV)] chased with brine in the secondary flooding stage. Continuous secondary flooding with IL solution from the beginning to the end of experiment was used to carry out the third scenario. The experimental runs were simulated using the surfactant flood model (SFM) available in CMG STARS software. All three scenarios were successfully simulated, and a good match was obtained for oil recovery, well bottom-hole pressure, and imbibition relative permeability curves. Both simulation and experimental results proved the superiority of secondary continuous IL solution flooding, providing the highest oil recovery [71% original oil in place (OOIP)] compared to 64% OOIP for the secondary flooding of 0.4 PV IL solution slug. Tertiary IL solution flooding consequent to secondary water flood was able to recover 48% OOIP. Experimental contact angle measurements and the shift in relative permeability curves indicate that wettability alteration toward more water-wet characteristics is the main recovery mechanism for ionic liquid flooding.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputer software 3acontact angle 3aenergy 3aimbibition 3aionic liquids 3amelting point 3amodels 3aoils 3apermeability 3apetroleum 3asalts 3asandstone 3aslugs 3asurfactants 3awettability1 aHossain, M.

The commercially available alkaloid boldine (2) was used as the starting material for synthesis of various C-9 alkoxy analogues of N-methyllaurotetanine in order to gauge the effect of C-9 alkylation on affinity and selectivity at 5-HT₁A, 5-HT₂A, and 5-HT₇ receptors. Mitsunobu reactions were implemented in the alkylation steps leading to the analogues. Modest improvement in 5-HT₁A affinity was observed upon alkylation for most analogues. Thus, the C-9 hydroxy group of 1 is not critical for affinity to the 5-HT₁A receptor. Some analogues displayed high affinity for the 5-HT₇ receptor, comparable to N-methyllaurotetanine, with moderate selectivity vs 5-HT₁A and 5-HT₂A receptors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkaloids 3aalkylation 3aligands 3aserotonin receptors1 aHarding, Wayne W.0 tJournal of natural products.g2015 Apr. 24, v. 78, no. 4 p.722-729dAmerican Chemical Society and American Society of Pharmacognosyx1520-60257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fnp500893h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03069naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001900155245010800174300001800282520156300300592002801863650002301891650001101914650002601925650001301951650001001964650001101974650000701985650001501992650001102007650001102018650001802029650001502047651001002062653002302072653001102095653001302106653001402119700002502133700001902158700002002177700006002197700002002257700002902277700003002306700002302336773009302359856009002452852000902542655001202551IND60592183520221122122713.0201202e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059218352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2017.11.1332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aViers, Jerome,10aAre Cu isotopes a useful tool to trace metal sources and processes in acid mine drainage (AMD) context?  ap. 1071-1079.  aIn the South-West Europe (Iberian Pyrite Belt), acid mine drainage (AMD) processes are especially problematic because they affect the environmental quality of watersheds, restricting the use of surface water. Recent studies have shown that Cu isotopes are fractionated during the oxidative dissolution of primary sulfide minerals and could be used to trace metal cycling. However the chemistry of Cu in such environment is complex because Cu is redistributed within numerous secondary minerals and strongly dependent on the hydroclimatic conditions that control key parameters (pH, redox conditions). Finally, it remains difficult to compare the various field studies and deliver some strong general tendencies because of these changing conditions. For these reasons, concerted studies on Cu isotopes fractionation in waters impacted by AMD may help to reveal the sources and transport pathways of this important pollutant. To address this issue, we used a representative scenario of strong contamination by AMD in the Iberian Pyrite Belt (SW Spain), the Cobica River. The aim of our study is to measure the Cu isotopes signature in the waters (river, mine lake, water draining waste) of the small Cobica River system (Huelva, Spain), sampled during a short period (8 h) to avoid any change in the hydro-climatic conditions. This provided an instantaneous image of the isotopic Cu signature in a small mining systems and helped us to constrain both the processes affecting Cu isotopes and their use a potential tracer of metals in contaminated environments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacid mine drainage 3acopper 3aenvironmental quality 3aisotopes 3alakes 3amining 3apH 3apollutants 3apyrite 3arivers 3asurface water 3awatersheds 3aSpain 0aAcid mine drainage 0aCopper 0aIsotopes 0aWatershed1 aGrande, Jose Antonio1 aZouiten, Cyril1 aFreydier, Rémi1 aMasbou, Jérémy1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3063-18451 aValente, Teresa1 aTorre, Maria-Luisa de la1 aDestrigneville, Christine1 aPokrovsky, Oleg S.0 tChemosphere.g2018 Feb., v. 193 p.1071-1079dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2017.11.1333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03013naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001100150245010100161300001600262520184500278592002802123650001902151650001402170650001302184650001302197650002302210650001602233650001002249650001802259650001802277650001602295700001602311700002602327700002002353700001502373700001502388700001402403773009302417856008402510852000902594655001202603IND60098896320221117090205.0141105e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009889632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fuproc.2013.05.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAy, S.10aDesign studies for monolithic high temperature shift catalysts: Effect of operational parameters  ap. 175-181.  aIn this study, the performance of a commercial high temperature shift (HTS) catalyst has been investigated. The catalyst was a wash-coated ceramic monolith type and used to adjust the H₂/CO ratio in a simulated syngas stream. In the experiments, the effects of inlet gas composition, gas hourly space velocity, inlet steam to CO ratio and reaction temperature have been investigated. The results showed that all these parameters have considerable influence on the design of HTS reactor. Precious metal based monolith catalysts enable working under high space velocities and thus reduce the volume of HTS reactor. Specifically defined selectivity, as ratio of the total amount of CO₂ and H₂ to the amount of CO₂ formed during the process, seems to be a good measure of possible unwanted side reactions that might occur. It was found that the selectivity ratio should be ideally about two for HTS process, minimizing the formation of side reactions. Selectivity values below 2.0 indicate the presence of unbalanced H₂ which is incompatible with WGS reaction stoichiometry. Results showed that steam is an effective parameter in determining the probability of side reactions, especially the reactions leading to the catalyst deactivation through coke deposition. Another point is that coking tendency of the catalyst is more severe at lower operating temperatures. The formation of methane, an unwanted by-product, was seen to be favored by lower gas hourly space velocities, possibly via the reaction with H₂. The formation of methane results in hydrogen consumption to some extent and consequently alters the product composition. The optimum operating conditions of the wash-coated monolith type HTS catalyst studied were found to be as follows: Temperature=~375–400°C, GHSV=~50,000h⁻¹ and the inlet steam to CO ratio=~2.0.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3acatalysts 3aceramics 3ahydrogen 3amethane production 3aprobability 3asteam 3astoichiometry 3asynthesis gas 3atemperature1 aAtakül, H.1 aÖzyönüm, G.

A QTL for a primary immune response towards keyhole lymphet heamocyanin has been detected on chicken chromosome 14 in three populations. The results from the most recent population were inconsistent and varied depending on the applied QTL detection model. The major goal of the current study was the reanalysis of this data using a 2 QTL model. Additionally, in order to provide more accurate estimates of QTL effects and positions, epistasis between the QTL was considered as a potential important contributor to quantitative traits. Four statistical models were assumed: M1: A model assuming marginal additive effects of two QTL; M2: A model assuming marginal and epistatic additive effects of two QTL; M3: A model assuming marginal additive and dominance effects of two QTL; M4: A model assuming marginal additive and dominance effects of two QTL and all possible pairwise epistases. Two QTL with significant additive and dominance effects were detected on chicken chromosome 14 using model M3. One QTL was detected at 63 cM between MCW0123 and ROS0005, another at 76 cM between ROS0005 and MCW0225/NTN2Lsts1 (FDR = 0.0051). Modelling only additive effects resulted in a significantly worse fit. On the other hand, including epistatic effects did not improve fit significantly. The current study confirms previous reports of the QTL location on GGA14. A notable finding of this study is recognition of two closely related QTL for a keyhole lymphet heamocyanin response at the distal part of chicken chromosome 14.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadditive effect 3achickens 3achromosomes 3aimmune response 3aquantitative trait loci 3aquantitative traits 3astatistical models 2aAnimals 2aAntibody Formation 2aChickensxgeneticsximmunology. 2aChromosomesxgenetics 2aCrosses, Genetic 2aDNAxanalysisxgenetics. 2aEpistasis, Genetic 2aFemale 2aHemocyaninsxgeneticsximmunology. 2aLinear Models 2aMale 2aMicrosatellite Repeats 2aPhenotype 2aQuantitative Trait Loci1 aSzyda, Joanna1 aSławińska, Anna,1 aBednarczyk, Marek0 tJournal of applied genetics.g2012 Feb., v. 53, no. 1 p.115-119dSpringer-Verlagx1234-19837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13353-011-0074-9  aDNAL 7aarticle02779naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002800140245014300168300001800311520130600329592002801635650004401663650002201707650001701729650002201746650001401768650001201782650002301794650001001817650001601827650001801843650002201861650002201883650001601905650001401921650001901935650001801954650001401972650003301986650003702019700002202056700001802078773013002096856007402226852000902300655001202309IND60616489520221121051348.0181017e20180920xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061648952DNAL7 a10.1039/c8ay01452c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBabu Christus, A. Anand10aNovel, sensitive and selective colorimetric detection of arsenate in aqueous solution by a Fenton-like reaction of Fe₃O₄ nanoparticles  ap. 4378-4386.  aIn this paper, we present a novel colorimetric sensor for the detection of arsenate in aqueous solution. Magnetic nanoparticles (Fe₃O₄ NPs) prepared by a hydrothermal process were characterized by SEM, XRD, FT-IR, and VSM analysis. The Fenton-like catalytic reaction of Fe₃O₄ NPs promoted the oxidation of methylene blue indicator (MB) in the presence of H₂O₂ which resulted in the diminishing of the dark blue colour of the solution, due to generation of ·OH radicals in the solution. This can be viewed by the naked eye and monitored by UV-Vis spectroscopy at 664 nm. Upon addition of arsenate to this system the blue colour regenerated in solution due to the agglomeration of As(v) on Fe₃O₄ which may block the active sites of the Fe₃O₄ NPs and decrease their intrinsic catalytic activity. Under optimal conditions, the proposed colorimetric sensor exhibited rapid and selective detection of As(v) in aqueous solution with a detection limit of 0.358 nM with a linear relationship with R² = 0.997. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report where arsenates can be detected colorimetrically by this sensing system (Fe₃O₄/MB/H₂O₂). The designed colorimetric strategy may provide a promising alternative method for detection of arsenates in real water samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aactive sites 3aaqueous solutions 3aarsenates 3aarsenic 3acatalytic activity 3acolor 3acolorimetry 3afree radicals 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ahydroxyl radicals 3airon oxides 3amagnetism 3amethylene blue 3ananoparticles 3aoxidation 3ascanning electron microscopy 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy1 aPanneerselvam, P.1 aRavikumar, A.0 tAnalytical methods.g2018 Sept. 20, v. 10, no. 36 p.4378-4386dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8ay01452c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03026naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245018800176300001400364520124000378592002801618650001101646650001201657650003501669650001201704650001101716650001101727650002001738650002001758650002601778650000901804650001401813650000901827650001501836650001101851650003301862650001901895650001401914650001701928650001301945650000901958650001401967653001801981653009001999653004902089653003302138700002102171700002502192700002202217700002202239700001802261773007502279856008502354852000902439655001202448IND60581468920221118065657.0171005e20151001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058146892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2015.04.0882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAzcarate, Silvana M.10aSingle-step solubilization of milk samples with N,N-dimethylformamide for inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry analysis and classification based on their elemental composition  ap. 64-70.  aA single-step procedure for trace elements analysis of milk samples is presented. Solubilization with small amounts of dymethylformamide (DMF) was assayed prior to inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICPMS) detection with a high efficiency sample introduction system. All main instrumental conditions were optimized in order to readily introduce the samples without matrix elimination. In order to assess and mitigate matrix effects in the determination of As, Cd, Co, Cu, Eu, Ga, Gd, Ge, Mn, Mo, Nb, Nd, Ni, Pb, Pr, Rb, Sm, S, Sr, Ta, Tb, V, Zn, and Zr, matrix matching calibration with 103Rh as internal standard (IS) was performed. The obtained limits of detection were between 0.68 (Tb) and 30 (Zn) μgL−1. For accuracy verification, certified Skim milk powder reference material (BCR 063R) was employed. The developed method was applied to trace elements analysis of commercially available milks. Principal components analysis was used to correlate the content of trace metals with the kind of milk, obtaining a classification according to adults, baby or baby fortified milks. The outcomes highlight a simple and fast approach that could be trustworthy for routine analysis, quality control and traceability of milks.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aarsenic 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3acadmium 3acobalt 3acopper 3adetection limit 3adried skim milk 3aelemental composition 3alead 3amanganese 3amilk 3amolybdenum 3anickel 3aprincipal component analysis 3asolubilization 3astrontium 3atraceability 3avanadium 3azinc 3azirconium 0aMilk analysis 0aSolubilization with N,N-dimethylformamide, High efficiency sample introduction system 0aInductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry 0aPrincipal component analysis1 aSavio, Marianela1 aSmichowski, Patricia1 aMartinez, Luis D.1 aCamiña, José M.1 aGil, Raúl A.0 tTalanta.g2015 Oct. 01, v. 143 p.64-70dElsevier B.V.x0039-91407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2015.04.0883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03024naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002100153245014500174520161800319592002801937650002601965650001801991650001302009650001002022650002002032650001302052650001202065650002202077650001202099650001602111650001202127650001002139650001302149650001302162650002602175653002502201653001602226653001502242653000802257653000802265700002102273700002202294700001802316773011102334856008802445852000902533655001202542IND60741860020221118053148.0210904e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074186002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.forsciint.2021.1108782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhlström, Stina10aCharacteristics of post-mortem beta-hydroxybutyrate-positivet cases – A retrospective study on age, sex and BMI in 1407 forensic autopsies  aPost-mortem biochemistry, including the analysis of beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), is increasingly employed in forensic medicine, especially in conditions such as diabetes and chronic alcoholism. However, not much is known about the associations between age, body mass index (BMI), and sex and BHB concentrations in ketoacidotic conditions.To retrospectively study the association between age, BMI and sex in several conditions, such as diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), alcoholic ketoacidosis (AKA), and elevated post-mortem BHB concentrations.1407 forensic autopsy cases analysed for BHB were grouped by diagnosis: DKA, AKA, HHS [hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic state], acidosis NOS [not otherwise specified], or hypothermia. Age, sex, BMI and the concentrations of blood alcohol, vitreous glucose and blood BHB were recorded.Cases of AKA and DKA were most numerous (184 and 156, respectively). In DKA and in its male subgroup, cases with severe ketosis (BHB>1000 µg/g) were younger and had a lower BMI than those with moderate ketosis (BHB 250–1000 µg/g) and controls (P<0.001). In DKA and in its female subgroup, cases with moderate ketosis cases were older (P = 0.0218 and P = 0.0083) than controls. In AKA and in its male subgroup, cases with severe ketosis had a lower BMI than those with moderate ketosis (P = 0.0391 and P = 0.0469) and controls (P<0.001). Cases with moderate ketosis had a lower BMI than controls (P<0.001).BHB concentration is associated with BMI in DKA and AKA, and with both BMI and age in DKA. Constitutional factors should, therefore, be considered in potential AKA and DKA cases.  aPublisher supplied data 3a3-hydroxybutyric acid 3aalcohol abuse 3aalcohols 3ablood 3abody mass index 3adiabetes 3afemales 3aforensic sciences 3aglucose 3ahypothermia 3aketosis 3amales 3amedicine 3anecropsy 3aretrospective studies 0aBeta-hydroxybutyrate 0aPost-mortem 0aAlcoholism 0aBMI 0aAge1 aThiblin, Ingemar1 aJönsson, Anna K.1 aGreen, Henrik0 tForensic science international.g2021 Aug., v. 325 p.110878-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:3523x0379-07387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.forsciint.2021.1108783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03531naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245018400161520193100345592002802276650002102304650001902325650001602344650001202360650001802372650002002390650002002410650001702430650002302447650001702470650003002487650001502517650001102532650001902543650002102562650002002583650002702603650001402630650001802644650001002662650002002672650001402692650001702706650001102723650001602734650001002750650001702760651001002777773012002787856007302907852000902980655001202989IND60707843520221122082051.0200821e20200810xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070784352DNAL7 a10.3390/f110808702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKayama, Masazumi 10aGrowth and Nutrient Acclimation of Evergreen Oak Seedlings Infected with Boletus reticulatus in Infertile Colluvial Soil in Warm Temperate Monsoon Asia: Evaluation of Early Growth  aSoil erosion after harvesting of forest plantations can create infertile colluvial soil, therefore, seedlings used for site reforestation should be equipped against nutrient-poor edaphic conditions. The oak genus is a suitable candidate for such reforestation efforts. Oak is an ectomycorrhizal (ECM) tree genus known to grow under infertile environments. In this study, the initial stage of tree growth in three species of oak seedlings inoculated with a spore suspension of ECM fungus was monitored to evaluate the acceleration of seedling growth and nutrient uptake. I selected Quercus acuta Thunb., Quercus glauca Thunb., and Quercus salicina Blume, as these are common, evergreen, broad-leaved woody species commonly found in Southwestern Japan. The seedlings were inoculated with Boletus reticulatus and planted in infertile colluvial soils collected from a site that had undergone soil erosion. I also compared the ecophysiological characteristics of the potted seedlings planted in colluvial soil and normal forest soil. After six months of cultivation, Q. glauca with the ECM showed the highest growth rate in the fertile forest soil and had leaves with a higher nutrient content. In contrast, root dry mass increased slightly in Q. acuta and Q. salicina planted in colluvial soil. In all species, the seedling’s ECM colonization rate in colluvial soil was lower than that in forest soil, yet the increase in nutrient uptake in the former was not obvious. The contents of K and Ca in the roots of Q. acuta and Q. salicina increased with B. reticulatus infection. I concluded that the inoculation with a B. reticulatus spore suspension effectively accelerated the growths in all three Quercus species. Q. glauca favored a fertile environment, and Q. acuta and Q. salicina suitably acclimated to both soil types. Thus, these species were selected as potential future candidates for reforestation in such eroded sites.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHexagonia tenuis 3aQuercus glauca 3aacclimation 3acalcium 3aecophysiology 3aectomycorrhizae 3aedaphic factors 3aeroded soils 3aforest plantations 3aforest soils 3afungal diseases of plants 3aharvesting 3aleaves 3amonsoon season 3anutrient content 3anutrient uptake 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3apotassium 3areforestation 3aroots 3aseedling growth 3aseedlings 3asoil erosion 3aspores 3atree growth 3atrees 3awoody plants 3aJapan0 tForests.g2020 Aug. 10, v. 11, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f110808703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03802naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100003300164245008900197300001600286500001500302520161900317592002801936650001701964650001501981650001701996650001002013650002902023650001502052650001502067650001702082650001402099650001402113650001402127650002002141650002602161650001802187650002502205650001602230650001302246650002602259650001202285650001702297650001702314650004002331650002302371650003102394650009302425650009202518650002202610650002602632650002102658650002102679650003002700650003202730651001002762651001002772653001802782700001902800700002202819700002702841700003502868700002202903773009802925856004803023852000903071655001203080IND4473547620221118062209.0120425e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447354762DNAL7 a221832982pmid7 a10.1007/s10482-011-9684-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSánchez Valenzuela, Antonio10aCharacterization of Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium from wild flowers  ap. 701-711.  a2019-12-06  aWild flowers in the South of Spain were screened for Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium. Enterococci were frequently associated with prickypear and fieldpoppy flowers. Forty-six isolates, from 8 different flower species, were identified as E. faecalis (28 isolates) or E. faecium (18 isolates) and clustered in well-defined groups by ERIC-PCR fingerprinting. A high incidence of antibiotic resistance was detected among the E. faecalis isolates, especially to quinupristin/dalfopristin (75%), rifampicin (68%) and ciprofloxacin (57%), and to a lesser extent to levofloxacin (35.7%), erythromycin (28.5%), tetracycline (3.5%), chloramphenicol (3.5%) and streptomycin (3.5%). Similar results were observed for E. faecium isolates, except for a higher incidence of resistance to tetracycline (17%) and lower to erythromycin (11%) or quinupristin/dalfopristin (22%). Vancomycin or teicoplanin resistances were not detected. Most isolates (especially E. faecalis) were proteolytic and carried the gelatinase gene gelE. Genes encoding other potential virulence factors (ace, efaA fs, ccf and cpd) were frequently detected. Cytolysin genes were mainly detected in a few haemolytic E. faecium isolates, three of which also carried the collagen adhesin acm gene. Hyaluronidase gene (hyl Efm ) was detected in two isolates. Many isolates produced bacteriocins and carried genes for enterocins A, B, and L50 mainly. The similarities found between enterococci from wild flowers and those from animal and food sources raise new questions about the puzzling lifestyle of these commensals and opportunistic pathogens.  aPublisher supplied data 3atetracycline 3arifampicin 3astreptomycin 3agenes 3ahyaluronoglucosaminidase 3aenterocins 3avancomycin 3aAngiospermae 3ascreening 3avirulence 3apathogens 3achloramphenicol 3aEnterococcus faecalis 3aciprofloxacin 3aEnterococcus faecium 3aproteolysis 3acollagen 3aantibiotic resistance 3aflowers 3awild flowers 3aerythromycin 2aAnti-Bacterial Agentsxpharmacology 2aDNA Fingerprinting 2aDrug Resistance, Bacterial 2aEnterococcus faecalisxclassificationxdrug effectsxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aEnterococcus faeciumxclassificationxdrug effectsxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aEnzymesxgenetics 2aFlowersxmicrobiology 2aGenes, Bacterial 2aMolecular Typing 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aVirulence Factorsxgenetics 3aSpain 0aSpain 0aMagnoliophyta1 aBenomar, Nabil1 aAbriouel, Hikmate1 aPérez Pulido, Rubén,1 aMartínez Cañamero, Magdalena1 aGálvez, Antonio,0 tAntonie van Leeuwenhoek.g2012 May, v. 101, no. 4 p.701-711dSpringer-Verlagx0003-60727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10482-011-9684-9  aDNAL 7aarticle02045naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245009800158300001600256520073300272592002801005650001301033650002101046650002601067650001301093650001001106650001601116650004401132651002101176700002101197700002301218700001901241700002001260700002401280700002501304700001901329700001701348700002101365773015301386856007501539852000901614655001201623IND60549815620170710000000.0160909e20150424xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054981562DNAL7 a10.1021/np500906k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFigueroa, Luis10a3-Nitroasterric Acid Derivatives from an Antarctic Sponge-Derived Pseudogymnoascus sp.

As a highly urbanized country, visits to the country’s dryland forests constitute an important national pastime across ethnic lines. We evaluated the impact that forest visitation had on the attitudes and perspectives of the visitors. A strong correlation was found between the frequency of visits to forests by individuals and a range of pro-environmental and pro-conservation sentiments. Of particular interest was the response of Israel’s Arab citizens. Not only do Israeli Arabs visit forests more frequently, but they also support environmental policy positions more avidly than do Jewish citizens. The article argues that increasing accessibility to forests and natural sites by expanding public transportation lines should constitute an important component in conservation strategies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabs 3aJews 3aarid lands 3aattitudes and opinions 3aenvironmental policy 3aforests 3anational surveys 3apublic transportation 3aurbanization 3aIsrael1 aBillig, Miriam 0 tForests.g2020 Aug. 10, v. 11, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f110808723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02817naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100003000140245015700170300001800327520136100345592002801706650004401734650002401778650001101802650002001813650001701833650003901850650002001889650002101909650002001930650001601950650003701966650003702003650001502040650002102055700002602076700004102102700003902143773013002182856007402312852000902386655001202395IND60616489720221121051254.0181017e20180927xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061648972DNAL7 a10.1039/c8ay00928g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoreira, Vinicius Azevedo10aEco-friendly synthesis of cuprizone-functionalized luminescent carbon dots and application as a sensor for the determination of copper(ii) in wastewater  ap. 4570-4578.  aA novel and eco-friendly procedure for synthesizing fluorescent carbon dots (CDs) functionalized with cuprizone and their application for the selective determination of Cu²⁺ are presented in this work. Water-soluble and fluorescent CDs were synthesized by a simple, low cost and green approach using sugarcane juice as a renewable natural source for the production of CDs. For the characterization of the CDs, UV-vis absorption spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, the dynamic light scattering technique, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy were used. The synthesized CDs have been functionalized with cuprizone (CPZ) in a simple, fast and single-step procedure. The functionalization eliminated all interference of the other studied metals and the CDs/CPZ was applied to the selective determination of Cu²⁺ in water. Under optimum conditions, a good linear relationship between the fluorescence intensity function and the concentration of Cu²⁺ in the range from 5.12 μM to 100 μmol L⁻¹ with a detection limit (S/N = 3) of 0.76 μmol L⁻¹ was obtained. Finally, this article proposes for the first time a factorial design to optimize the parameters for CD synthesis indicating that the luminescence intensity is a function of temperature and not of the heating time in the hydrothermal process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3acarbon quantum dots 3acopper 3adetection limit 3afluorescence 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3alight intensity 3alight scattering 3asugarcane juice 3atemperature 3atransmission electron microscopy 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 3awastewater 3awater solubility1 aToito Suarez, Willian1 ade Oliveira Krambeck Franco, Mathews1 aGambarra Neto, Francisco Fernandes0 tAnalytical methods.g2018 Sept. 27, v. 10, no. 37 p.4570-4578dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8ay00928g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03033naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001700094024002300111024002700134024003000161024001200191040001800203100002000221245008600241300001600327506017300343520073100516592002801247596009401275596004501369650003101414650002501445650002901470650002601499650001801525650001301543650001601556650004801572650003701620650004401657650001601701650002201717700002201739700001901761700001401780700002001794700002401814700001901838700001901857700002001876700001801896773016801914856011402082856007402196956015502270961000902425852000902434655001202443IND60549815720221214225856.0160909e20150424xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054981572DNAL7 a3272462aris7 a10113/54981572hdl7 a10.1021/np500911k2doi7 a10.1021/np500911k2chorus8 ans17969  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRavu, Ranga

In the present study, association mapping was performed for yield traits based on 172 popular Upland cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) cultivars in China and 331 polymorphic simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. The gene diversity index of 331 markers ranged from 0·0387 to 0·7799 with an average of 0·4002, and the polymorphism information content ranged from 0·0379 to 0·7473 with an average of 0·3375. A total of 93 significantly associated markers for seven yield traits were identified across more than one environment, among which 11 were for seed cotton yield, 12 for lint yield, 11 for boll number per plant, 13 for boll weight, 21 for lint percentage, 14 for lint index and 11 for seed index. The corresponding ranges in phenotypic variation explained by markers across four environments for these seven traits were 1·75–10·49, 1·75–9·34, 2·84–11·80, 2·59–9·89, 2·38–13·97, 2·73–14·82 and 2·50–11·88%, respectively. Some of the yield-associated markers detected were found to be linked to or associated with the same traits identified in previous studies. Furthermore, elite alleles for yield traits were also mined. The present study can provide useful information for further understanding the genetic basis of yield traits, and facilitate high-yield breeding by molecular design in Upland cotton.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGossypium hirsutum 3aagricultural sciences 3aalleles 3acultivars 3agenetic variation 3alinkage disequilibrium 3alint cotton 3alint yield 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aphenotypic variation 3aseed cotton 3aChina1 aDONG, N.1 aFU, Y.

Butenes were easier to convert than butanes, and 1-butene was the easiest to convert among the butene isomers. The ethene and propene yields increased with increased reaction temperature and decreased with increased weight hourly space velocity (WHSV). The formation of propene involved two successive steps: butene dimerization and large hydrocarbon cracking. Aromatics were formed by the aromatization of the intermediate large olefins. A mechanism parameter RCA was proposed to describe the relative function of the cracking reaction to the aromatization reaction. RCA increased with increased reaction temperature and decreased with increased WHSV. The cracking reaction predominates on the aromatization reaction at high reaction temperatures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaromatic compounds 3abutanes 3acatalysts 3acatalytic cracking 3acracking 3adimerization 3aethylene 3afluidized beds 3aisomers 3apropylene 3atemperature 3ayields1 aWang, Zhixi1 aZhang, Rui1 aXu, Chunming1 aLiu, Zhichang1 aWang, Yadong1 aGuo, Qiang0 tFuel processing technology.g2013 Dec., v. 116 p.217-221dElsevier B.V.x0378-38207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuproc.2013.06.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02576naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245014200165520127400307592002801581650001301609650000901622650001601631650000901647650002501656650001701681650001601698650002101714650001601735653001901751653001801770653002201788653002301810700001801833700001501851700001401866700006301880700001601943773010001959856008602059852000902145655001202154IND60741860220221118053155.0210723e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074186022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.firesaf.2021.1033922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Song10aInertant effects and mechanism of Al(OH)3 powder on polyethylene dust explosions based on flame propagation behavior and thermal analysis  aTo assess the inhibitory effect and mechanism of Al(OH)₃ powder on the flame propagation from a polyethylene dust explosion, tests were conducted in a vertical transparent tube. The results show that the addition of Al(OH)₃ powder has a significant effect on the polyethylene dust explosion flame structure and propagation characteristics. With increasing mass ratio of Al(OH)₃ powder, the polyethylene dust explosion flame brightness decreases, the flame propagation velocity decreases, and pulsation of the flame during propagation diminishes. The Al(OH)₃ powder destroys the continuity of the structure of a polyethylene dust explosion flame, and retards the acceleration of flame propagation. The thermal weight loss of the polyethylene gradually decreased with increasing addition of Al(OH)₃ powder. Al(OH)₃ powder can retard the characteristic temperature of severe heat release from polyethylene. The cumulative heat release gradually decreases with the increasing amount of Al(OH)₃ powder. Al(OH)₃ powder can inhibit flame propagation of polyethylene dust explosion through physical effects such as cooling, heat insulation, and suffocation. This work is of significance for the prevention and treatment of polyethylene dust explosion accidents.  aPublisher supplied data 3aasphyxia 3adust 3afire safety 3aheat 3ainsulating materials 3apolyethylene 3atemperature 3athermal analysis 3aweight loss 0aDust explosion 0aVertical tube 0aFlame propagation 0aInerting mechanism1 aLiu, Zhentang1 aQian, Jifa1 aZhao, Hui1 aʻAlī, Muḥammad,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0351-28641 aGu, Zhoujie0 tFire safety journal.g2021 Sept., v. 124 p.103392-dElsevier LtdwJournal:3526x0379-71127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.firesaf.2021.1033923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02839naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245014100163520134000304592002801644650002201672650003001694650001101724650002301735650001201758650001501770650001801785650001201803650001901815650001101834650001401845650002601859650001701885650002001902650001301922651001101935700003301946700002801979700002902007700002202036700003302058700003102091700003002122773012302152856007302275852000902348655001202357IND60647872520221120131806.0190623e20180203xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064787252DNAL7 a10.3390/d100100092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChan-Keb, Carlos A.10aEcophysiological Response of Rhizophora mangle to the Variation in Hydrochemistry during Five Years along the Coast of Campeche, México  aWe evaluated the phenological response and litterfall production of Rhizophora mangle to changes in pore water chemistry over a five-year period (from 2009 to 2014 and 2010 to 2016) along the coast of Campeche, México. Severe drought conditions were recorded in 2009 with a Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) of −1.5 and again in 2015 with a SPI of −1.16). A precipitation deficit of 22.1% was recorded between 2009 and 2016 ranging from 9.5% in Laguna de Terminos in the south to 64.4% in Los Petenes Biosphere Reserve in the north. Precipitation varied significantly per year (p < 0.001), seasonally (p < 0.001), and between years and seasons (p < 0.001). An interaction was observed in the salinity (p < 0.05), redox potential (p < 0.001), and precipitation (p < 0.001) of the Laguna de Terminos, Rio Champoton, and Los Petenes Biosphere Reserve regions. Significant differences were found between the years in the leaf and propagule production (p < 0.001), and between seasons in production of leaves, flowers, and propagules (p < 0.001). The determining factor in the production of flowers during both the rainy and dry seasons was the salinity, and the determining factors for the production of propagules were the redox potential and salinity. The results of this study suggest a low phenotypic plasticity in R. mangle.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRhizophora mangle 3aatmospheric precipitation 3acoasts 3aconservation areas 3adrought 3adry season 3aecophysiology 3aflowers 3ahydrochemistry 3aleaves 3aphenology 3aphenotypic plasticity 3aplant litter 3aredox potential 3asalinity 3aMexico1 aAgraz-Hernández, Claudia M.1 aMuñiz-Salazar, Raquel,1 aPosada-Vanegas, Gregorio1 aOsti-Sáenz, Juan1 aReyes Castellano, Jordán E.1 aConde-Medina, Kenia Paolha1 aVega-Serratos, Beatriz E.0 tDiversity.g2018 Feb. 03, v. 10, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21675x1424-28187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/d100100093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02315naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245023800158300001800396520105400414592002801468650002301496650001301519650002301532650002201555650002301577650002201600650001701622650001501639650001801654650002701672700002401699700001701723773013001740856007401870852000901944655001201953IND60616489820221121051334.0181017e20180927xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061648982DNAL7 a10.1039/c8ay01201f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWalash, M.

The first method was based on measuring the native fluorescence of salmeterol in an aqueous solution at 415 nm after excitation at 245 nm. The second method was established using sodium dodecyl sulphate, SDS, as an organized medium to enhance the fluorescence of trimebutine. The enhanced fluorescence of trimebutine was traced at λₑₘ of 363 nm and λₑₓ of 265 nm. The calibration curves were constructed by plotting intensity of fluorescence versus concentration over the range of 6.0–60.0 and 7.0–70.0 ng mL⁻¹ for salmeterol and trimebutine, respectively. The methods were perfectly implemented for the analysis of salmeterol and trimebutine in their pharmaceutical dosage forms. Furthermore, testing of the uniformity of salmeterol aerosol content was properly achieved. Moreover, validation parameters were applied according to ICH guidelines.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive ingredients 3aaerosols 3aanalytical methods 3aaqueous solutions 3acost effectiveness 3adrug formulations 3afluorescence 3aguidelines 3araw materials 3asodium dodecyl sulfate1 aAbo El Abass, Samah1 aFathy, M.

Trotter), the only cultivated species in this genus. Very little is known about the genetic potential of these species for tef improvement and genomics research. Here, we investigated a germplasm panel consisting of 40 Eragrostis species and 42 tef lines with single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data generated using the genotyping by sequencing (GBS) protocol. Thousands of SNPs were identified genome-wide from the germplasm panel. High-quality SNPs were used to assess sequence similarity and/or divergence, genetic diversity, population structure, and phylogenetic relationships. Mapping individual reads to the tef reference genome revealed that of the 40 wild Eragrostis species included in this study, E. pilosa, E. aethiopica, E. obtusa, E. ferruginea, E. lugens, and E. lehmanniana had 92% of their sequences represented in the tef reference genome. In the maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis, these wild species clearly showed grouping in the clade consisting of the entire tef germplasm. Population structure analysis showed two major clusters consistent with the germplasm class information and the inferred phylogenetic relationships. The wild Eragrostis species were more diverse than the tef cultivars and could therefore potentially be used to enrich the tef gene pool. The SNP dataset and the results documented here are taxonomically the most inclusive to date and could be a useful informational tool for the design of genomics-informed tef breeding and research.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEragrostis lehmanniana 3aEragrostis tef 3acultivars 3adata collection 3agene pool 3agenetic traits 3agenetic variation 3agenome 3agenomics 3agenotyping by sequencing 3agermplasm 3aphylogeny 3aplant breeding 3apopulation structure 3asequence homology 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3astatistical analysis1 aCannarozzi, Gina1 aWeichert, Annett1 aTadele, Zerihun0 tDiversity.g2018 Mar. 21, v. 10, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21675x1424-28187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/d100200173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02063naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002000153245005000173300001800223520123400241592002801475650001301503650000901516650001401525700002201539700002101561773010501582856008901687852000901776655001201785IND60558800820170629000000.0161117e20161117xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055880082DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.6b017262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMolinder, Roger10aCharacteristics of Particles in Pyrolysis Oil  ap. 9456-9462.  aParticles filtered out of pyrolysis oil produced through fast pyrolysis of stem wood, willow, reed canary grass, bark, and forest residue were characterized using scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive spectroscopy with the aim of identifying particle categories and discussing transport mechanisms of particles and inorganics into the oil. Particles filtered out of both the condensed and the aerosol fractions of the oil displayed three types of morphology: (i) char-like structures (1–15 μm), (ii) spheres (100 nm to 1 μm), and (iii) irregularly shaped residue (50–500 nm). The char-like structures were identified as char. The spheres and irregularly shaped residue shared morphology and composition with tar balls and organic particles with inorganic inclusions. These particles could have formed either during the fast pyrolysis stage or through precipitation from the oil during storage. All particles consisted mainly of C and O but also small amounts of inorganics. The particles from the aerosol fraction of the oil had higher inorganics content than the particles from the condensed fraction. The results were discussed, and suggested transport mechanisms of inorganics into particles were presented.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3aoils 3apyrolysis1 aSandström, Linda1 aWiinikka, Henrik0 tEnergy & Fuels.g2016 Nov. 17, v. 30, no. 11 p.9456-9462dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.energyfuels.6b017263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02781naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006200148245013100210300001100341520153700352592002801889596004101917650002001958650001401978650001101992650001202003650001702015650001602032650001502048650001402063650001502077650001502092651001402107700002202121700002002143700002302163773010502186856008302291852000902374655001202383IND60734286020221119054731.0211220e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073428602DNAL7 a10.1186/s40317-021-00237-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeidmann, Sarah L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0729-022910aHome range characteristics and diel patterns in space use of mutton snapper, Lutjanus analis, in St. Thomas, US Virgin Islands  ap. 15.  aBACKGROUND: The movement ecology of mutton snapper Lutjanus analis is poorly understood despite their ecological and economic importance in the Caribbean. Passive acoustic telemetry was used to determine home ranges of six adult L. analis, including diel patterns, in Brewers Bay, St. Thomas, US Virgin Islands. Understanding long-term space use, including site fidelity and habitat usage, is necessary to implement effective and appropriate management actions for a species with extensive space and resource needs. RESULTS: Individual L. analis were tracked over an average period of 316 days (range 125–509 days) and showed high site fidelity to relatively small home ranges (mean ± SD: 0.103 ± 0.028 km², range 0.019–0.190 km²) and core use areas with low overlap among individuals. Most home ranges had a habitat composition dominated by seagrass and to a lesser degree, coral reef and/or pavement. Nighttime activity spaces were distinct from but contained within daytime areas. CONCLUSIONS: Mutton snapper showed strong site fidelity to home ranges in Brewers Bay. Two individuals that were absent from the array for more than a few hours were detected at separate arrays at spawning aggregation sites. This study expands upon knowledge of mutton snapper home range characteristics, highlights the importance of maintaining adjacent high-quality habitat types in any spatial management plan, and encourages the adoption of other types of management strategies, particularly for transient-aggregating species.  aPublisher supplied data  a1355437cNational Science Foundation 3aLutjanus analis 3aacoustics 3aadults 3aanimals 3abiotelemetry 3acoral reefs 3ahome range 3apavements 3aphilopatry 3aseagrasses 3aCaribbean1 aJossart, Jonathan1 aKimble, Melissa1 aNemeth, Richard S.0 tAnimal biotelemetry.g2021 Dec., v. 9, no. 1 p.15-15dBioMed CentralwJournal:21547x2050-33857nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40317-021-00237-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03590naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245014100169300001600310520161500326592002801941650001701969650001201986650001501998650001102013650001702024650001202041650001902053650001902072650001302091650001402104650001102118650001202129650001302141650001902154650001702173650001402190650002002204650001102224650003002235651001102265651002902276653002202305653001902327653002702346653002202373653002002395653002902415653000902444700002102453700002002474700002202494700002402516700002302540700002202563700002402585700001602609700002202625700002302647700002202670773011902692856008402811852000902895655001202904IND60544904820221120101021.0160901e20130415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054490482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.palaeo.2013.02.0352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarel, Sylvain10aPaleohydrological and paleoenvironmental changes recorded in terrestrial sediments of the Paleocene–Eocene boundary (Normandy, France)  ap. 184-199.  aThe Paleocene–Eocene boundary (55.8Ma) is associated with the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM), which is characterized by a negative Carbon Isotope Excursion (CIE), reflecting a major perturbation of the carbon cycle, and by an extreme and rapid global warming. The Cap d'Ailly area (Upper Normandy, France), in which previous studies have revealed the Paleocene–Eocene transition, is a reference locality for organic-rich terrestrial and lagoonal deposits of the “Sparnacian” stage, widespread in Northwestern Europe. In this study, we focus on the organic matter content of the Vasterival section. Organic data (Rock-Eval, palynofacies, biomarker analyses and compound specific isotope analyses) were acquired in order to constrain the paleoenvironmental and paleohydrological changes that occurred at the Paleocene–Eocene boundary. Stable carbon isotope compositions of higher plant leaf wax n-alkanes reveal a CIE of −4.5‰, extending throughout the second half of the studied section. Palynofacies observations reveal: (i) an abrupt shift from a closed, quiescent marsh pond to an open eutrophic swamp subjected to algal blooms, concomitant with the onset of the CIE; and (ii) the evolution from a swamp to a tidal flat due to the marine transgression that occurred during the PETM. Higher plant biomarkers and their hydrogen isotopic composition compared to nitrogen analyses suggest: (i) dry episodes just before the PETM that may help to understand the triggering of this hyperthermal event; and (ii) a moister climate associated with a stronger seasonality during the early PETM.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgal blooms 3aalkanes 3abiomarkers 3acarbon 3acarbon cycle 3aclimate 3aeutrophication 3aglobal warming 3ahydrogen 3ahydrology 3aleaves 3amarshes 3anitrogen 3aorganic matter 3apaleoecology 3asediments 3astable isotopes 3aswamps 3atransgressive segregation 3aFrance 3aNorthern European region 0aPaleoenvironments 0aPaleohydrology 0aContinental ecosystems 0aHydrogen isotopes 0aCarbon isotopes 0aDieppe–Hampshire Basin 0aPETM1 aSchnyder, Johann1 aJacob, Jérémy1 aDupuis, Christian1 aBoussafir, Mohammed1 aLe Milbeau, Claude1 aStorme, Jean-Yves1 aIakovleva, Alina I.1 aYans, Johan1 aBaudin, François1 aFléhoc, Christine1 aQuesnel, Florence0 tPalaeogeography, palaeoclimatology, palaeoecology.g2013 Apr. 15, v. 376 p.184-199dElsevier B.V.x0031-01827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2013.02.0353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02889naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245009400158520165700252592002801909650001401937650002601951650001701977650001901994650002302013650001402036650002202050650002402072650002702096650001502123650003302138651001102171700002602182700003002208700002502238700002302263773012302286856007302409852000902482655001202491IND60647872820221120131657.0190623e20180426xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064787282DNAL7 a10.3390/d100200272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGranado, Renan10aAssessing Genetic Diversity after Mangrove Restoration in Brazil: Why Is It So Important?  aVital for many marine and terrestrial species, and several other environmental services, such as carbon sink areas, the mangrove ecosystem is highly threatened due to the proximity of large urban centers and climate change. The forced fragmentation of this ecosystem affects the genetic diversity distribution among natural populations.

We analyzed the genetic diversity of two mangroves species (Laguncularia racemosa and Avicennia schaueriana) in three areas in Brazil, using inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) markers. Using the local approach, we identified the genetic diversity pool of a restored area compared to nearby areas, including the remnant plants inside the restored area, one well-conserved population at the shore of Guanabara Bay, and one impacted population in Ara&ccedil;&aacute; Bay. The results for L. racemosa showed that the introduced population has lost genetic diversity by drift, but remnant plants with high genetic diversity or incoming propagules could help improve overall genetic diversity. Avicennia schaueriana showed similar genetic diversity, indicating an efficient gene flow. The principal component analysis showing different connections between both species indicate differences in gene flow and dispersal efficiencies, highlighting the needed for further studies. Our results emphasize that genetic diversity knowledge and monitoring associated with restoration actions can help avoid bottlenecks and other pitfalls, especially for the mangrove ecosystem.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAvicennia 3aLaguncularia racemosa 3acarbon sinks 3aclimate change 3aecosystem services 3agene flow 3agenetic variation 3amangrove ecosystems 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amonitoring 3aprincipal component analysis 3aBrazil1 aPinto Neta, Luiza  C.1 aNunes-Freitas, André  F.1 aVoloch, Carolina  M.1 aLira, Catarina  F.0 tDiversity.g2018 Apr. 26, v. 10, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21675x1424-28187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/d100200273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04749naa a2200709 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001700094024002100111024003800132024001100170040001800181100002000199245014500219300001600364506017300380520220700553592002802760650002802788650001902816650001802835650001802853650001802871650001302889650001302902650002102915650001602936650002302952650001402975650001402989650002003003650003103023650001003054650002003064650001503084650004203099650003203141650002003173650001703193650002203210650001803232650002003250650002303270650004303293650005203336650001803388653001203406653002303418653001203441653001403453653001903467700005803486700002203544773015303566856008503719856011203804956008903916961001304005852000904018655001204027IND60006164820221214223806.0190318e20150815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6000616482DNAL7 a3201372aris7 a10113/616482hdl7 a10.1016/j.vetimm.2015.06.0082doi8 ans8627  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTruong, Anh Duc10aHigh-throughput sequencing reveals differing immune responses in the intestinal mucosa of two inbred lines afflicted with necrotic enteritis  ap. 116-124.  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aWe investigated the necrotic enteritis (NE)-induced transcripts of immune-related genes in the intestinal mucosa of two highly inbred White Leghorn chicken lines, line 6.3 and line 7.2, which share the same MHC haplotype and show different levels of NE susceptibility using high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) technology. NE was induced by the previously described co-infection model using Eimeria maxima and Clostridium perfringens. The RNA-Seq generated over 38 million sequence reads for Marek's disease (MD)-resistant line 6.3 and over 40 million reads for the MD-susceptible line 7.2. Alignment of these sequences with the Gallus gallus genome database revealed the expression of over 29,900 gene transcripts induced by NE in these two lines, among which 7,841 genes were significantly upregulated and 2,919 genes were downregulated in line 6.3 chickens and 6,043 genes were significantly upregulated and 2,764 genes were downregulated in NE-induced line 7.2 compared with their uninfected controls. Analysis of 560 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) using the gene ontology database revealed annotations for 246 biological processes, 215 molecular functions, and 81 cellular components. Among the 53 cytokines and 96 cytokine receptors, 15 cytokines and 29 cytokine receptors were highly expressed in line 6.3, whereas the expression of 15 cytokines and 15 cytokine receptors was higher in line 7.2 than in line 6.3 (fold change≥2, p<0.01). In a hierarchical cluster analysis of novel mRNAs, the novel mRNA transcriptome showed higher expression in line 6.3 than in line 7.2, which is consistent with the expression profile of immune-related target genes.In qRT-PCR and RNA-Seq analysis, all the genes examined showed similar responses to NE (correlation coefficient R=0.85–0.89, p<0.01) in both lines 6.3 and 7.2. This study is the first report describing NE-induced DEGs and novel transcriptomes using RNA-seq data from two inbred chicken lines showing different levels of NE susceptibility. These findings provide important insights into our current knowledge of host-pathogen interaction and the nature of host genes that can serve as NE resistance markers for molecular breeding.  aPublisher supplied data 3aClostridium perfringens 3aEimeria maxima 3aGallus gallus 3aMarek disease 3aWhite Leghorn 3abreeding 3achickens 3acluster analysis 3acoccidiosis 3acytokine receptors 3acytokines 3adatabases 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3agenetic markers 3ahaplotypes 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3ahost-pathogen relationships 3aimmune response 3ainbred lines 3aintestinal mucosa 3amessenger RNA 3amixed infection 3anecrotic enteritis 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3atranscriptome 0aRNA-seq 0aNecrotic Enteritis 0aChicken 0aE. maxima 0aC. perfringens1 aHong, Yeong Ho1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4510-78511 aLillehoj, Hyun S.0 tVeterinary immunology and immunopathology.g2015 Aug. 15, v. 166, no. 3-4 p.116-124dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl31971x0165-24277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2015.06.0083Available from publisher's site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/616483Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  aARIS submissionbhttp://submit-u.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/%23320137.pdf  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02778naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132100002400150245010200174300001600276520107100292592002801363650001101391650001401402650002701416650001901443650002401462650001701486650001601503650001501519650001301534650002401547650001201571650001101583650001201594650001201606650001101618650001101629650001101640650001501651650001701666650000901683650002501692650000901717650001401726650001601740650000901756650001301765650001301778650000901791651001101800700003101811700002101842700002501863700002601888700002201914700002501936773008401961856008602045852000902131655001202140IND4462104020221116154353.0141111e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446210402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodcont.2011.08.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMedeiros, Renata J.10aDetermination of inorganic trace elements in edible marine fish from Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil  ap. 535-541.  aFish and seafood may represent risk for human health since they can accumulate contaminants from aquatic environment and magnify them up the food chain.

The aim of this study was to make a spatio-temporal characterization of Términos Lagoon (TL) using a multivariate approach enabling us to better understand the high variability of the system and to recognize underlying gradients. Five samplings were carried out at TL in a period of two years during which physicochemical variables were measured along 25 stations. A principal component analysis was made to analyze changes and interactions between variables in the lagoon, using the scores values at each station to represent the spatial variation for each component. The mapped scores allowed us to detect multivariate gradients generated by the variable interactions in the new components. Each sampling displayed multivariate gradients composed by the interaction of different variables correlated to the principal components. Our results allow us to recognize the processes occurring in TL that are responsible for these gradients. One of the main processes was freshwater discharge, whose influence was irregular. The multivariate gradients proposed evidenced the high variability that characterizes TL and, likely, coastal systems in general. We thus consider that the present methodological approach is adequate for modeling both spatial and time variations in a coastal system.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoastal water 3aestuaries 3afreshwater 3amarine science 3aprincipal component analysis 3aGulf of Mexico 0aCondition of the Scores 0aPrincipal Component Analysis 0aTérminos Lagoon 0aTérminos lagoon 0aEnvironmental gradients 0aEstuaries 0aBrackish water environment 0aPrincipal component analysis (PCA)1 aGutiérrez-Mendieta, Francisco José1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4394-52881 aZavala-Hurtado, José A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3665-51591 aSiqueiros-Beltrones, David A.1 aVarona-Cordero, Francisco1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4601-48061 aHerrera-Moro Chao, Ivanhoe R.0 tRegional studies in marine science.g2022 May, v. 52 p.102284-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23214x2352-48557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rsma.2022.1022843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02701naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245016000163300001600323520139000339592002801729650002601757650002401783650001201807650001301819650002801832650001801860650001001878650001601888650001601904650001401920650001101934650001501945650002101960650002101981650001502002650001402017650001502031651001102046700001802057773009802075856007302173852000902246655001202255IND60135851120221120113551.0150522e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013585112DNAL7 a10.1111/anu.121542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMontanhini Neto, R.10aEvaluation of commercial feeds intended for the Brazilian production of Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus L.): nutritional and environmental implications  ap. 311-320.  aThis study evaluates the composition and nutritional content of feeds for the commercial production of Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus L.) in Brazil. The feeds were assessed from a nutritional standpoint and as potential polluting agents of aquatic environments. The nutritional contents of each feed were calculated by considering the nutritional contributions of its ingredients based on reference tables. These contents were compared to the nutritional recommendations for O. niloticus. Altogether, 130 feeds were analysed, including 32 meant for fingerlings, 30 meant for juveniles, 38 meant for the growth stage and 30 meant for the termination stage. The overall digestibility of the feeds in terms of dry matter utilization was estimated to be 68.5%. Phosphorus was the nutrient with the lowest mean digestibility (51.2%), while protein had the highest mean digestibility (86.6%). Calcium and phosphorus levels exceeded their recommended values by 256.2% and 31.3%, respectively. The ratios of methionine, methionine plus cysteine, threonine and tryptophan to lysine were below their recommended values. The indigestible contents of nitrogen and phosphorus were 6.96 (±2.57) and 7.35 (±1.77) g kg⁻¹, respectively. The information obtained here provides a reference for estimating the productive and polluting potential of feeds used in the production of Nile tilapia.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOreochromis niloticus 3aaquatic environment 3acalcium 3acysteine 3adietary recommendations 3adigestibility 3afeeds 3afingerlings 3aingredients 3ajuveniles 3alysine 3amethionine 3anitrogen content 3anutrient content 3aphosphorus 3athreonine 3atryptophan 3aBrazil1 aOstrensky, A.0 tAquaculture nutrition.g2015 June, v. 21, no. 3 p.311-320dBlackwell Sciencex1353-57737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/anu.121543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04010naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245012200167300001600289520221600305592002802521650002002549650001302569650001502582650002602597650001502623650001902638650002302657650001502680650000902695650001602704650001702720650001002737650001502747650001102762650001102773650002302784650001002807650001802817650002002835651001202855653003502867653004102902653003102943653002602974653002703000653001803027653001203045700001703057700006303074700001703137700005803154773011603212856008303328852000903411655001203420IND60526268220221120192838.0190403e20160131xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052626822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agwat.2015.08.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAin-Lhout, F.10aMonitoring the evolution of soil moisture in root zone system of Argania spinosa using electrical resistivity imaging  ap. 158-166.  aArgania spinosa is an endemic tree of Southwestern Morocco. It grows in arid regions, where annual rainfall ranges between 100 and 300mm and where no other tree species can live. The aim of the study was to investigate, the root system architecture of Argania spinosa and the temporal dynamics of the root-zone moisture after a rain event, using a geophysical technique called Electrical Resistivity Imaging (ERI). This technique discriminates by its different resistivity, woody roots, dry soil and moist soil. We tested the ability of three different ERI profile configurations (Dipole-dipole, Wenner and Wenner–Schlumberger) to measure a correct two-dimensional profile. Six measurements (from April to July) of resistivity sections were performed along a 96 m linear transect that included eight trees. Midday shoot water potential (Ψmd) and leaf relative water content (RWC) were measured during the experimental period, for the eight trees. The results showed that the Wenner configuration was the most appropriate discriminating resistivities of soil, soil moisture and roots. The 2D resistivity pseudo-sections obtained showed three different layers: one thin resistive layer interspersed by very resistant spots corresponding to woody roots, followed by a middle conductive one corresponding to moist soil, and a deeper layer with moderate resistivities. Moisture content changed substantially over time; being lower over summer than in spring. ERI profiles showed that the resistive layer corresponding to the argan roots, was located between 0 and 4 m of depth. The analysis of the 2D resistivity pseudosections revealed significant differences in soil moisture distribution; so that in the zone under argan roots, soil moisture could be measured down to 6 m deep throughout the whole study period, whereas in the zone outside argan roots, moisture was depleted as early as May down the whole profile.As expected, Ψmd, showed minimal values in summer, dropping to −3.3MPa at the end of the experiment. RWC exhibited a similar pattern. Based on the ERI measuring we conclude that argan roots were not exploiting deep water from the aquifer; instead, they are using soil water at few meters deep.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArgania spinosa 3aaquifers 3aarid zones 3aelectrical resistance 3ageophysics 3aimage analysis 3aindigenous species 3amonitoring 3arain 3arhizosphere 3aroot systems 3aroots 3asoil water 3aspring 3asummer 3atemporal variation 3atrees 3awater content 3awater potential 3aMorocco 0a2D resistivity pseudo-sections 0aERI–Electrical resistivity imaging 0aERI profile configurations 0aShoot water potential 0aRelative water content 0aRooting depth 0aDrought1 aBoutaleb, S.1 aDiaz-Barradas, M.C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5486-34241 aJauregui, J.1 aZunzunegui, M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3815-92900 tAgricultural water management.g2016 Jan. 31, v. 164 p.158-166dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8460x0378-37747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2015.08.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02912naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100005300149245014000202520132000342592002801662650001701690650001001707650001701717650000901734650002501743650001001768650003301778650002101811650001401832650001501846650001401861650001601875650002801891651001501919651001401934653001701948653001101965653001901976653001801995700004902013700003702062700004702099700005602146773013502202856008402337852000902421655001202430IND60783895920221120155000.0220902e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078389592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vprsr.2022.1007622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRanaraja, Dissanayaka Mudiyanselage Asha Erandhi10aHepatic trematode Platynosomum sp. (Dicrocoeliidae) from a domestic cat in Colombo, Sri Lanka: Case report and molecular identification  aPlatynosomum is a digenean trematode causing hepatobiliary disease in cats in tropical and subtropical regions. The presence of Platynosomum species in Sri Lanka has not been previously reported or investigated. In the current study, we report a clinical case of a cat suffering from hepatic and biliary complications. Fine-needle aspiration of the biliary extract revealed a large number of parasite eggs, and the morphological and molecular identification of eggs was carried out. Molecular phylogenetics was performed using the nuclear ribosomal Internal Transcribed Spacer 2 (ITS2) and a portion of a mitochondrially encoded gene; Cytochrome C Oxidase subunit 1 (COX1). Through a combination of history, clinical signs, blood reports, ultrasound scanning, light microscopy of eggs from biliary aspirate and molecular studies, the disease was confirmed as parasitism caused by a Platynosomum like species. The Platynosomum species in Sri Lanka is phylogenetically related to Platynosomum illiciens reported from Costa Rica, Central America. This case emphasizes the importance of future studies in Sri Lanka regarding the prevalence and distribution of Platynosomum among cat populations. Further, the inclusion of feline platynosomiasis in the differential diagnoses list for hepatobiliary diseases is required.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPlatynosomum 3ablood 3acase studies 3acats 3acytochrome-c oxidase 3agenes 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3alight microscopy 3aparasites 3aparasitism 3aphylogeny 3aultrasonics 3aveterinary parasitology 3aCosta Rica 3aSri Lanka 0aPlatynosomum 0aFeline 0aEgg morphology 0aPhylogenetics1 aMahakapuge, Thilini Anupama Nanayakkarawasam1 aThilakarathne, Dulari Samanthika1 aDharmasuriya, Juliyabaduge Yushika Chamodi1 aRajapakse, Rajapakse Peramune Veddikkarage Jayanthe0 tVeterinary Parasitology: Regional Studies and Reports.g2022 Sept., v. 34 p.100762-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23280x2405-93907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vprsr.2022.1007623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03861naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245009000171300001600261520213900277592002802416650001302444650002302457650001102480650001502491650001802506650002102524650001502545650002002560650001002580650001402590650002602604650001302630650001802643650002002661650002002681650001602701650001102717650002202728650001502750650002202765650000902787651001102796653001502807653001802822653001902840653001802859653001502877653001502892653002302907653001502930653001902945700002402964700002202988700002503010700001503035773011303050856005103163852000903214655001203223IND50087040120221119230049.0140412e20130401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008704012DNAL7 a10.1080/07060661.2013.7632932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGossen, Bruce D.12aA comparison of clubroot development and management on canola and Brassica vegetables  ap. 175-191.  aClubroot of canola was identified for the first time on the Canadian prairies in 2003, and is spreading rapidly across the region. Although clubroot has been studied extensively on vegetable Brassica crops, it was not clear initially how much of the information would be directly transferable from the intensive production of vegetable crops to the extensive production practices used for canola. This review examines similarities and differences between clubroot development and management on vegetable crops and canola. One important difference was that clubroot generally has a larger economic impact on canola, which is harvested for seed, than on vegetables, especially those where early vegetative growth is the marketable component. Also, clubroot has spread within the production area more quickly than was expected based on vegetable production. This occurs in large part because the resting spores are readily moved within and between fields on the heavy machinery used for canola production, but movement of spores by wind and water is also being assessed. Interestingly, crop rotation to reduce yield losses may be a more viable approach for canola than in vegetable production. Resistance to clubroot is the most consistent and economically viable approach to clubroot management in canola, but several lines of evidence indicate that this resistance may not be durable. Fortunately, the large acreage of canola production in Canada ensures that new sources of resistance will be developed and deployed as existing sources are eroded. Pathogen development and cultural control are very similar on vegetables and canola; bait crops and soil amendments are generally not commercially viable in either system; and biocontrol has a limited potential at this time. Manipulation of seeding date, application of fungicide, and soil fumigation generally have more potential for use in vegetable production than for canola. Identification of approaches that reduce disease pressure in clubroot-infested fields and increase the durability and diversity of genes for clubroot resistance represent important lines of future research.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrassica 3abiological control 3acanola 3acole crops 3acrop rotation 3acultural control 3adurability 3aeconomic impact 3agenes 3apathogens 3apesticide application 3aprairies 3aroot diseases 3asoil amendments 3asoil fumigation 3asowing date 3aspores 3avegetable growing 3avegetables 3avegetative growth 3awind 3aCanada 0abait crops 0abiofungicides 0aBrassica napus 0acrop rotation 0afumigation 0afungicides 0apathogen dispersal 0aresistance 0asoil amendment1 aMcdonald, Mary Ruth1 aHwang, Sheau-Fang1 aStrelkov, Stephen E.1 aPeng, Gary0 tCanadian journal of plant pathology.g2013 Apr. 1, v. 35, no. 2 p.175-191dTaylor & Francisx1715-29927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07060661.2013.763293  aDNAL 7aarticle02448naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002000145245009800165500001900263520143200282592002801714650002201742650002401764650001601788650002301804650002701827650001901854650001201873650000901885700001901894773012101913856007902034852000902113655001202122IND60735086620221120215705.0210423e20210407xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073508662DNAL7 a10.3390/biology100403062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNicolas, Nabil 10a3D Imaging and Quantitative Characterization of Mouse Capillary Coronary Network Architecture  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aCharacterization of the cardiac capillary network structure is of critical importance to understand the normal coronary functional properties and coronary microvascular diseases. The aim of our study was to establish an accessible methodology for 3D imaging and 3D processing to quantitatively characterize the capillary coronary network architecture in mice. Experiments were done on C57BL/6J mice. 3D imaging was performed by light sheet microscopy and confocal microscopy on iDISCO+ optical cleared hearts after labelling of the capillary endothelium by lectin injection. 3D images were processed with the open source software ImageJ. Non-visual image segmentation was based of the frequency distribution of the voxel greyscale values, followed by skeletonization and distance mapping. Capillary networks in left and right ventricles and septum were characterized by the volume network density, the fractal dimension, the number of segments and nodes and their ratio, the total network length, and the average length, diameter, and tortuosity of the segments. Scale-dependent parameter values can be impacted by the resolution limit of the 3D imaging technique. The proposed standardized methodology for 3D image processing is easily accessible for a biologist in terms of investment and difficulty level, and allows the quantification of the 3D capillary architecture and its statistical comparison in different conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputer software 3aconfocal microscopy 3aendothelium 3afractal dimensions 3afrequency distribution 3aimage analysis 3alectins 3amice1 aRoux, Etienne 0 tBiology.g2021 Apr. 07, v. 10, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21557x2079-77377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/biology100403063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01758naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002800154245010300182300001600285520072200301592002801023650002601051650001401077650001501091650002201106650001301128700002301141700002001164700002201184773010601206856008801312990002301400852000901423655001201432IND60096158720221116170648.0141104e20130501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009615872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compbiomed.2013.01.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Canete, J.

Kuwait is vulnerable to SDS trajectories from the middle Euphrates region, specifically, from two “hot spot” areas (Al-Batha and Mamlahat Al-Samawah) of 4550 km² located 250 km from its northern border. This study explores the transboundary SDS jets originating from Southern Iraq using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images obtained from Aqua and Terra satellites over a twelve-year period (2007–2018). Furthermore, an analysis of a 5-day diurnal variation (two days prior, the day of the SDS occurrence, and two days after) explored the hourly patterns of visibility and wind speed, as well as grain size distribution of soil samples to better understand grain size compositions and sediment transport mechanisms. Satellite images confirmed that dust storm jets originated from the “hot spot” in southern Iraq and spread over Kuwait and extended to neighboring Arab Gulf countries as far as Bahrain (900 km) and Qatar (1200 km). In general, the highest wind speed and lowest visibility values were recorded in Northern of Kuwait, with suspended dust sustained for two days following the dust storm. The largest silt and clay fractions (grains ≤63 μm) were identified at the center and west Sabkha region of the “hot spot” area. Very fine sand particles (63–250 μm) were identified within the crescent sand dunes (Barchans) and artificial sand dunes (Al-Fajr). It is recommended that sustainable rehabilitation and land restoration of the “hot spot” area will result in the elimination of the long-range transport of SDS jet streams affecting the downwind Gulf countries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclay fraction 3adiurnal variation 3adunes 3adust 3adust storms 3afloodplains 3agrains 3aland restoration 3amoderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer 3aparticle size distribution 3aremote sensing 3asand 3asatellites 3asediment transport 3asilt 3asoil sampling 3awind speed 3aBahrain 3aIraq 3aKuwait 3aPersian Gulf 3aQatar 0aDust storms 0aMesopotamia 0aSand dunes 0aIraq 0aKuwait1 aAl-Dousari, Ali1 aAl-Dashti, Hassan1 aPetrov, Peter1 aAl-Saleh, Abeer1 aAl-Khafaji, Sarhan1 aBehbehani, Weam1 aLi, Jing1 aKoutrakis, Petros0 tScience of the total environment.g2020 Mar. 25, v. 710 p.136291-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.1362913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02722naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245005700169300001700226520136400243592002801607650001301635650001501648650002301663650001101686650001701697650000901714650001501723650001101738650001301749650002901762650003401791650002101825650001601846653003101862653000801893653002101901653002101922653001301943700002001956700002401976700002102000700002702021773009802048856008502146852000902231655001202240IND60597540220221121084433.0200712e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059754022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2018.05.0452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPoole, Mark R.10aEvaluation of landscape fabric as a solar air heater  ap. 998-1003.  aSolar heating has great potential to displace fossil fuels in agricultural and industrial space heating. The conventional metal transpired solar collectors (mTSC) is highly-efficient but its high cost has impeded its adoption. While the plastic TSC (pTSC) would be less-expensive than the mTSC, it requires perforation. Since a high absorptance, non-woven landscape fabric is widely available and inexpensive, it could be cost-effective solar collector. The landscape fabric collector (fTSC) was compared with mTSC (anodized aluminum) and pTSC for temperature rise (ΔT) and efficiency (η) at two suction velocities (Vₛ). The mTSC and pTSC had porosity of 1.2% while the fTSC had a porosity of 80%. At 0.047 m/s, the fTSC produced higher average ΔT (by at least 2 °C) and average η (by at least 10%) than the mTSC and pTSC that were similar in performance. At the higher Vₛ of 0.060 m/s, the fTSC slightly outperformed the mTSC while the pTSC had the lowest ΔT and η. Superior performance of the fTSC was likely due to lower energy losses than the other two collectors as was indicated by its scanning electron microscope images. Modeling the fTSC as a simplified packed bed may be appropriate and challenges have been identified. Practical scale-up suggestions are provided. The fTSC is the least expensive solar air heater for space heating.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3acollectors 3acost effectiveness 3aenergy 3afossil fuels 3aheat 3alandscapes 3amodels 3aporosity 3arenewable energy sources 3ascanning electron microscopes 3asolar collectors 3atemperature 0aTranspired solar collector 0aUTC 0aLandscape fabric 0aTemperature rise 0aModeling1 aShah, Sanjay B.1 aBoyette, Michael D.1 aGrimes, Jesse L.1 aStikeleather, Larry F.0 tRenewable energy.g2018 Nov., v. 127 p.998-1003dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2018.05.0453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02492naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002900145245016200174500001900336520133200355592002801687650002001715650001801735650001801753650002201771700003001793700003801823700003201861700002501893700003901918773012101957856007902078852000902157655001202166IND60735086820221120164152.0210423e20210408xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073508682DNAL7 a10.3390/biology100403082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSánchez-Labrador, Luis 10aClinical Behavior and Complications of Mandibular Full-Arch Fixed Dental Prostheses Supported by Three Dental Implants. A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis systematic review and meta-analysis set out to assess the clinical behavior of mandibular implant-supported fixed complete dental prostheses (ISFCDP) on three dental implants by analyzing implant and prosthetic survival rates, marginal bone loss, biological/technical complications, and patient-reported outcomes. The review was conducted according to PRISMA guidelines. Electronic searches were conducted in the Medline (PubMed), Web of Science, and Cochrane databases, complimented by a manual search in specialist journals for relevant articles published up to February 2021. The Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale tool was used to assess the quality of evidence in the studies reviewed. The study included 13 articles with 728 patients treated with 2184 implants. A mean implant survival rate of 95.9% (95% CI: 94.6–97.3%) and a prosthetic survival rate of 97.0% (95% CI: 95.7–98.3%) were obtained over 1–6-year follow-up periods. Mandibular implant-supported fixed complete dental prostheses on three dental implants would appear to be a viable option for restoring the edentulous mandible in comparison with mandibular ISFCDP on more than three implants. Further comparative studies are needed, with adequate protocols, as well as sufficient sample sizes and follow-up periods to confirm these findings.  aPublisher supplied data 3abone resorption 3ameta-analysis 3asurvival rate 3asystematic review1 aMolinero-Mourelle, Pedro 1 aCortés-Bretón Brinkmann, Jorge 1 aPrados-Frutos, Juan  Carlos1 aGómez-Polo, Miguel 1 aMartínez-González, José  María0 tBiology.g2021 Apr. 08, v. 10, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21557x2079-77377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/biology100403083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02728naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245007700172300001600249520143700265592002801702650002001730650002501750650001101775650001001786650001801796650001501814650001401829650001401843650001401857650001401871650001001885651001201895653001101907653003901918653003901957653001501996653001602011653001402027653001002041700001902051700001502070773011302085856005102198852000902249655001202258IND50087040720221119230146.0140412e20130401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008704072DNAL7 a10.1080/07060661.2013.7751842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHoltz, Michael D.10aVirulence phenotypes of Puccinia striiformis in Alberta from 2009–2011  ap. 241-250.  aOne hundred and four isolates of Puccinia striiformis were obtained primarily from central Alberta during 2009–2011 from wheat, barley, foxtail barley and triticale. Isolates were identified as P. striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst) or P. striiformis f. sp. hordei (Psh) based on virulence on differential seedlings. Twenty-five wheat differentials separated 67 Pst isolates into 12 pathotypes, with a single pathotype representing 48% of Pst isolates. Wheat differentials with resistance genes Yr5 and Yr15 were resistant to all 12 pathotypes, while wheat lines with genes Yr1, Yr10, Yr24, Yr28, YrTyee and YrSP were resistant to 80–98% of the isolates. The remainder of the wheat differentials were susceptible to all Pst isolates. Within the 37 Psh isolates, 12 pathotypes were detected based on 12 barley differentials, half of which were previously unreported in Alberta. The two most common Psh pathotypes combined accounted for 46% of the isolates. One half of the Psh isolates may be the result of hybridization between the two formae speciales since they exhibited virulence on a large number of wheat and triticale lines in addition to barley lines. Psh isolates with these virulence factors were more frequently recovered from six-row than two-row barley. For both formae speciales, there was no apparent association between pathotype and location, with pathotypes being widespread and recovered from multiple locations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHordeum jubatum 3aPuccinia striiformis 3abarley 3agenes 3ahybridization 3apathotypes 3aphenotype 3aseedlings 3atriticale 3avirulence 3awheat 3aAlberta 0abarley 0aPuccinia striiformis f. sp. hordei 0aPuccina striiformis f. sp. tritici 0aresistance 0astripe rust 0avirulence 0awheat1 aKumar, Krishan1 aXi, Kequan0 tCanadian journal of plant pathology.g2013 Apr. 1, v. 35, no. 2 p.241-250dTaylor & Francisx1715-29927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07060661.2013.775184  aDNAL 7aarticle02035naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001900154245009500173300001600268520107200284592002801356650003401384650001601418650001101434700002001445700002101465700002101486773010601507856008801613990002301701852000901724655001201733IND60096158920221116170632.0141104e20130501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009615892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compbiomed.2012.12.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChung, Yu-Feng10aHow to standardize the pulse-taking method of traditional Chinese medicine pulse diagnosis  ap. 342-349.  aThe aim of this report is to propose standard pulse taking procedure of Traditional Chinese Medicine Pulse Diagnosis. In order to acquire full information from taking a wrist pulse, this proposal adopts a tactile sensor with 12 sensing points at one sensing position, such as Cun, Guan, or Chi. Simultaneously Palpation (SP) and Pressing with One Finger (PWOF) are adopted to explore their differences of the detected pulse signals. According to vertical dynamic characteristics, the results of a Pearson product moment reveal that the correlation coefficients of PWOF and SP are highly correlated from Fu to Chen. In addition, according to unique characteristics of body state, the results of a paired samples t test reveal that the SP and PWOF are indifferent at a specific pulse taking depth. Hence, if using the pulse-taking instrument with tactile sensors, it is concluded that pulse signals taken by familiar SP and PWOF methods are shown in statistical indifferences among seven parameters (Vₚₚₘₑₐₙ,Vₚₚₘₐₓ, HR, LENGTH, WIDTH, AS, and DS).  aPublisher supplied data 3aOriental traditional medicine 3acorrelation 3at-test1 aHu, Chung-Shing1 aYeh, Cheng-Chang1 aLuo, Ching-Hsing0 tComputers in Biology and Medicine.g2013 May 1, v. 43, no. 4 p.342-349dElsevier Ltdx0010-48257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compbiomed.2012.12.0103Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02423naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001600149245012000165300001800285500001900303520059800322592002800920650001700948650002500965650001700990650001701007650001401024650001301038650001501051650002101066650001901087650004401106650001301150700001801163700001501181700002601196700001901222700002001241700001701261700002001278700002001298700001701318700001901335700001601354700005601370700005801426700005801484700005701542700005701599773012101656856008301777852000901860655001201869IND60702371220221120121107.0200717e20200706xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070237122DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.0c012492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoon, Kyuho10aStructures and Biosynthetic Pathway of Pulvomycins B–D: 22-Membered Macrolides from an Estuarine Streptomyces sp.  ap. 5358-5362.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPulvomycins B–D (1–3) were discovered from an estuarine Streptomyces strain along with the known pulvomycin (4).

Morphologically superior durum accessions (118 entries) were screened against two isolates of the pathogen from Lorestan and Khuzestan provinces of Iran previously typed as TTKSK (Ug99) at the seedling stage. The putatively resistant entries were tested in replicated experiments along with germplasm known to possess resistance genes, such as ‘Amigo’, ‘Fleming’, ‘Eagle’, ‘Agatha’, ‘Sage’, and ‘RL5711’. We identified putatively novel sources of resistance to Ug99, characterized by infection types 0, 0;, ;1, ;2, ;1+, and 22+. We also observed a previously unreported highly susceptible seedling response in germplasm containing the gene Sr13 to Ug99. The resistant durum accessions include ‘Wc-47208’ from Bulgaria (IT = 0;), ‘Wc-47191’ from Argentina (IT = 0;), ‘Tn-12716’ from Iran (IT = ;1), and ‘P.S.No18’ and ‘P.S.No19’ from Italy (IT = ;2 or ;1+).

Previous study in our laboratory had proved the significant therapeutic effects of K. coccinea extract on adjuvant arthritis rats. To explore the responsible components and possible mechanisms, an AUF-HPLC-Q-TOF/ MS method was employed for screening and characterizing COX-2 ligands from K. coccinea stems for the first time. Meanwhile, the molecular docking was performed to simulate the binding modes for ligands and COX-2, the cell-free enzyme activity assay was applied to verify the direct COX-2 inhibition of potential inhibitors, and the cell-based study on COX-2 expression was to evaluate the anti-inflammatory effect of (+)-Anwulignan. As a result, the potential COX-2 inhibitor (+)-Anwulignan significantly suppressing COX-2 expressions in LPS signaling pathways might be a good candidate for anti-inflammation and analgesia. In conclusion, AUF mass spectrometry combining the molecular docking and bioassays in vitro was an efficient approach for discovering enzyme inhibitors from traditional herbs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aKadsura coccinea 3aadjuvants 3aanalgesia 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3aarthritis 3aenzyme activity 3ainflammation 3aligands 3amass spectrometry 3amedicinal plants 3apain 3aprostaglandin synthase 3aultrafiltration 3aChina 0aKadsura coccinea 0aCOX-2 inhibitor 0aAffinity ultrafiltration-LC/MS 0aMolecular docking 0aAnti-inflammation 0aBioassay in vitro1 aWei, Zi-Jiao1 aQiao, Wei-Li1 aSun, Xiao-Min1 aJin, Zhi-Ling1 aGong, Wen1 aJia, Bei-Xi0 tFitoterapia.g2021 June, v. 151 p.104872-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34526x0367-326X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fitote.2021.1048723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02430naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245007300168300001600241520114600257592002801403650001901431650001301450650001401463650001401477650001101491650001301502650002401515650001501539650002001554650001401574650000901588650001701597650001301614650001001627651001901637653002401656653001901680653001601699700001701715700001601732700001701748773013501765856005101900852000901951655001201960IND50076241120221117210109.0140410e20120101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007624112DNAL7 a10.1080/00103624.2011.6386002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHavlin, J.

Field studies were initiated to survey soil and plant nutrient status over a wide range in geography and management conditions in the dominant V. vinifera regions in North Carolina. While the survey data are still being analyzed, significant information was initially obtained to identify aluminum toxicity and phosphorus and potassium deficiency as potential limiting factors to vine health and productivity. Field studies were initiated to quantify soil test and plant nutrient responses to lime, phosphorus, and potassium rates. Responses to phosphorus and potassium application were observed at most sites predicted by soil tests. However, lime responses were not observed in either petiole or blade samples collected at full bloom or veraison. These studies will be continued until sufficient response data are collected to establish soil test and plant nutrient diagnostic criteria for efficient nutrient management of V. vinifera in North Carolina.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVitis vinifera 3aaluminum 3aflowering 3ageography 3agrapes 3aindustry 3anutrient management 3aphosphorus 3aplant nutrition 3apotassium 3asoil 3asoil surveys 3atoxicity 3avines 3aNorth Carolina 0aNutrient management 0asoil fertility 0awine grapes1 aHardy, D.

The biological activities of these polysaccharides are related to their compositional and structural parameters, whereby their degree of sulfation, as well as molecular weight (MW) distribution and chain conformation play important roles. Modern NMR and mass spectrometry techniques allow elucidating details of the glycan structure, but not the structure of the whole molecules in their native state. Accordingly, the knowledge about the latter of the fucoidans is currently still limited. Contrary to traditional MW determination by SEC with column calibration, SEC with triple detection provides not only the absolute Mw, but can also give information on additional molecule characteristics. In the present study, we used this method to compare six fucoidans extracted from Fucus vesiculosus (FV), F. serratus (FS), F. evanescens (FE), Dictyosiphon foeniculaceus (DF), Laminaria digitata (LD), and Saccharina latissima (SL) concerning their molar mass (Mw, Mₙ, Mₚ, dispersity) and size (rms radius, Rₕ) characteristics and distribution as well as their chain conformation in solution. The tested fucoidans displayed considerable structural diversity including large differences in their MW profiles and showed to be heterogeneously composed. Fuc-FV and Fuc-SL showed the broadest MW distributions, those from Fuc-FE and Fuc-DF the narrowest ones. Most of the fucoidan fractions (except for Fuc-DF) turned out to exist as expanded flexible chains in PBS solution. The conformation data suggest branched structures with partly long side chains. The knowledge obtained by this study is useful for further fractionation and structural characterization as well as the interpretation of the bioactivity differences between the various fucoidans.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDictyosiphon 3aFucus evanescens 3aFucus serratus 3aFucus vesiculosus 3aLaminaria digitata 3aSaccharina latissima 3abioactive properties 3acalibration 3afractionation 3afucoidan 3agel chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3amolecular weight 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3arhodium 0aSEC-MALS 0aMultiple detection 0aMass distribution 0aConformation analysis 0aFucoidans 0aBiopolymers 0aBrown seaweed1 aBittkau, Kaya Saskia1 aAlban, Susanne1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1993-37510 tJournal of chromatography.g2020 Feb. 08, v. 1612 p.460658-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl50504x0021-96737nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2019.4606583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02951naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003200150245011400182300001600296520161200312592002801924650001201952650000901964650001501973650002101988650001402009650002302023650002102046650001802067650001402085650000902099650001102108650001902119650001102138653002502149653001402174653001102188653002302199700002502222700002302247700002802270773013502298856005102433852000902484655001202493IND50076241220221117210010.0140410e20120101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007624122DNAL7 a10.1080/00103624.2011.6386022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAvalos, José Manuel Mirás10aCrop Residue Effects on Calcium, Magnesium, Potassium, and Sodium Runoff Losses from a Soil Prone to Crusting  ap. 315-323.  aIn Galicia (northwestern Spain), cultivated soils developed on schists from the Ordenes series are susceptible to surface degradation, mostly when soil organic content decreases. Therefore, management systems that protect the soil and increase its organic-matter content should also improve its quality. However, tillage practices may cause crusting. Degraded soil surface conditions favor surface runoff, thus enhancing nutrient losses. This study examined the effect of applying crop residues to the soil surface on the basic cation nutrient [calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), potassium (K), and sodium (Na)] losses by runoff from a tilled soil with relatively low organic-matter content. Runoff and sediment yield were measured on 1-m² plots using a rainfall simulator with constant 65 mm h⁻¹ intensity. Four successive rainfall applications were performed, the first three at 25 mm each and the last at 65 mm. Added corn straw varied between 0 and 4 t ha⁻¹ in the five treatments studied. Total and dissolved concentrations of the elements studied showed a tendency to decrease due to the effect of corn straw on soil losses. After 140 mm cumulative rainfall, total nutrient losses were as follows: Ca from 12.32 to 28.94 mg L⁻¹, Mg from 20.81 to 148.90 mg L⁻¹, K from 14.20 to 35.17 mg L⁻¹, and Na from 14.99 to 23.41 mg L⁻¹. The relative contribution of the dissolved fraction to the total nutrient content loss was highly variable, being up to 90% for Na. The results confirm that corn residues applied to a degraded soil, with low structural stability, prevent cation nutrient losses.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcium 3acorn 3acorn straw 3alosses from soil 3amagnesium 3amanagement systems 3anutrient content 3aorganic soils 3apotassium 3arain 3arunoff 3asediment yield 3asodium 0aMain nutrient losses 0amicroplot 0arunoff 0asimulated rainfall1 aFouz, Patricia Sande1 aBertol, Ildegardis1 aPaz González, Antonio,0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g2012 Jan. 1, v. 43, no. 1-2 p.315-323dTaylor & Francis Groupx1532-24167nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00103624.2011.638602  aDNAL 7aarticle01995naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005700148245006100205520095300266592002801219650001801247650001901265651001101284651001801295651002001313653001301333653001601346653002201362653002201384700005501406773011601461856008301577852000901660655001201669IND60731531220221120111722.0210904e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073153122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ufug.2021.1270802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Hanyan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3301-219010aPocket parks in English and Chinese literature: A review  aPocket parks have the characteristics of being small in size, low in expenditure, easy to access and flexible in shapes and location. Several studies have explored the environmental and social benefits as well as the design principles of pocket parks. However, a meta-analysis of research on pocket park is lacking. There is also no previous comparison of Chinese and English language research papers on pocket parks. This paper aims to systematically review 32 key English publications and 33 key Chinese publications from 4 databases (i.e. Google Scholar, Web of Science, CNKI, Wanfang Data). The results show that the definition of pocket park is only different in size when comparing English and Chinese papers. Moreover, the review highlighted the needs of exploring pocket parks in the areas of Latin America, Africa and Southeast Asia. The summary of research topics and trends provides a useful knowledge for future studies on pocket parks.  aPublisher supplied data 3ameta-analysis 3aurban forestry 3aAfrica 3aLatin America 3aSouth East Asia 0aMinipark 0aPocket park 0aSmall green space 0aSystematic review1 aHan, Mingxi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1230-07160 tUrban forestry & urban greening.g2021 June, v. 61 p.127080-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl893556x1618-86677nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ufug.2021.1270803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03460naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006800150245014500218520178200363592002802145650001502173650002802188650002102216650005302237650002402290650001402314650001802328650002302346650001802369650002202387650001602409650001102425650001502436650002202451650002002473650001002493653001202503653001702515653001802532653003302550653003702583653003902620700001902659700001902678700001602697700002102713773011402734856008502848852000902933655001202942IND60674801520221118033528.0200210e20200208xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067480152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2019.4606612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRandazzo, Giuseppe Marco1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1585-001910aSteroid identification via deep learning retention time predictions and two-dimensional gas chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry  aUntargeted steroid identification represents a great analytical challenge even when using sophisticated technology such as two-dimensional gas chromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry (GC × GCHRMS) due to the chemical similarity of the analytes. Moreover, when analytical standards, mass spectral and retention index databases are not available, compound annotation is cumbersome. Hence, there is a need for the development of retention time prediction models in order to explore new annotation approaches. In this work, we evaluated the use of several in silico methods for retention time prediction in multidimensional gas chromatography. We use three classical machine learning (CML) algorithms (Partial Least Squares (PLS), Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Random Forest Regression (RFR)) and two deep learning approaches (dense neural network (DNN) and three-dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN)). Whereas molecular descriptors were utilized for the CLM and DNN algorithms, three-dimensional molecular representation based on the electrostatic potential (ESP) was studied as input data as is for the CNN. All the developed models showed similar performances with Q² values over 0.9. However, among all CNN showed the best performance, resulting in average retention time prediction errors of 2% and 6% for the first and second separation dimension, respectively. Additionally, only the three-dimensional ESP representation coupled with CNN was able to extract the stereochemical information crucial for the separation of diastereomers. The combination of retention time prediction and high-resolution mass spectral data applied to clinical samples enabled the untargeted annotation of 12 steroid metabolites in the urine of new-borns.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aartificial intelligence 3achemical species 3acomprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography 3acomputer simulation 3adatabases 3adiastereomers 3agas chromatography 3aleast squares 3amass spectrometry 3ametabolites 3amodels 3aprediction 3aspectral analysis 3astereochemistry 3aurine 0a3D-QSRR 0aSteroidomics 0aDeep learning 0aConvolutional neural network 0aTime-of-flight mass spectrometry 0aTwo-dimensional gas chromatography1 aBileck, Andrea1 aDanani, Andrea1 aVogt, Bruno1 aGroessl, Michael0 tJournal of chromatography.g2020 Feb. 08, v. 1612 p.460661-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl50504x0021-96737nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2019.4606613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03399naa a2200853 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006300150245009700213300001400310520132800324592002801652650001301680650001701693650000901710650001201719650001001731650001401741650001901755650001701774650001201791650001801803650001101821650002501832650001401857650001501871653000801886653000801894653001101902653000801913653000701921653001401928653001501942653000801957653000801965653000701973653000901980653001401989653000802003653000802011653000902019653001502028653000702043653000902050653000902059653001002068653000802078653000802086653001002094653000802104653001002112653000802122653000902130653000902139653000802148653000802156653000702164653000902171653000902180653002002189653003402209653002802243653001002271700001802281700002702299700002402326773008902350856008502439852000902524655001202533IND60565882720221119072358.0180905e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056588272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.plgene.2017.03.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTripathy, Swapan K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3443-496110aDevelopment of opaque-2 introgression line in maize using marker assisted backcross breeding  ap. 26-30.  aTwo elite normal maize inbreds that produced heterotic experimental hybrid (OML 17-3×OML 42-9) with 45% yield advantage over the standard check Vivek QPM 9, were used for conversion to QPM status using opaque-2 donors (CML 176 and CML 186) using marker assisted back cross breeding. Each of the normal maize parental inbreds was used as female parent in separate conversion programme using cross combination OML 17-3×CML 176 and OML 42-9×CML 186. Foreground selection (using opaque-2 specific marker phi 057) combined with phenotypic selection for recipient parent at early back cross generations (BC1 to BC3) was carried out for rapid recovery of recurrent parent genotype. The BC3F1 plants showing heterozygous status (O2o2) were selfed and advanced to BC3F2 to enable for identification of homozygous recessive opaque-2 segregants at seedling stage. The most promising BC3F3 introgression lines from either cross combinations were finally selected based on higher tryptophan and lysine content. The newly developed introgression lines (OQL 176-17-3 and OQL 186-42-9) were at par with the QPM donors (CML 176 and CML 186) and nearly double the lysine and tryptophan content as compared to respective normal inbreds (OML 17-3 and OML 42-9). These may serve as valuable breeding materials for development of QPM hybrids.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZea mays 3abackcrossing 3acorn 3afemales 3agenes 3aheterosis 3aheterozygosity 3ahomozygosity 3ahybrids 3aintrogression 3alysine 3aphenotypic selection 3aseedlings 3atryptophan 0aOML 0aQPM 0aCIMMYT 0aCML 0aF1 0aF1 and F2 0aBC1 to BC3 0aOQL 0aMAS 0akD 0aRNAi 0aO2 and o2 0aQTL 0aDNA 0aCTAB 0aTris–HCl 0apH 0aEDTA 0aNaCl 0aβ-ME 0aPVP 0aHCl 0aMgCl2 0arpm 0adNTPs 0aPCR 0aRAPD 0aISSR 0aSSR 0aSNP 0abp 0aRFLP 0acDNA 0aχ2 and P-value 0aMarker-assisted back crossing 0aQPM introgression lines 0aMaize1 aLenka, Devraj1 aIthape, Dinesh Manohar1 aMaharana, Manasmita0 tPlant gene.g2017 June, v. 10 p.26-30dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23305x2352-40737nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plgene.2017.03.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02901naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024005500111024002100166040001800187072000900205072000900214100001600223245011000239300001600349500002400365520105100389650001801440650001201458650001301470650001701483650001001500650002301510650001001533650001101543650002301554650001701577650002601594650002101620650002001641650001001661650001201671650004201683650001101725650001101736650001401747653001801761700001601779700001601795700001801811773015601829852000901985856010901994856011202103930003302215945002502248946001302273961001302286655001202299IND4372663820221122024801.0050725e200506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437266382DNAL7 a160331292pmid7 a10.2987/8756-971X(2005)21[229:LEOMTB]2.0.CO;22doi7 a10113/373842hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL821 0aX3801 aSilva, I.M.10aLaboratory evaluation of mosquito traps baited with a synthetic human odor blend to capture Aedes aegypti  ap. 229-233.  aIncludes references  aA synthetic blend of chemicals comprising volatiles released by the human body has been shown to be an effective attractant for female Aedes aegypti in olfactometer bioassays with laboratory-reared mosquitoes. We report the laboratory evaluation of Ae. aegypti response to a synthetic blend tested with 4 types of mosquito traps (CDC model 512, CDC model 1012, CFG, and Fay-Prince traps). Aedes aegypti females were attracted significantly by the blend. The higher release rate of attractant (320.2 +/- 10.71 mg/h) more efficiently attracted mosquitoes than the lower release rate (42.0 +/- 2.3 mg/h). Although both the Fay-Prince and CFG traps caught higher number of mosquitoes than the other traps, only the CFG trap caught a statistically significant greater number of mosquitoes. The results suggest that the synthetic blend is effective in attracting Ae. aegypti females under controlled laboratory conditions (i.e., a closed system). Further studies are needed to evaluate the efficacy of this blend in baited traps under field conditions. 3aAedes aegypti 3afemales 3atrapping 3ainsect traps 3abaits 3avolatile compounds 3aodors 3ahumans 3ainsect attractants 3aolfactometry 3aequipment performance 3amosquito control 3apest monitoring 2aAedes 2aAnimals 2aEntomologyxinstrumentationxmethods. 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aOdorants. 0arelease rates1 aEiras, A.E.1 aKline, D.L.1 aBernier, U.R.0 tJournal of the American Mosquito Control Association.g2005 June, v.  21, no.  2 p.229-233dAmerican Mosquito Control Association, Incx8756-971X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2987/8756-971X(2005)21%5B229:LEOMTB%5D2.0.CO;23Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/373843Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20100112b20100205c00000000  aINDdNZMe2005/08/04  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03091naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245009400172300001600266520164100282592002801923650001301951650001201964650001601976650004301992650003102035650001002066650002102076650001302097650001402110650001202124653002302136653001702159653002102176653001502197653002102212653001702233653001302250700005802263700002202321700002402343773017202367856008502539852000902624655001202633IND60561454820221122064635.0180904e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056145482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jbiosc.2017.01.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOkudaira, Tatsuya10aFabrication of a fiber-type hepatic tissue by bottom-up method using multilayer spheroids  ap. 739-747.  aLiver regenerative medicine, a therapy using cultured hepatocytes or hepatic tissues, has the potential to replace liver transplantation. However, this therapeutic strategy has challenges to overcome, including in construction of the hepatic tissues. As an approach to fabricating functional 3D hepatic tissues, we focused on hepatocyte spheroids, which have high cell density and maintain high liver-specific functions. We employed a bottom-up method using spheroids, arranging hepatocytes and endothelial cells regularly at the time of tissue construction. This enabled a vascular network to be formed within the three-dimensional hepatic tissue. We included NIH/3T3 cells, known to promote vasculature formation by endothelial cells. We fabricated hepatocyte spheroids covered with human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and NIH/3T3 cells (EC-3T3-covered hepatocyte spheroids) and constructed the hepatic tissues by stacking these cell types in hollow fibers. We then performed histological and functional analyses of the resulting hepatic tissues. The hepatic tissues constructed by stacking EC-3T3-covered hepatocyte spheroids showed high liver-specific functions; that is, ammonia removal and albumin secretion. The HUVECs formed endothelial networks. In addition, hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) expression was suppressed in the hepatic tissue throughout the culture period and the hepatic tissue was sufficiently strong for use in certain analyses and applications. In summary, we fabricated a functional 3D hepatic tissue by the bottom-up method using hepatocyte spheroids covered with HUVECs and NIH/3T3 cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalbumins 3aammonia 3ahepatocytes 3ahuman umbilical vein endothelial cells 3ahypoxia-inducible factor 1 3aliver 3aliver transplant 3amedicine 3asecretion 3atissues 0aTissue engineering 0aHollow fiber 0aBottom-up method 0aHepatocyte 0aEndothelial cell 0aNIH/3T3 cell 0aSpheroid1 aYabuta, Ryohei1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6785-37781 aMizumoto, Hiroshi1 aKajiwara, Toshihisa0 tJournal of bioscience and bioengineering.g2017 June, v. 123, no. 6 p.739-747dElsevier B.V.aThe Society for Biotechnology, JapanwJournal:jnl3929975x1389-17237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiosc.2017.01.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02844naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005700094040001800151100002300169245011700192300001600309500001500325520138300340592002801723650002101751650001601772650002001788650001101808650003501819650002301854650002201877650001801899650001401917650001401931650002201945650001001967650001601977650001401993651001102007653001602018653001902034653001002053653001202063653001202075653001202087700002402099773010102123856011702224852000902341655001202350IND50065047620221123005838.0151127e200204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006504762DNAL7 a10.1658/1100-9233(2002)013[0179:SBDOFG]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlvarez-Aquino, C.10aSeedling bank dynamics of Fagus grandifolia var. mexicana before and after a mast year in a Mexican cloud forest  ap. 179-184.  a2019-12-05  aFagus grandifolia var. mexicana seedling dynamics were studied in a relict forest inside the crater of a volcano where it is the only canopy tree species. The objectives of the study were (1) to determine changes in seedling density before and after a mast year, as well as to monitor seedling recruitment, mortality and growth rate in relation to the micro-environment, and (2) to discuss the impact of masting on seedling dynamics of the population. Before masting, seedling density was 8.8 seedlings m––², afterwards seedling density peaked at 51.5 seedlings m––², then decreased by 50%% in 3 months and by 85%% after 8 months, down to levels of before the mast year (9.9 seedlings m––²) after 16 months. Seedlings in the forest floor before the mast-seeding event showed a low relative growth rate −− 0.14 mm mm––¹ mo––¹ against 1.27 mm mm––¹ mo––¹ for seedlings that emerged immediately after masting. Seed germination was high (83%%) and rapid (L₅₀ == 7 days) following masting. Seedling growth was positively correlated with soil water content but not with temperatures and relative humidity. Data suggested that seed production in mast years is important in maintaining the seedling bank, and thus the viability of relict Fagus populations.Abbreviations: PAR == Photosynthetically active radiation; RGR == Relative growth rate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aseed germination 3acorrelation 3aseedling growth 3acanopy 3atropical montane cloud forests 3asoil water content 3arelative humidity 3aforest litter 3aseedlings 3avolcanoes 3aFagus grandifolia 3atrees 3atemperature 3amortality 3aMexico 0arecruitment 0aRelict species 0aBeech 0aMasting 0aMontane 0aTropics1 aWilliams-Linera, G.0 tJournal of vegetation science.g2002 Apr., v. 13, no. 2 p.179-184dOpulus Pressx1100-92337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1658%2F1100-9233%282002%29013%5B0179%3ASBDOFG%5D2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03296naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100001700169245008700186300001800273520177500291592002802066650001402094650001502108650001702123650001202140650001102152650002102163650001302184650001202197650001402209650002502223650001202248650002902260650002302289650003102312650003102343650002202374650002102396650002402417650001502441650003202456650001402488700001702502700001702519700002202536773009202558856008402650990002302734852000902757655001202766IND60087502120221121234626.0141102e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008750212DNAL7 a238511742pmid7 a10.1016/j.actbio.2013.07.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCohen, Benny10aGelatin–alginate novel tissue adhesives and their formulation–strength effects  ap. 9004-9011.  aInterest in tissue adhesives as alternatives for conventional wound-closing applications such as sutures and staples has increased in the last few decades due to numerous possible advantages, including less discomfort and lower cost. Novel tissue adhesives based on gelatin, with alginate as a polymeric additive and crosslinked by carbodiimide, were recently developed by our research group. The effects of the formulation parameters on the adhesives’ function were investigated in the current study. We examined the effects of gelatin and alginate concentrations and their viscosities on the ability of the bioadhesives to bind soft tissues. The effect of the crosslinking agent’s concentration was studied as well. A qualitative model describing these effects in terms of adherence mechanisms was developed. Our results show that the adherence properties of our new bioadhesives are achieved by a combination of two main mechanisms: mechanical interlocking and chemical adsorption. The former mechanism is probably more dominant. The polymer’s molecular weight and concentration affect the mechanical interlocking through mobility and penetration ability, entanglement of the three-dimensional structure and crosslinking density. The crosslinking agent’s concentration as well as the polymer’s concentration affect the crosslinking density and contribute to higher strength, achieved through both the mechanical interlocking and the chemical adsorption mechanisms. Understanding the effects of the adhesives’ components and their viscosities on the bonding strength enabled us to elucidate the bonding strength mechanisms. This can lead to proper selection of the adhesive formulation and may enable tailoring the bioadhesives to the desired applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesives 3aadsorption 3acrosslinking 3agelatin 3amodels 3amolecular weight 3apolymers 3asutures 3aviscosity 2aAlginatesxchemistry 2aAnimals 2aCarbodiimidesxchemistry 2aGelatinxchemistry 2aGlucuronic Acidxchemistry 2aHexuronic Acidsxchemistry 2aMaterials Testing 2aModels, Chemical 2aPolymersxchemistry 2aSus scrofa 2aTissue Adhesivesxchemistry 2aViscosity1 aPinkas, Oded1 aFoox, Maytal1 aZilberman, Meital0 tActa biomaterialia.g2013 Nov., v. 9, no. 11 p.9004-9011dElsevier Ltdx1742-70617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actbio.2013.07.0023Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02617naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245009000166520146600256592002801722650001301750650001301763650002501776650001501801650002401816650001201840650001901852650001301871651001001884653001301894653001701907653001301924653002901937700001401966700001601980700001601996773011502012856008302127852000902210655001202219IND60731531320221120081007.0210619e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073153132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ufug.2021.1270862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Pengwei14aThe motivation and factors influencing visits to small urban parks in Shanghai, China  aIn densely populated cities with high-rise buildings, large green spaces are a limited resource, and it is hard to visit large green spaces frequently due to long distance from places of residence. Small Urban Green Space (SUGS) in dense city areas might contribute to satisfy the need for everyday experiences of outdoor areas, but the study on SUGS use is limited, in particular in Asian contexts.The purpose of the study is to examine the effects of socio-demographic factors, personal factors, spatial attributes of residence, and satisfaction with park features on the use of SUGS and sources of motivation for visiting SUGS. Data were collected through face-to-face survey, and were analyzed using a hierarchical regression model. Results showed that relaxation and rest (36 %), physical exercise (23 %), and meeting friends (21 %) were the three most widespread reasons for SUGS use. The results indicated that socio-demographic factors, personal factors, spatial attributes of residence and park features factors explained 23 %, 2%, 25.6 % and 3% of the total variance in frequency of park visitation, respectively. Age, being willing to spend time in nature, with child under 7 years, noise and facility were positively correlated with SUGS use. Income,distance from home to the park, and residential green spaces were negatively correlated with SUGS use.Our findings are expected to assist urban planners in creating guidelines to better utilize SUGS.  aPublisher supplied data 3achildren 3aexercise 3agreen infrastructure 3amotivation 3aregression analysis 3asurveys 3aurban forestry 3avariance 3aChina 0aDistance 0aOlder adults 0aPark use 0aSmall Urban Green spaces1 aZhou, Bin1 aHan, Lirong1 aMeyiru̇ng,0 tUrban forestry & urban greening.g2021 May, v. 60 p.127086-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl893556x1618-86677nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ufug.2021.1270863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02495naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001500144245014200159300001600301500001900317520105900336592002801395650001401423650001401437650000901451650001301460650001701473650001801490650002401508650001601532650001001548650000901558650002301567650001101590650003201601650002301633653001401656653002501670653000801695700001601703700001701719700001601736700001201752700001701764700001401781773010601795856007901901852000901980655001201989IND60707751220221120132236.0210122e20200818xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070775122DNAL7 a10.1515/biol-2020-00612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTan, Shiyi10aLipopolysaccharides promote pulmonary fibrosis in silicosis through the aggravation of apoptosis and inflammation in alveolar macrophages  ap. 598-605.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAlveolar macrophages (AMs) play an important defensive role by removing dust and bacteria from alveoli. Apoptosis of AMs is associated with lung fibrosis; however, the relationship between this apoptotic event and environmental factors, such as the presence of lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) in the workplace, has not yet been addressed. To investigate whether exposure to LPS can exacerbate fibrosis, we collected AMs from 12 male workers exposed to silica and incubated them in the presence and absence of LPS for 24 h. We show that the levels of cleaved caspase-3 and pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha were increased in these AMs following LPS treatment. Moreover, we demonstrate that LPS exposure aggravated apoptosis and the release of inflammatory factors in AMs in a mouse model of silicosis, which eventually promoted pulmonary fibrosis. These results suggest that exposure to LPS may accelerate the progression of pulmonary fibrosis in silicosis by increasing apoptosis and inflammation in AMs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3acaspase-3 3adust 3afibrosis 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-6 3alipopolysaccharides 3amacrophages 3amales 3amice 3apulmonary fibrosis 3asilica 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3aworking conditions 0asilicosis 0aalveolar macrophages 0aLPS1 aYang, Shang1 aChen, Mingke1 aWang, Yurun1 aZhu, Li1 aSun, Zhiqian1 aChen, Shi0 tOpen life sciences.g2020 Aug. 18, v. 15, no. 1 p.598-605dDe GruyterwJournal:23145x2391-54127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1515/biol-2020-00613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02793naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002600139245008400165300001800249500001500267520125200282592002801534650001301562650002001575650000901595650001101604650001101615650000901626650001301635650001301648650001601661650001001677650001101687650001301698650001001711650001601721650001501737650001501752650002401767650001301791653003601804653003001840653002001870653001601890653002301906653001201929653002401941700003501965700002802000773012902028856007302157852000902230655001202239IND60530524320221117225631.0160721e20140505xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053052432DNAL7 a10.1021/sc500085m2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRadhika, Sri Parasara10aMo-Doped Cerium Gadolinium Oxide as Environmentally Sustainable Yellow Pigments  ap. 1251-1256.  a2019-12-06  aMo-doped Gd₁Ce₁–ₓO₃.₅₊Y (where x ranged from 0 to 0.3) oxides were synthesized as inorganic yellow pigments, which are benign and sustainable. The pigments exhibited good yellow color, with the yellowness value using the CIELAB 1976 system being around 39. In comparison to the existing reports on benign yellow pigments, which have been synthesized using high temperature calcination routes, this pigment has been synthesized through a low temperature sol–gel calcination route. The process also provided for a higher degree of size and shape control, leading to a bandgap of 2.82–2.52 eV. Size reduction to the nano level through the process provided a bottom up approach, where the presence of mineralizers enabled higher mass tone (b* value of around 80) at lower covering thickness. NIR solar reflectance, a measure of the ability of the pigment to contribute to energy savings by reflecting heat generating radiations of sunlight, was as high as 91%. The absence of toxic metal ions coupled with excellent chemical and thermal stabilities makes the developed pigment ideal for coloring plastics meant for children’s toys and ceramic surfaces that would come into immediate contact with human skin, such as bathroom tiles.  aPublisher supplied data 3atoxicity 3asolar radiation 3atoys 3acerium 3ahumans 3aheat 3achildren 3aplastics 3areflectance 3acolor 3aoxides 3aceramics 3atiles 3atemperature 3ametal ions 3agadolinium 3aenergy conservation 3apigments 0aDoped cerium−molybdenum oxide 0aNear-infrared reflectance 0aBenign pigments 0aCitrate gel 0aCIELAB coordinates 0areports 0aDiffuse reflectance1 aSreeram, Kalarical Janardhanan1 aUnni

Labile OM can stimulate the mineralization of soil organic matter (SOM); a phenomenon termed “priming.” In N‐poor subarctic soils, it is hypothesized that microorganisms may “prime” SOM in order to acquire N (microbial N‐mining). Increased leaf‐litter inputs with a high C/N ratio might further exacerbate microbial N demand, and increase the susceptibility of N‐poor soils to N‐mining. We investigated the N‐control of SOM mineralization by amending soils from climate change–simulation treatments in the subarctic (+1.1°C warming, birch litter addition, willow litter addition, and fungal sporocarp addition) with labile OM either in the form of glucose (labile C; equivalent to 400 µg C/g fresh [fwt] soil) or alanine (labile C + N; equivalent to 400 µg C and 157 µg N/g fwt soil), to simulate rhizosphere inputs. Surprisingly, we found that despite 5 yr of simulated climate change treatments, there were no significant effects of the field‐treatments on microbial process rates, community structure or responses to labile OM. Glucose primed the mineralization of both C and N from SOM, but gross mineralization of N was stimulated more than that of C, suggesting that microbial SOM use increased in magnitude and shifted to components richer in N (i.e., selective microbial N‐mining). The addition of alanine also resulted in priming of both C and N mineralization, but the N mineralization stimulated by alanine was greater than that stimulated by glucose, indicating strong N‐mining even when a source of labile OM including N was supplied. Microbial carbon use efficiency was reduced in response to both labile OM inputs. Overall, these findings suggest that shrub expansion could fundamentally alter biogeochemical cycling in the subarctic, yielding more N available for plant uptake in these N‐limited soils, thus driving positive plant–soil feedbacks.  aPublisher supplied data  a20150561cThe Crafoord Foundation  a2018‐01315cThe Swedish Research Council Formas  aKAW 2017.0171cThe Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation  aCTS16: 385cCarl Tryggers Foundation 3aBetula 3aalanine 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3acommunity structure 3afruiting bodies 3afungi 3aglucose 3alatitude 3amicrobial carbon 3amineralization 3arhizosphere 3ashrubs 3asoil organic matter 3asoil profiles1 aLeizeaga, Ainara1 aRousk, Kathrin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3140-98641 aMichelsen, Anders1 aRousk, Johannes1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4985-72620 tEcology.g2020 Sept., v. 101, no. 9 p.e03094-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl46164x0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecy.30943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03614naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245015100162300001600313520192600329592002802255650002402283650003002307650001602337650001602353650002102369650001102390650000902401650001302410650002402423650002002447650001602467650002302483650002102506650001302527650001202540650001002552650001002562650002502572650002302597650001502620650001002635653002202645653002402667653001402691653001202705700002602717700002502743700001902768700002502787700003502812773010602847856007402953852000903027655001203036IND60694881920221120134041.0210209e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069488192DNAL7 a10.3382/ps/pez4962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRamlucken, Uraisha12aA novel Bacillus based multi-strain probiotic improves growth performance and intestinal properties of Clostridium perfringens challenged broilers  ap. 331-341.  aThere is a necessity for the implementation of in-feed probiotics in the poultry production industry, following strict regulations around the use of antibiotic growth promoters (AGP). Bacillus spp. are becoming an attractive alternative because of their functionality and stability. This study aims to evaluate the effect of a novel multi-strain Bacillus based probiotic on growth performance and gut health in male Ross 308 broiler chickens challenged with Clostridium perfringens Type A. Broilers on a 4 phase feeding program were fed diets containing either a standard metabolizable energy (ME) (100%) or a reduced ME (98%) level. The test probiotic was compared to an un-supplemented negative control and a commercial benchmark product as positive control over a 35 D feeding trial, using a 2 × 3 factorial experimental design. Chicks were inoculated with a once-off dose of C. perfringens on day 14. Growth performance was measured weekly to calculate body weight (BW), feed intake (FI) and feed conversion ratio (FCR). Villi histomorphology, gut lesions, and liver weight were assessed at day 35. Broilers fed the reduced ME diet with the test probiotic achieved higher final BWs (P = 0.037) and FCR (P = 0.014) than the negative control. Broilers fed the standard ME diet with the test probiotic showed improved (P = 0.001) FCR than the negative control from day 21 onwards. Increased duodenal villi height (P = 0.012) and villi height to crypt depth ratio in the duodenum (P < 0.0001) and jejunum (P = 0.0004) were observed in broilers fed the reduced ME diet containing the test probiotic. Additionally, the test probiotic resulted in significantly reduced relative liver weights in both ME groups. Consequently, the results suggest that the novel multi-strain Bacillus based probiotic enhanced broiler performance and improved gut health and is thus attractive as an alternative to AGP's in broiler production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus (bacteria) 3aClostridium perfringens A 3aantibiotics 3abody weight 3abroiler chickens 3achicks 3adiet 3aduodenum 3aexperimental design 3afeed conversion 3afeed intake 3agrowth performance 3agrowth promotion 3aindustry 3ajejunum 3aliver 3amales 3ametabolizable energy 3apoultry production 3aprobiotics 3avilli 0aBacillus subtilis 0aBacillus velezensis 0aprobiotic 0abroiler1 aRamchuran, Santosh O.1 aMoonsamy, Ghaneshree1 aLalloo, Rajesh1 aThantsha, Mapitsi S.1 aJansen van Rensburg, Christine0 tPoultry science.g2020 Jan., v. 99, no. 1 p.331-341dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45501x0032-57917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps/pez4963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02199naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132100001100150245012100161300001600282520110300298592002801401650001501429650001801444650001701462650001101479650001201490650000701502650001801509650001701527700001401544700001601558700001301574700003701587700001801624773008801642856008601730852000901816655001201825IND4465441220221122131038.0141111e20120501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446544122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2011.11.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Ji10aSpectroscopic investigation on the interaction of 3,7-dihydroxyflavone with different isomers of human serum albumin  ap. 663-670.  aThe interaction mechanism of 3,7-dihydroxyflavone (3,7-diHF) and human serum albumin (HSA) was investigated by fluorescence quenching, fluorescence enhancement, steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence emission and UV–vis absorption spectrometry. The binding site of 3,7-diHF on protein was determined by investigating the spectroscopic properties of 3,7-diHF–HSA complex at pH 7.4 and pH 3.5 individually, and confirmed by the site marker competitive experiments. The binding parameters of 3,7-diHF–HSA complex were estimated by fluorescence quenching experiments, and the data were in good agreement with the results obtained from fluorescence enhancement measurements. A remarkable increase in the fluorescence anisotropy values suggested that 3,7-diHF bound at a motional restricted pocket on HSA. The results indicated that 3,7-diHF, in anionic form, was bound within the hydrophobic pockets of the subdomain IIA of HSA (site I), and stabilised mainly by electrostatic force and ionic interactions. The binding mode of drug–protein was discussed based on above experimental results.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3abinding sites 3afluorescence 3ahumans 3aisomers 3apH 3aserum albumin 3aspectroscopy1 aLiu, Yuan1 aZhen, Luan,1 aXie, Yue1 aWang, Liyunc(Writer on cooking)1 aXie, Meng-Xia0 tFood chemistry.g2012 May 1, v. 132, no. 1 p.663-670dElsevier Ltdx0308-81467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2011.11.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02594naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245009500168300001800263520137000281592002801651650001901679650002001698650001501718650002401733650001101757650001301768653002601781653002601807653003201833653001701865653002901882653001501911653001401926653002701940700001601967773011801983856008602101852000902187655001202196IND60747235520221119004339.0210816e20210803xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074723552DNAL7 a10.1080/08941920.2021.19315922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFudge, Maree10aRethinking Participation in Commons Governance: Political Representation and Participation  ap. 1038-1055.  aParticipatory practices are prominent strategies for increasing the legitimacy and effectiveness of resource commons governance. Despite increases in participatory practices legitimacy of such governance is in decline. Remaining commons are sites of conflict echoing wider disillusionment in democratic governance across mature liberal democracies. Much participatory governance literature argues that more involvement of citizens in deliberation and decision-making is the solution, turning away from representative practices to strengthen direct participation in commons governance. In this paper we draw on seminal work in political representation theory to examine legitimacy and political agency in participatory governance practices. We develop a conceptual lens drawing on key elements of: Hannah Pitkin’s The Concept of Representation; Michael Saward’s Representative Claim; and, Vivan Schmidt’s throughput model of legitimacy. The lens comprises three ‘conditions’ for analyzing how political agency of participants is constituted through institutional processes: authorization, dissent and exit, and accountability. We argue that this conceptual lens can serve the participatory turn in commons governance by enabling explicit consideration of the links between political participation and representation as foundations of democratic legitimacy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaccountability 3adecision making 3agovernance 3amathematical theory 3amodels 3apolitics 0aCitizen participation 0acommon pool resources 0anatural resource governance 0astakeholders 0apolitical representation 0alegitimacy 0ademocracy 0ainstitutional analysis1 aLeith, Peat0 tSociety & natural resources.g2021 Aug. 3, v. 34, no. 8 p.1038-1055dRoutledgewJournal:jnl45063x1521-07237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08941920.2021.19315923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03435naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245011400166300001400280520182400294592002802118650003502146650001602181650002502197650001502222650001302237650001502250650001302265650001302278650002502291650001402316650000902330650001102339650001102350650002302361651002502384653003102409653002402440653002302464653002502487653003202512700001602544700001502560700001402575700001402589700001302603700001602616700001502632700001602647700001302663773013302676856005102809852000902860655001202869IND50076241820221117204554.0140410e20120101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007624182DNAL7 a10.1080/00103624.2012.6314132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIbrikci, H.10aSpatial and Temporal Variability of Groundwater Nitrate Concentrations in Irrigated Mediterranean Agriculture  ap. 47-59.  aAs nitrogen (N) fertilizer-use efficiency rarely exceeds 50% in most agricultural systems, the potential leaching of N to the groundwater, particularly under irrigated conditions, has economic, health, and environmental implications. Research in the Akarsu irrigation district in the Lower Seyhan Plain in southern Turkey sought to determine spatial and temporal variability of groundwater (GW) nitrate (NO₃) concentrations in 2007–2008. Shallow groundwater observation wells 3 m deep were installed at different locations to represent the whole irrigation district. Groundwater samples were collected (February, April, July, October) and analyzed for ammonium (NH₄) and NO₃ concentrations. Because NH₄ values were negligible, only NO₃ data were processed to determine spatial and temporal variability and then used to develop regional NO₃ maps using geographic information systems. Groundwater NO₃ concentrations ranged between 0.17 and 55.96 mg L–¹ during the 2 years, only exceeding the critical 50 mg L–¹ concentration in 1% of the area sampled. The areal mean of NO₃ concentration was greatest in February, indicating a potential N leaching of unused N from the early season with intensive rainfall, especially in wheat-growing areas. Groundwater NO₃ concentrations decreased after February; however, during the peak irrigation season in July, NO₃ was relatively low because of crop uptake during spring and summer. In about half the area, groundwater NO₃ concentrations ranged between 20 and 50 mg L–¹ and were thus marginal relative to the critical pollution level. As N fertilizer use will continue to increase, especially with the expanded irrigation that is now occurring in the Mediterranean region, regular monitoring of groundwater NO₃ is advisable under such conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3ageographic information systems 3agroundwater 3airrigated conditions 3airrigation 3aleaching 3amonitoring 3anitrates 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fertilizers 3apollution 3arain 3aspring 3asummer 3atemporal variation 3aMediterranean region 0aDrainage observation wells 0agroundwater nitrate 0airrigation schemes 0aMediterranean region 0apotential nitrate pollution1 aÇetin, M.,1 aKarnez, E.1 aKirda, C.1 aTopcu, S.1 aRyan, J.1 aOztekin, E.1 aDingil, M.1 aKorkmaz, K.1 aOguz, H.0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g2012 Jan. 1, v. 43, no. 1-2 p.47-59dTaylor & Francis Groupx1532-24167nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00103624.2012.631413  aDNAL 7aarticle02579naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001400139245010200153300001800255520110400273592002801377650002101405650001301426650001601439650001401455650002201469650002201491650001801513650001801531650001101549650001701560653001801577653001601595653003501611653001601646653002701662653002701689700002001716700002701736700002301763700002201786700002201808700002301830700002101853773012901874856007302003852000902076655001202085IND60530524620221117225824.0160721e20140505xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053052462DNAL7 a10.1021/sc500088w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Hui10aPhysical Insight into Switchgrass Dissolution in Ionic Liquid 1-Ethyl-3-methylimidazolium Acetate  ap. 1264-1269.  aSmall-angle neutron scattering was used to characterize solutions of switchgrass and the constituent biopolymers cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin, as well as a physical mixture of them mimicking the composition of switchgrass, dissolved in the ionic liquid (IL) 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate. The results demonstrate that the IL dissolves the cellulose fibrils of switchgrass, although a supramolecular biopolymer network remains that is not present in solutions of the individual biopolymers and that does not self-assemble in a solution containing the physical mixture of the individual biopolymers. The persistence of a network-like structure indicates that dissolving switchgrass in the IL does not disrupt all of the physical entanglements and covalent linkages between the biopolymers created during plant growth. Reconstitution of the IL-dissolved switchgrass yields carbohydrate-rich material containing cellulose with a low degree of crystallinity, as determined by powder X-ray diffraction, which would impact potential downstream uses of the biopolymers produced by the process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPanicum virgatum 3aacetates 3abiopolymers 3acellulose 3acellulose fibrils 3acrystal structure 3ahemicellulose 3aionic liquids 3alignin 3aplant growth 0aIonic liquids 0aSwitchgrass 0aSmall-angle neutron scattering 0aBiopolymers 0aPhysical entanglements 0aBiomass deconstruction1 aGurau, Gabriela1 aPingali, Sai Venkatesh1 aO’Neill, Hugh M.1 aEvans, Barbara R.1 aUrban, Volker S.,1 aHeller, William T.1 aRogers, Robin D.0 tACS sustainable chemistry .g2014 May 05, v. 2, no. 5 p.1264-1269dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/sc500088w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04193naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245015200167520220200319592002802521650002702549650001902576650001902595650002002614650001502634650001102649650002902660650002102689650001802710650001702728650001202745650002302757650001602780650002202796650001302818650002402831650001402855650002002869650000702889650001302896650001302909650001902922650001102941650000902952650003202961650001102993650001303004651001003017653002203027653001903049653002303068653001903091653002203110653002003132700006103152700001503213700001603228700001703244700001503261700001803276773011803294856008603412852000903498655001203507IND60758397120221123030926.0220118e20220201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075839712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.1141512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPadhy, S.R.10aElucidation of dominant energy metabolic pathways of methane, sulphur and nitrogen in respect to mangrove-degradation for climate change mitigation  aMangroves play a key role in ecosystem balancing and climate change mitigation. It acts as a source and sink of methane (CH₄), a major greenhouse gas responsible for climate change. Energy metabolic pathways of methane production (methanogenesis) and oxidation (methanotrophy) are directly driven by sulphur (S) and nitrogen (N) metabolism and salinity in coastal wetlands. To investigate, how mangrove-degradations, affect the source-sink behaviour of CH₄; the pathways of CH₄, S and N were studied through whole-genome metagenomic approach. Soil samples were collected from degraded and undisturbed mangrove systems in Sundarban, India. Structural and functional microbial diversities (KEGG pathways) of CH₄, S and N metabolism were analysed and correlated with labile carbon pools and physico-chemical properties of soil. Overall, the acetoclastic pathway of methanogenesis was dominant. However, the relative proportion of conversion of CO₂ to CH₄ was more in degraded mangroves. Methane oxidation was higher in undisturbed mangroves and the serine pathway was dominant. After serine, the ribulose monophosphate pathway of CH₄ oxidation was dominant in degraded mangrove, while the xylulose monophosphate pathway was dominant in undisturbed site as it is more tolerant to salinity and higher pH. The assimilatory pathway (AMP) of S-metabolism was dominant in both systems. But in AMP pathway, adenosine triphosphate sulfurylase enzyme reads were higher in degraded mangrove, while NADPH-sulfite reductase abundance was higher in undisturbed mangrove due to higher salinity, and pH. In N-metabolism, the denitrification pathway was predominant in degraded sites, whereas the dissimilatory nitrate reduction pathway was dominant in undisturbed mangroves. The relative ratios of sulphur reducing bacteria (SRB): methanogens were higher in degraded mangrove; however, methanotrophs:methanogens was higher in undisturbed mangrove indicated lower source and greater sink capacity of CH₄ in the system. Microbial manipulation in mangrove-rhizosphere for regulating major energy metabolic pathways of methane could open-up a new window of climate change mitigation in coastal wetlands.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadenosine triphosphate 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate change 3adenitrification 3aecosystems 3aenergy 3aenvironmental management 3agreenhouse gases 3alabile carbon 3ametagenomics 3amethane 3amethane production 3amethanogens 3anitrate reduction 3anitrogen 3anitrogen metabolism 3aoxidation 3aoxidoreductases 3apH 3aribulose 3asalinity 3asalt tolerance 3aserine 3asoil 3asulfate adenylyltransferase 3asulfur 3axylulose 3aIndia 0aMethane oxidation 0aMethanogenesis 0aSulphate reduction 0aGHGs emissions 0aSoil carbon pools 0aSundarban-India1 aBhattacharyya, P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4007-43571 aDash, P.K.1 aNayak, S.K.1 aParida, S.P.1 aBaig, M.J.1 aMohapatra, T.0 tJournal of environmental management.g2022 Feb. 01, v. 303 p.114151-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.1141513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02585naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245011000170300001400280520162200294592002801916650002001944650001401964650001301978650001201991651002102003700002402024700001802048773008702066856008602153990002302239852000902262655001202271IND60092005320221118033929.0141103e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009200532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.buildenv.2011.10.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChoi, Joon-Ho10aImpacts of indoor daylight environments on patient average length of stay (ALOS) in a healthcare facility  ap. 65-75.  aThis study investigates how indoor environments with lighting during the day affect patients’ average length of stay (ALOS) in a hospital, by measuring and evaluating the daylight environments in patient rooms and comparing results to their ALOS. Patients’ ALOS data were compiled at a general hospital in Incheon, Korea, and the physical, environmental, and daylight conditions in the building were assessed. Data gathered were analyzed using a statistical package to determine the trends in the patients’ length of stay in hospital wards using 95% and 90% statistical significance levels. The data were categorized based on the orientation of each patient’s room and the positions of the heads of their beds in relation to window views. Comparisons were made between the different orientations of patient rooms in each ward of the selected hospital. The variables considered in this study were: each patient’s average length of stay as an index of health outcome, and the differences in environments during daylight hours, including illuminance, luminance ratio, and diversity of illuminance in the patient rooms of the hospitals. This study considered how these components affected patients’ ALOS in the hospitals. It discusses the relationship between indoor daylight environments and ALOS, as well as the seasonal weather factor effect on indoor daylight that could potentially influence the patients’ length of stay. This study can serve as a basis for the development of recommendations for designing patient rooms in healthcare facilities that will result in more effective healing environments.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahealth services 3ahospitals 3apatients 3aweather 3aKorean Peninsula1 aBeltran, Liliana O.1 aKim, Hway-Suh0 tBuilding and environment.g2012 Apr., v. 50 p.65-75dElsevier Ltdx0360-13237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2011.10.0103Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03380naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245016300171300001400334520160500348592002801953650002901981650001202010650001202022650001202034650002402046650002502070650001402095650001302109650002102122650002002143650001202163650001602175650002202191650002202213650000902235650000902244650001402253650001102267650001502278650001402293650001702307650001102324650001802335650002802353650001502381651001502396653003602411653002802447653002102475653004402496653004102540773011802581856008202699852000902781655001202790IND60565883220221119072817.0180905e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056588322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gsd.2017.03.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHowladar, M.

In this study, the Hill-piper diagram, ratio plots and cross plots were used to recognize the various hydrogeochemical mechanisms involved in the evolution of the water chemistry and quality around the area. The basic statistics, IQR value, correlation matrix, cluster analysis were appealed to implicate the complex interrelationships between the ionic components of water. The principal component (PC) and factor analysis (FA) were computed to detect the possible source of water environmental pollution influenced either by natural or multiple anthropogenic sources like BTPP, existing agriculture activity and so on. The Hill-piper diagram presents two distinct hydrochemical facies such as CaHCO3 and Ca-Mg-Cl facies. The PC/FA revealed that three principal components explained about 63.63% of the total variability. The factor 2 indicated active mixing environmental process like natural and anthropogenic influence. Whereas the high positive loading ions like SiO2, Cr³⁺, PO³⁻4, As³⁺, Cd²⁺ and Fe³⁺ of factors 1 and 3 represent the existence of industrial waste like BTPP while waste water with fly ash has high affinity with such components of water bodies. Thus these results confirmed that discharged from BTPP is the possible source of water environmental pollution for present and future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropogenic activities 3aarsenic 3acadmium 3acalcium 3acalcium bicarbonate 3achemical composition 3achlorides 3achromium 3acluster analysis 3afactor analysis 3afly ash 3agroundwater 3ahydrogeochemistry 3aindustrial wastes 3aions 3airon 3amagnesium 3amixing 3aphosphates 3apollution 3apower plants 3asilica 3asurface water 3asustainable development 3awastewater 3aBangladesh 0aBarapukuria Thermal Power Plant 0aSurface water chemistry 0aCluster analysis 0aPrincipal component and factor analyses 0aWater environmental pollution source0 tGroundwater for sustainable development.g2017 Sept., v. 5 p.38-48dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23351x2352-801X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gsd.2017.03.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02475naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245008100174300001800255520106000273536018701333592002801520650002301548650001301571650002101584650001301605650002201618650003201640650001301672650001101685650001201696651002101708653002401729653001601753653001501769653001301784700002201797700002101819773011801840856008601958852000902044655001202053IND60747235720221119004659.0210816e20210803xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074723572DNAL7 a10.1080/08941920.2021.19363182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTrimbach, David J.10aSalish Sea Survey: Geographic Literacy Enhancing Natural Resource Management  ap. 1147-1154.  aThe Salish Sea is a biodiverse, transboundary inland sea and marine ecosystem stretching from British Columbia, Canada into Washington State, United States. Home to nearly eight million people and charismatic and keystone species, including three populations of orca, the ecosystem crosses multiple jurisdictions, communities, and watersheds, complicating conservation efforts. Geographic literacy, especially place names, is important for managing Salish Sea recovery and further challenged by the newness of the Salish Sea as an officially recognized place name. We conducted a geographic literacy survey showing that residents are largely unfamiliar with the name Salish Sea. Such low geographic literacy has numerous negative implications for communications, advocacy, outreach and the ability to address natural resource management and recovery of the Salish Sea at the level of the ecosystem. We offer potential implications for geographic literacy and other complementary geographic constructs within the wider field of natural resource management.  aSurvey implementation and data tabulation were supported by the SeaDoc Society, a program of the Karen C.

GAGs constitute a significant portion of the extracellular matrix and have a significant impact on regulating cellular behavior, either directly or through encapsulation and presentation of growth factors to the cells. In this study we utilized a supramolecular peptide nanofiber system that can emulate both the nanofibrous architecture of collagenous extracellular matrix and the major chemical composition found on GAGs. GAGs and collagen mimetic peptide nanofibers were designed and synthesized with sulfonate and carboxylate groups on the peptide scaffold. The GAG mimetic peptide nanofibers interact with bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2), which is a critical growth factor for osteogenic activity. The GAG mimicking ability of the peptide nanofibers and their interaction with BMP-2 promoted osteogenic activity and mineralization by osteoblastic cells. Alkaline phosphatase activity, Alizarin red staining and energy dispersive X-ray analysis spectroscopy indicated the efficacy of the peptide nanofibers in inducing mineralization. The multifunctional and bioactive microenvironment presented here provides osteoblastic cells with osteogenic stimuli similar to those observed in native bone tissue.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalizarin 3aalkaline phosphatase 3abioactive properties 3achemical composition 3acollagen 3aencapsulation 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3aextracellular matrix 3aglycosaminoglycans 3agrowth factors 3amineralization 3ananofibers 3aspectroscopy 3atissue repair 2aAlkaline Phosphatasexmetabolism 2aBiocompatible Materialsxpharmacology 2aBiomimetic Materialsxpharmacology 2aBone Morphogenetic Protein 2xmetabolism 2aCalcification, Physiologicxdrug effects 2aCell Line, Tumor 2aCell Proliferationxdrug effects 2aCell Shapexdrug effects 2aCell Survivalxdrug effects 2aCircular Dichroism 2aGlycosaminoglycansxpharmacology 2aHumans 2aNanofibersxchemistryxultrastructure. 2aOsteogenesisxdrug effects 2aPeptidesxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aProtein Bindingxdrug effects 2aSpectrometry, X-Ray Emission 2aSpectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared 2aSurface-Active Agentsxchemistryxpharmacology.1 aCeylan, Hakan1 aTekinay, Ayse B.1 aGuler, Mustafa O.0 tActa biomaterialia.g2013 Nov., v. 9, no. 11 p.9075-9085dElsevier Ltdx1742-70617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actbio.2013.07.0073Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03875naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005900151245011500210520209000325592002802415650001302443650002602456650002402482650002002506650001502526650002902541650002602570650001902596650001502615650001402630650002502644650002002669650001302689650001802702650001302720650002202733650001302755650002102768650002302789650001802812650001302830651001502843653002402858653002102882653002102903653000902924653001802933700002402951700006102975700006003036773011803096856008603214852000903300655001203309IND60758397320221123030954.0220118e20220201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075839732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.1141532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJones, Scott F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1056-378510aSeasonal impoundment management reduces nitrogen cycling but not resilience to surface fire in a tidal wetland  aHydrology and salinity regimes of many impounded wetlands are manipulated to provide seasonal habitats for migratory waterfowl, with little-known consequences for ecosystem structure and function. Managed hydrology can alter ecosystems by directly changing soil properties and processes and by influencing plant community dynamics. Additionally, management history may influence ecosystem response to disturbance, including fires. To better understand how wetland management regime influences ecosystem response to disturbance, we quantified elevation, soil nitrogen concentrations and process rates, and plant community structure and diversity in a natural experiment following the 2018 Branscombe Fire. We measured paired burned-unburned patches in both tidally-influenced and managed, seasonally-impounded wetlands in Suisun Marsh, California, USA. Unburned ecosystem structure and nutrient cycling differed by wetland management history; unburned impounded wetlands were ∼1 m lower in elevation and plant community composition was dominated by succulents whereas the unburned tidal wetland was dominated by graminoids. Unburned impounded wetland soil nitrogen cycling (potential nitrification and denitrification) rates were <28% of those measured in unburned tidal wetland soils and soil extractable nitrate, ammonium, and dissolved inorganic phosphorus concentrations were also substantially lower in unburned impounded than unburned tidal wetlands. Despite these differences in pre-disturbance (i.e., unburned) conditions, all soil processes recovered to baseline levels within 6 months after surface fire, and we found no evidence of plant community change 1 year after fire in either wetland management type. Overall, water management history exerted stronger control on ecosystem processes and structure than surface fire disturbance. Low extractable soil nitrate and potential denitrification rates may indicate limitation of soil nitrogen removal in impounded wetlands, with implications for downstream environmental quality and eutrophication across managed landscapes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium 3abotanical composition 3acommunity structure 3adenitrification 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental management 3aenvironmental quality 3aeutrophication 3agraminoids 3ahydrology 3ainorganic phosphorus 3amigratory birds 3anitrates 3anitrification 3anitrogen 3aplant communities 3asalinity 3awater management 3awetland management 3awetland soils 3awetlands 3aCalifornia 0aWetland impoundment 0aNitrogen cycling 0aNitrogen removal 0aFire 0aTidal wetland1 aSchutte, Charles A.1 aRoberts, Brian J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6366-31651 aThorne, Karen M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1381-06570 tJournal of environmental management.g2022 Feb. 01, v. 303 p.114153-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.1141533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04158naa a2200793 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003800135040001800173100001300191245016900204300001800373520150100391592002801892650001701920650001401937650001801951650002001969650001201989650001602001650002302017650001902040650001302059650001102072650000902083650001502092650001702107650002302124650001802147650001202165650002902177650005802206650007402264650003202338650001502370650003202385650003302417650004102450650001102491650004402502650001102546650002902557650002502586650003002611650005402641650004202695650005202737650004502789650000902834650002502843650004002868650003502908650005702943650003203000700002503032700001203057700001703069700002103086700002003107700001703127773009203144856008403236990002303320852000903343655001203352IND60087502820221121234731.0141102e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008750282DNAL7 a238112172pmid7 aPMC37911822pmcid7 a10.1016/j.actbio.2013.06.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Kedi10aThiol-ene Michael-type formation of gelatin/poly(ethylene glycol) biomatrices for three-dimensional mesenchymal stromal/stem cell administration to cutaneous wounds  ap. 8802-8814.  aMesenchymal stromal/stem cells (MSCs) are considered promising cellular therapeutics in the fields of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. MSCs secrete high concentrations of immunomodulatory cytokines and growth factors, which exert paracrine effects on infiltrating immune and resident cells in the wound microenvironment that could favorably promote healing after acute injury. However, better spatial delivery and improved retention at the site of injury are two factors that could improve the clinical application of MSCs. In this study, we utilized thiol-ene Michael-type addition for rapid encapsulation of MSCs within a gelatin/poly(ethylene glycol) biomatrix. This biomatrix was also applied as a provisional dressing to full thickness wounds in Sprague–Dawley rats. The three-way interaction of MSCs, gelatin/poly(ethylene glycol) biomatrices, and host immune cells and adjacent resident cells in the wound microenvironment favorably modulated wound progression and host response. In this model we observed attenuated immune cell infiltration, lack of foreign giant cell (FBGC) formation, accelerated wound closure and re-epithelialization, as well as enhanced neovascularization and granulation tissue formation by 7days. The MSC entrapped in the gelatin/poly(ethylene glycol) biomatrix localized cell presentation adjacent to the wound microenvironment and thus mediated the early resolution of inflammatory events and facilitated the proliferative phases in wound healing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aangiogenesis 3acytokines 3aencapsulation 3aethylene glycol 3agelatin 3agiant cells 3agranulation tissue 3agrowth factors 3amedicine 3amodels 3arats 3astem cells 3atherapeutics 3atissue engineering 3atissue repair 2aAnimals 2aAntigens, CDxmetabolism 2aAntigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocyticxmetabolism 2aBiocompatible Materialsxchemical synthesisxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aBone Marrow Cellsxcytology 2aCell Count 2aCell Survivalxdrug effects 2aCells, Immobilizedxcytology 2aEpitheliumxdrug effectsxpathology. 2aFemale 2aGelatinxchemical synthesisxchemistry. 2aHumans 2aHydrogelsxpharmacology. 2aImmunohistochemistry 2aInjections, Intramuscular 2aMacrophagesxdrug effectsxmetabolismxpathology. 2aMesenchymal Stem Cell Transplantation 2aMesenchymal Stem Cellsxcytologyxdrug effects. 2aPolyethylene Glycolsxchemical synthesis 2aRats 2aRats, Sprague-Dawley 2aReceptors, Cell Surfacexmetabolism 2aSkinxdrug effectsxpathology. 2aSulfhydryl Compoundsxchemical synthesisxchemistry. 2aWound Healingxdrug effects1 aCantu, David Antonio1 aFu, Yao1 aKim, Jaehyup1 aZheng, Xiaoxiang1 aHematti, Peiman1 aKao, W.

This raises the stakes significantly as there is no reliance on the infinite storage that the grid provides, but only on the local energy storage. Overall reliability and resilience are the basic demands that need to be satisfied by the design and system sizing. We investigate a special aspect of power reliability, arguing that maintaining thermal comfort and guaranteeing power availability will be the two most important performance indicators in an off-grid house design. Due to the dynamic characteristic of a renewable energy generation system it is often difficult to maintain a stable thermal comfort level without investing in an oversized renewable power system. This paper presents a stochastic model based energy management system that distributes energy based on acceptable ranges of thermal comfort levels and manages electricity storage in batteries, driven by the projected energy demand and the projected energy generation. The objective of the stochastic model based control is to guide system operation and reach a balance between acceptable thermal comfort and general power reliability in an off-grid residence. Simulation results indicate that the proposed stochastic model based controller decreases the risk of power unavailability by up to 24% without sacrificing indoor thermal comfort dramatically. A follow-up sensitivity analysis demonstrates versatilities of the controller in practical application. Certain limitations in its application are discussed at the end of this paper.  aPublisher supplied data 3abatteries 3aelectricity 3aenergy 3arenewable energy sources 3arisk 3astochastic processes 3asystems engineering1 aAugenbroe, Godfried0 tBuilding and environment.g2012 Apr., v. 50 p.90-103dElsevier Ltdx0360-13237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2011.10.0113Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03295naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245015600175300001300331520193000344592002802274650001402302650001302316650001902329650001902348650001802367650001302385650001502398650004302413650001602456650001902472650001302491653001202504653001402516653001502530653001802545773024002563856008502803852000902888655001202897IND60634251820221120154858.0190516e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063425182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.repbio.2019.03.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHamad, Mohammed Faiz10aQuantification of histones and protamines mRNA transcripts in sperms of infertile couples and their impact on sperm’s quality and chromatin integrity  ap. 6-13.  aThe proper transition of histones to protamine during spermiogenesis is critical for male fertility. This study aimed to quantify the levels of histones and protamines mRNA in sperms of infertile couples and their possible effect on the sperm’s quality and chromatin integrity. Spermatozoa from 53 normal and 75 patients were enrolled in this study. Histones and Protamine mRNAs were extracted, reverse-transcribed and applied to real-time quantitative PCR. Chromomycin A3 staining was used to assess protamination and chromatin integrity, and Eosin-Nigrosine-Test and HOS-Test was used to evaluate the sperm’s vitality and membrane integrity respectively. Levels of histones H2A and H2B mRNA in patient’s sperms were significantly (p < 0.01) higher than that of normal (31.22 ± 2.91, 30.03 ± 2.05 vs. 25.62 ± 1.98, 27.23 ± 3.04, respectively). Protamine PRM2 mRNA in patient’s sperms (20.55 ± 2.01) was significantly lower than in normal (21.73 ± 2.64, p < 0.01). The PRM1/PRM2 and H2A/H2B mRNAs ratios were significantly higher (p < 0.01) in patients than normal (1.02 ± 0.10, 1.04 ± 0.07 vs. 0.98 ± 0.06, 0.94 ± 0.08 respectively). Also, the sperm’s nuclear histones to protamines transcripts ((H2A + H2B)/(PRM1 + PRM2)) ratios of patients (1.49 ± 0.16) was significantly higher (p < 0.01) than that of normal (1.25 ± 0.15). Histone/protamine transcripts [((H2A + H2B)/(PRM1 + PRM2)) mRNAs ratios] were negatively correlated (p < 0.05) with sperm’s count, total count, motility, progressive motility, normal morphology, membrane integrity and positively with chromatin decondensation. The data suggests that histones/protamines mRNAs ratios are important for a sperm’s quality and therefore could be used as predictors for male infertility. Also, validation study may be required to confirm the study conclusion.  aPublisher supplied data 3achromatin 3ahistones 3amale fertility 3amale sterility 3amessenger RNA 3apatients 3aprotamines 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aspermatozoa 3aspermiogenesis 3astaining 0aHistone 0aProtamine 0aTranscript 0aSperm quality0 tReproductive Biology.g2019 Mar., v. 19, no. 1 p.6-13dElsevier B.V.aSociety for Biology of Reproduction & the Institute of Animal Reproduction and Food Research of Polish Academy of Sciences in OlsztynwJournal:23206x1642-431X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.repbio.2019.03.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02991naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003200150245011400182300001600296520169400312592002802006650001902034650001402053650001202067650001402079650001302093650001502106650002002121650000902141650001502150650001502165651001202180653001202192653001102204653001602215653001202231653001202243700001902255700002002274700002402294700002002318773013502338856005102473852000902524655001202533IND50076242320221117204603.0140410e20120101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007624232DNAL7 a10.1080/00103624.2012.6346942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMáthé-Gáspár, Gabriella10aCharacteristics of Surface Nitrogen and Phosphorus Balances in the Seven Regions of Hungary from 1989 to 2005  ap. 112-120.  aAs a result of Hungary's membership in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), surface nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) balances on a country level are calculated and reported to the OECD annually. The Research Institute for Soil Science and Agricultural Chemistry (RISSAC) of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences is responsible for the calculations. Surface nutrient NP balances of each of the seven Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS) 2 regions of Hungary were calculated for the period of 1989 (the starting year of political and economic transitions in the country) to 2005. For the environmental risk assessment of NP balances, it is also essential to take the soil NP status of the investigated area into consideration. Correlations between NP balances and soil NP status should be investigated on EU, country, or regional levels. The relevant agricultural databases of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary (CSOH) were used to ensure the accurate estimations of coefficients. Significant differences were found among the regions both in the input and output sides of the NP balances and, as a consequence, in the regional NP balances. Utilization of the agricultural area also differs among the regions, as a consequence of their geographical location, terrain features, soil and climate conditions, and different traditions. In general, the annual N balances of the studied period in the Hungarian regions were positive, whereas P balances were negative. Surface gross nutrient NP balances of each of the seven Hungarian regions decreased in the studied period, but characteristic differences between Hungarian regions still remained.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3achemistry 3aclimate 3adatabases 3anitrogen 3aphosphorus 3arisk assessment 3asoil 3astatistics 3atraditions 3aHungary 0aHungary 0ainputs 0aNP balances 0aoutputs 0aregions1 aFodor, Nandor,1 aCsathó, Péter1 aRadimszky, László1 aNémeth, Tamás0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g2012 Jan. 1, v. 43, no. 1-2 p.112-120dTaylor & Francis Groupx1532-24167nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00103624.2012.634694  aDNAL 7aarticle03577naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005700139245014000196300001600336520194300352592002802295650002402323650001902347650002102366650001602387650002102403650001502424650001902439650000902458650002002467650001602487650002802503650001602531650001502547650001402562650001502576650001202591650001602603653002402619653002402643653002802667653001602695653002302711700001602734700001402750700001602764700001802780700001902798700001702817773010602834856007402940852000903014655001203023IND60694882520221120134038.0210209e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069488252DNAL7 a10.3382/ps/pez5122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSlawinska, A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5706-614510aImpact of galactooligosaccharides delivered in ovo on mitigating negative effects of heat stress on performance and welfare of broilers  ap. 407-415.  aGalactooligosaccharides (GOS) delivered in ovo improve intestinal health of broiler chickens. This study aimed to demonstrate the impact of in ovo stimulation with GOS prebiotic on day 12 of egg incubation on performance and welfare traits in broiler chickens. The incubating eggs were divided into 3 groups, based on the substance injected in ovo: 3.5 mg of GOS dissolved in 0.2 mL physiological saline (GOS), 0.2 mL physiological saline (S), or uninjected controls (C). Constant heat stress (HS) was induced on days 32 to 42 post-hatch by increasing environmental temperature to 30°C. Thermoneutral (TN) animals were kept at 25°C. The performance (body weight [BW], daily feed intake [DFI], daily weight gain [DWG], and feed conversion rate [FCR]) were measured and mortality was scored for starter (days 0 to 13), grower (days 14 to 27), and finisher (days 28 to 42) feeding phases. Rectal temperature was scored on days 32 to 42. Food-pad dermatitis (FPD) was scored post-mortem (day 42). GOS increased (P < 0.01) BW on day 42 (2.892 kg in GOS vs. 2.758 kg in C). Heat stress significantly reduced (P < 0.01) final BW (2.516 kg in TN vs. 3.110 kg in HS). During finisher phase, DFI was significantly higher in GOS vs. C (173.2 g vs. 165.7 g; P < 0.05). FCR calculated for the entire rearing period (days 0 to 42) ranged from 1.701 in C to 1.653 in GOS (P < 0.05). GOS improved FCR in HS animals during finisher phase (P < 0.05). Rectal temperature of GOS chickens under HS reached 42.5°C 1 day earlier than C and S (P < 0.05), which suggests that those birds recovered earlier from the high environmental temperature. Heat stress increased (P < 0.05) mortality about 5 times compared to TN during finisher phase (from 1.59% in TN to 7.69% in HS). GOS decreased FPD in TN conditions by 20% (no lesions in 81% in GOS vs. 60% in C). GOS delivered in ovo mitigated negative effects of HS on performance and welfare in broiler chickens.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3aanimal welfare 3abody temperature 3abody weight 3abroiler chickens 3adermatitis 3aegg incubation 3aeggs 3afeed conversion 3afeed intake 3agalactooligosaccharides 3aheat stress 3aintestines 3amortality 3aprebiotics 3arearing 3aweight gain 0abroiler performance 0afood-pad dermatitis 0agalactooligosaccharides 0aheat stress 0ain ovo stimulation1 aZampiga, M.1 aSirri, F.1 aMeluzzi, A.1 aBertocchi, M.1 aTavaniello, S.1 aMaiorano, G.0 tPoultry science.g2020 Jan., v. 99, no. 1 p.407-415dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45501x0032-57917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps/pez5123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02324naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245010800168300001800276520104700294592002801341650001101369650001701380650002001397650002901417650001401446650001601460650001301476650002501489650001301514651001401527653002601541653002701567653001601594653001401610653002001624700002301644700002201667773011801689856008601807852000901893655001201902IND60747236020221119004941.0210816e20210803xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074723602DNAL7 a10.1080/08941920.2021.19423502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLai, Jia Yen10aTransmigrants Experiences of Recognitional (in)Justice in Indonesia’s Environmental Impact Assessment  ap. 1056-1074.  aThis paper unpacks the environmental justice concerns of rural migrants in relation to land tenure and Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) processes. We explore the “geography of recognition”, whereby sense of community, identity and place interact to produce unequal experiences of recognitional justice in relation to the EIA process. We develop our argument by using qualitative research and a village case study in East Kalimantan, Indonesia, involving transmigrant communities and indigenous Kutai people. This study highlights how a failure to recognize transmigrants’ identity creates barriers to their meaningful participation in the EIA. Structural flaws in the decentralized land-use system mean a failure to address the contested claims for recognition and land rights between transmigrant and indigenous communities, which in turn fuels social and environmental conflict. Resolving land tenure conflicts requires the empowerment of socially marginalized groups in the decision-making over land-use projects affecting them.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBorneo 3acase studies 3adecision making 3aenvironmental assessment 3ageography 3aland tenure 3aland use 3aqualitative analysis 3avillages 3aIndonesia 0aEnvironmental justice 0aindigenous land rights 0arecognition 0amigration 0aforest politics1 aHamilton, Alistair1 aStaddon, Samantha0 tSociety & natural resources.g2021 Aug. 3, v. 34, no. 8 p.1056-1074dRoutledgewJournal:jnl45063x1521-07237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08941920.2021.19423503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03462naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245009900166300001600265520163400281592002801915650002301943650001601966650001301982650002101995650001502016650001102031650001302042650001302055650001902068650001402087650002602101650001502127650001502142650001302157650001302170650001302183650001302196653001902209653002802228653001802256653002102274653001902295653002002314653001502334653002502349653001302374653002202387700002002409700001602429700001802445700001502463700001802478700006402496700005902560773012502619856008302744852000902827655001202836IND60674802320221118033752.0200228e20200215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067480232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2019.10.0662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShah, Smit A.10aAramid nanofiber-reinforced three-dimensional graphene hydrogels for supercapacitor electrodes  ap. 581-588.  aSelf-assembled graphene hydrogels are notable in the field of electrochemical energy storage for their unique combination of excellent specific surface area, high porosity, and electrically conductive continuous network. However, graphene hydrogels suffer from poor mechanical integrity compared to layered architectures like graphene buckypapers, limiting their applications in practical devices. We propose the use of high strength, Kevlar®-derived polymeric nanofillers, aramid nanofibers (ANFs) as structural fillers to enhance graphene hydrogel’s shear modulus in the context of multifunctional (mechanical and electrochemical) architectures.Graphene hydrogels are fabricated using sol-gel self-assembly of graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets in presence of ammonium hydroxide. Colloidal dispersion of ANFs and GO are integrated using a novel combination of solvent exchange and dialysis approach to fabricate GO-ANF hydrogels with 0–15 wt.% of ANFs loading (dry weight basis). Shear modulus and electrochemical properties of resulting hydrogel composites are evaluated using rheology and symmetric supercapacitor cell.The addition of 2 wt.% ANFs resulted in an 80% improvement in shear modulus compared to neat graphene hydrogel. Addition of ANFs resulted in gradual reduction of specific capacitance, with the specific capacitance of 190 F/g for neat graphene hydrogel, reducing to 128 F/g for an ANF loading of 15 wt.% (dry weight basis). This work shows the broader concept that adding high-strength nanofibers to a nanomaterial gel can add reinforcement provided that the gelation process itself is not disrupted.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium hydroxide 3acapacitance 3adialysis 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aenergy 3agelation 3agraphene 3agraphene oxide 3ahydrogels 3amodulus of elasticity 3ananofibers 3ananosheets 3apolymers 3aporosity 3arheology 3asolvents 0aGraphene oxide 0aColloidal nanomaterials 0aSelf-assembly 0aElectrochemistry 0aEnergy storage 0aSupercapacitors 0aNanofibers 0aStructural materials 0aRheology 0aSol-gel chemistry1 aKulhanek, Devon1 aSun, Wanmei1 aZhao, Xiaofei1 aYu, Saerom1 aParviz, Dorsa1 aLutkenhaus, Jodie L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2613-60161 aGreen, Micah J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5691-08610 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2020 Feb. 15, v. 560 p.581-588dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2019.10.0663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03256naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001600149245013600165500001400301520177700315592002802092650002002120650001002140650002502150650001602175650001102191650001202202650001102214650001802225650001502243650002002258650001102278650001302289650001602302650001902318650001802337650002102355650001202376650001602388700003902404700002602443700002202469700002302491700002302514773013302537856008302670852000902753655001202762IND60707752420221120122059.0200821e20200801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070775242DNAL7 a10.3390/agriculture100803172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Liyun 10aDifferences in the Growth and Physiological Responses of the Leaves of Peucedanum japonicum and Hordeum vulgare Exposed to Salinity  aNAL-light  aSoil salinity has emerged as one of the most prominent threats to modern intensive farming systems, and it has necessitated the cultivation of halophytes to ensure food security and human nutrition. Peucedanum japonicum Thunb. is an edible wild plant with medicinal value that is widely distributed along the Pacific coast of western Japan. However, the adaptive mechanisms of this plant with respect to salt stress tolerance have not yet to be elucidated. The purpose of this study was to compare the physiological responses of P. japonicum to salt stress with those of barley (Hordeum vulgare), which is considered a salinity-tolerant plant. Seedlings of both species at the same height were exposed to different concentrations (0, 50, 75, and 150 mM) of NaCl for 16 days, after which the leaves were analyzed with respect to different physiological parameters. The results revealed a maintenance of leaf growth in P. japonicum compared with that in barley, the growth of which was severely impaired at low concentrations of NaCl (50 and 75 mM). In response to salt stress, a higher suppression of Na⁺ and Cl⁻ assimilations was observed in P. japonicum than in barley under all NaCl treatments. Moreover, P. japonicum showed a greater ability to maintain leaf K⁺ and Ca²⁺ concentrations, whereas barley exhibited a significant reduction in the concentrations of these ions under saline conditions. Thus, the superior salinity tolerance of P. japonicum could be attributed to a more efficient maintenance of ionic balances. Taken together, our results indicate that P. japonicum may be classified as a halophyte, given its superior regulation of K⁺, Ca²⁺, SO₄⁻, and sucrose concentrations and lower NO₃⁻ concentrations compared with those of barley.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHordeum vulgare 3aJapan 3aPeucedanum japonicum 3aagriculture 3abarley 3acalcium 3acoasts 3afood security 3ahalophytes 3ahuman nutrition 3aleaves 3asalinity 3asalt stress 3asalt tolerance 3asoil salinity 3astress tolerance 3asucrose 3awild plants1 aJohnson, Yuki N.q(Yuki Nakamura),1 aTaliman, Nisar  Ahmad1 aSabagh, Ayman  EL1 aMoghaieb, Reda  EA1 aSaneoka, Hirofumi 0 tAgriculture (Basel).g2020 Aug. 01, v. 10, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12387x2077-04727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agriculture100803173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03493naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001500139245014400154300001600298520194100314592002802255650001802283650001302301650001602314650002302330650001602353650001602369650001602385650001302401650001802414650001602432650001402448650000902462650001902471650001402490650001202504650001402516650002402530650001202554650001402566653001402580653002402594653002002618653001602638653001402654700001102668700001602679700001502695700001402710700001402724773010602738856007402844852000902918655001202927IND60694882620221120133818.0210209e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069488262DNAL7 a10.3382/ps/pez5132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, M.J.10aTargeted disruption of TORC1 retards young squab growth by inhibiting the synthesis of crop milk protein in breeding pigeon (Columba livia)  ap. 416-422.  aThis study was conducted to explore the regulatory role of the target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1) signaling pathway in crop milk synthesis in breeding pigeons (Columba livia). Three groups of breeding pigeons in the lactation period (n = 30 pairs/group) were respectively injected with rapamycin (RAPA, a specific inhibitor of the target of rapamycin complex) at doses of 0 (vehicle, control), 0.6, or 1.2 mg/kg body weight (BW)/day via the wing vein for 7 days. The average daily feed intake (ADFI) and BW of the breeding pigeons and the BW of young squabs were respectively recorded throughout the experimental period. The breeding pigeons were sacrificed to collect their crop tissues, crop milk, and serum on the eighth day of the experiment. The results showed that neither 0.6 nor 1.2 mg/kg BW RAPA injection affected BW loss or ADFI in breeding pigeons (P > 0.05), while crop thickness and crop relative weight were significantly decreased (P < 0.05) in the 1.2 mg/kg BW rapamycin-injected group. Simultaneously, RAPA (especially at 1.2 mg/kg BW) decreased the crude protein, αₛ₁-casein, αₛ₂-casein, β-casein, and amino acid contents (Asp, Thr, Ser, Glu, Gly, Ala, Cys, Val, Met, Ile, Leu, Tyr, Lys, His, Arg, and Pro) of crop milk (P < 0.05) and the concentrations of albumin, total protein, and uric acid in the serum of breeding pigeons (P < 0.05). Additionally, the expression of TORC1 pathway-related proteins (TORC1, S6K1, S6, 4EBP1, and eIF4E) was downregulated in the crop tissues of breeding pigeons by 0.6 or 1.2 mg/kg BW/day RAPA injection (P < 0.05). Accordingly, the average daily gain (ADG) of young squabs declined, and the mortality rate increased significantly (P < 0.05). Together, the results showed that RAPA reduced protein and amino acid levels in the crop milk of breeding pigeons and retarded young squab growth, suggesting a crucial role of TORC1 in crop milk synthesis in breeding pigeons.  aPublisher supplied data 3aColumba livia 3aalbumins 3aamino acids 3aaverage daily gain 3abeta-casein 3ablood serum 3abody weight 3abreeding 3acrude protein 3afeed intake 3alactation 3amilk 3amilk synthesis 3amortality 3apigeons 3arapamycin 3asignal transduction 3atissues 3auric acid 0arapamycin 0atarget of rapamycin 0abreeding pigeon 0ayoung squab 0acrop milk1 aFu, Z.1 aJiang, S.G.1 aWang, X.Q.1 aYan, H.C.1 aGao, C.Q.0 tPoultry science.g2020 Jan., v. 99, no. 1 p.416-422dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45501x0032-57917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps/pez5133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02850naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245016000166300001600326520135200342592002801694596001201722650001901734650001501753650001101768650001501779650001401794650002201808650001501830650001901845650001401864650002401878650001501902650000901917650002201926650001501948651001701963653003301980653002702013653003502040653002402075700001902099700001602118773014002134856008502274852000902359655001202368IND60747236320221119004247.0210812e20210703xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074723632DNAL7 a10.2989/10220119.2020.18150822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStarke, AP10aTopo-edaphic environment and forestry plantation disturbance affect the distribution of grassland forage and non-forage resources, Maputaland, South Africa  ap. 220-230.  aGrasslands are integral to rural livelihoods in southern Africa, because they provide hydrological regulation services and a variety of plant resources, including livestock fodder, medicines, and food products. To ensure ongoing provision of these resources in rapidly developing rural landscapes, an understanding of the relationships between grassland species composition and ecosystem services is required. This study examines the provision of grassland forage and non-forage resources across five grassland types in relation to environmental determinants of site topography, soil conditions, and plantation-forestry disturbance. Grasslands characteristic of low-lying and fertile landscape positions were dominated by nutritious lawn grasses and therefore tended to complement rangeland practices, whereas grasslands associated with elevated areas or infertile conditions were diverse in species composition and consequently provided the majority of plant medicines, spiritual resources, fruit-beverage resources, oils, and craft materials. Secondary grassland, resulting from forestry plantation abandonment, had moderate forage potential and limited non-forage resources. Our results provide a simple framework for approaching grassland resource classification, grassland conservation and land use management on the Maputaland coastal plain.  aPublisher supplied data  aK5/2554 3acoastal plains 3aecosystems 3aforage 3agrasslands 3ahydrology 3aland use planning 3alandscapes 3alawns and turf 3alivestock 3aplantation forestry 3arangelands 3asoil 3aspecies diversity 3atopography 3aSouth Africa 0agrassland ecosystem services 0ahygrophilous grassland 0anon-forage grassland resources 0asecondary grassland1 aO’Connor, TG1 aEverson, CS0 tAfrican journal of range & forage science.g2021 July 03, v. 38, no. 3 p.220-230dTaylor & FranciswJournal:J000000042x1727-93807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2989/10220119.2020.18150823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03436naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100001500169245013500184300001800319520136100337592002801698650002901726650001301755650002801768650002101796650001401817650001001831650001101841650002201852650001801874650000701892650001301899650004001912650005001952650002402002650002802026650002102054650001102075650004502086650002702131650002702158650003202185650003802217650002102255650002402276650004602300650001802346650003302364650001402397650003202411700002202443700002102465700001902486700002302505700002302528700001502551773009202566856008402658990002302742852000902765655001202774IND60087503220221121234614.0141102e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008750322DNAL7 a238166502pmid7 a10.1016/j.actbio.2013.06.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHild, Nora10apH-dependent antibacterial effects on oral microorganisms through pure PLGA implants and composites with nanosized bioactive glass  ap. 9118-9125.  aBiomaterials made of biodegradable poly(α-hydroxyesters) such as poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) are known to decrease the pH in the vicinity of the implants. Bioactive glass (BG) is being investigated as a counteracting agent buffering the acidic degradation products. However, in dentistry the question arises whether an antibacterial effect is rather obtained from pure PLGA or from BG/PLGA composites, as BG has been proved to be antimicrobial. In the present study the antimicrobial properties of electrospun PLGA and BG45S5/PLGA fibres were investigated using human oral bacteria (specified with mass spectrometry) incubated for up to 24h. BG45S5 nanoparticles were prepared by flame spray synthesis. The change in colony-forming units (CFU) of the bacteria was correlated with the pH of the medium during incubation. The morphology and structure of the scaffolds as well as the appearance of the bacteria were followed bymicroscopy. Additionally, we studied if the presence of BG45S5 had an influence on the degradation speed of the polymer. Finally, it turned out that the pH increase induced by the presence of BG45S5 in the scaffold did not last long enough to show a reduction in CFU. On the contrary, pure PLGA demonstrated antibacterial properties that should be taken into consideration when designing biomaterials for dental applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibacterial properties 3abacteria 3abiocompatible materials 3abiodegradability 3adentistry 3aglass 3ahumans 3amass spectrometry 3ananoparticles 3apH 3apolymers 2aAnti-Bacterial Agentsxpharmacology 2aBacteriaxdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 2aCeramicsxchemistry 2aColony Count, Microbial 2aGlassxchemistry 2aHumans 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentrationxdrug effects 2aImplants, Experimental 2aLactic Acidxchemistry 2aMicrobial Sensitivity Tests 2aMicrobial Viabilityxdrug effects 2aMolecular Weight 2aMouthxmicrobiology 2aNanoparticlesxchemistryxultrastructure. 2aParticle Size 2aPolyglycolic Acidxchemistry 2aSolutions 2aTissue Scaffoldsxchemistry1 aTawakoli, Pune N.1 aHalter, Jonas G.1 aSauer, Bärbel1 aBuchalla, Wolfgang1 aStark, Wendelin J.1 aMohn, Dirk0 tActa biomaterialia.g2013 Nov., v. 9, no. 11 p.9118-9125dElsevier Ltdx1742-70617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actbio.2013.06.0303Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03241naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245011900168300001600287520194000303592002802243650001202271650001102283650003102294650000902325650000902334650001402343650001302357650001202370650001702382650001102399650002002410650000902430653001702439653001202456653000902468653001202477653001302489700002002502700001902522700002002541700001502561773013502576856005102711852000902762655001202771IND50076242720221117204606.0140410e20120101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007624272DNAL7 a10.1080/00103624.2012.6347082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKavvadias, V.10aEffects of Soil Amended with Cadmium and Lead on Growth, Yield, and Metal Accumulation and Distribution in Parsley  ap. 161-175.  aA greenhouse experiment was designed to determine the cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb) distribution and accumulation in parsley plants grown on soil amended with Cd and Pb. The soil was amended with 0, 5, 10 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 mg Cd kg⁻¹ in the form of cadmium nitrate [Cd(NO₃)₂] and 0, 5, 10, 50 and 100 mg Pb kg⁻¹ in the form of lead nitrate [Pb(NO₃)₂]. The main soil properties; concentrations of the diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA)–extractable metals lead (Pb), Cd, copper (Cu), iron (Fe), zinc (Zn), and manganese (Mn) in soil; plant growth; and total contents of metals in shoots and roots were measured. The DTPA-extractable Cd was increased significantly by the addition of Cd. Despite the fact that Pb was not applied, its availability was significantly greater in treatments 40–100 mg Cd kg⁻¹ compared with the control. Fresh biomass was increased significantly in treatments of 5 and 10 mg Cd kg⁻¹ as compared to the control. Further addition of Cd reduced fresh weight but not significantly, although Cd concentration in shoots reached 26.5 mg kg⁻¹. Although Pb was not applied with Cd, its concentration in parsley increased significantly in treatments with 60, 80, and 100 mg Cd g⁻¹ compared with the others. Available soil Pb was increased significantly with Pb levels; nevertheless, the increase was small compared to the additions of Pb to soil. There were no significant differences in shoot and root fresh weights between treatments, although metal contents reached 20.0 mg Pb kg⁻¹ and 16.4 mg Pb kg⁻¹ respectively. Lead accumulation was enhanced by Pb treatments, but the positive effect on its uptake was not relative to the increase of Pb rates. Cadmium was not applied, and yet considerable uptake of Cd by control plants was evident. The interactive effects of Pb and Cd on their availability in soil and plants and their relation to other metals are also discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3acadmium 3acopper 3agreenhouse experimentation 3airon 3alead 3amanganese 3anitrates 3aparsley 3aplant growth 3ashoots 3asoil properties 3azinc 0aAccumulation 0acadmium 0alead 0aparsley 0atoxicity1 aPaschalidis, C.1 aVavoulidou, E.1 aPetropoulos, D.1 aKoriki, A.0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g2012 Jan. 1, v. 43, no. 1-2 p.161-175dTaylor & Francis Groupx1532-24167nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00103624.2012.634708  aDNAL 7aarticle02196naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002200125024001900147040001800166100002100184245005600205300001800261506007600279520014600355520086900501592002801370506003701398650002601435650001501461650002301476650001001499700002001509700001801529700001801547700002201565700002201587773011501609856007701724852000901801655001201810IND60172060420221207115808.0150602e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017206042DNAL7 a10.1104/pp.114.2445412doi7 aPMC42568772pmcid7 a253415342pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPéret, Benjamin10aRoot Architecture Responses: In Search of Phosphate  ap. 1713-1723.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aRoot development alters in response to phosphate availability, which affects the production of cluster roots in a limited number of species .  aSoil phosphate represents the only source of phosphorus for plants and, consequently, is its entry into the trophic chain. This major component of nucleic acids, phospholipids, and energy currency of the cell (ATP) can limit plant growth because of its low mobility in soil. As a result, root responses to low phosphate favor the exploration of the shallower part of the soil, where phosphate tends to be more abundant, a strategy described as topsoil foraging. We will review the diverse developmental strategies that can be observed among plants by detailing the effect of phosphate deficiency on primary and lateral roots. We also discuss the formation of cluster roots: an advanced adaptive strategy to cope with low phosphate availability observed in a limited number of species. Finally, we will put this work into perspective for future research directions.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3anutrient availability 3aphosphates 3aplant architecture 3aroots1 aDesnos, Thierry1 aJost, Ricarda1 aKanno, Satomi1 aBerkowitz, Oliver1 aNussaume, Laurent0 tPlant physiology.g2014 Dec., v. 166, no. 4 p.1713-1723dAmerican Society of Plant Biologistsx0032-08897nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1104/pp.114.2445413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02493naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006300148245012800211300001800339500001900357520133400376592002801710650001401738650001301752650001501765700005901780700005801839700005901897773014401956856008202100852000902182655001202191IND60711454420221121022258.0200928e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071145442DNAL7 a10.1007/s12524-020-01168-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKulshrestha, Akriti1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8132-793110aResolving Biases in DEM Differencing for Estimation of Change in Elevation of Glacier Surfaces Using Cartosat-I Stereo Data  ap. 1443-1453.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aUnderstanding the impact of climatic variations on Himalayan-Karakoram glaciers has now become a necessity for planning water resources of Indus-Ganga–Brahmaputra basins. One of the most important parameters to assess this is the mass balance of glaciers. Besides ground-based studies of mass balance, differencing of Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) is now commonly employed for estimating the long-term changes for this purpose. Before applying this approach, it is necessary to evaluate the accuracy of elevation changes of glacier surfaces with respect to terrain parameters and the DEMs used. This study demonstrates the factors governing DEM differencing using an example of four glaciers of Zanskar region by comparing DEMs extracted from Cartosat-1 stereo data of ablation season of the years 2005 and 2015. A strong relation has been observed between slope of the terrain and elevation changes between the two DEMs on non-glaciated stable terrain (R² = 0.8144). The regression equation thus developed has been used to correct elevation changes on glacier surface. Lowering of ablation zone of the four sample glaciers over a period of ten years has been of the order of 3.92, 11.17, 4.99 and 4.39 m. The results obtained by using Cartosat-I DEMs have also been validated using ASTER DEMs of similar time interval.  aPublisher supplied data 3aequations 3aglaciers 3alandscapes1 aBahuguna, I.

The scarce information about purple corn cob (PCC) is encouraging an interest in exploring its potential as a valuable source of bioactive compounds with benefits for human health. In this study, a green method based on hydrothermal processing was used for the simultaneous extraction of oligosaccharides and phenolic compounds from PCC. For this purpose, the effects of three factors (time, temperature and pH) on the oligosaccharide content (OSC), total phenolic content (TPC), total flavonoid content (TFC), total anthocyanin content (TAC), as well as on the antioxidant activity measured with three different methods (DPPH, ABTS and FRAP) were evaluated. The bioactive extract obtained under optimal conditions presented a high content of bioactive compounds exhibiting a notable antioxidant capacity and moderate inhibitory activities towards xanthine oxidase. This extract was also structurally characterized by FTIR, HPAEC-DAD, MALDI-TOF-MS and TGA, and the HPLC-ESI-MS analysis led to the tentative identification of 15 antioxidant phenolic compounds. Thus, this research demonstrated that this residue from the food industry has a high potential for obtaining several bioactive compounds that can be utilized as multi-functional ingredients in the food and pharmaceutical industries.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aZea mays 3aanthocyanins 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3abeverages 3abioactive compounds 3abiorefining 3acorn 3acorn cobs 3adesserts 3afood industry 3ahot water treatment 3ahuman health 3aingredients 3amatrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization mass spectrometry 3aoligosaccharides 3apH 3apharmaceutical industry 3atemperature 3athermogravimetry 3axanthine oxidase 0aPurple corn cob 0aOligosaccharides 0aAnthocyanins 0aAntioxidant phenolics 0aHydrothermal treatment1 aEibes, Gemma1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2432-63231 aLorenzo, José M.,1 aPérez-Rodríguez, Noelia1 aLú-Chau, Thelmo A.1 aGullón, Beatriz0 tScience of the total environment.g2020 Mar. 20, v. 709 p.136236-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.1362363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03767naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100005600140245015600196500002000352520233400372592002802706596004302734596006802777650001602845650001202861650001502873650001402888650002702902650001902929650001202948650001602960651001002976700002402986700006003010700001903070700006103089773013503150856007503285852000903360655001203369IND60786022420221119013838.0220802e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078602242DNAL7 a10.1111/jfpe.140672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBhati, Dolly1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4362-847710aEngineering, biochemical, and cooking characteristics of seven eminent cultivars of brown rice: Implication on development of food processing equipment  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe objective of the present investigation was to substantiate the versatility of brown rice obtained from distinguished Indian varieties with a viable hyphenation with the cultivar influences. Brown rice from seven eminent cultivars, that is, PR‐114, PR‐121, PR‐122, PR‐123, PR‐124, PR‐126, and PR‐127, was in depth characterized by a broad spectrum of properties. Primarily, to comprehend the suggestive milling behavior of paddy and brown rice, their dimensional and physical properties were compared. Secondly, to validate the physicofunctional and cooking prominence of the grain, properties such as amylose and amylopectin content, alkali spreading value (ASV), temperature, and behavior of gelatinization were scrutinized. The assessment of specific nutritional components viz., mineral, vitamins, and fatty acid composition together with textural profile analysis of the cooked grain further validated the primacy of the Indian cultivars. The result presented that the physical and dimensional characteristics of paddy and brown rice varied significantly. In terms of physicochemical and cooking properties, the cultivars PR‐122 and PR‐124 demonstrated considerable pre‐eminence. Furthermore, the ASV, temperature, and gelatinization behavior were principally associated with the starch constituents, that is, amylose and amylopectin. With reference to the mineral, vitamins, and fatty acid composition of the cultivars, PR‐122, PR‐122, and PR‐124 were nutritionally and functionally viable and diverse. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Brown rice is a nutritionally and biofunctionally eminent cereal grain. A viable hyphenation between the anticipated properties demonstrated by these improved and high‐yielding brown rice varieties grown in India would further endorse the cultivation of these cultivars at a larger scale as well as invigorated the farmers to fast‐track their cultivation estate. The physical, physicochemical, gelatinization, cooking, and textural properties of the Indian brown rice cultivars could play a vital role in deciphering and substantiating its processing, nutritional and bio‐viable eminences, which would further confirm their superior demands in the context of regional and national food markets along with food processing industries operating at variable scales.  aPublisher supplied data  cMinistry of Human Resource Development  cthe Ministry of Human Resource Development, Government of India 3aamylopectin 3aamylose 3abrown rice 3acultivars 3afatty acid composition 3agelatinization 3apaddies 3atemperature 3aIndia1 aBalajīta Siṅgha,1 aSingh, Arashdeep1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1554-05121 aSharma, Savita1 aPandiselvam, Ravi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0996-83280 tJournal of food process engineering.g2022 Aug., v. 45, no. 8 p.e14067-dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl8651x0145-88767nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfpe.140673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02906naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245019400174520137900368592002801747650002301775650001401798650001901812650002601831650001801857650001401875650002001889650002601909650001901935650002901954650002001983650001702003650001602020650002002036650002602056650001002082650001402092653001402106653001402120653000802134653001402142653001602156700003002172700002602202773009002228856008502318852000902403655001202412IND60730093320221119064653.0220103e20210615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073009332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2021.1202182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJatoth, Ramachander10aExperimental study of using biodiesel and low cetane alcohol as the pilot fuel on the performance and emission trade-off study in the diesel/compressed natural gas dual fuel combustion mode  aIncreasing demand for fast depleting diesel in various transport applications with a rise in vehicular exhaust emissions led many countries to research on alternative economic fuels. This paper deals with the study of compressed natural gas (CNG) and Schleicher oleosa oil methyl ester (SOME) with diesel as pilot fuel and triacetin as an additive on the emission, combustion and performance characteristics of a four stroke, single cylinder, common rail direct injection diesel engine working at a constant speed and varying operating scenarios. Majority of the input energy is provided by CNG when triacetin is used in pilot operation rather than diesel. The experimental study revealed that, as compared to traditional CNG + diesel (dual fuel), CNG + triacetin combination the number of harmful pollutants like smoke (5.38%), hydrocarbon (6.39%), carbon monoxide (10.24%) and oxides of nitrogen, has reduced to a considerable extent and there was a commendable improvement in the brake thermal efficiency by 8.8%. A trade-off study conducted concludes that the low emission high-performance paradox can be resolved through the dual-fuel operation with CNG + triacetin blend. So, we can summarize that when CNG and triacetin additives are blended together the combustion and performance of the engine was improved considerably and pollutant emissions were decreased.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSchleichera oleosa 3aadditives 3aair pollutants 3aair pollution control 3aalcohol fuels 3abiodiesel 3acarbon monoxide 3acombustion efficiency 3adiesel engines 3afatty acid methyl esters 3afuel combustion 3ahydrocarbons 3anatural gas 3anitrogen oxides 3aparticulate emissions 3asmoke 3atriacetin 0aAdditives 0aBiodiesel 0aCNG 0aTriacetin 0aCRDI engine1 aGugulothu, Santhosh Kumar1 aRavi kiran Sastry, G.0 tEnergy.g2021 June 15, v. 225 p.120218-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2021.1202183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02282naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002100143245003800164520134100202592002801543650002501571650001701596650001401613650001101627650001101638650000901649650001001658650001301668700001901681700001801700700002101718773011901739856007701858852000901935655001201944IND60729278120221117223236.0210228e20210204xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072927812DNAL7 a10.3390/genes120202262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartina, Matteo 14aThe Genetic Basis of Tomato Aroma  aTomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) aroma is determined by the interaction of volatile compounds (VOCs) released by the tomato fruits with receptors in the nose, leading to a sensorial impression, such as “sweet”, “smoky”, or “fruity” aroma. Of the more than 400 VOCs released by tomato fruits, 21 have been reported as main contributors to the perceived tomato aroma. These VOCs can be grouped in five clusters, according to their biosynthetic origins. In the last decades, a vast array of scientific studies has investigated the genetic component of tomato aroma in modern tomato cultivars and their relatives. In this paper we aim to collect, compare, integrate and summarize the available literature on flavour-related QTLs in tomato. Three hundred and fifty nine (359) QTLs associated with tomato fruit VOCs were physically mapped on the genome and investigated for the presence of potential candidate genes. This review makes it possible to (i) pinpoint potential donors described in literature for specific traits, (ii) highlight important QTL regions by combining information from different populations, and (iii) pinpoint potential candidate genes. This overview aims to be a valuable resource for researchers aiming to elucidate the genetics underlying tomato flavour and for breeders who aim to improve tomato aroma.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSolanum lycopersicum 3abiosynthesis 3acultivars 3aflavor 3afruits 3anose 3aodors 3atomatoes1 aTikunov, Yury 1 aPortis, Ezio 1 aBovy, Arnaud  G.0 tGenes.g2021 Feb. 04, v. 12, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27140x2073-44257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/genes120202263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03243naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245011700168300001600285520169300301592002801994596008302022650003802105650002102143650002202164650001102186650001902197650001802216650001602234650001002250650000902260650001902269650001302288650003702301650002502338650001402363650001402377650002602391650002602417650001702443650001702460651002102477700006002498773011202558856008202670852000902752655001202761IND60711454720221121001933.0200928e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071145472DNAL7 a10.1007/s12600-020-00828-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHusseini, Ahmad14aThe possible mechanisms of copper resistance in the pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pathovars in stone fruit trees  ap. 705-718.  aOne of the most common diseases affecting Stone-fruits is Bacterial Canker, caused by Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae (Pss) and morsprunorum (Psm). In this study, Pss and Psm were isolated from stone-fruit trees from the Western Aegean region (WA) and Lake Van Basin (LVB) of Turkey, where pesticide usage is high and low, respectively. We aimed to determine copper resistance levels, the involved resistance mechanisms and the reactions to copper pesticides of these isolates. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and lethal dose 50 (LD₅₀) of the isolates were detected using CuSO₄ and other Cu-pesticides. To determine the mechanisms of copper resistance, the presence of copA and cusA genes was investigated. The modified Fe/Cu Blue-CAS Agar media were used to investigate the relationship between the isolates’ copper resistance and each isolate’s ability to produce siderophores. The highest MIC value was 2 mM in CuSO4. The tolerance levels of the isolates from the WA and LVB regions were 29% and 47% susceptible, 29% and 47% low resistance and 42% and 6% resistant, respectively. The most successful pesticide was (CuSO4 + Ca (OH)2) + mancozeb. While none of the isolates had the cusA gene, four isolates had the copA gene, which was proven to be plasmid-borne. Differences between copA gene sequences were detected and were determined to be not related to the pathovars. The amount of siderophore produced against copper in Ps pathovars affected seems to be related with the resistance level. Also, Ps pathovars were able to tolerate copper at doses as high as 1.1 mM by producing siderophores, and at doses of 1.7 mM and above through the copA gene.  aPublisher supplied data  aFAP-2018-7627cScientific Research Project Units of Van Yuzuncu Yil University 3aPseudomonas syringae pv. syringae 3abacterial canker 3acalcium hydroxide 3acopper 3acopper sulfate 3aculture media 3afruit trees 3agenes 3airon 3alethal dose 50 3amancozeb 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3anucleotide sequences 3apathogens 3apathovars 3apesticide application 3aresistance mechanisms 3asiderophores 3astone fruits 3aTurkey (country)1 aAkköprü, Ahmet1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7908-88310 tPhytoparasitica.g2020 Nov., v. 48, no. 5 p.705-718dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl9750x0334-21237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12600-020-00828-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02203naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001800145245009400163500001900257520106300276592002801339650001501367650001301382650001901395650001701414650001801431650001301449650001901462650001801481650001701499700001901516700001801535700001701553700002001570700001801590773012101608856007901729852000901808655001201817IND60735084320221122005457.0210423e20210401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073508432DNAL7 a10.3390/biology100402852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Gi  Beom10aMesenchymal Stem Cell-Derived Exosomes and Their Therapeutic Potential for Osteoarthritis  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aExosomes are nano-sized vesicles (50–150 nm in diameter) that contain nucleic acids (e.g., microRNA and messenger RNA), functional proteins, and bioactive lipids. They are secreted by various types of cells, including B cells, T cells, reticulocytes, dendritic cells, mast cells, epithelial cells, and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). They perform a wide variety of functions, including the repair of damaged tissues, regulation of immune responses, and reduction in inflammation. When considering the limitations of MSCs, including issues in standardization and immunogenicity, MSC-derived exosomes have advantages such as small dimensions, low immunogenicity, and lack of requirement for additional procedures for culture expansion or delivery. MSC-derived exosomes have shown outstanding therapeutic effects through chondro-protective and anti-inflammatory properties. MSC-derived exosomes may enable a new therapeutic paradigm for the treatment of osteoarthritis. However, further research is needed to prove their clinical effectiveness and feasibility.  aPublisher supplied data 3aepithelium 3aexosomes 3aimmunogenicity 3ainflammation 3amessenger RNA 3amicroRNA 3aosteoarthritis 3areticulocytes 3atherapeutics1 aShon, Oog-Jin 1 aSeo, Min-Soo 1 aChoi, Young 1 aPark, Wook  Tae1 aLee, Gun  Woo0 tBiology.g2021 Apr. 01, v. 10, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21557x2079-77377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/biology100402853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03266naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006100151245010400212506010400316506007600420520178900496592002802285506003702313650001002350650001102360650001902371650003002390650001702420650001202437650001902449650001902468650001502487651001102502651001002513653002002523653002902543653001202572653001802584653001102602700001902613773009302632856008602725852000902811655001202820IND60783893720221207052430.0220914e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078389372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e100052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhawaldah, Hamzah1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6851-752210aSocio-economic and environmental impacts of Syrian Refugees in Jordan: A Jordanians’ perspective  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aJordan has received more than 1.2 million Syrian refugees, including 656,213 registered with United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) since the beginning of Syrian crisis in 2011. Jordanians are acutely feeling significant impacts of the refugees on their daily lives and refugees' pressure on services, natural resources and the labor market, especially in host communities where the impact is the highest. This study aims to analyze economic, social and environmental impacts of Syrian refugees in Jordan from Jordanians' point of view. It also aims to identify the suggestions of Jordanians to alleviate the impacts of Syrians and adapt with the refugees issue in Jordan. This study relies primarily on the available data of Syrian refugees taken from the relevant corporations in Jordan such as Department of Statistics, Ministry of Planning and International Cooperation (MOPIC), and UNHCR. In addition, a questionnaire was designed and distributed online to a representative sample of Jordanians (1080 respondents) to achieve the study’s objectives. The results revealed that pressure on labor market, services, and infrastructure as well as increasing housing rents were the main economic impacts of Syrian refugees especially in the neighboring governorates of Syria in Jordan. The social impacts were represented by increasing crime rates and drugs. Refugees also have impacts and pressure on clean water, energy and environment. However, the respondents reported some positive impacts of refugees including providing market with highly-skilled and low-waged labors that makes the Jordanian market more competitive. The study concluded with some suggested recommendations that may alleviate the negative impacts of refugees on Jordan and adapt with the crisis.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acrime 3aenergy 3ainfrastructure 3ainternational cooperation 3alabor market 3amarkets 3aquestionnaires 3asocioeconomics 3astatistics 3aJordan 3aSyria 0aSyrian refugees 0aJordanians’ perception 0aImpacts 0aSyrian crisis 0aJordan1 aAlzboun, Nidal0 tHeliyon.g2022 Aug., v. 8, no. 8 p.e10005-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e100053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02950naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245014100169300001400310520149100324592002801815650001301843650001401856650001201870650001601882650001601898650002301914650001701937650002101954650001101975650002501986653001502011653001602026653002502042653002102067653001802088653001302106700002402119700002702143700007002170773017002240856008502410852000902495655001202504IND60568144120221120125508.0180904e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056814412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jbiosc.2017.02.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuong, Kai-Hee10aPilot scale production of poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-4-hydroxybutyrate) biopolymers with high molecular weight and elastomeric properties  ap. 76-83.  aPoly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-4-hydroxybutyrate) [(P(3HB-co-4HB)] copolymer receives attention as next generation biomaterial in medical application. However, the exploitation of the copolymer is still constrained since such copolymer has not yet successfully been performed in industrial scale production. In this work, we intended to establish pilot production system of the copolymer retaining the copolymer quality which has recently discovered to have novel characteristic from lab scale fermentation. An increase of agitation speed has significantly improved the copolymer accumulation efficiency by minimizing the utilization of substrates towards cell growth components. This is evidenced by a drastic increase of PHA content from 28 wt% to 63 wt% and PHA concentration from 3.1 g/L to 6.5 g/L but accompanied by the reduction of residual biomass from 8.0 g/L to 3.8 g/L. Besides, fermentations at lower agitation and aeration have resulted in reduced molecular weight and mechanical strength of the copolymer, suggesting the role of sufficient oxygen supply efficiency in improving the properties of the resulting copolymers. The KLa-based scale-up fermentation was performed successfully in maintaining the yield and the quality of the copolymers produced without a drastic fluctuation. This suggests that the scale-up based on the KLa values supported the fermentation system of P(3HB-co-4HB) copolymer production in single-stage using mixed-substrate cultivation strategy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaeration 3aagitation 3abiomass 3abiopolymers 3acell growth 3acomposite polymers 3afermentation 3amolecular weight 3aoxygen 3astrength (mechanics) 0aBiopolymer 0aBioreactors 0aPolyhydroxyalkanoate 0aPilot production 0aP(3HB-co-4HB) 0aScale-up1 aAzuraini, Mat Junoh1 aAziz, Nursolehah Abdul1 aAmirul, Al-Ashraf Abdullah1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5014-14720 tJournal of bioscience and bioengineering.g2017 July, v. 124, no. 1 p.76-83dElsevier B.V.aThe Society for Biotechnology, JapanwJournal:jnl3929975x1389-17237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiosc.2017.02.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02274naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006000151245010300211506011700314506007600431520096000507592002801467506003701495650001201532650001601544650001201560650001301572651001301585653002201598653002801620653003001648653002701678653001901705773009301724856008601817852000901903655001201912IND60783893820221207052613.0221004e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078389382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e100062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHabtamu Wondimu,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3507-604010aGender-based violence and its socio-cultural implications in South West Ethiopia secondary schools  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe present study aimed to examine the determinant factors of school-related gender-based violence and its socio-cultural implications for female academic fulfillment in Wolkite town secondary schools. In terms of the research approach, sequential mixed explanatory methods were used. This study took Wolkite secondary schools students and respondents (n = 215). The study results have shown that the most significant socio-cultural determinant factors for school-related gender-based violence resulted from a lack of societal motives to address the problem and gender discriminatory norms bitterly blamed. From this finding, the researcher concluded that the sociocultural practices of the patriarchal ideology that society entertains have a tremendous impact on female students being victimized by gender-based violence and their educational attainment. Policymakers should therefore have significant involvement in school-related gender-based violence.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3afemales 3aresearchers 3asociety 3aviolence 3aEthiopia 0aSexual harassment 0aEducational fulfilments 0aSocio-cultural influences 0aViolence against women 0aSexual assault0 tHeliyon.g2022 July, v. 8, no. 7 p.e10006-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e100063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02833naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002200112245014400134300001600278520160400294592002801898650001901926650001701945650001201962650001001974650001301984650002801997650001402025650001002039650000902049651001502058653001502073653001902088653001902107653001902126653002502145653003202170700002502202700002502227700002702252773012302279852000902402655001202411IND60126601320221122085322.0151124e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012660132DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJoseph, Shimat V.10aEvidence of Protaphorura fimata (Collembola: Poduromorpha: Onychiuridae) Feeding on Germinating Lettuce in the Salinas Valley of California  ap. 228-236.  aA series of experiments were conducted to determine the impact of Protaphorura fimata Gisin (Family: Onychiuridae) feeding on seeds and germinating seedlings of lettuce, Lactuca sativa L. (Asteraceae). First, various densities of P. fimata were incubated with 25 lettuce seeds for 7 d and feeding injury was evaluated in three soilless arena experiments. As a second step, 100 P. fimata were incubated with 25 lettuce seeds in three arena experiments with soil media. Finally, in a commercial field the incidence and impact of P. fimata on recently planted lettuce was assessed following applications of pyrethroid—insecticides: 2 d before planting, at planting, and 20 d later. In experiments without soil, the number of ungerminated seeds, feeding injury sites, and plants with injury were significantly greater in arenas with P. fimata than without. Similarly, the number of germinated seedlings, shoot fresh, and dry weights, and the length and width of fully opened-leaves were greater in arenas without than with P. fimata in assays with soil. In the field, P. fimata densities were significantly lower in beds that received insecticides at 2 d before and at planting than in untreated beds. Also, the fresh and dry weights of lettuce plants were significantly greater in the beds that received insecticide than in untreated. The results clearly show that P. fimata is a pest of lettuce and can cause severe feeding injury to germinating seeds or seedlings, thereby reducing their growth rate. The potential implications of P. fimata feeding and feeding injury characteristics are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLactuca sativa 3aOnychiuridae 3alettuce 3apests 3aplanting 3apyrethroid insecticides 3aseedlings 3aseeds 3asoil 3aCalifornia 0aspringtail 0afeeding injury 0aseed predation 0aLactuca sativa 0avegetable production 0acentral coast of California1 aBettiga, Christopher1 aRamírez, Christian,1 aSoto-Adames, Felipe N.0 tJournal of economic entomology.g2015 Feb., v. 108, no. 1 p.228-236dEntomological Society of Americax0022-04937nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02880naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002700151245012600178300001600304520132100320592002801641650002301669650002501692650002701717650001501744650002301759650000901782650002801791650002601819650001301845650001101858650001301869653001801882653002001900653002601920700003101946700003201977700003802009700003002047700003902077700002702116700003302143773013902176856008602315852000902401655001202410IND60788523820221116143031.0220815e20220803xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078852382DNAL7 a10.1080/03601234.2022.20935902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRubio-Tinajero, Sarahi10aIn vitro biocontrol of Fusarium oxysporum with antagonistic microorganisms and In vivo effect on Solanum lycopersicum L.  ap. 625-635.  aThe objective was to evaluate the effects of In vitro biocontrol of Trichoderma spp. and Bacillus spp. against Fusarium oxysporum and its in vivo effect on Solanum lycopersicum plants.

This lethal disease has decimated native redbay [Persea borbonia (L.) Sprengel] and swampbay [Persea palustris (Rafinesque) Sargent] throughout southeastern U.S. forests, and currently threatens avocado (Persea americana Miller) in Florida. To curtail the spread of laurel wilt, effective attractants are needed for early detection of the vector. Phoebe oil lures were the best known attractant for X. glabratus, but they are no longer available. The current detection system uses manuka oil lures, but previous research indicated that manuka lures have a short field life in Florida. Recently, cubeb oil was identified as a new attractant for X. glabratus, and cubeb bubble lures are now available commercially. This study compared trapping efficacy and field longevity of cubeb and manuka lures with phoebe lures that had been in storage since 2010 over a 12-wk period in south Florida. In addition, terpenoid emissions were quantified from cubeb and manuka lures aged outdoors for 12 wk. Captures were comparable with all three lures for 3 wk, but by 4 wk, captures with manuka were significantly less. Equivalent captures were obtained with cubeb and phoebe lures for 7 wk, but captures with cubeb were significantly greater from 8 to 12 wk. Our results indicate that cubeb bubble lures are the most effective tool currently available for detection of X. glabratus, with a field life of 3 months due to extended low release of attractive sesquiterpenes, primarily α-copaene and α-cubebene.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCurculionidae 3aPersea americana 3aPersea borbonia 3aPhoebe 3aRaffaelea 3aXyleborus glabratus 3aattractants 3aavocados 3aemissions 3aforests 3afungi 3alongevity 3aoils 3asesquiterpenoids 3atrapping 3awood 3aFlorida 0aXyleborus glabratus 0alaurel wilt 0amanuka oil 0aα-copaene 0aα-cubebene1 aNiogret, Jerome1 aMontgomery, Wayne S.1 aDeyrup, Mark A.1 aEpsky, Nancy D.0 tJournal of economic entomology.g2015 Feb., v. 108, no. 1 p.350-361dEntomological Society of Americax0022-04937nnas  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle03931naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002600150245015800176300001400334520208800348592002802436650003002464650002102494650002602515650003102541650001802572650001602590650002602606650000902632650002002641650001702661650000902678650001702687650003702704650001502741650001402756650001402770650001502784650003102799650001702830650002402847651001102871653003202882653001502914653004402929653002202973700001902995700001803014700002003032700001803052700002003070700001803090700001903108773010803127856008503235852000903320655001203329IND60526266920221120192846.0190403e20160815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052626692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetmic.2016.05.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorrissey, I.q(Ian),10aAntimicrobial susceptibility monitoring of bacterial pathogens isolated from respiratory tract infections in dogs and cats across Europe: ComPath results  ap. 44-51.  aComPath is a pan-European resistance monitoring programme collecting bacterial pathogens from dogs and cats. We present data for respiratory tract infection (RTI) isolates collected between 2008 and 2010. Antimicrobial minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined and susceptibility calculated following Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) standards for veterinary medicine. The main pathogen from dogs was Staphylococcus intermedius Group (49/215, 22.8%) which was >90% susceptible to most antimicrobials (including oxacillin − 93.9%; 3 isolates confirmed mecA-positive) but only 59.2%, 73.5% and 87.8% susceptible to tetracycline, chloramphenicol and penicillin. Bordetella bronchiseptica (48/215, 22.3%), streptococci (36/215, 16.7%), Escherichia coli (24/215, 11.2%) and Pasteurella multocida (23/215, 10.7%) were also found in dog RTI. There are no breakpoints for Bordetella bronchiseptica. Most streptococci were penicillin- chloramphenicol-, ampicillin- and pradofloxacin-susceptible. None were enrofloxacin-resistant but 6 isolates (16.7%) were of intermediate susceptibility. The least active agent against streptococci was tetracycline (47.2% susceptible). For E. coli, 37.5% were ampicillin-susceptible but 83.3% were amoxicillin/clavulanic acid-susceptible. Only chloramphenicol showed susceptibility>90% against E. coli, with 66.7% tetracycline-susceptible and 79.2% to 87.5% susceptibility to enrofloxacin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or pradofloxacin. P. multocida were susceptible to pradofloxacin (no other breakpoints are available). The main pathogen from cats was P. multocida (82/186, 44.1%), where only pradofloxacin has breakpoints (100% susceptible). Streptococci were also collected from cats (25/186, 13.4%) and were >90% susceptible to all antimicrobials except tetracycline (36% susceptible). Most susceptibility was calculated with human-derived breakpoints and some antimicrobials had no breakpoints. Therefore predictions of clinical utility for dog and cat RTI will remain problematical unless specific breakpoints are set.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBordetella bronchiseptica 3aEscherichia coli 3aPasteurella multocida 3aStaphylococcus intermedius 3aStreptococcus 3aamoxicillin 3aantibiotic resistance 3acats 3achloramphenicol 3adog diseases 3adogs 3aenrofloxacin 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3amonitoring 3aoxacillin 3apathogens 3aprediction 3arespiratory tract diseases 3atetracycline 3aveterinary medicine 3aEurope 0aRespiratory tract infection 0aResistance 0aAntimicrobial susceptibility monitoring 0aCompanion animals1 aMoyaert, Hilde1 ade Jong, Anno1 aEl Garch, Farid1 aKlein, Ulrich1 aLudwig, Carolin1 aThiry, Julien1 aYouala, Myriam0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2016 Aug. 15, v. 191 p.44-51dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8205x0378-11357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2016.05.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03387naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100006200153245007600215520179900291592002802090650001602118650001102134650001202145650001902157650001202176650002202188650001102210650001302221650001502234650000902249650000902258650001402267650001502281650000902296650001402305650001002319650001202329651002102341700001702362700005802379700006102437700006002498700002602558700002202584700002402606700002302630773011902653856008802772852000902860655001202869IND60679609520221120230041.0200503e20200410xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067960952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.1362482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSnoeck, Christophe1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3770-405510aTowards a biologically available strontium isotope baseline for Ireland  aStrontium isotopes are used in archaeology, ecology, forensics, and other disciplines to study the origin of artefacts, humans, animals and food items. Strontium in animal and human tissues such as bone and teeth originates from food and drink consumed during life, leaving an isotopic signal corresponding to their geographical origin (i.e. where the plants grew, the animals grazed and the drinking water passed through). To contextualise the measurements obtained directly on animal and human remains, it is necessary to have a sound baseline of the isotopic variation of biologically available strontium in the landscape. In general, plants represent the main source of strontium for humans and animals as they usually contain much higher strontium concentrations than animal products (meat and milk) or drinking water. The observed difference between the strontium isotope composition of geological bedrock, soils and plants from the same locality warrants direct measurement of plants to create a reliable baseline. Here we present the first baseline of the biologically available strontium isotope composition for the island of Ireland based on 228 measurements on plants from 140 distinct locations. The isoscape shows significant variation in strontium isotope composition between different areas of Ireland with values as low as 0.7067 for the basalt outcrops in County Antrim and values of up to 0.7164 in the Mourne Mountains. This variability confirms the potential for studying mobility and landscape use of past human and animal populations in Ireland. Furthermore, in some cases, large differences were observed between different types of plants from the same location, highlighting the need to measure more than one plant sample per location for the creation of BASr baselines.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarchaeology 3abasalt 3abedrock 3adrinking water 3aecology 3aforensic sciences 3ahumans 3aisotopes 3alandscapes 3ameat 3amilk 3amountains 3aprovenance 3asoil 3astrontium 3ateeth 3atissues 3aNorthern Ireland1 aRyan, Saskia1 aPouncett, John1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8387-44991 aPellegrini, Maura1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8473-55861 aClaeys, Philippe1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4585-76871 aWainwright, Ashlea N.1 aMattielli, Nadine1 aLee-Thorp, Julia A.1 aSchulting, Rick J.0 tScience of the total environment.g2020 Apr. 10, v. 712 p.136248-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.1362483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02795naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245012300171300001600294520126700310592002801577650002101605650001601626650001401642650001601656650001301672650000901685650002601694650001001720650002801730650002001758650002201778650001001800650002101810650001401831650002401845650002501869650000901894653002201903653001701925653002601942653001801968653002901986653001502015700002502030773013902055856008602194852000902280655001202289IND60788524020221116143115.0220815e20220803xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078852402DNAL7 a10.1080/03601234.2022.20969882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZara, Enrico S.10aPhylogroup typing and carbapenem resistance of Escherichia coli from agricultural samples in Metro Manila, Philippines  ap. 644-656.  aPrimary production environment is considered as reservoir of Escherichia coli contamination of produce. E. coli is classified into eight phylogroups which differ in ecological niches, evolutionary history, and phenotypic properties. To understand the population genetic structure and composition of E. coli in primary production environments in Metro Manila, Philippines, a total of 80 E. coli recovered from irrigation water, soil, vegetables, and feces of cat, carabao, chicken, dog, and goat were allocated into distinct phylogroups based on the presence and absence of genetic markers. Results showed that the most prevalent phylogroup was B1 (71.3%), followed by A (18.6%), D (6.3%), B2 (1.3%), E (1.3%), and an unknown phylogroup (1.3%). The most prevalent genetic marker was arpA, followed by TspE4.C2, yjaA, and chuA. The carbapenem resistance of 24 E. coli isolates representing different phylogroups was also evaluated. Intriguingly, all isolates exhibited uniform susceptibility. This is the first report to provide insights into the phylogroup structure and composition, as well as carbapenem resistance of E. coli from primary production in the Philippines, which highlights possible source of and solution for gastrointestinal and enteric diseases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aPhilippines 3abuffaloes 3acarbapenems 3achickens 3adogs 3aenvironmental science 3afeces 3agastrointestinal system 3agenetic markers 3agenetic structure 3agoats 3airrigation water 3aphenotype 3apopulation genetics 3aprimary productivity 3asoil 0aagricultural soil 0aanimal feces 0acarbapenem resistance 0afresh produce 0agastrointestinal disease 0aphylogroup1 aVital, Pierangeli G.0 tJournal of environmental science and health.g2022 Aug. 3, v. 57, no. 8 p.644-656dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl11541x1532-41097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03601234.2022.20969883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02928naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245010400164300001800268520183700286592002802123650002602151650002702177650001002204650002302214650001302237650001402250650001502264650003502279650001302314650001002327650001702337650001302354700002302367773010702390856004802497852000902545655001202554IND4468225620221120124121.0120727e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446822562DNAL7 a10.1007/s10531-011-0139-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDaniels, G.

There have been very few studies of the attitudes of exurban landowners to nature, all of which indicate a high degree of biophilia, and no studies of the effect of variation in the attitudes and actions of these landowners on wild mammal assemblages on their properties. A questionnaire survey of landowners was combined with spotlight observations of fauna on their properties to test the attitudes of the landowners to nature and the null hypothesis that syndromes of landowner attitudes to nature, and actions in relation to nature, have no effect on wild mammals at the property scale. All respondents were positive about native wild animals and trees. Four groups of landowners (biophiles, autocrats, idealists and utilitarians) derived by a classification of ordination scores based on attitude and action question responses, were different in their attitudes towards native wild mammals, exotic wild mammals and trees. However, their properties did not differ in the presence or frequency of any native wild mammal species. There were statistical relationships between the presence/absence of native wild animal species and indices related to intervention, fondness of trees, aversion to trees, fondness of native animals, and fondness of exotic animals. However, with the possible exception of the tendency of the common brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula) to be absent from properties owned by the people who least liked wild animals, the association of native animals with attitude or action indices appeared to be coincidental. It therefore seems that programs directed towards influencing the attitudes of landowners to wildlife may be ineffective in conserving wildlife in exurbia.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTrichosurus vulpecula 3aattitudes and opinions 3afauna 3aindigenous species 3aland use 3alandforms 3alandowners 3anatural resources conservation 3aopossums 3atrees 3awild animals 3awildlife1 aKirkpatrick, J.

Analysis of genes that are expressed during these interactions represents a powerful strategy to obtain insights into the molecular events underlying these changes. Clubroot of canola (Brassica napus), caused by the obligate parasite Plasmodiophora brassicae, has considerable economic impact but has not been characterized extensively at the molecular genetic level. Here we have used suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) and expressed sequence tag (EST) analysis to investigate gene expression during the early stages of colonization of canola roots by P. brassicae. A cDNA library was constructed by SSH which consisted of 797 clones that represented 439 unigenes. Thirty-two of these genes were demonstrated to be of a P. brassicae origin, and of these, 24 had not been previously reported. The remaining 407 genes, which were of a canola origin, were subjected to gene ontology and in silico analyses. Real-time PCR analysis of ten P. brassicae and seven canola genes indicated that seven of the former and five of the latter were upregulated at 7 days after infection, suggesting the importance of these genes in pathogenesis or host resistance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrassica napus 3aPlasmodiophora brassicae 3acDNA libraries 3acanola 3aclones 3acomplementary DNA 3aeconomic impact 3aexpressed sequence tags 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3ahost-parasite relationships 3amicroorganisms 3aparasites 3apathogenesis 3aphysiology 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aroots 3asuppression subtractive hybridization 3aunigenes 0acDNA library 0aclubroot 0aexpressed sequence tags 0asuppression subtractive hybridization1 aHwang, Sheau-Fang1 aStrelkov, Stephen E.0 tCanadian journal of plant pathology.g2012 Oct. 1, v. 34, no. 4 p.562-574dTaylor & Francisx1715-29927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07060661.2012.722128  aDNAL 7aarticle02807naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245014900171300001400320520130300334592002801637650002201665650001201687650002501699650001201724650003401736650001501770650001701785650002501802651001101827653003301838653000801871653000901879653002001888653001301908700006501921700001701986700001902003700002202022700001802044700002202062700002302084700001502107773010902122856008502231852000902316655001202325IND60568144820221123002513.0190411e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056814482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.forpol.2017.04.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKraxner, Florian10aMapping certified forests for sustainable management - A global tool for information improvement through participatory and collaborative mapping  ap. 10-18.  aThere are currently no spatially explicit, openly accessible data available on forest certification below national level, so understanding the drivers of certification in the past, examining the scope for further certification and using this information for development of future sustainable forest management strategies is challenging. Hence, this paper presents a methodology for the development of a global map of certified forest areas at 1km resolution in order to satisfy this information need. Validation of the map with certified areas in Russia showed reasonable results, but the lack of openly accessible data requires broadening the strategy for improving the global certification map in the future. Thus, the second aim of the paper is to present an online tool for visualization and interactive improvement of the global forest certification product through collaborative mapping, aiming at a range of stakeholders including third-party certifiers, green NGOs, forestry organizations, decision-makers, scientists and local experts. Such an approach can help to make more accurate information on forest certification available, promote the sharing of data and encourage more transparent and sustainable forest management, i.e. both producers and users can benefit from this online tool.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputer software 3aexperts 3aforest certification 3aforests 3anongovernmental organizations 3ascientists 3astakeholders 3asustainable forestry 3aRussia 0aForest certification mapping 0aFSC 0aPEFC 0aCitizen science 0aGeo-Wiki1 aSchepaschenko, Dmitry1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7814-49901 aFuss, Sabine1 aLunnan, Anders1 aKindermann, Georg1 aAoki, Kentaro1 aDürauer, Martina1 aShvidenko, Anatoly1 aSee, Linda0 tForest policy and economics.g2017 Oct., v. 83 p.10-18dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl64120x1389-93417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.forpol.2017.04.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03246naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245013100169300001600300520176800316592002802084650002302112650002602135650001902161650001202180650001002192650001002202650001102212650003202223650001602255650004802271650003102319650000902350650001002359651001202369653000902381653000902390653001102399653001702410653001302427700001702440700001702457700002402474700001702498700002402515773010702539856008502646852000902731655001202740IND60526267020221120193011.0190403e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052626702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetmic.2016.05.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFischer, Julia10aSimultaneous occurrence of MRSA and ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae on pig farms and in nasal and stool samples from farmers  ap. 107-113.  aMethicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) producing enterobacteria (ESBL-E) have emerged in livestock. This study prospectively investigates the prevalence of MRSA and ESBL-E on pig farms and in nasal and stool samples from farmers and compares molecular characteristics of these ESBL-E isolates.In 2014, samples were derived at 51 pig farms in Germany. Per farm, five dust and five fecal samples were collected; one nasal and one stool sample were retrieved from farmers. ESBL-E isolates from humans and environmental isolates from the respective farms were characterized using whole genome sequencing for classical multilocus sequence typing (MLST), determination of ESBL-encoding genes and an ad hoc core genome MLST (cgMLST) analysis.MRSA and ESBL-E were detected on 49 (96%) and 31 (61%) of the farms, respectively; in most cases (59%) simultaneously. Nasal MRSA carriage was detected in 72 of 85 (84.7%) farmers and five of 84 (6.0%) farmers carried ESBL-E. ESBL-Escherichia coli isolates from farmers belonged to MLST STs/ESBL-genes ST10/CTX-M-1, ST196/TEM-52, ST278/TEM-52, ST410/CTX-M-15 and ST453/CTX-M-1. In one case, the human ESBL-E isolate was clonally identical to isolates from the farm environment; in the other four cases typing results indicated potential exchange of resistance determinants between human and environmental isolates, but, comparing the isolates within a minimum spanning tree indicated differences in cgMLST-patterns between the farms (p=0.076).This study demonstrated rectal ESBL-E carriage rates among farmers, which were similar to those in the general population. Molecular typing suggested that cross-transmission between the farmers and the farm environment is possible.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEnterobacteriaceae 3aantibiotic resistance 3abeta-lactamase 3afarmers 3afeces 3agenes 3ahumans 3alivestock and meat industry 3amethicillin 3amethicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus 3amultilocus sequence typing 3anose 3aswine 3aGermany 0aESBL 0aMRSA 0acgMLST 0aWhole genome 0aZoonosis1 aHille, Katja1 aRuddat, Inga1 aMellmann, Alexander1 aKöck, Robin1 aKreienbrock, Lothar0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2017 Feb., v. 200 p.107-113dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8205x0378-11357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2016.05.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03013naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002200125024001900147040001800166100001500184245009600199300001800295506007600313520013300389520147100522592002801993506003702021650001602058650001102074650001702085650001602102650001702118650001002135650001502145700003202160700002202192700002102214700002102235700002202256700002802278700002902306700001902335773011502354856007702469852000902546655001202555IND60172062120221207115723.0150602e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017206212DNAL7 a10.1104/pp.114.2474452doi7 aPMC42560062pmcid7 a253156032pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSanz, Luis10aNitric Oxide Plays a Role in Stem Cell Niche Homeostasis through Its Interaction with Auxin  ap. 1972-1984.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aNitric oxide regulation of stem cell decisions in Arabidopsis roots is related to auxin biosynthesis, transport, and signaling .  aNitric oxide (NO) is a unique reactive nitrogen molecule with an array of signaling functions that modulates plant developmental processes and stress responses. To explore the mechanisms by which NO modulates root development, we used a pharmacological approach and NO-deficient mutants to unravel the role of NO in establishing auxin distribution patterns necessary for stem cell niche homeostasis. Using the NO synthase inhibitor and Arabidopsis ( Arabidopsis thaliana ) NO biosynthesis mutants ( nitric oxide-associated1 [ noa1 ], nitrate reductase1 [ nia1 ] and nia2 , and nia1 nia2 noa1 ), we show that depletion of NO in noa1 reduces primary root elongation and increases flavonol accumulation consistent with elevated reactive oxygen species levels. The elevated flavonols are required for the growth effect, because the transparent testa4 mutation reverses the noa1 mutant root elongation phenotype. In addition, noa1 and nia1 nia2 noa1 NO-deficient mutant roots display small root meristems with abnormal divisions. Concomitantly, auxin biosynthesis, transport, and signaling are perturbed. We further show that NO accumulates in cortex/endodermis stem cells and their precursor cells. In endodermal and cortical cells, the noa1 mutant acts synergistically to the effect of the wuschel-related homeobox5 mutation on the proximal meristem, suggesting that NO could play an important role in regulating stem cell decisions, which has been reported in animals.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis 3aauxins 3abiosynthesis 3ahomeostasis 3anitric oxide 3aroots 3astem cells1 aFerníández-Marcos, María1 aModrego, Abelardo1 aLewis, Daniel R.1 aMuday, Gloria K.1 aPollmann, Stephan1 aDueíáñas, Montserrat1 aSantos-Buelga, Celestino1 aLorenzo, Oscar0 tPlant physiology.g2014 Dec., v. 166, no. 4 p.1972-1984dAmerican Society of Plant Biologistsx0032-08897nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1104/pp.114.2474453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02259naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003100150245009000181520100800271592002801279650001701307650001101324650001701335650002101352650002301373650002801396650001101424650001801435653002601453653002101479653002001500653002801520653002301548653001901571700003001590700002901620700001601649773009001665856008501755852000901840655001201849IND60730094320221119064855.0220103e20210615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073009432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2021.1202302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaena-Moreno, Francisco M.10aExploring profitability of bioeconomy paths: Dimethyl ether from biogas as case study  aHerein a novel path is analysed for its economic viability to synergize the production of biomethane and dimethyl ether from biogas. We conduct a profitability analysis based on the discounted cash flow method. The results revealed an unprofitable process with high cost/revenues ratios. Profitable scenarios would be reached by setting prohibitive DME prices (1983–5566 €/t) or very high feed-in tariffs subsidies (95.22 €/MWh in the best case scenario). From the cost reduction side, the analysis revealed the need of reducing investment costs. For this purpose, we propose a percentage of investment as incentive scheme. Although the size increase benefits cost/revenues ratio, only the 1000 m³/h biogas plant size will reach profitability if 90% of the investment is subsidized. A sensitivity analysis to check the influence of some important economical parameters is also included. Overall this study evidences the big challenge that our society faces in the way towards a circular economy.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioeconomics 3abiogas 3acase studies 3acircular economy 3acost effectiveness 3aeconomic sustainability 3aenergy 3aprofitability 0aBiomethane production 0aBiogas upgrading 0aCO2 utilization 0aGreen energy production 0aWaste valorization 0aDimethyl ether1 aGonzalez-Castaño, Miriam1 aArellano-García, Harvey1 aReina, T.R.0 tEnergy.g2021 June 15, v. 225 p.120230-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2021.1202303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03816naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094024002300135024003800158024004500196040001800241100002100259245008100280300001400361506007600375506003100451520172900482592002802211596008302239506003702322650001202359650001302371650002602384650001402410650002402424650001702448650001102465650001102476650001102487650001202498650001502510650001602525650001402541650001002555650002602565650001102591650001702602651001602619653000902635653001102644653001602655653001802671653001202689653001302701653001802714700002102732700001902753700002202772700002202794773010902816856008502925856011403010961000903124852000903133655001203142IND60568144920221215143045.0190411e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056814492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.forpol.2017.04.0112chorus7 a10113/56814492hdl7 a10.1016/j.forpol.2017.04.0112doi7 a10.1016/j.forpol.2017.04.0112chorusOpen  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrala, Katarzyna10aImpact of human factors on wildfire occurrence in Mississippi, United States  ap. 38-47.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aFires have important ecological and socioeconomic effects in fire-prone regions globally. Human-caused wildfires often pose considerable safety and environmental hazards, and can result in sizeable economic losses. This study analyzed the relative importance of temporal, spatial, and socioeconomic factors on occurrence of 52,532 human-caused wildfires in Mississippi that burned during 1991–2005. The probability of human-caused wildfires was modeled using a multinomial logit regression for unordered nominal outcomes. Results indicated that in comparison to incendiary wildfires, other types of human-caused wildfires were most likely to occur in summer. Wildfires caused by equipment use, children, and debris burning were more likely than incendiary wildfires to occur in close proximity to primary roads and railroad tracks, whereas close proximity to population centers increased the relative likelihood of wildfires caused by debris burning. Socioeconomic characteristics also influenced occurrence of many human-caused wildfires. Wildfires caused by children and debris burning were more likely than incendiary wildfires to occur in densely populated areas, whereas wildfires caused by debris burning, equipment use, and related to smoking were more likely in areas with high unemployment rates and large proportions of people below the poverty level. Wildfires related to smoking were also more likely than incendiary wildfires to occur in areas with higher median income. These findings will be helpful in predicting wildfire occurrence as well as developing new wildfire awareness and prevention strategies, allocating resources, and reducing wildfire damage costs in Mississippi and other fire-prone regions.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000058250 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aburning 3achildren 3aenvironmental hazards 3aequipment 3afinancial economics 3aforest fires 3ahumans 3aincome 3apeople 3apoverty 3aprediction 3aprobability 3arailroads 3aroads 3asocioeconomic factors 3asummer 3aunemployment 3aMississippi 0aCost 0aDamage 0aProbability 0aSocioeconomic 0aSpatial 0aTemporal 0aWildfire type1 aGrala, Robert K.1 aHussain, Anwar1 aCooke, William H.1 aVarner, J.

Changes observed in BB were completely different to those observed in previous studies after treatment with the same FA either intraperitoneal (IP) or in vitro. Therefore, FA sensing in BB is apparently direct and not related to previous FA sensing in hypothalamus, but it could be influenced by changes in the levels of peripheral hormones like insulin. In contrast, results obtained after ICV treatment with FA in liver were comparable to those observed after IP treatment but different to those observed after in vitro treatment. Therefore, FA sensing in liver is apparently indirect and be the consequence of previous hypothalamic FA sensing followed by vagal and/or sympathetic outflow.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3afatty acid metabolism 3ahypothalamus 3ainsulin 3aliver 3aoleic acid1 aOtero‐Rodiño, C.1 aLópez‐Patiño, M.A.1 aMíguez, J.M.1 aSoengas, J.L.0 tAquaculture nutrition.g2015 Apr., v. 21, no. 2 p.194-205dBlackwell Sciencex1353-57737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/anu.121583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02566naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002900143245014600172520150500318592002801823650002701851650002001878650002001898650001101918650001501929650002401944700002501968700002601993700002802019773011902047856007702166852000902243655001202252IND60729279120221117223328.0210228e20210121xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072927912DNAL7 a10.3390/genes120201372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLertampaiporn, Supatcha 10aEnsemble-AMPPred: Robust AMP Prediction and Recognition Using the Ensemble Learning Method with a New Hybrid Feature for Differentiating AMPs  aAntimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are natural peptides possessing antimicrobial activities. These peptides are important components of the innate immune system. They are found in various organisms. AMP screening and identification by experimental techniques are laborious and time-consuming tasks. Alternatively, computational methods based on machine learning have been developed to screen potential AMP candidates prior to experimental verification. Although various AMP prediction programs are available, there is still a need for improvement to reduce false positives (FPs) and to increase the predictive accuracy. In this work, several well-known single and ensemble machine learning approaches have been explored and evaluated based on balanced training datasets and two large testing datasets. We have demonstrated that the developed program with various predictive models has high performance in differentiating between AMPs and non-AMPs. Thus, we describe the development of a program for the prediction and recognition of AMPs using MaxProbVote, which is an ensemble model. Moreover, to increase prediction efficiency, the ensemble model was integrated with a new hybrid feature based on logistic regression. The ensemble model integrated with the hybrid feature can effectively increase the prediction sensitivity of the developed program called Ensemble-AMPPred, resulting in overall improvements in terms of both sensitivity and specificity compared to those of currently available programs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantimicrobial peptides 3adata collection 3ainnate immunity 3amodels 3aprediction 3aregression analysis1 aVorapreeda, Tayvich 1 aHongsthong, Apiradee 1 aThammarongtham, Chinae 0 tGenes.g2021 Jan. 21, v. 12, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27140x2073-44257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/genes120201373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01527naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001700154245006100171300001400232520065300246592002800899650002200927650001800949650001100967700001900978700001500997773010501012856008801117990002301205852000901228655001201237IND60096157120221116171030.0141104e20130201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009615712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compbiomed.2012.11.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Ji-min,10aRFS: Efficient feature selection method based on R-value  ap. 91-99.  aFeature selection is one of the most important issues in classification. Many filter and wrapper methods have been proposed. Here, we propose a new efficient feature selection method based on the R-value, which is a measure that is used to capture the overlapped areas among classes in a feature. Our strategy was to select features that have low overlapping areas among classes. Proposed idea is simple, but powerful for feature selection. The experiment results showed that the proposed method is better than previous typical methods in many cases. Accordingly, the proposed method can be used in combination with other feature selection methods.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputer analysis 3adata analysis 3amodels1 aBatnyam, Nomin1 aOh, Sejong0 tComputers in Biology and Medicine.g2013 Feb. 1, v. 43, no. 2 p.91-99dElsevier Ltdx0010-48257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compbiomed.2012.11.0103Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02694naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245007700164300001600241520140400257592002801661650002501689650001101714650001401725650002001739650002301759650001001782650001501792650001401807650001401821650001001835651001201845653001101857653003901868653003901907653001501946653001601961653001401977653001001991700001702001700001102018700002202029773011302051856005102164852000902215655001202224IND50087037920221119225909.0140412e20121001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008703792DNAL7 a10.1080/07060661.2012.7221302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, K.10aVirulence of Puccinia striiformis on wheat and barley in central Alberta  ap. 551-561.  aSixty-one field collections of Puccinia striiformis, primarily from central Alberta during 2007–2008, were identified to be P. striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst) or P. striiformis f. sp. hordei (Psh) based on virulence on differential seedlings. Wheat differentials separated 38 Pst isolates into 13 pathotypes, with most pathotypes consisting of single isolates. Two pathotypes consisted of two isolates, and three pathotypes were represented by three, seven and 16 isolates. Wheat lines with resistance genes Yr1, Yr5, Yr15 and YrSP were resistant to all 13 pathotypes, while wheat lines with genes Yr10, Yr24 and Yr28 were resistant to 82–92% of the isolates. Differentials YrA, Yr2, Yr6, Yr7, Yr8, Yr9, Yr17, Yr26, Yr27, Yr31 and YrCV were susceptible to 71–100% of the isolates. Twenty-three Psh isolates were identified to 15 Psh pathotypes, with virulence on two to eight barley differentials, including ‘Topper’, ‘Hiproly’, ‘Varunda’, ‘Abed Binder 12’, ‘Trumpf’, ‘Mazurka’, ‘Bigo’, ‘I 5’ and ‘Bancroft’ and avirulent on ‘Heils Franken’, ‘Emir’ and ‘Astrix’. Ten pathotypes consisted of a single isolate, four pathotypes had two isolates and one pathotype consisted of five isolates. The possible origin and virulence of P. striiformis pathotypes in central Alberta is discussed in relation to using cultivar resistance for disease control.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPuccinia striiformis 3abarley 3acultivars 3adisease control 3adisease resistance 3agenes 3apathotypes 3aseedlings 3avirulence 3awheat 3aAlberta 0abarley 0aPuccinia striiformis f. sp. hordei 0aPuccina striiformis f. sp. tritici 0aresistance 0astripe rust 0avirulence 0awheat1 aHoltz, M.

This study aimed to create stable uremia via subtotal renal artery embolization in goats and induce a temporary further decline in kidney function by administration of gentamicin. Renal artery embolization was performed in five Dutch white goats by infusing polyvinyl alcohol particles in branches of the renal artery, aiming for the embolization of ~80% of one kidney and complete embolization of the contralateral kidney. Gentamicin was administered to temporarily further increase the plasma concentrations of uremic toxins. After initial acute kidney injury, urea and creatinine plasma concentrations stabilized 1.5 ± 0.7 months post-embolization and remained elevated (12 ± 1.4 vs. 5.6 ± 0.8 mmol/L and 174 ± 45 vs. 65 ± 5.6 µmol/L, resp.) during follow-up (16 ± 6 months). Gentamicin induced temporary acute-on-chronic kidney injury with a variable increase in plasma concentrations of small solutes (urea 29 ± 15 mmol/L, creatinine 841 ± 584 µmol/L, phosphate 2.2 ± 0.3 mmol/L and potassium 5.0 ± 0.6 mmol/L) and protein-bound uremic toxins representative of patients with ESKD. A uremic goat model characterized by stable moderate uremia was established via subtotal renal artery embolization with the induction of temporary severe acute-on-chronic kidney injury by the administration of gentamicin, allowing preclinical in vivo validation of novel renal replacement technologies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacute kidney injury 3aanimal models 3acreatinine 3agentamicin 3agoats 3akidneys 3aphosphates 3apolyvinyl alcohol 3apotassium 3arenal function 3aurea 3auremia1 ade Vries, Joost  C.1 aAhmed, Sabbir 1 aMonninkhof, Anneke  S.1 ade Kort, Gérard  A.

The most stable and best‐accepted diet was STA50 (SFR 1.26%BW day⁻¹) although there were no significant differences in the growth rates obtained with the three diets: 10.12 g day⁻¹, 9.37 g day⁻¹and 11.22 g day⁻¹for C0, GLU50 and STA50, respectively (P > 0.05). The feed efficiency indices were better for GLU50, of particular note being the protein productive value of 71.88% and a feed conversion ratio lower than 1. Protein and lipid digestibility were similar in all the three diets (96–98% for proteins and 85–94% for lipids), whereas carbohydrate digestibility was higher in GLU50 (98%) than in C0 (84%) and STA50 (0.33%). The content of carbohydrates increased in muscle and the digestive gland as a consequence of the increased carbohydrates intake.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOctopus vulgaris 3aSardinella aurita 3aTodarodes 3adiet 3adigestibility 3afeed conversion 3aglucose 3alipids 3amuscles 3aproteins 3astarch1 aCerezo Valverde, J.1 aAguado‐Giménez, F.1 aHernández, M.D.1 aGarcía García, B.0 tAquaculture nutrition.g2015 Apr., v. 21, no. 2 p.206-213dBlackwell Sciencex1353-57737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/anu.121523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03757naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002100153245007900174520218400253592002802437650003002465650001202495650002502507650001902532650001402551650001402565650001602579650001502595650001602610650001902626650002202645650000702667650001502674650002002689650001202709650002802721650001602749650001802765651001102783653000702794653000802801700003002809700005902839700001802898700002502916700001902941700001802960700002102978773011902999856008803118852000903206655001203215IND60679609920221121002606.0200503e20200410xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067960992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.1362602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAddison, Marc J.10aFluoride occurrence in the lower East African Rift System, Southern Malawi  aCountries located on the East African Rift System (EARS) are vulnerable to fluoride in their groundwater; a vulnerability for the developing country of Malawi at the southern rift periphery that is not well characterised. Groundwater fluoride occurrence in Malawi is documented here to better understand and manage fluoride risks posed. Available literature and Gov't of Malawi archive fluoride data spanning some fifty years have been collated and augmented by our own 2016–18 surveys of groundwater quality in Southern Malawi, targeting deep-sourced springs. In total, fluoride data for 1365 borehole, spring and hot spring samples were assembled. Statistically, 83% of samples were below the 1.5 mg/l WHO limit, concentrations in the 1.5–6 mg/l range between former (pre-1993) and current WHO guidelines at 14%, and those with fluoride above the current Malawi (former WHO) 6 mg/l guideline, at 3%. A lower occurrence than in other zones of the EARS, but indicative of a need for a Malawi Gov't management policy revision and associated management strategies endorsed by several documented incidences of dental fluorosis in proximity to high fluoride groundwater. Increased fluoride is related to increased groundwater temperatures signifying the importance of geothermal groundwater provenance. Temperature data may indeed be used as a proxy indicator of fluoride risk; samples with a temperature >32 °C, contained >6 mg/l fluoride. Structural geological controls appear to allow deep geothermal groundwaters to come to the near surface, as evidenced by increased fluoride in springs and boreholes close to faulted areas. Hydrochemical evaluation shows that fluoride concentrations are influenced by fluorite equilibration and sensitivity to calcium and pH. Recommendations are made to further document the occurrence of fluoride and enhance management of risks due to fluoride in drinking water in Malawi. With fluoride as a key indicator within Sustainable Development Goal number 6, the current Malawi standard and waters with concentration between 1.5 and 6 mg/l will come under increased scrutiny and pose a key challenge to assessment and management efforts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWorld Health Organization 3acalcium 3adeveloping countries 3adrinking water 3afluorides 3afluorosis 3agroundwater 3aguidelines 3ahot springs 3ahydrochemistry 3aissues and policy 3apH 3aprovenance 3arisk management 3asurveys 3asustainable development 3atemperature 3awater quality 3aMalawi 0aSB 0aLSB1 aRivett, M.

The results of protein fractions according to CNCPS shows a significant difference (p<0.05) among non-protein nitrogen (A), rapidly degradable true protein (B1), moderately degradable true protein (B2), slowly degradable true protein (B3) and undegradable true protein (C) fractions of almond meal in comparison to soybean meal and cottonseed meal. In regards to SDS-Page electrophoresis results, amandin protein was mainly composed of two major polypeptides with estimated MWs in the range 63-100 kDa (acidic polypeptides) and 20-35 kDa (basic polypeptides). Furthermore, two major polypeptides including β-Conglycinin (three subunits, α, ά, β with MWs of 91.83, 80.49 and 47.16 respectively) and glycinin (two acidic and basic subunits with MWs of 40 and 21.30 kDa respectively) were observed in soybean meal. The pattern of protein subunits in cottonseed meal shows four major polypeptides including Globulin 9S (with MWs of 78.36 and 71.10 kDa), Globulin 5S (with MW of 25.47 kDa) and Albumin 2S (with MW of 15.84 kDa).

In this respect, the characteristics of these configurations are investigated through three steps. Firstly, the mathematical model of each component is developed by employing experimental data. Subsequently, the optimal size of each topology is determined by a two-step optimization approach. This approach is based on the optimized sizing of power sources, employing a metaheuristic optimization algorithm, and optimal power flow sharing between the sources with the aim of satisfying the requested power while declining the fuel consumption and enhancing the system’s lifetime. Finally, the best-achieved size of each architecture is compared in terms of trip cost, capital cost, and the system weight. The obtained results show that passive topology can reduce the trip cost by 14.8% and 6.4% compared to full-active and semi-active ones, respectively. However, the active architecture results in less degradation in the FC compared to the other two topologies. Furthermore, a validation phase is done under a real driving profile and the results are further discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acapital costs 3aelectric vehicles 3aelectrochemical capacitors 3aenergy 3aenergy use and consumption 3afuel cells 3amathematical models 3atopology 3aviability 0aComponents sizing 0aEnergy management 0aPassive configuration 0aPEMFC 0aTwo-step optimization 0aUltracapacitor1 aKandidayeni, M.1 aBoulon, L.1 aTrovão, J.P.0 tEnergy.g2021 June 01, v. 224 p.120234-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2021.1202343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02233naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002100154245007800175300001600253520122400269592002801493650001701521650001501538650001001553650002401563650002001587650001101607700002901618700003301647773010701680856008801787990002301875852000901898655001201907IND60096157320221116171029.0141104e20130201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009615732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compbiomed.2012.11.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aForuzan, Amir H.10aSegmentation of brain tissues using a 3-D multi-layer Hidden Markov Model  ap. 121-130.  aTo compensate for bias field inhomogeneity and reduce noise, we incorporate domain-based knowledge and spatial information into a brain segmentation algorithm by proposing a new multi-layer Hidden Markov model. Brain tissues include Gray Matter (GM), White Matter (WM), and Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF). A typical slice of a brain image either contains GM, GM–WM or GM–WM–CSF. Therefore, we classify the slices into three classes by employing a 1-D Hidden Markov model in the first layer of our method. Corresponding to a class in the first layer, we use another 1-D Hidden Markov model for segmentation of the slices in the second layer. A 2-D slice is converted into a vector by concatenation of the individual rows. Then, it is segmented by a second layer model. We extensively evaluated our method using three public datasets including 5492 images. Our method proves the significant potential of the proposed multi-layer Hidden Markov model for segmentation of 3-D medical image in the presence of noise and field inhomogeneity. Regarding the IBSR_18 datasets, the proposed method improved the results of segmentation of White Matter and Gray Matter by 0.026 and 0.04, respectively, using Dice coefficient index.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMarkov chain 3aalgorithms 3abrain 3acerebrospinal fluid 3adata collection 3amodels1 aKalantari Khandani, Iman1 aBaradaran Shokouhi, Shahriar0 tComputers in Biology and Medicine.g2013 Feb. 1, v. 43, no. 2 p.121-130dElsevier Ltdx0010-48257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compbiomed.2012.11.0013Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01802naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245018900169300001800358520043500376592002800811650001200839650002300851650002300874650001700897650001700914650001700931650001900948650001200967650001000979700001500989700001701004700001701021700001601038700001701054700005101071700005701122773012101179856008301300852000901383655001201392IND60621254520221119063720.0181116e20181026xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062125452DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.8b030152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKadam, Vilas D.10aCascade C–H Annulation Reaction of Benzaldehydes, Anilines, and Alkynes toward Dibenzo[a,f]quinolizinium Salts: Discovery of Photostable Mitochondrial Trackers at the Nanomolar Level  ap. 7071-7075.  aFluorescent mitochondrial trackers with the dibenzo[a,f]quinolizinium core are unprecedentedly synthesized by a one-pot protocol starting from commercially available benzaldehydes, anilines, and alkynes through a rhodium(III)-catalyzed cascade C–H N- and C-annulation reaction.

S.10aCatalytic Oxidation of Aniline to Azoxybenzene Over CuCr2O4 Spinel Nanoparticle Catalyst  ap. 584-589.  aCationic surfactant cetyltrimethylammonium chloride-mediated hydrothermal preparation of CuCr₂O₄ spinel nanoparticles has been reported. This CuCr₂O₄ spinel nanoparticle catalyst has been characterized by XRD, XPS, SEM, TEM, TGA, and ICP-AES. Characterization results showed the formation of CuCr₂O₄ spinel nanoparticles with sizes between 25 and 50 nm. It was found that the catalyst can selectively convert aniline to azoxybenzene with H₂O₂ as oxidant. The effect of different reaction parameters like reaction temperature, H₂O₂ to aniline molar ratio, reaction time, and so forth have been studied in detail. An aniline conversion of 78% with azoxybenzene selectivity of 92% can be achieved over this catalyst at 70 °C. The catalyst did not show any leaching up to five reuses, showing the true heterogeneity of the catalyst. However, significant H₂O₂ decomposition occurs on the catalyst necessitating its usage in five-fold excess.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aaniline 3acatalysts 3acationic surfactants 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aleaching 3ananoparticles 3aoxidants 3aoxidation 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atemperature 3atransmission electron microscopy 0aCuCr2O4 0aSpinel 0aNanoparticles 0aAniline 0aAzoxybenzene 0aH2O2 0aOxidative coupling1 aGhosh, Shilpi1 aBal, Rajaram0 tACS sustainable chemistry .g2014 Apr. 07, v. 2, no. 4 p.584-589dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/sc50005453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02452naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005600148245006600204300001100270500001100281520142800292592002801720650003101748650001401779650001801793650001701811650001301828650002901841650002601870700002801896773011001924856008302034852000902117655001202126IND60736027020221120043030.0211128e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073602702DNAL7 a10.1007/s12041-021-01278-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRahul Kumar,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8320-786110aTranscription factor stoichiometry in cell fate determination  ap. 27.  aReview  aTranscription factors play very important role in cell fate determination. There are many cell specific transcription factors which when expressed ectopically may lead to cell fate conversion or transdifferentiation. Many of these transcription factors function differently based on their levels and stoichiometry. Many different types of differentiated cells have been generated from other differentiated cell types by expressing different levels and stoichiometry of reprogramming factors. Many methodologies have been developed for efficient cell fate conversion by regulating the levels and stoichiometry of transcription factors in a particular cocktail that have therapeutic values. An approach called phenotypic activation which involves overexpression of putative transcription factors has been developed as a tool to discover new transcription factors and their targets. Transcription factor overexpression may also have toxic effects where non-specific electrostatic interactions and ‘squelching’ may lead to inhibition of many genes. Altered levels of transcription factors may have disastrous consequences like cancer. Recent developments like designing of artificial transcription factors, nanotechnology-based transcriptional tools and CRISPR-based transcription modules with capabilities of precise regulation of gene expression patterns hold huge potentials in the field of transcriptional therapeutics.  aPublisher supplied data 3agene expression regulation 3aphenotype 3astoichiometry 3atherapeutics 3atoxicity 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors1 aSharamā, Ajai Kumāra,0 tJournal of genetics.g2021 Oct., v. 100, no. 2 p.27-27dSpringer IndiawJournal:jnl16319x0022-13337nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12041-021-01278-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02958naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100003900145245010600184300001400290520158200304592002801886650002001914650004301934650000901977650001201986650001501998650002302013650002102036650002002057650002202077650000902099650002102108650001202129651001102141700002902152700002402181700002302205700003502228700003102263700003002294773009802324856008102422852000902503655001202512IND4473267420221119173333.0141110e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447326742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bse.2011.12.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Mendonça, Patrícia Calligioni10aGenetic diversity of Stryphnodendron adstringens (Mart.)

Coville a Leguminosae species, well known in Brazil as barbatimão, are popularly used as healing agent. The objective of this work was to determine the genetic diversity of S. adstringens populations and to correlate genetic distances to the production of tannins. S. adstringens accessions from populations found in Cerrado regions in the states of Goiás, Minas Gerais and São Paulo were analyzed using the AFLP (Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism) technique. A total of 236 polymorphic bands were scored and higher proportion of genetic diversity was found inter populations (70.9%), rather than intra populations (29.1%). FST value was found to be significantly greater than zero (0.2906), demonstrating the complex genetic structure of S. adstringens populations. Accessions collected in Cristalina, GO, showed higher percentage of polymorphic loci (87.3%) and the highest genetic diversity. The lowest genetic variability was detected among accessions from the population growing in Caldas Novas, GO. The genetic distance among populations was estimated using the Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean (UPGMA), which grouped populations into 3 clusters. Moreover, chemotypes with tannin concentration above 40% showed higher genetic similarity. AFLP analysis proved to be an efficient gene mapping technique to determine the genetic diversity among remaining populations of S. adstringens. Obtained results may be employed to implement further strategies for the conservation of this medicinal plant.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStryphnodendron 3aamplified fragment length polymorphism 3abark 3acerrado 3achemotypes 3achromosome mapping 3agenetic distance 3agenetic markers 3agenetic variation 3aloci 3amedicinal plants 3atannins 3aBrazil1 aBertoni, Bianca Waléria1 aAmui, Saulo França1 aGiuliatti, Silvana1 aCorrêa, Valéria Sieiro Conde1 aFrança, Suzelei de Castro1 aPereira, Ana Maria Soares0 tBiochemical systematics and ecology.g2012 Apr., v. 41 p.16-20dElsevier Ltdx0305-19787nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bse.2011.12.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03558naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006200139245011400201300001600315520212400331592002802455650001602483650002102499650002502520650001902545650001102564650002002575650001402595650001002609650001102619650001502630650001402645650002302659650001202682650002102694650002302715650001302738651001602751653001202767653002002779653002602799653001102825653001602836700002302852773010602875856007402981852000903055655001203064IND60694880320221120134027.0210209e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069488032DNAL7 a10.3382/ps/pez5622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Jong, Ingrid C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1811-499X10aRelative contribution of production chain phases to health and performance of broiler chickens: a field study  ap. 179-188.  aThere is increasing evidence that health and performance of the breeder flock significantly contributes to health and performance of their progeny. Data of broiler performance and health are routinely collected in various stages of the broiler production chain. In the Netherlands, the broiler chain operates at a relatively non-integrated level and the various databases are usually not connected. Connecting databases may however provide important information to improve chain performance. The aim of the present study was to determine systematic effects of broiler breeder production farm or flock on health (mortality and antibiotics use) and performance of their offspring, using data routinely collected at the different stages of the production chain. Broiler flock data collected over 6 yr (daily growth, slaughter weight, carcass weight uniformity, carcass condemnations, first week and total mortality, and antibiotics use) were linked to breeder flocks and farms. In total, 2,174 broiler flock records (at house level) of 74 broiler farms were linked to 88 broiler breeder farms and 209 breeder flocks. A mixed model analysis was applied to simultaneously estimate effects of season, parent flock age, time trend, and the contribution of the different chain phases to broiler performance and health. No systematic effects of breeder farm and only small systematic effects of breeder flock on broiler health and performance were found. The largest breeder flock effect was found for carcass condemnations (estimated contribution to the variance component: 7%). Most variation on broiler health and performance was explained by broiler farm and “day-old chick batch.” The latter refers to the rest variance that could not be explained by other factors, i.e., incidental effects linked to the specific day-old chick batch and the stage between the breeder and broiler farm. Our results suggest that systematic effects of breeder flock and farm could have been overruled by (management in) the hatchery phase and the broiler farm. This indicates room for improvement of management in these production phases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibiotics 3abroiler breeders 3acarcass condemnation 3acarcass weight 3achicks 3adata collection 3adatabases 3afarms 3aflocks 3ahatcheries 3amortality 3apoultry production 3aprogeny 3aslaughter weight 3astatistical models 3avariance 3aNetherlands 0abroiler 0abroiler breeder 0aproduction chain data 0ahealth 0aperformance1 avan Riel, Johan W.0 tPoultry science.g2020 Jan., v. 99, no. 1 p.179-188dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45501x0032-57917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps/pez5623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02953naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245009400169300001400263520193200277592002802209650001602237650001002253650001402263650001402277650003302291650001402324650001102338650001202349650001602361700002102377773008702398856008602485990002302571852000902594655001202603IND60092002620221118033839.0141103e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009200262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.buildenv.2011.09.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Jungsoo10aNonlinear relationships between individual IEQ factors and overall workspace satisfaction  ap. 33-40.  aDespite a paucity of rigorous scientific evidence causally linking Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ) issues to office occupants’ productivity, there is a widespread belief that such causality exists; excellent or poor IEQ translate into productivity gains or losses respectively. The aim of this study is to better understand relationship between perceived building performance on specific IEQ factors and occupants’ overall satisfaction with their workspace. Kano’s satisfaction model, developed originally in the context of marketing, is adapted and tested for its suitability in the context of building occupants’ satisfaction. Analyses were conducted on the occupant survey database from Center for the Built Environment (CBE) to estimate individual impacts of 15 IEQ factors on occupants’ overall satisfaction, depending on the building’s performance in relation to those IEQ factors. These empirical analyses identified nonlinearities between some IEQ factors and occupant satisfaction; some IEQ factors had a predominantly negative impact on occupants’ overall satisfaction when the building underperformed. These have been labelled Basic Factors in the Kano Model of satisfaction and include ‘temperature’, ‘noise level’, ‘amount of space’, ‘visual privacy’, ‘adjustability of furniture’, ‘colours & textures’ and ‘workspace cleanliness’. Other IEQ factors had a predominantly linear relationship with overall satisfaction – increments or decrements of equal magnitude in the building’s performance on these factors lead to a broadly similar magnitude of enhancement or diminution of occupants’ overall satisfaction. These were labelled Proportional Factors, and include ‘air quality’, ‘amount of light’, ‘visual comfort’, ‘sound privacy’, ‘ease of interaction’, ‘comfort of furnishing’, ‘building cleanliness’ and ‘building maintenance’.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair quality 3acolor 3adatabases 3afurniture 3aindoor environmental quality 3amarketing 3amodels 3asurveys 3atemperature1 ade Dear, Richard0 tBuilding and environment.g2012 Mar., v. 49 p.33-40dElsevier Ltdx0360-13237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2011.09.0223Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02044naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245011100173300001600284520096300300592002801263650001701291650001701308650001501325650001501340650001301355651001201368653001601380653001701396653002501413653002901438653002301467773011001490856008501600852000901685655001201694IND60747233520221119004416.0210812e20210818xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074723352DNAL7 a10.1080/01426397.2021.19186532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHautamäki, Ranja10aConstructing the green wedge in the planning discourse - a case study of Central Park in Helsinki, Finland  ap. 878-893.  aThis article explores the construction of the green wedge in the planning discourse in Helsinki’s Central Park over three phases: its establishment in the early twentieth century, the first statutory plan of the 1970s and in the present context. Often described in quantitative methods emphasising physical and spatial qualities, the study instead examines the conceptual and historical dimensions of the park. The thematic analysis of the planning discourse looks at four principles characteristic of the green wedge model— the relationship between the park and the city; the continuity and connection from the centre to the outskirts; recreation and health; and nature as beauty and biodiversity. With the focus on the consistencies and changes, this study highlights the resilience of this over 100-year-old green wedge and demonstrates that Central Park has been able to accommodate new needs and functions while sustaining most of its original aims.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3acase studies 3alandscapes 3arecreation 3aresearch 3aFinland 0aGreen wedge 0apark systems 0agreen space planning 0aCentral Park of Helsinki 0aplanning discourse0 tLandscape research.g2021 Aug. 18, v. 46, no. 6 p.878-893dRoutledgewJournal:J000000120x1469-97107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01426397.2021.19186533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02834naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001300148245012700161300001400288520114800302592002801450650001501478650001201493650001401505650001501519650003401534650002101568650002201589650002201611650001001633650001901643650001301662650002401675650001501699650001101714650001101725650002201736650001001758653001901768653002101787653002101808653003401829653002301863700001401886700001601900700001701916700001901933700001501952700001501967700001501982700001301997700001402010700001602024773010002040856008302140852000902223655001202232IND60674800320221118033455.0200330e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067480032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcat.2019.10.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChi, Kai10aOxygen vacancies engineered CoMoO4 nanosheet arrays as efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts for overall water splitting  ap. 44-52.  aThe development of highly efficient, stable and earth-abundant bifunctional electrocatalysts for water splitting is of great significance for confronting the environmental and energy crisis. In this work, we reported the design and synthesis of oxygen vacancies engineered CoMoO₄ nanosheet arrays grown on three-dimension (3D) porous Ni foam (NF) support by hydrothermal synthesis followed by reducing gas heat treatment used H₂ or NH₃, and explored their practical application as bifunctional electrocatalysts for water splitting. The unique 3D nanosheet array can facilitate the interfacial electron transfer and ion transport, as well as promote hydrogen and oxygen gas diffusion, and the formation of oxygen vacancies in CoMoO₄ nanosheets can significantly improve efficiency of both hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction. When using as self-supported bifunctional electrocatalyst to make an electrolyzer, NF/H-CoMoO₄ approached 10 mA cm⁻² under the cell voltages of 1.56 V, along with excellent durability in an alkaline water electrolyzer, which hold great promise in energy conversion application.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkalinity 3aammonia 3acatalysts 3adurability 3aelectric potential difference 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectron transfer 3aenergy conversion 3afoams 3aheat treatment 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen production 3ananosheets 3anickel 3aoxygen 3aoxygen production 3awater 0aOxygen vacancy 0aCobalt molybdate 0aNanosheet arrays 0aBifunctional electrocatalysts 0aWater electrolysis1 aTian, Xin1 aWang, Qijun1 aZhang, Zheye1 aZhang, Xiangyu1 aZhang, Yan1 aJing, Feng1 aLv, Qiying1 aYao, Wei1 aXiao, Fei1 aWang, Shuai0 tJournal of catalysis.g2020 Jan., v. 381 p.44-52dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11700x0021-95177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcat.2019.10.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03339naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002000188245010800208300001400316500001500330506007600345520159700421592002802018506003702046650001402083650001302097650001602110650001602126650001902142650001902161650001402180650001302194650001102207650001502218650002102233650001402254650002502268650002202293650001902315650001602334650002302350650002102373651001002394653001002404700001902414700001802433700001702451700001902468700002202487700002202509700001902531773009702550856008102647852000902728655001202737IND50069773320221207112155.0150209e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006977332DNAL7 a10.1007/s12042-013-9124-22doi7 aPMC38695992pmcid7 a243638192pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShen-Miller, J.10aThermal-Stable Proteins of Fruit of Long-Living Sacred Lotus Nelumbo nucifera Gaertn var.

China Antique from NE China have been shown to remain viable for as long as ~1,300 years, determined by direct radiocarbon-dating, and to have a germination rate of 84 %. The pericarp, a fruit tissue that encloses the single seeds of Nelumbo, is one of the major factors contributing to fruit longevity. Proteins that are heat stable and have a protective function are equally important to such centuries-long seed viability. We document proteins of Nelumbo fruit that are able to withstand heating, 32 % of which remained soluble in the 110 °C-treated embryo axis of a 549-year-old fruit and 76 % retained fluidity in its cotyledons. The genome of Nelumbo has recently been published and annotated. The amino-acid sequences of 11 “thermal proteins” (soluble at 100 °C) of modern Nelumbo embryo axes and cotyledons, identified by mass spectrometry, Western blot and bioassay, are assembled and aligned with those of an archaeal hyperthermophile Methancaldococcus jannaschii (“Mj,” an anaerobic methanogen having a growth optimum of 85 °C) and with those of five mesophile angiosperms. These thermal proteins have roles in protection and repair under stress. More than half (55 %) of the durable Nelumbo thermal proteins are present in the archaean Mj, indicating their ancient history. One Nelumbo protein-repair enzyme exhibits activity at 100 °C, having a heat-tolerance higher than the comparable enzyme of Arabidopsis. A list of 30 sequenced but unassembled thermal proteins of Nelumbo is appended.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aviability 3aproteins 3aArabidopsis 3agermination 3aheat stability 3aheat tolerance 3alongevity 3apericarp 3agenome 3acotyledons 3aWestern blotting 3abioassays 3aamino acid sequences 3amass spectrometry 3aheat treatment 3amethanogens 3aradiocarbon dating 3aNelumbo nucifera 3aChina 0aseeds1 aLindner, Petra1 aXie, Yongming1 aVilla, Sarah1 aWooding, Kerry1 aClarke, Steven G.1 aLoo, Rachel R.

In this study, appraisal theory and research into human responses to natural environments formed the basis of a systematic multilevel investigation of appraisals of created wetland areas. The aim was to explore how appraisals could be used as a bottom–up approach to assessing the perceived contribution of wetland areas s to people’s quality of life (QoL). In total, 111 participants assessed environmental perceptions, affective experiences, and restorative potentials on site at three wetlands in Sweden. The results indicate that wetland areas and specific places with different ecological functions within these areas were appraised significantly differently. Moreover these places were perceived to support various QoL aspects to different degrees. Concepts and methods tested here give environmental planners hands-on tools for facilitating communication with expected users about the cultural ecosystem services of created wetland areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aecological function 3aecosystem services 3ahumans 3aquality of life 3awetlands 3aSweden 0aCreated wetland areas 0aCultural ecosystem services 0aEnvironmental appraisal 0aQuality of life1 aPedersen, Eja1 aWeisner, Stefan0 tUrban forestry & urban greening.g2019 Mar., v. 39 p.79-88dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl893556x1618-86677nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ufug.2019.02.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03768naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100005900137245009900196300001600295520228500311592002802596650002302624650001002647650001502657650001602672650001302688650002202701650001202723650002102735650001302756650001402769651002202783653002102805653000802826653001602834653000802850653002102858653001702879700001802896700001802914700002302932700002102955700001902976700001602995700006203011773010803073856007203181852000903253655001203262IND60759933320221121140755.0211216s2021    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075993332DNAL7 a10.1071/WR201182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaker, G.

Monitoring feral cats through the use of detection dogs could provide a useful technique to complement existing feral cat survey and control methods. AimTo demonstrate and quantify the ability of trained detection dogs to reliably and efficiently detect feral cat scats when present in woodland conservation reserves in the Wheatbelt of Western Australia. MethodsCat scats were randomly placed into 466 1.5 ha (150 m × 100 m) quadrats in Tutanning Nature Reserve, Western Australia, and the location of the scat was recorded. Quadrats were then independently searched by dogs walking a central transect line and the locations of all scats detected were recorded, with the distance from the scat to the transect subsequently being calculated. Data collected allowed the relationship between distance from the transect and detection probability to be used to assist modelling of detection probabilities. Key resultsDogs detected scats in 213 (55%) of 384 quadrats that were searched using a single transect line method. All indications of a find by the detector dogs were associated with a cat scat (no false indications). Detection probabilities for scats declined with distance from the transect line and with an increasing age of the scat. Simulations to investigate management options for cat control programs quantified effort required to detect cat scats under varying densities. ConclusionDogs were highly efficient at detecting scats within the woodland environment of the Western Australian wheatbelt. The effort required to detect a scat was considerably higher when cat density was low. ImplicationsOn the basis of the detection probabilities derived from the present study, trained scat-detection dogs can be expected to efficiently search woodlands and find cat scats by using an effective sweep width of 100 m (50 m either side of a transect) when scats are fresh. Sweep widths need to be reduced significantly if it is important to locate scats that have been exposed to the elements for greater periods of time, or to search habitats where terrain and vegetation cover are more challenging.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconservation areas 3afeces 3alandscapes 3aprobability 3aresearch 3aspecies abundance 3asurveys 3avegetation cover 3awildlife 3awoodlands 3aWestern Australia 0aCanis familiaris 0adog 0aFelis catus 0acat 0ainvasive species 0apest control1 aCandy, Steven1 aRobinson, Sue1 aFriend, J.

The fractionation of different sulfur isotopes provides clues to which biogeochemical cycles were active long ago (see the Perspective by Ueno). Zhelezinskaia et al. found negative isotope anomalies in Archean rocks from Brazil and posit that metabolic fluxes from sulfate-reducing microorganisms influenced the global sulfur cycle, including sulfur in the atmosphere. In contrast, Paris et al. found positive isotope anomalies in Archean sediments from South Africa, implying that the marine sulfate pool was more disconnected from atmospheric sulfur. As an analog for the Archean ocean, Crowe et al. measured sulfur isotope signatures in modern Lake Matano, Indonesia, and suggest that low seawater sulfate concentrations restricted early microbial activity.

The objective of this article is to carry out a sustainability assessment of a BIPV system installed in Turkey regarding the three pillars: environmental, economic and social potential impact, in order to develop different indicators. For the socioeconomic analysis, a Multiregional Input-Output (MRIO) method was used to estimate production of goods and services, value added creation and employment opportunities. For the environmental evaluation, an Environmental Footprint (EF) analysis was performed. The levelized electricity costs and the greenhouse gas emissions abatement costs were also calculated. Results showed that the socioeconomic effects are relevant, although only a 23% of these effects remain in Turkey. The environmental profile is also good in terms of climate change impacts, showing substantial reductions in greenhouse gas emissions compared to fossil fuel alternatives for electricity generation. Regarding the life cycle stages of the technology, the highest environmental impacts are produced in the PV manufacturing processes. The electricity produced is still more costly than fossil-based technologies and in the highest range of PV technologies, but greenhouse gases abatement costs are not so high when compared to other references.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3aecological footprint 3aelectricity 3aelectricity costs 3aelectricity generation 3aemployment opportunities 3aenvironmental assessment 3aenvironmental impact 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agreenhouse gases 3amanufacturing 3aphotovoltaic cells 3apublic services and goods 3asolar energy 3avalue added 3aTurkey (country) 0aBuilding integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) 0aSustainability 0aMulti-regional input-output (MRIO) 0aEnvironmental footprint (EF) 0aLife cycle assessment (LCA)1 aHerrera, Israel1 aRodríguez-Serrano, Irene1 aLechón, Yolanda,1 aHepbasli, Arif1 aAraz, Mustafa1 aBiyik, Emrah1 aYao, Rumming1 aShahrestani, Mehdi1 aEssah, Emmanuel1 aShao, Li1 aRico, Elena1 aLechón, Juan Luis1 aOliveira, Armando C.0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2020 Sept. 01, v. 266 p.121946-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1219463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01776naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245010300169300001800272520079500290592002801085650000901113650001701122650001201139650001801151650002201169650003701191700002001228700002001248773009901268856008601367852000901453655001201462IND60577485320221119140356.0170809e20160705xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057748532DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.6b015922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeng, Xianghua10aLigand Controlled Morphology Evolution of Active Intermediates for the Syntheses of Gold Nanostars  ap. 6674-6681.  aGold nanostars have unique plasmonic properties that are related to the highly branched nanostructures. However, it is challenging to precisely control these branches. Here we studied the reaction kinetics on the seed-mediated growth process of gold nanostars using in situ UV–vis spectroscopy. The impact of hydroquinone ligands on the formation and evolution of active intermediates was systematically explored. In addition, we improved the classical seed-mediated method to achieve a much better control on the final morphology of gold nanostars by a sudden addition of a high concentration ligand solution. Our method can significantly advance the syntheses of gold nanostars and provide numerous opportunities to prepare nanomaterials with unique morphology and plasmonic properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3agold 3ahydroquinone 3aligands 3ananomaterials 3areaction kinetics 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy1 aBaride, Aravind1 aJiang, Chaoyang0 tLangmuir.g2016 July 05, v. 32, no. 26 p.6674-6681dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.langmuir.6b015923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03859naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001800166245011900184300001600303520198300319592002802302650002302330650001502353650002702368650002202395650002002417650001102437650002102448650001502469650002302484650001202507650001502519650000902534650001402543650007302557650001202630650001802642650004802660650003902708650004102747650001102788650004202799650001302841650002202854650001602876650002502892650000902917700001802926700001602944700001902960700001902979700001802998773011603016856008103132990002303213852000903236655001203245IND60093647420221116232724.0141103e20120530xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009364742DNAL7 a225430152pmid7 a10.1016/j.cbi.2012.04.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJung, Hyun Ah10aKinetics and molecular docking studies of kaempferol and its prenylated derivatives as aldose reductase inhibitors  ap. 110-118.  aAldose reductase inhibitors (ARIs) suppressing the hyperglycemia-induced polyol pathway have been provided as potential therapeutic candidates in the treatment and prevention of diabetic complications. Based upon structure–activity relationships of desmethylanhydroicaritin (1) and sophoflavescenol (2) as promising ARIs, 3,4′-dihydroxy flavonols with a prenyl or lavandulyl group at the C-8 position and a hydroxyl or methoxy group at the C-5 position are important for aldose reductase (AR) inhibition. In order to prove the above results, a combination of computational prediction and enzyme kinetics has begun to emerge as an effective screening technique for the potential. In the present study, we predicted the 3D structure of AR in rat and human using a docking algorithm to simulate binding between AR and prenylated flavonoids (1 and 2) and kaempferol (3) and scrutinized the reversible inhibition of AR by these ARIs. Docking simulation results of 1–3 demonstrated negative binding energies (Autodock 4.0=−9.11 to −7.64kcal/mol; Fred 2.0=−79.54 to −51.84kcal/mol) and an additional hydrogen bond through Phe122 and Trp219, in addition to the previously proposed interaction of AR and phenolics through Trp20, Tyr48, His110, and Trp111 residues, indicating that the presence of 8-prenyl and 5-methyl groups might potentiate tighter binding to the active site of the enzyme and more effective AR inhibitors. Moreover, types of AR inhibition were different depending on the presence or absence of the 8-prenyl group, in that 1 and 2 are mixed inhibitors with respective Kᵢ values of 0.69μM and 0.94μM, while 3 showed noncompetitive inhibition with a Kᵢ value of 4.65μM. The present study suggests that an effective strategy for screening potential ARIs could be established by predicting 3D structural conformation of prenylated flavonoids and the orientation within the enzyme as well as by simultaneously determining the mode of enzyme inhibition.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaldehyde reductase 3aalgorithms 3adiabetic complications 3aenzyme inhibition 3aenzyme kinetics 3ahumans 3ahydrogen bonding 3akaempferol 3aphenolic compounds 3apolyols 3aprediction 3arats 3ascreening 2aAldehyde Reductasexantagonists & inhibitorsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aAnimals 2aBinding Sites 2aEnzyme Inhibitorsxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aFlavonesxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aFlavonoidsxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aHumans 2aKaempferolsxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aKinetics 2aModels, Molecular 2aPrenylation 2aProtein Conformation 2aRats1 aMoon, Hye Eun1 aOh, Sang Ho1 aKim, Byung-Woo1 aSohn, Hee Sook1 aChoi, Jae Sue0 tChemico-biological interactions.g2012 May 30, v. 197, no. 2-3 p.110-118dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0009-27977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cbi.2012.04.0043Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03089naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001200151245012700163520145400290592002801744650001301772650001501785650001401800650002401814650001701838650001901855650002101874650001101895650002101906650001901927650001901946650001101965650001901976650001801995650001602013650002002029650001102049653002102060653001602081653002602097653001702123653002302140653002602163700001702189700002002206700001902226700001702245700001302262700001902275700002002294773011402314856008602428852000902514655001202523IND60694088620221120110803.0200804e20200920xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069408862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1219502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yun10aSustainable phase-conversion method for antimony extraction and sulfur conservation and waste treatment at low temperature  aThis work proposes a novel environmentally-friendly, low temperature phase-conversion method for antimony extraction and studies its experimental application and feasibility in pyrite cinder waste co-treatment. The detailed phase transformations and microstructural evolution mechanisms during antimony extraction and sulfur fixation process were investigated. The results show that stibnite (Sb₂S₃) can quickly transform to senarmontite (Sb₂O₃) in the presence of Fe₂O₃ and Na₂CO₃, and then Sb₂O₃ will be continuously reduced into metallic Sb. Sulfur in Sb₂S₃ was conserved as FeS and Na₂SₓOy (Na₂S, Na₂SO₄ and/or Na₂S₂O₃). As a result, sulfur was immobilized and recycled in the solid state resource, instead of emitting SO₂ gas. Laboratory-scale batch experiments employed pyrite cinder as sulfur-fixing agent indicate that more than 92.6% of antimony can be extracted and recovered by one step conversion from stibnite at 1123 K (850 °C) by this new technique. 97.3% of sulfur was fixed and converted to sulfide as matte and sulfate. In other words, SO₂ emissions were reduced by 97.3%. By-product elemental sulfur was produced after the water-leaching step, and finally producing industrial H₂SO₄. Iron contained in pyrite cinder waste will also be recycled. This novel method is an energy-saving, environmentally friendly and promising alternative for antimony extraction and waste treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantimony 3abyproducts 3aemissions 3aenergy conservation 3aferric oxide 3amicrostructure 3aphase transition 3apyrite 3asodium carbonate 3asodium sulfate 3asodium sulfide 3asulfur 3asulfur dioxide 3asulfuric acid 3atemperature 3awaste treatment 3awastes 0aPhase conversion 0aMolten salt 0aIron-containing waste 0aSO2 emission 0aReaction mechanism 0aDistribution behavior1 aXue, Haotian1 aTaskinen, Pekka1 aYang, Shenghai1 aTang, Chaobo1 aJin, Wei1 aChen, Yongming1 aJokilaakso, Ari0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2020 Sept. 20, v. 268 p.121950-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1219503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03349naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005300144245011700197300002000314520172500334592002802059650000802087650001302095650001402108650001202122650003402134650001502168650001602183650002602199650001502225650001702240650001302257650001402270650001102284650002102295650001202316650001602328650000902344650001502353653001702368653001802385653002502403653001902428653002602447700002002473700001702493700001502510700005302525773014202578856007802720852000902798655001202807IND60654265120221119151650.0190724e20190625xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065426512DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.9b079772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeng, Lei1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9794-062910aSurface Modification of Al-Doped ZnO Transparent Conducive Thin Films with Polycrystalline Zinc Molybdenum Oxide  ap. 26491-26499.  aHigh-work function (WF) transparent conductive thin films improve the performance of solar cells and organic light-emitting diodes by facilitating interfacial charge carrier transport. Al-doped ZnO (AZO) becomes a very promising transparent conductive material because of nontoxicity, abundant material resources, and low cost. To increase the WF of AZO without enhancing the series resistance of the device, a high-WF and low-resistance surface modifier of polycrystalline zinc molybdenum oxide (ZMO) was developed by utilizing thermal evaporation of MoO₃ on the surface of AZO and a subsequent two-step annealing treatment. The first step of air annealing causes the formation of monoclinic ZnMoO₄ nanocrystals in the ZMO modifier. This improves the WF of AZO from 3.83 to 4.86 eV by increasing the group electronegativity and cation oxidation state. Furthermore, the second step of N₂ annealing decreases the resistivity of the polycrystalline ZMO by increasing the donor states of oxygen vacancies. The surface modification effect is verified by applying the ZMO-modified AZO to the front electrode of hydrogenated amorphous silicon thin-film solar cells. The low-resistance polycrystalline ZMO modifier not only increases light harvesting in the solar cells by improving interfacial refractive index matching but also improves the open-circuit voltage by modifying the interfacial band alignment. In particular, the modifier increases the fill factor by ca. 13% by reducing the series resistance of the device. These enable a gain of ca. 23% in photoelectric conversion efficiency compared to the unmodified AZO. The results suggest the feasibility to tune the WF and conductivity of a material independently.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aaluminum 3aannealing 3acations 3aelectric potential difference 3aelectrodes 3aevaporation 3alight emitting diodes 3amolybdenum 3ananocrystals 3anitrogen 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3arefractive index 3asilicon 3asolar cells 3azinc 3azinc oxide 0aAl-doped ZnO 0awork function 0asurface modification 0alow-resistance 0athin-film solar cells1 aYang, Xiaoguang1 aChai, Hongyu1 aLv, Zunren1 aYang, Tao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2132-24420 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2019 June 25, v. 11, no. 29 p.26491-26499dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b079773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03493naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002900151242018400180245018100364300001600545520117700561592002801738596005401766650002101820650002101841650001501862650002701877650002601904650002701930650002901957650002501986650001502011650001502026650002102041650001002062650002602072650002502098650003002123650002802153650001102181650002002192650001302212650002102225651001702246651001202263653002102275653002102296653003102317653002502348700002302373700003002396700002902426700003102455700002602486700002002512700002602532700002502558700003002583773012402613856008502737852000902822655001202831IND60694441420221120103910.0200513e20180527xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069444142DNAL7 a10.1080/00218839.2018.14263492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aValdés-Silverio, Luis A10aParámetros fisicoquímicos, composición química, capacidad antioxidante, contaminación microbiana y actividad antimicrobiana de la miel de Eucalyptus de los Andes ecuatorianos10aPhysicochemical parameters, chemical composition, antioxidant capacity, microbial contamination and antimicrobial activity of Eucalyptus honey from the Andean region of Ecuador  ap. 382-394.  aThis study aims to evaluate the pollen profile, physicochemical parameters, chemical composition, antioxidant capacity, microbial contamination and antimicrobial activity of Eucalyptus honey from the Andean region of Ecuador. Aerobic mesophiles, molds and yeasts, fecal coliforms and sulfite-reducing clostridia contamination were also assessed. All honey samples met the quality standards required by international legislation, except for hydroxymethylfurfural, for which three samples did not satisfy international standards. Apparent phenolic and flavonoid content, as well as free amino acid and protein content fell within the ranges previously reported for other types of honey of distinct floral and geographical origins. No microbial contamination was observed, while total antioxidant capacity showed evidence of the Eucalyptus honey’s ability to reduce Fe³⁺ to Fe²⁺ as well as to verify the superoxide radical scavenging activity and metal ion chelating capacity. Eucalyptus honey was able to inhibit the growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli, but was not effective against Candida albicans.  aPublisher supplied data  aVET.JMA.17.01a2017cUniversidad de Las Américas 3aCandida albicans 3aEscherichia coli 3aEucalyptus 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aStreptococcus pyogenes 3aantimicrobial properties 3aantioxidant activity 3aapiculture 3aflavonoids 3afree amino acids 3ahoney 3ahydroxymethylfurfural 3alaws and regulations 3amesophilic microorganisms 3amicrobial contamination 3apollen 3aprotein content 3aresearch 3asuperoxide anion 3aAndes region 3aEcuador 0aEcuadorian honey 0aEucalyptus honey 0aphysicochemical parameters 0aantioxidant capacity1 aIturralde, Gabriel1 aGarcía-Tenesaca, Marilyn1 aParedes-Moreta, Jonathan1 aNarváez-Narváez, David A1 aRojas-Carrillo, Maira1 aTejera, Eduardo1 aBeltrán-Ayala, Pablo1 aGiampieri, Francesca1 aAlvarez-Suarez, José M.,0 tJournal of apicultural research.g2018 May 27, v. 57, no. 3 p.382-394dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12840x2078-69137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00218839.2018.14263493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03077naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001900146245010100165300001400266520160500280592002801885650002201913650001901935650001201954650001501966650003001981650001902011650001902030650002102049650002902070650000902099650001602108650001002124650001102134650000702145650001702152650001102169650001802180650001602198650001502214653000902229653001802238653001202256653001902268653002602287653001202313653003002325773010302355856008002458852000902538655001202547IND60622264520221121153110.0181124e200801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062226452DNAL7 a10.1177/09596836070855972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoyle, John F.10aClimate and surface water acidity: development and application of a generalized predictive model  ap. 69-81.  aA simple generalized geochemical model is presented that predicts long-term mean lake water acidity from rock type, annual precipitation and temperature, aeolian dust supply and catchment to lake area ratio; all of which can be estimated from mapped data. The model provides a geochemical tool to aid palaeoenvironmental interpretation of diatom inferred lake pH records, and shows how the sensitivity of lake water acidity to climate change varies with the physical and chemical properties of its catchment. Analysis of the model suggests that direct temperature effects on surface water alkalinity are generally minor, while variations in runoff rate caused by changing precipitation or evaporation can have a substantial effect. It is argued that variations in aeolian dust flux are more important than climate in regulating surface water alkalinity in areas of the world subject to above-average dust deposition, an effect that must be taken into account when considering possible direct climate impacts. Applying the model to early Holocene diatom inferred pH records, climatic factors are predicted to be minor compared with the effect of mineral depletion. The model is sensitive to assumptions about dissolved organic carbon production and lake water pCO₂, the two factors that are least well understood. The lack of a quantitative model linking pCO₂ with climate seriously limits our ability to quantify general environmental controls over lake-water pH. These issues require urgent attention if future climate change impacts on surface water acidity and pH are to be predicted reliably.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillariophyceae 3aHolocene epoch 3aacidity 3aalkalinity 3aatmospheric precipitation 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate change 3aclimatic factors 3adissolved organic carbon 3adust 3aevaporation 3alakes 3amodels 3apH 3apaleoecology 3arunoff 3asurface water 3atemperature 3awatersheds 0aLake 0asurface water 0aacidity 0aclimate change 0ageochemical modelling 0aALLOGEN 0adissolved organic carbon.0 tHolocene.g2008 Jan., v. 18, no. 1 p.69-81dSage PublicationswJournal:J000001502x0959-68367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/09596836070855973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04317naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100006800145245013300213300001600346500001900362500002000381520206700401592002802468596004202496596002602538596003202564650001902596650001802615650002002633650001202653650002202665650002902687650001502716650002102731650001502752650001802767650001602785650001902801650001102820650001402831650001202845650001002857650001502867700002402882700005702906700006102963700002303024700001903047700002503066700002103091700001603112700002303128700001703151700002803168700002503196700006003221700001903281700006703300700006203367773012603429856007903555852000903634655001203643IND60688047620221123021253.0200407e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068804762DNAL7 a10.1111/1365-2664.135922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSales, Naiara Guimarães1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2922-356110aFishing for mammals: Landscape‐level monitoring of terrestrial and semi‐aquatic communities using eDNA from riverine systems  ap. 707-716.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aEnvironmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding has revolutionized biomonitoring in both marine and freshwater ecosystems. However, for semi‐aquatic and terrestrial animals, the application of this technique remains relatively untested. We first assess the efficiency of eDNA metabarcoding in detecting semi‐aquatic and terrestrial mammals in natural lotic ecosystems in the UK by comparing sequence data recovered from water and sediment samples to the mammalian communities expected from historical data. Secondly, using occupancy modelling we compared the detection efficiency of eDNA metabarcoding to multiple conventional non‐invasive survey methods (latrine surveys and camera trapping). eDNA metabarcoding detected a large proportion of the expected mammalian community within each area. Common species in the areas were detected at the majority of sites. Several key species of conservation concern in the UK were detected by eDNA sampling in areas where authenticated records do not currently exist, but potential false positives were also identified. Water‐based eDNA metabarcoding provided comparable results to conventional survey methods in per unit of survey effort for three species (water vole, field vole and red deer) using occupancy models. The comparison between survey ‘effort’ to reach a detection probability of ≥.95 revealed that 3–6 water replicates would be equivalent to 3–5 latrine surveys and 5–30 weeks of single camera deployment, depending on the species. Synthesis and applications. eDNA metabarcoding can be used to generate an initial ‘distribution map’ of mammalian diversity at the landscape level. If conducted during times of peak abundance, carefully chosen sampling points along multiple river courses provide a reliable snapshot of the species that are present in a catchment area. In order to fully capture solitary, rare and invasive species, we would currently recommend the use of eDNA metabarcoding alongside other non‐invasive surveying methods (i.e. camera traps) to maximize monitoring efforts.  aPublisher supplied data  aSR17/1214cBritish Ecological Society  cUniversity of Salford  cUniversity of Massachusetts 3aCervus elaphus 3aDNA barcoding 3aapplied ecology 3acameras 3aenvironmental DNA 3aenvironmental monitoring 3afreshwater 3ainvasive species 3alandscapes 3alotic systems 3aprobability 3ariparian areas 3arivers 3asediments 3asurveys 3avoles 3awatersheds1 aMcKenzie, Maisie B.1 aDrake, Joseph1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0458-35331 aHarper, Lynsey R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0923-18011 aBrowett, Samuel S.1 aCoscia, Ilaria1 aWangensteen, Owen S.1 aBaillie, Charles1 aBryce, Emma1 aDawson, Deborah A.1 aOchu, Erinma1 aHänfling, B.q(Bernd),1 aLawson Handley, Lori1 aMariani, Stefano1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5329-05531 aLambin, Xavier1 aSutherland, Christopher1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2073-17511 aMcDevitt, Allan D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2677-78330 tJournal of applied ecology.g2020 Apr., v. 57, no. 4 p.707-716dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl57298x0021-89017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2664.135923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03416naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100005600137245013200193300001600325520213100341592002802472650002002500650000902520650001702529650001202546650001202558650002202570650001402592650002502606650000902631650001302640650002202653650001302675651001402688653002302702653002202725653001802747700001402765700001402779773010802793856007202901852000902973655001202982IND60759933820221121064859.0211216s2021    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075993382DNAL7 a10.1071/WR210042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarchant, R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7387-260914aThe influence of the Southern Oscillation Index on the timing of breeding of a forest-bird community in south-eastern Australia  ap. 730-736.  aContextLong-term changes in the breeding phenology of bird communities have been widely studied. For many species, breeding appears to be starting earlier as temperatures increase. For south-eastern Australia, such a trend has not so far been demonstrated. AimsThe aim was to determine how the date of laying of the first egg (FE; for sedentary species) or arrival times (for migratory species) responded to climatic factors such as rainfall, air temperature and the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI), and whether FE or arrival time showed a trend through time. MethodsThe date of laying of the first egg (FE) for 13 sedentary species of birds was recorded over 18 (1975–1984 and 2007–2014) breeding seasons (August to January) at a single site in a coastal forest in south-eastern Australia. The arrival times for seven migratory species were also recorded for these seasons. Key resultsLinear mixed models showed that FE was negatively correlated with the mean monthly SOI for April to July (A-J SOI), the period directly before the breeding season. Eggs were laid earlier when A-J SOI was positive and later when it was negative. SOIs calculated over different combinations of months showed that those for the January to March period had no influence on FE. FE was not related to minimum or maximum temperatures during April to July, despite increases in temperature between 1975 and 2014, nor was it related to rainfall between April and July. Mixed linear models showed that arrival date for migratory species became earlier between 1975 and 2014, but was uninfluenced by A-J SOI or rainfall. ConclusionsMigratory species arrived earlier by 0.27 days per year. However, this was at least an order of magnitude smaller than annual temporal changes in FE for sedentary species (6–7 days) associated with cyclical SOI fluctuations. Changes in SOI dominated the annual breeding phenology of the community. ImplicationsThe mechanisms by which A-J SOI influences the timing of nesting may be related to the primary productivity of forests and the influence of this on insect abundance. There are few data on these factors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair temperature 3aeggs 3aforest birds 3aforests 3ainsects 3amigratory species 3aphenology 3aprimary productivity 3arain 3aresearch 3asedentary species 3awildlife 3aAustralia 0abreeding phenology 0adate of first egg 0aarrival times1 aGuppy, M.1 aGuppy, S.0 tWildlife research.g2021, v. 48, no. 8 p.730-736dCSIRO PublishingwJournal:jnl3957321x1035-37127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1071/WR210043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02479naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245007200168300001400240520125800254592002801512650001701540650001201557650001301569650002501582650001201607650001201619653002001631653001301651653002101664653003401685653001601719700002401735700006201759700001701821700001801838700001901856773010001875856008501975852000902060655001202069IND60538044820221120121334.0190415e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053804482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoinf.2014.01.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSur, Maitreyi10aChange detection in animal movement using discrete wavelet analysis  ap. 47-57.  aAnimals moving through a complex environment change their movement patterns frequently. Such transitions from one movement behavior to another are a result of multiple factors such as weather, habitat and inter-specific interactions occurring either individually or in tandem. Understanding where and when these changes occur is the first step towards understanding the limiting or key factors acting at different scales.We applied discrete wavelet analysis to find change points in the movement behavior of a Lesser Black-backed gull (Larus fuscus). We compared our results with results from the residence method proposed by Barraquand and Benhamou (2008) and the statistical method proposed by Lavielle (1999, 2005). Discrete wavelet analysis allows the identification and localization of change points by decomposing the frequency content of two time series consisting of step length and residence time data, while omitting the problem of redundancy of coefficients consistent with continuous wavelet transformation of movement data.We show that the novel use of discrete wavelet analysis in animal movement studies is widely applicable on different focus variables, allowing changes in the movement behavior and precise change points to be detected.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLarus fuscus 3aanimals 3ahabitats 3atime series analysis 3awavelet 3aweather 0aAnimal movement 0aWavelets 0aChange detection 0aGeographic Information System 0aData mining1 aSkidmore, Andrew K.1 aExo, Klaus-Michael1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9140-18351 aWang, Tiejun1 aJ.

Dysregulation of apoptosis appears to be associated in the pathogenesis of many human diseases. Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is a common monogenetic disease and is mainly caused by mutations in PKD1. Previous studies proved that increased cell death occurred in ADPKD patients and animal models. However, the role of apoptosis in kidney cystogenesis is not clear.In current study, due to the high similarities between human and pig, PKD1-deficient (PKD1⁺/⁻) pigs and PKD1-knockdown (PKD1ᴷᴰ) pig kidney epithelial cells were used to investigate the mechanisms of apoptosis in driving cystogenesis.In PKD1⁺/⁻ pigs, increased intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis were found at ages of 1 month and 3 months, whereas the autophagy and pyroptosis were not altered. Meanwhile, the intrinsic apoptosis was activated along with untouched extrinsic apoptosis in PKD1ᴷᴰ pig kidney cells. Thus, the intrinsic apoptosis played important roles in cystogenesis.This work provides detail analysis of the roles of different cell death types during cystogenesis in ADPKD pig model. The results suggested a potential new strategy for the diagnosis and treatment of ADPKD by targeting intrinsic apoptosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal models 3aautophagy 3aautosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease 3aepithelium 3agenes 3ahomeostasis 3ahumans 3akidneys 3apathogenesis 3apyroptosis 3aswine 0aADPKD 0aIntrinsic apoptosis 0aPig 0aPKD1 0aADPKD 0aPKD1KD 0aPCD 0aESRD 0aTUNEL1 aLi, Wenya1 aZhang, Suhong1 aSong, Ya1 aDai, Haiting1 aTan, Tan1 aHu, Xiaoxiang1 aHsing, I-Ming,0 tGene.g2021 Sept. 25, v. 798 p.145792-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6378x0378-11197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2021.1457923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02203naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002700145245009500172300001600267520094800283592002801231650002601259650001801285650001301303650001001316650002301326650001901349650001101368650001001379650001301389650001401402650001301416650001101429651001101440651001401451651001701465700002101482700002001503700001601523773014201539856007901681852000901760655001201769IND60312931320221121034212.0150714e20141107xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6031293132DNAL7 a10.1126/science.12562112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhelezinskaia, Iadviga10aLarge sulfur isotope fractionations associated with Neoarchean microbial sulfate reduction  ap. 742-744.  aDissecting ancient microbial sulfur cycling Before the rise of oxygen, life on Earth depended on the marine sulfur cycle. The fractionation of different sulfur isotopes provides clues to which biogeochemical cycles were active long ago (see the Perspective by Ueno). Zhelezinskaia et al. found negative isotope anomalies in Archean rocks from Brazil and posit that metabolic fluxes from sulfate-reducing microorganisms influenced the global sulfur cycle, including sulfur in the atmosphere. In contrast, Paris et al. found positive isotope anomalies in Archean sediments from South Africa, implying that the marine sulfate pool was more disconnected from atmospheric sulfur. As an analog for the Archean ocean, Crowe et al. measured sulfur isotope signatures in modern Lake Matano, Indonesia, and suggest that low seawater sulfate concentrations restricted early microbial activity.

Linear ABC triblock terpolymer poly(di(ethylene glycol)ethyl ether acrylate)-b-poly(N,N-dimethylacrylamide)-b-poly(N-vinylcaprolactam) (PDEGA-b-PDMA-b-PVCL) was synthesized by reversible addition–fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization. The doubly thermal phase transition of PDEGA-b-PDMA-b-PVCL in aqueous solution was investigated by a combination of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), turbidimetry, and dynamic light scattering (DLS). The terpolymer self-assembles into micelles with PDEGA being the core-forming block during the first lower critical solution temperature (LCST) transition corresponding to PDEGA, which is followed by a second LCST transition corresponding to PVCL, resulting in the formation of micellar aggregates. The PDMA middle segment plays an important role as an isolation zone to prevent cooperative dehydration of the PDEGA and PVCL segments, and therefore, two independent LCST transitions corresponding to PDEGA and PVCL were observed. Furthermore, FT-IR with perturbation correlation moving window (PCMW) and two-dimensional spectroscopy (2DCOS) was applied to elucidate the two-step phase transition mechanism of this terpolymer. It was observed that the CH, ester carbonyl, and ether groups of PDEGA change prior to the CH and amide carbonyl groups of PVCL, further supporting that the two phase transitions corresponding to PDEGA and PVCL indeed occur without mutual interferences.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aaqueous solutions 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3aethyl ether 3aethylene glycol 3alight scattering 3amicelles 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aphase transition 3apolymerization 3apolymers 3atemperature 3aturbidimetry1 aLi, Youcheng1 aAn, Zesheng1 aWu, Peiyi0 tLangmuir.g2016 July 05, v. 32, no. 26 p.6691-6700dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.langmuir.6b017853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03004naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003200151245011900183520153800302592002801840650001101868650002501879650001301904650001201917650003001929650002901959650001201988650001302000650002202013650002302035650001102058650002802069650001102097650001702108653002802125653002902153653001902182653002902201653003802230653001602268653002102284700002002305773011402325856008602439852000902525655001202534IND60694088920221120125550.0201025e20200901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069408892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1219732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSavadkoohi, Mohammad Safari10aEnvironmental protection based sustainable development by utilization of granite waste in Reactive Powder Concrete  aStone cutting processes generate waste in large volumes that are often buried and cause polluting the environment. Aside from preventing environmental degradation, using of these wastes for different applications, including in the concrete industry, helps reduce the depletion of mineral resources, offering an excellent opportunity for sustainable development. The present study is an investigation into the use of stone cutting waste in the production of Reactive Powder Concrete (RPC). For this purpose, ninety RPC mix designs, with three water-to-binder ratios (w/B = 0.14, 0.17, and 0.2), three silica-fume-to-binder ratios (SF/B = 0.15, 0.2, and 0.25), two binder (cement + silica fume) contents (1200 and 1500 kg/m³), and five replacement ratios of silica sand by granite waste (GW/Agg = 0, 10, 20, 30, and 40%) were prepared. Superplasticizer content was adjusted in the concrete mixes to achieve a 200 mm spreading diameter in the mini-slump test. Compressive strength, flexural strength, and water absorption tests were conducted on specimens of all concrete mixes. The results were suggestive of improvements in the mechanical properties of the concrete by incorporating up to 30% granite waste in the RPC to the replace silica sand. At GW/Agg = 30%, the compressive and flexural strengths were enhanced by 78 and 60%, while reducing the water absorption of the concrete by 75%. The results also show that by making 1 m³ of RPC with GW/Agg = 30%, 120–300 kg of granite production wastes can be used up.  aPublisher supplied data 3acement 3acompression strength 3aconcrete 3acutting 3aenvironmental degradation 3aenvironmental protection 3agranite 3aindustry 3amineral resources 3amodulus of rupture 3aquartz 3asustainable development 3awastes 3awater uptake 0aSustainable development 0aEnvironmental protection 0aGranite wastes 0aReactive powder concrete 0aCompressive and flexural strength 0aWorkability 0aWater absorption1 aReisi, Mohammad0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2020 Sept. 01, v. 266 p.121973-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1219733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02723naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151242010900171245010200280300001600382520091200398592002801310596013401338596010501472596010701577650001501684650000901699650002501708650001101733650002201744650002201766650001101788650002301799650001201822650001301834651001801847653003801865653001001903653002101913700002301934700001701957700002601974700002302000773012402023856008502147852000902232655001202241IND60694441720221120104027.0200513e20180527xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069444172DNAL7 a10.1080/00218839.2018.14309792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLopes, Mélissa10aImpacto de las tecnologías apícolas tradicionales y modernas en la calidad de la miel de Guinea-Bissau10aImpact of traditional and modern beekeeping technologies on the quality of honey of Guinea-Bissau  ap. 406-417.  aGuinea-Bissau, located on the west coast of Africa, is a country with low human development, where beekeeping and its products can contribute to enrich the nutritional status of population and reduce poverty. The goal of this study was to support the development of beekeeping activities through the quality assessment of local bee products, such as honey, building conditions for commercialization at international markets. This is the first study in Guinean bee products. The botanical origin and chemical composition of honeys produced under traditional and modern beekeeping technologies was evaluated. A clear separation between the two modes of production was found considering the honey quality parameters. Guinean honeys fits the majority of the international standards, allowing its classification as nectar honeys. HMF seems the major handicap, indicating a need to improve processing and storage.  aPublisher supplied data  aEuropeAid/128139/L/ACT/GWcDirectorate-General for Development and Cooperation - EuropeAiddhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100000803  aUID/AGR/00690/2013cFundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologiadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001871  aSFRH/BPD/118987/2016cFundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologiadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001871 3aapiculture 3abees 3achemical composition 3acoasts 3acommercialization 3ahuman development 3anectar 3anutritional status 3apoverty 3aresearch 3aGuinea-Bissau 0atraditional and modern beekeeping 0ahoney 0abotanical origin1 aFalcão, Soraia I.1 aDimou, Maria1 aThrasyvoulou, Andreas1 aVilas-Boas, Miguel0 tJournal of apicultural research.g2018 May 27, v. 57, no. 3 p.406-417dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12840x2078-69137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00218839.2018.14309793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02528naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245009600171520118600267592002801453650001501481650001001496650001501506650002101521650001701542650001201559650000901571650000901580650001601589650002101605650001201626653001201638653001201650653000901662653002801671653002001699653001601719700001901735700001601754700001601770700001501786700001701801700001901818773011401837856008601951852000902037655001202046IND60694089120221122144310.0201025e20200901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069408912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1219772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheng, Xian-Wei10aCaramel product from glucose as a sustainable and effective flame retardant for silk fabric  aThis study aimed at the preparation of caramel product by heating glucose at alkaline condition and its application to develop flame retardant silk fabric. Caramel product was employed to silk through a facile exhaustion approach, and the adsorption property, color depth, flame retardancy and washing durability of caramel on silk fabric were investigated. The adsorption of caramel product on silk at acidic condition imparted brown color and good flame retardancy to silk fabric with self-extinguish ability. The modified silk fabric could still pass the vertical flammability measurement after 15 washing cycles, showing good durability to washing. The bubbling property of caramel during heating is responsible for the enhanced flame retardancy of silk as the formed intumescent char layer could protect silk substrates, revealing a condensed charring mechanism for the modified silk fabric. The caramel product modification exerted little adverse impacts on the handle and tensile strength of silk. The flame retardant modification of silk using eco-friendly and sustainable caramel product is a cleaner production approach compared to the synthetically engineered chemicals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acolor 3adurability 3aflame retardants 3aflammability 3aglucose 3aheat 3asilk 3asilk fabric 3atensile strength 3awashing 0aCaramel 0aGlucose 0aSilk 0aFunctional modification 0aFlame retardant 0aSustainable1 aHuang, Yi-Ting1 aZhang, Chen1 aGu, Wen-Wen1 aMa, Yi-Dan1 aShi, Feng-Yi1 aGuan, Jin-Ping0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2020 Sept. 01, v. 266 p.121977-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1219773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03281naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245011100176300001400287520182400301592002802125650001602153650001802169650001402187650002002201650001202221650002902233650002302262650001302285650001502298650003202313650001302345650002302358653002302381653001602404653002502420653002002445653002402465653002302489653001502512700001702527700002202544773015002566856008602716852000902802655001202811IND60532290520221122050946.0190214e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053229052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anbehav.2015.05.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShafiei Sabet, Saeed14aThe effect of temporal variation in sound exposure on swimming and foraging behaviour of captive zebrafish  ap. 49-60.  aAnthropogenic noise of variable temporal patterns is increasing in both marine and freshwater systems. Aquatic animals often rely on sounds for communication and orientation, which may therefore become more difficult. Predator–prey interactions may be affected by masking of auditory cues, sound-related disturbance or attentional interference. Here, we investigated the impact on both predator and prey for zebrafish, Danio rerio, preying on water fleas, Daphnia magna. We experimentally raised ambient sound levels in an aquarium and tested four sound conditions that varied in temporal pattern: continuous, fast and slow regular intermittent and irregular intermittent, which we compared with ambient sound levels with no extra exposure. We found no effects on water flea swimming speed or depth but there was an increasing number of individual zebrafish with an increased number of startle responses, especially to the intermittent sound treatments, which was also reflected in a significant increase in zebrafish swimming speed, but not in any change in zebrafish swimming depth. Discrimination in attacking edible water fleas or inedible duckweed particles was low for the zebrafish and unaffected by sound exposure, but foraging was affected in two ways: intermittent sounds delayed the initial acceleration response and all treatments caused a rise in handling error. These insights confirm that elevated sound levels, and especially intermittent conditions, may affect predator–prey interactions. Our results apply to laboratory conditions but call for outdoor studies that go beyond single-species effects. If acoustic impact of human activities extends to multiple species and their interactions, natural sound conditions may turn out to be important for the stability and dynamics of aquatic ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDanio rerio 3aDaphnia magna 3aacoustics 3aanimal behavior 3aanimals 3aanthropogenic activities 3aaquatic ecosystems 3aforaging 3afreshwater 3apredator-prey relationships 3aswimming 3atemporal variation 0abehavioural impact 0aDanio rerio 0aforaging performance 0asound pollution 0aspecies interaction 0aswimming behaviour 0awater flea1 aNeo, Yik Yaw1 aSlabbekoorn, Hans0 tAnimal behaviour.g2015 Sept., v. 107 p.49-60dElsevier LtdaThe Association for the Study of Animal BehaviourwJournal:jnl45841x0003-34727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2015.05.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04229naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100003000149245009700179506010400276506007600380520256300456592002803019506003703047650002403084650002103108650001003129650001003139650001903149650001303168650002103181650002003202650001503222653002403237653002203261653002503283653001803308653000803326653000803334653000903342653001203351653000803363700002103371700002603392700001903418700002703437700001703464700001903481773010603500856008403606852000903690655001203699IND60776707920221207091140.0220606e20220715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077670792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jprot.2022.1046012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVasilogianni, Areti-Maria10aProteomic quantification of perturbation to pharmacokinetic target proteins in liver disease  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aModel-based assessment of drug pharmacokinetics in liver disease requires quantification of abundance and disease-related changes in hepatic enzymes and transporters. This study aimed to assess performance of three label-free methods [high N (HiN), intensity-based absolute quantification (iBAQ) and total protein approach (TPA)] against QconCAT-based targeted data in healthy and diseased (cancer and cirrhosis) liver tissue. Measurements were compared across methods and disease-to-control ratios provided a ‘disease perturbation factor’ (DPF) for each protein. Mean label-free measurements of targets correlated well (Pearson's coefficient, r = 0.91–0.98 p < 0.001) and with targeted data (r = 0.65–0.95, p < 0.001). Concordance with targeted data was generally moderate (Lin's concordance coefficient, ρc = 0.46–0.92), depending on methodology. Moderate precision and accuracy were observed for label-free methods (average fold error, AFE = 1.44–1.68; absolute average fold error, AAFE = 2.44–3.23). The DPF reconciled the data and indicated downregulated expression in cancer and cirrhosis, consistent with an inflammatory effect. HiN estimated perturbation consistently with targeted data (AFEHᵢN = 1.07, AAFEHᵢN = 1.57), whereas iBAQ overestimated (AFEᵢBAQ = 0.81, AAFEᵢBAQ = 1.67) and TPA underestimated (AFETPA = 1.37, AAFETPA = 1.65) disease effect. Progression from mild to severe cirrhosis was consistent with progressive decline in expression, reproduced by HiN but overestimated by iBAQ and underestimated by TPA (AFEHᵢN = 0.98, AFEᵢBAQ = 0.60, AFETPA = 1.24). DPF data confirmed non-uniform disease effect on drug-elimination pathways and progressive impact of disease severity. This study demonstrated good correlation and moderate concordance between intensity-based label-free proteomic methods (HiN, iBAQ and TPA) and targeted data. Label-free measurements tended to overestimate abundance, but differences were reconciled using a disease perturbation factor (DPF) for each protein. With targeted data as a reference, HiN defined disease perturbation and the impact of disease progression consistently, indicating that the use of ‘razor’ peptides for quantification against an exogenous standard provides biologically sensible quantitative fingerprints of disease. Disease-driven perturbations in expression relative to healthy baseline are incorporated into drug kinetic models used to predict drug exposure in disease populations where clinical studies may not be feasible.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3adisease progression 3adisease severity 3adrugs 3aliver 3aliver diseases 3apeptides 3apharmacokinetics 3aprotein content 3aproteomics 0aTargeted proteomics 0aGlobal proteomics 0aDisease perturbation 0aLiver disease 0aDPF 0aHiN 0aiBAQ 0aQconCAT 0aTPA1 aEl-Khateeb, Eman1 aAl-Majdoub, Zubida M.1 aAlrubia, Sarah1 aRostami-Hodjegan, Amin1 aBarber, Jill1 aAchour, Brahim0 tJournal of proteomics.g2022 July 15, v. 263 p.104601-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12134x1874-39197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jprot.2022.1046013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02060naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245014500162300001600307520089200323592002801215650001201243650001601255650002101271650002301292650001301315653002501328653003701353653002401390653002201414700002601436700002001462700002401482773010101506856008201607852000901689655001201698IND60625773220221123014946.0190131e20190118xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062577322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2018.11.0622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKo, Firyon10aMolecular structure of 9,10-bis[bis(4-tert-butylphenyl)methylene)-9,10-dihydroanthracene: A butterfly-shaped Thiele's hydrocarbon derivative  ap. 357-362.  aThe molecular structure of 9,10-bis[bis(4-tert-butylphenyl)methylene)-9,10-dihydroanthracene, an anthraquinodimethane derivative having four aryl groups on exocyclic methylene positions, was experimentally and theoretically characterized. Single-crystal diffraction study revealed that the title molecule takes a butterfly shape, i.e., two exocyclic carbons rise from the molecular plane, defined by four carbons of central quinoidal ring, by 1.257(3) Å (average). The dihedral angle of the butterfly wing, i.e., the angle between the two annulated benzenes is 137.71(5)°. Characteristic bond alternation was observed for the central quinoidal moiety and the exocyclic double bond. Theoretical study indicated that this butterfly shape is the stable structure.

Very rapid extraction of furfural, aided by fast mass transfer rates, is key to preventing furfural subsequent degradation. Thus, by operating at elevated temperatures (i.e., 150–190 °C), it is possible to maintain high furfural selectivity (ca. 70%) at high xylose conversion (ca. 80%) and very short residence times (up to 2.5 min). A reaction mechanism is proposed based on the observed conversion-selectivity trends, and on the analysis of product distribution. The contribution of humins to the carbon balance is remarkably low due to the high furfural extraction rates achieved in the millireactor. Through first-principle reactor modeling, we further demonstrate the potential of combining intensified reactor technologies with the extractive synthesis of furfural and show that solvent optimization will be crucial to boost furfural selectivity above 80%.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3afurfural 3amass transfer 3amodels 3aprocess design 3areaction mechanisms 3asolvents 3atemperature 3axylose1 aKleijwegt, Roel J.

Its relationships with other families are unclear, although recent molecular analyses suggest affinities with Linaceae, Caryocaraceae, Erythroxylaceae, and Rhizophoraceae. To gain insight into family relationships, we investigated 63 embryological characters of two previously unstudied African species, Irvingia gabonensis and I. smithii, and compared them with other Malpighiales and the sister group Oxalidales. Embryologically, Irvingia is characterized by the absence of an integumentary tapetum and by having a non-multiplicative inner integument, a multiplicative testa, many discrete fascicles of vascular bundles running in the testa from the raphe to antiraphe (each fascicle comprised several strands arranged in a concentric manner), and a fibrous exotegmen. Comparisons showed that Irvingia did not resemble any of the Linaceae, Caryocaraceae, Erythroxylaceae, Rhizophoraceae, or any of the other malpighialean families for which embryological data are available. The genus rather resembled Huaceae and Connaraceae (Oxalidales) in seed coat structure. However, 18 families (45%) of the Malpighiales are still poorly understood embryologically, and therefore additional studies are required for further critical comparisons.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCaryocaraceae 3aConnaraceae 3aErythroxylaceae 3aHuaceae 3aIrvingia gabonensis 3aLinaceae 3aRhizophoraceae 3aembryo (plant) 3aembryology 3atesta 3avascular bundles 2aMagnoliopsidaxclassificationxembryologyxultrastructure. 2aFlowersxembryologyxultrastructure. 2aOvulexembryologyxultrastructure. 2aPhylogeny 2aPollenxembryologyxultrastructure. 2aSeedsxembryologyxultrastructure. 0aCentral African Republic 0aNigeria1 aRaven, Peter H.0 tJournal of plant research.g2011 Sept., v. 124, no. 5 p.577-591dSpringer-Verlagx0918-94407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10265-010-0393-7  aDNAL 7aarticle02788naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245008400173300001600257520158200273592002801855650003001883650001101913650001401924650001301938650002201951650002301973650001101996650001102007650002502018650001702043650001102060650001502071650001002086650002502096650001302121650001002134651001102144700001602155773009302171856008102264852000902345655001202354IND60123884020221119135450.0150411e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012388402DNAL7 a10.1007/s10144-014-0466-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrzybowski, Mirosław10aVariations in the population structure and ecology of Matteuccia struthiopteris  ap. 127-141.  aThe aim of the study was to investigate variation in the structure of a population of Matteuccia struthiopteris (L.) Tod. in N–E Poland depending on its location in a river valley and light availability under tree canopies. Ordination statistical methods and structural equation modeling were used to identify ecological relationships in the population. The analysis showed that optimum growth conditions of M. struthiopteris depend on the canopy cover. As the shading increased, the size of trophophyllous leaves and the production of sporophylls decreased. The relationship between the canopy cover and the optimum growth conditions was best expressed by rootstock diameter and, to a lesser extent, by the number and height of trophophylls. An indirect relationship between the number and height of sporophylls and the canopy cover, by rootstock size and trophophyll quantity, was also identified. This relationship may be caused by the predominance of vegetative forms of reproduction. Based on the correlations between the landscape position vs. rootstock diameter and trophophyll height, a difference in the habitat colonization potential of M. struthiopteris could be detected. Three spatial clusters of M. struthiopteris in the river valley were identified: river bank, river terrace, river valley slopes. These relationships and the distribution of other herbaceous plant species occurring at the plots indicate that the distribution pattern of M. struthiopteris in the study area is determined by diverse environmental conditions, however mainly by light conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMatteuccia struthiopteris 3acanopy 3aequations 3ahabitats 3aherbaceous plants 3alandscape position 3aleaves 3amodels 3apopulation structure 3areproduction 3arivers 3arootstocks 3ashade 3astatistical analysis 3aterraces 3atrees 3aPoland1 aKruk, Marek0 tPopulation ecology.g2015 Jan., v. 57, no. 1 p.127-141dSpringer-Verlagx1438-38967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10144-014-0466-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02372naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024002200117024001900139040001800158100002200176245012400198300001500322520091300337592002801250650001101278650001901289650001701308650001101325650001201336650001501348650001901363650002501382650001201407650001701419650001001436700002401446700001901470700002301489700002201512700002201534773015201556856006901708856010501777990002301882852000901905655001201914IND60643558220221121201322.0190511e20140906xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064355822DNAL7 a10.3791/516822doi7 aPMC48280552pmcid7 a252258172pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPreble, Janine M.10aRapid isolation and purification of mitochondria for transplantation by tissue dissociation and differential filtration  ap. e51682.  aPreviously described mitochondrial isolation methods using differential centrifugation and/or Ficoll gradient centrifugation require 60 to 100 min to complete. We describe a method for the rapid isolation of mitochondria from mammalian biopsies using a commercial tissue dissociator and differential filtration. In this protocol, manual homogenization is replaced with the tissue dissociator’s standardized homogenization cycle. This allows for uniform and consistent homogenization of tissue that is not easily achieved with manual homogenization. Following tissue dissociation, the homogenate is filtered through nylon mesh filters, which eliminate repetitive centrifugation steps. As a result, mitochondrial isolation can be performed in less than 30 min. This isolation protocol yields approximately 2 x 1010 viable and respiration competent mitochondria from 0.18 ± 0.04 g (wet weight) tissue sample.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiopsy 3acentrifugation 3adissociation 3aficoll 3afilters 3afiltration 3ahomogenization 3aisolation techniques 3amammals 3amitochondria 3anylon1 aPacak, Christina A.1 aKondo, Hiroshi1 aMacKay, Allison A.1 aCowan, Douglas B.1 aMcCully, James D.0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2014 Sept. 06, , no. 91 p.e51682-e51682dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/516823Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/51682/rapid-isolation-purification-mitochondria-for-transplantation-tissue  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03483naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001600153245013400169520162100303592002801924650001601952650001101968650001301979650001401992650002602006650002202032650001202054650000902066650003302075650002002108650001002128650001102138650001902149650000902168650002402177650001402201650001002215650001802225650001102243650001102254650001502265650001202280650001402292650001402306650001102320650001702331650002202348650002002370651001202390653003302402653002002435653001902455653002602474653002802500700001802528700002102546700002002567700001802587773011902605856008802724852000902812655001202821IND60655263320221119194047.0191121e20191201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065526332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.07.2772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIrob, Katja10aPotash mining effluents induce moderate effects on histopathological and physiological endpoints of adult zebrafish (Danio rerio)  aStress in fish can be caused by a variety of factors and has the potential to evoke stress responses leading to a reduction of physical condition and of health. The river Werra (Germany) presents a severe case of secondary salinisation caused by potash mining activities. The model organism Danio rerio was exposed to different ion-concentrations depicting current (HT) and future (LT) threshold values of the Werra, as well as to solutions with single-exceeding ions (Mg2+ + K+ (KMg), Mg2+ (Mg) and K+ (K)). After a six-week exposure period, cortisol levels, growth and weight were measured, gills and gonads were histologically analysed and mRNA expression of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinising hormone (LH), growth hormone (GH) and prolactin (PRL) were determined. Cortisol was still elevated in fish in the HT and K group, indicating moderate stress. However, gills revealed structural changes in zebrafish in all exposure groups, size of oocytes differed in the LT and K group, male FSH mRNA levels were elevated in the HT and LT group whereas PRL mRNA levels were lower in HT and LT for both, male and female fish.These results suggest that ion-stress induces moderate effects on a variety of biological parameters that mainly serve to adapt to elevated ion concentrations. For these reasons current and even future thresholds should be reconsidered, including thresholds for total as well as single ion concentrations. Future research looking at the effects on local fish species is needed, along with regular and long-term monitoring of environmental conditions, species abundance and diversity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDanio rerio 3aadults 3acortisol 3aeffluents 3aenvironmental factors 3aexposure duration 3afemales 3afish 3afollicle-stimulating hormone 3agene expression 3agills 3agonads 3ahistopathology 3aions 3aluteinizing hormone 3amagnesium 3amales 3amessenger RNA 3amining 3amodels 3amonitoring 3aoocytes 3apotassium 3aprolactin 3arivers 3asomatotropin 3aspecies abundance 3astress response 3aGermany 0aSecondary river salinisation 0aFreshwater fish 0aIon imbalances 0aOsmoregulatory stress 0aPotash mining effluents1 aWagler, Marit1 aBaberschke, Nora1 aMeinelt, Thomas1 aKloas, Werner0 tScience of the total environment.g2019 Dec. 01, v. 694 p.133471-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.07.2773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02417naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002100137245010300158300001600261520136400277592002801641650001301669650001501682650001101697650002101708650001501729650003001744650001301774650001001787650001301797650002101810650001901831651001501850773011001865856007101975852000902046655001202055IND60518279420221122220956.0160411e198002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051827942DNAL7 a10.2307/19424802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLarson, Ralph J.10aCompetition, Habitat Selection, and the Bathymetric Segregation of Two Rockfish (Sebastes) Species  ap. 221-239.  aSebastes carnatus and Sebastes chrysomelas are morphologically and ecologically similar residents of rocky reefs off the coast of California. They segregate bathymetrically, with S. chrysomelas occurring shallower than S. carnatus. Each species extended its depth distribution where its congener was removed, and no distributional changes occurred in a control area. Thus both species tolerated conditions beyond their normal depth ranges, and were limited in part of their normal depth ranges by interspecific competition. Their segregation was apparently initiated by the preferential settlement of young fish from the plankton, S. chrysomelas in shallow water and S. carnatus deeper. Their segregation was maintained by interspecific territoriality. The distribution of S. chrysomelas, the socially dominant species, may also have been affected by a strong preference for food—rich areas that occurred mainly in shallow water. I postulate that such a preference would be due to the advantage of smaller home ranges in shallow water, where strong wave surge makes the shelter hole a more important part of a fish's territory. This postulated preference, along with aggression from S. carnatus, limited S. chrysomelas to shallow water. Because of its social dominance, S. chrysomelas aggressively excluded S. carnatus from preferred areas in shallow water.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSebastes 3aaggression 3acoasts 3adominant species 3ahome range 3ainterspecific competition 3aplankton 3areefs 3arockfish 3asocial dominance 3aterritoriality 3aCalifornia0 tEcological monographs.g1980 Feb., v. 50, no. 2 p.221-239dEcological Society of Americax0012-96157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2307/19424803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02931naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245016000167300001600327520149700343592002801840650002201868650001901890650002301909650001201932650001601944650001001960650001901970650001001989650002201999650001502021650002102036650002102057650001402078650003502092700002102127700002002148700002002168700001902188700001702207700002102224700002102245773010502266856008102371852000902452655001202461IND60119874320221120170505.0150118e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011987432DNAL7 a10.1007/s12272-014-0348-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Jeong-Hyun10aDirect sequencing and comprehensive screening of genetic polymorphisms on CYP2 family genes (CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, and CYP2E1) in five ethnic populations  ap. 115-128.  aRecently, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, and CYP2E1 have been reported to play a role in the metabolic effect of pharmacological and carcinogenic compounds. Moreover, genetic variations of drug metabolism genes have been implicated in the interindividual variation in drug disposition and pharmacological response. To define the distribution of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in these four CYP2 family genes and to discover novel SNPs across ethnic groups, 288 DNAs composed of 48 African-Americans, 48 European-Americans, 48 Japanese, 48 Han Chinese, and 96 Koreans were resequenced. A total of 143 SNPs, 26 in CYP2A6, 45 in CYP2B6, 29 in CYP2C8, and 43 in CYP2E1, were identified, including 13 novel variants. Notably, two SNPs in the regulatory regions, a promoter SNP rs2054675 and a nonsynonymous rs3745274 (p.172Q>H) in CYP2B6, showed significantly different minor allele frequencies (MAFs) among ethnic groups (minimum P = 4.30 × 10⁻¹²). In addition, rs2031920 in the promoter region of CYP2E1 showed a wide range of MAF between different ethnic groups, and even among other various ethnic groups based on public reports. Among 13 newly discovered SNPs in this study, 5 SNPs were estimated to have potential functions in further in silico analyses. Some differences in genetic variations and haplotypes of CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, and CYP2E1 were observed among populations. Our findings could be useful in further researches, such as genetic associations with drug responses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAfrican Americans 3aChinese people 3aEuropean Americans 3aKoreans 3acarcinogens 3adrugs 3agene frequency 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3ahaplotypes 3apharmacokinetics 3apromoter regions 3ascreening 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism1 aCheong, Hyun Sub1 aPark, Byung Lae1 aKim, Lyoung Hyo1 aShin, Hee Jung1 aNa, Han Sung1 aChung, Myeon Woo1 aShin, Hyoung Doo0 tArchives of pharmacal research.g2015 Jan., v. 38, no. 1 p.115-128dSpringer-Verlagx0253-62697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12272-014-0348-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05253naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002400137245016100161300001600322520373000338592002804068650002204096650002204118650001104140650002404151650001404175650002104189650001104210650001704221650002404238650001404262650001404276650001204290650002004302650001404322650001704336650001604353650001004369650001504379650002504394650002004419650002304439650000904462650002104471650001204492650000904504700002004513773011004533856007104643852000904714655001204723IND60518279520221122220933.0160411e198002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051827952DNAL7 a10.2307/19424792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcClure, Polley Ann10aRelative Allocation of Energy to Growth and Development of Homeothermy in the Eastern Wood Rat (Neotoma floridana) and Hispid Cotton Rat (Sigmodon hispidus)  ap. 199-219.  aAllocation of energy to growth and heat production was measured by constructing energy budgets of male and female Sigmodon hispidus (x Adult body mass = ABM = 113 g ♂ 105 g ♀) and Neotoma floridana (ABM = 270 g ♂ 184 g ♀) from birth to maturity. Energy ingested and oxygen consumption per gram of body mass of post—weaning animals were not significantly different between sexes within species, but did differ significantly between the species. In all animals the relation between post—weaning ingestion (per gram body mass) and body mass follows a negative power function. Post—weaning metabolic rate as a function of body mass follows a different negative power function. The pattern of change in metabolic rate prior to weaning is different in the two species. In Sigmodon, metabolic rate increases linearly from birth to about 20 g (or about 20% of ABM). The rate at 20 g is about 5 cm³°g— ¹°h— ¹. In Neotoma metabolic rate remains constant at 1.7 cm³°g— ¹°h— ¹ from birth to about 26 g (or about 11% of ABM), then increases linearly to about 2.2 cm³°g— ¹°h— ¹ at 65 g (29% ABM). In both species, the peak in metabolic rate and nutritional weaning coincide with development of homeothermy, (measured as ability to maintain adult—level body temperatures at an ambient temperature of 20°C). Young Sigmodon become efficient homeotherms by 10—12 d of age whereas Neotoma require 19—22 d. Growth of each sex and species can be described by Gompertz equations. Growth rate constants, K, and asymptotic mass, A, differ between sexes within species and between species. Gompertz equations do not accurately describe growth of pre—weaning Neotoma which was linear from birth to 21—22 d of age. No such period of linearity is seen in Sigmodon growth. Analysis of litter—size dependence of growth of pre—weaning animals indicates that the early linear growth of Neotoma may not be a result of limited milk production, as it seems to be in Sigmodon. The relative total investment of energy in growth for a litter of Sigmodon (° = 4.8 young) between birth and 12 d of age was 416.7 kJ compared to 770.7 kJ for the first 24 d of life of the average Neotoma (x = 2.6 young). Over these same times, a litter of Sigmodon expended 1350.6 kJ on respiration compared with 1296.2 kJ in Neotoma. Thus the total metabolizable energy requirements of 1767.7 kJ and 2066.2 kJ are similar in the two species; however, a litter of Sigmodon requires about twice as much metabolizable energy per day each day they remain with their mother. Neotoma daily requirements are lower but protracted in time. During the pre—weaning period, Neotoma are investing proportionally more of their metabolizable energy in growth, whereas Sigmodon spend more on respiration, perhaps because they depend on their own heat production for thermoregulation while Neotoma rely on their mother's heat. These results are compared with data from the literature on growth and development of homothermy in a variety of small rodents. The hypothesis is advanced that, in general, larger species defer onset of active thermoregulation to larger body masses when lower metabolic rates occur, perhaps as an adaptation to permit more efficient early growth. Small species sacrifice growth efficiency in favor of rapid attainment of early independence and they pay the high energy costs of that speed. The different developmental physiologies of Neotoma and Sigmodon are explainable by inference from current ideas on the evolution of life histories, but much of the difference is also predictable simply from their difference in body size. This may indicate the importance of body size in the complex of life history traits.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNeotoma floridana 3aSigmodon hispidus 3aadults 3aambient temperature 3abody size 3abody temperature 3aenergy 3aenergy costs 3aenergy requirements 3aequations 3aevolution 3afemales 3aheat production 3aingestion 3alife history 3alitter size 3amales 3ametabolism 3ametabolizable energy 3amilk production 3aoxygen consumption 3arats 3athermoregulation 3aweaning 3awood1 aRandolph, J.

Additionally, the cyclization products could be readily subjected to several transformations for elaborating synthetic utilities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkynes 3acarbon 3achemical reactions 3achemical structure 3aenantioselectivity 3aregioselectivity 0aCopper catalysis 0a1,6-Enynes 0aSilylative cyclization 0acis-Hydrobenzofuran1 aXie, Li-Bo1 aDing, Rui1 aTian, Ping1 aLin, Guo-Qiang0 tTetrahedron.g2019 Mar. 22, v. 75, no. 12 p.1682-1688dElsevier LtdwJournal:11744x0040-40207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tet.2018.12.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02601naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245009600167300001400263520127000277592002801547650001901575650002101594650002501615650002701640650001701667650003801684650001001722650001601732650001201748650002601760650001101786650001801797650001501815650001301830650003301843650001601876700001701892700002401909700002901933773010301962856008102065852000902146655001202155IND60119874520221120143927.0150118e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011987452DNAL7 a10.1007/s12272-014-0355-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMahammed, Nawaz10aDesign of phosphated cross-linked microspheres of bael fruit gum as a biodegradable carrier  ap. 42-51.  aPresent work was aimed at designing of phosphated cross-linked microspheres of bael fruit gum (BFG) by emulsification method using sodium-tri-meta phosphate as a cross-linking agent for treatment of colon cancer using 5-fluorouracil as model drug. Stirring speed was found to be 1,000 rpm for about 5 h to be optimal to obtain reproducible microspheres. It was found that there is an increase in particle size as polymer concentration is increased whereas a reduction in particle size was observed as there is increase in stirring speed. Cross-linked BFG microspheres were successfully prepared by emulsification method. Optimum surfactant concentration was found to be 2 % w/w. Scanning electron microscopy studies showed that the drug-loaded microspheres were non-aggregated and in spherical shape. Differential scanning calorimetry and Fourier transform infrared-spectroscopy studies showed that drug and excipients are compatible. Release studies showed that drug release was more profound in cecal medium induced with enzymes causing degradation of the cross linked BFG than that of the release showed in simulated intestinal fluid. Stability studies showed that there were no significant changes in the drug content and physical appearance of microspheres.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAegle marmelos 3abiodegradability 3acolorectal neoplasms 3across-linking reagents 3acrosslinking 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3adrugs 3aemulsifying 3aenzymes 3ainfrared spectroscopy 3amixing 3aparticle size 3aplant gums 3apolymers 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asurfactants1 aGowda, D.

It is a major public health problem in Latin America, as six to seven million people are infected, being the principal cause of mortality in many endemic regions. Moreover, Chagas disease has become widespread due to migrant populations. Additionally, there are no vaccines nor effective treatments to fight the disease because of its long-term nature and complex pathology. Therefore, these facts emphasize how crucial the international effort for the development of new treatments against Chagas disease is. Here, we present the in vitro and in vivo trypanocidal activity of some oxygenated abietane diterpenoids and related compounds. The 1,4-benzoquinone 15, not yet reported, was identified as a fast-acting trypanocidal drug with efficacy against different strains in vitro and higher activity and lower toxicity than benznidazole in both phases of murine Chagas disease. The mode of action was also evaluated, suggesting that quinone 15 kills T. cruzi by inducing mitochondrion-dependent necrosis through a bioenergetics collapse caused by a mitochondrial membrane depolarization and iron-containing superoxide dismutase inhibition. Therefore, the abietane 1,4-benzoquinone 15 can be considered as a new candidate molecule for the development of an appropriate and commercially accessible anti-Chagas drug.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChagas disease 3aTrypanosoma cruzi 3abenznidazole 3abiological assessment 3aditerpenoids 3aenergy metabolism 3amechanism of action 3amice 3amitochondrial membrane 3amortality 3anecrosis 3aparasites 3apeople 3apublic health 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atoxicity 3atrypanocides 3aLatin America1 aGuardia, Juan J.1 aMartín-Escolano, Javier1 aCirauqui, Nuria1 aFernández, Antonio,1 aRosales, Maria J.1 aChahboun, Rachid1 aSánchez-Moreno, Manuel,1 aAlvarez-Manzaneda, Enrique1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3659-44751 aMarín, Clotilde1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4316-27420 tJournal of natural products.g2020 Nov. 30, v. 83, no. 12 p.3571-3583dAmerican Chemical Society and American Society of PharmacognosywJournal:jnl11422x1520-60257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jnatprod.0c006513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02485naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001800143245012100161300001600282520111800298592002801416650001901444650001601463650002001479650002201499650001701521650002701538650002501565650001301590651001201603651001001615651001701625651001601642653001801658653002201676653002001698653002801718700002201746700002101768700002001789700002001809773008701829856007701916961001301993852000902006655001202015IND60518119020221117111900.0160406e20130712xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051811902DNAL7 a10.1139/gen-2013-00272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJun, Tae-Hwan10aPopulation genetic structure and genetic diversity of soybean aphid collections from the USA, South Korea, and Japan  ap. 345-350.  aFollowing its recent invasion of North America, the soybean aphid (Aphis glycines Matsumura) has become the number one insect pest of soybean (Glycine max L. Merr.) in the north central states of the USA. A few studies have been conducted on the population genetic structure and genetic diversity of the soybean aphid and the source of its invasion in North America. Molecular markers, such as simple sequence repeats (SSRs) are very useful in the evaluation of population structure and genetic diversity. We used 18 SSR markers to assess the genetic diversity of soybean aphid collections from the USA, South Korea, and Japan. The aphids were collected from two sites in the USA (Indiana and South Dakota), two sites in South Korea (Yeonggwang district and Cheonan city), and one site in Japan (Utsunomiya). The SSR markers were highly effective in differentiating among aphid collections from different countries. The level of differentiation within each population and among populations from the same country was limited, even in the case of the USA where the two collection sites were more than 1200 km apart.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAphis glycines 3aGlycine max 3agenetic markers 3agenetic variation 3ainsect pests 3amicrosatellite repeats 3apopulation structure 3asoybeans 3aIndiana 3aJapan 3aSouth Dakota 3aSouth Korea 0asoybean aphid 0agenetic diversity 0adifferentiation 0asimple sequence repeats1 aMichel, Andrew P.1 aWenger, Jacob A.1 aKang, Sung-Taeg1 aMian, M.A. Rouf0 tGenome.g2013 July 12, v. 56, no. 6 p.345-350dNRC Research Pressx1480-33217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/gen-2013-00273Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle05837naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001900137245008500156300001600241520460200257592002804859650002704887650001004914650001604924650001504940650000904955650003104964650002704995650001505022650002205037650001305059650001505072650003305087650001905120650002205139650002105161650001905182700002405201773011005225856007105335852000905406655001205415IND60518279820221122221108.0160411e198002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051827982DNAL7 a10.2307/29372532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWiens, John A.10aPatterns of Morphology and Ecology in Grassland and Shrubsteppe Bird Populations  ap. 287-308.  aWe analyze patterns of morphological variation in a guild of 12 species of grassland/shrubsteppe birds in relation to various theories expressing ecomorphological correlations. Variability in morphology over the six geographic locations sampled was moderate for most species, but several morphological traits exhibited significant variation between years at given locations. Sexual variation (dimorphism) was significant for most traits in most species; it was most apparent in polygynously mating forms, but occurred as well in several monogamous species. Dimorphism was generally greater for traits related in a general way to body size than for bill size traits, suggesting a stronger role for sexual selection than for intersexual trophic niche differentiation in driving dimorphism in these species. In nonsexual dimensions of variation, variability in bill features and body measurements tended to be similar. Migratory species did not differ from resident species in the degree of morphological variability. There was heterogeneity as well in the patterns of covariation among morphological traits. Principal component analysis indicated different clusterings or "suites" of morphological traits in component space for the different species, although in several the first principal component appeared to represent a general "body size" set. In these species there was thus substantial morphological variation that occurred in no readily discernible patterns in space or time, suggesting that simple characterizations of the morphology of these species from museum specimens or from literature values are at best only general approximations, and may be inappropriate for testing ecomorphological theories at the level of local populations and communities. An analysis of relations between morphology and diet revealed few clear associations in the directions predicted by theory within species populations. Bill size and prey size in individual birds were generally uncorrelated, and the few correlations between prey size and suites of covarying morphological traits were quite weak. Variability in bill dimensions was unrelated to dietary diversity or variety; populations in which bill sizes were more variable did not consume more variable—sized prey than less variable populations of a species. Similarly, there was no relationship between sexual dimorphism and diet variety. Between species, on the other hand, there were significant relationships between body length or bill length and prey size. Principal component analysis revealed that over the entire assemblage of species considered, bigger species had bigger bills and larger territories; they tended to eat bigger things that were more variable in size, and they were primarily carnivorous. The sizes of birds in this assemblage were distributed in a discontinuous fashion, however, with a gap in the body size spectrum between 30—40 g species and those weighing over 100 g. Removal of the large species from the morphology—diet analysis destroyed the clear patterns. The agreements with theoretical predictions thus hold only at a general level, but do not appear when the several small (10—40 g) species are considered as a group. Examination of the frequency distributions of prey sizes taken by coexisting guild members at several locations revealed a wide array of patterns, ranging from orderly size—related separations or rankings through complete overlap in prey size distributions to inversions, in which small—sized species consumed larger prey than large—sized species. It is apparent that any predictions of dietary characteristics from morphology are tenuous indeed. Body size was significantly related to territory size over the entire spectrum of bird species, but there was substantial variation in territory sizes within any given species, and the relationship did not obtain within the set of small species. Variations in abundance of populations were not associated with changes in the variation of morphological traits; more abundant populations were not necessarily more variable. Overall, our analysis casts doubt on the applicability of much current ecomorphological theory to the bird guilds we studied. We believe that close associations between morphology and ecology are obscured by the substantial variability in both. This variability may reflect the fluctuating selection pressures characteristic of arid and semiarid environments, where environmental stresses (and the attendant tight restriction of population variation in morphology and ecology) are sporadic in their occurrence.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGeographical Locations 3abirds 3abody length 3acarnivores 3adiet 3aecological differentiation 3afrequency distribution 3agrasslands 3amigratory species 3amonogamy 3aprediction 3aprincipal component analysis 3asemiarid zones 3asexual dimorphism 3asexual selection 3aterritoriality1 aRotenberry, John T.0 tEcological monographs.g1980 Feb., v. 50, no. 3 p.287-308dEcological Society of Americax0012-96157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2307/29372533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01728naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245009800164300001600262520073300278592002801011650001801039650002101057650002001078650001901098650001101117700002201128700002701150700002001177773012701197856008101324852000901405655001201414IND4469494320221117002652.0141112e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446949432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2011.12.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPlate, Sabrina10aDetermination of the degree of substitution of hydrolysed octenylsuccinate-derivatised starch  ap. 580-582.  aAim of the present study was to compare two methods for the determination of the degree of substitution of starch esterified with octenyl succinic anhydride (OSA).

An interference with reducing sugars was hypothesized as possible reason and confirmed by control experiments using different reducing and non reducing low molecular weight carbohydrates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidification 3amolecular weight 3areducing sugars 3asaponification 3astarch1 aDiekmann, Sabrina1 aSteinhÃ¤user, Ulrike1 aDrusch, Stephan0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2012 May, v. 46, no. 2 p.580-582dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2011.12.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02342naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245014700173300001600320520124400336592002801580650001901608650001701627650000901644650001601653650001401669650000901683650001601692650001101708650001501719650001001734651001401744700002601758700001801784773007301802856008401875852000901959655001201968IND60096569420221117225031.0141104e20131101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009656942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2013.08.0452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGibson, Chanel Ann10aOptimisation and selection of a steam turbine for a large scale industrial CHP (combined heat and power) system under Australia's carbon price  ap. 291-307.  aThis paper describes an investigation in the optimisation of a steam turbine CHP (combined heat and power) system under three economic cases resulting from the introduction of a carbon price in Australia: no carbon price (case one); carbon price and not liable (case two); and a carbon price and liable (case three). A case study was considered for validation purposes. Steam turbine partial load equations and required pricing data under the various cases were derived. For this coal boiler steam turbine CHP system, the most economical situation was case two, and the least economical situation was case three. These results indicate the introduction of the carbon price has made the installation of these types of systems more attractive in terms of economic benefits as long as the system is not liable. All scenarios proved uneconomical with a natural gas boiler. The high price of fuel compared to the low cost of purchasing electricity resulted in recovered heat following the demand. This shortfall in electricity generation required the system to purchase the majority of its electricity demand from the grid in all three cases. Due to the low price of selling electricity, no excess electricity was produced in any investigation.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon markets 3acase studies 3acoal 3aelectricity 3aequations 3aheat 3anatural gas 3aprices 3apurchasing 3asteam 3aAustralia1 aMeybodi, Mehdi Aghaei1 aBehnia, Masud0 tEnergy.g2013 Nov. 1, v. 61 p.291-307dElsevier Ltdx0360-54427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2013.08.0453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02708naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024002200117024001900139040001800158100002200176245010000198300001500298520137200313592002801685650001101713650001901724650002001743650001601763650001301779650000801792650001901800650001801819650001301837650001301850650001201863650001601875650003701891773015201928856006902080856010502149990002302254852000902277655001202286IND60643558620221121170519.0190511e20140911xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064355862DNAL7 a10.3791/516942doi7 aPMC48280692pmcid7 a252855322pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarson, Johnny L.10aFundamental technical elements of freeze-fracture/freeze-etch in biological electron microscopy  ap. e51694.  aFreeze-fracture/freeze-etch describes a process whereby specimens, typically biological or nanomaterial in nature, are frozen, fractured, and replicated to generate a carbon/platinum “cast” intended for examination by transmission electron microscopy. Specimens are subjected to ultrarapid freezing rates, often in the presence of cryoprotective agents to limit ice crystal formation, with subsequent fracturing of the specimen at liquid nitrogen cooled temperatures under high vacuum. The resultant fractured surface is replicated and stabilized by evaporation of carbon and platinum from an angle that confers surface three-dimensional detail to the cast. This technique has proved particularly enlightening for the investigation of cell membranes and their specializations and has contributed considerably to the understanding of cellular form to related cell function. In this report, we survey the instrument requirements and technical protocol for performing freeze-fracture, the associated nomenclature and characteristics of fracture planes, variations on the conventional procedure, and criteria for interpretation of freeze-fracture images. This technique has been widely used for ultrastructural investigation in many areas of cell biology and holds promise as an emerging imaging technique for molecular, nanotechnology, and materials science studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acell membranes 3acryoprotectants 3aevaporation 3afreezing 3aice 3aimage analysis 3ananomaterials 3anitrogen 3aplatinum 3asurveys 3atemperature 3atransmission electron microscopy0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2014 Sept. 11, , no. 91 p.e51694-e51694dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/516943Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/51694/fundamental-technical-elements-freeze-fracturefreeze-etch-biological  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02946naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245013300168300001600301520131600317592002801633650001301661650002401674650003101698650001501729650001701744653000801761653001801769653001401787653002801801653002401829653000801853653000801861653000801869653000801877653000901885653001101894653000801905653000801913653000801921653000801929653000801937700002001945700001801965700005901983700005302042700002002095700006302115700001802178773010202196856008502298852000902383655001202392IND60698493620221117203131.0200726e20200715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069849362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.powtec.2020.05.1112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJubaer, Hasan10aComputationally inexpensive simulation of agglomeration in spray drying while preserving structure related information using CFD  ap. 372-393.  aControlled agglomeration during spray drying offers several advantages for both powder manufacturers and consumers, and thus it is commonly implemented by industry. The implementation, however is largely based on experience, given the scarcity of comprehensive prediction tools. A resource-efficient approach to numerically treat agglomerates and yet provide an indication of their structures is desired to perform realistic simulations without the need for high-performance computing. In this work, a new numerical model for the treatment of coalescence and agglomeration was implemented and evaluated at two distinct scales with significantly different particle number densities within a Eulerian-Lagrangian CFD framework. The model could accurately predict the trends in the final particle size distributions and distinguish realistic agglomerate structures occurring under different conditions. Challenges were encountered as a result of how the underlying collision detection routine handles high particle number density. Several strategies are proposed to overcome these challenges. This work constitutes significant progress towards achieving an efficient prediction tool to estimate final powder properties and will prove useful in performing large-scale simulations to design and control agglomeration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aindustry 3amathematical models 3aparticle size distribution 3aprediction 3aspray drying 0aCFD 0aAgglomeration 0aCollision 0aDiscrete phase modeling 0aEulerian-Lagrangian 0aCDC 0aCFD 0aDEM 0aDPM 0aDSMC 0aMP-PIC 0aNTC 0aPSD 0aSEM 0aSST 0aUDF1 aAfshar, Sepideh1 aMejean, Serge1 aJeantet, Romain1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5405-50561 aXiao, Jie1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7842-78621 aChen, Xiao Dong1 aSelomulya, Cordelia1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5506-03081 aWoo, Meng Wai0 tPowder technology.g2020 July 15, v. 372 p.372-393dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11732x0032-59107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2020.05.1113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02915naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002200146245012100168300002000289520169100309592002802000650002302028650001102051650001202062650001502074650001702089650001802106650001902124650001202143650001202155650001102167650001902178650002202197700006002219773017302279856008002452852000902532655001202541IND60662499720221118042120.0190904e20190604xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066249972DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.9b008592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNagarajan, Sanjay10aPretreatment of Lignocellulosic Biomass Using Vortex-Based Devices for Cavitation: Influence on Biomethane Potential  ap. 15975-15988.  aLignocellulosic biomass (LCB) is an abundant renewable resource that can be used to produce fuels and chemicals. Valorization of LCB is, however, a challenge due to its recalcitrant nature posed by the strongly interlinked cellulose–lignin–hemicellulose structures. A range of physicochemical and biological LCB pretreatment methods has been reported in the literature for enhancing its bioutilization. In this work, we used hydrodynamic cavitation (HC) based on vortex devices as a chemical-free, environmentally friendly LCB pretreatment method to enhance biomethane production. A bench scale pretreatment setup using a vortex-based cavitation device was established for the pretreatment of two common LCBs: grass silage (GS) and sugar cane bagasse (SCB). Dried and powdered feedstocks were used in all the experiments. HC was carried out by operating the cavitation device at a flow rate of ∼1.5 m³/h. The feedstocks before and after pretreatment were characterized for morphological and compositional differences using a range of analytical techniques. Liquid phase products produced upon cavitation were also analyzed using an HPLC-RI. Biomethane potential (BMP) was measured for GS and SCB with and without pretreatment, and a first order model was used to describe the kinetics. Up to 40% enhancement was observed in BMP after cavitation pretreatment using vortex-based devices. A brief discussion on preliminary cost considerations based on the experimentally observed enhancement in BMP is included. The results indicate significant promise of harnessing hydrodynamic cavitation-based pretreatment using vortex-based devices for enhancing biomethane production from LCB.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical methods 3abiogas 3abiomass 3afeedstocks 3agrass silage 3ahydrodynamics 3alignocellulose 3aliquids 3amethane 3amodels 3aprocess design 3asugarcane bagasse1 aRanade, Vivek V.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0558-69710 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2019 June 04, v. 58, no. 35 p.15975-15988dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.9b008593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04033naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100005900188245010600247300001200353500001100365506007600376520262000452592002803072596004603100506003703146650001103183650002203194650001603216650002203232650001703254650002203271651001203293700001903305700002403324700002403348773016103372856008103533852000903614655001203623IND60679509320221207091851.0200721e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067950932DNAL7 a318820132pmid7 aPMC69351852pmcid7 a10.1186/s12966-019-0903-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBhuiyan, Nishat1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2947-667310aRural physical activity interventions in the United States: a systematic review and RE-AIM evaluation  ap. 140.  aReview  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Previous reviews of rural physical activity interventions were focused on intervention effectiveness and had reported overall mixed findings. The purpose of this systematic review was to apply the Reach, Efficacy, Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework to evaluate the extent to which rural physical activity interventions in the U.S. have reported on dimensions of internal and external validity and to offer suggestions for future physical activity interventions for rural U.S. populations. METHODS: Pubmed, PsychINFO, CINAHL, PAIS, and Web of Science were searched through February 2019 to identify physical activity intervention studies conducted in rural regions in the U.S. with adult populations. Titles, abstracts, and full texts of articles were reviewed against inclusion and exclusion criteria. Data extraction from included articles included a summary of study details, rural classification system used, and the presence or absence of a total 61 RE-AIM indicators, including reach (n = 13), efficacy/effectiveness (n = 10), adoption (n = 21), implementation (n = 9), and maintenance (n = 8). RESULTS: A total of 40 full-text articles representing 29 unique studies were included. Classifications of rurality included self-statements by authors (n = 19, 65.5%), population/census-based definitions (n = 3, 10.3%), Rural Urban Continuum Codes (n = 3, 10.3%), Rural Urban Commuting Area codes (n = 2, 6.9%), the 2014 Alabama Rural Health Association classification system (n = 1, 3.4%) and the U.S. Office of Management and Budget classification system (n = 1, 3.4%). Individual studies reported between 14.8 to 52.5% of total RE-AIM indicators. Studies reported 15.4 to 84.6% indicators for reach; 20.0 to 70.0% indicators for efficacy/effectiveness; 4.8 to 47.6% indicators for adoption; 11.1 to 88.9% indicators for implementation; and 0 to 25.0% indicators for maintenance. CONCLUSIONS: We found an overall poor reporting of components related to external validity, which hinders the generalizability of intervention findings, and a lack of consistency in the definition of rurality. Future research should focus on balancing factors of internal and external validity, and should aim to develop a greater understanding of how rurality influences health and behavior to provide contextual knowledge needed to advance the translation of physical activity interventions into practice in rural communities and reduce rural health disparities.

Only verticilactam, a compound with a characteristic β-ketoamide unit within a 16-membered polyketide macrolactam conjugated with an octalin skeleton, had been previously reported having been isolated from Streptomyces spiroverticillatus JC-8444. In this report, minor verticilactam derivatives were isolated from the transformed strain, and their structures elucidated by spectral analysis. Verticilactam B was a geometric isomer at Δ¹⁷ and Δ¹⁹, and verticilactam C was the Δ¹⁹ and Δ²¹ isomer. In addition, the absolute configuration of verticilactam was confirmed by ECD analysis and NMR chemical shifts. The stereochemistry assignments of the hydroxy groups at C-10 and C-12 were supported by the domain organization of the polyketide synthase identified in the verticilactam gene cluster. Verticilactam showed moderate activity against the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum 3D7 strain with no significant cytotoxicity or antimicrobial effects.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPlasmodium falciparum 3aStreptomyces avermitilis 3aStreptomyces spiroverticillatus 3abiosynthesis 3acytotoxicity 3ageometric isomers 3ageometry 3aheterologous gene expression 3amalaria 3amultigene family 3aparasites 3apolyketide synthases 3apolyketides 3askeleton 3aspectral analysis 3astereochemistry1 aTerai, Atsutaka1 aAmagai, Keita1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5804-40471 aHashimoto, Junko1 aFutamura, Yushi1 aOkano, Akiko1 aFujie, Manabu1 aSatoh, Noriyuki1 aIkeda, Haruo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3977-78561 aShin-ya, Kazuo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4702-06611 aOsada, Hiroyuki1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3606-49251 aTakahashi, Shunji1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1684-92980 tJournal of natural products.g2020 Nov. 20, v. 83, no. 12 p.3598-3605dAmerican Chemical Society and American Society of PharmacognosywJournal:jnl11422x1520-60257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jnatprod.0c007553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02259naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001500146245013900161300002000300520093600320592002801256650001201284650001401296650002301310650001001333650001801343650002601361650001401387650001901401650002401420650001401444650001201458700006101470700002301531700005701554773017301611856008001784852000901864655001201873IND60662499820221118042225.0190904e20190412xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066249982DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.9b008932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPfab, Evan10aValorization of Humins-Extracted 5-Methoxymethylfurfural: Toward High Added Value Furanics via Continuous Flow Catalytic Hydrogenation  ap. 16065-16070.  aThe formation of humins is one drawback of biomass valorization (e.g., hemicellulosic fraction) toward platform chemicals and fuels. Furanic compounds including 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) and 5-methoxymethylfurfural (MMF) can be extracted from humins and valorized. Unlike HMF, reactions with MMF have not been widely studied. In this work, MMF was extracted from humins aiming to its hydrogenation in continuous flow. Based on success from literature studies with HMF hydrogenation, 5% Ru/C and 5% Pd/C catalysts were employed, and both have demonstrated excellent conversion of MMF toward hydrogenation products (100%), with an interesting selectivity switch depending on reaction conditions. Ru-based catalysts were more prone to deactivation as compared to Pd catalysts and were extremely stable after a few hours on stream under the investigated reaction conditions. A reaction mechanism was proposed for MMF hydrogenation.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3afuels 3ahydrogenation 3ahydroxymethylfurfural 3apalladium 3aprocess design 3areaction mechanisms 3aruthenium 3astreams1 aFiliciotto, Layla1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6921-69211 aRomero, Antonio A.1 aLuque, Rafael1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4190-19160 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2019 Apr. 12, v. 58, no. 35 p.16065-16070dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.9b008933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01937naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245013200167300001600299520060000315592002800915650001600943650001600959650001200975650001500987650001201002650002601014650001401040650002101054650002301075650002301098650001101121650002901132650001101161650001401172653002601186653001901212653001401231653001101245653001101256700002001267773010101287856008201388852000901470655001201479IND60625774120221122040529.0190131e20190208xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062577412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2018.12.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSemba, Kazuhiko10aCross-coupling reactions by cooperative Pd/Cu or Ni/Cu catalysis based on the catalytic generation of organocopper nucleophiles  ap. 709-719.  aIn this review, cross-coupling reactions by cooperative Pd/Cu or Ni/Cu catalysis based on catalytically generated organocopper nucleophiles are summarized.

This study investigated polymorphisms of a metabolism-related gene, Klotho, and an inflammatory gene, IL6, for association with the aging process in a healthy Han Chinese population. A total of 482 healthy subjects were recruited and divided into aging and young groups according to chronological age and biological age. Snapshots were used to detect a Klotho gene tag SNP (rs571118) and the F-SNPs rs9536314 (F352V) and rs9527025 (C370S), and an interleukin 6 (IL-6) gene tag SNP (rs1524107) and the F-SNPs rs1800795 (−174G/C) and rs1800796 (−572G/C). Klotho F352V and IL-6-174G/C was G homozygous, C370S was T homozygous while IL-6-572G/C MAF less than 5%. There was a statistically significant difference in the Klotho rs571118 SNP between chronological age groups, but not biological age groups. However, other SNPs, including IL-6 gene SNPs, didn’t correlate with age in the Han Chinese population. Human aging is a complex process that includes chronological and biological aging. Our current data showed that Klotho gene rs571118 SNP was associated with chronological aging, but not biological aging, in a Han Chinese population. Further study will investigate genetic build up for the difference between chronological and biological aging.  aPublisher supplied data 3agenes 3ahomozygosity 3ahumans 3ainterleukin-6 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism1 aBai, X. -J.1 aChen, D. -P.1 aLv, Y.1 aSun, X. -F.1 aCai, G. -Y.1 aBai, X. -Y.1 aChen, Xiang-Mei0 tjournal of nutrition, health & aging.g2014 Dec., v. 18, no. 10 p.900-904dSpringer-Verlagx1279-77077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12603-014-0470-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03134naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245011900173300001800292520158400310592002801894650002501922650001601947650002501963650001501988650000902003650001302012650001202025650001202037650001402049650001502063650001602078650001702094650002102111650001002132650002202142650002802164650002102192650002602213653001002239653001302249653001002262653002502272700001802297700001902315700002002334773016702354856008602521852000902607655001202616IND60776709120221122012743.0220726e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077670912DNAL7 a10.1016/S2095-3119(20)63578-X2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiao-shuai, ZHANG10aPhysiological mitochondrial ROS regulate diapause by enhancing HSP60/Lon complex stability in Helicoverpa armigera  ap. 1703-1712.  aDiapause is a long-lived stage which has evolved into an important strategy for insects to circumvent extreme environments. In the pupal stage, Helicoverpa armigera can enter diapause, a state characterized by significantly decreased metabolic activity and enhanced stress resistance, to survive cold winters. Previous studies have shown that reactive oxygen species (ROS) can promote the diapause process by regulating a distinct insulin signaling pathway. However, the source of ROS in the diapause-destined pupal brains and mechanisms by which ROS regulate diapause are still unknown. In this study, we showed that diapause-destined pupal brains accumulated high levels of mitochondrial ROS (mtROS) and total ROS during the diapause process, suggesting that mitochondria are the main source of ROS in diapause-destined pupal brains. In addition, injection of 2-deoxy-D-glucose (DOG), a glucose metabolism inhibitor, could delay pupal development by elevating mtROS levels in the nondiapause-destined pupal brains. Furthermore, the injection of a metabolite mixture to increase metabolic activity could avert the diapause process in diapause-destined pupae by decreasing mtROS levels. We also found that ROS could activate HSP60 expression and promote the stability of the HSP60-Lon complex, increasing its ability to degrade mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) and decreasing mitochondrial activity or biogenesis under oxidative stress. Thus, this study illustrated the beneficial function of ROS in diapause or lifespan extension by decreasing mitochondrial activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHelicoverpa armigera 3aagriculture 3abiochemical pathways 3abiogenesis 3acold 3adiapause 3aglucose 3ainsulin 3alongevity 3ametabolism 3ametabolites 3amitochondria 3aoxidative stress 3apupae 3apupal development 3areactive oxygen species 3astress tolerance 3atranscription factors 0amtROS 0adiapause 0aHSP60 0aHelicoverpa armigera1 aXiao-long, SU1 aShao-lei, GENG1 aZheng-hao, WANG0 tJournal of integrative agriculture.g2022 June, v. 21, no. 6 p.1703-1712dElsevier B.V.aCAAS.

Polymorphisms in the ADIPOQ gene likely have an impact on growth traits in cattle. In this study, we examined the relationship between ADIPOQ polymorphisms and body measurement parameters in Chinese beef cattle. First, we sequenced ADIPOQ and 1.2 kb of DNA upstream of its promoter, and we found 14 polymorphisms. With the luciferase reporter assay, we showed that the two polymorphisms SNP PR_–135 A>G and PR_–68 G>C, which are located in the core region of promoter, influence promoter activity of ADIPOQ. Second, we identified three haplotypes involved in these two polymorphic sites: A (A–₁₃₅/C–₆₈), B (A–₁₃₅/G–₆₈), and C (G–₁₃₅/G–₆₈). Haplotypes B and C are major haplotypes in five Chinese populations of cattle (Qinchuan, Nanyang, Jiaxian, Hazakh, and Chinese Holstein). We studied the effects of these three haplotypes on body measurements, gene expression, and promoter activity, and we found that the genotypes are associated with body measurement parameters in Qinchuan cattle. Individuals with genotype BC (AG/GG) had significantly higher body height and heart girth than others, and this result may be interpreted by the following two observations. The promoter activity with haplotype B (A/G) is significantly higher than those with A (A/C) and C (G/G) in driving reporter gene transcription; the ADIPOQ mRNA level in cattle with genotype BC (AG/GG) is relatively lower than that in cattle with genotype BB (AA/GG).  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aHolstein 3aadiponectin 3aadipose tissue 3abeef cattle 3abody measurements 3abone metabolism 3agene expression 3aglucose 3agrowth traits 3ahaplotypes 3aheart 3alipids 3aluciferase 3amessenger RNA 3ametabolism 3apromoter regions 3areporter genes 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3atranscription (genetics) 0aADIPOQ gene 0aChinese cattle 0ahaplotype 0abody measurements1 aLi, Mijie1 aLai, Xinsheng1 aYang, Mingjuan1 aXu, Yao1 aHua, Liushuai1 aLan, Xianyong1 aZhang, Chunlei1 aChen, Hong0 tGenome.g2013 Aug. 15, v. 56, no. 7 p.389-394dNRC Research Pressx1480-33217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/gen-2013-00543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02546naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001800166245007900184300001600263520149800279592002801777650001301805650001401818650001201832650001201844650001401856650001001870650001501880700001801895700001501913700002801928700002601956773011201982856008102094852000902175655001202184IND60119875420221120160434.0150114e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011987542DNAL7 a254708032pmid7 a10.1007/s12603-014-0474-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDuncan, M.

However, few studies have assessed the effect of caffeine ingestion on performance, particularly functional performance in older adults. The present study aims to assess the effect of acute caffeine ingestion on functional performance, manual dexterity and readiness to invest effort in older adults. METHODS: 19 apparently healthy, volunteers (10 females and 9 males aged 61–79; 66±2 years) performed tests of functional fitness and manual dexterity post ingestion of caffeine (3mg*kg-1) or placebo in a randomised order. Pre and 60 minutes post ingestion, participants also completed measures of readiness to invest physical (RTIPE) and mental (RTIME) effort. RESULTS: A series of repeated measures ANOVAS indicated enhanced performance in the following functional fitness tests; arm curls (P =.04), 8 foot up and go (P =.007), six minute walk (P =.016). Manual dexterity was also improved in the presence of caffeine (P =.001). RTIME increased (P =.015) pre to post ingestion in the caffeine condition but not in the placebo condition. There were no significant main effects or interactions for RTIPE or gender in any analysis (all P>gt;.05). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that acute caffeine ingestion positively enhances functional performance, manual dexterity and readiness to invest effort in apparently healthy older adults.  aPublisher supplied data 3acaffeine 3acognition 3aelderly 3afemales 3aingestion 3amales 3avolunteers1 aClarke, N.

The copper WLHP has a two-pass evaporator section and a two-pass condenser section, each pass is 330 mm in length with an inner tube diameter of 11.2 mm. The considered configuration is similar to that used to build industrial heat exchangers, which are used for heat recovery in energy efficient air handling units. R134a is chosen as the WLHP working fluid as it is widely used. A variable output electrical heater was used to heat the evaporator section with the condenser section being cooled using a 2-pass shell and tube heat exchanger, equipped with 7 baffles to enforce coolant (water) cross flow around the condenser tubes. An average heat pipe thermal resistance expression, based on the experimental data, is introduced and used to characterise the thermal performance for the WLHP under the considered experimental conditions. The nature of the heat transfer processes and the working fluid path within the heat pipe are analysed under various operational conditions and areas of enhancement for this type of heat pipes are identified. An average value for the WLHP overall effective thermal resistances as low as 0.048 °C/W is reported.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aenergy efficiency 3aenergy recovery 3aheat exchangers 3aheat tolerance 3aheat transfer 3apipes1 aEzzuddin, Hatem0 tEnergy.g2013 Nov. 1, v. 61 p.128-138dElsevier Ltdx0360-54427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2012.10.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03026naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245011500173300001600288520183400304592002802138650002502166650001902191650001302210650001202223650001302235650002202248650001702270650001202287650001102299651001102310700002102321700002402342700002102366700002102387700001702408773011302425856008102538852000902619655001202628IND60123885420221119135811.0150411e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012388542DNAL7 a10.1007/s10144-014-0459-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChandler, Jennifer L.10aTiller population dynamics of reciprocally transplanted Eriophorum vaginatum L. ecotypes in a changing climate  ap. 117-126.  aMoist tussock tundra, dominated by the sedge Eriophorum vaginatum L., covers approximately 3.36 × 108 km2 of arctic surface area along with large amounts of subarctic land area. Eriophorum vaginatum exhibits ecotypic differentiation along latitudinal gradients in Alaska. While ecotypic differentiation may be beneficial during periods of climate stability, it may be detrimental as climate changes, causing adaptational lag. Following harvest of a 30-year reciprocal transplant experiment, age-specific demographic data on E. vaginatum tillers were collected to parameterize a Leslie matrix. Yellow Taxi analysis, based on Tukey’s Jackknife, was used to determine mean pseudovalues of tiller population growth rate (ϕ i  ¯ ) for four source populations of E. vaginatum tussocks that were transplanted to each of three gardens along a latitudinal gradient. Source populations responded differentially along the latitudinal gradient. Survival and daughter tiller production influenced differences seen at the mid-latitude garden, and the overall tiller population performance was generally improved by northward transplanting relative to southward transplanting. A comparison of home-source ϕ i  ¯  and away-source ϕ i  ¯  within the same transplant garden indicates no home-site advantage. Although populations were still growing when transplanted to home-sites (ϕ i  ¯  = 1.056), tiller population growth rate increased as ΔGDD became more negative relative to the home site (i.e., as tussocks were transplanted north). These results imply that populations are affected by climate gradients in a manner consistent with adaptational lag. This study documenting the response of high-latitude ecotypes to climate gradients may be an indication of the possible future effects of climate shift in more southern latitudes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEriophorum vaginatum 3aclimate change 3aecotypes 3agardens 3alatitude 3apopulation growth 3asurface area 3atillers 3atundra 3aAlaska1 aMcGraw, James B.1 aBennington, Cynthia1 aShaver, Gaius R.1 aVavrek, Milan C.1 aFetcher, Ned0 tPopulation ecology.g2015 Jan., v. 57, no. 1 p.117-126dSpringer-VerlagwJournal:jnl3871701x1438-38967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10144-014-0459-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02468naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245007600171300001800247500001900265520119400284592002801478650001701506650001501523650001601538650002201554650002801576650002201604650000901626650001101635650001401646650001701660700002201677700002101699700002301720700006001743773017401803856008401977852000902061655001202070IND60721477920210617000000.0201224e20201208xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072147792DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jnatprod.0c008542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPetrova, Olga N.10aSoluble Guanylate Cyclase Inhibitors Discovered among Natural Compounds  ap. 3642-3651.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSoluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) is the human receptor of nitric oxide (NO) in numerous kinds of cells and produces the second messenger 3′,5′-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) upon NO binding to its heme. sGC is involved in many cell signaling pathways both under healthy conditions and under pathological conditions, such as angiogenesis associated with tumor growth. Addressing the selective inhibition of the NO/cGMP pathway is a strategy worthwhile to be investigated for slowing down tumoral angiogenesis or for curing vasoplegia. However, sGC inhibitors are lacking investigation. We have explored a chemical library of various natural compounds and have discovered inhibitors of sGC. The selected compounds were evaluated for their inhibition of purified sGC in vitro and sGC in endothelial cells. Six natural compounds, from various organisms, have IC₅₀ in the range 0.2–1.5 μM for inhibiting the NO-activated synthesis of cGMP by sGC, and selected compounds exhibit a quantified antiangiogenic activity using an endothelial cell line. These sGC inhibitors can be used directly as tools to investigate angiogenesis and cell signaling or as templates for drug design.  aPublisher supplied data 3aangiogenesis 3acell lines 3adrug design 3aendothelial cells 3aguanosine monophosphate 3aguanylate cyclase 3aheme 3ahumans 3aneoplasms 3anitric oxide1 aLamarre, Isabelle1 aFasani, Fabienne1 aGrillon, Catherine1 aNegrerie, Michel1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9918-031X0 tJournal of natural products.g2020 Dec. 08, v. 83, no. 12 p.3642-3651dAmerican Chemical Society and American Society of PharmacognosywJournal:jnl11422x1520-60257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jnatprod.0c008543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02252naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006000150245009600210300001600306520090200322592002801224650002001252650001501272650001701287650002001304650001301324650002001337650001501357650001801372653002201390653002201412653002501434653003201459700006401491700002701555700003501582700002901617773010201646856008501748852000901833655001201842IND60698494520221117203042.0200726e20200715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069849452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.powtec.2020.06.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHilo, Ali Kareem1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0889-080810aExperimental study of nanofluids flow and heat transfer over a backward-facing step channel  ap. 497-505.  aThe forced convective heat transfer and friction factor of nanofluids flow over a backward-facing step (BFS) in a channel with the base wall dissipating a uniform heat flux are experimentally investigated in this paper. Nanoparticles such as CuO and MgO dispersed in pure ethylene glycol (EG) with average diameters of 40 nm, and volume concentrations of 0, 1, 3, and 5% are considered as the working nanofluids. The results indicate that the heat transfer rate increases as the volume concentration of nanoparticles increased. The Nusselt number is enhanced up to 11% at 0.05 volume concentration compared to pure EG. The friction factor increases up to approximately 15% at Reynolds number (Re) of 5000 and volume concentrations of 0.01 and 0.03.

The extraction efficiency of total phenolics, flavonoids and rosmarinic acid depends strongly on the fractionation conditions. Ethyl acetate fraction was determined to have good gallic acid equivalents (GAEs) value of 227.38–373.92 mg/g fraction and rutin equivalents (REs) value 73.38–86.63 mg/g fraction. Rosmarinic acid was determined by HPLC and liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis and showed highest content (51.37–155.50 mg/g fraction) in ethyl acetate fractions. The ethyl acetate fractions was shown strong reducing power (1.60–1.66) and indicated effectively radical scavenging activity (89.48–90.74%). In addition, chloroform fractions presented remarkable antioxidant abilities in the linoleic acid emulsion system. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Perilla frutescens var. acuta has been used as an edible biologic medicine in Eastern Asia for more than a thousand years. The leaves, stem and fruit of this plant are used individually to treat a variety of diseases. More precisely, P. frutescens leaves are used to induce perspiration and dispelchills and to regulate stomach function. Phenolic compounds in this plant extract, such as rosmarinic acid, are most likely to be responsible for these bioactivities. In this study, various extracts and fractions of P. frutescens leaves were used to determine rosmarinic acid and the antioxidant activities. Our results suggest that P. frutescens could potentially be used as a natural antioxidant and effective functional and active properties to provide new marketable bio‐products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPerilla frutescens 3aacetates 3aantioxidant activity 3achloroform 3aemulsions 3afractionation 3afree radical scavengers 3afruits 3afunctional properties 3agallic acid 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aleaves 3alinoleic acid 3amass spectrometry 3amedicine 3aplant extracts 3arosmarinic acid 3arutin 3astems 3astomach 3aEast Asia1 aPARK, KI HWAN1 aKIM, GUN‐HEE0 tJournal of food biochemistry.g2011 Dec., v. 35, no. 6 p.1637-1645dBlackwell Publishing Incx0145-88847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-4514.2010.00481.x  aDNAL 7aarticle03182naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002800143245011600171300001600287520142000303592002801723650002401751650002301775650002101798650001001819650001901829650001201848650001501860650001101875650001101886650001201897650001401909650001301923650001901936651001301955651001101968653002101979653001902000653001202019653002702031700002802058700003502086700002502121700002902146700004202175700003102217700003702248700003202285700003402317700003902351773013902390856007802529852000902607655001202616IND60688044620221120132515.0200707e20200701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068804462DNAL7 a10.1089/vbz.2019.25272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAraújo, Maisa da Silva10aFirst Observation of Experimental Plasmodium vivax Infection of Three Malaria Vectors from the Brazilian Amazon  ap. 517-523.  aAlthough malaria is endemic to the Amazon region, little is known about the susceptibility of potential parasite vectors in Brazil. Assessing the vector susceptibility of Anopheles mosquitoes will increase our understanding of parasite–vector interactions and aid the design of vector control strategies. This study assessed the susceptibility of three Anopheles species to midgut infection by Plasmodium vivax, the predominant malaria species in Rondônia State, Brazil. Blood from P. vivax infected patients was fed to Anopheles aquasalis, Anopheles darlingi, and Anopheles deaneorum mosquitoes using a membrane feeding assay (MFA). Gametocytemia was estimated by microscopic examination of blood smears and oocyst prevalence, and infection intensity was assessed. The presence of oocysts was determined by microscopy, and the infection rates and infection intensity were determined for all species. Data from six MFAs showed that An. darlingi and An. deaneorum exhibited the highest infection rates (97% and 90%, respectively) and developed a similar median number of P. vivax oocysts (142 and 123, respectively), while An. aquasalis exhibited the smallest infection rates (77%) and the median number of oocysts (88). Established laboratory colonies of An. darlingi and An. deaneorum and susceptibility to plasmodial infection would be beneficial for modeling P. vivax vector–parasite interactions in Brazil.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnopheles aquasalis 3aAnopheles darlingi 3aPlasmodium vivax 3ablood 3ainsect vectors 3amalaria 3amicroscopy 3amidgut 3amodels 3aoocysts 3aparasites 3apatients 3avector control 3aAmazonia 3aBrazil 0aPlasmodium vivax 0amalaria vector 0aoocysts 0amembrane feeding assay1 aAndrade, Alice Oliveira1 ados Santos, Najara Akira Costa1 aCastro, Raphael Brum1 aPereira, Dhélio Batista1 aRodrigues, Moreno Magalhães de Souza1 aCosta, Glaucilene da Silva1 aJúnior, Antonio Marques Pereira1 aCarvalho, Luís Paulo Costa1 ade Medeiros, Jansen Fernandes1 aPereira-da-Silva, Luiz Hidelbrando0 tVector borne and zoonotic diseases.g2020 July 01, v. 20, no. 7 p.517-523dMary Ann Liebert, Inc.wJournal:J000000160x1557-77597nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1089/vbz.2019.25273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03562naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001500146245020200161300001600363520171800379592002802097650001802125650001702143650001202160650001902172650001402191650001302205650001302218650002902231650002602260650001902286650001102305650001302316650001202329650001702341650001202358650001302370650001002383650001902393650001102412650001802423650001402441650001602455651001502471651002502486653001402511653001102525653002302536653001702559653002102576653001602597653002302613653001302636653001502649653001802664700001802682700001802700773010502718856008002823852000902903655001202912IND60622261520221120195213.0181124e200711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062226152DNAL7 a10.1177/09596836070824132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBeer, Ruth10aVegetation history, fire history and lake development recorded for 6300 years by pollen, charcoal, loss on ignition and chironomids at a small lake in southern Kyrgyzstan (Alay Range, Central Asia)  ap. 977-985.  aAnalyses of pollen, microscopic charcoal, loss on ignition (LOI) and chironomids in the sediment of the small sub-alpine lake Kichikol (2541 m a.s.l.; 39°59'N, 73°33'E; Alay Range, Kyrgyzstan) provide new data to reconstruct the vegetational and lacustrine history during the past 6300 years. From 6300—5100 calibrated ¹⁴C years BP (cal. yr BP) semi-deserts with Chenopodiaceae and Ephedra and rather open Juniperus stands persisted around the lake. At 5100—4000 cal. yr BP dense Juniperus forest established. Around 4000 cal. yr BP the forest retreated and was probably restricted to north-facing slopes, as is the case today. Changes in the hydrology of Kichikol are inferred from lithological properties, pollen of aquatic plants and remains of aquatic invertebrates. The lacustrine development of Kichikol suggests a step-wise increase in humidity during the mid and late Holocene, with major shifts recorded at 5000 and 4000 cal. yr BP. At the beginning of the record Kichikol was a very shallow, possibly temporary pond. An initial rise in water-table is registered at c. 5000 cal. yr BP, followed by a second rise to near present levels at c. 4000 cal. yr BP. These hydrological shifts could be related to an increase of westerly moisture transport from the Mediterranean region as a consequence of a late-Holocene weakening of the Central Asian High and Indian monsoon systems. Moderate human impact in the region is recorded after 2100 cal. yr BP, as indicated by pollen of Plantago lanceolata-type and a slight increase of charcoal accumulation rates. Considering the general course of climate as well as human impact we conclude that the present forest composition is natural or quasi-natural.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmaranthaceae 3aChironomidae 3aEphedra 3aHolocene epoch 3aJuniperus 3aPlantago 3aaltitude 3aanthropogenic activities 3aaquatic invertebrates 3aaquatic plants 3acarbon 3acharcoal 3aclimate 3afire history 3aforests 3ahumidity 3alakes 3amonsoon season 3apollen 3aradionuclides 3asediments 3awater table 3aKyrgyzstan 3aMediterranean region 0aJuniperus 0apollen 0anatural vegetation 0afire history 0alake development 0achironomids 0alake-level changes 0aHolocene 0aKyrgyzstan 0aCentral Asia.1 aHeiri, Oliver1 aTinner, Willy0 tHolocene.g2007 Nov., v. 17, no. 7 p.977-985dSage PublicationswJournal:J000001502x0959-68367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/09596836070824133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03375naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100005900145245013500204300001800339500001900357500002000376520216700396592002802563596002302591650002402614650001502638650001402653650002302667650002502690650001102715700001702726700006702743773012702810856007902937852000903016655001203025IND60688044720221120132437.0200407e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068804472DNAL7 a10.1111/1365-2656.131602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGilsenan, Carol1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6054-146110aTiming of arrival in the breeding area is repeatable and affects reproductive success in a non‐migratory population of blue tits  ap. 1017-1031.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aEvents in one part of the annual cycle often affect the performance (and subsequently fitness) of individuals later in the season (carry‐over effects). An important aspect of this relates to the timing of activities. For example, many studies on migratory birds have shown that relatively late‐spring arrival in the breeding area reduces both the likelihood of getting a mate or territory and reproductive success. In contrast, relatively little is known about the movements of individuals in non‐migratory populations during the non‐breeding season. Few studies have investigated the timing of arrival at the breeding area in such species, possibly due to the assumption that most individuals remain in the area during the non‐breeding season. In this study, we used 4 years of data from a transponder‐based automated recording system set up in a non‐migratory population of blue tits Cyanistes caeruleus to describe individual variation in arrival at the breeding site. We investigated whether this variation can be explained by individual characteristics (sex, body size or status), and we assessed its effect on aspects of reproductive success in the subsequent breeding season. We found substantial variation in arrival date and demonstrate that this trait is individual‐specific (repeatable). Females arrived later than males, but the arrival dates of social pair members were more similar than expected by chance, which suggests that individuals may mate assortatively depending on their arrival in the breeding area. Arrival predicted both whether an individual would end up breeding that season and several aspects of its breeding success. Our study suggests that individuals of non‐migratory species leave the breeding area during the non‐breeding season. Hence, it may be useful to consider variation in the scale of movements between breeding and non‐breeding sites, rather than using a simple dichotomy between ‘resident’ and ‘migratory’ species. We conclude that the timing of pre‐breeding events, in particular arrival date, may be an overlooked, but important, fitness‐relevant trait in non‐migratory species.  aPublisher supplied data  cMax Planck Society 3aCyanistes caeruleus 3aautomation 3abody size 3amigratory behavior 3areproductive success 3aspring1 aValcu, Mihai1 aKempenaers, B.q(Bart),1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7505-54580 tjournal of animal ecology.g2020 Apr., v. 89, no. 4 p.1017-1031dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl16424x0021-87907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.131603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02452naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245013700161520141800298592002801716650001101744650002901755650001701784650001101801650002001812650002401832651001001856651001801866700001901884700001301903773012701916856007402043852000902117655001202126IND60652863120221120033442.0190713e20190319xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065286312DNAL7 a10.3390/su110616472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Chengliang 10aSpatial Dynamics of Intercity Technology Transfer Networks in China’s Three Urban Agglomerations: A Patent Transaction Perspective  aTechnology transfer has become a vital pipeline for acquiring external knowledge. The purpose of this paper is to portray the spatial dynamics of intercity technology transfer networks in China&rsquo;s three urban agglomerations based on patent right transaction data from 2008 to 2015. The integration of social networks and spatial visualization is used to explore spatial networks and influencing variables of the networks. The results demonstrate that Beijing, Shanghai, and Shenzhen are emerging as hubs in the three urban agglomerations. The spatial distributions of degree and weighted degree are significantly heterogeneous and hierarchical. The larger cities play the role of a knowledge and technology incubator, highly related to their economic scale, research and development (R&amp;D) input, and innovation output. The evolution of intercity technology linkages is driven by the networking mechanisms of preferential attachment, hierarchical and contagious diffusion, path dependence, and path breaking. Moreover, we found that the geographical proximity and technology gaps are determinants of the strength of intercity technology linkages. As a result, it has been discovered that the network in the Beijing&ndash;Tianjin&ndash;Hebei agglomeration is organized in a tree network, while the Yangtze River Delta features a polycentric network and the Pearl River Delta has multi-star characteristics.  aPublisher supplied data 3acities 3aresearch and development 3ariver deltas 3arivers 3asocial networks 3atechnology transfer 3aChina 3aYangtze River1 aNiu, Caicheng 1 aHan, Ji 0 tSustainability.g2019 Mar. 19, v. 11, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su110616473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02769naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245007500172520143600247592002801683650000901711650002201720650001201742650001101754650002001765650003101785650002601816650002401842650001001866653002601876653002601902653001101928653002301939653001601962653001901978700006201997700002102059700002602080700002102106773011302127856008602240852000902326655001202335IND60701035520221121095327.0210212e20201020xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070103552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1225192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaldasso, Enrico10aPotential of liquefied natural gas cold energy recovery on board ships  aLiquefied natural gas is stored on board vessels under cryogenic conditions, and hence, fuel preheating is required before injection in the engine. The cooling effect associated with this preheating phase can be utilized to decrease the vessel’s overall fuel consumption. Previous works focused on evaluating the prospects for cold energy recovery for specific applications, but failed to provide a detailed overview of the potential uses of liquefied natural gas cold energy recovery on board ships. The objective of this paper is to provide a detailed overview of the potential uses of liquefied natural gas cold energy recovery on board ships, including discussing their prospects in terms of fuel savings and constraints. The evaluations are based on the use of validated numerical models and are carried out for two reference vessels: a ferry featuring a low pressure fuel supply system, and a long-distance containership featuring a high pressure fuel supply system. The results of the study indicate that the greatest fuel savings can be attained when the vessel is powered by a low pressure fuel supply system, reaching up to 2.4%, and that the most promising solution for recovering the cold energy is its use in the organic Rankine cycle unit. The findings of this work provide the scientific basis needed for further research work and the subsequent commercialization of installations of cold energy recovery on ships.  aPublisher supplied data 3acold 3acommercialization 3acooling 3aenergy 3aenergy recovery 3aenergy use and consumption 3aliquefied natural gas 3amathematical models 3aships 0aLiquefied natural gas 0aOrganic rankine cycle 0aVessel 0aEngine air cooling 0aHVAC system 0aEnergy savings1 aMondejar, Maria E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8734-67571 aMazzoni, Stefano1 aRomagnoli, Alessandro1 aHaglind, Fredrik0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2020 Oct. 20, v. 271 p.122519-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1225193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02647naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151242013100169245010300300300001600403520130000419592002801719650001901747650001101766650001501777650002301792650001501815650001201830650001001842650001301852650001301865653002201878653001401900653001301914653002201927700002001949700002401969773012501993856008502118961001302203852000902216655001202225IND60694438720221120115830.0200513e20171020xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069443872DNAL7 a10.1080/00218839.2017.13697072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVilla, Jose D10aRepetibilidad de las mediciones de la eliminación de la cría infestada por ácaros para evaluar la higiene sensible a Varroa10aRepeatability of measurements of removal of mite-infested brood to assess Varroa Sensitive Hygiene  ap. 631-634.  aVarroa Sensitive Hygiene (VSH) is a useful resistance trait that honey bee (Apis mellifera) breeders could increase in different populations with cost-effective and reliable tests. We investigated the reliability of a one-week test estimating the changes in infestation of brood introduced into colonies highly selected for VSH and into unselected colonies. We repeated tests on the same 32 colonies up to five times and compared variation within colonies and between colonies of the two types. As expected, selected VSH colonies decreased infestation much more than unselected colonies (−77 vs. −5%, p < 0.0001) and also produced final mite populations in the introduced comb with higher infertility (41 vs. 16%, p = 0.002). The variance in percentage decrease in infestation of introduced brood within colonies was higher in the unselected group. These variances can be used to estimate the number of repeated tests required to detect true differences between colonies. In an already selected VSH population, potentially useful differences between colonies (ca. 45%) can be detected with only one measurement per colony. Multiple measurements of colonies (up to 5 replications) are required to detect similar differences between colonies in less selected and more variable populations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aApis mellifera 3aVarroa 3aapiculture 3acost effectiveness 3ahoney bees 3ahygiene 3amites 3aresearch 3avariance 0aVarroa destructor 0aselection 0abreeding 0ahygienic behavior1 aDanka, Robert G1 aHarris, Jeffrey W.,0 tJournal of apicultural research.g2017 Oct. 20, v. 56, no. 5 p.631-634dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12840x2078-69137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00218839.2017.13697073Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle04128naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001900144245016100163300002000324520231200344592002802656650001002684650001702694650001902711650002502730650001502755650002502770650001702795650001302812650001102825650002402836650001302860650001902873650001702892650004102909650002502950650002102975650001502996650002303011650001503034650002603049650001203075653002403087653003503111653002603146653003103172700001703203700001403220700001703234700001703251700005303268773014203321856007803463852000903541655001203550IND60654262620221119151827.0190724e20190628xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065426262DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.9b071472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Chenchen10aSubstrate Compliance Directs the Osteogenic Lineages of Stem Cells from the Human Apical Papilla via the Processes of Mechanosensing and Mechanotransduction  ap. 26448-26459.  aIt is well recognized that the interaction between stem cells and their physical microenvironment plays a fundamental role in controlling cell behaviors and directing lineage commitment, which eventually determines cell fate. Any change in the physical characteristics of the extracellular matrix in terms of topography, geometry, and stiffness has a strong effect on this interaction. Nevertheless, the precise biomechanism that regulates the responses of stem cells to the biophysical properties of substrates is not fully understood. In this study, we generated a series of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) substrates with different stiffness properties and explored the whole process involved in the determination of osteogenic lineage in stem cells from the human apical papilla (hSCAPs) in response to substrate stiffness. We first found that the hSCAPs responded to different substrate stiffnesses by changing their cell morphologies and cytoskeletons (via changes in α-tubulin and β-tubulin in microtubules and F-actin in microfilaments). We then found that the hSCAPs secreted more fibronectin in response to the stiffer substrates. We next found that fibronectin interacted with focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and paxillin in the FA plaques, and moreover, the expressions of FAK and paxillin were enhanced as the substrate stiffness increased. We further found that FAK and paxillin directly interacted with β-catenin. Furthermore, the accumulation of β-catenin in the nuclear region was strengthened as the substrate stiffness increased. We finally detected the changes of Lef-1 and TCF-1 in osteogenic-induced hSCAPs and found that their expressions were enhanced as the substrate stiffness increased. Lef-1 and TCF-1, as the transcriptional factors in the nucleus, potentially bound to the promoter region of Runx2 and might ultimately determine the osteogenic lineage in hSCAPs. These results indicate the important effect of stiffness in the microenvironment on the osteogenic lineage of hSCAPs and increase the understanding of the biomechanisms involved in the molecular signal cascade during mechanosensing, mechanotransduction, and stem cell differentiation, which will be useful in the biological fields of cell–matrix/cell–cell interactions and tissue engineering/regenerative medicine.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactin 3abeta catenin 3abone formation 3acell differentiation 3acompliance 3aextracellular matrix 3afibronectins 3ageometry 3ahumans 3amechanotransduction 3amedicine 3amicrofilaments 3amicrotubules 3anon-specific protein-tyrosine kinase 3apolydimethylsiloxane 3apromoter regions 3astem cells 3atissue engineering 3atopography 3atranscription factors 3atubulin 0asubstrate stiffness 0astem cells from apical papilla 0afocal adhesion plaque 0aosteogenic differentiation1 aZhang, Demao1 aZou, Jing1 aLi, Xiaobing1 aZou, Shujuan1 aXie, Jing1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8156-03220 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2019 June 28, v. 11, no. 29 p.26448-26459dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b071473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03202naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002000146245007600166300001700242520183400259592002802093650001602121650001202137650002102149650001102170650001402181650001202195650002202207650002302229650001302252650001002265650001402275650003002289650001202319651002002331653003702351653002002388653003002408653002402438653002802462700002902490700001802519773010602537856008002643852000902723655001202732IND60622261720221120195249.0181124e200711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062226172DNAL7 a10.1177/09596836070824152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSloss, Craig R.10aHolocene sea-level change on the southeast coast of Australia: a review  ap. 999-1014.  aA revised Holocene sea-level curve for the southeast coast of New South Wales, Australia, is presented based on a review of previously published geochronological results for fossil molluscs, organic-rich mud, mangrove roots and fixed biological indicators. It is supplemented by new radiocarbon and amino acid racemization-derived ages on fossil molluscs from transgressive sandsheet facies in back-barrier settings within shallow incised valleys along the southern coast of New South Wales. This data base has been limited to fossils with accurate descriptions of their facies associations and stratigraphic relationships to present mean sea level. Results show that sea level during the Holocene marine transgression rose to between −15 and −11 m at 9400—9000 cal. yr BP. Sea level then rose to approximately −5 m by 8500 cal. yr BP and to approximately −3.5 m between 8300 and 8000 cal. yr BP inundating shallow incised valleys resulting in the deposition of shell-rich transgressive sandsheets within shallow incised bedrock valleys. Present sea level was attained between 7900 and 7700 cal. yr BP, approximately 700—900 years earlier than previously proposed. Sea level continued to rise to between +1 and +1.5 m between 7700 and 7400 cal. yr BP, followed by a sea-level highstand that lasted until about 2000 cal. yr BP followed by a gradual fall to present. A series of minor negative and positive oscillations in relative sea level during the late-Holocene sea-level highstand appear to be superimposed over the general sea-level trend. However, the precise nature of the oscillations are difficult to quantify because of problems associated with accurately determining palaeotidal and wave regimes, climatic conditions and the antecedent morphology of the shallow marine environments during the mid Holocene.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acids 3abedrock 3aclimatic factors 3acoasts 3adatabases 3afossils 3aindicator species 3amarine environment 3amolluscs 3aroots 3asea level 3atransgressive segregation 3avalleys 3aNew South Wales 0aHolocene estuarine sedimentation 0aincised valleys 0arelative sea-level change 0asoutheast Australia 0atransgressive deposits.1 aMurray-Wallace, Colin V.1 aJones, B.

We use hidden Markov models (HMMs) fitted in a Bayesian framework and hourly Global Positioning System fixes to distinguish animal movements into distinct states and analyse the influence of environmental variables on being in, and switching to, a particular state. Specifically, we apply our models to understand elephant movement decisions around agricultural fields, and crop consumption. As it is unclear what the role of habitat features are on this complex process, we analyse whether elephants target agricultural crops for consumption, or simply pass through them in search of water. Our HMMs separate elephant movements into two states: exploratory movements that are fast and directional, and encamped movements that are slow and meandering. For each elephant, we ran 16 models with each possible combination of selected habitat features (river, elephant corridor, agricultural field, trees), and repeated these analyses including interaction effects with both season and time of day. We used cross‐validation to select the best model. In corridors, exploratory movements are dominant. Elephants mainly showed encamped movements at the river during the dry season, when temporary water sources have dried out and elephants relied on this permanent water source. In fields, males most often exhibited exploratory movements to and from the river, while females showed an increase in the frequency of encamped behaviour during the dry season and at night—the times when most crop consumption and movements through fields occur. Adaptation to risk could explain this behaviour, since foraging in fields is likely less risky under the cover of darkness and during the dry season when farmers are absent. This sex segregation in elephant movement decisions highlights the importance of predation risk in shaping movement patterns, which can result in sex segregation in responses to mitigation methods. The increase in encamped movements in the dry season suggests the importance of agricultural timing, and shows the potential for early ploughing and early‐harvest crop types in order to reduce elephant crop consumption. Taking this into account could increase efficiency of elephant crop consumption mitigation.  aPublisher supplied data  cNERC Oxford DTP Environmental Research  cPembroke College Oxford  cStichting Dr. Hendrik Muller's Vaderlandsch Fonds 3aBayesian theory 3aLoxodonta africana 3aagricultural land 3aanimal ecology 3aanimals 3adry season 3ahabitats 3amodels 3amotivation 3apredation 3arisk 3arivers1 aLambert, Ben1 aSonghurst, Anna Catherine1 aMcCulloch, Graham Paul1 aStronza, Amanda Lee1 aCoulson, Tim0 tjournal of animal ecology.g2020 Apr., v. 89, no. 4 p.1055-1068dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl16424x0021-87907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.131773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03119naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002000146245010900166300001800275520171000293592002802003650001002031650002202041650001202063650001402075650001302089650000802102650001102110650001202121650001102133650002102144650002302165650002302188650002002211651001602231653001702247653001002264653001602274653002302290653001502313653001302328653001802341700001802359700001802377700002202395773010702417856008002524852000902604655001202613IND60622261920221120195234.0181124e200711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062226192DNAL7 a10.1177/09596836070824382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStenni, Barbara13aAn oxygen isotope record from the Foscagno rock-glacier ice core, Upper Valtellina, Italian Central Alps  ap. 1033-1039.  aNew high-resolution isotopic records (δ¹⁸O, δD and deuterium excess), from an ice core drilled in the Foscagno rock glacier (Italian Central Alps), are presented. The δ¹⁸O data suggest a clear division between an upper part (2.5 and 4 m), showing relatively homogeneous values, and a middle part (4—7.65 m), showing seasonal variations of this parameter. The isotopic analyses confirm previous results (crystallographic and chemical analyses) suggesting a division of this relict glacier ice body into an upper part, between 2.5 and 4 m, where melting and refreezing processes occur, and a middle part, between 4 and 7.65 m, where the isotopic signal is preserved. Larger deuterium excess variations (d = δD−8*δ ¹⁸O) are found in the massive ice (below 4 m depth) rather than in the overlying ice. These are in antiphase with the δ¹⁸O but without any clear correspondence with the presence of the debris layers. Postdepositional processes could have affected, at least partially, the isotopic content of the original precipitation. The radiocarbon dating of a leaf (Salix spp.) found in the massive ice from another nearby borehole in the same rock glacier gave a calendar age ranging between AD 765 and 1260. The expected δ¹⁸O values of the present-day precipitation in the Foscagno valley are of the same order as those found in the massive ice (−12.4‰). This similarity would suggest climate conditions not very different from present day, in good agreement with other available palaeoclimate reconstructions for this period. However, only more abundant precipitation would make the existence of a glacier possible in a climate not very different from that of the present.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalix 3achemical analysis 3aclimate 3adeuterium 3aglaciers 3aice 3aleaves 3amelting 3aoxygen 3apaleoclimatology 3aradiocarbon dating 3aseasonal variation 3astable isotopes 3aAlps region 0aRock glacier 0aδ18O 0aδD isotope 0arelict glacier ice 0apermafrost 0aHolocene 0aItalian Alps.1 aGenoni, Laura1 aFlora, Onelio1 aGuglielmin, Mauro0 tHolocene.g2007 Nov., v. 17, no. 7 p.1033-1039dSage PublicationswJournal:J000001502x0959-68367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/09596836070824383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01026naa a2200241 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002200138245006600160300001800226520022100244592002800465650002300493650002300516650002100539773013000560856007300690852000900763655001200772IND60657717820221121041520.0190816e20050912xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065771782DNAL7 a10.1039/b508341a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYoshida, Jun-ichi10aFlash chemistry using electrochemical method and microsystems  ap. 4509-4516.  aThis feature article provides a brief outline of the concept of flash chemistry for conducting extremely fast reactions in organic synthesis using electrochemically generated highly reactive species and microsystems.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical compounds 3achemical reactions 3aelectrochemistry0 tChemical communications.g2005 Sept. 12, , no. 36 p.4509-4516dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b508341a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02134naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001700146245004700163300001800210520080700228536012201035592002801157650002101185650001401206650001201220650001001232650000901242650000901251650001101260650001001271650001301281650000901294650001301303650002101316653002301337653002101360653002601381653002201407653001301429700001701442700002001459773010801479856008001587852000901667655001201676IND60614997120221120030232.0181003e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061499712DNAL7 a10.1177/03009858135191342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStern, A.

Four dogs were submitted for postmortem examination, 2 of which were determined to have died prior to the fire. Of the 2 submitted fire fatalities, only 1 dog had burns on its body (dorsum and right side of body). Internally, both dogs had soot deposits mixed with mucus in the larynx, trachea, and primary bronchi. Microscopically, soot was identified within both airways and alveolar spaces.

Herein, we report the self-assembly of a 4-piperazinyl-1,8-naphthalimide based functional block copolymer (PS-b-PN), whose self-assembly and photophysics can be controlled by the stoichiometry-dependent metal–ligand interaction upon the side chain. The work takes advantages of (1) stoichiometry-controlled coordination–structural transformation of the piperazinyl moiety on PS-b-PN toward Fe³⁺ ions, thereby resulting in a shrinkage–expansion conversion of the self-assembled nanostructures in solution as well as in thin film, and (2) stoichiometry–controlled competition between photoinduced electron transfer and spin–orbital coupling process upon naphthalimide fluorophore leading to a boost–decline emission change of the system. Except Fe³⁺ ions, such a stoichiometry-dependent returnable property cannot be observed in the presence of other transition ions. The strategy for realizing the dual-channel sequential response on the basis of the progressively alterable nanomorphologies and emissions might provide deeper insights for the further development of advanced polymeric sensors.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomposite polymers 3aelectron transfer 3aemissions 3afluorescent dyes 3aions 3airon 3amoieties 3ananomaterials 3astoichiometry1 aWu, Hongwei1 aZhu, Mingjie1 aZou, Qi1 aYan, Qiang1 aZhu, Liangliang0 tLangmuir.g2016 June 28, v. 32, no. 25 p.6429-6436dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.langmuir.6b017873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04244naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100006100145245007900206300001600285500001900301500001100320520249500331592002802826596005602854596001902910596005402929596007202983650002403055650001203079650001803091650001903109650001603128650000903144650002503153650001503178650001303193650001703206650001803223650002203241650001603263650001403279651001803293651002603311700002003337700005803357700002603415700006003441773012503501856007903626852000903705655001203714IND60688045520221120122117.0200407e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068804552DNAL7 a10.1111/1365-2656.131532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGeary, William L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6520-689X10aPredator responses to fire: A global systematic review and meta‐analysis  ap. 955-971.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aREVIEW  aKnowledge of how disturbances such as fire shape habitat structure and composition, and affect animal interactions, is fundamental to ecology and ecosystem management. Predators also exert strong effects on ecological communities, through top‐down regulation of prey and competitors, which can result in trophic cascades. Despite their ubiquity, ecological importance and potential to interact with fire, our general understanding of how predators respond to fire remains poor, hampering ecosystem management. To address this important knowledge gap, we conducted a systematic review and meta‐analysis of the effects of fire on terrestrial, vertebrate predators world‐wide. We found 160 studies spanning 1978–2018. There were 36 studies with sufficient information for meta‐analysis, from which we extracted 96 effect sizes (Hedges' g) for 67 predator species relating to changes in abundance indices, occupancy or resource selection in burned and unburned areas, or before and after fire. Studies spanned geographic locations, taxonomic families and study designs, but most were located in North America and Oceania (59% and 24%, respectively), and largely focussed on felids (24%) and canids (25%). Half (50%) of the studies reported responses to wildfire, and nearly one third concerned prescribed (management) fires. There were no clear, general responses of predators to fire, nor relationships with geographic area, biome or life‐history traits (e.g. body mass, hunting strategy and diet). Responses varied considerably between species. Analysis of species for which at least three effect sizes had been reported in the literature revealed that red foxes Vulpes vulpes mostly responded positively to fire (e.g. higher abundance in burned compared to unburned areas) and eastern racers Coluber constrictor negatively, with variances overlapping zero only slightly for both species. Our systematic review and meta‐analysis revealed strong variation in predator responses to fire, and major geographic and taxonomic knowledge gaps. Varied responses of predator species to fire likely depend on ecosystem context. Consistent reporting of ongoing monitoring and management experiments is required to improve understanding of the mechanisms driving predator responses to fire, and any broader effects (e.g. trophic interactions). The divergent responses of species in our study suggest that adaptive, context‐specific management of predator–fire relationships is required.  aPublisher supplied data  cDepartment of Environment, Land, Water and Planning  cParks Victoria  cAlfred Deakin Post‐Doctoral Research Fellowship  cAustralian Research Council Discovery Early Career Researcher Award 3aColuber constrictor 3aFelidae 3aVulpes vulpes 3aanimal ecology 3abody weight 3adiet 3aecosystem management 3aecosystems 3ahabitats 3alife history 3ameta-analysis 3asystematic review 3avertebrates 3awildfires 3aNorth America 3aPacific Ocean Islands1 aDoherty, Tim S.1 aNimmo, Dale G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9814-10091 aTulloch, Ayesha I.

Recolonization of restored waterways by these pollution intolerant insects is frequently employed to measure the success of stream restoration efforts. Post restoration monitoring programs based on recolonization by EPT indicator species are typically generalized with little consideration for local conditions. Within Philadelphia urban development has resulted in a loss of unimpaired headwater streams that might serve as refugia of EPT colonists to replenish downstream populations through passive drift of larvae and ova. In this urban setting, recolonization may depend largely on overland flight by adults from other systems.In an attempt to predict the likelihood of overland dispersal by adult EPT within Philadelphia, PA, USA, a one year field study was conducted at the Schuylkill Center for Environmental Education (SCEE) in Northwest Philadelphia to obtain data on local EPT taxa and dispersal behavior. Adult EPT specimens belonging to 15 species were collected using sticky traps extending laterally from Meig's Run, a 1st order tributary to the Schuylkill River. Leuctra ferruginea (Plecoptera: Leuctridae) was selected as the study species.A random walk model was developed and calibrated to field observations to predict long distance dispersal probability. An individual-based Lévy flight random walk model provided the best fit for field observations from Meig's Run, as well as supporting observations and theory proposed in existing literature.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEphemeroptera 3aLeuctra 3aTrichoptera 3aadults 3aaquatic insects 3adispersal behavior 3aenvironmental education 3aflight 3aindicator species 3alarvae 3amodels 3amonitoring 3aova 3apollution 3aprobability 3arefuge habitats 3arivers 3asticky traps 3astreams 3aurban areas 3aurban development 3awater quality 3awaterways 3aPennsylvania 0aRandom walk model 0aDispersal 0aRecolonization 0aPlecoptera 0aWater quality monitoring 0aStream restoration1 aDapkey, Tanya1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2050-76641 aCruz, Jason0 tEcological informatics.g2014 Jan., v. 19 p.1-9dElsevier B.V.wJournal:2190x1574-95417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2013.11.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03249naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005500150245013400205520157400339592002801913650001101941650001101952650001201963650001901975650001301994650001302007650001102020650001102031650002002042650001602062650002502078650001002103651001702113653002602130653003502156653004302191653003302234653004702267700001802314700002402332700006002356700006102416700006302477700002002540773010102560856008502661852000902746655001202755IND60749379720221120064336.0210926e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074937972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dendro.2021.1258792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDe Mil, Tom1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6207-961312aA lonely dot on the map: Exploring the climate signal in tree-ring density and stable isotopes of clanwilliam cedar, South Africa  aClanwilliam cedar (Widdringtonia cedarbergensis; WICE), a long-lived conifer with distinct tree rings in Cape Province, South Africa, has potential to provide a unique high-resolution climate proxy for southern Africa. However, the climate signal in WICE tree-ring width (TRW) is weak and the dendroclimatic potential of other WICE tree-ring parameters therefore needs to be explored. Here, we investigate the climatic signal in various tree-ring parameters, including TRW, Minimum Density (MND), Maximum Latewood Density (MXD), Maximum Latewood Blue Intensity (MXBI), and stable carbon and oxygen isotopes (δ¹⁸O and δ¹³C) measured in WICE samples collected in 1978. MND was negatively influenced by early spring (October-November) precipitation whereas TRW was positively influenced by spring November-December precipitation. MXD was negatively influenced by autumn (April-May) temperature whereas MXBI was not influenced by temperature. Both MXD and MXBI were negatively influenced by January-March and January-May precipitation respectively. We did not find a significant climate signal in either of the stable isotope time series, which were measured on a limited number of samples. WICE can live to be at least 356 years old and the current TRW chronology extends back to 1564 CE. The development of full-length chronologies of alternative tree-ring parameters, particularly MND, would allow for an annually resolved, multi-century spring precipitation reconstruction for this region in southern Africa, where vulnerability to future climate change is high.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautumn 3acarbon 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aconifers 3alatewood 3aoxygen 3aspring 3astable isotopes 3atemperature 3atime series analysis 3atrees 3aSouth Africa 0aMinimum density (MND) 0aMaximum latewood density (MXD) 0aMaximum latewood blue intensity (MXBI) 0aWiddringtonia cedarbergensis 0aX-ray Computed micro tomography (X-ray CT)1 aMeko, Matthew1 aBelmecheri, Soumaya1 aFebruary, Edmund1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9790-03951 aTherrell, Matthew1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9174-60051 aVan den Bulcke, Jan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2939-54081 aTrouet, Valerie0 tDendrochronologia.g2021 Oct., v. 69 p.125879-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl71157x1125-78657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dendro.2021.1258793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01448naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002600138245010000164300001800264520040800282592002800690650002300718650001100741650002600752650001300778650001200791650001300803700002200816700001900838700002500857700001600882773013000898856007301028852000901101655001201110IND60657718420221121030908.0190816e20050928xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065771842DNAL7 a10.1039/b508424e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStevens, Christian V.10aSynthesis of highly functionalised spiro-indoles by a halogen atom transfer radical cyclization  ap. 4827-4829.  aThe halogen atom transfer radical cyclization (HATRC) has been evaluated on N-(indolylmethyl)trichloroacetamides under Cu(i)Cl catalysis using nitrogen containing ligands.

Decomposition rate is influenced by numerous factors, such as temperature, humidity, litter properties, soil properties, and properties of soil fauna/microbial communities. The aim of this review was to summarize current knowledge on litter decomposition above the treeline in alpine regions worldwide and identify: I) factors that have been studied in great detail, II) factors that have been less intensively investigated, III) geographical regions that have been less well studied, and IV) factors with consistent or inconsistent effects on decomposition. The review showed inconsistent results for all factors covered by two or more studies regarding their effect on decomposition rate (positive, negative, no effect), usually a result of interactions between factors. Studies examining one or several factors in the physical environment (i.e., altitude, experimental warming, microclimate, snow cover and soil moisture) were most common, while studies on different aspects of resource quality were the second most common. The impacts of trophic interactions on soil microbes and fauna were less frequently studied. Europe and Asia were the best-represented regions, in terms of number of studies and geographical distribution, while there were no studies from Africa and very few from South America and Australia. North American studies were all from Colorado, and those from Asia were all from China. In order to obtain better global representation, there is a need for studies in Africa, South America, and Australia. There is also a need for more studies to explain the large variation in responses of litter decomposition rates to different influencing factors in alpine environments. Future research should focus on interactions between different factors and on experiments testing specific relationships, such as the potential interaction between temperature and soil moisture and its effect on litter decomposition above the treeline in alpine regions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaltitude 3acarbon 3aecosystems 3ageographical distribution 3ahumidity 3amicroclimate 3asnowpack 3asoil fauna 3asoil water 3atemperature 3atreeline 3aAfrica 3aAustralia 3aChina 3aColorado 3aEurope 3aSouth America 0aCarbon cycling 0aDecomposers 0aHigh altitude 0aQuality 0aPlant litter 0aSoil organic matter1 aJägerbrand, Annika K.1 aBai, Yang1 aAlatalo, Juha M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5084-850X0 tActa oecologica.g2021 Nov., v. 113 p.103775-dElsevier Masson SASwJournal:2127x1146-609X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actao.2021.1037753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02210naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245015200168300001800320520110700338592002801445650003701473650001501510650001401525650002701539650002801566650001201594650001901606650001901625650001701644700001701661773009901678856008601777852000901863655001201872IND60577483720221119140049.0170809e20160705xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057748372DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.6b006952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Zhanhua10aAntifouling Properties of Fluoropolymer Brushes toward Organic Polymers: The Influence of Composition, Thickness, Brush Architecture, and Annealing  ap. 6571-6581.  aFluoropolymer brushes are widely used to prevent nonspecific adsorption of commercial polymeric or biological materials due to their strongly hydrophobic character. Herein, a series of fluoropolymer brushes with different compositions, thicknesses and molecular architectures was prepared via surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP). Subsequently, the antifouling properties of these fluoropolymer brushes against organic polymers were studied in detail using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements and polystyrene as a representative fouling polymer. Among all of the molecular architectures studied, homopolymerized methacrylate-based fluoropolymer brushes (PMAF17) show the best antifouling properties. Annealing the fluoropolymer brushes improves the antifouling property dramatically due to the reregulated surface composition. These fluoropolymer brushes can be combined with, e.g., micro- and nanostructuring and other advanced materials properties to yield even better long-term antifouling behavior under harsh environments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aadsorption 3aannealing 3aantifouling activities 3aatomic force microscopy 3afouling 3ahydrophobicity 3apolymerization 3apolystyrenes1 aZuilhof, Han0 tLangmuir.g2016 July 05, v. 32, no. 26 p.6571-6581dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.langmuir.6b006953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03036naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245009900164300001400263520178200277592002802059650001902087650001702106650001702123650001602140650001402156650001202170650000902182650001102191650001502202650001202217653000802229653000902237653003002246653001602276653001102292653002402303700002202327700002102349700002602370773010002396856008502496852000902581655001202590IND60538042420221120145649.0190415e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053804242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoinf.2013.11.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBeck, Jan10aSpatial bias in the GBIF database and its effect on modeling species' geographic distributions  ap. 10-15.  aSpecies distribution modeling, in combination with databases of specimen distribution records, is advocated as a solution to the problem of distributional data limitation in biogeography and ecology. The global biodiversity information facility (GBIF), a portal that collates digitized collection and survey data, is the largest online provider of distribution records. However, all distributional databases are spatially biassed due to uneven effort of sampling, data storage and mobilization. Such bias is particularly pronounced in GBIF, where nation-wide differences in funding and data sharing lead to huge differences in contribution to GBIF.We use a common Eurasian butterfly (Aglais urticae) as an exemplar taxon to provide evidence that range model quality is decreasing due to the spatial clustering of distributional records in GBIF. Furthermore, we show that such loss of model quality would go unnoticed with standard methods of model quality evaluation. Using evaluations of model predictions of the Swiss distribution of the species, we compare distribution models of full data with data where a subsampling procedure removes spatial bias at the cost of record numbers, but not of spatial extent of records. We show that data with less spatial bias produce better predictive models even though they are based on less input data. Our subsampling routine may therefore be a suitable method to reduce the impact of spatial bias to species distribution models.Our results warn of automatized applications of species distribution models to distributional databases (as has been advocated and implemented), as internal model evaluation did not show the decline of model quality with increased spatial bias (but rather the opposite) while expert evaluation clearly did.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAglais urticae 3abiodiversity 3abiogeography 3abutterflies 3adatabases 3afunding 3alead 3amodels 3aprediction 3asurveys 0aAUC 0aCSCF 0aEcological niche modeling 0aLepidoptera 0aMaxent 0aSmall tortoiseshell1 aBöller, Marianne1 aErhardt, Andreas1 aSchwanghart, Wolfgang0 tEcological informatics.g2014 Jan., v. 19 p.10-15dElsevier B.V.wJournal:2190x1574-95417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2013.11.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02837naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151242016600174245013100340300001600471520135500487592002801842650001901870650002201889650001501911650001901926650001601945650001001961650001201971650001001983650001401993650001302007650001102020650001302031651001002044653001102054653002702065653001302092653001302105653002002118700002202138773012502160856008502285852000902370655001202379IND60694439620221123002917.0200513e20180315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069443962DNAL7 a10.1080/00218839.2017.13767672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPietropaoli, Marco10aÁcido fórmico líquido al 60% para el control de ácaros varroa (Varroa destructor) en colonias de abejas melíferas (Apis mellifera): protocolo de evaluación10aLiquid formic acid 60% to control varroa mites (Varroa destructor) in honey bee colonies (Apis mellifera): protocol evaluation  ap. 300-307.  aWe verified the acaricide efficacy on Varroa destructor and the toxicity on honey bees of summer treatments carried out in three different apiaries in Central Italy with an evaporator filled with 290 ml of formic acid 60%.

The mean acaricide efficacy varied from a minimum of 57.0 ± 21.8% to a maximum of 72.7 ± 12.5% and resulted always statistically higher with respect to the natural mite fall observed in the untreated groups. Concerning the toxicity for the honey bees, we observed only a statistically significant reduction of sealed brood with respect to the untreated hives in one of the three apiaries. No other statistically significant effects on the hive population or queen mortality could be observed. Environmental temperatures recorded in the three apiaries during the formic acid administration were within the ranges suggested by the evaporator producer. Considering the efficacy and toxicity obtained with the liquid formic acid treatment, the adopted protocol could represent a new sustainable organic tool to control varroa infestation in temperate areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aApis mellifera 3aVarroa destructor 3aacaricides 3aacid treatment 3aformic acid 3ahoney 3aliquids 3amites 3amortality 3aresearch 3asummer 3atoxicity 3aItaly 0avarroa 0aformic acid evaporator 0aefficacy 0aprotocol 0atemperate areas1 aFormato, Giovanni0 tJournal of apicultural research.g2018 Mar. 15, v. 57, no. 2 p.300-307dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12840x2078-69137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00218839.2017.13767673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02128naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002500138245004500163300001800208520100800226592002801234650002301262650002301285650002101308650001701329650000901346650001301355650001901368650002401387650002801411650001901439650001701458650002001475650001601495650002001511773013001531856007201661852000901733655001201742IND60657718720221122131028.0190816e20050920xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065771872DNAL7 a10.1039/b508466k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLicht, S.q(Stuart),10aThermochemical solar hydrogen generation  ap. 4635-4646.  aSolar direct, indirect and hybrid thermochemical processes are presented for the generation of hydrogen and compared to alternate solar hydrogen processes.

Theory and experiment is presented for this process using semiconductor bandgap restrictions and combining photodriven charge transfer, with excess sub-bandgap insolation to lower the water potential, and their combination into highly efficient solar generation of H₂ is attainable. Fundamental water thermodynamics and solar photosensitizer constraints determine solar energy to hydrogen fuel conversion efficiencies in the 50% range over a wide range of insolation, temperature, pressure and photosensitizer bandgap conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical compounds 3achemical reactions 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrolysis 3aheat 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen fuels 3ahydrogen production 3aphotosensitizing agents 3asemiconductors 3asolar energy 3asolar radiation 3atemperature 3awater potential0 tChemical communications.g2005 Sept. 20, , no. 37 p.4635-4646dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b508466k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02331naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245009400170520109700264592002801361650002501389650001901414650001701433650001301450653003401463653002001497653001601517653000901533653001301542653002001555700001801575700001701593700001601610700001301626700001801639700001501657700001701672700001401689773011201703856008501815852000901900655001201909IND60743828720221123035456.0210904e20211015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074382872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.memsci.2021.1195952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSheng, Menglong10aLarge-scale preparation of multilayer composite membranes for post-combustion CO2 capture  aMembrane technology is a promising strategy in flue gas CO₂ capture. Recently, many high-performance multilayer composite membranes for CO₂/N₂ separation were successfully developed in the laboratory. However, the detailed scaling-up processes were rarely discussed due to the lack of mature technology and equipment that specially designed for the proven advanced membrane materials. This study investigated the large-scale production of the defect-free thin multilayer composite membrane for flue gas CO₂ capture. A novel coating machine with double blades and surface cross-linking unit was designed, and the industrial scale multilayer composite membranes were prepared by running the coating machine twice. The coating solution stability of intermediate layer solution was prolonged to more than 72 h. The key technologic parameters including web speed and the concentration of cross-linking unit were analyzed. The continuously prepared multilayer composite membrane shows high and stable CO₂/N₂ performance and great potential in the application of flue gas CO₂ capture.  aPublisher supplied data 3aasymmetric membranes 3acarbon dioxide 3acrosslinking 3aflue gas 0aMultilayer composite membrane 0aCoating machine 0aCO2 capture 0aCCUS 0aScale-up 0aPost-combustion1 aDong, Songlin1 aQiao, Zhihua1 aLi, Qinghua1 aYuan, Ye1 aXing, Guangyu1 aZhao, Song1 aWang, Jixiao1 aWang, Zhi0 tJournal of membrane science.g2021 Oct. 15, v. 636 p.119595-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12468x0376-73887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2021.1195953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02662naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151242008200170245007400252300001600326520083100342592002801173650001201201650001101213650001501224650001001239650001501249650002001264650001401284650001401298650001901312650001201331650002501343650001501368650001201383650001001395650002801405650001501433650001301448650001201461650001001473650001201483650001501495650002001510650000701530650001501537650001101552650001101563650001401574650002001588650001301608650001801621651001201639653002901651653002001680700002501700700001901725700003801744773012401782856008501906852000901991655001202000IND60694440020221120093555.0200513e20180101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069444002DNAL7 a10.1080/00218839.2017.13996632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZerrouk, Salim10aCaracterización de la miel de Ziziphus lotus (azufaifo) producida en Argelia10aCharacterization of Ziziphus lotus (jujube) honey produced in Algeria  ap. 166-174.  aThe characterization of jujube (Ziziphus lotus (L.)

These honeys were characterized by high values of electrical conductivity, potassium, calcium, pH, phenol content, amber color and medium protein content. From the palynological point of view, the honeys had a high pollen content. The presence of some pollen types in the pollen spectra of honeys such as Peganum harmala, Lotus, Eucalyptus, Taraxacum, Cistus, Trifolium, Carduus and Matricaria was proposed as a geographical indicator of this honey type.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCarduus 3aCistus 3aEucalyptus 3aLotus 3aMatricaria 3aPeganum harmala 3aTaraxacum 3aTrifolium 3aZiziphus lotus 3aacidity 3aantioxidant activity 3aapiculture 3acalcium 3acolor 3aelectrical conductivity 3aflavonoids 3afructose 3aglucose 3ahoney 3amaltose 3amelezitose 3amineral content 3apH 3apalynology 3aphenol 3apollen 3apotassium 3aprotein content 3aresearch 3awater content 3aAlgeria 0aphysicochemical analysis 0apollen analysis1 aSeijo, María Carmen1 aEscuredo, Olga1 aRodríguez-Flores, María Shantal0 tJournal of apicultural research.g2018 Jan. 1, v. 57, no. 1 p.166-174dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12840x2078-69137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00218839.2017.13996633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03028naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245008800168300001200256520196100268592002802229650001902257650001802276650001102294650001502305650002202320650002002342650001502362650001302377650002202390650001102412650001202423650002002435700002402455773008502479856008102564852000902645655001202654IND60123882120221119135807.0150411e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012388212DNAL7 a10.1007/s00035-015-0145-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStrebel, Nicolas10aRecent shifts in plant species suggest opposing land-use changes in alpine pastures  ap. 1-9.  aLand abandonment and intensification of management have been suggested as major drivers of biodiversity change in subalpine and alpine grasslands, but the relative importance of these concomitant trends has not been extensively studied. Here, we use plant indicator values to infer patterns of change in the management intensity of summer pastures. Occurrence data of vascular plants from 192 plots surveyed in the Swiss Biodiversity Monitoring BDM programme were used to analyse changes in five species-based indicator values that express the management intensity of sites. Each plot was surveyed twice between 2002 and 2011 with a time span of 5 years between surveys. We looked for an overall trend in management intensity and examined whether a supposed change of management intensity depends on site conditions. In addition, we tested whether a change in indicator values for management intensity accompanies a change in species richness. Over the whole study area, there was no overall change in mean indicator values. However, we found weak but significant relations between changes in mean indicator values and accessibility of the sites. According to plant indicator values, intensification of management takes place at well-accessible and lower-elevation sites, whereas remote sites and sites at higher elevation tend to show a decrease in management intensity. Sites where indicators suggested intensified management showed a decrease of both total species richness and richness of target species relevant for conservation. On the other hand, a supposed decrease in land-use intensity led to an increase in species richness within the surveyed time period. This study confirms that moderate management intensity of summer pastures will best maintain the plant diversity of alpine summer pastures. Because the surveyed plots stem from a rigorously standardized regular-grid sampling, we attribute high reliability and generality to our findings.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabandoned land 3aalpine plants 3abotany 3agrasslands 3aindicator species 3aland use change 3amonitoring 3apastures 3aspecies diversity 3asummer 3asurveys 3avascular plants1 aBühler, Christoph,0 tAlpine botany.g2015 Apr., v. 125, no. 1 p.1-9dSpringer-Verlagx1664-22017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00035-015-0145-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02805naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245016300171300001600334520119500350592002801545650001601573650002701589650002101616650002201637650002001659650001701679650001501696650001801711650001401729650002701743650001301770650001301783650001001796650001601806653002701822653003801849653003101887653002601918653002201944653001401966653001001980653001001990700002002000700002202020700005902042773009102101856008602192852000902278655001202287IND60625771720221123022532.0190131e20190501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062577172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2018.12.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVakh, Christina12aA rotating cotton‐based disk packed with a cation-exchange resin: Separation of ofloxacin from biological fluids followed by chemiluminescence determination  ap. 117-123.  aA novel approach for green and simple solid-phase extraction of ionizable analytes using cation-exchange resin particles packed in a rotating cotton‐based disk has been developed and utilized for the chemiluminescence determination of ofloxacin in biological fluids (serum and urine). The use of highly-available cation-exchange resin provided effective separation of analyte from complex sample matrixes and its elution by aqueous electrolyte solution without any organic solvents. Ofloxacin ionization in acidic sample solution allowed to provide effective separation of the analyte for subsequent chemiluminescence detection. The cotton‐based disk was characterized by effective wettability. This feature promoted high mass transfer of the analyte to the cation-exchange resin surface at separation step and into elution solution at elution step. The sorption time was decreased to 10 min while the elution time was 5 min. Under the optimal conditions, the detector response for ofloxacin was linear in the concentration range from 9 × 10−8 to 3 × 10−5 mol L−1. The limit of detection, calculated from a blank test based on 3σ, was 3 × 10−8 mol L−1.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood serum 3acation exchange resins 3achemical species 3achemiluminescence 3adetection limit 3aelectrolytes 3aionization 3amass transfer 3aofloxacin 3asolid phase extraction 3asolvents 3asorption 3aurine 3awettability 0aSolid-phase extraction 0aRotating-disk sorptive extraction 0aRotating cotton-based disk 0aCation-exchange resin 0aChemiluminescence 0aOfloxacin 0aSerum 0aUrine1 aAlaboud, Marcel1 aLebedinets, Sofya1 aBulatov, Andrey1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0526-14240 tTalanta.g2019 May 01, v. 196 p.117-123dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2018.12.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02994naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245011900170500001900289520161300308592002801921650002201949650002001971650001901991650001202010650001902022650001302041650001302054650000902067650002002076650002102096650001702117650001202134650001402146651001502160653000802175653000802183653002002191700001602211700002302227700002102250700002602271773013302297856008502430852000902515655001202524IND60698491020221117202923.0201104e20201001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069849102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.palaeo.2020.1098452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWorne, Savannah10aReduced upwelling of nutrient and carbon-rich water in the subarctic Pacific during the Mid-Pleistocene Transition  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aReduction in atmospheric pCO₂ has been hypothesised as a causal mechanism for the Mid-Pleistocene Transition (MPT), which saw global cooling and increased duration of glacials between 0.6 and 1.2 Ma. Sea ice-modulated high latitude upwelling and ocean-atmospheric CO₂ flux is considered a potential mechanism for pCO₂ decline, although there are no long-term nutrient upwelling records from high latitude regions to test this hypothesis. Using nitrogen isotopes and opal mass accumulation rates from 0 to 1.2 Ma, we calculate a continuous high resolution nutrient upwelling index for the Bering Sea and assess possible changes to regional CO₂ fluxes and to the relative control of sea ice, sea level and glacial North Pacific Intermediate Water (GNPIW) on deep mixing and nutrient upwelling in the region. We find nutrient upwelling in the Bering Sea correlates with global ice volume and air temperature throughout the study interval. From ~1 Ma, and particularly during the 900 ka event, suppressed nutrient upwelling would have lowered oceanic fluxes of CO₂ to the atmosphere supporting a reduction in global pCO₂ during the MPT. This timing is consistent with a pronounced increase in sea ice during the early Pleistocene and restriction of flow through the Bering Strait during glacials after ~900 ka, both of which would have acted to suppress upwelling. We suggest that sea-level modulated GNPIW expansion during glacials after 900 ka was the dominant control on subarctic Pacific upwelling strength during the mid-late Pleistocene, while sea ice variability played a secondary role.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPleistocene epoch 3aair temperature 3acarbon dioxide 3adecline 3aglobal cooling 3alatitude 3anitrogen 3aopal 3apalaeogeography 3apaleoclimatology 3apaleoecology 3asea ice 3asea level 3aBering Sea 0aMPT 0aCO2 0aUpwelling index1 aKender, Sev1 aSwann, George E.A.1 aLeng, Melanie J.1 aRavelo, Ana Christina0 tPalaeogeography, palaeoclimatology, palaeoecology.g2020 Oct. 01, v. 555 p.109845-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:2694x0031-01827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2020.1098453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02500naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001900112245014100131300001400272500001400286520122800300592002801528650001301556650002901569650000901598650001801607650001501625650001101640650001601651650001101667650001301678650001201691650000701703650001401710650001301724650001401737650001001751650001601761650002201777650001101799653001801810653002601828700001901854700001801873773013001891852000902021655001202030IND60721474620221122131719.0201224e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072147462DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aManpreet Kaur,10aNutritional and physiological requirements for growth and sclerotial formation of Sclerotinia sclerotiorum causing white rot of capsicum  ap. 77-85.  aNAL-light  aSclerotinia sclerotiorum was isolated from infected stems and fruits of capsicum crop grown under green house conditions. Natural, semi-synthetic and synthetic media were evaluated for growth and sclerotial formation by the pathogen. The number of sclerotia as well as rate of colony growth was maximum (29.09mm/day) on potato dextrose agar. The maximum sclerotial size and weight was supported by oat meal agar. Czapek's dox agar induced fastest sclerotial initials formation followed by potato dextrose agar, Richard's agar and french bean seed agar. The optimum temperature for maximum rate of colony growth, length, breadth and cummulative weight of sclerotia per Petri plate was found to be 20°C, whereas, maximum number of sclerotia were formed at 15°C with smaller dimensions and weight compared to those formed at 20°C. Fastest sclerotial initials were observed at 25°C followed by 20°C in case of potato dextrose agar and oat meal agar. Both mycelial growth and sclerotial production decreased with increase in temperature till 30°C. Optimum pH for maximum vegetative growth and sclerotial production of S. sclerotiorum was 5.0, whereas, for getting maximum size of sclerotia, pH 6.0 was found to be optimum.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCapsicum 3aSclerotinia sclerotiorum 3aagar 3aculture media 3adimensions 3afruits 3agreen beans 3alength 3amycelium 3aoatmeal 3apH 3apathogens 3aresearch 3asclerotia 3astems 3atemperature 3avegetative growth 3aweight 0acolony growth 0asclerotial production1 aSingh, Amarjit1 aJain, Sandeep0 tPlant disease research.g2017 June, v. 32, no. 1 p.77-85dIndian Society of Plant PathologistswJournal:2074x2249-87887nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03345naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245013700163300001600300520156000316592002801876650001801904650001501922650001301937650002501950650001901975650001201994650001302006650001602019650001602035650001802051650001702069650001602086650002402102650001802126650000902144650003102153650001502184650002202199650003302221650001502254653001302269653002202282653002302304653001602327653001902343700001702362700005402379700001602433700005402449700001702503700001802520773012502538856008302663852000902746655001202755IND60672941320221122054940.0200228e20200215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067294132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2019.10.0452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheng, Hua10aMulti-functional magnetic bacteria as efficient and economical Pickering emulsifiers for encapsulation and removal of oil from water  ap. 349-358.  aEffective removal of oil pollutants from the surface of water is important in oil-polluted environments. Since living microorganisms can be used as particle-stabilizers for oil emulsification, magnet-responsive oil-degrading bacteria (M-Bacteria) are expected to integrate three intriguing properties, such as Pickering emulsification, magnet-responsiveness and bioactivity. Hence, by acting as an efficient Pickering emulsifier to encapsulate oil pollutants, it should be possible to eliminate oil from water under the application of an external magnetic field.Oil-degrading bacteria, Brevibacillus parabrev, were successfully coated with a shell of magnetic Fe₃O₄ nanoparticles using polycations. The morphology and physicochemical characteristics of M-Bacteria were characterized by various techniques. A systematic study on Pickering emulsification of M-Bacteria and the removal of five types of oils were performed. Specific adsorption of M-Bacteria at the oil droplet surface was observed through optical, fluorescence, and scanning electronic microscopy images. The biodegradation process of oil was monitored using gas chromatography.Eco-friendly M-Bacteria not only acts as an effective particle emulsifier to realize encapsulation and magnetic separation of oil contaminants but also shows a strong ability for further conversion of oil. This is the first report of oil removal via Pickering emulsification of living bacterial cells, which shows the potential of bacterial cells as functional colloidal materials in treating oily wastewater.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrevibacillus 3aadsorption 3abacteria 3abioactive properties 3abiodegradation 3acations 3adroplets 3aemulsifiers 3aemulsifying 3aencapsulation 3afluorescence 3airon oxides 3amagnetic separation 3ananoparticles 3aoils 3aphysicochemical properties 3apollutants 3apollution control 3ascanning electron microscopy 3awastewater 0aBacteria 0aMagnetic-response 0aPickering emulsion 0aOil removal 0aBiodegradation1 aLi, Zhiqiang1 aLi, Yiming1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3855-10621 aShi, Zhixin1 aBao, Mutai1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1595-47691 aHan, Changbo1 aWang, Zhining0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2020 Feb. 15, v. 560 p.349-358dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2019.10.0453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03966naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024001700135024002300152024003500175024002300210024004000233024002500273040001800298100006200316245016500378300001200543506007600555520167300631592002802304506003702332650002802369650002102397650002602418650001902444650002902463650001602492650001302508650001902521650001502540650002002555650001402575650001002589650002002599650001702619650001102636650002302647650001902670650001802689650003502707650001202742650002102754650000802775650001302783700006502796700002102861700002502882700002702907700002202934773010602956856011403062856008203176961001303258852000903271655001203280IND60679507320221214225908.0200821e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067950732DNAL7 a318643192pmid7 aPMC69258762pmcid7 a3660992aris7 a10113/67950732hdl7 a10.1186/s12896-019-0594-72doi7 a3660992seq_no_1157 a8042-22000-295-00D2aris_project_no7 a4305932aris_accn_no  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHammond, Rosemarie1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5815-665510aOptimized production of a biologically active Clostridium perfringens glycosyl hydrolase phage endolysin PlyCP41 in plants using virus-based systemic expression  ap. 101.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Clostridium perfringens, a gram-positive, anaerobic, rod-shaped bacterium, is the third leading cause of human foodborne bacterial disease and a cause of necrotic enteritis in poultry. It is controlled using antibiotics, widespread use of which may lead to development of drug-resistant bacteria. Bacteriophage-encoded endolysins that degrade peptidoglycans in the bacterial cell wall are potential replacements for antibiotics. Phage endolysins have been identified that exhibit antibacterial activities against several Clostridium strains. RESULTS: An Escherichia coli codon-optimized gene encoding the glycosyl hydrolase endolysin (PlyCP41) containing a polyhistidine tag was expressed in E. coli. In addition, The E. coli optimized endolysin gene was engineered for expression in plants (PlyCP41p) and a plant codon-optimized gene (PlyCP41pc), both containing a polyhistidine tag, were expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana plants using a potato virus X (PVX)-based transient expression vector. PlyCP41p accumulated to ~ 1% total soluble protein (100μg/gm f. wt. leaf tissue) without any obvious toxic effects on plant cells, and both the purified protein and plant sap containing the protein lysed C. perfringens strain Cp39 in a plate lysis assay. Optimal systemic expression of PlyCP41p was achieved at 2 weeks-post-infection. PlyCP41pc did not accumulate to higher levels than PlyCP41p in infected tissue. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that functionally active bacteriophage PlyCP41 endolysin can be produced in systemically infected plant tissue with potential for use of crude plant sap as an effective antimicrobial agent against C. perfringens.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aClostridium perfringens 3aEscherichia coli 3aNicotiana benthamiana 3aPotato virus X 3aantibacterial properties 3aantibiotics 3abacteria 3abacteriophages 3acell walls 3adrug resistance 3aendolysin 3agenes 3agenetic vectors 3aglycosidases 3aleaves 3anecrotic enteritis 3apeptidoglycans 3aplant tissues 3aplant-incorporated protectants 3apoultry 3apoultry diseases 3asap 3atoxicity1 aHammond, Rosemarie W.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5815-66551 aSwift, Steven M.1 aFoster-Frey, Juli A.1 aKovalskaya, Natalia Y.1 aDonovan, David M.0 tBMC biotechnology.g2019 Dec., v. 19, no. 1 p.101-101dBioMed CentralwJournal:19124x1472-67507nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/67950733Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12896-019-0594-73Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle01562naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002300138245009300161300001600254520029700270592002800567650001300595650002100608650002800629650001900657650002700676650002300703650001200726650001300738650002700751650001800778650001000796700002000806700002200826700002000848700002300868700001800891700001800909773013100927856007301058852000901131655001201140IND60658480420221120200733.0190826e20091215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065848042DNAL7 a10.1039/b910601d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVijayaraghavan, R.10aBiocompatibility of choline salts as crosslinking agents for collagen based biomaterials  ap. 294-296.  aA series of novel choline based salts, some of which can be described as ionic liquids, are prepared and evaluated for their biocompatibility; when combined with collagenous biomaterials they exhibit good cell viability and adhesion properties as required for biomedical implant applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3abiocompatibility 3abiocompatible materials 3acell viability 3achemical communication 3achemical reactions 3acholine 3acollagen 3across-linking reagents 3aionic liquids 3asalts1 aThompson, B.

Fresh pork meat was purchased from a local market and stored at 10 °C for 1–15 days. In total, 59 samples were used in this study, and three to four samples were taken out randomly for hyperspectral scattering imaging and conventional microbiological analysis on each day of the experiment. Both the Lorentzian function and the Gompertz function were exploited to interpret the scattering profiles of pork meat samples, and good fitting results were obtained between 472 and 1,000 nm. Stepwise multiple linear regression (SMLR) method was performed to establish the prediction models, and moving average method with the filter size ranging from 3-point to 15-point was applied to improve the modeling results, respectively. Among the models established, the models developed by the Lorentzian parameter b and the Gompertz parameter β performed best for predicting pork meat TVC, with the correlation coefficient of validation set (Rv) of 0.94 and 0.93, respectively, after 13-point and 11-point moving average. The Lorentzian parameter a and the Gompertz parameters α and δ can also give good prediction results, with Rv of 0.83, 0.88, and 0.82, respectively. The results demonstrated that hyperspectral scattering imaging combined with the Lorentzian function and the Gompertz function can be a powerful tool for evaluating the microbial safety of meat in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3abacterial contamination 3abioprocessing 3acorrelation 3afood safety 3aimage analysis 3alinear models 3amarkets 3anondestructive methods 3apork 3aprediction1 aPeng, Yankun0 tFood and bioprocess technology.g2015 Jan., v. 8, no. 1 p.17-30dSpringer-Verlagx1935-51307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11947-014-1374-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03264naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100006100188245012500249300001200374506007600386520176200462592002802224506003702252650002502289650002002314650002802334650001702362650001402379650002402393650001402417650001402431650002002445650001302465651001402478700001502492700001802507700001502525700002002540700002402560773013102584856008202715852000902797655001202806IND60679507520221207092507.0201028e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067950752DNAL7 a318643272pmid7 aPMC69258952pmcid7 a10.1186/s12906-019-2788-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWaddington, Freya1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4280-240210aComplementary medicine use among Australian patients in an acute hospital setting: an exploratory, cross sectional study  ap. 374.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: The use of Complementary Medicines (CMs) has significantly increased in Australia over the last decade. This study attempts to determine the extent to which complementary and alternative medicines are recorded, ceased or initiated in the acute hospital setting and investigate which health professionals have a role in this process. METHODS: A cross-sectional study of inpatients was conducted at a major tertiary teaching hospital. Patient’s medical records were examined to determine the rates of complementary medicine (CM) use and recording on medication charts and discharge prescriptions. Patient progress notes were audited to determine which health professionals were involved with the initiation or cessation of CMs during the inpatient stay. RESULTS: Three hundred and forty-one patients were included for analysis of which 44.3% (n = 151) participants were recorded as utilizing a CM. Patients were admitted on a mean of 2 (±1.4[Sd]; 0–9[range]) CMs and discharged on a mean of 1.7 CMs (±1.3[Sd]; 0–5[range]). 274 individual CMs were recorded on inpatient medication reconciliation forms with multivitamins, magnesium, fish oil and cholecalciferol recorded the most frequently. One hundred and fifty-eight changes to patient CM usage were recorded during the patient hospitalisation. One hundred and seven of these changes (68%) were not accounted for in the patient progress notes. CONCLUSION: Patients use of CM in this hospital setting do not reflect the national estimated usage. On the occasions that CM products are included in patient records, they are subsequently deprescribed following patient examination in hospital. It is currently unclear which health professionals have a role in this deprescribing process.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aalternative medicine 3acholecalciferol 3across-sectional studies 3adrug therapy 3afish oils 3ahealth care workers 3ahospitals 3amagnesium 3amedical records 3apatients 3aAustralia1 aLee, Jenny1 aNaunton, Mark1 aKyle, Greg1 aThomas, Jackson1 aO’Kane, Gabrielle0 tBMC complementary and alternative medicine.g2019 Dec., v. 19, no. 1 p.374-374dBioMed CentralwJournal:21388x1472-68827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12906-019-2788-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03698naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006100148245015200209300001200361500001900373520195400392592002802346596005402374596004602428596007702474596007702551596007702628650001202705650001102717650001602728650001102744650002202755650002102777650001702798650001702815651001102832700002402843700002002867700002702887700002102914700003202935700003002967773013902997856008303136852000903219655001203228IND60712271420221118060820.0201112e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071227142DNAL7 a10.1007/s00265-020-02894-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDanel, Dariusz P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6175-392810aSex differences in ocular morphology in Caucasian people: a dubious role of sexual selection in the evolution of sexual dimorphism of the human eye  ap. 115.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe horizontal size of the exposed depigmented sclera in Caucasians has been previously suggested to be sexually dimorphic, and the significance of this phenomenon remains unclear. Here we build on a previous study and extend it by (i) examining sex differences in other measures of ocular morphology and (ii) exploring the link between eye morphology and biometric markers of facial attractiveness. We used facial photographs of 100 Caucasians (50 men) from Eastern-Central Europe and digitally measured four ocular features. Eye measurements were tested for sex differences and associations with morphometric data on facial averageness and sexual shape dimorphism. We found that sclera surface is more horizontally exposed in men, even though the total surface area is similar in both sexes. We also found that eye fissures are rounder (less rectangular) in women than in men and that irises are brighter in women. We did not find any relationship between the examined eye features and two aspects of facial attractiveness: facial averageness and sexual dimorphism in facial shape. Despite being sexually dimorphic, eye features may be loosely linked with the development of facial sexual ornamentation. The role of sexual selection in the evolution of the observed phenomena is disputable. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: It is often argued that because of their physical appearance, human eyes are crucial to interpersonal and social interactions. In many aspects, however, the significance of the human eye architecture is unclear. In this study, we examine sex differences in eye morphology and explore the link between ocular features and biometric measures of facial attractiveness in Caucasian men and women. We found that despite being sexually dimorphic, eye features may be loosely linked with biometric markers of facial attractiveness. We argue that the role of sexual selection in the evolution of the observed sex differences is disputable.  aPublisher supplied data  aGA18-10298ScGrantová Agentura České Republiky  a# 804582cH2020 European Research Council  aPPI/APM/2018/1/00036/U/001cPolish National Agency for Academic Exchange  aPPI/APM/2018/1/00036/U/001cPolish National Agency for Academic Exchange  aPPI/APM/2018/1/00036/U/001cPolish National Agency for Academic Exchange 3aecology 3ahumans 3amorphometry 3asclera 3asexual dimorphism 3asexual selection 3asociobiology 3asurface area 3aEurope1 aWacewicz, Sławomir1 aKleisner, Karel1 aLewandowski, Zdzisław1 aKret, Mariska E.1 aŻywiczyński, Przemysław,1 aPerea-Garcia, Juan Olvido0 tBehavioral ecology and sociobiology.g2020 Oct., v. 74, no. 10 p.115-115dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl6766x0340-54437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00265-020-02894-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02755naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245011600169300001600285520135700301592002801658650000801686650001501694650001301709650001601722650002001738650001501758650001001773650002201783650001401805650001901819650002701838650004701865653001801912653002201930653001401952653001201966653003401978653004502012700002102057700002602078773010002104856008402204852000902288655001202297IND60122532920221119162631.0150325e20140403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012253292DNAL7 a10.1080/12538078.2014.9057992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYahia, Yassine10aGenetic diversity of Vicia faba L. based on random amplified polymorphic DNA and simple sequence repeat markers  ap. 151-158.  aThe genetic diversity of 13 Tunisian faba bean (Vicia faba L.) accessions, and the commercial variety “Aguadulce”, were studied using simple sequence repeats (SSRs) and random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers. In comparison to RAPD markers, SSRs showed a higher level of polymorphism and greater information content, as assessed by the expected heterozygosity. One hundred and fourteen bands were amplified using six SSR primer combinations and 376 bands were observed using four RAPD primers. The percentages of polymorphic fragments were 100% and 60.63% for SSR and RAPD markers, respectively. The polymorphism information content, gene diversity and population differentiation test were 0.370, 0.490 and 0.746, respectively, for SSR markers and 0.319, 0.406 and 0.775 for RAPD markers. The correlation coefficients of similarity based on the Mantel test were statistically significant for the both marker systems used, but were higher for SSR data than for RAPD. Dendrogram topologies, conducted separately on polymorphic RAPD and SSR markers, showed minor differences in the grouping of accessions. The dendrogram based on combined RAPD and SSR data sets identified clustering of accessions according to their geographic diffusion. Collectively, these results will aid Tunisian faba bean germplasm management, conservation and breeding.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aVicia faba 3abreeding 3acorrelation 3adata collection 3afaba beans 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3agermplasm 3aheterozygosity 3amicrosatellite repeats 3arandom amplified polymorphic DNA technique 0aVicia faba L. 0agenetic diversity 0agermplasm 0aTunisia 0asimple sequence repeat marker 0arandom amplified polymorphism DNA marker1 aHannachi, Hédia1 aFerchichi, A.q(Ali),0 tActa botanica Gallica.g2014 Apr. 3, v. 161, no. 2 p.151-158dTaylor & Francisx2166-34087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/12538078.2014.9057993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02778naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001400146245008500160300002000245520121500265592002801480650004401508650003701552650001501589650001501604650001501619650003701634650001801671650001101689650000701700650002201707650001901729650003301748650001601781650001901797650002101816650001201837700001601849700001701865700001401882700001301896700001801909700001501927700001601942700005201958773017302010856008002183852000902263655001202272IND60626742120221120061923.0181226e20181203xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062674212DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.8b035092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Fuqiu10aAdsorption of Low-Concentration Uranyl Ion by Amidoxime Polyacrylonitrile Fibers  ap. 17384-17393.  aAmidoxime polyacrylonitrile fibers (PAO fibers) were prepared with polyacrylonitrile fibers (PAN fibers) and hydroxylamine hydrochloride through a heterogeneous reaction, which were used for low-concentration uranyl ion adsorption (under 1 mg/L). The as-prepared PAO fibers were characterized using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), thermalgravimetric analysis (TGA), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements. Batch adsorption experiments were conducted to explore the best adsorbent concentration, pH, contact time, and temperature. When the adsorbent concentration reaches 0.1 g/L to dispose of a uranium solution of 100 μg/L, the equilibrium concentration can be decreased under 10 μg/L. The optimum pH for this adsorption experiment is 5.0, and the adsorption can reach equilibrium in 8 h under 298 K. The adsorption process fit well with the intraparticle diffusion model and pseudo-second-order model. In addition, Langmuir, Freundlich, Temkin, and Dubinin–Radushkevich (D-R) models were used to explain the adsorption thermodynamic process. The adsorption process is spontaneous and endothermic.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aendothermy 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3ahydroxylamine 3amodels 3apH 3apolyacrylonitrile 3aprocess design 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atemperature 3athermodynamics 3athermogravimetry 3auranium1 aDong, Boran1 aGui, Yunyang1 aCao, Meng1 aHan, Lei1 aJiao, Caishan1 aLv, Huitao1 aHou, Junjun1 aXue, Yun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2842-21390 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2018 Dec. 03, v. 57, no. 51 p.17384-17393dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.8b035093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01627naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002800166245006500194300001800259520029300277592002800570650001000598650001800608650001600626650001600642650002300658650003500681650001200716650001800728650002900746650001300775650001100788650002400799650004000823650003900863650003600902650001700938700001900955773009400974856008101068990002301149852000901172655001201181IND60093938120221117160145.0141104e20120724xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009393812DNAL7 a228357932pmid7 a10.1016/j.cub.2012.06.0482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSullivan-Brown, Jessica10aNeural Tube Closure: The Curious Case of Shrinking Junctions  ap.

The aim of the present study was to develop a root rot resistance index for Scots pine breeding and evaluate its effectiveness. The productivity, branch diameter, branchiness, stem straightness, spike knots, and damage from natural infection of root rot in 154 Scots pine open-pollinated families from Latvia were evaluated through a progeny field trial at the age of 38 years. Trees with decline symptoms were sampled for fungal isolations. Based on this information and kriging estimates of root rot, 35 affected areas (average size: 108 m²; total 28% from the 1.5 ha trial) were delineated. Resistance index of a single tree was formed based on family adjusted proportion of live to infected trees and distance to the center of affected area. Heritability for resistance to root rot based on the value of this index, was high (0.37) and comparable to indices of growth traits. Correlations of family breeding estimates between resistance to root rot and the other traits were not significant, except for a weak, yet significant, positive correlation with diameter at breast height and branch diameter. Selection index including only growth traits (height and stem volume) had a negligible effect on damage by root rot. We detected a maximum genetic gain in resistance index of 33.7% when incorporating it into the selection index with positive gains for growth traits (6.5–11.0%). Two-stage selection with prior selection of the most resistant families was not superior to the use of selection index with only rot resistance included. Overall; rot resistance index appeared to be an effective tool in tree breeding for the selection of more resistant families, using the existing trials with natural (uncontrolled) infection  aPublisher supplied data 3aHeterobasidion annosum 3aPinus sylvestris 3adecline 3adisease resistance 3aenvironmental factors 3afield experimentation 3aforest trees 3afungi 3agenetic improvement 3agrowth traits 3aheritability 3aknots 3akriging 3aopen pollination 3aprogeny 3aroot rot 3aselection index 3atree and stand measurements 3atree breeding 3atree diseases 3aLatvia1 aZeltiņš, Pauls 1 aBaliuckas, Virgilijus 1 aBrūna, Lauma 1 aZaļuma, Astra 1 aKāpostiņš, Rolands 0 tForests.g2019 Dec. 22, v. 11, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f110100233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03735naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100007300150245014100223300001600364500001900380520245700399592002802856650001202884650001602896650002602912650002102938653002102959653004102980653002603021653003303047653004203080700005703122773011203179856008503291852000903376655001203385IND60705655920221119061315.0201216e20201220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070565592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.quaint.2020.06.0462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartín-Viveros, Juan Ignacio1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9354-641310aUsing 3D digital microscopy and SEM-EDX for in-situ residue analysis: A multi-analytical contextual approach on experimental stone tools  ap. 228-262.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aResidue analysis is a sub-discipline in archaeology that uses a variety of techniques which can be useful for determining the function of prehistoric stone tools. Past experimental studies have revealed the non-diagnostic nature of residues under reflected light microscopy and the challenges of identifying them as plant or animal and assigning them to a specific origin (i.e. use-related vs incidental). Recently, new contextual approaches and analytical techniques have addressed these limitations. Prior studies have suggested that use-related and incidental residues can be identified on stone tool surfaces based on differences in distribution patterns. Location, residue frequency, and associations with other residues are often the main criteria used in these studies to distinguish use-related from incidental residues, while other contextual information such as directionality, aspects of crushing and smearing, or dispersion from the working edge are often ignored. Moreover, the integration of chemical information provided by other analytical techniques into these contextual approaches that address residue mapping has received little attention. In this study, we address these issues and combine contextual information recorded through 3D digital microscopy with elemental compositions obtained through SEM-EDX to better identify different animal and plant residues on experimental stone tools. Based on an experimental sample tested under outdoor field conditions, we show how identification issues in fresh undamaged residues are not only restricted to the ambiguity between different use-related remains, but also the ambiguity between the latter and incidental residues. We demonstrate the versatility of 3D DM in recording in-situ contextual information of fresh residues (distribution patterns, invasiveness, disposition of specific tissues indicating tool-use direction, and aspects of crushing and smearing) and how supporting this information with the elemental composition obtained through SEM-EDX and element maps can help to improve identification of ambiguous residues, both use-related and incidental. Although more experiments are needed, the multi-analytical contextual approach tested here provides an example of in-situ characterization of fresh undamaged residues in experimental tools that can be conducted before performing post-depositional experiments or using other analytical techniques and extraction protocols.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimals 3aarchaeology 3aelemental composition 3alight microscopy 0aResidue analysis 0aMulti-analytical contextual approach 0a3D digital microscopy 0aScanning electron microscopy 0aEnergy dispersive X-rays spectroscopy1 aOllé, Andreu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8643-55360 tQuaternary international.g2020 Dec. 20, v. 569-570 p.228-262dElsevier LtdwJournal:12411x1040-61827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2020.06.0463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02917naa a2200709 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245014100165300001600306520096600322592002801288650001601316650001801332650003101350650002601381650001901407650001101426650001701437650002401454650001301478650001901491653000701510653000801517653000901525653000901534653000801543653000901551653001001560653000901570653000801579653000801587653000801595653000801603653000901611653000801620653000901628653000901637653000801646653000701654653000901661653000801670653000801678653002601686653000901712653001601721653005101737653001901788653003901807700002601846700002301872700002501895700001701920700005601937773011101993856008202104852000902186655001202195IND60527302920221120154628.0190415e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052730292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jff.2016.02.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHerz, Corinna10aBenzyl isothiocyanate but not benzyl nitrile from Brassicales plants dually blocks the COX and LOX pathway in primary human immune cells  ap. 135-143.  aThe main products formed from glucosinolates from Brassicales plants are isothiocyanates (ITCs) and nitriles. ITCs are known for their diverse bioactive potential, knowledge about the bioactivity of food-borne nitriles is poor, though. Anti-inflammation by benzyl ITC (BITC) and its nitrile has not so far been studied in human immune cells. Here, the potential of BITC to inhibit the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced inflammatory response in human peripheral mononuclear blood cells (PBMC) was analysed in comparison to benzyl nitrile (BCN).Our data show that BITC strongly interferes with the cellular pro-inflammatory response in terms of dual COX and LOX pathway inhibition and reduced the activation and function of activated T lymphocytes. In contrast, BCN did not influence prostaglandin PGE2 release from PBMC. The inactivity of the glucosinolate product BCN must be considered when Brassicales plants are intended for use against inflammatory diseases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrassicales 3aT-lymphocytes 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3abenzyl isothiocyanate 3aglucosinolates 3ahumans 3ainflammation 3alipopolysaccharides 3anitriles 3aprostaglandins 0aAA 0aBCN 0aBITC 0aCFSE 0aCOX 0aDMSO 0aELISA 0afMLP 0aGLS 0aITC 0aLOX 0aLPS 0aLTB4 0amAB 0aMAPK 0aPBMC 0aPBS 0aPE 0aPeCN 0aPGE 0aPMA 0aBenzyl isothiocyanate 0aBITC 0aBrassicales 0aAnti-inflammatory effect in primary human PBMC 0aBenzyl nitrile 0aDual LOX and COX pathway inhibitor1 aMárton, Melinda-Rita1 aTran, Hoai Thi Thu1 aGründemann, Carsten1 aSchell, Jana1 aLamy, Evelyn1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5620-15950 tJournal of functional foods.g2016 May, v. 23 p.135-143dElsevier LtdwJournal:J000000142x1756-46467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jff.2016.02.0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03118naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004600113024003500159040001800194100002300212245014500235300001600380506007600396520155400472592002802026506003702054650002202091650001402113650003802127650001402165650001902179650001902198650002302217650002002240650001402260650003402274650002402308650002002332650002202352651001002374700002602384700002402410700002002434773010402454856008102558852000902639655001202648IND60082055920221207144917.0141016e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008205592DNAL7 a253204872pmid7 aPMC4185043 [Available on 12/01/15]2pmcid7 a10.1007/s12639-013-0257-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMetwally, Asmaa M.10aMicroscopical and serological studies on Sarcocystis infection with first report of S. cruzi in buffaloes (Bubalus bubalis) in Assiut, Egypt  ap. 378-382.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThis study was performed for the purpose of investigating the prevalence and the species composition of Sarcocystis spp. in buffaloes in Assiut province, Egypt. Macroscopically we reported the infection of buffaloes with Sarcocystis fusiformis, while microscopically three Sarcocystis species (Sarcocystis cruzi, Sarcocystis levinei and Sarcocystis hominis) cysts were recognized, and were differentiated by their morphological features using both histopathological sections and electron microscope scanning. Regarding the prevalence of Sarcocystis species among buffaloes in Assiut province, we reported that, using gross examination of 90 buffaloes’ esophagus, only 23 samples out of 90 (25.5 %) were found to be infected; on the other hand, by using microscopical examination, the prevalence was 27.7 % (25 samples out of 90 samples were found to be infected). Using ELISA, 85 samples out of 90 (94.4 %) were found positive, an overall prevalence of 94.4 %. In this work we concluded that customary meat inspection methods in abattoirs in Egypt are insufficient for detecting Sarcocystis infection. Due to the presence of hidden or microscopic cysts, we strongly recommend the use of combined microscopical examination and ELISA for Sarcocystis diagnosis, to avoid human infection of such zoonotic parasite and to control the consequent disease. In addition, this study introduced the first report of S. cruzi in buffaloes in Egypt, and proved the hypothesis that S. cruzi is able to use animals such as water buffalo as intermediate hosts.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSarcocystis cruzi 3abuffaloes 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aesophagus 3ahistopathology 3ahuman diseases 3aintermediate hosts 3ameat inspection 3aparasites 3ascanning electron microscopes 3aserological surveys 3aslaughterhouses 3aspecies diversity 3aEgypt1 aAbd Ellah, Mahmoud R.1 aAL-Hosary, Amira A.1 aOmar, Mosaab A.0 tJournal of parasitic diseases.g2014 Dec., v. 38, no. 4 p.378-382dSpringer-Verlagx0971-71967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12639-013-0257-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02840naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003900133040001800172100002200190245008900212300001800301506007600319520118400395592002801579506003701607650002501644650001901669650002201688650001101710650004201721650001101763650001801774650000901792650002501801650001801826650001501844650002501859650001201884650003001896650005101926650001101977650000901988650002901997650003602026650001302062700002302075700002002098700001702118773010202135856005202237852000902289655001202298IND4488221620221207114229.0120423e20120415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448822162DNAL7 a223682432pmid7 aPMC33245152pmcid7 a10.1093/bioinformatics/bts0942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchulz, Marcel H.10aOases: robust de novo RNA-seq assembly across the dynamic range of expression levels  ap. 1086-1092.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMOTIVATION: High-throughput sequencing has made the analysis of new model organisms more affordable. Although assembling a new genome can still be costly and difficult, it is possible to use RNA-seq to sequence mRNA. In the absence of a known genome, it is necessary to assemble these sequences de novo, taking into account possible alternative isoforms and the dynamic range of expression values. RESULTS: We present a software package named Oases designed to heuristically assemble RNA-seq reads in the absence of a reference genome, across a broad spectrum of expression values and in presence of alternative isoforms. It achieves this by using an array of hash lengths, a dynamic filtering of noise, a robust resolution of alternative splicing events and the efficient merging of multiple assemblies. It was tested on human and mouse RNA-seq data and is shown to improve significantly on the transABySS and Trinity de novo transcriptome assemblers.

Merr.] and winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is the most popular crop rotation in the USA. Field experiments were conducted from 1984 to 1989 to evaluate alternate cropping systems for a Tunica clay soil (clayey over loamy, montmorillonitic, nonacid, thermic Vertic Haplaquept) in the lower Mississippi River Valley. Specific objectives were to (i) determine the seed yield response of monocrop soybean and doublecrop soybean and wheat grown in rotation in irrigated and nonirrigated environments, and (ii) determine the increase in gross income for soybean due to irrigation. Seed yields of monocrop soybean averaged over the 6-yr test period exceeded yield from doublecrop soybean in the irrigated (41.3 vs. 32.5 bu/acre) and nonirrigated (18.0 vs. 9.2 bu/acre) environments, respectively. Yields of soybean from corn (Zea mays L.)/wheat-soybean and sorghum [Sorghum bi-color (L.) Moench.]/wheat-soybean rotations were similar in the irrigated and in the nonirrigated experiments. Average wheat yields from the wheat-soybean, corn/wheat-soybean, and sorghum/wheat-soybean systems indicated no great advantage for any system. Irrigation of soybean increased yields and gross income in all years except 1989. Gross income and returns per inch of irrigation water varied considerably across years, however, and were a function of commodity prices and the amount of irrigation water applied.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGlycine max 3aTriticum aestivum 3awinter wheat 3aZea mays 3aSorghum bicolor 3adouble cropping 3acontinuous cropping 3acrop rotation 3aclay soils 3airrigated conditions 3adry environmental conditions 3acrop yield 3aseeds 3aincome1 aHeatherly, Larry G.1 aElmore, C.

Gaertn.] is grown mainly by subsistence farmers in arid and semiarid regions of the world. To broaden its genetic base and to boost its production, it is of paramount importance to characterize and genotype the diverse gene pool of this important food and nutritional security crop. However, as a result of nonavailability of the genome sequence of finger millet, the progress could not be made in realizing the molecular basis of unique qualities of the crop. In the present investigation, attempts have been made to characterize the genetically diverse collection of 113 finger millet accessions through whole‐genome genotyping‐by‐sequencing (GBS), which resulted in a genome‐wide set of 23,000 single‐nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) segregating across the entire collection and several thousand SNPs segregating within every accession. A model‐based population structure analysis reveals the presence of three subpopulations among the finger millet accessions, which are in parallel with the results of phylogenetic analysis. The observed population structure is consistent with the hypothesis that finger millet was domesticated first in Africa, and from there it was introduced to India some 3000 yr ago. A total of 1128 gene ontology (GO) terms were assigned to SNP‐carrying genes for three main categories: biological process, cellular component, and molecular function. Facilitated access to high‐throughput genotyping and sequencing technologies are likely to improve the breeding process in developing countries, and as such, this data will be very useful to breeders who are working for the genetic improvement of finger millet.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEleusine coracana 3adeveloping countries 3afarmers 3afood security 3agene ontology 3agene pool 3agenes 3agenetic background 3agenetic improvement 3agenotyping by sequencing 3agermplasm 3anucleotide sequences 3aphylogeny 3aplant breeding 3apopulation structure 3asemiarid zones 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3aAfrica 3aIndia1 aSharma, Divya1 aTiwari, Apoorv1 aJaiswal, J.P.1 aSingh, N.K.1 aSood, Salej0 tThe plant genome.g2016 July, v. 9, no. 2 p.eplantgenome2015.07.0058-dCrop Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl4288766x1940-33727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3835/plantgenome2015.07.00583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03238naa a2200829 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003700147245011800184300001600302520103300318592002801351650002101379650001501400650001701415650001601432650003101448650001801479650001601497650002001513650001001533650001701543650001101560650001101571650001801582650000901600650002101609650001601630650002601646650003201672653000801704653001001712653001201722653000901734653000801743653001001751653000801761653000901769653001101778653000901789653000901798653001101807653000901818653000801827653000801835653001001843653001101853653001001864653000801874653001201882653000801894653001201902653001101914653001101925653003001936653001701966653002501983653002802008653002602036653002102062700003602083700002202119700002102141700003202162773011102194856008202305852000902387655001202396IND60527303220221116235833.0190415e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052730322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jff.2016.02.0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartino, Hércia Stampini Duarte10aAnti-lipidaemic and anti-inflammatory effect of açai (Euterpe oleracea Martius) polyphenols on 3T3-L1 adipocytes  ap. 432-443.  aThe anti-lipidaemic and anti-inflammatory effects of açai polyphenols in 3T3-L1 mouse adipocytes were investigated. Pre-adipocytes were differentiated with and without açai-polyphenols at concentrations of 2.5, 5 and 10 µg gallic acid equivalents (GAE)/mL. Results showed that açai polyphenols reduce the accumulation of intracellular lipids in differentiated adipocytes in a dose-dependent manner and downregulated PPARγ2. The gene-expression of adipogenic transcription factors C/ebpα, C/ebpβ, Klf5 and Srebp1c was decreased. This was accompanied by a reduction of adipogenic genes, including aP2, LPL, FATP1 and FAS, leptin and total PAI and an increase of adiponectin. Additionally, açai polyphenols protected cells against the production of ROS and decreased the expression of mRNA and protein levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines when 3T3-L1 cells were challenged with TNF-α. Thus, these results indicate that açai polyphenols may be useful in the prevention of adipogenesis, oxidative stress and inflammation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuterpe oleracea 3aadipocytes 3aadipogenesis 3aadiponectin 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3adose response 3agallic acid 3agene expression 3agenes 3ainflammation 3aleptin 3alipids 3amessenger RNA 3amice 3aoxidative stress 3apolyphenols 3atranscription factors 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 0aaP2 0aC/ebp 0aDCFH-DA 0aDMSO 0aFAS 0aFATP1 0aFBS 0aH2O2 0aIL-1β 0aIL-6 0aIL-8 0aINF-β 0aKlf5 0aLPL 0aLPS 0aMCP-1 0aNF-κB 0aPAI-1 0aPBS 0aPPAR γ 0aROS 0aSrebp1c 0aTNF-α 0aVCAM-1 0aAdipocyte differentiation 0aAdipogenesis 0aIntracellular lipids 0aInflammatory biomarkers 0aTranscription factors 0aOxidative stress1 aDias, Manoela Maciel dos Santos1 aNoratto, Giuliana1 aTalcott, Stephen1 aMertens-Talcott, Susanne U.0 tJournal of functional foods.g2016 May, v. 23 p.432-443dElsevier LtdwJournal:J000000142x1756-46467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jff.2016.02.0373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03249naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100001800181245008800199300001800287506007600305520187200381592002802253506003702281650001902318650002002337650001402357650001302371650001102384650001702395650001302412653002602425653001002451653001902461653001802480653002702498700001802525700002302543700001902566773013502585856007402720852000902794655001202803IND60624534720221207051140.0181204e20171101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062453472DNAL7 a10.1093/bib/bbw0802doi7 aPMC58622382pmcid7 a275859442pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDunn, William10aExploring and visualizing multidimensional data in translational research platforms  ap. 1044-1056.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe unprecedented advances in technology and scientific research over the past few years have provided the scientific community with new and more complex forms of data. Large data sets collected from single groups or cross-institution consortiums containing hundreds of omic and clinical variables corresponding to thousands of patients are becoming increasingly commonplace in the research setting. Before any core analyses are performed, visualization often plays a key role in the initial phases of research, especially for projects where no initial hypotheses are dominant. Proper visualization of data at a high level facilitates researcher’s abilities to find trends, identify outliers and perform quality checks. In addition, research has uncovered the important role of visualization in data analysis and its implied benefits facilitating our understanding of disease and ultimately improving patient care. In this work, we present a review of the current landscape of existing tools designed to facilitate the visualization of multidimensional data in translational research platforms. Specifically, we reviewed the biomedical literature for translational platforms allowing the visualization and exploration of clinical and omics data, and identified 11 platforms: cBioPortal, interactive genomics patient stratification explorer, Igloo-Plot, The Georgetown Database of Cancer Plus, tranSMART, an unnamed data-cube-based model supporting heterogeneous data, Papilio, Caleydo Domino, Qlucore Omics, Oracle Health Sciences Translational Research Center and OmicsOffice® powered by TIBCO Spotfire. In a health sector continuously witnessing an increase in data from multifarious sources, visualization tools used to better grasp these data will grow in their importance, and we believe our work will be useful in guiding investigators in similar situations.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abioinformatics 3adata collection 3adatabases 3agenomics 3amodels 3apatient care 3apatients 0ahigh-dimensional data 0aomics 0adata analytics 0avisualization 0atranslational research1 aBurgun, Anita1 aKrebs, Marie-Odile1 aRance, Bastien0 tBriefings in bioinformatics.g2017 Nov. 01, v. 18, no. 6 p.1044-1056dOxford University PresswJournal:J000001269x1477-40547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/bib/bbw0803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03079naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002400140245014000164300002000304520155800324592002801882650001701910650002201927650001901949650002101968650002101989650001502010650002402025650001402049650001502063650001602078650001302094650001302107650001902120650001802139650001302157650001902170650001502189650002902204650002302233650002102256650001002277650001502287700002102302700002402323773014302347856007402490852000902564655001202573IND60671077920221118191004.0191002e20150609xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067107792DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ta01087j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKwiatkowski, Maciej10aZnO nanorods covered with a TiO₂ layer: simple sol–gel preparation, and optical, photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical properties  ap. 12748-12760.  aIn this work, composite core–shell ZnO/TiO₂ materials were fabricated by deposition of TiO₂ layers via a sol–gel method onto ZnO nanorods hydrothermally grown on an ITO electrode. Two approaches to the sol–gel procedure resulted in strongly different morphologies and thicknesses of the deposited TiO₂ layer, as shown in electron microscopy studies. The decrease of the optical band gap energies of the ZnO/TiO₂ composites by about 0.2–0.3 eV with respect to the TiO₂ nanoparticles and ZnO nanorods was determined from UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra. The photocatalytic activities of the systems were determined by investigation of the decolorization of Methylene Blue (MB) in aqueous solution, irradiated with monochromatic light (LED, 400 nm). Depending on the TiO₂ layer morphology, and therefore the accessibility of the ZnO/TiO₂ heterojunction, the photocatalytic activities of the ZnO/TiO₂ composite systems showed 2-fold and 6-fold higher efficiency than that of the non-covered ZnO system. Addition of a small amount of methanol (3% v/v) to the MB test solution resulted in a significant drop in performance of all the ZnO/TiO₂ samples, suggesting that the photodegradation mechanism proceeds mostly via photogenerated holes and less likely via photoexcited electrons. Photoelectrochemical tests of ITO/ZnO/TiO₂ electrodes carried out in an acetonitrile solution containing ferrocene as a redox probe showed an increase in photocurrents in comparison to ITO/ZnO electrodes upon illumination with a xenon arc lamp.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetonitrile 3aaqueous solutions 3adecolorization 3aelectric current 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aelectron microscopy 3aelectrons 3aferrocenes 3airradiation 3alighting 3amethanol 3amethylene blue 3ananoparticles 3ananorods 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotolysis 3areflectance spectroscopy 3asol-gel processing 3atitanium dioxide 3axenon 3azinc oxide1 aBezverkhyy, Igor1 aSkompska, Magdalena0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2015 June 9, v. 3, no. 24 p.12748-12760dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ta01087j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02895naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001900155245015200174520157400326592002801900650002001928650001901948650000901967650001601976650001301992650001402005650000702019650001902026650001902045650003502064650002102099650001302120653001302133653001502146653001902161653001902180653000802199700001702207700001702224700001802241773009102259856009002350852000902440655001202449IND60756420220221120220330.0220124e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075642022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1328262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Hangjun10aNovel strategies for 2,8-dichlorodibenzo-p-dioxin degradation using ternary Au-modified iron doped TiO2 catalysts under UV–vis light illumination  aPolychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), characterized by their extreme toxicity, high persistency and bioaccumulation, regard as one of the most concerned environmental pollutants on the priority list. In this study, microwave-hydrothermal and photoreduction methods were adopted for fabrication of ternary Au@Fe/TiO₂ composites for removal of 2,8-dichlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (2,8-DCDD) under UV–Vis light irradiation. The acquired materials were characterized and analyzed by XRD, TEM, XPS, UV–Vis DRS, PL, etc. As a result, the 1%Au@1%Fe/TiO₂ exhibited much higher photocatalytic activity that 96.3% of 2,8-DCDD was removed within 160 min with respect to that of Fe/TiO₂ (3.0 times) and TiO₂ (5.5 times). It revealed the active substances might be produced, which were verified by ESR analysis. In a comparison, the 1%Au@1%Fe/TiO₂ also exhibited high activity in that 97.2% of 2,8-DCDD was removed within 240 min under an anoxic atmosphere. The 1%Au@1%Fe/TiO₂ systems were all pH-dependent that 2,8-DCDD could be fully degraded in neutral conditions. The results of repeatability on 1%Au@1%Fe/TiO₂ showed that the sample was high stability. Fe doping improved the charge separation of TiO₂ and Au modification improved the activity via SPR effect and Mott-Schottky barrier. The degradation mechanisms and pathways were proposed and discussed in detail. The current work develops a new approach on photocatalytic oxidation and reductive dechlorination of dioxins and may open a new opportunity to extend the application range of TiO₂ catalysts.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioaccumulation 3adechlorination 3airon 3airradiation 3alighting 3aoxidation 3apH 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotoreduction 3apolychlorinated dibenzodioxins 3atitanium dioxide 3atoxicity 0a2,8-DCDD 0aAu@Fe/TiO2 0aPhotocatalytic 0aDetoxification 0aROS1 aZhang, Yinan1 aZhong, Yuchi1 aDing, Jiafeng0 tChemosphere.g2022 Mar., v. 291 p.132826-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1328263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02838naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245009900154300001600253520130300269592002801572596009801600650002501698650001001723650001701733650001401750650001001764650001301774650001101787650000901798650001301807650005201820650001201872653002001884653001201904653001101916653001301927700001501940700001501955700001201970700001701982700001401999700001402013700001702027700001602044700001402060700001802074773013302092856007402225852000902299655001202308IND60624534820221119005037.0181204e20171101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062453482DNAL7 a10.1093/bib/bbw0812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXia, Siyu10aComprehensive characterization of tissue-specific circular RNAs in the human and mouse genomes  ap. 984-992.  aCircular RNA (circRNA) is a group of RNA family generated by RNA circularization, which was discovered ubiquitously across different species and tissues. However, there is no global view of tissue specificity for circRNAs to date. Here we performed the comprehensive analysis to characterize the features of human and mouse tissue-specific (TS) circRNAs. We identified in total 302 853 TS circRNAs in the human and mouse genome, and showed that the brain has the highest abundance of TS circRNAs. We further confirmed the existence of circRNAs by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). We also characterized the genomic location and conservation of these TS circRNAs and showed that the majority of TS circRNAs are generated from exonic regions. To further understand the potential functions of TS circRNAs, we identified microRNAs and RNA binding protein, which might bind to TS circRNAs. This process suggested their involvement in development and organ differentiation. Finally, we constructed an integrated database TSCD (Tissue-Specific CircRNA Database: http://gb.whu.edu.cn/TSCD) to deposit the features of TS circRNAs. This study is the first comprehensive view of TS circRNAs in human and mouse, which shed light on circRNA functions in organ development and disorders.  aPublisher supplied data  a81500140cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809 3aRNA-binding proteins 3abrain 3acircular RNA 3adatabases 3aexons 3agenomics 3ahumans 3amice 3amicroRNA 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3atissues 0atissue-specific 0acircRNA 0aRNAseq 0adatabase1 aFeng, Jing1 aLei, Lijun1 aHu, Jun1 aXia, Linjian1 aWang, Jun1 aXiang, Yu1 aLiu, Lingjun1 aZhong, Shan1 aHan, Leng1 aHe, Chunjiang0 tBriefings in bioinformatics.g2017 Nov. 01, v. 18, no. 6 p.984-992dOxford University PresswJournal:J000001269x1477-40547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/bib/bbw0813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02197naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001900154245013200173300001600305520120400321592002801525650002601553650001301579650001501592650001301607650001101620650002001631650002501651650001001676773010001686856008801786852000901874655001201883IND50067457520221117231047.0150206e200702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006745752DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1469-8137.2006.01927.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSobrado, M.

The study addressed the hypothesis that, at high salinity, water transport capacity may decrease in association with higher water use efficiency. • Plants were grown in media to which 0, 15 and 30 NaCl was added. Vessel density and diameter were determined in transverse sections of stem and midrib leaves in terminal shoots, and hydraulic parameters were measured. • In stems, the vessel density increased with salinity, while the anatomical diameter (dₐ) and hydraulic diameter (dₕ) declined; in leaves, these parameters remained unchanged with salinity. Huber value and hydraulic and specific conductivities decreased with salinity. Leaf blade resistance increased with salinity and represented the largest fraction of twig resistance. • Xylem anatomy and leaf tissue of L. racemosa appeared to be modulated by salinity, which led to a coordinated decline in hydraulic properties as salinity increased. Therefore, these structural changes would reflect functional water use characteristics of leaves under salinity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLaguncularia racemosa 3abranches 3aleaf blade 3asalinity 3ashoots 3asodium chloride 3awater use efficiency 3axylem0 tnew phytologist.g2007 Feb., v. 173, no. 3 p.584-591dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0028-646X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8137.2006.01927.x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02046naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245006300159520108400222592002801306650002501334650001801359650002301377650002301400650001801423650001301441650001201454650001101466650001101477700002901488773012001517856007401637852000901711655001201720IND60702888720221122225535.0200719e20191223xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070288872DNAL7 a10.3390/f110100292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGren, Ing-Marie10aMultifunctional Forestry and Interaction with Site Quality  aSeveral studies have shown the economic value of various ecosystem services provided by the forest. However, the economic value of how site-specific ecological conditions interact with other functions provided by the forest, such as timber value and carbon sequestration, has been less studied. As a result, this paper constructs a numerical discrete dynamic optimization model to estimate the economic value of site quality, taking into account its interaction with timber value and carbon sequestration, in Swedish forests. Analytical results show that the inclusion of the interaction of site quality with forest growth affects the optimal volume of harvest per year, compared to the case without consideration of site quality. The empirical results show that net present value, when considering timber values plus carbon sequestration and site quality interaction, is higher than the case where only timber and carbon sequestration were considered.

How sleep strategies of animals respond to alteration of macro-habitat has been largely unexplored. This study aimed to determine the effect of habitat type on the sleep ecology of the agamid lizard Monilesaurus rouxii. We carried out field work in the Western Ghats (India) biodiversity hotspot, in two differing habitat types—natural wet evergreen forests and human—modified Areca catechu plantations. We collected data on perches used by lizards for sleep, both in terms of their structural characteristics and their use (e.g. lizard head direction). To determine perch selection, we compared perch use with perch availability in both habitat types. Habitat type had limited influence on sleep perch selection of M. rouxii, with lizards selecting only unstable narrow-girthed plants, suggesting a highly conserved sleep strategy driven by predator avoidance. The majority of sleeping lizards displayed an ‘inward’ head direction, towards the potential path of a predator approaching from the ground. However, this strategy to select for narrow-girthed plants constrained lizards to use lower, unsafe sleep perches in plantations (driven by availability), which could have consequences for their survival. To our knowledge, our study is the first to examine in detail the effect of habitat alteration on sleep strategies in lizards. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Sleep strategies of animals in the wild could affect their chances of survival and their performance during active behaviours. ‘Where’ and ‘how’ animals sleep are important aspects of their sleep strategy. However, it is unexplored if these choices would change in response to human modification of the natural habitat. We compared sleep site selection in the semi-arboreal agamid lizard Monilesaurus rouxii in two different habitats (natural and human-modified). Lizards always chose narrow, unstable perch plants to sleep, as they allow for early detection of an approaching predator. In the human-modified habitat (Areca catechu plantations), opting for narrow unstable perches led to lizards using significantly lower perches, probably leaving them vulnerable to predators approaching from the ground. Our results show that exploring sleep strategies in the wild is necessary to properly assess the effects of habitat modification on species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAreca catechu 3aantipredatory behavior 3abiodiversity 3ahabitat destruction 3ahabitats 3ahead 3ahumans 3alizards 3aperch 3apredator avoidance 3aselection pressure 3asleep 3asociobiology 3aIndia1 aMohanty, Nitya Prakash1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7768-64831 aGowri Shankar, Pogiri0 tBehavioral ecology and sociobiology.g2020 Oct., v. 74, no. 10 p.121-121dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl6766x0340-54437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00265-020-02905-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle00833naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001700141245002400158300001400182520004400196592002800240650001300268650001900281650001900300650001700319773014600336856007600482852000900558655001200567IND60765352220221118234307.0220419e20120730xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076535222DNAL7 a10.17221/6118-cjgpb2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBobková, L.10aWinter wheat Mladka  ap. 88-89.  aThis article does not have an abstract.  aPublisher supplied data 3ajournals 3aplant breeding 3aplant genetics 3awinter wheat0 tCzech journal of genetics and plant breeding.g, v. 38, no. 2 p.88-89dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:12179x1212-19757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/6118-cjgpb3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04191naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245012500167300001200292500001900304520250800323592002802831596006502859596006102924650002502985650002303010650001903033650001403052650001603066650001003082650001003092650000903102650001103111650001403122650001203136650002403148650001803172650002003190650001703210650001803227650001203245650002103257650001703278650001103295650001003306700001803316700002503334700005903359773013903418856008303557852000903640655001203649IND60712273020221118060908.0201115e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071227302DNAL7 a10.1007/s00265-020-02915-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKopena, Renata10aSexually dichromatic coloration of female Iberian green lizards correlates with health state and reproductive investment  ap. 131.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aFemales often have chromatic patterns that differ from those of males. The evolution and function of female coloration is less known than those of males. Female ornaments can result from non-adaptive intersexual genetic correlation, but they may also signal female quality, health state, or potential fecundity. We examined whether the spectral characteristics of the sexually dichromatic coloration of female Iberian green lizards (Lacerta schreiberi) correlate with their condition, parasite load (ticks, hemoparasites and Borrelia infection) and the inflammatory response, and predict reproductive investment and offspring quality. Females with more intense UV-blue throat structural coloration and with more intense carotenoid-dependent yellow chests had less hemoparasites, and females with more saturated green dorsal coloration had lower tick loads. Also, females with greener backs seemed less prone to Borrelia burgdorferi s. l. infection. Surprisingly, in females not infected with Borrelia, there was a negative relationship between tick load and carotenoid content in the chest, which was not obvious in infected females. Characteristics of the females’ coloration may also predict several variables of reproductive investment, such as egg laying date, incubation time, hatchling number, hatching success, and body size and condition of their hatchlings. Because this is a polygynandric species and mating investment is costly for males, we suggest that males might use female coloration to select potential mates. However, we can expect that the physiological basis of coloration is similar in both sexes and, therefore, genetic correlation and sexual selection may act synergistically. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Despite widespread misconception that males are brightly colored and females are dull, females of some species also signal their quality with colorful ornaments. However, the function of female coloration is less often studied, although it may be important to fully understand sexual selection. Coloration of female Iberian green lizards is not so bright as that of males, but spectral characteristics of female colors can reflect body condition, parasite load, and immune response and, moreover, predict the number and quality of her future offspring. These correlations might help males to choose among female partners when selecting a good mate is a time and energy demanding task, increasing males’ fitness. This would support direct sexual selection of female ornaments.  aPublisher supplied data  aMICIIN CGL2011-24150/BOScministerio de ciencia e innovacion  aMINECO CGL2014-53523-Pcministerio de ciencia y economia 3aBorrelia burgdorferi 3aLacerta schreiberi 3abody condition 3abody size 3acarotenoids 3achest 3acolor 3aeggs 3aenergy 3afecundity 3afemales 3agenetic correlation 3ahemoparasites 3aimmune response 3ainflammation 3aparasite load 3aprogeny 3asexual selection 3asociobiology 3athroat 3aticks1 aLópez, Pilar1 aMajlathova, Viktoria1 aMartín, José,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6648-39980 tBehavioral ecology and sociobiology.g2020 Nov., v. 74, no. 11 p.131-131dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl6766x0340-54437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00265-020-02915-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02891naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245015100173300001400324500001900338520152800357592002801885650001901913650003001932650001101962650001301973650002301986650001402009650001502023650001902038650002202057650001102079653001702090653003102107700001902138700002202157700001802179700001902197700002602216700002102242773008802263856008502351852000902436655001202445IND60697712120221122224318.0200824e20201015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069771212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2020.05.1052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMortazavi, Bohayra10aNanoporous C3N4, C3N5 and C3N6 nanosheets; novel strong semiconductors with low thermal conductivities and appealing optical/electronic properties  ap. 40-50.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aCarbon nitride two-dimensional (2D) materials are among the most attractive class of nanomaterials, with wide range of application prospects. As a continuous progress, most recently, two novel carbon nitride 2D lattices of C₃N₅ and C₃N₄ have been successfully experimentally realized. Motivated by these latest accomplishments and also by taking into account the well-known C₃N₄ triazine-based graphitic carbon nitride structures, we predicted two novel C₃N₆ and C₃N₄ counterparts. We then conducted extensive density functional theory simulations to explore the thermal stability, mechanical, electronic and optical properties of these novel nanoporous carbon-nitride nanosheets. According to our results all studied nanosheets are found to exhibit desirable thermal stability and mechanical properties. Non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations on the basis of machine learning interatomic potentials predict ultralow thermal conductivities for these novel nanosheets. Electronic structure analyses confirm direct band gap semiconducting electronic character and optical calculations reveal the ability of these novel 2D systems to adsorb visible range of light. Extensive first-principles based results by this study provide a comprehensive vision on the stability, mechanical, electronic and optical responses of C₃N₄, C₃N₅ and C₃N₆ as novel 2D semiconductors and suggest them as promising candidates for the design of advanced nanoelectronics and energy storage/conversion systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon nitride 3adensity functional theory 3aenergy 3agraphene 3amolecular dynamics 3ananopores 3ananosheets 3asemiconductors 3athermal stability 3avision 0a2D materials 0aFirst-principles modelling1 aShojaei, Fazel1 aShahrokhi, Masoud1 aAzizi, Maryam1 aRabczuk, Timon1 aShapeev, Alexander V.1 aZhuang, Xiaoying0 tCarbon.g2020 Oct. 15, v. 167 p.40-50dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2020.05.1053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03104naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001500155245013200170300001600302520142900318592002801747650003401775650001501809650001501824650001801839650001901857650001301876650001601889650002301905650001801928650001501946650001701961650003501978650002102013650001102034650001502045650001502060650002402075650002502099650001502124653004402139653001902183653001002202653002502212653003302237700001702270700001302287700001802300700001302318700001802331773009102349856008902440852000902529655001202538IND60590716420221121043301.0180314e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059071642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2017.11.1702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLv, Longyi10aPredicting acute toxicity of traditional Chinese medicine wastewater using UV absorption and volatile fatty acids as surrogates  ap. 211-219.  aIn this study, the applicability of UV absorbance at 254 nm (UV254) and volatile fatty acids (VFAs) to serve as reliable surrogates to predict acute toxicity of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) wastewater was investigated. The medicine residues and VFAs were identified as main components of the TCM wastewater, and their individual and joint toxicity assays were operated with luminescent bacteria. The median effective concentration (EC50) values of medicine residues and VFAs were in the range of 26.46–165.55 mg/L and 11.45–20.58 g/L, respectively. The joint toxicity action modes of medicine residues, VFAs and medicine residues-VFAs were identified as additive, additive and synergistic respectively. UV254 and VFAs showed better correlations with acute toxicity according to the correlation analysis, compared with other conventional parameters. The regression model was a good fit for toxic unit (TU50) as a function of UV254 and VFAs according to the stepwise regression method (adjusted R² = 0.836). Validation of the model to the pilot-scale samples provided satisfactory prediction results in the influent and hydrolysis acidification effluent samples tests, but for EGSB effluent and final effluent samples, the model needed further optimization. Surrogates prediction using UV254 and VFAs provided a valuable and cost-saving tool for rapid or on-line monitoring of acute toxicity of TCM wastewater.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOriental traditional medicine 3aabsorbance 3aabsorption 3aacidification 3aacute toxicity 3abacteria 3acorrelation 3acost effectiveness 3adrug residues 3ahydrolysis 3aluminescence 3amedian effective concentration 3amodel validation 3amodels 3amonitoring 3aprediction 3aregression analysis 3avolatile fatty acids 3awastewater 0aTraditional Chinese medicine wastewater 0aAcute toxicity 0aUV254 0aVolatile fatty acids 0aMultiple regression analysis1 aLi, Weiguang1 aYu, Yang1 aMeng, Liqiang1 aQin, Wen1 aWu, Chuandong0 tChemosphere.g2018 Mar., v. 194 p.211-219dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2017.11.1703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02837naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001700144245009200161300001400253520148400267592002801751650002401779650001001803650001301813650001201826650002001838650001701858650001101875650001301886651001601899651001301915653003201928653002401960653003901984653002402023653001902047653004502066653002702111653003502138700001902173773011202192856007802304852000902382655001202391IND60485920820221119110411.0160218e20160106xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048592082DNAL7 a10.1515/jwld-2015-00242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTagar, Ahmed14aThe stability of soil aggregates in tilled fallow areas in Hyderabad district, Pakistan  ap. 51-60.  aArid areas are particularly susceptible to soil erosion due to long dry periods and sudden heavy downpours. This study investigates the aggregate size distribution and aggregate stability of twelve tilled fallow areas of Hyderabad district, Sindh, Pakistan. This study determined aggregate size distribution by dry sieving to evaluate the seedbed condition and aggregate stability using wet sieving to assess the susceptibility of tilled fallow areas to soil erosion. The aggregate size distribution of the soils of the selected areas was highly variable. Gulistan-e-Sarmast had the largest number of clods (51.0%) followed by Kohsar (49.0%), Latifabad # 10 (41.10%) and Daman-e-Kohsar (39.0%). Fazal Sun City, the left side of the Indus River, the Village Nooral Detha and the left side of the Abdullah Sports city had a greater number of large (>8.0 mm) and small aggregates (<0.5 mm). The optimum aggregate size distribution was found in the left side of the channel, which had the largest number of aggregates (50.50%) in the 0.5–8.0 mm sieve size range. Maximum aggregate stability (AS) was found in Gulistan-e-Sarmast (46%), Kohsar (42%) and Latifabad # 10 (34%), while all other soils had minimum aggregate stability (<14%). The minimum aggregate stabilities demonstrate that the tilled fallow areas of Hyderabad district are highly susceptible to erosion. Therefore, the present study suggests investigating potential ways to enhance the aggregate stabilities of soils.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaggregate stability 3aclods 3aseedbeds 3asieving 3asoil aggregates 3asoil erosion 3asports 3avillages 3aIndus River 3aPakistan 0aaggregate size distribution 0aaggregate stability 0aseedbed condition and soil erosion 0atilled fallow areas 0agrunty uprawne 0arozkład wielkości agregatów glebowych 0atrwałość agregatów 0awarunki wysiewu i erozja gleby1 aAdamowski, Jan0 tJournal of water and land development.g2016 Jan. 6, v. 27, no. 1 p.51-60dDe Gruyter Openx2083-45357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/jwld-2015-00243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03133naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002300155245008000178300001600258520160800274592002801882650002201910650002501932650002001957650002201977650000901999650001602008650002002024650001802044650001002062650001302072650001302085650001102098650002802109650001202137650001602149650001402165650002402179650001302203650001602216653003102232653001402263653002202277653001802299653002202317653001402339700002602353700002302379773009102402856008902493852000902582655001202591IND60590716520221121043237.0180314e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059071652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2017.11.1712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQuintaneiro, Carla10aEffects of the herbicides linuron and S-metolachlor on Perez's frog embryos  ap. 595-601.  aPresence of pesticides in the environment and their possible effects on aquatic organisms are of great concern worldwide. The extensive use of herbicides in agricultural areas are one of the factors contributing to the known decline of amphibian populations. Thus, as non-target species, amphibians can be exposed in early life stages to herbicides in aquatic systems. In this context, this study aims to evaluate effects of increasing concentrations of two maize herbicides, linuron and S-metolachlor on embryos of the Perez' frog (Pelophylax perezi) during 192 h. Apical endpoints were determined for each herbicide: mortality, hatching rate, malformations and length. Frog embryos presented a LC50 of 21 mg/l linuron and 37.5 mg/l S-metolachlor. Furthermore, sub-lethal concentrations of both herbicides affected normal embryonic development, delaying hatching, decreasing larvae length and causing several malformations. Length of larvae decreased with increasing concentrations of each herbicide, even at the lower concentrations tested. Malformations observed in larvae exposed to both herbicides were oedemas, spinal curvature and deformation, blistering and microphtalmia. Overall, these results highlight the need to assess adverse effects of xenobiotics to early life stages of amphibians regarding beside mortality the embryonic development, which could result in impairments at later stages. However, to unravel mechanisms involved in toxicity of these herbicides further studies regarding lower levels of biological organisation such as biochemical and genomic level should be performed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPelophylax perezi 3aabnormal development 3aadverse effects 3aagricultural land 3acorn 3adeformation 3aembryo (animal) 3aembryogenesis 3afrogs 3agenomics 3ahatching 3alarvae 3alethal concentration 50 3alinuron 3ametolachlor 3amortality 3anontarget organisms 3atoxicity 3axenobiotics 0aAlternative animal testing 0aAmphibian 0aEarly life stages 0aMalformations 0aPelophylax perezi 0aPesticide1 aSoares, Amadeu M.V.M.1 aMonteiro, Marta S.0 tChemosphere.g2018 Mar., v. 194 p.595-601dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2017.11.1713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02036naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100006300142245007500205520100800280592002801288596002101316650002401337650002501361650001401386650002401400650001801424650002401442651001401466700002201480700001901502773010301521856007701624852000901701655001201710IND60759175520221119044141.0211206e20211128xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075917552DNAL7 a10.1155/2021/38790992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEkawardhani, Savira1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8904-781110aAnthelmintic Potential of Medicinal Plants against Ancylostoma caninum  aAncylostoma caninum is one of the most important hookworms in dogs. A study revealed that the prevalence of ancylostomiasis in Indonesia is relatively high. However, cases of persistent ancylostomiasis in dogs were reported, indicating the possibility of anthelmintic resistance. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of the anthelmintic potential of plants preclinically against A. caninum based on related research articles. This review retrieved 14 articles from 2001 to 2021 investigating 19 different plants. Momordica charantia, Diospyros anisandra, and Citrus aurantiifolia hold a promising prospect as anthelmintic against A. caninum. This review found aspects of those medicinal plants that need to be investigated deeper to improve our understanding of the matter. In vitro results in this review have not yet been tested in in vivo trials, which are essential in determining the efficacy and safety of the use of these medicinal plants and also to justify its clinical application.  aPublisher supplied data  aRKDU 2021cUNPAD 3aAncylostoma caninum 3aCitrus aurantiifolia 3aDiospyros 3aMomordica charantia 3aanthelmintics 3aveterinary medicine 3aIndonesia1 aAnggoro, Utari T.1 aKrissanti, Ita0 tVeterinary medicine international.g2021 Nov. 28, v. 2021dHindawiwJournal:21537x2042-00487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2021/38790993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03126naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001600156245012800172300001600300520158400316592002801900650001801928650002301946650001301969650001801982650002202000650003602022650001902058650001102077650001602088650001302104650001802117650002502135650001402160650000702174650001702181650001402198650001702212653003302229653001802262653002202280653001102302653001902313700001602332700001502348700001402363700001602377700001402393773007802407856009002485852000902575655001202584IND60568005620221120190535.0170627e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056800562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2017.04.0432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Lanlan10aTumor associated macrophage-targeted microRNA delivery with dual-responsive polypeptide nanovectors for anti-cancer therapy  ap. 166-179.  aRepolarizing Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) to anti-tumor M1 macrophages with microRNA (miR) is a plausible approach for cancer treatment. However, how to achieve TAM-targeted miR delivery remains a challenge. The present study generated redox/pH dual-responsive hybrid polypeptide nanovectors, which consisted of self-crosslinked redox-responsive nanoparticles based on galactose-functionalized n-butylamine-poly(l-lysine)-b-poly(l-cysteine) polypeptides (GLC) coated with DCA-grafted sheddable PEG-PLL (sPEG) copolymers. The ex vivo study showed that sPEG shielded cationic GLC core at physiological pH but quickly shed off to re-expose GLC due to it charge reversible property. Encapsulation with sPEG/GLC nanovectors effectively facilitated macrophage-targeted miR delivery at the acidic condition but diminished miR uptake at neutral pH. Administration of miR155-loaded sPEG/GLC (sPEG/GLC/155) nanocomplexes increased miR155 expression in TAMs about 100–400 folds both in vitro and in vivo. sPEG/GLC/155 also effectively repolarized immunosuppressive TAMs to anti-tumor M1 macrophages through elevating M1 macrophage markers (IL-12, iNOS, MHC II) and suppressing M2 macrophage markers (Msr2 and Arg1) in TAMs. Moreover, the treatment of sPEG/GLC/155 significantly increased activated T lymphocytes and NK cells in tumors, which consequently led to robust tumor regression. Hence, TAM-targeted delivery of miR with redox/pH dual-responsive sPEG/GLC nanovectors could be a promising approach to re-polarize TAMs to M1 macrophages in situ and induce tumor regression.  aPublisher supplied data 3aT-lymphocytes 3acomposite polymers 3acysteine 3aencapsulation 3aimmunosuppression 3ainducible nitric oxide synthase 3ainterleukin-12 3alysine 3amacrophages 3amicroRNA 3ananoparticles 3anatural killer cells 3aneoplasms 3apH 3apolypeptides 3aremission 3atherapeutics 0aTumor-associated macrophages 0aNanoparticles 0aTargeted delivery 0amiR155 0aCancer therapy1 aYi, Huqiang1 aHe, Huamei1 aPan, Hong1 aCai, Lintao1 aMa, Yifan0 tBiomaterials.g2017 July, v. 134 p.166-179dElsevier Ltdx0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2017.04.0433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03629naa a2200709 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100002000156245015200176300001600328520149300344592002801837650001401865650001601879650001701895650002301912650001301935650002501948650001701973650002001990650002002010650001702030650001602047650001702063650001202080650000902092650002102101650001902122650001402141650001402155650002002169653001602189653002902205653003302234653002202267653002002289700002802309700002302337700002002360700002602380700002402406700001902430700002502449700002202474700002002496700002102516700001902537700002402556700001602580700003502596700002002631700002302651700001702674700002402691773009302715856009002808852000902898655001202907IND60603510520221117230434.0180716e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060351052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.05.0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHirt, Christian10aBioreactor-engineered cancer tissue-like structures mimic phenotypes, gene expression profiles and drug resistance patterns observed “in vivo”  ap. 138-146.  aAnticancer compound screening on 2D cell cultures poorly predicts “in vivo” performance, while conventional 3D culture systems are usually characterized by limited cell proliferation, failing to produce tissue-like-structures (TLS) suitable for drug testing. We addressed engineering of TLS by culturing cancer cells in porous scaffolds under perfusion flow. Colorectal cancer (CRC) HT-29 cells were cultured in 2D, on collagen sponges in static conditions or in perfused bioreactors, or injected subcutaneously in immunodeficient mice. Perfused 3D (p3D) cultures resulted in significantly higher (p < 0.0001) cell proliferation than static 3D (s3D) cultures and yielded more homogeneous TLS, with morphology and phenotypes similar to xenografts. Transcriptome analysis revealed a high correlation between xenografts and p3D cultures, particularly for gene clusters regulating apoptotic processes and response to hypoxia. Treatment with 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU), a frequently used but often clinically ineffective chemotherapy drug, induced apoptosis, down-regulation of anti-apoptotic genes (BCL-2, TRAF1, and c-FLIP) and decreased cell numbers in 2D, but only “nucleolar stress” in p3D and xenografts. Conversely, BCL-2 inhibitor ABT-199 induced cytotoxic effects in p3D but not in 2D cultures. Our findings advocate the importance of perfusion flow in 3D cultures of tumor cells to efficiently mimic functional features observed “in vivo” and to test anticancer compounds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3abioreactors 3acell culture 3acell proliferation 3acollagen 3acolorectal neoplasms 3acytotoxicity 3adrug evaluation 3adrug resistance 3adrug therapy 3aengineering 3afluorouracil 3ahypoxia 3amice 3amultigene family 3aneoplasm cells 3aphenotype 3ascreening 3atranscriptomics 0aBioreactors 0aTri-dimensional cultures 0aTumor tissue-like structures 0aColorectal cancer 0aDrug resistance1 aPapadimitropoulos, Adam1 aMuraro, Manuele G.1 aMele, Valentina1 aPanopoulos, Evangelos1 aCremonesi, Eleonora1 aIvanek, Robert1 aSchultz-Thater, Elke1 aDroeser, Raoul A.1 aMengus, Chantal1 aHeberer, Michael1 aOertli, Daniel1 aIezzi, Giandomenica1 aZajac, Paul1 aEppenberger-Castori, Serenella1 aTornillo, Luigi1 aTerracciano, Luigi1 aMartin, Ivan1 aSpagnoli, Giulio C.0 tBiomaterials.g2015 Sept., v. 62 p.138-146dElsevier LtdwJournal:11782x0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.05.0373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03028naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150100002300168245013400191300001400325520136100339592002801700650001701728650001301745650001101758650001201769650002701781650004401808650001301852650002501865650001201890650001501902650001101917650001601928650004401944650001701988650003702005650001202042650004702054650001502101650003002116650002502146650001602171650002602187700002802213700002902241700003202270773010202302856008502404852000902489655001202498IND4473120620221119150158.0141111e20120730xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447312062DNAL7 a224660062pmid7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2012.03.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhemkhao, Maneerat10aUASB performance and microbial adaptation during a transition from mesophilic to thermophilic treatment of palm oil mill effluent  ap. 74-82.  aThe treatment of palm oil mill effluent (POME) by an upflow anaerobic sludge bed (UASB) at organic loading rates (OLR) between 2.2 and 9.5 g COD l⁻¹ day⁻¹ was achieved by acclimatizing the mesophilic (37 °C) microbial seed to the thermophilic temperature (57 °C) by a series of stepwise temperature shifts. The UASB produced up to 13.2 l biogas d⁻¹ with methane content on an average of 76%. The COD removal efficiency ranged between 76 and 86%. Microbial diversity of granules from the UASB reactor was also investigated. The PCR-based DGGE analysis showed that the bacterial population profiles significantly changed with the temperature transition from mesophilic to thermophilic conditions. In addition, the results suggested that even though the thermophilic temperature of 57 °C was suitable for a number of hydrolytic, acidogenic and acetogenic bacteria, it may not be suitable for some Methanosaeta species acclimatized from 37 °C. Specifically, the bands associated with Methanosaeta thermophila PT and Methanosaeta harundinacea can be detected during the four consecutive operation phases of 37 °C, 42 °C, 47 °C and 52 °C, but their corresponding bands were found to fade out at 57 °C. The DGGE analysis predicted that the temperature transition can result in significant methanogenic biomass washout at 57 °C.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMethanosaeta 3abacteria 3abiogas 3abiomass 3achemical oxygen demand 3adenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis 3agranules 3aindustrial effluents 3amethane 3aprediction 3asludge 3atemperature 3aupflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor 2aAnaerobiosis 2aArchaeaxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aBiomass 2aMethanosarcinalesxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aPlant Oils 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aSewagexmicrobiology 2aTemperature 2aWaste Disposal, Fluid1 aNuntakumjorn, Boonyarit1 aTechkarnjanaruk, Somkiet1 aPhalakornkule, Chantaraporn0 tJournal of environmental management.g2012 July 30, v. 103 p.74-82dElsevier Ltdx0301-47977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2012.03.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03248naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100006300142245012600205520176800331592002802099596004902127650001302176650002602189650001902215650001602234650001102250650003002261650002802291650001302319650002002332650001102352650002102363650001602384650001802400650001302418650001702431650001902448650002402467650001302491651001302504700001802517700002202535700002002557773010302577856007702680852000902757655001202766IND60759175620221119043938.0211206e20211128xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075917562DNAL7 a10.1155/2021/54827252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWegi, Fekadu Gutema1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9800-785710aBrucellosis in Camels and Humans: Seroprevalence and Associated Risk Factors in Amibara District of Afar Region, Ethiopia  aBrucellosis is an important neglected zoonotic disease caused by infection with bacteria of the genus Brucella affecting different mammalian species including humans. A cross-sectional study was conducted to estimate the seroprevalence of brucellosis in camels and humans and its associated risk factors in Amibara District of Afar Region in Northeast Ethiopia, from October 2019 to May 2020. A total of 250 camel and 120 human sera were serially tested using the Rose Bengal plate test (RBPT) and complement fixation test (CFT). The overall seroprevalence of camel brucellosis in this study was 7.6% (95% CI: 4.9–11.56) by RBPT and 3.2% (95% CI: 1.63–6.2) by combined RBPT and CFT. In humans, twelve (10%) of the collected sera were positive by RBPT among which only four of them (3.33%) were positive by CFT. The risk factor analysis indicated that age, body condition, number of parity, and abortion history were significantly associated with Brucella seropositivity in camel (P ≤ 0.05). In humans, occupation and nonprotective handling of dystocia cases showed an apparent association with Brucella seropositivity. The results of this study indicated that brucellosis is a common health problem in camels and humans in Amibara District of Afar Region. The public health importance of this disease is associated with raw milk consumption and close contact with the animals having history of recent abortion. Therefore, controlling the risk factors, establishing Brucella diagnostic service in human clinics and hospitals, continuous social training with feedback assessments, and overall implementing of One Health approach framework to attain optimal health for people and domestic animals in area are recommended to safeguard the health of society.  aPublisher supplied data  cEthiopian Institute of Agricultural Research 3aBrucella 3aOne Health initiative 3abody condition 3abrucellosis 3acamels 3acomplement fixation tests 3across-sectional studies 3adystocia 3afactor analysis 3ahumans 3amilk consumption 3aoccupations 3apublic health 3araw milk 3arisk factors 3aseroprevalence 3aveterinary medicine 3azoonoses 3aEthiopia1 aAmenu, Kebede1 aChalchisa, Adugna1 aMamo, Gezahegne0 tVeterinary medicine international.g2021 Nov. 28, v. 2021dHindawiwJournal:21537x2042-00487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2021/54827253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03164naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001900156245012300175300001800298520146100316592002801777650002101805650002101826650001901847650001301866650001401879650002601893650002101919650001201940650002601952650001501978650001901993650001002012650001302022650001702035650001302052650001202065653001902077653001202096653001302108653001302121653002002134653001902154700002702173700002302200700001802223700002302241700002002264700002002284700002202304700002302326700002402349773010202373856009002475852000902565655001202574IND60599715520221119094126.0180702e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059971552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2014.04.1042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShrestha, Neha10aChitosan-modified porous silicon microparticles for enhanced permeability of insulin across intestinal cell monolayers  ap. 7172-7179.  aPorous silicon (PSi) based particulate systems are emerging as an important drug delivery system due to its advantageous properties such as biocompatibility, biodegradability and ability to tailor the particles' physicochemical properties. Here, annealed thermally hydrocarbonized PSi (AnnTHCPSi) and undecylenic acid modified AnnTHCPSi (AnnUnTHCPSi) microparticles were developed as a PSi-based platform for oral delivery of insulin. Chitosan (CS) was used to modify the AnnUnTHCPSi microparticles to enhance the intestinal permeation of insulin. Surface modification with CS led to significant increase in the interaction of PSi microparticles with Caco-2/HT-29 cell co-culture monolayers. Compared to pure insulin, the CS-conjugated microparticles significantly improved the permeation of insulin across the Caco-2/HT-29 cell monolayers, with ca. 20-fold increase in the amount of insulin permeated and ca. 7-fold increase in the apparent permeability (Papp) value. Moreover, among all the investigated particles, the CS-conjugated microparticles also showed the highest amount of insulin associated with the mucus layer and the intestinal Caco-2 cells and mucus secreting HT-29 cells. Our results demonstrate that CS-conjugated AnnUnTHCPSi microparticles can efficiently enhance the insulin absorption across intestinal cells, and thus, they are promising microsystems for the oral delivery of proteins and peptides across the intestinal cell membrane.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiocompatibility 3abiodegradability 3acell membranes 3achitosan 3acoculture 3adrug delivery systems 3ahuman cell lines 3ainsulin 3aintestinal absorption 3aintestines 3amicroparticles 3amucus 3apeptides 3apermeability 3aproteins 3asilicon 0aPorous silicon 0aInsulin 0aDiabetes 0aChitosan 0aCell monolayers 0aMicroparticles1 aShahbazi, Mohammad-Ali1 aAraújo, Francisca1 aZhang, Hongbo1 aMäkilä, Ermei M.1 aKauppila, Jussi1 aSarmento, Bruno1 aSalonen, Jarno J.1 aHirvonen, Jouni T.1 aSantos, Hélder A.,0 tBiomaterials.g2014 Aug., v. 35, no. 25 p.7172-7179dElsevier LtdwJournal:11782x0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2014.04.1043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04426naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100002500188245010600213300001200319506007600331520228800407592002802695596008002723506003702803650002102840650002502861650003102886650002602917650002502943650001202968650001602980650001302996650001703009650001703026650001703043650002603060650003803086650002103124650001503145650001703160650001703177650001803194650001803212650001803230650003703248650001103285650001003296650001403306650000903320650001303329650002203342650001703364650002403381650001403405650002003419650003203439700005903471773013103530856008203661852000903743655001203752IND60675880420221207101413.0201028e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067588042DNAL7 a317036732pmid7 aPMC68391662pmcid7 a10.1186/s12906-019-2730-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVeilleux, Marie-Pier10aDetermination of the effects of cinnamon bark fractions on Candida albicans and oral epithelial cells  ap. 303.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Candida albicans is an opportunistic pathogen that causes oral candidiasis and denture stomatitis. It has also been reported to infect oral mucositis lesions in patients who suffer from cancer affecting the head and neck and who receive chemotherapy and radiotherapy treatments. This study aimed to investigate the effects of two cinnamon bark fractions, i.e., an essential oil and an aqueous extract enriched in proanthocyanidins (Cinnulin PF®) on growth, biofilm formation, and adherence properties of C. albicans as well as on oral epithelial cells (barrier integrity, inflammatory response). METHODS: A microplate dilution assay was used to determine antifungal and anti-biofilm properties. A fluorescent assay was used to determine C. albicans adherence to oral epithelial cells. Cytotoxicity toward oral epithelial cells was assessed by determination of cell metabolic activity. Tight junction integrity of gingival keratinocytes was assessed by determination of transepithelial electrical resistance. IL-6 and IL-8 secretion by TNFα-stimulated oral epithelial cells was quantified by ELISA. RESULTS: While Cinnulin PF® did not reduce C. albicans growth, the cinnamon bark oil exhibited high antifungal activity with minimum inhibitory concentrations and minimum fungicidal concentrations in the range of 0.039 to 0.078%. The cinnamon oil was also active against a pre-formed C. albicans biofilm. Interestingly, Cinnulin PF® prevented biofilm formation by C. albicans and attenuated its adherence to oral epithelial cells. At their effective concentrations, the cinnamon oil and the Cinnulin PF® displayed no significant cytotoxicity against oral epithelial cells. In an in vitro model, both cinnamon fractions reinforced the integrity of the oral epithelial barrier. Lastly, Cinnulin PF® inhibited the secretion of interleukin-6 and interleukin-8 by oral epithelial cells stimulated with TNF-α. CONCLUSION: By their ability to attenuate growth, biofilm formation and adherence property of C. albicans, to reinforce the epithelial barrier function, and to exert anti-inflammatory properties the two cinnamon fractions (essential oil, Cinnulin PF®) investigated in the present study may be promising agents for treating oral infections involving C. albicans.  aPublisher supplied data  a2019-03-21cLaboratoire de Contrôle Microbiologique de l'Université Laval0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCandida albicans 3aalternative medicine 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3aantifungal properties 3abiochemical pathways 3abiofilm 3acandidiasis 3acinnamon 3acinnamon oil 3acytotoxicity 3adrug therapy 3aelectrical resistance 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aepithelial cells 3aepithelium 3afluorescence 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-6 3ainterleukin-8 3akeratinocytes 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3amodels 3amouth 3aneoplasms 3aoils 3apatients 3aproanthocyanidins 3aradiotherapy 3asecondary infection 3asecretion 3atight junctions 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha1 aGrenier, Daniel1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0878-46740 tBMC complementary and alternative medicine.g2019 Dec., v. 19, no. 1 p.303-303dBioMed CentralwJournal:21388x1472-68827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12906-019-2730-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02666naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245013500169300001600304520136300320592002801683650000901711650002201720650001101742650002901753650001301782650001601795650001901811653003601830653002901866653002101895653003201916653002701948700001701975700001801992700001302010700001402023700001602037773009702053856008502150852000902235655001202244IND60761194920221121143847.0220207e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076119492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2021.12.0932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeng, Jingping10aTheoretical and experimental study on the performance of a high-efficiency thermodynamic cycle for ocean thermal energy conversion  ap. 734-747.  aA new high-efficiency ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC) system using non-azeotropic mixed working fluids with two regenerative cycles is proposed. Based on the first law of thermodynamics, a numerical calculation model for the proposed cycle was established to study the effects of the mass fraction of mixed working fluids, turbine inlet pressure and seawater temperature on the performance of the cycle system. An experimental plant of the proposed OTEC system was established to study the effects of seawater temperature and turbine inlet pressure on the cycle thermal efficiency. The results show that the cycle thermal efficiency and net output power of the system both increase with a decrease in cold seawater temperature or an increase in warm seawater temperature. The system cycle thermal efficiency and net output power both initially increase and then decrease with an increase of the working fluid mass fraction. The system cycle thermal efficiency and net output power both initially increase and then decrease with an increase of the turbine inlet pressure under a certain working fluid mass fraction. The experimental results of cycle thermal efficiency with various performance parameters were basically consistent with the theoretical analysis results; however, the experimental values were lower than the theoretical analysis results.  aPublisher supplied data 3acold 3aenergy conversion 3amodels 3arenewable energy sources 3aseawater 3atemperature 3athermal energy 0aOcean thermal energy conversion 0aCycle thermal efficiency 0aNet output power 0aWorking fluid mass fraction 0aTurbine inlet pressure1 aGe, Yunzheng1 aChen, Fengyun1 aLiu, Lei1 aWu, Haoyu1 aLiu, Weimin0 tRenewable energy.g2022 Feb., v. 185 p.734-747dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2021.12.0933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02905naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003000148245011300178300001400291520131500305592002801620650001901648650001601667650002801683650001201711650002601723650001601749650002001765650001401785650002501799650002001824650003001844650001401874650001001888653003001898653002001928653002301948653002601971700002701997700002302024700003302047700002102080700002702101700002602128700002802154700002702182773008602209856008302295852000902378655001202387IND60564178420221120051837.0180830e20170205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056417842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gene.2016.11.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Melo, Anderson Sanches14aThe telomere attrition rate is not accelerated in women born small for gestational age: A birth cohort study  ap. 16-20.  aPhysiologically, a reduction in telomere length (LTL) occurs with aging, but epigenetic changes may accelerate telomere shortening and also facilitate the onset of oxidative/inflammatory stress and the development of clinical/metabolic comorbidities in life spam. Although individuals born small for gestational age (SGA) may be related to those epigenetic changes, the assessment of LTL in individuals born SGA has yielded conflicting results (only cross-sectional studies) and has not been carried out in longitudinal studies. We performed a birth cohort study to evaluate the rate of telomere erosion in women born SGA in comparison to women born appropriate for gestational age (AGA) assessed at two different time points during the third decade of life. In our research, born SGA or AGA showed no difference in LTL shortening during a period of five years in the third decade of life. Our finding may have implications for understanding the natural history of diseases in lifespan because the same women (under the influence of similar environmental factors) may be accessed in different phases of life. Thus, the analysis of the present cohort population at a more advanced age may reveal a dynamics of telomere shortening different from here and its possible relation with onset of age-related diseases.  aPublisher supplied data 3acohort studies 3acomorbidity 3across-sectional studies 3aelderly 3aenvironmental factors 3aepigenetics 3agestational age 3alongevity 3alongitudinal studies 3anatural history 3asmall for gestational age 3atelomeres 3awomen 0aSmall for gestational age 0aTelomere length 0aFoetal programming 0aEpigenetic alteration1 aReis, Rosana Maria dos1 aCalado, Rodrigo T.1 ade Carvalho Cavalli, Ricardo1 aBettiol, Heloisa1 aCardoso, Viviane Cunha1 aFerriani, Rui Alberto1 aBarbieri, Marco Antonio1 aVieira, Carolina Sales0 tGene.g2017 Feb. 05, v. 600 p.16-20dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6378x0378-11197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2016.11.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03984naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002400143245010000167300001600267520214700283592002802430650001302458650002102471650002302492650001202515650001202527650001202539650001202551650001202563650001502575650002202590650001702612650001202629650001502641650001702656650001402673650000902687650001402696650002302710650001402733650001502747650001502762650001402777650001302791650001102804650002002815650001202835650000902847650001302856651001202869653001402881653001902895653002202914653001602936653001402952653001102966700001802977700002402995700001803019700001703037700002103054773012503075856007703200852000903277655001203286IND60517311820221120081631.0160329e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051731182DNAL7 a10.4141/cjss-2014-0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPugliese, Stephanie10aWood ash as a forest soil amendment: The role of boiler and soil type on soil property response  ap. 621-634.  aPugliese, S., Jones, T., Preston, M. D., Hazlett, P., Tran, H. and Basiliko, N. 2014. Wood ash as a forest soil amendment: The role of boiler and soil type on soil property response. Can. J. Soil Sci. 94: 621–634. Wood ash is produced in large quantities in Canada as a by-product of the pulp and paper, sawmill, and bioenergy industries and it is anticipated that its disposal in landfills will not be a viable option. An alternative option may be to use it to amend forest soils. Wood ash is a complex mixture and its composition depends on several variables, including the combustion parameters of the boiler in which it is generated. We present an analysis of the amendment of two Canadian forest soils (a Brunisol from the Great Lakes–St. Lawrence and a Luvisol from the Carolinian forest regions of Ontario) with six different wood ashes collected from different biomass boilers through short-term controlled incubations. We show that following an 8-wk incubation period, amendment of the soils with wood ash led to small to moderate increases in soil pH, but had little effect on soil microbial activity and biomass. The concentration of important base cations such as calcium, magnesium and potassium as well as phosphorus generally increased in both soil types following amendment with different ash. This practice can return nutrients lost from forest ecosystems during harvesting; however, effects were found to be boiler-specific. Lastly, we show that four ash types led to small increases in cadmium in either soil; the concentration of all other measured heavy metals was not significantly increased following amendment, and in certain cases decreased, particularly with lead. The only potentially negative aspect encountered was elevated sodium, particularly with ash from one boiler, but unacceptable Na-absorptivity ratios were not exceeded. These results demonstrate that with proper characterization and selection of wood ash type and application rates, amendment of Canadian forest soils with wood ash may benefit forest ecosystems and is unlikely to disrupt the chemical and biological processes in soil environments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLuvisols 3aapplication rate 3abioenergy industry 3abiomass 3aboilers 3acadmium 3acalcium 3acations 3acombustion 3aforest ecosystems 3aforest soils 3aforests 3aharvesting 3aheavy metals 3alandfills 3alead 3amagnesium 3amicrobial activity 3anutrients 3apaper pulp 3aphosphorus 3apotassium 3asawmills 3asodium 3asoil amendments 3asoil pH 3awood 3awood ash 3aOntario 0aAmendment 0aneutralization 0amicrobial biomass 0arespiration 0anutrients 0aforest1 aJones, Trevor1 aPreston, Michael D.1 aHazlett, Paul1 aTran, Honghi1 aBasiliko, Nathan0 tCanadian journal of plant science.g2014 Nov., v. 94, no. 5 p.621-634dAgricultural Institute of Canadax1918-18337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4141/cjss-2014-0373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02423naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245008100168300001800249520142100267592002801688650001301716650001201729650001601741650001201757650001001769650002401779650002201803650001501825700001401840700001801854700001401872773009701886856008101983852000902064655001202073IND60086510320221120234533.0141101e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008651032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fct.2012.03.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aScognamiglio, J.10aFragrance material review on methyl 3-oxo-2-(pent-2-enyl)cyclopentaneacetate  ap.

Then, we demonstrated the negative correlation between miR-335 expression and the chemo-radiosensitivity of SCLC cells, including cell proliferation, cell clonality and cell apoptosis. In addition, miR-335 overexpression inhibited cell migration in vitro and tumor growth in vivo, whereas inhibition of miR-335 promoted cell migration and tumor growth. The underlying mechanism was further studied. Poly [ADP-ribose] polymerase 1 (PARP-1) was identified as a direct target gene of miR-335 in SCLC by bioinformatics analysis and validated via luciferase reporter assay. Overexpression of miR-335 decreased the expression of PARP-1 mRNA and protein, and NF-κB protein levels were correspondingly downregulated, thus regulating the chemo-radiosensitivity of SCLC. Taken together, these findings indicate that miR-335 may serve as a critical regulator of chemo-radiotherapy resistance in SCLC and a new potential therapeutic target.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3abioinformatics 3acell movement 3acell proliferation 3agene expression regulation 3agene overexpression 3aluciferase 3alung neoplasms 3amessenger RNA 3amultiple drug resistance 3aneoplasm cells 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 0aSCLC 0aPARP-1 0amiRNAs 0accRcc 0aNAD+ 0aqRT-PCR 0aGAPDH 0aDDP 0aVP-16 0aADM 0aCCK-8 0aIC50 0aSCLC 0aMulti-drug resistance 0aRadioresistance 0amiR-335 0aPARP-1 0aNF-κB1 aTong, Lihua1 aMeng, Hui1 aZhu, Weiliang1 aGuo, Linlang1 aWei, Ting1 aZhang, Jian0 tGene.g2017 Feb. 05, v. 600 p.9-15dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6378x0378-11197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2016.11.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01721naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002000152245007200172300001600244500001500260520025400275592002800529650002300557650002100580650001400601650002500615650001500640650001800655650001900673650001200692650002300704650001200727650002100739650002000760650001600780650001800796650001200814650001300826650002300839650001800862650001100880650002000891653001300911653001000924653001600934700001700950773010400967852000901071856008801080990002301168655001201191IND2060371720221116214608.0180905e199611  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206037172DNAL7 a10.1097/00017285-199611000-000072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcNUTT, KRISTEN10aSugar Replacers: A Growing Group of Sweeteners in the United States  ap. 255-261.  a2019-12-04  aConsumers are familiar with sugar-free intense sweeteners that provide only sweetness, without bulk or calories.

A lack of knowledge of the reliability of various computational solvation schemes for processes on metal surfaces is currently a limiting factor. Using a multilevel quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) description of the potential energy surface, we determined characteristic time and length scales for typical free-energy perturbation (FEP) calculations of bond cleavages in ethylene glycol, a sugar surrogate molecule, over Pt(111). Our approach is based on our explicit solvation model for metal surfaces and the repetition of FEP calculations to estimate confidence intervals. Results indicate that aqueous phase effects on the free energies of elementary processes can be determined with 95% confidence intervals from limited configuration space sampling and the fixed charge approximation used in the QM/MM-FEP methodology of smaller 0.1 eV. Next, we computed the initial O–H, C–H, and C–OH bond cleavages in ethylene glycol over Pt(111) in liquid water utilizing two different metal–water interaction potentials. Our calculations predict that aqueous phase effects are small (<0.1 eV) for the C–H bond cleavage and the activation barrier of the C–OH bond cleavage. In contrast, solvation effects are large (>0.35 eV) for the O–H bond cleavage and the reaction free energy of the C–OH bond scission. While the choice of a different Pt–water force field can lead to differences in predicted solvation effects of up to 0.2 eV, the differences are usually smaller (<0.1 eV), and the trends are always the same. In contrast, implicit solvation methods appear to currently not be able to reliably describe solvation effects originating from hydrogen bonding for metal surfaces even qualitatively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGibbs free energy 3abiomass 3acarbon-hydrogen bond activation 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acleavage (chemistry) 3aconfidence interval 3adehydrogenation 3aelectrochemistry 3aethylene glycol 3ahydrogen bonding 3aliquids 3amodels 3aplatinum 3apolyols 3apotential energy 3aprediction 3aquantum mechanics 3asolvation 3asugars1 aZare, Mehdi1 aFaheem, Muhammad1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8336-61761 aHeyden, Andreas1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4939-74890 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2019 July 12, v. 123, no. 31 p.19052-19065dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b049943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02704naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002700143245012500170300001400295520140900309592002801718650001501746650001001761650001001771650001101781650001201792650001501804650002001819650001301839650001201852650001201864650000901876651001001885653002501895653002301920653002401943653001801967653001301985653001201998700001802010700001602028700001802044773008602062856007702148852000902225655001202234IND60485921220221119110140.0160218e20160122xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048592122DNAL7 a10.1515/bot-2015-00722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLizée-Prynne, Dominic10aNo sex-related dispersal limitation in a dioecious, oceanic long-distance traveller: the bull kelp Durvillaea antarctica  ap. 39-50.  aDispersal of dioecious floating seaweeds could be limited due to biological constraints. This study examined for benthic and floating populations (stranded individuals) of the rafting kelp Durvillaea antarctica whether male and female individuals cohabit within one holdfast. As a previous study had indicated colour differences between sexes, we also examined whether these colour differences are consistent and possibly related to pigment and phlorotannin concentrations. Our large-scale survey of rafted holdfasts and a small-scale survey of benthic holdfasts at two sites found that reproductive males and females do travel together in coalesced holdfasts, although this proportion is relatively low (5–17%). There were no sex-specific differences in pigment and phlorotannin concentrations, but there were significant differences between the two benthic populations. There was no relationship between the colouration of thalli and the concentration of pigments but there was a slight colour difference between vegetative and reproductive sexual stages. Based on these results we conclude that biological conditions are not the cause for the lack of genetic connectivity between D. antarctica populations from central Chile. Instead, we suggest that ecological processes, such as density-blocking and physical factors (i.e. currents and winds), limit the potential for successful rafting dispersal.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDurvillaea 3abulls 3acolor 3adioecy 3afemales 3amacroalgae 3amating behavior 3apigments 3asurveys 3athallus 3awind 3aChile 0achemical composition 0adioecious seaweeds 0adispersal potential 0aphlorotannins 0apigments 0arafting1 aLopez, Boris,1 aTala, Fadia1 aThiel, Martin0 tBotanica marina.g2016 Jan. 22, v. 59, no. 1 p.39-50dDe Gruyterx1437-43237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/bot-2015-00723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02428naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006300150245009900213300001600312520131600328592002801644650002201672650000901694650002201703653003001725653002901755653003501784653001901819653001601838700005701854773009701911856008502008852000902093655001202102IND60761195120221120132018.0220207e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076119512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2021.12.0952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiocic, Johannes M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0612-695310aEstimation of shallow geothermal potential to meet building heating demand on a regional scale  ap. 629-640.  aExtracting shallow geothermal energy using borehole heat exchangers (BHEs) can help decarbonising the residential heating sector, particularly where no other low-carbon heating solutions are readily available. To assist urban planners and policy makers in developing carbon-neutral heating plans, the regional technical shallow geothermal potential must be known. Here, we calculate the technical geothermal potential of BHE fields on a regional scale while taking potential thermal interference between BHEs, geological conditions, as well as space available for BHE installation into account. The number of BHEs placed is maximized and heat extraction rate from each BHE is optimized taking regional regulations into account. When the methodology is applied to the German state of Baden-Württemberg on a building-block scale, results suggest an annual technical potential of 33.5 TWh. We then link this technical geothermal potential to heating demand scenarios on a building block scale and the results show that, depending on the renovation status of the buildings, between 44% and 93% of all building blocks can be heated using only BHEs. This allows for a rapid identification of building blocks for which BHEs are not able to meet the heating demand and where other means of heat supply will be needed.  aPublisher supplied data 3ageothermal energy 3aheat 3aissues and policy 0aShallow geothermal energy 0aBorehole heat exchangers 0aTechnical potential estimation 0aHeating demand 0aResidential1 aKrecher, Marc1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2320-40280 tRenewable energy.g2022 Feb., v. 185 p.629-640dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2021.12.0953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02557naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005900146245018700205300002000392520094100412592002801353650001601381650001501397650002801412650001401440650001301454650001101467650001901478650001701497650001501514650001301529650001301542650001501555700006001570700006001630700001801690700002501708700001801733700002101751700002101772700002001793700001801813700001701831773013801848856008001986852000902066655001202075IND60655993220221123032944.0190808e20190710xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065599322DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b050052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTan, Yuan Yuan,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5307-293810aPt–Co/C Cathode Catalyst Degradation in a Polymer Electrolyte Fuel Cell Investigated by an Infographic Approach Combining Three-Dimensional Spectroimaging and Unsupervised Learning  ap. 18844-18853.  aCatalyst degradation at the cathode of a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) remains a critical issue for practical polymer electrolyte fuel cell (PEFC) operation, but such wet systems impede detailed visualization of degradation events in the cell during its operation. In this work, for the first time, operando spectroimaging (X-ray absorption near-edge structure–computed tomography) was used to produce clear three-dimensional (3D) images of the morphology, Pt and Co distributions, Co/Pt atomic ratio, and Pt valence state of a Pt–Co/C cathode catalyst in a PEFC MEA before and after performing a PEFC-accelerated degradation test. The infographic approach combining the operando spectroimaging and unsupervised learning of the 3D images revealed a catalyst degradation mechanism with different degradation behaviors for Pt and Co in the bimetallic catalyst and negligible migration of the Pt catalyst in local parts of the MEA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aabsorption 3aartificial intelligence 3acatalysts 3acathodes 3acobalt 3adigital images 3aelectrolytes 3afuel cells 3aplatinum 3apolymers 3atomography1 aMatsui, Hirosuke1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5483-34871 aIshiguro, Nozomu1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3330-62361 aUruga, Tomoya1 aNguyen, Duong-Nguyen1 aSekizawa, Oki1 aSakata, Tomohiro1 aMaejima, Naoyuki1 aHigashi, Kotaro1 aDam, Hieu Chi1 aTada, Mizuki0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2019 July 10, v. 123, no. 31 p.18844-18853dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b050053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01430naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002000152245013600172300001400308520034700322592002800669650002400697650002200721650001200743650002400755650001300779650002200792650002300814650001500837650001700852773010200869852000900971856008900980990002301069655001201092IND2123742720221116214306.0180905e199703  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND212374272DNAL7 a10.1097/00017285-199703000-000022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTOBIN, BRIAN W.10aNutrition in the Basic Medical Sciences Curriculum: An Introduction to Generalist Physician Training through Problem-Based Learning  ap. 54-62.  aDuring the past 10 years, as few as 22%, of US medical schools offered nutrition as a stand-alone required course.

Most of the epiphytes associated with Gracilaria chilensis belong to the order Ceramiales. Under laboratory conditions we studied the infection process of Ceramium rubrum rhizoids on G. chilensis collected from a northern Chilean farm. The rhizoid penetration was intercellular. The host cell wall and cortical cells adjacent to the epiphyte appeared compressed and disorganized. The rhizoids presented an extensive dynamic complex endomembrane system, mainly represented by a plentiful endoplasmic reticulum (ER) network, dictyosomes, electron dense material surrounded by ER membranes, membrane bodies and vacuolar sacs with fibrillar material. Two types of cell wall deposition can be suggested: i) one characterized by the direct contact of ER vesicles with the plasmalemma and ii) another represented by the ER contributing material to the cell wall indirectly through vacuolar sacs. This study provides the basis for a better understanding of the infection process involved in the epiphyte-host interaction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCeramium 3aGolgi apparatus 3aGracilaria 3acell walls 3acommercial farms 3aendomembrane system 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3aepiphytes 3aindustry 3amariculture 3aplasma membrane 3avacuoles 0aCeramium rubrum 0aepiphytism 0aGracilaria chilensis 0aultrastructure1 aMiravalles, Alicia B.1 aHughes, Melanie H.1 aLeonardi, Patricia I.0 tBotanica marina.g2016 Jan. 28, v. 59, no. 1 p.51-61dDe Gruyterx1437-43237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/bot-2015-00913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02952naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245009700167300001600264520145000280592002801730650001101758650002501769650001701794650001201811650001201823650002101835650002501856650001701881650001101898650002101909650001301930650001901943650001201962650002201974650002301996650000902019650001002028653002402038653001702062653002102079653001902100653001902119653002302138700002702161700002802188773012502216856008402341852000902425655001202434IND60121956320221119045524.0150324e20150223xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012195632DNAL7 a10.1080/10408398.2011.6537342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBabbar, Neha10aTherapeutic and Nutraceutical Potential of Bioactive Compounds Extracted from Fruit Residues  ap. 319-337.  aThe growing interest in the substitution of synthetic food antioxidants by natural ones has fostered research in identifying new low-cost antioxidants having commercial potential. Fruits such as mango, banana, and those belonging to the citrus family leave behind a substantial amount of residues in the form of peels, pulp, seeds, and stones. Due to lack of infrastructure to handle a huge quantity of available biomass, lack of processing facilities, and high processing cost, these residues represent a major disposal problem, especially in developing countries. Because of the presence of phenolic compounds, which impart nutraceutical properties to fruit residues, such residues hold tremendous potential in food, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic industries. The biological properties such as anticarcinogenicity, antimutagenicity, antiallergenicity, and antiageing activity have been reported for both natural as well as synthetic antioxidants. Special attention is focused on extraction of bioactive compounds from inexpensive or residual sources. The purpose of this review is to characterize different phenolics present in the fruit residues, discuss the antioxidant potential of such residues and the assays used in determination of antioxidant properties, discuss various methods for efficient extraction of the bioactive compounds, and highlight the importance of fruit residues as potential nutraceutical resources and biopreservatives.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCitrus 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3abananas 3abiomass 3abiopreservatives 3adeveloping countries 3afood science 3afruits 3afunctional foods 3aindustry 3ainfrastructure 3amangoes 3anutrition science 3aphenolic compounds 3apulp 3aseeds 0aAnticarcinogenicity 0aantioxidants 0abiopreservatives 0afruit residues 0anutraceuticals 0aphenolic compounds1 aOberoi, Harinder Singh1 aSandhu, Simranjeet Kaur0 tCritical reviews in food science and nutrition.g2015 Feb. 23, v. 55, no. 3 p.319-337dTaylor & Francisx1549-78527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10408398.2011.6537343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02359naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005600142245007800198520118500276592002801461650002001489650002901509650001001538650001801548650001701566650001601583650001801599650002201617650001101639650001801650650001201668650001501680700005801695700002201753700001601775773009601791856007701887852000901964655001201973IND60759176120221119043558.0211206e20211123xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075917612DNAL7 a10.1155/2021/72231642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhan, Rijwan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3354-304714aThe Use of Different Image Recognition Techniques in Food Safety: A Study  aFood safety refers to preparing, transporting, and storing food to avoid foodborne sickness and harm. From farm to factory and factory to fork, food items may meet various health dangers. Therefore, food safety is crucial both monetarily and morally. The implications of failing to comply with food safety requirements are varied. The requirement for accurate, quick, and nonpartisan quality assessments of these features in food products continues to rise with increased demands for dietary materials and high-quality requirements. Computer vision provides an automatic, nondestructive, and economic approach to achieving these aims. A substantial research has demonstrated its effectiveness for fruit and vegetable assessment and classification. It stresses the critical components of image processing technology and a survey of the most current advances across the food sector. This article outlines the essential parts of a computer vision system. In order to avoid foodborne disease and ensure food security, fast and effective detection of pathogenic microorganisms is crucial for public safety biomonitoring. Over the years, microorganism detection techniques have evolved.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputer vision 3aenvironmental monitoring 3afarms 3afood industry 3afood quality 3afood safety 3afood security 3afoodborne illness 3afruits 3apublic safety 3asurveys 3avegetables1 aKumar, Santosh1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2121-64281 aDhingra, Niharika1 aBhati, Neha0 tJournal of food quality.g2021 Nov. 23, v. 2021dHindawiwJournal:jnl10994x1745-45577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2021/72231643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04771naa a2200745 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024001900116024003500135040001800170100006200188245012900250300001200379506007600391520204600467592002802513596027502541596023002816506003703046650001503083650002403098650001503122650001103137650001603148650001103164650002803175650002803203650002703231650002503258650001003283650001203293650001603305650002103321650002003342650002303362650001803385650002603403650001203429650001903441650001803460650001903478650001203497650001703509650001903526650001903545650001403564650001403578650002003592650001003612650001303622651001003635651001803645700002003663700002303683700001703706700002503723700002503748700003203773773011703805856008203922852000904004655001204013IND60675880920221207114526.0210403e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067588092DNAL7 aPMC68421842pmcid7 a317035882pmid7 a10.1186/s12917-019-2159-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNgugi, Jeremiah N.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8274-954910aSeroprevalence and associated risk factors of leptospirosis in slaughter pigs; a neglected public health risk, western Kenya  ap. 403.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Leptospirosis is a neglected zoonosis of public health importance transmitted through contact with contaminated soil, water or urine of infected animals. In pigs the disease is characterized by abortion, still births and weak piglets. A cross-sectional study was conducted in May to July 2018 to estimate the sero-prevalence of leptospirosis and factors associated with seropositivity in slaughter pigs. A questionnaire was used to collect information on animal demographics. Serum was tested for anti-leptospiral antibodies using microscopic agglutination test (MAT) with a panel of 8 serovars. Sera were considered positive for sero-reactivity at a MAT titre ≥1:40 against at least one serovar. Chi-square tests were used to measure the strength of association between the MAT test result and exploratory variables. RESULTS: A total of 252 pig serum samples from seven slaughterhouses were tested for Leptospira antibodies by MAT. Of the 252 pigs sampled, 88.8% (244/252) were indigenous breeds; 55.6% (140/252) were female and 88.7% (220/252) were reared in extensive production systems. Eighty-three (32.9%; 83/252) sera samples tested positive on MAT against at least one serovar. Of the 8 serovars, the highest prevalence was recorded for serovar Lora 21.4% followed by Kenya 5.2%, Sokoine 3.6% and Grippotyphosa at 3.2%. Risk factors for leptospirosis seropositivity in pigs were: originating from farms with other types of livestock (OR 2.3; 95% CI 1.0–4.5) and mature pigs (OR 1.9; 95% CI 1.1–3.3). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that there is a high prevalence of leptospirosis positive pigs at slaughter in a small-holder livestock keeping region of the Lake Victoria basin. The potential for cross species transmission of pathogenic serovars is highlighted as well as the potential for occupational exposure to slaughterhouse personnel. Improvements in husbandry practices (confinement and rodent control) and public health education among slaughterhouse workers and other high-risk groups is recommended.  aPublisher supplied data  aBB/L019019/1cBiotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council, the Department for International Development, the Economic & Social Research Council, the Medical Research Council, the Natural Environment Research Council and the Defence Science & Technology Labora  aBB/P027954/1cGlobal Challenges Research Fund (GCRF) One Health Regional Network for the Horn of Africa (HORN) Project, from UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) and Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aLeptospira 3aagglutination tests 3aantibodies 3abasins 3ablood serum 3abreeds 3achi-square distribution 3across-sectional studies 3ademographic statistics 3adisease transmission 3afarms 3afemales 3afetal death 3ahealth education 3ahuman resources 3aindigenous species 3aleptospirosis 3aoccupational exposure 3apiglets 3apolluted soils 3apublic health 3aquestionnaires 3arearing 3arisk factors 3arodent control 3aseroprevalence 3aserotypes 3aslaughter 3aslaughterhouses 3aurine 3azoonoses 3aKenya 3aLake Victoria1 aFèvre, Eric M.1 aMgode, Georgies F.1 aObonyo, Mark1 aMhamphi, Ginethon G.1 aOtieno, Christina A.1 aCook, Elizabeth Anne Jessie0 tBMC veterinary research.g2019 Dec., v. 15, no. 1 p.403-403dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4152735x1746-61487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12917-019-2159-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03820naa a2200745 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245014500170520183900315592002802154650002802182650002102210650002002231650000902251650001402260650001302274650001902287650001802306650003502324650001902359650001002378650002502388650002202413650001602435650001202451650001502463650001402478650002002492650001002512651001602522653001402538653001402552653001302566653002002579653001202599653000802611653000902619653001502628653001002643653001002653653000902663653000902672653000802681653000802689653000802697653000802705653000702713653000702720653001002727653000902737700001802746700002002764700001702784700001902801700002502820700001902845773010402864856008502968852000903053655001203062IND60684032920221120035718.0200405e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068403292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2019.1090202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Dong Wook,10aPrenatal exposure to di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate and decreased skeletal muscle mass in 6-year-old children: A prospective birth cohort study  aPhthalate is a well-known endocrine-disrupting chemical that has anti-androgenic effects. Although there are several studies on the relationship between body composition and phthalate, studies that investigated the effects of phthalate on skeletal muscle during childhood are lacking.We analyzed data from 481 mother-and-child pairs enrolled in the Environment and Development of Children cohort in South Korea. We examined the association between phthalate metabolites (mono [2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl] phthalate [MEHHP], mono [2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl] phthalate [MEOHP], molar sum of MEHHP and MEOHP [Σ DEHP], and mono-n-butyl phthalate [MnBP]) in prenatal maternal urine and children's urine at the age of 6, and body composition indices (body mass index [BMI] z-score, percentage of fat mass, fat mass index, percentage of skeletal muscle, and the skeletal muscle index [SMI]) measured when the child was 6 years using a bioelectrical impedance analyzer.A 2-fold increase in Σ DEHP and MnBP in the prenatal maternal urine was significantly associated with a −0.07 unit (95% CI: −0.11, −0.03) and −0.09 unit (95% CI: −0.14, −0.03) change in SMI, respectively, in 6-year old girls alone. BMI z-score was also negatively associated with a 2-fold increase in MEHHP and MnBP in prenatal maternal urine as −0.11 unit (95% CI: −0.22, −0.01) and −0.15 unit (95% CI: −0.28, −0.02) change, respectively, only among girls. Among boys, phthalate metabolites in the prenatal and children's urine were not significantly associated with any body composition indices.Our longitudinal study shows that high levels of prenatal exposure to phthalates are significantly associated with decreased SMI among girls. We can postulate that anti-androgenic effects of phthalates during pregnancy may affect girl offspring's muscle growth.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioelectrical impedance 3abody composition 3abody mass index 3aboys 3achildhood 3achildren 3acohort studies 3adata analysis 3aendocrine-disrupting chemicals 3afat mass index 3agirls 3alongitudinal studies 3amaternal exposure 3ametabolites 3amuscles 3aphthalates 3apregnancy 3askeletal muscle 3aurine 3aSouth Korea 0aPhthalate 0aPregnancy 0aChildren 0aSkeletal muscle 0aObesity 0aDBP 0aDEHP 0aEDC cohort 0aMEHHP 0aMEOHP 0aMnBP 0aMEHP 0aLOD 0aBIA 0aSMI 0aFMI 0aGM 0aSD 0aIGF-1 0aPPAR1 aLim, Youn-Hee1 aShin, Choong-Ho1 aYi, Yŏng-a,1 aKim, Bung-Nyun1 aKim, Johanna Inhyang1 aHong, Yun-Chul0 tEnvironmental research.g2020 Mar., v. 182 p.109020-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12442x0013-93517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2019.1090203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01855naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245006400174300001800238520097200256592002801228650001101256650001901267650002101286650001501307650002601322700002301348773009901371856008601470852000901556655001201565IND60577682820221117021806.0170810e20170718xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057768282DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.7b015422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnderson, Morgan
J.10aMicrofluidic Surface Titrations of Electroactive Thin Films  ap. 7053-7061.  aWe report the use of microfluidic surface titrations (MSTs) for studying electroactive self-assembled monolayers (eSAMs) and other thin films. The technique of MST utilizes a microfluidic generation-collection dual channel electrode (DCE) configuration to quantify the charge associated with electroactive thin films that might or might not be in direct contact with an electrode surface. This technique allows for quantitative measurement of surface coverages, Γ, as low as 30 pmol cm–² for electrodeposited Cu thin films. Additionally, we show that it is possible to quantify Γ for ferrocene (Fc)-terminated alkylthiols in mixed-monolayer eSAMs. Interestingly, MSTs sometimes reveal a two-fold higher eSAM concentration compared to direct electrochemical measurements. This finding suggests that in these instances not all the constituent Fc-moieties of the eSAM are in sufficiently close proximity to the surface to be addressable via direct electrochemistry.  aPublisher supplied data 3acopper 3adirect contact 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aquantitative analysis1 aCrooks, Richard M.0 tLangmuir.g2017 July 18, v. 33, no. 28 p.7053-7061dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.langmuir.7b015423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02742naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001700094024002100111024004400132040001800176100003200194245008500226300001600311506017300327520096500500650002501465650002501490650000901515650002101524650002001545650001701565650002101582650001701603650001101620650002201631650001601653650001501669650001701684650004401701650002601745650001601771700002101787700002301808773011401831856011201945856009002057956008302147961000902230852000902239655001202248IND60006251420221214225547.0160511e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6000625142DNAL7 a3200582aris7 a10113/625142hdl7 a10.1146/annurev-food-022814-0157212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJohanningsmeier, Suzanne D.10aMetabolomic Technologies for Improving the Quality of Food: Practice and Promise  ap. 413-438.  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aIt is now well documented that the diet has a significant impact on human health and well-being. However, the complete set of small molecule metabolites present in foods that make up the human diet and the role of food production systems in altering this food metabolome are still largely unknown. Metabolomic platforms that rely on nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and mass spectrometry (MS) analytical technologies are being employed to study the impact of agricultural practices, processing, and storage on the global chemical composition of food; to identify novel bioactive compounds; and for authentication and region-of-origin classifications. This review provides an overview of the current terminology, analytical methods, and compounds associated with metabolomic studies, and provides insight into the application of metabolomics to generate new knowledge that enables us to produce, preserve, and distribute high-quality foods for health promotion. 3abioactive properties 3achemical composition 3adiet 3afood composition 3afood production 3afood quality 3ahealth promotion 3ahuman health 3ahumans 3amass spectrometry 3ametabolites 3ametabolome 3ametabolomics 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aproduction technology 3aterminology1 aHarris, G.

Factors such as climate, CO2 levels and region are known to affect polyphenolic compounds in wine; therefore a pilot study was conducted to focus on the Australian climate which has shifted from El Niño to La Niña. This research paper presents the influence of climate conditions and growing regions on the in vitro and ex vivo antioxidant capacity of red and white wine and the profile and concentration of polyphenols in these wines from the 2008 and 2009 vintages. The ORAC and polyphenolic data show that warmer climate wines had lower in vitro antioxidant capacity values but retained good bioavailability based on data from the RBC ex vivo assay compared to cool climate wines. Based on this pilot study, further research is being conducted at the National Measurement Institute, Australia (NMIA) with the goal of determining more polyphenolic compounds which appear to be affected by climate conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEl Nino 3aLa Nina 3aantioxidant activity 3abioavailability 3aclimatic factors 3aerythrocytes 3aglobal warming 3ared wines 2aAntioxidantsxchemistry 2aBiomarkersxanalysis. 2aClimate Change 2aPilot Projects 2aPolyphenolsxanalysis 2aVitisxchemistryxgrowth & development. 2aWinexanalysis 0aAustralia 0aAntioxidants 0aWine 0aPolyphenolics 0aClimate change 0aWine quality 0aIn vitro and ex vivo antioxidant assays1 aSheard, Amanda1 aPaimin, Rohani1 aBuddhadasa, Saman1 aDuong, Samantha1 aOrbell, John D.1 aMurdoch, Travis0 tFood chemistry.g2013 Oct. 01, v. 140, no. 3 p.500-506dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2013.01.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02899naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002000143245010100163300001500264520153200279592002801811650002301839650001201862650002401874650001801898650002201916650001501938650002301953650001201976650001301988650001202001650001802013650001702031651001202048653001502060653002502075653002502100653001302125653001202138653002202150700002302172700002502195773012302220856007702343852000902420655001202429IND60517312620221121083304.0160329e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051731262DNAL7 a10.4141/cjss-2014-0352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaker, Scott R.10aPhosphorus forms and response to changes in pH in acid-sensitive soils on the Precambrian Shield  ap. 95-108.  aBaker, S.

Soil acidification may explain declines in total phosphorus (TP) levels that have been observed in surface waters in central Ontario, Canada, but much of the research on phosphorus (P) mobility in pH manipulated soils has been performed at high P concentrations (i.e., >500 µM). This study investigated P fractionation in acidic (pH≤4.6) soils in south-central Ontario and relationships between soil pH and P sorption at relatively low P concentrations to test whether long-term declines in soil pH could have increased soil P sorption. Soils from three forested catchments that vary naturally in soil pH and outlet stream [TP] (0.1–0.4 µM in 2008) had very similar soil P concentrations and distributions (Hedley fractionation). Only hydrochloric-acid extractable P (i.e., apatite) differed amongst catchments and was greatest at the catchment with the highest stream [TP]. The fraction of P present as labile/soluble P did not decline with pH as expected and experiments indicated that P sorption at P concentrations between 4.52 and 452.1 µM was insensitive to manipulated solution pH. Soils were, however, able to sorb >90% of P added in sorption experiments at [P]≤452.1 µM. These results suggest that acidification-induced P sorption in upland soils has not contributed to observed decreases in surface water TP concentrations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPrecambrian shield 3aapatite 3aforested watersheds 3afractionation 3ahydrochloric acid 3aphosphorus 3asoil acidification 3asoil pH 3asorption 3astreams 3asurface water 3aupland soils 3aOntario 0aPhosphorus 0aacidification (soil) 0aHedley fractionation 0asorption 0aPodzols 0aOntario (central)1 aWatmough, Shaun A.1 aEimers, M.

However, only a few data is available on their biological impact on human cells. We investigated the biological impact of different Au@Fe3O4 Janus particle formulations in vitro to analyse specific uptake modalities and their potential cytotoxic effects on human cells of the blood regarding intravenous injection. We demonstrate that Au@Fe3O4 Janus particles exhibit a similar or even better biocompatibility compared to the well-studied spherical iron oxide nanoparticles. The impact of Janus particles on cells depends mainly on three factors. (1) Surface functionalization: NH2-functionalization of the Au or iron oxide domain induces a pronounced reduction of cell viability in contrast to non-functionalized variants which is caused by the damage of intracellular membranes. (2) The nature of the metal oxide component, greatly affects cell viability, as shown by a comparison with Au@MnO Janus particles. (3) The overall surface charge and the size of nanoparticles have a higher impact on internalization and cellular metabolism than the Janus character per se. Interestingly, Janus particle associated DNA damage is independent of the effects on the cellular ATP level. However, not only the structure and functionalization of the Janus particle surface determines the particle's adhesion and intracellular fate, but also the constitution of the cell surface as shown by different modification experiments. The multifactorial in vitro approach presented in this study demonstrated the high capability of the Janus particles. Especially Au@Fe3O4 Janus particles bear great potential for applications in vivo.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA damage 3aUrsidae 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aantioxidant activity 3abiocompatibility 3ablood cells 3acell viability 3acytotoxicity 3ahumans 3aintravenous injection 3airon oxides 3ametabolism 3ananoparticles 0aJanus particle 0aBlood cells 0aAmino functionalization 0aCell metabolism 0aUptake 0aCell membrane1 aErnst, Peter1 aSchick, Isabel1 aKöhler, Oskar1 aOehring, Hartmut1 aTremel, Wolfgang1 aHilger, Ingrid0 tBiomaterials.g2014 Aug., v. 35, no. 25 p.6986-6997dElsevier LtdwJournal:11782x0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2014.04.1113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02322naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245011000162300001400272520092600286592002801212650002101240650003001261650002801291650003001319650001501349650002801364653000901392653000901401653000901410653000801419653000901427653001101436653000801447653000801455653001001463653000901473653003101482653003001513700001501543700001701558700002001575700001701595700001201612700001501624773008501639856008301724852000901807655001201816IND60564179020221122034355.0180830e20170505xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056417902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gene.2017.01.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJia, Zhao10aRAP1B, a DVL2 binding protein, activates Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma  ap. 15-20.  aRAP1B is a small GTPase, which regulates multiple cellular processes. Up-regulation of RAP1B has been observed in several cancer types. Although previous study has shown that miR-518 inhibited the proliferation and invasion of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) cells possibly by targeting RAP1B, the expression pattern and the functions of RAP1B in ESCC are not fully understood. Here, we have fund that the expression of RAP1B was up-regulated in ESCC clinical samples. Gain-of-function and loss-of-function assays demonstrated that RAP1B promoted the growth, migration and metastasis of the ESCC cells. Moreover, the mechanism study showed that RAP1B interacted with DVL2, an important upstream regulator for beta-catenin/TCF signaling, and activated beta-catenin/TCF signaling. Taken together, our study demonstrated the oncogenic roles of RAP1B in ESCC, and suggested that RAP1B might be a therapeutic target.  aPublisher supplied data 3abinding proteins 3again-of-function mutation 3aguanosinetriphosphatase 3aloss-of-function mutation 3ametastasis 3asquamous cell carcinoma 0aESCC 0aATCC 0aDMEM 0aFBS 0acDNA 0aRT-PCR 0aGFP 0aPBS 0aRAP1B 0aESCC 0aBeta-catenin/TCF signaling 0aCell growth and migration1 aYang, Yang1 aDengyan, Zhu1 aChunyang, Zhang1 aDonglei, Liu1 aKai, Wu1 aSong, Zhao0 tGene.g2017 May 05, v. 611 p.15-20dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6378x0378-11197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2017.01.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01968naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245006500169300001600234520072800250592002800978650001401006650001401020650002301034650001701057650001001074650001101084650002101095650002201116650001401138650002201152653002001174653001401194653000901208653001001217700002201227700002301249700002401272700002001296773012501316856008401441852000901525655001201534IND60121956720221119045618.0150324e20150223xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012195672DNAL7 a10.1080/10408398.2012.6567702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeluso, Ilaria10aFlavonoids and Immune Function in Human: A Systematic Review  ap. 383-395.  aFlavonoids, through a modulation of immune function, have been suggested to be involved in the role played by plant foods in disease prevention.

This review intends to summarize the possible scheme through coupling chemical conversion of crop straws to biochar and biological conversion of livestock waste to value-added products thus reaching key nutrient circulation. Chemical conversion of crop straws to biochar was reviewed through summarizing the preparation methods and functional modification of biochar. Then, high-solid two-phase anaerobic conversion of agriculture bio-waste to value-added products and improved performance of bio-conversion through byproduct gases reuse and biochar supplementation were reviewed. Finally, high quality compost production through amendment of biochar and residual digestate was proposed with analysis of reduced nitrogen emission and carbon balance. The biological mechanism of synergistic regulation of carbon and nitrogen loss during bio-conversion with biochar was also reviewed. This will provide a model for synergistic conversion of agricultural wastes to value added products pursuing key nutrient circulation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal wastes 3abiochar 3abyproducts 3acarbon 3acomposts 3amodels 3anitrogen 3atechnology 3avalue added 0aAgricultural waste 0aBiochar 0aAnaerobic digestion 0aCompost 0aCircular economy1 aKong, Xiaoliang1 aSu, Jian1 aZhao, Danyang1 aDong, Wenjian1 aLiu, Chunmiao1 aLiu, Chao1 aLuo, Lin1 aYan, Binghua0 tBioresource technology.g2022 Feb., v. 346 p.126578-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2021.1265783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03017naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002600092040001800118100002600136245009100162300001600253500001500269520151200284592002801796650001701824650002701841650001101868650001601879650001001895650002701905650002801932650002001960650001001980650002201990650001702012650001202029650001302041650002802054651001202082653002302094653001402117653001102131653001402142653001902156653002202175700001902197700001702216700002802233700002502261773011802286856007402404852000902478655001202487IND4423851320221121234601.0151126e200907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442385132DNAL7 a10.2111/08-222.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDitchkoff, Stephen S.10aNutritive Quality of Highbush Blackberry (Rubus argutus) Exposed to Tropospheric Ozone  ap. 364-370.  a2019-12-06  aNumerous studies have examined the impacts of ground level O₃ on plants that are important for human consumption, but native species that are important for wildlife have received less scrutiny. During May––August 2004 we examined the effects of O₃ on biomass production and nutritive quality of highbush blackberry (Rubus argutus Link), an important forage for white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus Zimmerman) and other herbivorous mammals. Plants were fumigated in open-top chambers with three levels of O₃ in a randomized-block experiment with three replicates of each treatment. Our three experimental treatments were carbon-filtered air, characteristic of clean air quality; nonfiltered air, representative of air quality in Auburn, AL; and air with double (2××) the ambient concentration of O₃. Although biomass production was not influenced by O₃ exposure, nutritive quality of plants was associated negatively with O₃ concentration. Specifically, neutral detergent fiber was greater and relative feed value was less in plants exposed to elevated levels of O₃. Similarly, in vitro dry matter digestibility tended to be less in plants exposed to elevated O₃. Nutritive quality of regrowth vegetation followed a similar pattern, where neutral detergent fiber was greater and relative feed value was less in plants exposed to elevated levels of O₃. These data suggest that elevated levels of ground level O₃ could have implications for diet selection of herbivorous mammals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aplant stress 3ain vitro digestibility 3ashrubs 3awild plants 3aRubus 3aOdocoileus virginianus 3adry matter accumulation 3anutritive value 3aozone 3awildlife habitats 3awild animals 3amammals 3aregrowth 3aneutral detergent fiber 3aAlabama 0aground-level ozone 0aherbivory 0aforage 0apollution 0aforage quality 0awhite-tailed deer1 aLewis, John S.1 aLin, John C.1 aMuntifering, Russell B.1 aChappelka, Arthur H.0 tRangeland ecology & management.g2009 July, v. 62, no. 4 p.364-370dSociety for Range Managementx1551-50287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2111%2F08-222.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03538naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094024002200138024001900160040001800179100001600197245013100213300001800344506007600362520176400438592002802202506003702230650001102267650001902278650001602297650001102313650002402324650001102348650001102359650001302370650002002383650001502403653003602418653004502454653000902499653001502508653002102523653002802544700001802572700001502590700001502605700001402620700002802634700002302662700001502685700002202700700001902722700001802741773010202759856009002861852000902951655001202960IND60599716420221207065348.0180702e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059971642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2014.04.1132doi7 aPMC41016942pmcid7 a248561052pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Xueqin12aA comparison of bone regeneration with human mesenchymal stem cells and muscle-derived stem cells and the critical role of BMP  ap. 6859-6870.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAdult multipotent stem cells have been isolated from a variety of human tissues including human skeletal muscle, which represent an easily accessible source of stem cells. It has been shown that human skeletal muscle-derived stem cells (hMDSCs) are muscle-derived mesenchymal stem cells capable of multipotent differentiation. Although hMDSCs can undergo osteogenic differentiation and form bone when genetically modified to express BMP2; it is still unclear whether hMDSCs are as efficient as human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hBMMSCs) for bone regeneration. The current study aimed to address this question by performing a parallel comparison between hMDSCs and hBMMSCs to evaluate their osteogenic and bone regeneration capacities. Our results demonstrated that hMDSCs and hBMMSCs had similar osteogenic-related gene expression profiles and had similar osteogenic differentiation capacities in vitro when transduced to express BMP2. Both the untransduced hMDSCs and hBMMSCs formed very negligible amounts of bone in the critical sized bone defect model when using a fibrin sealant scaffold; however, when genetically modified with lenti-BMP2, both populations successfully regenerated bone in the defect area. No significant differences were found in the newly formed bone volumes and bone defect coverage between the hMDSC and hBMMSC groups. Although both cell types formed mature bone tissue by 6 weeks post-implantation, the newly formed bone in the hMDSCs group underwent quicker remodelling than the hBMMSCs group. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that hMDSCs are as efficient as hBMMSCs in terms of their bone regeneration capacity; however, both cell types required genetic modification with BMP in order to regenerate bone in vivo.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadults 3abone formation 3abone marrow 3afibrin 3agenetic engineering 3ahumans 3amodels 3asealants 3askeletal muscle 3astem cells 0aHuman muscle-derived stem cells 0aHuman bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells 0aBMP2 0aLentivirus 0aCalvarial defect 0aBone tissue engineering1 aUsas, Arvydas1 aTang, Ying1 aLu, Aiping1 aTan, Jian1 aSchneppendahl, Johannes1 aKozemchak, Adam M.1 aWang, Bing1 aCummins, James H.1 aTuan, Rocky S.1 aHuard, Johnny0 tBiomaterials.g2014 Aug., v. 35, no. 25 p.6859-6870dElsevier LtdwJournal:11782x0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2014.04.1133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02173naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100002400149245012000173300001400293520118700307592002801494650001201522650001301534650002001547650000801567650001001575650001101585650001301596651001401609700003301623773009701656856008501753852000901838655001201847IND4459974520221118105846.0141110e20110721xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445997452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2011.05.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPasquini, Andrea I.10aSouthern Patagonia’s Perito Moreno Glacier, Lake Argentino, and Santa Cruz River hydrological system: An overview  ap. 48-56.  aAn overview of the hydrological data from Patagonia’s Perito Moreno Glacier–Lake Argentino- and Santa Cruz River system reinforces our previous assertion that the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Antarctic Oscillation (AAO) are teleconnected with the rupture sequence when the glacier’s snout harmonically dams (during certain interannual periods) the Rico branch of Lake Argentino. It is clear, however, that the incidence of interannual climatic anomalies is not uniform in time and appears embedded in decadal or quasi bidecadal periods of relative damming inactivity. The use of nonparametric tests shows that there are no significant positive trends in the river’s annual discharge with the only exception of the yearly snowmelt/ice melt periods (September–October), when riverine flow appears to increase with statistical significance. The question of the glacier’s stability looks like a complex multivariate process, although we do not rule out the occasional role of ENSO/AAO. A longer hydrological data series (i.e., 100years) would prove useful in casting some light on this intriguing process, surely accounting for the glacier’s response time.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEl Nino 3aglaciers 3ahydrologic data 3aice 3alakes 3arivers 3asnowmelt 3aArgentina1 aDepetris, P.

Herein, interfacial reactions of the model thiophene-based oligomer, α-sexithiophene (α-6T), in ultrathin (5 ML) films with vapor-deposited Ag, Al, Mg, and Ca are investigated using surface Raman spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy under ultrahigh vacuum conditions. Although typically considered an electron donor, results indicate that α-6T is reduced by Al and Ca. The reduction product with Al is the tetrahydrothiophene, whereas complete degradation of the thiophene cores occurs with Ca with the formation of calcium sulfide. In contrast, for the higher work function Ag, contact doping from α-6T to Ag nanoparticles is observed, inducing the formation of polaron states at the interface. Inter-ring torsion by the C–C bond rotation is also induced by electron sharing between α-6T and Ag. Mg, which is expected to undergo electron transfer in a manner similar to Ca based on the work function, instead diffuses through these 5 ML films and deposits on or alloys with the Ag substrate beneath; however, electron transfer from Mg to α-6T is observed in thicker α-6T films suggesting that nucleation into structures with electronic characteristics that resemble those of bulk Mg metal occurs. Overall, the evolution of α-6T interfaces with these low work function metals alters the interfacial energetics through the formation of “gap” states, which ultimately impact the device performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aalloys 3aaluminum 3acalcium 3achemical bonding 3aelectron transfer 3aelectronic equipment 3amagnesium 3amodels 3ananosilver 3apolymers 3asilver 3athiophene1 aPemberton, Jeanne E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1710-29220 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2019 July 16, v. 123, no. 31 p.18877-18888dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b064793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03286naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245013300173300001800306520184400324592002802168650001502196650001902211650001602230650000902246650001302255650001602268650001802284650001902302650001902321650003102340650001702371650003302388650001102421650001102432650001702443650001402460650001602474650001202490650001302502650002102515650001902536700002302555700002002578773009902598856008602697852000902783655001202792IND60577683220221117021640.0170810e20170718xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057768322DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.7b017672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJourshabani, Milad10aControllable Synthesis of Mesoporous Sulfur-Doped Carbon Nitride Materials for Enhanced Visible Light Photocatalytic Degradation  ap. 7062-7078.  aMesoporous sulfur-doped graphitic carbon nitride (MCNS) materials were successfully synthesized using thiourea as a low-cost precursor and SiO₂ gel solution as a template through a simple thermal condensation method. The effects of three synthesis key factors, namely, the reaction temperature, the reaction time, and the weight ratio of SiO₂/thiourea, and also their interactions on the removal rate of methyl orange (MO) were investigated using response surface methodology, and the samples were subjected to several characterization techniques. Results showed that the optimized physicochemical properties could be achieved for the MCNS samples by controlling the synthesis key factors, and it was found that the reaction temperature and the reaction time had significant influences on the MO photocatalytic removal. Among bulk graphitic carbon nitride (g-C₃N₄), CN (undoped g-C₃N₄), CNS (sulfur-doped g-C₃N₄ without template), and TiO₂ (Degussa P25) samples, the optimized MCNS-4 illustrated the highest photocatalytic activity toward the removal of MO under visible light irradiation. The enhanced performance originated from the synergistic effects of high surface area, mesoporous texture, sulfur doping, and high visible light absorption, which were helpful for the separation and transportation of the photogenerated electron–hole pairs. Furthermore, MCNS-4 revealed high reusability and stability without any significant decrease in its efficiency. Our findings not only confirm the importance of simultaneous sulfur doping and mesoporous structure to synthesize highly active photocatalysts but also might provide a new insight into textural engineering of carbon nitride materials only by the optimization of the synthesis key variables, considering their interactions without relying on extra metal oxides.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3acarbon nitride 3aengineering 3agels 3agraphene 3airradiation 3amethyl orange 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3aphysicochemical properties 3aporous media 3aresponse surface methodology 3asilica 3asulfur 3asurface area 3asynergism 3atemperature 3atexture 3athiourea 3atitanium dioxide 3atransportation1 aShariatinia, Zahra1 aBadiei, Alireza0 tLangmuir.g2017 July 18, v. 33, no. 28 p.7062-7078dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.langmuir.7b017673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04427naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100001600188245011000204300001200314506007600326520223700402592002802639596007902667596006402746596006902810506003702879650000802916650002202924650001502946650001902961650001602980650002402996650001303020650002303033650001003056650001903066650002203085650002103107650002103128650002103149650001303170650003703183650001003220650001803230650001203248650001203260650001703272700001703289700001903306700001703325700001303342700001503355700001803370700002203388700001603410700001903426700001303445700001803458700001803476700001903494773011303513856008203626852000903708655001203717IND60675881520221207114532.0211015e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067588152DNAL7 a317037212pmid7 aPMC68421342pmcid7 a10.1186/s13071-019-3764-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWei, Wenrui10aComparative analysis of host resistance to Sarcoptes scabiei var. cuniculi in two different rabbit breeds  ap. 530.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Scabies, caused by infestation of the mite Sarcoptes scabiei, is one of the most severe ectoparasitic diseases in rabbits. Scabies seriously affects the commercial rabbit breeding, causing severe economic losses. Host resistance to S. scabiei is an important factor in further development of the rabbit industry. In the present study, we compared the host resistance to S. scabiei var. cuniculi of a new breed of domestic rabbit propagated by the Sichuan Animal Sciences Academy (QiXing rabbit, QX) compared with that of a traditional rabbit breed in the domestic rabbit industry (IRA rabbit, IRA). METHODS: Both QX and IRA rabbits were experimentally infested with live S. scabiei var. cuniculi mites for 48 h. Then, during the course of four-week experimental infestation period, the body weight of rabbits was recorded every two weeks for calculating body-weight variations in comparison to the non-infested control rabbits. Skin lesions in the foot area were assessed on weekly basis and serum samples were tested weekly for the estimation of changes in the total antibody levels (IgG, IgE and IgM). Moreover, DNA extracted from the blood samples was amplified for analysis of the genetic diversity in the major histocompatibility complex, class II, DQ Alpha (MHC-DQA) gene. RESULTS: Compared to the IRA rabbits, the QX rabbits showed a significantly higher (P < 0.05) relative body weight gain compared to the non-infested control rabbits and significantly lower (P < 0.05) scores for foot skin lesions and higher levels of IgG, IgE and IgM at weeks 1 to 4, week 2 and week 1 post-infestation, respectively. Furthermore, a polymorphism site at position 103 bp of exon two of MHC-DQA gene and a different gene frequency were found between two rabbit breeds, suggesting the genetic basis for the differential host resistance to the S. scabiei var. cuniculi between two rabbit breeds. CONCLUSIONS: The QX rabbits showed higher host resistance to S. scabiei var. cuniculi compared to the IRA rabbits at the clinical, immunological and genetic levels. These results provide a reference for the breeding of rabbits with adequately improved and sustained host resistance to scabies in the domestic rabbit industry.  aPublisher supplied data  aCPF2014-17cResearch Fund for the Chengdu Research of Giant Panda Breeding  a2016NYZ0046cLivestock Breeding Project of Sichuan Province  aSASA2014CZYX005cSpecial Financial Operation of Sichuan Province0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aSarcoptes scabiei 3aantibodies 3ablood sampling 3ablood serum 3abody weight changes 3abreeding 3adisease resistance 3aexons 3agene frequency 3agenetic variation 3aimmunoglobulin E 3aimmunoglobulin G 3aimmunoglobulin M 3aindustry 3amajor histocompatibility complex 3amites 3arabbit breeds 3arabbits 3ascabies 3askin lesions1 aRen, Yongjun1 aShen, Nengxing1 aSong, Hongyu1 aXu, Jing1 aHua, Ruiqi1 aZhang, Haojie1 aAngel, Christiana1 aGu, Xiaobin1 aKuang, Liangde1 aXie, Yue1 aPeng, Xuerong1 aXie, Xiaohong1 aYang, Guangyou0 tParasites & vectors.g2019 Dec., v. 12, no. 1 p.530-530dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4347486x1756-33057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-019-3764-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02861naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002900150245011300179520144800292592002801740650001501768650001401783650002101797650001901818650001701837650001501854650001001869650002101879650003101900650003701931650002001968650001501988653001602003653002202019653003402041653001902075653002102094700002402115700002102139700002302160700002202183773010402205856008502309852000902394655001202403IND60684033520221120035638.0200419e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068403352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2020.1092192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAzari, Mansour Rezazadeh10aAdditive toxicity of Co-exposure to pristine multi-walled carbon nanotubes and benzo α pyrene in lung cells  aThe Mixture exposure to pristine multi-walled carbon nanotubes (P-MWCNTs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) such as benzo α pyrene (BaP) in the environment is inevitable. Assessment toxicity of P-MWCNTs and BaP individually may not provide sufficient toxicological information. The objective of this work is to investigate the combined toxicity of P-MWCNTs and BaP in human epithelial lung cells (A549). The physico-chemical properties of P-MWCNTs were determined suing analytical instruments. The toxicity of P-MWCNTs and BaP on A549 lung cells individually or combined were assessed. For toxicity assessment, cell viability, ROS generation, oxidative DNA damage, and apoptosis experiments were conducted. The results of this study demonstrated that P-MWCNTs and BaP individually reduced cell viability in A549 lung cells, and oxidative stress was as the possible mechanism of cytotoxicity. The co-exposure to P-MWCNTs and BaP enhanced the cytotoxicity compared to exposure to P-MWCNTs and BaP individually, but not statistically significant. The two-factorial analysis demonstrated an additive toxicity interaction for co-exposure to P-MWCNTs and BaP. The complicated toxicity interaction among BaP with fibers and metal impurities of P-MWCNTS could be probable reasons for additive toxicity interaction. Results of this study could be helpful as the basis for future studies and risk assessment of co-exposure to MWCNTs and PAHs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA damage 3aapoptosis 3acarbon nanotubes 3acell viability 3acytotoxicity 3aepithelium 3alungs 3aoxidative stress 3aphysicochemical properties 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3arisk assessment 3atoxicology 0aCo-exposure 0aAdditive toxicity 0aMulti walled-carbon nanotubes 0aBenzo a pyrene 0aMetal impurities1 aMohammadian, Yousef1 aPourahmad, Jalal1 aKhodagholi, Fariba1 aMehrabi, Yadollah0 tEnvironmental research.g2020 Apr., v. 183 p.109219-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12442x0013-93517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2020.1092193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02892naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245012800165300001800293520171700311592002802028650001502056650001602071650000902087650002402096650001902120650001102139650002302150650001102173700002002184700001802204700002202222700001802244700002502262700002502287773009902312856008602411852000902497655001202506IND60577683320221117021833.0170810e20170725xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057768332DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.7b005232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMin, Hwall10aModified Random Sequential Adsorption Model for Understanding Kinetics of Proteins Adsorption at a Liquid–Solid Interface  ap. 7215-7224.  aIn this Article, we experimentally measure the adsorption kinetics of human serum albumin (HSA) on a hydrophobic hexadecanethiolated gold surface. We use micromachined quartz crystal resonators with fundamental frequency of 83 MHz to accomplish these measurements in real time. In this work, we focus on two key results: (i) asymptotic behavior of the sensor responses upon HSA adsorption and (ii) the jamming limit of adsorbed layer formed by both single-injection and multi-injection experiments with the same value of final concentration. We develop a new interface-depletion modified random sequential adsorption (RSA) model to elucidate the adsorption kinetics and the transport properties of the protein molecules. Analysis of the experimentally measured data shows that the results can be explained on the basis of the exponentially depleting interfacial layer RSA model. To better understand the origin of the formation of the interfacial depletion region where the supply of protein molecules is dramatically reduced, we performed a series of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using the ReaxFF method. These simulations predict that the resulting adsorption of the protein molecules on the thiolated surface results in a specific orientation at the interface and the diffusion constant of the protein molecules in this layer is significantly reduced. This interplay between the surface adsorption rate and the reduced diffusion coefficient leads to the depletion of the protein molecules in the interfacial layer where the concentration of the protein molecules is much less than the bulk concentration and explains the observed slowdown of the HSA adsorption characteristics on a hydrophobic surface.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3adiffusivity 3agold 3ahuman serum albumin 3ahydrophobicity 3amodels 3amolecular dynamics 3aquartz1 aFreeman, Eugene1 aZhang, Weiwei1 aAshraf, Chowdhury1 aAllara, David1 avan Duin, Adri C.

The levels of N in the plant sap can vary as function of the N fertilization applied to enhance crop yield, while deficit of water takes place during drought periods. The performance of the striped mealybug on cotton plants subjected to N fertilization and water stress (=deficit of water) was evaluated. Potted cotton plants grown in a greenhouse were subjected to N fertilization and two irrigation regimes considering regular irrigation and water stress. Cotton plants were infested with 150 newly hatched nymphs. The survival was measured as the percentage of mealybugs alive 25 days after infestation. The biological traits of duration of development + the pre-reproductive period, and the number and sex ratio of the offspring were determined. The survival of nymphs was similar across all treatments and averaged 38 %. Likewise, the developmental times were similar across treatments averaging 47 days, with 84 % of female offspring. However, offspring production was nearly twofold higher for water-stressed plants with successive N fertilizations. Offspring production was increased by 37 % as a function of water stress, and by 18 % as a function of N fertilization. Therefore, we conclude that the striped mealybug performance is enhanced on cotton plants under N fertilization and water stress. Based on the results, proper fertilization and irrigation management relieving plant from stress can be helpful in avoiding generalized infestations of striped mealybug on cotton.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFerrisia virgata 3adrought 3acrop yield 3asap 3ainsects 3agreenhouses 3asex ratio 3awater stress 3anymphs 3aplant development 3areproductive performance 3ahost plants 3awater content 3aprogeny 3anitrogen fertilizers 3acotton 3airrigation water 3anitrogen 3anutritive value 3airrigation management 0aHemiptera1 aBarbosa, Paulo R.

Previously established common garden experiments indicated that the morphological differentiation is most likely genetically determined. The genetic structure of Norway spruce morphological variants might be an indicator (marker) of specific sustainability in forest ecosystems. In this study, we investigated 436 individuals from autochthonous populations belonging to three different ecotypes. The main aim was to evaluate a level of genetic intra and interpopulation diversity among the low, medium and high-elevation ecotypes using both expressed sequence tag simple sequence repeats (EST – SSR) and genomic SSR markers. Sixteen highly polymorphic microsatellite loci folded in two newly designed multiplexes were used to depicture the genetic structure of targeted trees. Important allele frequency parameters, such as the mean expected (0.722, SE = 0.061) and observed (0.585, SE = 0.062) heterozygosity and mean effective number of alleles (Nₑ = 5.943, SE = 1.279), were estimated. The low genetic differentiation detected among different ecotypes (Fₛₜ = 0.008) was further discussed and clarified.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPicea abies 3aalleles 3aaltitude 3aecotypes 3aexpressed sequence tags 3aforest ecosystems 3agene frequency 3agenetic structure 3agenetic variation 3agenomics 3aheterozygosity 3amicrosatellite repeats 3atrees 3aCentral European region1 aKorecký, Jiří 1 aDvořák, Jakub 1 aBílý, Jan 1 aZádrapová, Dagmar 1 aJansa, Václav 1 aLstibůrek, Milan 0 tForests.g2020 Jan. 16, v. 11, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f110101103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03178naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245012700164300001600291520100100307592002801308650001801336650001201354650002101366650001801387650002401405650001601429650001301445650002401458650000901482650000901491650002201500650000901522650001201531650001101543650002401554650002001578650003201598650001401630650001501644653003101659653002001690653001601710653001901726653003601745653003101781653004101812653003601853653004801889653003701937653004001974653003802014653003402052653004102086700001802127700001602145700001602161700001602177700001602193700001902209700001902228700001802247773011202265856008202377852000902459655001202468IND60527300220221116234923.0190415e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052730022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jff.2016.02.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMattioli, S.10aAlfalfa and flax sprouts supplementation enriches the content of bioactive compounds and lowers the cholesterol in hen egg  ap. 454-462.  aThe effect of dietary supplementation with flax and alfalfa sprouts (40 g/d) on bioactive compounds and cholesterol contents of hen's egg was examined. Thirty White Leghorn hens, 26 weeks of age, were fed, for 66 days, three diets that included control (standard diet – C), standard diet + alfalfa sprouts (A), and standard diet + flax sprouts (F). Productive performance of hens was recorded daily. The cholesterol content of plasma and yolk, and the presence of bioactive compounds in the egg, were also analysed. Supplementation of flax and alfalfa sprouts reduced plasma and egg cholesterol probably due to the synergy between different compounds of the sprouts (polyunsaturated fatty acids - PUFAs, lignans, isoflavones and sterols). Eggs from A and F groups also had higher contents of n-3 PUFA, vitamins (α-tocopherol, α-, γ-tocotrienol, retinol), carotenes (β-carotene, lutein, zeaxanthin) and phytoestrogens (daidzein, equol, isolariciresinol) than eggs from the C group.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWhite Leghorn 3aalfalfa 3aalpha-tocopherol 3abeta-carotene 3abioactive compounds 3acholesterol 3adaidzein 3adietary supplements 3aeggs 3aflax 3agamma-tocotrienol 3ahens 3alignans 3alutein 3aomega-3 fatty acids 3aplant estrogens 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 3avitamin A 3azeaxanthin 0aLaying hens, eggs, sprouts 0aω-3 fatty acid 0aTocopherols 0aPhytochemicals 0aDaidzein (PubChem CID: 5281708) 0aEquol (PubChem CID: 91469) 0aPhytosterols (PubChem CID: 12303662) 0aCholesterol (PubChem CID: 5997) 0aAlpha-linolenic acid (PubChem CID: 5280934) 0aTocopherols (PubChem CID: 14986) 0aTocotrienols (PubChem CID: 9929901) 0aZeaxanthin (PubChem CID: 5280899) 0aLutein (PubChem CID: 5281243) 0aBeta-carotene (PubChem CID: 5280489)1 aDal Bosco, A.1 aMartino, M.1 aRuggeri, S.1 aMarconi, O.1 aSileoni, V.1 aFalcinelli, B.1 aCastellini, C.1 aBenincasa, P.0 tJournal of functional foods.g2016 Apr., v. 22 p.454-462dElsevier LtdwJournal:J000000142x1756-46467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jff.2016.02.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04304naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245014300169300001600312520231100328592002802639650001702667650003102684650002902715650001002744650002302754650003602777650002402813650001302837650001402850650001602864650001502880650001302895650001702908650001402925650002102939650003602960650003402996650001803030650001303048650001703061650001303078650002503091651001703116653000903133653000803142653000803150653000703158653000903165653000903174653000803183653000703191653001703198653001603215653001803231653001703249653002303266653002103289700001503310700002103325700002503346773014503371856008103516852000903597655001203606IND60604630720221120074953.0180717e20151104xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060463072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jep.2015.08.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAremu, Adeyemi O.10aEthnobotany, therapeutic value, phytochemistry and conservation status of Bowiea volubilis: A widely used bulbous plant in southern Africa  ap. 308-316.  aBowiea volubilis Harv. ex Hook.f. (Family: Asparagaceae) is a bulbous medicinal plant widely used against numerous ailments including headache, muscular pains, infertility, cystitis and venereal diseases in southern Africa.To provide a critical and updated review of Bowiea volubilis with regards to its abundance, medicinal importance, conservation status and potential means to sustain its availability for future generations.A comprehensive literature search using online databases such as Web of Science, Google Scholar, Scopus and Springerlink as well as ethnobotanical literature was done in order to obtain, collate, synthesize and critically analyze available information on Bowiea volubilis.On the basis of its wide distribution in many Provinces in South Africa, Bowiea volubilis has a long history of applications among the different ethnic groups. These applications include its uses as purgatives and for the treatment or relief of microbial infections, skin disorders, pains and inflammation. Scientific validation of its diverse uses in traditional medicine has been demonstrated via antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory and toxicity assays. Available results indicate a general poor antimicrobial activity especially with the bulb extracts while the anti-inflammatory activity appears promising. Phytochemical screenings revealed that Bowiea volubilis contains cardiac glycosides and related compounds while reports of other classes of compounds are unavailable. In line with its usage in traditional medicine, the majority of available studies on the species have focused on the use of different solvent extracts from the bulbs. The destructive harvesting of bulbs has led to a continuous decimation of wild populations. Consequently, there are increasing conservational concerns on the sustainability of this species for continuous supply to meet escalating demands.Bowiea volubilis remains a widely used medicinal plant and available but limited scientific evidence indicates its anti-inflammatory potential. The abundance of cardiac glycosides in its phytochemical composition provides an indication on the therapeutic potential. More research efforts including the application of different biotechnological techniques are still required in order to guarantee its sustainable use over time.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAsparagaceae 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3aantimicrobial properties 3abulbs 3acardiac glycosides 3achemical constituents of plants 3aconservation status 3acystitis 3adatabases 3aethnobotany 3aharvesting 3aheadache 3ainflammation 3alaxatives 3amedicinal plants 3anationalities and ethnic groups 3asexually transmitted diseases 3askin diseases 3asolvents 3atherapeutics 3atoxicity 3atraditional medicine 3aSouth Africa 0aATCC 0aCOX 0aDCM 0aEA 0aEtOH 0aMeOH 0aMIC 0aPE 0aAsparagaceae 0aBioactivity 0aBiotechnology 0aConservation 0aCardiac glycosides 0aMicropropagation1 aMoyo, Mack1 aAmoo, Stephen O.1 aVan Staden, Johannes0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2015 Nov. 04, v. 174 p.308-316dElsevier Ireland LtdaElsevier Ireland LtdwJournal:jnl30651x0378-87417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2015.08.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02584naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245015800165300001600323520126100339592002801600650002701628650002601655650002801681650001401709650001201723650001501735650001501750650001601765650002101781650001101802650001001813650001901823650001001842650002301852700001901875700001801894700002001912700002601932773010201958856008102060852000902141655001202150IND60082053220221118160507.0141016e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008205322DNAL7 a10.1007/s11829-014-9322-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOster, Marina10aOrientation behavior of predaceous ground beetle species in response to volatile emissions identified from yellow starthistle damaged by an invasive slug  ap. 429-437.  aWe investigated indirect defense in the yellow starthistle (Centaurea solstitialis)–grey garden slug (Deroceras reticulatum)–ground beetle (Pterostichus melanarius and Scaphinotus interruptus) system. In this host plant/herbivore/predator system, the ground beetles are the primary predator of D. reticulatum, the dominant herbivore of the highly invasive weed, C. solstitialis. The aim of our study was to examine the behavioral responses of two species of ground beetle to olfactory stimuli emitted from yellow starthistle damaged by D. reticulatum. The beetle P. melanarius showed a significant preference for the odor of damaged yellow starthistle relative to the odor of intact plants, while S. interruptus did not. Volatiles from D. reticulatum-damaged yellow starthistle were collected and identified as trans-β-farnesene, germacrene D, bicyclogermacrene, and 1,5,9-trimethyl-1,5,9-cyclododecatriene. No quantitative relationship was observed between beetle plant choice or decision time and the level of herbivory. Similarly, there was no relationship between volatile compound relative abundance and level of herbivory, suggesting that our range of leaf damage produces either undetectable semiochemicals or no variation in volatile emission.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCentaurea solstitialis 3aDeroceras reticulatum 3aPterostichus melanarius 3aemissions 3agardens 3agermacrene 3aherbivores 3ahost plants 3ainvasive species 3aleaves 3aodors 3asemiochemicals 3aslugs 3avolatile compounds1 aSmith, Lincoln1 aBeck, John J.1 aHoward, Abigail1 aField, Christopher B.0 tArthropod-plant interactions.g2014 Oct., v. 8, no. 5 p.429-437dSpringer-Verlagx1872-88557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11829-014-9322-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02478naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002700148245008800175300001800263500001900281520123700300592002801537650001201565650002501577650001801602650000901620650001401629650001701643650001401660650001901674650001901693650000701712650002501719650002801744650001801772700002101790700001801811773014801829856008201977852000902059655001202068IND60712267720221118060851.0201009e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071226772DNAL7 a10.1007/s00216-020-02891-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaierhofer, Maximilian10aOptical ammonia sensors based on fluorescent aza-BODIPY dyes— a flexible toolbox  ap. 7559-7567.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aWe present three types of optical ammonia sensors suitable for environmental, bioprocess, and reaction monitoring. A respective fluorescent BF₂-chelated tetraarylazadipyrromethene dye (aza-BODIPYs) is physically entrapped in a polyurethane hydrogel (HydroMed D4) forming an emulsion system with vinyl-terminated polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). The analyte-sensitive layer is covered by a hydrophobic membrane which excludes hydrophilic substances. Three different protection layers are tested, whereby the Teflon and the hydrophobic PES layers outperform a PDMS/TiO₂ layer. Response times within their dynamic range of 15 s can be achieved, whereas the PDMS/TiO₂-covered sensor requires at least 390 s. The three sensors entail the following concentration areas: first sensor 3 μg L⁻¹–3 mg L⁻¹ (LOD 0.23 μg L⁻¹), second sensor 0.1–30 mg L⁻¹ (LOD 28 μg L⁻¹), and third sensor 3 mg L⁻¹–1 g L⁻¹ (LOD 0.51 mg L⁻¹). Readout is performed with a commercially available phase fluorimeter combined with optical fibers. Dual-lifetime referencing (DLR) is used as referencing method and Egyptian blue acts as an inert reference material. No cross-sensitivity to pH changes can be detected.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonia 3aanalytical chemistry 3abioprocessing 3adyes 3aemulsions 3afluorescence 3ahydrogels 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3apH 3apolydimethylsiloxane 3apolytetrafluoroethylene 3apolyurethanes1 aRieger, Veronika1 aMayr, Torsten0 tAnalytical and bioanalytical chemistry.g2020 Nov., v. 412, no. 27 p.7559-7567dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3870029x1618-26427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00216-020-02891-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02583naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245009300153300001800246520136400264592002801628650001301656650003001669650001501699650002501714650002101739650001401760650001301774650000901787650001801796650001301814700001201827700001401839700001501853700001701868700001701885700001501902700001901917773014201936856007402078852000902152655001202161IND60671075220221120115950.0191002e20150428xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067107522DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ta01003a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJi, Xiao10aDifferent charge-storage mechanisms in disulfide vanadium and vanadium carbide monolayer  ap. 9909-9914.  aTwo-dimensional (2D) transition-metal (TM) compound nanomaterials, due to their high-surface-area and large potential charge capability of TM atoms, have been widely investigated as electrochemical capacitors. However, the understanding of charge-storage mechanisms of 2D transition-metal compounds as electrode materials is still limited. In this study, using density functional theory computations, we systematically investigate the electrochemical properties of monolayer VS₂ and V₂C. Their electronic structures show a significant electron storage capability of around 0.25 V, referenced to the standard hydrogen electrode, and indicate redox pseudocapacitance characteristics as cathodes. The different charge densities visually confirm that excess electrons tend to localize in the vanadium atoms nearby contact-adsorbed Li ions, corresponding to the redox of vanadium atoms. In contrast, only the electric double layer acts as a charge-storage mechanism in the V₂C monolayer. However, the O saturation would induce redox pseudocapacitance in the V₂C monolayer. Furthermore, the calculated metallic behavior and low Li ion diffusion barriers substantiate that V₂C and VS₂ monolayers would manifest low resistance in the charging process. Our findings provide insights for the different charge-storage mechanism of VS₂ and V₂C monolayers.  aPublisher supplied data 3acathodes 3adensity functional theory 3adisulfides 3aelectrical equipment 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrons 3ahydrogen 3aions 3ananomaterials 3avanadium1 aXu, Kui1 aChen, Chi1 aZhang, Bao1 aWan, Houzhao1 aRuan, Yunjun1 aMiao, Ling1 aJiang, Jianjun0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2015 Apr. 28, v. 3, no. 18 p.9909-9914dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ta01003a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02600naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245009800157300002000255520142300275592002801698650001401726650001501740650001601755650001801771650001801789650002201807650001101829650001601840650002001856650001601876650001201892650003101904650001301935700001901948700001401967773013701981856007502118852000902193655001202202IND60537573020221118072055.0160809e20130911xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053757302DNAL7 a10.1021/ie401882w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Huanhao10aCatalytic Combustion of Volatile Organic Compounds over a Structured Zeolite Membrane Reactor  ap. 12819-12826.  aA novel structured zeolite membrane reactor based on a Cu–Mn (1:6)/ZSM-5/PSSF catalyst was developed for catalytic combustion of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). First, the ZSM-5 membrane/PSSF (paper-like sintered stainless steel fibers) composite was fabricated by the wet layup papermaking/sintering process and secondary growth process. The copper/manganese binary oxides modified ZSM-5 membrane catalyst was synthesized by an incipient wetness impregnation method. Catalytic combustion of VOCs in single and binary components was investigated over these structured zeolite membrane reactors using different gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) (3822–11466 h–¹). Results showed that the complete destruction of isopropyl alcohol or ethyl acetate in a single component can be achieved below the temperature of 300 °C. The study exhibited that the presence of toluene in the binary mixture had a slight effect on the conversion of isopropyl alcohol or ethyl acetate. Isopropyl alcohol and ethyl acetate were found to be more reactive than toluene in the binary mixture. A higher temperature above 300 °C was needed to totally destroy toluene in the binary mixture. The structured zeolite membrane reactor exhibited a relatively lower bed pressure drop, excellent reaction stability, reasonable mass/heat transfer efficiency, and excellent contacting efficiency as well as relatively lower diffusion resistance.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3acombustion 3aengineering 3aethyl acetate 3aheat transfer 3aisopropyl alcohol 3aoxides 3apapermaking 3astainless steel 3atemperature 3atoluene 3avolatile organic compounds 3azeolites1 aZhang, Huiping1 aYan, Ying0 tIndustrial & Engineering Chemistry Research.g2013 Sept. 11, v. 52, no. 36 p.12819-12826dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fie401882w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02006naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245011200167300001600279520072400295592002801019650001501047650001301062650001401075650001501089650001201104650001001116650001001126650001101136650001301147650001201160650001501172651001601187653001301203653001801216653001001234653002601244653002701270653001801297653001301315700001501328773011201343856008401455852000901539655001201548IND60122530920221119163709.0150325e20141002xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012253092DNAL7 a10.2989/16085914.2014.9824992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTweddle, D.,10aEvidence for lacustrine breeding by sanjika Opsaridium microcephalum (Teleostei: Cyprinidae) in Lake Malawi  ap. 479-480.  aThree species of Opsaridium occur in the Lake Malawi catchment. The kabyabya Opsaridium tweddleorum is a small species restricted to inflowing rivers and streams, the mpasa Opsaridium microlepis is a large lake-dwelling species that ascends the lower reaches of inflowing rivers during the rains to spawn, and the sanjika Opsaridium microcephalum has riverine, potamodromous and lake spawning populations. Evidence for sanjika spawning in the lake itself, rather than just in rivers, is presented here in the form of observations of courting behaviour by fully mature males and females on exposed rocky shores, together with the presence of pin-head fry in areas remote from any inflowing streams during the dry season.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCyprinidae 3abreeding 3acourtship 3adry season 3afemales 3alakes 3amales 3arivers 3aspawning 3astreams 3awatersheds 3aLake Malawi 0akabyabya 0aLeast Concern 0ampasa 0aOpsaridium microlepis 0aOpsaridium tweddleorum 0apotamodromous 0aRed Data1 aTurner, GF0 tAfrican journal of aquatic science.g2014 Oct. 2, v. 39, no. 4 p.479-480dTaylor & Francisx1727-93647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2989/16085914.2014.9824993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03378naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245014300169300001800312500001900330520188700349592002802236650001702264650001302281650002502294650002302319650001502342650002102357650001502378650001502393650002902408650001702437650001302454650001302467650001502480650001102495650001602506650002102522650001002543650001302553700002102566700001802587700002302605700001702628773014802645856008202793852000902875655001202884IND60712267920221118061130.0201009e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071226792DNAL7 a10.1007/s00216-020-02888-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLandmesser, Anne12aA novel quantification method for sulfur-containing biomarkers of formaldehyde and acetaldehyde exposure in human urine and plasma samples  ap. 7535-7546.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aA novel method for the quantification of the sulfur-containing metabolites of formaldehyde (thiazolidine carboxylic acid (TCA) and thiazolidine carbonyl glycine (TCG)) and acetaldehyde (methyl thiazolidine carboxylic acid (MTCA) and methyl thiazolidine carbonyl glycine (MTCG)) was developed and validated for human urine and plasma samples. Targeting the sulfur-containing metabolites of formaldehyde and acetaldehyde in contrast to the commonly used biomarkers formate and acetate overcomes the high intra- and inter-individual variance. Due to their involvement in various endogenous processes, formate and acetate lack the required specificity for assessing the exposure to formaldehyde and acetaldehyde, respectively. Validation was successfully performed according to FDA’s Guideline for Bioanalytical Method Validation (2018), showing excellent performance with regard to accuracy, precision, and limits of quantification (LLOQ). TCA, TCG, and MTCG proved to be stable under all investigated conditions, whereas MTCA showed a depletion after 21 months. The method was applied to a set of pilot samples derived from smokers who consumed unfiltered cigarettes spiked with ¹³C-labeled propylene glycol and ¹³C-labeled glycerol. These compounds were used as potential precursors for the formation of ¹³C-formaldehyde and ¹³C-acetaldehyde during combustion. Plasma concentrations were significantly lower as compared to urine, suggesting urine as suitable matrix for a biomonitoring. A smoking-related increase of unlabeled biomarker concentrations could not be shown due to the ubiquitous distribution in the environment. While the metabolites of ¹³C-acetaldehyde were not detected, the described method allowed for the quantification of ¹³C-formaldehyde uptake from cigarette smoking by targeting the biomarkers ¹³C-TCA and ¹³C-TCG in urine.Graphical abstract  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetaldehyde 3aacetates 3aanalytical chemistry 3aanalytical methods 3abiomarkers 3acarboxylic acids 3acigarettes 3acombustion 3aenvironmental monitoring 3aformaldehyde 3aformates 3aglycerol 3aguidelines 3ahumans 3ametabolites 3apropylene glycol 3aurine 3avariance1 aScherer, Gerhard1 aPluym, Nikola1 aNiessner, Reinhard1 aScherer, Max0 tAnalytical and bioanalytical chemistry.g2020 Nov., v. 412, no. 27 p.7535-7546dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3870029x1618-26427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00216-020-02888-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02584naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245009600165300001600261500001500277520114400292592002801436650002001464650000901484650001701493650001601510650001701526650002601543650001601569650002301585650001101608650002101619650001901640650001501659650001101674650000901685650001601694650003401710653001701744653002201761700001801783700002301801700002001824700002401844700001801868773010201886856008101988852000902069655001202078IND60082053520221118160554.0141016e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008205352DNAL7 a10.1007/s11829-014-9325-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVeromann, Eve10aFatal attraction: search for a dead-end trap crop for the pollen beetle (Meligethes aeneus)  ap. 373-381.  a2019-12-06  aIn sustainable pest management, orientation of insect pests can be manipulated by utilizing the relative attractiveness of different host plants. Plants attractive for oviposition but not offering a suitable resource for the development of larvae are called dead-end trap crops. In this study, the number of eggs and larvae and larval survival of Meligethes aeneus (Fab.) in the buds of Brassica napus L., B. rapa L., B. nigra L., B. juncea L., Eruca sativa Mill., Raphanus sativus Pers. and Sinapis alba L. were compared in 2011 and 2012. Overall infestation rate of buds varied from 0 to 71 %; the least attractive plants were S. alba and E. sativa. Egg clutch size per bud was greater on B. nigra and lower on S. alba and E. sativa than on B. napus. Dead larvae were found only in E. sativa and R. sativus buds. Over the two study years, 19 % of larvae on E. sativa and 35 % on R. sativus were dead. In conclusion, M. aeneus preferred to oviposit on Brassica species rather than on cruciferous plants from the other genera. In addition, R. sativus has the features of dead-end trap crop because 35 % of the larvae failed to survive.  aPublisher supplied data 3apest management 3abuds 3ainsect pests 3aoviposition 3aSinapis alba 3aBrassicogethes aeneus 3ahost plants 3alarval development 3apollen 3aRaphanus sativus 3aBrassica napus 3atrap crops 3alarvae 3aeggs 3aclutch size 3aEruca vesicaria subsp. sativa 0aEruca sativa 0aMeligethes aeneus1 aKaasik, Riina1 aKovacs, Gabriella,1 aMetspalu, Luule1 aWilliams, Ingrid H.1 aMänd, Marika0 tArthropod-plant interactions.g2014 Oct., v. 8, no. 5 p.373-381dSpringer-Verlagx1872-88557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11829-014-9325-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03152naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245013800170300001600308520192800324592002802252650001202280650001502292650002102307650001202328650001902340650002202359650005002381650001502431650002102446651001102467700002102478700001902499700002002518700002302538700001902561773011702580856004802697852000902745655001202754IND50068686420221121024157.0130821e201011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006868642DNAL7 a10.1007/s10661-009-1243-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWulder, Michael A.10aMultiscale satellite and spatial information and analysis framework in support of a large-area forest monitoring and inventory update  ap. 417-433.  aMany countries undertake a national forest inventory to enable statistically valid monitoring in support of national and international reporting of forest conditions and change. Canada’s National Forest Inventory (NFI) program is designed to operate on a 10-year remeasurement cycle, with an interim report produced at the 5-year mid-point. The NFI is a sample-based inventory, with approximately 18,850 2 ×2-km photo plots across the country, distributed on a 20×20-km grid of sample points; these photo plots are the primary data source for the NFI. Capacity to provide annual monitoring information is required to keep policy and decision makers apprised of current forest conditions. In this study, we implemented a multistage monitoring framework and used a Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) change product to successfully identify 78% of the changes in forest cover area that were captured with a Landsat change detection approach. Of the NFI photo plots that were identified by both the Landsat and MODIS approaches as having changes in forest cover, the proportion of change area within the plots was similar (R ² = 0.78). Approximately 70% of the Landsat-derived change events occupied less than 40% of a single MODIS pixel, and more than 90% of the change events of this size were successfully detected with the MODIS product. Finally, MODIS estimates of the proportion of forest cover change at the NFI photo plot level were comparable to change estimates for the ecoregions as a whole (R ² = 0.95). High-temporal, low-spatial resolution imagery such as MODIS, in combination with other remotely sensed data sources, can provide information on disturbance events within a national forest inventory remeasurement cycle, thereby satisfying the interim information needs of policy and decision makers as well as the requirements of national and international reporting commitments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3aecoregions 3aforest inventory 3aforests 3aimage analysis 3aissues and policy 3amoderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer 3amonitoring 3anational forests 3aCanada1 aWhite, Joanne C.1 aGillis, M.

Field experiments were established on a poorly drained Brimley silt loam (fine-loamy, mixed, frigid Alfic Haplaquods) in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan and on an irrigated Hubbard loamy sand (sandy, mixed Udorthentic Haploborolls) in east central Minnesota to determine response of Norcen and Viking cultivars to P and K. Plots were seeded at 2 and 10 lb/acre for seed and forage production, respectively. Factorial combinations of P and K were applied annually at each site, 0 to 13 lb P/acre with 0 to 280 lb K/acre in Minnesota and 0 to 22 lb P/acre with 0 to 80 lb K/acre in Michigan. Added fertilizer improved stands and forage yield in only a few cases. Applied P improved stands of Norcen on the poorly drained soil, but effects did not carry over in production years. Stand establishment was not affected by applied K. Forage yields on the loamy sand were not improved by applied K when soil test levels in August exceeded 126 lb K/acre. Added fertilizer K could be accounted for in exchangeable soil K in the uppermost 6 in., K removed in harvested forage, and estimated K contained in roots. Soil test levels of K increased rapidly (0.73 lb exchangeable soil K/1.0 lb fertilizer K) when K fertilizer additions exceeded K removal in forage. Forage yield did not improve with added P, although Bray-1 extractable P was as low as 21 lb/acre in the upper 6 in. of soil. No effects of fertilizer were observed for seed yield or winter survival.  aPublisher supplied data 3acultivars 3asandy soils 3apotassium fertilizers 3anutrients 3aphosphorus fertilizers 3airrigated soils 3aforage 3acrop yield 3asilt loam soils 3aLotus corniculatus 3aimpeded drainage 3aapplication rate 3abiogeochemical cycles 3aMichigan 3aMinnesota 0acrop production1 aMcGraw, R.

The partially hydrolyzed PVAcs, that is, poly(vinyl acetate-co-alcohol) [P(VAc-co-VA)], having degrees of hydrolysis of 5.2 and 9.6% were used as the macromolecular multifunctional initiator. The chemical structure and crystallization behavior of PVAc-g-PLLA were investigated. Graft length and density in PVAc-g-PLLA can be controlled by varying the lactide/P(VAc-co-VA) feed ratio and the degree of hydrolysis of P(VAc-co-VA). Graft length of PLLA chain and molecular weight of graft copolymer increased with the lactide/P(VAc-co-VA) feed ratio. The graft length and density of PVAc-g-PLLA had a significant effect on its crystallization behavior. The crystallization and spherulitic growth of PVAc-g-PLLA were decelerated with decreasing the length of PLLA graft chain or increasing the graft density, due to the branching effects and dilution effects of PVAc. The graft copolymer with shorter graft length and higher graft density showed disordered spherulites during crystallization, due to the structural defects in the crystal growth caused by branching. This study offers a new route for preparing the comb-like graft copolymers of PLLA with controllable graft length and density.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodegradability 3abranching 3achemical structure 3acomposite polymers 3acrystallization 3aengineering 3ahydrolysis 3amolecular weight 3apolymerization 3apolyvinyl acetate1 aShentu, Baoqing1 aPan, Pengju1 aShan, Guorong1 aBao, Yongzhong1 aWeng, Zhixue0 tIndustrial & Engineering Chemistry Research.g2013 Sept. 11, v. 52, no. 36 p.12897-12905dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fie401958m3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02738naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245013300177300001600310520103100326592002801357650001401385650001201399650001901411650001501430650002501445650002001470650001201490650001401502650002301516650001201539650001801551650001501569650002501584650002401609650001501633650000701648650001301655650002001668650001601688650001101704653000801715653000801723653000701731653001801738653001701756653002101773653002901794653002601823653001101849700001901860700002401879700002201903773011601925856008602041852000902127655001202136IND60524600320221120231545.0190408e20161115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052460032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.indcrop.2016.06.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdetunji, Adeoluwa I.10aComplementary effects of cell wall degrading enzymes together with lactic acid fermentation on cassava tuber cell wall breakdown  ap. 110-117.  aEntrapment of starch granules within cassava parenchyma cells constitutes a major challenge in starch extraction from cassava tuber. This was addressed by applying cellulolytic and hemicellulolytic enzymes coupled with spontaneous lactic acid bacteria fermentation in the pre-treatment of wet milled cassava. The hydrolytic activities of the enzymes and pH lowering by the fermentation resulted in fragmentation of the cassava cell walls, with an improved release of free starch granules. The residual cell wall material after the treatments was characterized by microscopy and gas chromatography. Lignified material was resistant to hydrolysis. Material that was not hydrolysed by the enzymes consisted of arabinose, galactose, rhamnose, xylose and glucose, with the latter two the most abundant. It appears that the gums and hemicelluloses were hydrolysed first, enabling subsequent hydrolysis of the cellulosic materials. The complementary effects of these treatments could improve wet milling extraction of cassava starch.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarabinose 3acassava 3acassava starch 3acell walls 3acellulosic materials 3aenzyme activity 3aenzymes 3agalactose 3agas chromatography 3aglucose 3ahemicellulose 3ahydrolysis 3alactic acid bacteria 3alactic fermentation 3amicroscopy 3apH 3arhamnose 3astarch granules 3awet milling 3axylose 0aCWM 0aLAB 0aTA 0aCassava tuber 0aCellulolytic 0aHemicellulolytic 0aLactic acid fermentation 0aParenchyma cell walls 0aStarch1 adu Clou, Heidi1 aWalford, Stephen N.1 aTaylor, John R.N.0 tIndustrial crops and products.g2016 Nov. 15, v. 90 p.110-117dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49222x0926-66907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2016.06.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02464naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024002200117024001900139040001800158100001900176245015400195300001500349520113000364592002801494650001501522650001301537650000901550650002501559650001701584650001201601650004501613650001301658700003101671700002101702773015201723856006901875856010201944990002302046852000902069655001202078IND60643189620221119132150.0190510e20181007xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064318962DNAL7 a10.3791/577332doi7 aPMC62354332pmcid7 a303463862pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDreisig, Karin10aRetinal cryo-sections, whole-mounts, and hypotonic isolated vasculature preparations for immunohistochemical visualization of microvascular pericytes  ap. e57733.  aRetinal pericytes play an important role in many diseases of the eye. Immunohistochemical staining techniques of retinal vessels and microvascular pericytes are central to ophthalmological research. It is vital to choose an appropriate method of visualizing the microvascular pericytes. We describe retinal microvascular pericyte immunohistochemical staining in cryo-sections, whole-mounts, and hypotonic isolated vasculature using antibodies for platelet-derived growth factor receptor β (PDGFRβ) and nerve/glial antigen 2 (NG2). This allows us to highlight advantages and shortcomings of each of the three tissue preparations for the visualization of the retinal microvascular pericytes. Cryo-sections provide transsectional visualization of all retinal layers but contain only a few occasional transverse cuts of the microvasculature. Whole-mount provides an overview of the entire retinal vasculature, but visualization of the microvasculature can be troublesome. Hypotonic isolation provides a method to visualize the entire retinal vasculature by the removal of neuronal cells, but this makes the tissue very fragile.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibodies 3aantigens 3aeyes 3aimmunohistochemistry 3anerve tissue 3aneurons 3aplatelet-derived growth factor receptors 3astaining1 aBlixt, Frank Wojciechowski1 aWarfvinge, Karin0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2018 Oct. 07, , no. 140 p.e57733-e57733dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/577333Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/57733/retinal-cryo-sections-whole-mounts-hypotonic-isolated-vasculature  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03196naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100003500154245010300189500001900292520149800311592002801809650001401837650002801851650002001879650001501899650001701914650001601931650001301947650001901960650001101979650001901990650001002009650002302019650000902042650002702051650001902078650001502097650001902112650001702131650001702148650001902165650001102184650002202195650001702217650001902234653002102253653002202274653001802296700002902314700003002343700002302373773012402396856008902520852000902609655001202618IND60705654020221119061457.0200824e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070565402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2020.1119842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMariadoss, Arokia Vijaya Anand10aPreparation, characterization and anti-cancer activity of graphene oxide‐‑silver nanocomposite  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis work reported the preparation, characterization, cytotoxicity of green synthesized Lespedeza cuneate mediated silver nanoparticles (Lc-AgNPs) and graphene oxide‑silver nanocomposite (GO-AgNComp) using Lc-AgNPs. The UV absorption spectrum at 419 nm indicated the successful formation of GO-AgNComp. The TEM analysis displayed the thin sheet of graphene decorated Lc-AgNPs in GO-AgNComp. Zeta potential was −13.2 mV for Lc-AgNPs and −30.5 mV for GO-AgNComp. The photothermal conversion efficiency was calculated as 31.09% for GO-AgNComp. The negatively charged zeta potential of GO-AgNComp enhanced its cellular penetration through enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. The near-infrared laser (NIR) induced the anticancer activity of Lc-AgNPs and GO-AgNComp in human lung cancer cells (A549) and brain tumour (LN229). The results indicated that about 50% of A549 cells and LN229 cells were ablated by treatment of 24.73 ± 2.98 μg/mL and 27.34 ± 1.62 μg/mL of Lc-AgNPs, as well by 15.46 ± 2.31 μg/mL and 20.95 ± 1.35 μg/mL of GO-AgNComp respectively. Moreover, GO-AgNComp was not cytotoxic to normal mouse fibroblast cells (NIH3T3), but it caused the cancer cell death in A549 and LN229 through ROS generation, nuclear damage, and mitochondrial membrane potential (∆ψm) loss. This work reported the anticancer potential of GO-AgNComp, which deserves further study on the molecular elucidation of GO-AgNComp mediated human lung and tumour therapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLespedeza 3aantineoplastic activity 3abrain neoplasms 3acell death 3acytotoxicity 3afibroblasts 3agraphene 3agraphene oxide 3ahumans 3alung neoplasms 3alungs 3amembrane potential 3amice 3amitochondrial membrane 3ananocomposites 3ananosilver 3aneoplasm cells 3apermeability 3aphotobiology 3aphotochemistry 3asilver 3aspectral analysis 3atherapeutics 3azeta potential 0aPhotothermolysis 0aLespedeza cuneata 0aNanocomposite1 aSaravanakumar, Kandasamy1 aSathiyaseelan, Anbazhagan1 aWang, Myeong-Hyeon0 tJournal of photochemistry and photobiology.g2020 Sept., v. 210 p.111984-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6193x1011-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2020.1119843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02213naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245011700160520112700277592002801404650001401432650002301446650001501469650001101484650001501495650002401510650002801534651001201562700002101574700002601595700002001621700001901641773012001660856007401780852000901854655001201863IND60702886420221121014639.0200719e20200119xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070288642DNAL7 a10.3390/f110101182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDang, Viet-Hung 12aA Novel GIS-Based Random Forest Machine Algorithm for the Spatial Prediction of Shallow Landslide Susceptibility  aThis study developed and verified a new hybrid machine learning model, named random forest machine (RFM), for the spatial prediction of shallow landslides. RFM is a hybridization of two state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, random forest classifier (RFC) and support vector machine (SVM), in which RFC is used to generate subsets from training data and SVM is used to build decision functions for these subsets. To construct and verify the hybrid RFM model, a shallow landslide database of the Lang Son area (northern Vietnam) was prepared. The database consisted of 101 shallow landslide polygons and 14 conditioning factors. The relevance of these factors for shallow landslide susceptibility modeling was assessed using the ReliefF method. Experimental results pointed out that the proposed RFM can help to achieve the desired prediction with an F1 score of roughly 0.96. The performance of the RFM was better than those of benchmark approaches, including the SVM, RFC, and logistic regression. Thus, the newly developed RFM is a promising tool to help local authorities in shallow landslide hazard mitigations.  aPublisher supplied data 3adatabases 3aforestry equipment 3alandslides 3amodels 3aprediction 3aregression analysis 3asupport vector machines 3aVietnam1 aHoang, Nhat-Duc 1 aNguyen, Le-Mai-Duyen 1 aTien Bui, Dieu,1 aSamui, Pijush 0 tForests.g2020 Jan. 19, v. 11, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f110101183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03696naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001400166245007800180300001800258520191900276592002802195650001402223650001702237650002202254650001102276650001602287650001402303650001102317650001402328650001002342650001502352650002002367650001202387650005202399650002202451650002302473650002302496650003102519650002902550650007202579650004602651650002102697650002702718650005202745700001402797700001302811700001502824700001402839700001502853700001802868700001502886773011502901856008103016852000903097655001203106IND50074248120221121183357.0150121e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007424812DNAL7 a236741542pmid7 a10.1007/s00253-013-4969-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHou, Jing10aCharacterization of genes for chitin catabolism in Haloferax mediterranei  ap. 1185-1194.  aChitin is the second most abundant natural polysaccharide after cellulose. But degradation of chitin has never been reported in haloarchaea. In this study, we revealed that Haloferax mediterranei, a metabolically versatile haloarchaeon, could utilize colloidal or powdered chitin for growth and poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV) accumulation, and the gene cluster (HFX_5025-5039) for the chitin catabolism pathway was experimentally identified. First, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction results showed that the expression of the genes encoding the four putative chitinases (ChiAHₘₑ, ChiBHₘₑ, ChiCHₘₑ, and ChiDHₘₑ, HFX_5036-5039), the LmbE-like deacetylase (DacHₘₑ, HFX_5027), and the glycosidase (GlyAHₘₑ, HFX_5029) was induced by colloidal or powdered chitin, and chiAHₘₑ, chiBHₘₑ, and chiCHₘₑwere cotranscribed. Knockout of chiABCHₘₑor chiDHₘₑhad a significant effect on cell growth and PHBV production when chitin was used as the sole carbon source, and the chiABCDHₘₑknockout mutant lost the capability to utilize chitin. Knockout of dacHₘₑor glyAHₘₑalso decreased PHBV accumulation on chitin. These results suggested that ChiABCDHₘₑ, DacHₘₑ, and GlyAHₘₑwere indeed involved in chitin degradation in H. mediterranei. Additionally, the chitinase assay showed that each chitinase possessed hydrolytic activity toward colloidal or powdered chitin, and the major product of colloidal chitin hydrolysis by ChiABCDHₘₑwas diacetylchitobiose, which was likely further degraded to monosaccharides by DacHₘₑ, GlyAHₘₑ, and other related enzymes for both cell growth and PHBV biosynthesis. Taken together, this study revealed the genes and enzymes involved in chitin catabolism in haloarchaea for the first time and indicated the potential of H. mediterranei as a whole-cell biocatalyst in chitin bioconversion.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHaloferax 3abiosynthesis 3abiotransformation 3acarbon 3acell growth 3acellulose 3achitin 3achitinase 3agenes 3ahydrolysis 3amonosaccharides 3amutants 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 2aBiotransformation 2aCarbonxmetabolism 2aChitinxmetabolism 2aGene Expression Profiling. 2aGene Knockout Techniques 2aHaloferax mediterraneixenzymologyxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aMetabolic Networks and Pathwaysxgenetics 2aMultigene Family 2aPolyestersxmetabolism 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction1 aHan, Jing1 aCai, Lei1 aZhou, Jian1 aLu, Yang,1 aJin, Cheng1 aLiu, Jingfang1 aXiang, Hua0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2014 Feb., v. 98, no. 3 p.1185-1194dSpringer-Verlagx0175-75987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-013-4969-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03140naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092040001800122100001800140245005400158300001600212500000900228500001500237520190100252592002802153650001402181650001602195650002202211650002102233650001502254650002202269650001702291650002402308650001902332651001102351653001802362700002102380700001902401773020102420852000902621856007702630990002302707655001202730IND2048440620221120181054.0191122e199010  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204844062DNAL7 a10.2134/jpa1990.05762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDuncan, S.

Merr.] into winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in areas of Kansas where length of growing season and inadequate rainfall limit the productivity of doublecropped soybeans. Objectives of the study were to: (i) examine the response of soybean and wheat cultivars to solid and skip-row planting patterns, and (ii) compare soybean and wheat performance when planted in monocropped and intercropped systems across a range of environments. Winter wheat cultivars Agripro ‘Mustang’ and Pioneer ‘2157’ were planted in 10-in. rows in a solid and one-out-of-three skip-row pattern at six environments in northern and western Kansas in 1985 and 1986. All but one environment was irrigated. Soybean cultivars ‘Sparks’, ‘Sherman’, and Asgrow ‘A3127’ were planted alone or intercropped into wheat at the late boot stage. Wheat yields in skip-row patterns were 13% lower than those in monocrop solid patterns, whereas intercropping soybeans into solid-seeded wheat reduced wheat yields 4%. Intercropped soybeans yielded 72% of monocropped soybeans. Soybean yields in the two intercropped planting patterns were similar, but there was a tendency for yields in the skip-row pattern to be greater than those in the solid planting pattern. No genotype X planting pattern interactions were observed for either crop. Relay intercropping did not appear to be a viable production option in far western kansas, where soybeans were less able to compete effectively with wheat. In eastern Kansas under dryland or irrigated conditions, or under irrigated conditions in the central part of the state, relay intercropping has the potential to increase gross returns over those of doublecropping or monocrop wheat production. Intercrop gross returns were only marginally higher than those for monocrop soybean production.  aPublisher supplied data 3acultivars 3aGlycine max 3acosts and returns 3aagronomic traits 3acrop yield 3aTriticum aestivum 3awinter wheat 3acontinuous cropping 3arelay cropping 3aKansas 0aintercropping1 aSchapaugh, W.

Physical rearrangements among parental genomes have hindered the development of linkage maps in this species. The objective of this work was to develop a single high‐density consensus linkage map that is representative of the majority of commonly grown oat varieties. Data from a cDNA‐derived single‐nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array and genotyping‐by‐sequencing (GBS) were collected from the progeny of 12 biparental recombinant inbred line populations derived from 19 parents representing oat germplasm cultivated primarily in North America. Linkage groups from all mapping populations were compared to identify 21 clusters of conserved collinearity. Linkage groups within each cluster were then merged into 21 consensus chromosomes, generating a framework consensus map of 7202 markers spanning 2843 cM. An additional 9678 markers were placed on this map with a lower degree of certainty. Assignment to physical chromosomes with high confidence was made for nine chromosomes. Comparison of homeologous regions among oat chromosomes and matches to orthologous regions of rice (Oryza sativa L.) reveal that the hexaploid oat genome has been highly rearranged relative to its ancestral diploid genomes as a result of frequent translocations among chromosomes. Heterogeneous chromosome rearrangements among populations were also evident, probably accounting for the failure of some linkage groups to match the consensus. This work contributes to a further understanding of the organization and evolution of hexaploid grass genomes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAvena sativa 3aOryza sativa 3achromosome mapping 3achromosome translocation 3achromosomes 3adiploidy 3aevolution 3agenome 3agenotyping by sequencing 3agermplasm 3agrasses 3ahexaploidy 3ainbred lines 3alinkage groups 3aoats 3aparents 3aprogeny 3arice 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3aNorth America1 aHuang, Yung‐Fen1 aSmith, Scott1 aBekele, Wubishet A.1 aBabiker, Ebrahiem1 aGnanesh, Belaghihalli N.1 aForesman, Bradley J.1 aBlanchard, Steven G.1 aJay, Jeremy J.1 aReid, Robert W.1 aWight, Charlene P.1 aChao, Shiaoman1 aOliver, Rebekah1 aIslamovic, Emir1 aKolb, Frederic L.1 aMcCartney, Curt1 aMitchell Fetch, Jennifer W.1 aBeattie, Aaron D.1 aBjørnstad, Åsmund,1 aBonman, J.

Compared with pure Pt(111) and Pt(100), the adsorptions of ORR intermediates are weakened on both Pt/Cu(111) and Pt/Cu(100) surfaces. The ORR follows the oxygen dissociation mechanism on Pt/Cu(100) which is the same as that on pure Pt(100). However, the ORR mechanism is the peroxyl dissociation mechanism on pure Pt(111), hydrogen peroxide dissociation on Pt/Cu(111). The rate determining step is OH + H⁺ + e⁻ → H₂O on Pt/Cu(100) and pure Pt(100), O + H⁺ + e⁻ → OH on pure Pt (111) and OOH + H⁺ + e⁻ → H₂O₂ on Pt/Cu(111). Compared with the energy barrier of the rate determining step on pure Pt(111) (0.86 eV) and Pt(100) (0.76 eV), the ORR reaction activity is improved on Pt/Cu(111) and hindered on Pt/Cu(100), with the barriers of 0.40 and 0.85 eV, respectively. For the effects of electric potential, OH protonation is favorable thermodynamically at a broad electrode potential (from 0 to 1.23 V) on the Pt/Cu(111) surface, in agreement with the high durability of Pt/Cu observed in experiments. The working potentials of Pt/Cu(111) and Pt/Cu(100) are predicted to be 0.39 and 0.73 V, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acopper 3adensity functional theory 3adissociation 3adurability 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aenergy 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aoxygen 3aplatinum 3aprotonation 3aprotons 3athermodynamics1 aLi, Yang1 aWang, Ying1 aHe, Feng1 aJiao, Menggai1 aTang, Hao1 aWu, Zhijian0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2015 May 19, v. 3, no. 21 p.11444-11452dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ta01017a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03221naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245016000170300001800330520178900348592002802137650002302165650003002188650001702218650003702235650001102272650001302283650001702296650001402313650000702327650001102334650002502345650002302370700002302393700002502416700001702441700006602458700006502524773011802589856008302707852000902790655001202799IND60626741020190418000000.0181226e20181130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062674102DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.biochem.8b010742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTramonti, Angela10aHuman Cytosolic and Mitochondrial Serine Hydroxymethyltransferase Isoforms in Comparison: Full Kinetic Characterization and Substrate Inhibition Properties  ap. 6984-6996.  aSerine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT) catalyzes the reversible conversion of l-serine and tetrahydrofolate into glycine and 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate. This enzyme, which plays a pivotal role in one-carbon metabolism, is involved in cancer metabolic reprogramming and is a recognized target of chemotherapy intervention. In humans, two isoforms of the enzyme exist, which are commonly termed cytosolic SHMT1 and mitochondrial SHMT2. Considerable attention has been paid to the structural, mechanistic, and metabolic features of these isozymes. On the other hand, a detailed comparison of their catalytic and regulatory properties is missing, although this aspect seems to be considerably important, considering that SHMT1 and SHMT2 reside in different cellular compartments, where they play distinct roles in folate metabolism. Here we performed a full kinetic characterization of the serine hydroxymethyltransferase reaction catalyzed by SHMT1 and SHMT2, with a focus on pH dependence and substrate inhibition. Our investigation, which allowed the determination of all kinetic parameters of serine hydroxymethyltransferase forward and backward reactions, uncovered a previously unobserved substrate inhibition by l-serine and highlighted several interesting differences between SHMT1 and SHMT2. In particular, SHMT2 maintains a pronounced tetrahydrofolate substrate inhibition even at the alkaline pH characteristic of the mitochondrial matrix, whereas with SHMT1 this is almost abolished. At this pH, SHMT2 also shows a catalytic efficiency that is much higher than that of SHMT1. These observations suggest that such different properties represent an adaptation of the isoforms to the respective cellular environments and that substrate inhibition may be a form of regulation.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalytic activity 3acellular microenvironment 3adrug therapy 3aglycine hydroxymethyltransferase 3ahumans 3aisozymes 3amitochondria 3aneoplasms 3apH 3aserine 3atetrahydrofolic acid 3avitamin metabolism1 aNardella, Caterina1 adi Salvo, Martino L.1 aBarile, Anna1 aCutruzzolà, Francesca1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4621-21351 aContestabile, Roberto1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5235-99930 tBiochemistry.g2018 Nov. 30, v. 57, no. 51 p.6984-6996dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19162x1520-49957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.8b010743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03822naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245010400173300001100277520220900288592002802497650002002525650001802545650002002563650002002583650002102603650001102624650001802635650001602653650001402669650001102683650001802694650002702712650001902739650002002758650002502778650001902803651001702822651002802839651001202867651001102879651001202890653001502902653001902917653001802936653001802954653001002972653001402982653001602996700002103012700002003033773009803053856008403151852000903235655001203244IND60122531720221119164452.0150325e20140102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012253172DNAL7 a10.1080/12538078.2013.8468742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCornille, Amandine10aNews of the Société Botanique de FrancebPhD research abstract Diversification of the genus Malus  ap. 11.  aDespite its economic, cultural and historical importance, few studies have investigated the evolutionary history of the domesticated apple (Malus domestica) as well as those of its wild relatives. Using new population genetic approaches (approximate Bayesian computation) with microsatellites and nuclear sequences, this thesis aimed to unravel, at different evolutionary scales (phylogeography, speciation, domestication), the natural and artificial diversification processes at play in the Malus genus. Research focused on the four wild apple species distributed across Eurasia [ Malus orientalis (Caucasus), Malus sieversii (Central Asia), Malus sylvestris (Europe) and Malus baccata (Siberia)] and on the single domesticated apple species in the genus, Malus domestica . The thesis was divided into four parts: (1) domestication history of the cultivated apple, from its origin in Central Asia to Europe, (2) post-glacial recolonization history of the European crabapple (M. sylvestris), (3) the history of speciation among the five Malus species, (4) crop-to-wild gene flow and dispersal capacities of the closest wild relative species (M. sylvestris , M. sieversii and M. orientalis). By investigating artificial diversification, we found evidence of unique processes of domestication in this fruit tree, with no bottleneck and with extensive post-domestication introgressions by a wild species (M. sylvestris) other than the ancestral progenitor (M. sieversii). Natural diversification patterns (phylogeography, speciation and population structure) revealed large effective population sizes, high dispersal capacities and weak spatial genetic structures. This thesis also revealed high levels of interspecific hybridizations, and a particularly high level of crop-to-wild gene flow in Europe and Central Asia. This study extended our knowledge of population structures for the wild species that contributed to the cultivated apple genome, as well as the extent of hybridization rates. This work is essential for the conservation of wild apple populations, the maintenance of the integrity of wild species facing fragmentation and future breeding programmes concerning the domesticated apple.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aMalus baccata 3aMalus domestica 3aMalus sieversii 3aMalus sylvestris 3aapples 3adomestication 3afruit trees 3agene flow 3agenome 3aintrogression 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aphylogeography 3apopulation size 3apopulation structure 3awild relatives 3aCentral Asia 3aCentral European region 3aEurasia 3aFrance 3aSiberia 0aspeciation 0aphylogeography 0ahybridization 0adomestication 0aapple 0aMalus sp. 0afruit trees1 aGladieux, Pierre1 aGiraud, Tatiana0 tActa botanica Gallica.g2014 Jan. 2, v. 161, no. 1 p.11-11dTaylor & Francisx2166-34087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/12538078.2013.8468743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02290naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245013100156300002000287520111400307592002801421650001201449650001401461650002301475650002001498650001501518650001601533650001901549650001301568650002801581650000901609650001501618700001501633700001901648700001601667773013701683856007501820852000901895655001201904IND60537573920221118072032.0160809e20130918xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053757392DNAL7 a10.1021/ie303487q2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Guowei10aResearch on Isobutane Dehydrogenation over Mo/MgAl2O4 Catalysts and Pilot-Scale Evaluation in a Circulating Fluidized-Bed Unit  ap. 13297-13304.  aIn this article, an environmentally friendly non-noble-metal class of Mo/MgAl₂O₄ catalysts is demonstrated to exhibit excellent performance in isobutane dehydrogenation. Results of activity tests indicated that an induction period is required for the catalysts to develop the active species. Further investigation revealed that high-valence-state Mo species are favorable for the initial oxidative reactions and Mo⁴⁺ ions are probably the actual active species for catalytic dehydrogenation. Given the strongly endothermic characteristics and rapid catalyst deactivation of alkane dehydrogenation, a circulating fluidized-bed unit was further applied to evaluate the activity and stability of the catalysts. To avoid undesired oxidative reactions and improve the initial catalytic activity, a flow of hydrogen was introduced into the pilot-scale unit to prereduce the catalysts prior to reaction. In general, the catalysts exhibited highly active and stable performance in the pilot-scale evaluation, with an isobutene yield of up to 35 wt %, demonstrating great potential for industrial applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3abutanes 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3adehydrogenation 3aendothermy 3aengineering 3afluidized beds 3ahydrogen 3aindustrial applications 3aions 3amolybdenum1 aLi, Chunyi1 aShan, Honghong1 aWu, Wenlong0 tIndustrial & Engineering Chemistry Research.g2013 Sept. 18, v. 52, no. 37 p.13297-13304dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fie303487q3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02800naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002300155245013600178520149700314592002801811650001601839650001801855650001401873650001801887650001901905650001801924650001801942653001601960653002701976653001302003653001702016653002102033653002402054700002002078700006002098700001902158700002302177773009102200856009002291852000902381655001202390IND60756418720221117220933.0220124e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075641872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1328112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhan, Sher Bahadar10aAlginate biopolymer as a reactor container for copper oxide-tin oxide: Efficient nanocatalyst for reduction of different pollutants  aThe need of clean water demands to design an efficient catalytic system with high effective and selective reduction of water pollutants. Here, we successfully prepared copper oxide-tin oxide (CuO–SnO₂) nanomaterial and further wrapped in Na-alginate hydrogel (Alg/CuO–SnO₂). CuO–SnO₂ and Alg/CuO–SnO₂ were characterized by FESEM, EDS, FTIR-ATR, and XRD and tested for the reduction of water pollutants. The catalytic ability of CuO–SnO₂ and Alg/CuO–SnO₂ was examined for numerous pollutants like 4-nitrophenol (4-NP), methyl orange (MO), congo red (CR), methylene blue (MB) and potassium ferricyanide (K₃[Fe(CN)₆]) where the designed CuO–SnO₂ and Alg/CuO–SnO₂ nanocatalysts were most selective toward MB reduction. Further on optimization of catalyst amount, stability, and reducing agent amount, it was found that the increase of nanocatalyst amount and NaBH₄ concentration increase the rate of MB reduction. CuO–SnO₂ and Alg/CuO–SnO₂ nanocatalysts reduced MB in 3.0 min with reaction rate constants (kₐₚₚ) of 1.2944 min⁻¹ and 1.2715 min⁻¹, respectively. Additionally, Alg/CuO–SnO₂ nanocatalyst was easily recovered by simply pulling hydrogel after completion of reaction and reused four times with no loss in efficiency. Besides, Alg/CuO–SnO₂ nanocatalyst was further investigated in real samples like sea water, irrigation water, well water, university wastewater and found effective for MB reduction even in real samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiopolymers 3aferricyanides 3ahydrogels 3amethyl orange 3amethylene blue 3ananocatalysts 3ap-nitrophenol 0aNa-alginate 0aCopper oxide-tin oxide 0aHydrogel 0aNanocatalyst 0aWater pollutants 0aCatalytic reduction1 aAkhtar, Kalsoom1 aBakhsh, Esraa M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3644-41431 aKamal, Tahseen1 aAsiri, Abdullah M.0 tChemosphere.g2022 Mar., v. 291 p.132811-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1328113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02595naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004600113024003500159040001800194100001500212245007200227300001600299506007600315520127500391592002801666506003701694650001101731650001801742650000901760650001701769650001101786650001001797650001201807650001301819650000901832650001001841650002001851650001101871651001001882700001501892700001701907700001901924773010401943856008102047852000902128655001202137IND60082054420221207140326.0141016e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008205442DNAL7 a253204972pmid7 aPMC4185042 [Available on 12/01/15]2pmcid7 a10.1007/s12639-013-0264-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGodara, R.10aEpidemiology of paramphistomosis in sheep and goats in Jammu, India  ap. 423-428.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aEpidemiology of paramphistomosis in sheep and goats was studied using field and abattoir samples at Jammu, India. Abattoir examination revealed that 36.2 % of sheep and 30.9 % of goats were positive for paramphistomosis. The mean worm counts (±SEM) were 23.5 ± 5.7 in sheep and 19.9 ± 3.5 in goats. On coprological examination, 16.3 % of sheep and 13.6 % of goats were found positive for paramphistomosis. The mean egg counts (±SEM) were 4.4 ± 2.6 in sheep and 3.6 ± 2.1 in goats. Season was found to have a significant (p < 0.05) influence on the prevalence of paramphistomosis. A higher percentage of animals were found positive in rainy and post-rainy seasons as compared with summer and winter seasons. The distributions of eggs and adult flukes were significantly (p < 0.01) different among seasons. The prevalences observed according to age and sex of sheep and goats were not significant. The study conclude that the late summer months are major risk period for paramphistomosis in the pasture grazing sheep and goats and the administration of an efficient anthelmintic in May–June and September–October should be strongly recommended to reduce the infection and minimise the perpetuating financial losses to animal owners in the region.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadults 3aanthelmintics 3aeggs 3aepidemiology 3aflukes 3agoats 3agrazing 3apastures 3arisk 3asheep 3aslaughterhouses 3asummer 3aIndia1 aKatoch, R.1 aYadav, Anish1 aRastogi, Ankur0 tJournal of parasitic diseases.g2014 Dec., v. 38, no. 4 p.423-428dSpringer-Verlagx0971-71967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12639-013-0264-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04256naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245012500165300001600290500001900306520251800325592002802843650001102871650001302882650001802895650001402913650001602927650001602943650001302959650001502972650001902987650001603006650001303022650001303035650001603048650001703064650001203081650002503093650001103118650001003129650001303139650000903152650001303161650001903174650001803193650001803211650001603229650001103245650001703256653002203273653002003295653003103315653001303346700001703359700001603376773014603392856008303538852000903621655001203630IND60697710020221123014538.0200621e20200813xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069771002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.05.1942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Xinyuan10aEffects of leptin on HPG axis and reproductive function in male rat in simulated altitude of 5500 m hypoxia environment  ap. 104-111.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aHigh altitude hypobaric hypoxia environment impairs male’s reproductive function. Leptin is an adipose tissue-derived hormone which regulates body weight homeostasis. Its receptor (LepR) has been found in all levels of male reproductive axis, indicating that it can affect male reproductive system in a direct or (and) indirect way. However, the role of leptin signaling in hypobaric hypoxia induced male reproductive dysfunction remains to be elucidated. In this study, we investigated the changes of leptin levels in male SD rats in stimulated altitude of 5500 m hypobaric hypoxia environment and their effects on the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonad axis (HPG axis). A hypoxia animal model was established using a hypobaric hypoxia chamber. Rats were divided randomly into 1, 7, 14, 28-day hypoxia group, recovery group (14 days hypoxia+14 days normoxia) and their control groups. Hypoxia groups displayed obvious changes of testicular and epididymis index compared to control groups. The total number of sperm and sperm motility rate decreased dramatically, while sperm deformity rate increased in hypoxia groups. The flow cytometry analysis showed that the percentage of haploid in 1-day, 7-day and 28-day hypoxia groups increased while the proportion of diploid decreased in 14-day and 28-day hypoxia group. TUNEL staining showed that the testis cells apoptosis index (AI) of hypoxia groups increased significantly, and the apoptosis of cells mainly focus on spermatogonia and spermatocytes. The expression of GnRH in hypothalamus decreased dramatically under hypoxia condition, accompanied with the reduction of serum testosterone (T) level in 1-day and 28-day hypoxia groups and free-testosterone level (FT) in 1-day and 14-day hypoxia groups. Importantly, ELISA analysis showed that serum leptin level decreased in 7-day hypoxia groups and acylated-ghrelin, gastrin also changed, accompanying with reduction of LepR in hypothalamus in hypoxia groups. Immunohistochemical staining exhibited increased leptin and LepR in testis under hypobaric hypoxia conditions. Our results suggested that simulated high altitude hypobaric hypoxia environment decreased male reproductive function, depressed HPG axis activity and altered the serum concentration of hormones related to food intake in adult male rats. Additionally, hypobaric hypoxia induced the leptin-LepR expression in adult male rats’ testis, suggesting leptin-LepR signaling may mediate hypoxia-induced impairment in male rats’ reproductive system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aaltitude 3aanimal models 3aapoptosis 3ablood serum 3abody weight 3adiploidy 3aepididymis 3aflow cytometry 3afood intake 3agastrins 3ahaploidy 3ahomeostasis 3ahypothalamus 3ahypoxia 3aimmunohistochemistry 3aleptin 3amales 3anormoxia 3arats 3aresearch 3asperm motility 3aspermatocytes 3aspermatogonia 3aspermatozoa 3atestes 3atestosterone 0aHypobaric hypoxia 0aLeptin receptor 0aMale reproductive function 0aHPG axis1 aLiu, Shiying1 aXu, Chengli0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2020 Aug. 13, v. 529, no. 1 p.104-111dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.05.1943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02661naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245012200163300001600285520159300301592002801894650002001922650001501942650001301957650002401970650002201994653002002016653003802036653002502074700002202099773013102121856007402252852000902326655001202335IND60624533420221119004812.0181204e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062453342DNAL7 a10.1093/bib/bbv0952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKlein, Hans-Ulrich13aAn evaluation of methods to test predefined genomic regions for differential methylation in bisulfite sequencing data  ap. 796-807.  aIn the biology of tissue development and diseases, DNA methylation plays an important role. For a deeper understanding, it is crucial to accurately compare DNA methylation patterns between groups of samples representing different conditions. A widely used method to investigate DNA methylation in the CpG context is bisulfite sequencing, which produces data on the single-nucleotide scale. While there are benefits to analyzing CpG sites on a basepair level, there are both biological and statistical reasons to test entire genomic regions for differential methylation. However, the analysis of DNA methylation is hampered by the lack of best practice standards. Here, we compared multiple approaches for testing predefined genomic regions for differential DNA methylation in bisulfite sequencing data. Nine methods were evaluated: BiSeq, COHCAP, Goeman's Global Test, Limma, methylKit/eDMR, RADMeth and three log-linear regression approaches with different distribution assumptions. We applied these methods to simulated data and determined their sensitivity and specificity. This revealed performance differences, which were also seen when applied to real data. Methods that first test single CpG sites and then test regions based on transformed CpG-wise P-values performed better than methods that summarize methylation levels or raw reads. Interestingly, smoothing of methylation levels had a negligible impact. In particular, Global Test, BiSeq and RADMeth/z-test outperformed the other methods we evaluated, providing valuable guidance for more accurate analysis of DNA methylation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA methylation 3abisulfites 3agenomics 3aregression analysis 3asequence analysis 0aDNA methylation 0aDifferentially methylated regions 0aBisulfite sequencing1 aHebestreit, Katja0 tBriefings in bioinformatics.g2016 Sept., v. 17, no. 5 p.796-807dOxford University PresswJournal:J000001269x1477-40547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/bib/bbv0953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02680naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245016300163300001600326500001900342520129700361592002801658650001201686650001301698650002301711650003001734650002001764650001301784650001901797653000901816653002501825653002001850653001601870653000901886653001001895700001901905700001801924700001401942700002001956700002001976773014601996856008302142852000902225655001202234IND60697710120221123014510.0200621e20200730xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069771012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.05.1972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZheng, Mei12aA novel molecular mechanism responsible for phosphorylation-independent desensitization of G protein-coupled receptors exemplified by the dopamine D3 receptor  ap. 432-439.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aGRK-mediated receptor phosphorylation followed by association with β-arrestins has been proposed to be the molecular mechanism involved in the desensitization of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). However, this mechanism does not explain the desensitization of some GPCRs, such as dopamine D₃ receptor (D₃R), which does not undergo GRK-mediated phosphorylation. Loss-of-function approaches and mutants of dopamine D₂ receptor and D₃R, which exhibit different desensitization properties, were used to identify the cellular components and processes responsible for desensitization. D₃R mediated the recruitment of Mdm2 to the cytosol, which resulted in the constitutive ubiquitination of β-arrestin2 in the resting state. Under desensitization conditions, cytosolic Mdm2 returned to the nucleus, resulting in the deubiquitination of cytosolic β-arrestins. Deubiquitinated β-arrestins formed a tight complex with Gβγ, thereby sequestering it, causing interference in D₃R signaling. In conclusion, this study shows that β-arrestins, depending on their ubiquitination status, control the G protein cycling by regulating their interactions with Gβγ. This is a novel mechanism proposed to explain how certain GPCRs can undergo desensitization without receptor phosphorylation.  aPublisher supplied data 3acytosol 3adopamine 3adopamine receptors 3aloss-of-function mutation 3aphosphorylation 3aresearch 3aubiquitination 0aGPCR 0aDopamine D3 receptor 0aDesensitization 0aβ-Arrestin 0aMdm2 0aGβγ1 aZhang, Xiaohan1 aSun, Ningning1 aMin, Xiao1 aAcharya, Srijan1 aKim, Kyeong-Man0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2020 July 30, v. 528, no. 3 p.432-439dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.05.1973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01066naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245003900166300001800205520022800223592002800451650001200479650001300491650001900504650000800523650001500531650001100546773009400557856008100651990002300732852000900755655001200764IND60093937220221123012902.0141104e20120724xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009393722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cub.2012.07.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGross, Michael10aLife changes as polar regions thaw  ap.

Our objective was to evaluate combining ability of superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, and catalase activity in cabbage head. Head samples were frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen and placed at -80°C for assay. Less than unity values of σ ² gca/σ ² sca ratio for all three enzymes indicated predominance of non-additive gene action. The parents CMS-GA and Red Cabbage excelled as good general combiners for all antioxidants and indicated the value and need for multiple crossing. The crosses CMS-GAxRed Cabbage, CMS-GAxC-2, 83-2xAC-204, 83-2xEC-490174, 83-2xAC-1021, Pride of AsiaxC-4, and Pride of AsiaxAC-1019 showed significant specific combining ability, which could be exploited through heterosis breeding. The hybrid combinations with high per se performance and favorable SCA estimate and involving at least one of the parents with high GCA estimate could be useful to increase the abundance of favorable alleles for enhancing the antioxidants in cabbage head. 3aBrassica oleracea var. capitata 3acabbage 3aabiotic stress 3astress tolerance 3aantioxidant activity 3asuperoxide dismutase 3aperoxidase 3acatalase 3aenzyme activity 3aplant breeding 3ahybridization 3ahybrids 3aheterosis 3agenetic improvement 3agenotype 3ainbred lines 3agenetic variation 3ageneral combining ability 3aspecific combining ability 3aIndia1 aSharma, S.R.1 aSingh, B.0 tScientia horticulturae.g2009 Sept. 17, v. 122, no. 2 p.195-199dElsevier Sciencex0304-42387nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2009.05.0123Available from publisher's Web site  a20090924b20091002c00000000  aINDd9CTe2009/08/26  aNon-US 7aarticle02794naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245011400129300001600243520163700259650001501896650002001911650001201931650001401943650001101957650001301968650001401981650001201995650001302007650001202020650000902032650001102041650001002052650001902062650002002081650001202101650002002113650001502133651001602148700002202164773008402186852000902270930003302279945001302312946001102325655001202336IND2201628020221119150728.0991116e19990322ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220162802DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChandler, D.G.14aThe use of alkalinity as a conservative tracer in a study of near-surface hydrologic change in tropical karst  ap. 172-182.  aWater shortages commonly increase in frequency following forest clearance on lands overlying karst in the tropics. The mechanism underlying this hydrologic change is likely to depend on the land use which follows forest cover. To determine the flow paths which prevail for a progression of land uses common to the uplands of Leyte, Philippines, samples of interflow were collected during the rainy season and titrated to determine their alkalinities. The ratio of the measured alkalinity to the value predicted by equilibrium calculations for each sample was used as an indication of the contact time of the water with the limestone. The responses of the alkalinity saturation ratio and the runoff depth to increasing rainfall depth were used to substantiate the hypothesis that epikarst infilling and changing soil structure create throttles to percolation and infiltration. The forest site was found to generate interflow primarily as pipe flow, with the infiltration and percolation throttles rarely exceeded. Similarly, infiltration was not limiting for the slash/mulch site; however, the level of soil disturbance was adequate to initiate a throttle at the epikarst which increased the volume of interflow generated. The total percolation was similar for the plowed and slash/mulch sites; however, the interflow was decreased at the plowed site by reduced infiltration at the soil surface. The throttles to surface infiltration and epikarst percolation were even greater at the pasture sites, resulting in high runoff generation. However, comparatively greater infiltration was observed in the pasture having contour-hedgerows. 3aalkalinity 3adisturbed soils 3aforests 3ahighlands 3akarsts 3aland use 3alimestone 3amulches 3apastures 3aplowing 3arain 3arunoff 3aslash 3asoil structure 3asubsurface flow 3atropics 3awater shortages 3awet season 3aPhilippines1 aBisogni, J.J.

III: Effect of shading the trees on potassium chlorate induced FI and resulting hormonal changes in leaves and shoots  ap. 301-311.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aPrevious experiments demonstrated that treatment of longan trees with potassium chlorate (KClO₃) induces “off season floral induction” (FI) even in the absence of the naturally required cool temperature [Manochai, P., Sruamsiri, P., Wiriya-alongkorn, W., Naphrom, D., Hegele, M., Bangerth, F., 2005. Year around off season flower induction in longan (Dimocarpus longan, Lour.) trees by KClO₃ applications: potentials and problems. Sci. Hortic. 104, 379-390]. Potassium chlorate, however, cannot replace the presence of functional mature leaves and sufficient light intensity. Here we examined in more detail the effect of shade (about 10% of natural sunlight) on KClO₃ affected hormone concentrations/transport of leaves and shoot apical buds (SAB) and their interactions with FI. Shade strongly inhibited/prevented KClO₃-stimulated FI and this effect probably depended on light intensity. Vegetative flushes were delayed but not prevented by shading. On the other hand the export of IAA out of the SAB and, the leaf export of iP/iPA- and Z/ZR-type cytokinins were strongly inhibited. With the later hormones shade obviously acted synergistically with KClO₃ to reduce this export. Comparable to the leaf export shade almost entirely prevented the strong increase in iP/iPA- and particularly Z/ZR-cytokinins in the SAB caused by KClO₃ treatment. In spite of this inhibition of iP/iPA export out of leaves by shading, this cannot or not only be the mechanism by which shade prevented KClO₃ induced off season FI because with few exceptions KClO₃ by itself inhibited this iP/iPA export. However, shade inhibited the increase in CKs and here particularly Z/ZR cytokinins in the SAB and simultaneously prevented FI. Possible explanations about these contradictions are discussed. Certainly CKs are not the only hormones involved in the promotion or inhibition of FI of longan and other subtropical trees and the observed early and strong increase in IAA export of the SAB after KClO₃ treatment may also be involved in the FI process. 3alongans 3aDimocarpus longan 3aflowering 3adose response 3ashade tolerance 3aquantitative analysis 3azeatin 3alight intensity 3achlorates 3apotassium 3aindole acetic acid 3aisopentenyladenine 3agibberellins 3achemical constituents of plants 3atemperature 3aleaves 3ashoots 3aGermany 0aisopentenyl-adenosine 0azeatin riboside 0aethylene biosynthesis inhibitors 0aplant hormones1 aPotchanasin, P.1 aNaphrom, D.1 aBangerth, K.F.0 tScientia horticulturae.g2009 Sept. 17, v. 122, no. 2 p.301-311dElsevier Sciencex0304-42387nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2009.06.0063Available from publisher's Web site  a20090924b20091002c00000000  aINDd9CTe2009/08/28  aNon-US 7aarticle01752naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245006600128300001600194520069200210650001400902650001100916650001000927650001000937650002600947650000900973650001400982650002600996650002301022650003601045650002201081650004401103651001301147700001501160700001501175700001401190773007201204852000901276930003301285945001301318946001101331655001201342IND2196540820221119150743.0990120e199807  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219654082DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVajrodaya, S.10aOrgan-specific chemical differences in Glycosmis trichanthera  ap. 897-902.  aThe lipophilic leaf, stem and root extracts of Glycosmis trichanthera are characterized by distinct chemical profiles, containing sulphur-containing amides in the leaves, prenylated acridone alkaloids in the stem bark, and quinoline alkaloids together with a 3,7-diprenylated indole in the root bark.

  1 aJi, J.10aMolecular detection of Muscovy duck parvovirus by loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay  ap. 477-483.  a2019-12-04  aMuscovy duck parvovirus (MDPV) usually causes high morbidity and mortality in 1- to 3-wk-old Muscovy ducklings due to serious infections, which is an imminent threat to the commercial duck industry in China. The objectives of this study were to develop and evaluate a simple, rapid, and inexpensive loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) method for specific detection of MDPV and to compare it with the PCR method in rapidity, sensitivity, and accuracy. The novel LAMP assay used a set of 4 specific primers to recognize 6 distinct genomic sequences of capsid protein (VP3) from MDPV, which could be completed within 50 min at 63°C in a simple water bath. The diagnostic results demonstrated that the LAMP assay detected all 7 preserved MDPV isolates, had no cross-reactivity with other duck pathogens (i.e., goose parvovirus, duck plague virus, H9N2 avian influenza virus, duck hepatitis type virus I, and Muscovy duck reovirus). The LAMP assay was at least 10-fold more sensitive than the routine PCR assay and obtained more sensitivity in 61 clinical samples. Therefore, the newly developed LAMP assay provides a specific and sensitive means for detecting MDPV and can be simply applied both in field conditions and in laboratory operations in a cost-effective manner with primary care facilities. 3acoat proteins 3across reaction 3adisease detection 3aAnseriform dependoparvovirus 1 3amicrobial genetics 3aducks 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aCairina moschata 3arapid methods 3apathogen identification 3amicrobial detection 3anucleotide sequences 3aaccuracy 3adisease diagnosis 2aAnimals 2aDucksxvirology 2aNucleic Acid Amplification Techniquesxmethodsxveterinary. 2aParvovirusxclassificationxisolation & purification. 2aPolymerase Chain Reactionxveterinary 2aPoultry Diseasesxvirology 2aSensitivity and Specificity 0aMuscovy duck parvovirus 0atest specificity 0amolecular sequence data 0atest sensitivity 0aloop-mediated isothermal amplification1 aXie, Q.M.1 aChen, C.Y.1 aBai, S.W.1 aZou, L.S.1 aZuo, K.J.1 aCao, Y.C.1 aXue, C.Y.1 aMa, J.Y.1 aBi, Y.Z.0 tPoultry science.g2010 Mar., v. 89, no. 3 p.477-483dPoultry Science Associationx0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps.2009-005273Available from publisher's Web site  a20100508b20100605c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/04/15  aOther US 7aarticle02536naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002300145245009500168300001800263520114100281650001001422650001001432650001801442650001601460650001101476650002201487650001501509650002601524650002901550650001501579650002101594650001801615650002901633650001501662700002001677700002001697700002801717700003001745700002501775700002201800773010601822852000901928856008501937930003302022946001102055655001202066IND4422424420221119150811.0090626e200906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442242442DNAL7 a10.1365/s10337-009-1032-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBose, Anirbandeep 10aLC-MS Simultaneous Determination of Itopride Hydrochloride and Domperidone in Human Plasma  ap. 1233-1241.  aA rapid, simple, sensitive and specific liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method was developed and validated for simultaneous quantification of itopride hydrochloride and domperidone in human plasma. Both drugs were extracted by liquid-liquid extraction with ethyl acetate and saturated borax solution. The chromatographic separation was performed on a reversed-phase C18 column with a mobile phase of water-methanol (2:98, v/v) containing 0.5% formic acid. The protonated analyte was quantitated in positive ionization by multiple reaction monitoring with a mass spectrometer. The assay exhibited linearity over the concentration range of 3.33-500 ng mL⁻¹ for itopride hydrochloride and 3.33-100 ng mL⁻¹ for domperidone in human plasma. The precursor to product ion transitions of m/z 359.1-72.3 and 426.0-147.2 were used to measure itopride hydrochloride and domperidone respectively. The method was found suitable for the analysis of plasma samples collected during phase 1 pharmacokinetics study of itopride HCl 50 mg and domperidone 20 mg in 12 healthy volunteers after single oral doses of the combination drug. 3aborax 3adrugs 3aethyl acetate 3aformic acid 3ahumans 3ahydrochloric acid 3aionization 3aliquid chromatography 3aliquid-liquid extraction 3amonitoring 3apharmacokinetics 3aspectrometers 3atandem mass spectrometry 3avolunteers1 aBhaumik, Uttam 1 aGhosh, Animesh 1 aChatterjee, Bappaditya 1 aChakrabarty, Uday Sankar 1 aSarkar, Amlan Kanti 1 aPal, Tapan Kumar 0 tChromatographia.g2009 June, v. 69, no. 11-12 p.1233-1241dWiesbaden : Vieweg Verlagx0009-58937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1365/s10337-009-1032-03Available from publisher's Web site  a20090626b20090703c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01998naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001300128245009100141300001600232500004800248520046700296650001100763650001500774650001000789650002300799650003600822650002200858650004400880650003000924650002600954650001000980650005300990650002201043650002801065650005901093650002201152650005601174650001501230651001001245653002201255700001701277700001701294700001401311700001701325773007201342852000901414930003301423945001301456946001101469655001201480IND2196539620221119150819.0990120e199807  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219653962DNAL7 a96647092pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDu, X.M.10aComponents of the ether-insoluble resin glycoside-like fraction from Cuscuta chinensis  ap. 843-850.  aPart XXVI in the series "Resin Glycosides".  aA trisaccharide and four new glycosidic acids, named cuscutic acids A-D, along with known organic acids, acetic acid, propionic acid, (2S)-2-methylbutyric acid, tiglic acid, (2R, 3R)-nilic acid, (11S) convolvulinolic acid and (11S)-jalapinolic acid have been isolated from the alkaline hydrolysate of the ether-insoluble resin glycoside-like fraction of the seeds of Cuscuta chinensis.

  1 aZanetti, E.10aGenetic characterization of local Italian breeds of chickens undergoing in situ conservation  ap. 420-427.  a2019-12-04  aThe objectives of this study were to determine genetic variation and to analyze population structure of 6 Italian local chicken breeds involved in a conservation program. Twenty microsatellite markers were investigated in 337 birds belonging to 6 breeds: Ermellinata di Rovigo, Robusta Maculata, Robusta Lionata, Pépoi, Padovana, and Polverara; a commercial layer cross was used as reference. One hundred twelve alleles were detected in the overall population, with a mean number of 5.6 ± 2.1 alleles per locus. For the local breeds, the observed and expected heterozygosity ranged from a minimum of 0.240 to a maximum of 0.413 and from 0.243 to 0.463 for the Pépoi and Polverara breeds, respectively. Deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was observed in 5 breeds and in the commercial cross. The overall population heterozygote deficiency was 0.427, the average inbreeding coefficient was 0.097, and the heterozygote deficiency due to breed subdivisions was 0.437. Reynolds' distances were used to draw an unrooted neighbor-joining tree, which topology gave information on the genetic origin of these breeds and confirmed their known history. The estimated molecular kinship within a breed ranged from 0.559 to 0.769, evidencing high coancestry. Structure analysis was performed to detect the presence of population substructures. Inferred clusters corresponded to the different breeds, without presence of admixture. The exception was the Polverara breed, for which a more complex genetic structure was found. The results supported the decision of safeguarding these breeds as an important reservoir of genetic diversity and confirmed the usefulness of microsatellite markers to characterize and to monitor genetic variability in local chicken breeds. 3achickens 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aalleles 3aloci 3alandraces 3achicken breeds 3agenetic distance 3aphylogeny 3aheterozygosity 3ainbreeding 3agene frequency 3agenetic variation 3arare breeds 3apopulation structure 3agenetic markers 2aAgriculture 2aAnimals 2aBreeding 2aChickensxgenetics 2aConservation of Natural Resources 2aGenetic Variation 2aMicrosatellite Repeats 2aPhylogeny 3aItaly 0aItaly 0aanimal genetic resources 0amolecular sequence data1 aDe Marchi, M.1 aDalvit, C.1 aCassandro, M.0 tPoultry science.g2010 Mar., v. 89, no. 3 p.420-427dPoultry Science Associationx0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps.2009-003243Available from publisher's Web site  a20100506b20100605c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/04/15  aOther US 7aarticle01192naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245004300125300001600168520018800184650002000372650001400392650001000406650001100416650002300427650003600450650002200486650004400508651001000552700001400562700001200576700001700588700002000605700001500625700001600640773007200656852000900728930003300737945001300770946001100783655001200794IND2196539820221119150807.0990120e199807  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219653982DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorita, H.10aTaxoids from Taxus cuspidata var. nana  ap. 857-862.  aFour new taxoids, taxuspinananes H-K have been isolated from the stems of Taxus cuspidata Sieb. et.

Cienciala, S.W. Running, A. Lindroth, A. Grelle and M.G. Ryan, this journal, v. 213, p. 62-78, 1998.  aIn a recently published paper on simulation and analyses of water and carbon fluxes at the NOPEX central site, a modeling exercise indicated a rather strong sink of carbon for the studied forest stand and year (1994). At the 100-m high tower, the eddy-flux measurements stretch out to the present day. They show that the surrounding forest area is a rather weak source of carbon. This note clarifies the previously published numbers in view of several new findings at the site since the paper preparation (1995) up to the publishing/present date (1998/1999). The key issues that could not be adopted three years ago, were (i) footprint analyses of the eddy-covariance measurements, (ii) correction of eddy-flux data for night-time, and (iii) information on carbon flux from soil. These complementary findings address the previous uncertainties in carbon budget assessment and model parameterization and suggest improvements to model application and better match the measured data. 3aboreal forests 3acarbon 3acarbon sinks 3aeddy covariance 3aforest stands 3ahydrology 3asoil 3auncertainty 0arespiration1 aLindroth, A.0 tJournal of hydrology.g1999 May 10, v. 218, no. 1/2 p.92-94x0022-16947nnas  aDNAL  a20000302b20000309c00000000  aINDdRF1  aNon-US 7aarticle02496naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245010000126300001600226500012500242520137100367650001501738650001101753650000901764650001901773650001501792650001501807650001201822650002001834650001101854650001601865650001501881700002001896700001601916700001601932773008401948852000902032930003302041945001302074946001102087655001202098IND2201697920221119150556.0991122e19990430ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220169792DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrown, V.A.14aThe role of event water, a rapid shallow flow component, and catchment size in summer stormflow  ap. 171-190.  aIn the special issue: Land surface heterogeneity and scaling in hydrology / edited by A. Becker, G. Bloschl and A. Hall.  aSeven nested headwater catchments (8 to 161 ha) were monitored during five summer rain events to evaluate storm runoff components and the effect of catchment size on water sources. Two-component isotopic hydrograph separation showed that event-water contributions near the time of peakflow ranged from 49% to 62% in the 7 catchments during the highest intensity event. The proportion of event water in stormflow was greater than could be accounted for by direct precipitation onto saturated areas. DOC concentrations in stormflow were strongly correlated with stream 18O composition. Bivariate mixing diagrams indicated that the large event water contributions were likely derived from flow through the soil O-horizon. Results from two-tracer, three-component hydrograph separations showed that the throughfall and O-horizon soil-water components together could account for the estimated contributions of event water to stormflow. End-member mixing analysis confirmed these results. Estimated event-water contributions were inversely related to catchment size, but the relation was significant for only the event with greatest rainfall intensity. Our results suggest that perched, shallow subsurface flow provides a substantial contribution to summer stormflow in these small catchments, but the relative contribution of this component decreases with catchment size. 3ahydrograph 3amixing 3arain 3arain intensity 3asoil water 3astormwater 3astreams 3asubsurface flow 3asummer 3athroughfall 3awatersheds1 aMcDonnell, J.J.1 aBurns, D.A.1 aKendall, C.0 tJournal of hydrology.g1999 Apr. 30, v. 217, no. 3/4 p.171-190x0022-16947nnas  aDNAL  a20000104b20000110c00000000  aINDdRF1  aNon-US 7aarticle01608naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245006800128300001600196520058500212650003100797650001100828650001800839650002100857650002300878650003600901650002200937650004400959650002101003651001001024700002601034700001701060700001901077773007201096852000901168930003301177945001301210946001101223655001201234IND2196538620221119150421.0990120e199807  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219653862DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarrero, A.F.10aSesquiterpenes from Santolina chamaecyparissus subsp. squarrosa  ap. 807-813.  aFour new sesquiterpenes (E)-6 beta-acetoxy-7 alpha H-germacra-4,10(14)-diene-1 alpha,2 beta-diol (1), (4E,9Z)-6 beta-acetoxy-7 alpha H-germacra-4,9-diene-1 alpha, 2 beta-diol (2), (E)-6 beta-acetoxy-7 alpha H-germacra-1(10),4-diene-2 beta-ol (3) and 6 beta-acetoxy-5 beta H, 7 alpha H, 10 beta Me-eudesm-4(15)-ene-1 alpha, 2 beta-dol (4), were identified in the ether extract from the aerial parts of Santolina chamaecyparissus subsp. squarrosa.

Leaves, of the same type of those used in the calli induction, G-calli and R-calli were submitted to hydrodistillation and the respective hydrodistillates were analysed by GC and GC-mass spectrometry. The hydrodistillate from leaves consisted of ca 50% monoterpenoids (35.2% oxygenated monoterpenes and 14.3% monoterpene hydrocarbons) and ca 40% of sesquiterpenoids (2.5% oxygenated sesquiterpenes and 37.4% sesquiterpene hydrocarbons). Linalool (16.4%) and (E)-beta-ocimene (6.6%) were the major oxygenated monoterpene and monoterpene hydrocarbon, respectively. Globulol (0.94%) and delta-elemene (12.85%) were the major oxygenated sesquiterpene and sesquiterpene hydrocarbon, respectively. n-Alkanes, namely pentacosane (0.97%), heptacosane (0.9%) and nonacosane (1.0%), were also present. Hydrodistillates from G- and R-calli did not contain either mono- or sesquiterpenoids; n-alkanes were the main compounds found. The alkane concentration in R-calli was more than twice that of G-calli. Naphthalene (0.5 micrograms g-1 dry wt) and eicosane, (0.9 micrograms g-1 dry wt) produced by R-calli were absent in G-calli. Squalene concentration in G-calli was 6.7 fold greater than that found in R-calli. 3asesquiterpenoids 3acallus 3aquantitative analysis 3aessential oils 3aocimene 3aalkanes 3aroot primordia 3a2,4-D 3aspectral analysis 3achemical constituents of plants 3anaphthalene 3asqualene 3aOriganum vulgare 3alinalool 3aleaves 0adelta-elemente 0amonoterpenoids 0ahydrocarbons 0aglobulol1 aFernandes-Ferreira, M.0 tPhytochemistry.g1998 July, v. 48, no. 5 p.795-799x0031-94227nnas  aDNAL  a19990301b19990308c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle01573naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245010100125300001800226520041600244650001300660650001200673650000900685650002100694650002300715650002500738650003600763650004400799650002200843650002100865700001400886700001500900700001400915700001300929700001400942700001400956700001500970700001400985773007400999852000901073930003301082945001301115946001101128655001201139IND2196814120221119150427.0990203e199808  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219681412DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJung, K.Y.10a5 alpha,7 alpha(H)-6,8-cycloeudesma-1 beta,4 beta-diol from the flower buds of Magnolia fargesii  ap. 1383-1386.  aFrom the Chinese crude drug shin-i, the flower buds of Magnolia fargesii, a new cycloeudesmane-type sesquiterpene, 5 alpha, 7 alpha(H)-6,8-cycloeudesma-1 beta, 4 beta-diol, was isolated.

Becker, G. Bloschl and A. Hall.  a2019-12-05  aThis article describes the development, application and validation of a macro-scale hydrological model, designed to simulate streamfiow from climatic inputs over a large geographic domain. The model is a daily water balance model, which assumes that the soil moisture storage capacity varies statistically across the catchment: all other catchment properties, and climatic inputs, are assumed constant across the catchment. Model parameters are derived, directly or indirectly, from digital spatial data bases. The model is currently implemented at a spatial resolution of 0.5 x 0.50 degrees (approximately 2000 km2), because that is the resolution of the currently available climatic input data. In fact, the article emphasises how the form, parameterisation and quality of simulated output are strongly determined by the quality and characteristics of the data used both to define model parameters and to run the model. The article illustrates the model tuning process--which includes assessment of the input data--using the example of an application in Europe. 3asimulation models 3astream flow 3awatersheds 3aspatial data 3asoil water 3adatabases 3ahydrologic models 3aEurope 0awater balance0 tJournal of hydrology.g1999 Apr. 30, v. 217, no. 3/4 p.314-335x0022-16947nnas  aDNAL  a20000104b20000110c00000000  aINDdRF1  aNon-US 7aarticle02657naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245008800168300001600256520154600272650003001818650002101848650002201869650002501891650002301916651001101939700002701950700001701977700002201994700002102016700002002037773020302057856005002260852000902310655001202319IND60634523520221119150827.0190325e200408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063452352DNAL7 a10.1623/hysj.49.4.717.544212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOnibon, Hubert10aRegional frequency analysis of annual maximum daily precipitation in Quebec, Canada  ap. 717-735.  aA complete regional analysis of daily precipitations is carried out in the southern half of the province of Quebec, Canada. The first step of the regional estimation procedure consists of delineating the homogeneous regions within the area of study and testing for homogeneity within each region. The delineation of homogeneous regions is based on using L-moment ratios. A simulation-based testing of statistical homogeneity allows one to verify the inter-site variability. The second step of the procedure deals with the identification of the regional distribution and the estimation of its parameters. The General Extreme Value (GEV) distribution was identified as an appropriate parent distribution. This distribution has already been recommended by several previous research studies for regional frequency analysis of precipitation extremes. The parameters of the GEV distribution are estimated based on the computation of the regional L-CV, L-CS  and the mean of annual maximal daily precipitations. The third step consists of the estimation of precipitation quantiles corresponding to various return periods. The final procedure allows for the estimation of these quantiles at sites where no precipitation information is available. The use of a jack-knife resampling procedure with data from the province of Quebec allows one to demonstrate the robustness and efficiency of the regional estimation procedure. Values of the root mean square error were below 10% for a return period of 20 years, and 20% for a return period of 100 years. 3aatmospheric precipitation 3amodel validation 3asimulation models 3astatistical analysis 3astatistical models 3aQuebec1 aOuarda, Taha B.

These have been characterised by the determination of solubility, free amino group, tryptophan content and chromatographic as well as electrophoretic behaviour. In the range between 2.5 and 125 mg benzyl-ITC/g protein, all properties of the reaction products correlate with the concentration of benzyl-ITC. However, at 250 mg benzyl-ITC/g myoglobin, a rather unexpected low degree of derivatization, as well as atypical chromatographic and electrophoretic behaviour, is observed. The proposed explanation was that conformational changes in the presence of a high concentration of hydrophobic benzyl-ITC made fewer amino groups accessible to the reagent. To test this hypothesis we have run the reaction under denaturing conditions. The results showed that the reaction of myoglobin with high concentrations of benzyl-ITC in the presence of 8 M urea led to a higher degree of derivatization than in the presence of water only. In addition, the Mr distribution of the reaction products was determined by MALDI-TOF-mass spectrometry and the overall degree of derivatization calculated from the spectra. 3abenzyl isothiocyanate 3amyoglobin 3aglucosinolates 3asolubility 3atryptophan 3achromatography 3aelectrophoresis 3achemical reactions 3aurea 3awater 3apH 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aIsothiocyanatesxchemistry 2aKinetics 2aMyoglobinxchemistry 2aProtein Denaturation 2aSolubility 2aSpectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization 2aThioglucosidesxchemistry 2aUrea 0aderivatives1 aKroll, J.1 aHaebel, S.1 aPeter, M.G.0 tPhytochemistry.g1998 Aug., v. 48, no. 8 p.1305-1311x0031-94227nnas  aDNAL  a19990301b19990308c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02242naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001400144245011700158300001600275520102800291650004301319650001301362650002001375650001401395650002001409650002301429650002301452650002801475650003501503650001801538653004401556700001701600700002201617700001401639700001701653773007201670852000901742930003301751945002501784946001101809655001201820IND4377748220221119150557.0060209e200601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437774822DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The fastest MLP training algorithm, that is the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, is used for optimization of the network weights for data from two stations on the Tongue River in Montana, USA. The first part of the study deals with prediction and estimation of upstream and down-stream station sediment data, separately, and the second part focuses on the estimation of downstream suspended sediment data by using data from both stations. In each case, the MLP test results are compared to those of generalized regression neural networks (GRNN), radial basis function (RBF) and multi-linear regression (MLR) for the best-input combinations. Based on the comparisons, it was found that the MLP generally gives better suspended sediment concentration estimates than the other neural network techniques and the conventional statistical method (MLR). However, for the estimation of maximum sediment peak, the RBF was mostly found to be better than the MLP and the other techniques. The results also indicate that the RBF and GRNN may provide better performance than the MLP in the estimation of the total sediment load. 3aalgorithms 3aneural networks 3apollution load 3aprediction 3arivers 3asediment yield 3asediments 3asuspended sediment 3aMontana0 tHydrological sciences journal.g2004, v. 49, no. 6 p.1025-1040dPublished for the International Association of Hydrological Sciences by Blackwell Scientific PublicationswJournal:2013x0262-66677nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1623/hysj.49.6.1025.55720  aDNAL 7aarticle03159naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148072000900157072000900166072000900175100002100184245012600205300001600331500002400347500001500371520160100386650002201987650002402009650001702033650002402050650002202074650001802096650001802114650001402132650001202146650002202158650002002180650001902200650002402219653001602243700002102259700002402280700002102304700002902325773010902354852000902463856008802472930003302560945002502593946001102618655001202629IND4423291420221119150457.0090718e20090820xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442329142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2009.04.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL300 0aL002 0aL001 0aK0011 aSobek, Stephanie10aCanopy vs. understory: Does tree diversity affect bee and wasp communities and their natural enemies across forest strata  ap. 609-615.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aBees and wasps provide important ecosystem services such as pollination and biocontrol in crop-dominated landscapes, but surprisingly little information is available on hymenopteran communities in temperate forest ecosystems. Species richness and abundance of bees and wasps can be hypothesised to increase with plant diversity, structural complexity, and availability of food and nesting resources. By experimentally exposing standardised nesting sites, we examined abundance and species richness of cavity-nesting bees (pollinators), wasps (predators) and their associated parasitoids across a tree diversity gradient in a temperate deciduous forest habitat. In addition, spatial distribution of individuals and species across forest strata (canopy vs. understory) was tested. Abundance and species richness was high for predatory wasps, but generally low for pollinators. Species-rich forest stands supported increased abundance, but not species richness, of pollinators and predatory wasps, and also increased abundance and species richness of natural enemies. In addition, the forests showed a distinct spatial stratification in that abundance of bees, wasps and parasitoids as well as parasitism rates were higher in the canopy than understory. We conclude that particularly the canopy in temperate forest stands can serve as an important habitat for predatory wasp species and natural enemies, but not bee pollinators. Enhanced tree diversity was related to increased hymenopteran abundance, which is likely to be linked to an increase in nesting and food resources in mixed forest stands. 3adeciduous forests 3ahabitat preferences 3aforest trees 3acommunity structure 3apredatory insects 3aforest canopy 3atree cavities 3adead wood 3aApoidea 3aspecies diversity 3anatural enemies 3ainsect ecology 3apollinating insects 0aHymenoptera1 aTscharntke, Teja1 aScherber, Christoph1 aSchiele, Susanne1 aSteffan-Dewenter, Ingolf0 tForest ecology and management.g2009 Aug. 20, v. 258, no. 5 p.609-615dElsevier Sciencex0378-11277nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2009.04.0263Available from publisher's Web site  a20090731b20090801c00000000  aINDdLYNe2009/07/29  aNon-US 7aarticle01353naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001200110245005200122300001800174520041400192650001600606650001700622650001100639650002300650650003600673650004400709650002200753651001300775653001600788700001600804700001400820700001700834773007400851852000900925930003300934945001300967946001100980655001200991IND2196786620221119150447.0990202e199808  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219678662DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAli, Z.10aBenzoic acid derivatives from Stocksia brahuica  ap. 1271-1273.  aTwo new benzoic acid derivatives, ethyl 3,5-dihydroxy-4-methoxybenzoate and 2-hydroxy-3-methylbenzoic acid, have been isolated from the aerial parts of Stocksia brahuica.

The conduit transforms the input signal to an output signal, and the degree of transformation provides information on the nature of the flow system. The input for the analysis is net precipitation and the flow hydrograph at the cave entrance, while the output series is the flow hydrograph at the resurgence. Cross-correlation and cross-spectrum analysis are used to investigate the stationarity and linearity of the input–output transformation of the system, resulting in hydrodynamic properties such as system memory, response time, and mean delay between input and output. It is shown that during high flow periods, the flow in the conduit is pressurized. Consequently, the linear input–output assumption holds only for low flows. To highlight the hydrodynamics of the cavern conduit for the high flow periods, wavelet spectrum and wavelet cross-spectrum analyses are applied. 3acaves 3ahydrodynamics 3ahydrograph 3atime series analysis 3atransient flow 3awavelet 3aVietnam1 aSmedt, Florimond de,1 aBatelaan, Okke1 aDassargues, Alain0 tHydrological sciences journal.g2004, v. 49, no. 5 p.879-900dPublished for the International Association of Hydrological Sciences by Blackwell Scientific PublicationswJournal:2013x0262-66677nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1623/hysj.49.5.879.55140  aDNAL 7aarticle03868naa a2200733 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142072001700160072001700177100001600194245023900210300001600449500001500465520157400480650002102054650003002075650001802105650001102123650001402134650002202148650001002170650001002180650001902190650001202209650002202221650001102243650002302254650002002277650002602297650004702323650001202370650002202382650006202404650002102466650002602487650001702513650003902530650001202569650002502581650002802606650000902634650004002643650001302683653001202696653002002708653002202728653002302750700001602773700002102789700001602810700001702826700001602843773010202859852000902961856008102970930003303051945002503084946001303109655001203122IND4431401920221119150827.0100115e201002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443140192DNAL7 a200752802pmid7 a10.3382/ps.2009-003362doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

A total of 240 seven-day-old male Cobb broilers were allocated to 1 of 6 treatments, with 8 replicate pens per treatment and 5 birds per pen. The experiment consisted of a 3 x 2 factorial arrangement of the treatments with 3 concentrations of inulin (0, 10, or 20 g/kg of diet) and 2 concentrations of enzyme complex (0 or 100 mg/kg of diet). At the end of the experiment, 8 birds per treatment (one from each pen) were randomly chosen and slaughtered. Birds fed inulin-containing diets exhibited significantly (P = 0.043) improved final BW gain. Dietary inulin had a positive and significant (P < 0.002 to 0.009) effect on bifidobacteria and lactobacilli counts in both ileal and cecal contents and, to an extent, also altered the fermentation patterns in the ceca, increasing the concentration of n-butyric and D-lactic acids and the n-butyric acid:acetic acid ratio. Inulin inclusion had no effect on villus height and crypt depth or microvillus length, width, and density in the jejunum. Enzyme supplementation of the control diet and inulin-containing diets had no effect on many of the variables studied and only resulted in a decrease in crypt depth and an increase in villus height:crypt depth ratio in the jejunum. 3abroiler chickens 3aintestinal microorganisms 3aanimal growth 3abarley 3axylanases 3aanimal morphology 3acecum 3awheat 3abeta-glucanase 3ajejunum 3aintestinal mucosa 3ainulin 3aanimal performance 3abroiler feeding 2aAnimal Feedxanalysis 2aAnimal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aAnimals 2aCecumxphysiology 2aChickensxgrowth & developmentxmicrobiologyxphysiology. 2aDietxveterinary 2aEnzymesxpharmacology 2aFermentation 2aGlycoside Hydrolasesxpharmacology 2aHordeum 2aInulinxpharmacology 2aJejunumxultrastructure 2aMale 2aMultienzyme Complexesxpharmacology 2aTriticum 0aenzymes 0ahistomorphology 0agrain-based diets 0acecal fermentation1 aOrtiz, L.T.1 aRodríguez, M.L.1 aAlzueta, C.1 aTreviño, J.1 aVelasco, S.0 tPoultry science.g2010 Feb., v. 89, no. 2 p.276-286dPoultry Science Associationx0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps.2009-003363Available from publisher's Web site  a20100318b20100403c00000000  aINDd3CTe2010/02/18  aOther US 7aarticle02971naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002400110245010600134300001600240500001500256520178900271650001002060650002302070650001602093650002502109650001502134650001902149650002202168650002002190650002002210650002102230650001302251650004302264653002702307653001702334653001102351700001702362700001902379773007302398852000902471930003302480945001302513946001102526655001202537IND2196924520221119150038.0990211e199809  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219692452DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSelânikli A.

This is not due to end-product activation of an endo-1,4-beta-glucanase or XGase, for the following reasons: non-specific endo-1,4-beta-glucanase (carboxymethylcellulase) activities in developing tomato fruit were recovered from buffer and detergent-extracts but were barely detectable in subsequent extracts with 1 M NaCl, where XG-depolymerizing activity predominated. Salt-soluble extracts alone were totally unable to degrade high M(r) XG from tamarind seed in the absence of fragments of low M(r) XG or oligosaccharide subunits. The degradation catalysed by tomato salt extract plus tamarind XG and XG oligosaccharides failed to proceed to completion or generate low M(r) end products, as happens in the presence of cellulase. The reactions progressed with no detectable net increase in total reducing power of the reaction mixtures, but were accompanied by condensation of XG cleavage fragments with XG [14C]oligosaccharide, as expected from XG endotransglycosylase (XET) activity. The activity leading to the depolymerization of XG, as assayed viscometrically in the presence of XG oligosaccharide, co-chromatographed in various media in the same fractions as XET activity, as assayed radiometrically. It is concluded that XET activity in salt extracts of young green tomato is sufficient by itself to explain the observed capacity of extracts to depolymerize tamarind XG. In vivo, 1,4-beta-glucanase or XGase activity would also be required to generate the low M(r) XG acceptors needed for transglycosylase to catalyse a net depolymerization of XG. 3aseeds 3acatalytic activity 3axyloglucans 3aglycosyltransferases 3acellulases 3aplant extracts 3aTamarindus indica 3asodium chloride 3aenzyme activity 3aoligosaccharides 3afruiting 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 0aO-glycoside hydrolases 0aglycosidases 0afruits1 aDesveaux, D.1 aMaclachlan, G.0 tPhytochemistry.g1998 Sept., v. 49, no. 2 p.365-376x0031-94227nnas  aDNAL  a19990405b19990413c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02508naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001700128245010200145300001600247520094600263650002101209650002901230650001901259650001001278650002701288650002301315650002601338650002101364650001901385650001301404650003601417650002201453650002701475650003701502650002201539650004101561650004701602650004101649651001801690651001101708651002501719653002301744700001601767700001801783700001201801700001401813773007301827852000901900930003301909945001301942946001101955655001201966IND2196924320221119150525.0990211e199809  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219692432DNAL7 a97475362pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCalvey, E.M.10aAllium chemistry: identification of organosulfur compounds in ramp (Allium tricoccum) homogenates  ap. 359-364.  aSupercritical fluid (SF) extracts of homogenized ramp (Allium tricoccum Ait.) were separated and characterized with liquid chromatography coupled with atmospheric pressure chemical ionization mass spectrometric identification. The profiles of SF extracts of aqueous homogenates of ramp bulbs from three different seasons and growing regions revealed that the thiosulfinates were major components. In addition, some of the cepaenes (alpha-sulfinylidisulfides) found in extracts of onion juice, as well as allyl containing cepaenes (2-propenyl 1-(2-propenylsulfinyl)propyl disulfide), are present in the ramp extracts. The amount of allicin in ramp bulb homogenates ranged from approximately 10% to 50% of that found in extracts of aqueous garlic homogenates. The greater amount of the methyl 1-propenyl thiosulfinates in the ramp extracts relative to that found in the garlic extracts correlates with the flavor characteristics of ramp bulbs. 3aAllium tricoccum 3aorganic sulfur compounds 3aplant extracts 3abulbs 3ageographical variation 3atemporal variation 3aquantitative analysis 3aflavor compounds 3aAllium sativum 3asulfides 3achemical constituents of plants 2aAlliumxchemistry 2aChromatography, Liquid 2aDisulfidesxanalysisxchemistry. 2aMass Spectrometry 2aPlant Extractsxanalysisxchemistry. 2aSulfhydryl Compoundsxanalysisxchemistry. 2aSulfinic Acidsxanalysisxchemistry. 3aWest Virginia 3aQuebec 3aDistrict of Columbia 0asulfides (organic)1 aWhite, K.D.1 aMatusik, J.E.1 aSha, D.1 aBlock, E.0 tPhytochemistry.g1998 Sept., v. 49, no. 2 p.359-364x0031-94227nnas  aDNAL  a19990405b19990413c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle03970naa a2200781 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151100001600169245004500185300001600230500001500246520194200261650000902203650001602212650001102228650000802239650001102247650001002258650001002268650001802278650001702296650001402313650002102327650000902348650002202357650001002379650001202389650003402401650003502435650001402470650001902484650000902503650001102512650001102523650001802534650002002552650002502572650003602597650000902633650001502642650001502657650002402672650001302696650001202709651001102721651001102732653001402743653001002757653003602767700001902803700001502822700001502837700001602852700001502868700001402883700001902897773010202916852000903018856009003027930003303117945001303150946001303163655001203176IND2322672820221119150713.0010822e200004  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232267282DNAL7 a107639062pmid7 a10.1080/07315724.2000.107189232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWhite, L.R.10aBrain aging and midlife tofu consumption  ap. 242-255.  a2019-12-04  aObjective: To examine associations of midlife tofu consumption with brain function and structural changes in late life. Methods: The design utilized surviving participants of a longitudinal study established in 1965 for research on heart disease, stroke, and cancer. Information on consumption of selected foods was available from standardized interviews conducted 1965-1967 and 1971-1974. A 4-level composite intake index defined "low-low" consumption as fewer than two servings of tofu per week in 1965 and no tofu in the prior week in 1971. Men who reported two or more servings per week at both interviews were defined as "high-high" consumers. Intermediate or less consistent "low" and "high" consumption levels were also defined. Cognitive functioning was tested at the 1991-1993 examination, when participants were aged 71 to 93 years (n = 3734). Brain atrophy was assessed using neuroimage (n = 574) and autopsy (n = 290) information. Cognitive function data were also analyzed for wives of a sample of study participants (n = 502) who had been living with the participants at the time of their dietary interviews. Results: Poor cognitive test performance, enlargement of ventricles and low brain weight were each significantly and independently associated with higher midlife tofu consumption. A similar association of midlife tofu intake with poor late life cognitive test scores was also observed among wives of cohort members, using the husband's answers to food frequency questions as proxy for the wife's consumption. Statistically significant associations were consistently demonstrated in linear and logistic multivariate regression models. Odds ratios comparing endpoints among "high-high" with "low-low" consumers were mostly in the range of 1.6 to 2.0. Conclusions: In this population, higher midlife tofu consumption was independently associated with indicators of cognitive impairment and brain atrophy in late life. 3atofu 3afood intake 3aweight 3amen 3aAsians 3awomen 3abrain 3aacculturation 3afood choices 3acognition 3afood consumption 2aAged 2aAged, 80 and over 2aAging 2aAtrophy 2aBrainxpathologyxphysiology. 2aCerebral Ventriclesxpathology 2aCognition 2aCohort Studies 2aDiet 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aLinear Models 2aLogistic Models 2aLongitudinal Studies 2aMagnetic Resonance Spectroscopy 2aMale 2aOdds Ratio 2aOrgan Size 2aProspective Studies 2aSoybeans 2aSpouses 3aHawaii 0aHawaii 0astructure 0aaging 0anationalities and ethnic groups1 aPetrovitch, H.1 aRoss, G.W.1 aMasaki, K.1 aHardman, J.1 aNelson, J.1 aDavis, D.1 aMarkesbery, W.0 tJournal of the American College of Nutrition.g2000 Apr., v. 19, no. 2 p.242-255x0731-57247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07315724.2000.107189233Available from publisher's Web site  a20011101b20011108c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle03087naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001500129245009300144300001800237520197200255650001902227650001802246650001602264650002102280650001502301650001802316650001902334650002002353650001102373650001802384650001302402653001402415653003302429653003102462700001802493773009802511852000902609930003302618945001302651946001302664655001202677IND2042239120221119150641.0940926e199407  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204223912DNAL7 a163493312pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCook, G.M.10aDual mechanisms of tricarboxylate transport and catabolism by Acidaminococcus fermentans  ap. 2538-2544.  aAcidaminococcus fermentans utilized citrate or the citrate analog aconitate as an energy source for growth, and these tricarboxylates were used simultaneously. Citrate utilization and uptake showed biphasic kinetics. High-affinity citrate uptake had a Kt of 40 micromolar, but the Vmax was only 25 nmol/mg of protein per min. Low-affinity citrate utilization had a 10-fold higher Vmax, but the Ks was greater than 1.0 mM. Aconitate was a competitive inhibitor (Ki = 34 micromolar) of high-affinity citrate uptake, but low-affinity aconitate utilization had a 10-fold-lower requirement for sodium than did low-affinity citrate utilization. On the basis of this large difference in sodium requirements, it appeared that A. fermentans probably has two systems of tricarboxylate uptake: (i) a citrate/aconitate carrier with a low affinity for sodium and (ii) an aconitate carrier with a high affinity for sodium. Citrate was catabolized by a pathway involving a biotin-requiring, avidin-sensitive, sodium-dependent, membrane-bound oxaloacetate decarboxylase. The cells also had aconitase, but this enzyme was unable to convert citrate to isocitrate. Since cell-free extracts converted either aconitate or glutamate to 2-oxoglutarate, it appeared that aconitate was being catabolized by the glutaconyl-CoA decarboxylase pathway. Exponentially growing cultures on citrate or citrate plus aconitate were inhibited by the sodium/proton antiporter, monensin. Because monensin had no effect on cultures growing with aconitate alone, it appeared that citrate metabolism was acting as an inducer of monensin sensitivity. A. fermentans cells always had a low proton motive force (< 50 mV), and cells treated with the protonophore TCS (3.3',4',5-tetrachlorosalicylanide) grew even though the proton motive force was less than 20 mV. On the basis of these results, it appeared that A. fermentans was depending almost exclusively on a sodium motive force for its membrane energetics. 3arumen bacteria 3aaconitic acid 3acitric acid 3aactive transport 3ametabolism 3aion transport 3acarboxy-lyases 3aenzyme activity 3asodium 3ahydrogen ions 3amonensin 0agradients 0aglutaconyl-coa decarboxylase 0aoxaloacetate decarboxylase1 aRussell, J.B.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g1994 July, v. 60, no. 7 p.2538-2544x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL  a19941004b19941021c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03320naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150072000900168072000900177072000900186072000900195100003900204245013400243300001600377500002400393520140600417650002201823650002301845650001101868650001901879650001901898650001701917650002501934650001301959650001801972650002401990650002902014650002302043650002402066650001602090650002302106650002302129650004402152650002302196650002002219650001502239650001702254650001002271653002002281700003002301700002102331700002002352700002002372700002302392773008802415852000902503856008902512930003302601945002502634946001102659655001202670IND4423289620221119150708.0090718e200910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442328962DNAL7 a204167392pmid7 a10.1016/j.meatsci.2009.05.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aS200 0aQ402 0aQ122 0aQ5021 aCiriano, Mikel García-Iñiguez de10aUse of natural antioxidants from lyophilized water extracts of Borago officinalis in dry fermented sausages enriched in ω-3 PUFA  ap. 271-277.  aIncludes references  aAn evaluation of the capacity of a lyophilized water extract of borage leaves to delay the lipid oxidation process in dry fermented sausages enriched with ω-3 PUFAs has been performed. Lyophilized extract (340ppm) showed an antioxidant capacity equivalent to 200ppm of a butylhydroxyanisol (BHA) and butylhydroxytoluene (BHT) mixture. Two batches of dry fermented sausages enriched in ω-3 PUFA were developed. One of them was supplemented with a synthetic antioxidants mixture (200ppm of BHA+BHT) and the other one with natural antioxidants (340ppm of lyophilized water extract of borage leaves). Furthermore, a traditional formulation of this type of dry fermented sausage (Control), was also manufactured. The natural extract gave rise to lower amount of volatile compounds (including hexanal), than the mixture of synthetic antioxidants (2202 and 2713ng dodecane/g dry matter, respectively). TBARS and Cholesterol Oxidation Products (COPs) did not show significant differences between products with different antioxidants. The sensorial analysis showed that lyophilized water extracts of borage leaves did not affect the sensorial properties of the products. From the economical and safety standpoints, the use of a by-product (borage leaves) and water as extracting solvent are valuable alternatives for obtaining natural antioxidants to be added to dry fermented sausages enriched in ω-3 PUFA. 3anatural additives 3aBorago officinalis 3aleaves 3aplant extracts 3aessential oils 3aantioxidants 3aantioxidant activity 3asausages 3afreeze drying 3aomega-3 fatty acids 3abutylated hydroxyanisole 3abatch fermentation 3aoxidative stability 3alinseed oil 3alipid peroxidation 3avolatile compounds 3athiobarbituric acid-reactive substances 3asensory evaluation 3afermented foods 3adried meat 3ameat quality 3acolor 0alipid oxidation1 aGarcía-Herreros, Cecilia1 aLarequi, Eduardo1 aValencia, Idoia1 aAnsorena, Diana1 aAstiasarán, Iciar0 tMeat science.g2009 Oct., v. 83, no. 2 p.271-277dElsevier Sciencex0309-17407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meatsci.2009.05.0093Available from publisher's Web site  a20090818b20091002c00000000  aINDdPNNe2009/08/18  aNon-US 7aarticle02281naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146072001700163072001700180100001600197245008800213300001800301520057100319650001500890650001900905650002000924650001400944650002300958650002200981650002001003650002901023650002601052650006601078650007801144650002701222650002401249650007301273650002601346650002701372650002601399651001101425653002101436653001501457700001701472700001301489700001501502700001601517700001701533773007501550852000901625930003301634945002501667946001101692655001201703IND4376502120221119150716.0051205e200511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437650212DNAL7 a162262842pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

However MSX had no effect on glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH; EC 1.4.1.2) activity or subunit composition in the roots of wheat or pea. In the leaves of pea, MSX stimulated a 4.5 fold increase in NADH-dependent glutamate dehydrogenase activity, that correlated with the synthesis of a second enzyme subunit and a dramatic alteration in the GDH isoenzyme pattern following native PAGE. Although MSX also caused a 2.4 fold increase in GDH activity in wheat leaves, this increase was not accompanied by a change in subunit composition or isoenzyme pattern. It is concluded that MSX does not inhibit GDH in the leaves or roots of wheat and pea seedlings, but it may cause the onset of premature senescence, which results in an increase in GDH activity in the leaves, as has been shown previously. 3aglutamate dehydrogenase 3aseedlings 3aamino acid derivatives 3adosage 3aglutamate-ammonia ligase 3aenzyme inhibitors 3aTriticum aestivum 3amethionine 3achemical constituents of plants 3aPisum sativum 3aenzyme activity 3aisozymes 3aroots 3aleaves 0asenescence1 aPahlich, E.1 aLea, P.J.0 tPhytochemistry.g1998 Sept., v. 49, no. 2 p.347-354x0031-94227nnas  aDNAL  a19990405b19990413c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle01115naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245005100125300001800176520024000194650001400434650001400448650001200462650002300474650003600497650004400533650002200577651001000599700001500609700001300624773007400637852000900711930003300720945001300753946001100766655001200777IND2196818320221119150759.0990203e199808  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219681832DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTanaka, H.10aErythrinan alkaloid from Erythrina x bidwillii  ap. 1461-1463.  aA new alkaloid, erythbidin B, was isolated from flowers of Erythrina x bidwillii, together with the three known alkaloids, erythraline, erysodine and erythrinine.

The objective of this work is to evaluate the evolution of two renewable organic substrates, wood fibre (WF) and coconut fibre (CF) throughout one cultivation cycle. Two trials were set up, one with and a second one without crop. Volume, pH and EC of the input solution and the drainage solution were measured in both trials. In the trial without crop the content of NO₃ ⁻, Cl⁻, (SO₄)²⁻,Ca²⁺, Mg²⁺, Na⁺, P and K⁺ was also determined. Physico-chemical characterization of the substrates was determined at the beginning and at the end of the trials. In order to know the loss of organic matter (OM), the dry matter content of the substrates was determined at the beginning and at the end of both trials. It has been observed that in both substrates retention of elements like NO₃ ⁻, Ca²⁺, P and Mg²⁺ occurs. In the study of the physico-chemical properties, it has been observed that the air capacity decreases considerably in both substrates in the trial with crop, especially in the CF, as well as a greater reduction of the C/N rate and percentage of OM. The data of organic matter loosed shows that in the trial with crop both substrates have lost more OM and this loss is slightly superior in CF. Therefore it is important to consider the possible retention of nutrients in the organic substrates to optimise cultivation management, as well as their degradability, which influences on the physico-chemical properties throughout the crop cycle. 3anutrient content 3aorganic matter 3atomatoes 3aplant residues 3asulfates 3ahydroponics 3asodium 3acoir 3aquantitative analysis 3acalcium 3agreenhouse production 3apotassium 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 3achlorides 3amagnesium 3aphysicochemical properties 3awater flow 3acarbon nitrogen ratio 3asoilless media 3awood fibers 3anitrates 0acrop production1 aIrigoyen, N.1 aMuro, J.0 tScientia horticulturae.g2009 Sept. 17, v. 122, no. 2 p.269-274dElsevier Sciencex0304-42387nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2009.05.0063Available from publisher's Web site  a20090924b20091002c00000000  aINDd9CTe2009/08/28  aNon-US 7aarticle02040naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001200110245008300122300001400205520121600219650001401435650001101449650000901460650001201469650001601481650001501497653002401512700001401536700001601550773008201566852000901648930003301657945001301690946001101703655001201714IND2202976620221119150631.0000311e19990726ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220297662DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDou, C.10aFuzzy rule-based approach to describe solute transport in the unsaturated zone  ap. 74-85.  aA fuzzy rule-based model is developed for simulation of solute transport processes in the vadose zone. Underlying physical processes of solute transport described by appropriate differential equations are captured in fuzzy rules. These rules are derived from a training set obtained from different test runs of the SWMS 2D model which simulates water flow and solute transport in two-dimensional variably saturated media. Fuzzy rules operate between two adjacent cells at each time step. Solute concentration of the upper cell, and solute concentration difference between two adjacent cells are used as premises. For a given time step, the solute flux between the two cells is taken as the response, which is combined with the conservation of mass to update the new solute concentration for the new time step. The methodology is applied to solve the breakthrough curve of bromide movement in a soil column. It is also generalized to the same problem under different soil and boundary conditions. In both cases, the fuzzy solution appears to be similar to the measured bromide concentration as well as the SWMS 2D model results. The methodology provides a more efficient alternative to existing modeling methods. 3aequations 3amodels 3asoil 3asolutes 3avadose zone 3awater flow 0atransport processes1 aWoldt, W.1 aBogardi, I.0 tJournal of hydrology.g1999 July 26, v. 220, no. 1/2 p.74-85x0022-16947nnas  aDNAL  a20000501b20000508c00000000  aINDdRF1  aNon-US 7aarticle02668naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153072001700171100002100188245008900209300001400298500001500312520098900327650002301316650001601339650002401355650001801379650001301397650002201410650001601432650001701448650001501465650001001480650001501490650001001505650002101515650002801536650003801564650001701602650001101619650002101630650001001651650001101661650002501672650000901697650003201706650001501738653002301753653001801776700002701794773007301821852000901894856009201903930003301995945002502028946001302053655001202066IND4417148520221119150509.0090303e200902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441714852DNAL7 a191786472pmid7 a10.1111/j.1753-4887.2008.00142.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Reviewed here are results from longitudinal and cross-sectional research, and a proposal is presented for a lifespan development methodology that uses a sequential design strategy to illuminate the multilevel processes that determine FVC. Conclusions from the review were similar for both cross-sectional and longitudinal research, with fruit and vegetable (FV) preferences and FV accessibility/availability being the most consistent influences on FVC. Furthermore, this review illuminates several methodological issues, offering suggestions to strengthen comparisons between studies. Research designs that incorporate longitudinal, cross-sectional, and time-lag data are warranted. 3atemporal variation 3afood intake 3aexperimental design 3ameta-analysis 3achildren 3afood availability 3aadolescents 3afood choices 3avegetables 3ayouth 2aAdolescent 2aChild 2aChild, Preschool 2aCross-Sectional Studies 2aDietxstatistics & numerical data 2aDiet Records 2aFemale 2aFood Preferences 2aFruit 2aHumans 2aLongitudinal Studies 2aMale 2aSurveys and Questionnaires. 2aVegetables 0aliterature reviews 0afruits (food)1 aDzewaltowski, David A.0 tNutrition reviews.g2009 Feb., v. 67, no. 2 p.65-76x0029-66437nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1753-4887.2008.00142.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090413b20090508c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/03/30  aOther US 7aarticle01604naa a2200265 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245007600128300001200204520087100216650002401087650001401111650002501125650001301150700001801163773007901181852000901260930003301269945001301302946001101315655001201326IND2321984120221119150508.0010711e20010402ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232198412DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUpadhyaya, A.10aWater table fluctuations due to canal seepage and time varying recharge  ap. 1-8.  aTransient water table variation in an unconfined horizontal aquifer, lying between two canals located at different elevations above the impermeable barrier and receiving time varying recharge, is predicted by obtaining an analytical solution to the linearized Boussinesq equation. The proposed solution is for the generalized form of time varying recharge and has been obtained by applying an indigenously devised transformation to the flow governing equation. The solution for constant rate of recharge, a special case of the proposed solution, is compared with the existing analytical solution and almost identical values of water table rise are obtained. The effect of constant recharge, exponentially decreasing recharge and a combination of constant and exponentially decreasing recharge on the water table rise is analyzed with the help of a numerical example. 3amathematical models 3aequations 3agroundwater recharge 3aaquifers1 aChauhan, H.S.0 tJournal of hydrology.g2001 Apr. 2, v. 244, no. 1/2 p.1-8x0022-16947nnas  aDNAL  a20010903b20010910c00000000  aINDdRF1  aNon-US 7aarticle02789naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149072000900158072000900167100002200176245011400198300001600312500002400328520116700352650002901519650001401548650002501562650002001587650002301607650004701630650002401677650001601701650002801717650002101745650001801766650002701784650001201811650002301823650001801846650002101864650002201885653003101907700003101938700002001969773010301989852000902092856008902101930003302190945002502223946001102248655001202259IND4423286720140725000000.0090718e20090917xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442328672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2009.05.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF200 0aF600 0aF1101 aMiñano, Hilda S.10aMolecular characterization and analysis of somaclonal variation in chrysanthemum cultivars using RAPD markers  ap. 238-243.  aIncludes references  aMolecular characterization using RAPD analysis was carried out in eight cut flowers and two pot plant cultivars of chrysanthemum. Three of them ('Refocus', 'Red Reagan', and 'Sheena Select') were established in vitro and the occurrence of somaclonal variation was studied using the same molecular technique. Two induction media (MS+0.1mgl⁻¹ NAA+0.1mgl⁻¹ BA, and MS+2.0mgl⁻¹ IAA+0.5mgl⁻¹ Kinetin), and two proliferation media (MS+0.1mgl⁻¹ NAA+0.2mgl⁻¹ BA, and MS+4.0mgl⁻¹ IAA+2.0mgl⁻¹ Kinetin) were employed in order to evaluate the effect of the medium composition in the shoots' stability. Likewise, the effect of the culture age was considered in assessing genetic stability. Monthly subcultures were carried out, identifying the origin and history of the shoots, throughout a nine-month proliferation period followed by acclimatization. Molecular markers were obtained in every subculture cycle and from the acclimatized plants. Only one shoot from the 7th subculture of the cultivar 'Refocus' showed a different band pattern. The use of RAPD for chrysanthemum cultivar characterization and somaclonal variation detection is discussed. 3aChrysanthemum morifolium 3acultivars 3asomaclonal variation 3agenetic markers 3aDNA fingerprinting 3arandom amplified polymorphic DNA technique 3agermplasm screening 3acut flowers 3apotted flowering plants 3ain vitro culture 3aculture media 3anaphthaleneacetic acid 3akinetin 3aindole acetic acid 3adose response 3amicropropagation 3agenetic stability 0aMurashige and Skoog medium1 aGonzález-Benito, M.

For both batch and continuous tests, parameters based on total cell volume (TCV) were found to be less sensitive than those related to cell densities. The above observation mainly occurred because, under the stresses from metal toxicants evaluated in this and a previous study, the mean cell volume (MCV) of algae increased considerably. The increase of MCV compensates for the effects brought about by the reduction in cell density and eventually results in less variation in TCVs. This study shows that parameters based on cell density are quite sensitive and ideal for the estimation of NOECs. In addition, comparison of the NOEC values derived from different culture techniques shows that the continuous method generally yields lower NOEC values than that obtained by the batch tests. The results of this study also indicate that the NOEC provides more protection to the test organism than the effective concentration at 10% growth reduction (EC10). For toxicity test methods that produce small variations among replicates, the NOEC is still a good indicator of low toxic effect. Furthermore, for the continuous algal toxicity test, a relatively simple approach is proposed to determine the NOEC values based on the algal culture's control charts. The proposed method produced identical results as those based on conventional hypothesis-testing methods. 3aphytotoxicity 3aalgae 3atesting 3abioassays 0aalgae and seaweeds1 aChen, C.Y.0 tEnvironmental toxicology and chemistry.g2000 June, v. 19, no. 6 p.1589-1596x0730-72687nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1897/1551-5028(2000)019<1589:NOECIB>2.3.CO;23Available from publisher's Web site  a20010402b20010411c00000000  aINDdRAE  aOther US 7aarticle02231naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001400127245015600141300001800297520100400315650001801319650001501337650001501352650002501367650002001392650001501412650002701427650002201454650001401476650002301490653003201513653002001545700001601565700001201581700001201593700002501605700001401630773007501644852000901719930003301728945002501761946001101786655001201797IND4376226120221119150934.0051122e200510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437622612DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The transferred Ara residue was shown to be beta-(1 leads to 3)-linked to O-3 of the non-reducing terminal Araf residues of the oligosaccharide using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy together with glycosyl composition and glycosyl linkage composition analyses. The 2AB-labeled arabino-octasaccharide was the most effective acceptor substrate analyzed, although arabino-oligosaccharides with a degree of polymerization between 4 and 7 were also acceptor substrates. Maximum ArapT activity was obtained at pH 6.5-7.0, and 20 degrees C in the presence of 25 mM Mn(2+) and 0.5% Triton X-100. 3aVigna radiata 3amung beans 3ahypocotyls 3apentosyltransferases 3aenzyme activity 3amicrosomes 3acarbohydrate structure 3aspectral analysis 3aarabinose 3aplant biochemistry 0aarabinopyranosyltransferase 0aarabinopyranose1 aKonishi, T.1 aIto, Y.1 aOno, H.1 aOhnishi-Kameyama, M.1 aMaeda, I.0 tPhytochemistry.g2005 Oct., v. 66, no. 20 p.2418-2425x0031-94227nnas  aDNAL  a20120409b20120504c00000000  aINDdRSCe2005/12/07  aNon-US 7aarticle03699naa a2200817 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146072001700163100001500180245008400195300001800279500001500297520126700312650002301579650001301602650002701615650005801642650002201700650002101722650002801743650002601771650002201797650002201819650001001841650002201851650001501873650002501888650001101913650002601924650001901950650001501969650002501984650002702009650002602036650002402062650006702086650001802153650002302171650002302194650002402217650002302241650002402264650002602288650003202314650002802346650007602374650002102450650003102471653001902502653002802521653002502549653002702574700001802601700001902619700001602638700001502654700001602669700001602685700001502701773007502716852000902791930003302800945002502833946001102858655001202869IND4376226320221119150602.0051122e200510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437622632DNAL7 a161262392pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aLipkin, A.13aAn antimicrobial peptide Ar-AMP from amaranth (Amaranthus retroflexus L.) seeds  ap. 2426-2431.  a2019-12-05  aA 30-residue antimicrobial peptide Ar-AMP was isolated from the seeds of amaranth Amaranthus retroflexus L. essentially by a single step procedure using reversed-phase HPLC, and its in vitro biological activities were studied. The complete amino acid sequence of Ar-AMP was determined by Edman degradation in combination with mass spectrometric methods. In addition, the cDNA encoding Ar-AMP was obtained and sequenced. The cDNA encodes a precursor protein consisting of the N-terminal putative signal sequence of 25 amino acids, a mature peptide of 30 amino acids and a 34-residue long C-terminal region cleaved during post-translational processing. According to sequence similarity the Ar-AMP belongs to the hevein-like family of antimicrobial peptides with six cysteine residues. In spite of the fact that seeds were collected in 1967 and lost their germination capacity, Ar-AMP retained its biological activities. It effectively inhibited the growth of different fungi tested: Fusarium culmorium (Smith) Sacc., Helminthosporium sativum Pammel., King et Bakke, Alternaria consortiale Fr., and Botrytis cinerea Pers., caused morphological changes in Rhizoctonia solani Kuhn at micromolar concentrations and protected barley seedlings from H. sativum infection. 3aplant biochemistry 3apeptides 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3areversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3aBotrytis cinerea 3aThanatephorus cucumeris 3aantifungal properties 3asequence analysis 3aFusarium culmorum 3aseeds 3acomplementary DNA 3aAlternaria 3aamino acid sequences 3ahevein 3aBipolaris sorokiniana 3aplant genetics 3afungicides 3anucleotide sequences 3aAmaranthus retroflexus 2aAmaranthusxchemistry 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnti-Infective Agentsxisolation & purificationxpharmacology. 2aBinding Sites 2aChitinxmetabolism 2aCloning, Molecular 2aCysteinexchemistry 2aDNA, Complementary 2aFungixdrug effects 2aHordeumxmicrobiology 2aMicrobial Sensitivity Tests 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPeptidesxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aSeedsxchemistry 2aSequence Analysis, Protein 0aplant proteins 0amolecular sequence data 0aCochliobolus sativus 0aAlternaria consortiale1 aAnisimova, V.1 aNikonorova, A.1 aBabakov, A.1 aKrause, E.1 aBienert, M.1 aGrishin, E.1 aEgorov, T.0 tPhytochemistry.g2005 Oct., v. 66, no. 20 p.2426-2431x0031-94227nnas  aDNAL  a20080313b20080404c00000000  aINDdRSCe2005/12/07  aNon-US 7aarticle02348naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245009200126300001600218520129200234650001301526650001301539650001401552650001101566650001601577650002401593650001101617650001101628650001101639650001101650650001301661650001201674650001201686650001601698650001001714651001001724700001701734700001301751773008401764852000901848930003301857945001301890946001101903655001201914IND2201628220221119150623.0991116e19990322ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220162822DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMas-Pla, J.10aGroundwater resources and quality variations caused by gravel mining in coastal streams  ap. 197-213.  aWe study the effects of gravel mining on the aquifer-river system in the Baix Fluvia area (NE Spain). Field data show that instream mining has caused a decline of the water-table head of the unconfined aquifer along the Fluvia river. Further, dredging in its lowermost reaches reduces its stage and decreases its slope to zero, which facilitates mixing with sea-water, and thus salty-water intrusion from the river into the aquifer. A dimensionless solution of the Boussinesq's equation is derived to estimate the water-table shape and the amount of groundwater lost as runoff for any given decline of the river stage. A flow and solute transport finite-element model is also used to calculate groundwater loses for the Fluvia case. We find that results of the general analytical solution are consistent with those of the numerical model, which reproduces the actual layered aquifer and a more appropriate domain geometry. Finally, the observed chloride distribution and time evolution are broadly reproduced using the numerical model. It shows that significant chloride plumes develop after the cone of depression of the nearby wells reaches the river. However, a natural clean-up takes place in the absence of pumping when the natural water gradient turns completely towards the river. 3aaquifers 3adredging 3aequations 3agravel 3agroundwater 3amathematical models 3amining 3amixing 3arivers 3arunoff 3aseawater 3asolutes 3astreams 3awater table 3awells 3aSpain1 aMontaner, J.1 aSola, J.0 tJournal of hydrology.g1999 Mar. 22, v. 216, no. 3/4 p.197-213x0022-16947nnas  aDNAL  a20000104b20000110c00000000  aINDdRF1  aNon-US 7aarticle03839naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142072001700160072001700177100001400194245014400208300001600352500001500368520187800383650001302261650002302274650002002297650001702317650001002334650002002344650001802364650001402382650002302396650002402419650001402443650002402457650002102481650001702502650001602519650004702535650001202582650001302594650002102607650002402628650002502652650005102677650001102728650002502739650000902764650001902773650002402792653002302816653001802839653001202857700001602869700001702885773010202902852000903004856008103013930003303094945002503127946001303152655001203165IND4430088620221119150457.0091218e201001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443008862DNAL7 a200088132pmid7 a10.3382/ps.2009-002322doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Fish oil is the most common LC n-3 PUFA supplement used but is unsustainable and reduces the oxidative stability of the mat. The objective of this experiment was to compare fresh fish oil (FFO) with fish oil encapsulated (EFO) in a gelatin matrix (to maintain its oxidative stability) and algal biomass at a low (LAG, 11), medium (MAG, 22), or high (HAG, 33 g/kg of diet) level of inclusion. The C22:6n-3 contents of the FFO, EFO, and MAG diets were equal. A control (CON) diet using blended vegetable oil was also made. As-hatched 1-d-old Ross 308 broilers (144) were reared (21 d) on a common starter diet then allocated to treatment pens (4 pens per treatment, 6 birds per pen) and fed treatment diets for 21 d before being slaughtered. Breast and leg meat was analyzed (per pen) for fatty acids, and cooked samples (2 pens per treatment) were analyzed for volatile aldehydes. Concentrations (mg/100 g of meat) of C20:5n-3, C22:5n-3, and C22:6n-3 were (respectively) CON: 4, 15, 24; FFO: 31, 46, 129; EFO: 18, 27, 122; LAG: 9, 19, 111; MAG: 6, 16, 147; and HAG: 9, 14, 187 (SEM: 2.4, 3.6, 13.1) in breast meat and CON: 4, 12, 9; FFO: 58, 56, 132; EFO: 63, 49, 153; LAG: 13, 14, 101; MAG: 11, 15, 102; HAG: 37, 37, 203 (SEM: 7.8, 6.7, 14.4) in leg meat. Cooked EFO and HAG leg meat was more oxidized (5.2 mg of hexanal/kg of meat) than the other meats (mean 2.2 mg/kg, SEM 0.63). It is concluded that algal biomass is as effective as fish oil at enriching broiler diets with C22:6 LC n-3 PUFA, and at equal C22:6n-3 contents, there is no significant difference between these 2 supplements on the oxidative stability of the meat that is produced. 3achickens 3avolatile compounds 3apoultry feeding 3achicken meat 3aalgae 3anutritive value 3aencapsulation 3aaldehydes 3achemical structure 3aoxidative stability 3afish oils 3aomega-3 fatty acids 3afeed supplements 3afeed rations 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aAnimals 2aChickens 2aDietxveterinary 2aDietary Supplements 2aEukaryotaxchemistry 2aFatty Acids, Omega-3xchemistryxpharmacology. 2aFemale 2aFish Oilsxchemistry 2aMale 2aMeatxanalysis 2aOxidation-Reduction 0aalgae and seaweeds 0aalgal biomass 0ahexenal1 aGibbs, R.A.1 aGivens, D.I.0 tPoultry science.g2010 Jan., v. 89, no. 1 p.150-159dPoultry Science Associationx0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps.2009-002323Available from publisher's Web site  a20100301b20100305c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/02/11  aOther US 7aarticle02566naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001800129245016000147300001600307500001500323520148100338650001101819650002201830650001301852650001801865650002001883650001101903650003201914650001601946650001301962653001401975653001501989700001202004773009602016852000902112930003302121945001302154946001302167655001202180IND2042029120221119150448.0940915e199401  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204202912DNAL7 a163491592pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDalsgaard, T.10aNitrate reduction in a sulfate-reducing bacterium, Desulfovibrio desulfuricans, isolated from rice paddy soil: sulfide inhibition, kinetics, and regulation  ap. 291-297.  a2019-12-05  aFrom the second-highest dilution in a most-probable-number dilution series with lactate and sulfate as substrates and rice paddy soil as the inoculum, a strain of Desulfovibrio desulfuricans was isolated. In addition to reducing sulfate, sulfite, and thiosulfate, the strain also reduced nitrate to ammonia. The latter process was studied in detail, since the ability to reduce nitrate was strongly influenced by the presence of sulfide. Sulfide inhibited both growth on nitrate and nitrate reduction. A 70% inhibition of the nitrate reduction rate was obtained at 127 micromolar sulfide, and growth was inhibited by 50% at approximately 320 micromolar sulfide and was not detectable above 700 micromolar sulfide. In contrast, sulfate reduction was not affected at concentrations of up to 5 mM. After growth with sulfate, an induction period of 2 to 4 days was needed before nitrate reduction started. When nitrate and sulfate were present simultaneously, only sulfate was reduced, except when sulfate was present at very low concentrations (4 micromolar). At higher sulfate concentrations (500 micromolar), nitrate reduction was temporarily halted. Tbe affinity for nitrate uptake was extremely high (Km = 0.05 micromolar) compared with that for sulfate uptake (Km = 5 micromolar). Thus, at low nitrate concentrations this bacterium is favored relative to denitrifiers (Km = 1.8 to 13.7 micromolar) or other nitrate ammonifiers (e.g., Clostridium spp. [Km = 500 micromolar]). 3asulfur 3anitrate reduction 3asulfates 3aion transport 3anutrient uptake 3aanions 3aDesulfovibrio desulfuricans 3apaddy soils 3anitrates 0areduction 0ainhibition1 aBak, F.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g1994 Jan., v. 60, no. 1 p.291-297x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL  a19941004b19941021c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle04147naa a2200781 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142072001700160072001700177072001700194100001500211245014800226300001400374500001500388520182200403650002402225650001802249650002402267650002202291650002102313650001602334650002002350650001602370650002102386650001602407650002002423650001402443650001602457650001002473650001702483650001802500650001402518650001202532650002802544650003302572650003002605650001402635650001302649650002802662650001502690650006402705650003402769650004602803650000902849650000902858650001502867650005602882653002702938653001502965653001702980653002502997653001603022700001503038700001403053700001303067700001203080773010003092852000903192856008103201930003303282945002503315946001303340655001203353IND4430088320221119150506.0091218e201001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443008832DNAL7 a200087972pmid7 a10.3382/ps.2009-002432doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The birds were weighed and randomly allotted to 1 of 3 treatments at d 19 (3 treatments x 7 replicates x 6 birds). The treatments comprised a control group in which saline was injected at d 21, an LPS-treated group in which LPS (3 mg/kg of BW) was injected at d 21, and finally a berberine and LPS-treated group in which berberine (15 mg/kg of BW) was orally administered from d 19 to d 24 with LPS injection (3 mg/kg of BW) at d 21. Injection of LPS alone decreased (P < 0.01) weight gain, feed intake, and feed conversion compared with the control and the berberine-administered group. Relative liver weight was increased (P < 0.05) in the LPS-treated group 72 h postinjection compared with the control and the berberine-treated group. Total counts of white blood cells and lymphocytes were also increased (P < 0.05) in the LPS-treated group 72 h postinjection. The heterophil concentration of the LPS-treated group was greater (P < 0.05) than that of both the control and the berberine-administered group 24 h postinjection. Broilers in the LPS-treated group had greater (P < 0.05) total serum protein compared with birds in the control and the berberine-administered group both 24 and 72 h postinjection. In addition, the plasma interleukin-6 level of the LPS-treated group was significantly elevated (P < 0.01) at 24 h compared with that of the control and the berberine-administered group. Our results indicate that LPS injection initiated a series of physiological changes typical of an acute phase response in broiler chickens. These effects were largely mitigated by oral administration of berberine. 3alipopolysaccharides 3atissue weight 3aoral administration 3aprotective effect 3abroiler chickens 3alymphocytes 3aliveweight gain 3aheterophils 3aEscherichia coli 3ablood serum 3afeed conversion 3aberberine 3afeed intake 3aliver 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-6 3ainjection 2aAnimals 2aBerberinexpharmacology 2aBlood Cell Countxveterinary 2aBody Weightxdrug effects 2aCell Line 2aChickens 2aDigestionxdrug effects 2aHybridomas 2aInflammationxchemically inducedxdrug therapyxveterinary. 2aLipopolysaccharidesxtoxicity 2aLiverxanatomy & histologyxdrug effects. 2aMale 2aMice 2aOrgan Size 2aPoultry Diseasesxchemically inducedxdrug therapy. 0aisoquinoline alkaloids 0aleukocytes 0ablood plasma 0aacute phase response 0abody weight1 aPiao, X.S.1 aKim, S.W.1 aWang, L.1 aLiu, P.0 tPoultry science.g2010 Jan., v. 89, no. 1 p.13-19dPoultry Science Associationx0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps.2009-002433Available from publisher's Web site  a20100301b20100305c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/02/11  aOther US 7aarticle04086naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001300149245016500162300001800327500001500345520189400360650003002254650001802284650002702302650002102329650001002350650003502360650002502395650002302420650002002443650002102463650002102484650002402505650001802529650003402547650002302581650002902604650003102633650004202664650002102706650005802727650003502785650002802820650002102848650003402869650001602903650003502919650002302954650002602977653002703003653001703030653001403047653001903061653003203080653002803112653002503140653001403165700001503179700001603194773009803210852000903308930003303317945001303350946001303363655001203376IND2042232320221119150700.0940926e199407  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204223232DNAL7 a80745072pmid7 aPMC2016402pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaba, T.10aIdentification and characterization of clustered genes for thermostable xylan-degrading enzymes, beta-xylosidase and xylanase, of Bacillus stearothermophilus 21  ap. 2252-2258.  a2019-12-05  aBacillus stearothermophilus 21 is a gram-positive, facultative thermophilic aerobe that can utilize xylan as a sole source of carbon. We isolated this strain from soil, purified its extracellular xylanase and D-xylosidase, and analyzed the two-step degradation of xylan by these enzymes (T. Nanmori, T. Watanabe, R. Shinke, A. Kohno, and Y. Kawamura, J. Bacteriol. 172:6669-6672, 1990). An Escherichia coli transformant carrying a 4.2-kbp chromosomal segment of this bacterium as a recombinant plasmid was isolated. It excreted active beta-xylosidase and xylanase into the culture medium. The plasmid was introduced into UV-sensitive E. coli CSR603, and its protein products were analyzed by the maxicell method. Proteins harboring beta-xylosidase and xylanase activities were identified, and their molecular masses were estimated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyarylamide gel electrophoresis to be 75 and 40 kDa, respectively. The values were identical to those of proteins prepared from cells of B. stearothermophilus 21. The genes for both enzymes were encoded in a 3.4-kbp PstI fragment derived from the 4.2-kbp chromosomal segment. The nucleotide sequence of the 4.2-kbp segment was accordingly determined. The beta-xylosidase gene (xylA) is located upstream of the xylanase gene (xynA) with a possible promoter and a Shine-Dalgarno sequence. The latter gene is preceded by two possible promoters and a Shine-Daligarno sequence that are located within the 3'-terminal coding region of the former. The two genes thus appear to be, at least partly, expressed independently which was experimentally confirmed in E. coli by deletion analysis. The xynA gene was found to belong to cellulase-xylanase family F, possessing six regions that are highly conserved in this family. However, the beta-xylosidase has no detectable similarity to any other proteins in the PIR data base (release 38.0). 3axylan 1,4-beta-xylosidase 3agene transfer 3agenetic transformation 3astructural genes 3axylan 3aGeobacillus stearothermophilus 3aamino acid sequences 3afood biotechnology 3aenzyme activity 3apromoter regions 3aEscherichia coli 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBase Sequence 2aBiodegradation, Environmental 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNA, Bacterialxgenetics 2aEscherichia colixgenetics 2aGene Expression Regulation, Bacterial 2aGenes, Bacterial 2aGeobacillus stearothermophilusxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aGlycoside Hydrolasesxgenetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMultigene Family 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aTemperature 2aXylan Endo-1,3-beta-Xylosidase 2aXylansxmetabolism 2aXylosidasesxgenetics 0aO-glycoside hydrolases 0aglycosidases 0axyla gene 0agenbank/d28121 0aBacillus stearothermophilus 0amolecular sequence data 0anucleotide sequences 0alyna gene1 aShinke, R.1 aNanmori, T.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g1994 July, v. 60, no. 7 p.2252-2258x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL  a19941004b19941021c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03150naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150072000900168072000900177072000900186072000900195100001600204245016000220300001600380500002400396500001500420520138900435650000901824650001501833650001401848650002301862650001901885650001701904650001901921650002201940650001701962650001101979650002301990650000902013650001102022650001402033650002502047650001402072650001702086650001102103653002202114653001702136653002002153700001802173700001402191700001802205700001802223700001602241773008802257852000902345856008902354930003302443945002502476946001102501655001202512IND4423288720221119150142.0090718e200910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442328872DNAL7 a204167592pmid7 a10.1016/j.meatsci.2009.04.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aS200 0aQ402 0aQ102 0aQ5021 aHayes, J.E.14aThe effect of lutein, sesamol, ellagic acid and olive leaf extract on lipid oxidation and oxymyoglobin oxidation in bovine and porcine muscle model systems  ap. 201-208.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe effect of lutein (100, 200, 300μg/ml), sesamol (500, 1000, 2000μg/ml), ellagic acid (300, 600, 900μg/ml) and olive leaf extract (100, 200, 300μg/ml) on oxymyoglobin oxidation and lipid oxidation in bovine and porcine muscle model systems (25% M. longissimus thoracis et lumborum homogenates) was examined. Radical scavenging activity, using the DPPH assay, and iron-chelating activities of lutein, sesamol, ellagic acid and olive leaf extract were assessed at concentrations ranging from 200 to 1000ppm. The radical scavenging activity was of the order: ellagic acid>sesamol>olive leaf extract>lutein. None of the natural antioxidants examined exhibited iron chelating activity. Following induced lipid oxidation (FeCl₃/sodium ascorbate addition), lipid oxidation and oxymyoglobin oxidation were measured after 24h at 4°C. In bovine and porcine muscle model systems, lipid oxidation decreased (P <0.001) following addition of each of the natural antioxidants relative to the control and antioxidant potency followed the order: sesamol>ellagic acid>olive leaf extract>lutein. Ellagic acid and olive leaf extract decreased oxymyoglobin oxidation (P <0.001) while sesamol increased oxymyoglobin oxidation in both systems. The natural antioxidants examined may have applications in the development of nutritional enhanced meat products with enhanced shelf-life characteristics. 3apork 3asesame oil 3amyoglobin 3alipid peroxidation 3aessential oils 3abeef quality 3aplant extracts 3anatural additives 3aellagic acid 3aolives 3alongissimus muscle 3abeef 3alutein 3aoxidation 3aantioxidant activity 3achelation 3aantioxidants 3aleaves 0alongissimus dorsi 0ameat quality 0alipid oxidation1 aStepanyan, V.1 aAllen, P.1 aO'Grady, M.N.1 aO'Brien, N.M.1 aKerry, J.P.0 tMeat science.g2009 Oct., v. 83, no. 2 p.201-208dElsevier Sciencex0309-17407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meatsci.2009.04.0193Available from publisher's Web site  a20090817b20091002c00000000  aINDdPNNe2009/08/15  aNon-US 7aarticle04354naa a2200733 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142072001700160072001700177072001700194100002200211245016700233300001400400500001500414520213400429650002302563650002102586650003002607650002202637650001802659650001002677650001602687650001502703650002602718650002002744650001002764650002002774650001102794650002002805650002002825650002002845650001502865650002502880650002002905650001602925650004702941650001202988650003903000650003503039650002103074650002603095650002703121650000903148650002903157653002003186653003903206700001903245700001703264700001703281700001403298700001903312700001603331773010003347852000903447856008103456930003303537945002503570946001303595655001203608IND4430089820221119150234.0091218e201001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443008982DNAL7 a200088032pmid7 a10.3382/ps.2009-003082doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aMountzouris, K.C.10aEffects of probiotic inclusion levels in broiler nutrition on growth performance, nutrient digestibility, plasma immunoglobulins, and cecal microflora composition  ap. 58-67.  a2019-12-04  aThe aim of this work was to investigate the effect of inclusion levels of a 5-bacterial species probiotic in broiler nutrition. Five hundred twenty-five 1-d-old male Cobb broilers were allocated in 5 experimental treatments for 6 wk. The experimental treatments received a corn-soybean coccidiostat-free basal diet and depending on the addition were labeled as follows: no addition (C), 10⁸ cfu probiotic/kg of diet (P1), 10⁹ cfu probiotic/kg of diet (P2), 10¹⁰ cfu probiotic/kg of diet (P3), and 2.5 mg of avilamycin/kg of diet (A). Each treatment had 3 replicates of 35 broilers each. Treatment effects on broiler growth performance and biomarkers such as ileal and total tract nutrient digestibility, plasma Ig concentration, and cecal microflora composition were determined. Differences among treatments were considered significant when P [less-than or equal to] 0.05. Overall BW gain was significantly higher in treatment P1 (2,293 g) compared with P2 (2,163 g), C (2,165 g), and P3 (2,167 g), with A (2,230 g) being intermediate and not different from P1. Overall feed conversion ratio values were similar and significantly better for P1 (1.80) and A (1.80) compared with P2 (1.87), C (1.89), and P3 (1.92). Ileal apparent digestibility coefficients (ADC) of CP and ether extract were higher in A. Generally, treatments A and P1 showed an improved total tract ADC for DM, organic matter, ash, ether extract, and AMEn values. The total tract ADC of CP was higher in P1, C, and P2. There were no differences between treatments regarding plasma Ig in 14- and 42-d-old broilers. Treatments P2 and P3 were effective at beneficially modulating cecal microflora composition. In particular, the lower cecal coliform concentration (log cfu/g of wet digesta) was seen in P2 (6.12) and P3 (4.90) in 14- and 42-d-old broilers, respectively, whereas at 42 d, P3 and P2 had the highest Bifidobacterium (8.31; 8.08) and Lactobacillus concentrations (8.20; 7.86), respectively. It is concluded that probiotic inclusion level had a significant effect on broiler growth responses, nutrient ADC, AMEn, and cecal microflora composition. 3adigestible protein 3abroiler chickens 3aintestinal microorganisms 3acoliform bacteria 3aLactobacillus 3aileum 3aantibiotics 3abiomarkers 3anutrient availability 3afeed conversion 3acecum 3amedicated feeds 3adosage 3aBifidobacterium 3aliveweight gain 3aimmunoglobulins 3aprobiotics 3ametabolizable energy 3abroiler feeding 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aAnimals 2aCecumxdrug effectsxmicrobiology. 2aChickensxgrowth & development 2aDietxveterinary 2aDigestionxphysiology 2aImmunoglobulinsxblood 2aMale 2aProbioticsxpharmacology 0ablood chemistry 0aapparent digestibility coefficient1 aTsitrsikos, P.1 aPalamidi, I.1 aArvaniti, A.1 aMohnl, M.1 aSchatzmayr, G.1 aFegeros, K.0 tPoultry science.g2010 Jan., v. 89, no. 1 p.58-67dPoultry Science Associationx0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps.2009-003083Available from publisher's Web site  a20100302b20100403c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/02/11  aOther US 7aarticle01531naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245013400128300001400262500001500276520042700291650001500718650001800733650001300751650001800764650001700782650002100799650002300820650001200843650001900855651001600874653001900890653001800909653000900927700001900936700001900955773007900974852000901053930003301062945001301095946001301108655001201121IND2196575520221119150345.0990121e199806  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219657552DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchmidt, E.L.10aMill trial confirms control of lumber graystain and sticker shadow after fumigation of southern hardwood logs with methyl bromide  ap. 50-52.  a2019-12-05  aFumigation of hardwood logs effectively prevented non-microbial sapwood discolorations (graystain) and sticker shadow in a mill trial of white ash, sugar hackberry, and red oak in Mississippi.

  1 aPalliyeguru, M.W.C.D.10aEffect of dietary protein concentrates on the incidence of subclinical necrotic enteritis and growth performance of broiler chickens  ap. 34-43.  a2019-12-04  aAn experiment was conducted to quantify the effects of 3 nutritionally complete (similar protein and energy) corn-based diets that contained different dietary protein concentrates (potato-CP 76%, fish-CP 66%, or a mixture of soy proteins, soybean meal-CP 48%, and full-fat soy-CP 36%) on the incidence of spontaneously occurring subclinical necrotic enteritis (NE) in broiler chickens. A total of 1,260 birds were placed into 18 solid floor pens (70 birds per pen) and fed 1 of the 3 experimental diets from 15 to 31d of age. The weight gains and feed intakes of the birds fed the potato- and fish-based diets were lower (P < 0.001) than those of the birds fed the soy-based diets. Weight gain:feed intake ratio and mortality rate were not affected (P > 0.05) by dietary treatment The birds fed the potato-based diets had a higher incidence of necrotic lesions in the duodenum (P < 0.001) and proximal jejunum (P < 0.01) than those fed the soy-based diets. The chickens fed the potato-based diet had a higher (P < 0.001) proportion of moderate to severe duodenal and distal ileal hemorrhages and liver lesions than the birds fed the soy-based diet. There was also a higher (P < 0.05) level of serum antibodies for Clostridium perfringens α toxin in birds fed the potato-based diet compared with the other 2 diets. The birds fed the fish-based diet had a similar (P > 0.05) incidence of subclinical NE in comparison to the birds fed the soy-based diet, although there was a higher incidence of intestinal hemorrhagic lesions. The differences in incidence of subclinical NE were not consistent with the relatively small differences in amino acid content between the diets or in the contents of nonstarch polysaccharides. However, the potato protein-based diet had higher trypsin inhibitor activity and a lower lipid content that could have contributed to the increased incidence of subclinical NE. 3atrypsin inhibitors 3afish protein concentrates 3apolysaccharides 3abroiler chickens 3aduodenum 3adisease severity 3aliveweight gain 3ajejunum 3afeed supplements 3abroiler feeding 3alesions (animal) 3aileum 3afeed intake 3aamino acid composition 3amortality 3alipid content 3apotato protein 3anecrotic enteritis 3asoy protein 3ahemorrhage 3adisease incidence 2aAnimal Feedxanalysis 2aAnimal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aAnimals 2aChickens 2aDietxveterinary 2aDietary Proteinsxpharmacology 2aEnteritisxpathologyxprevention & control. 2aIntestinesxpathology 2aPoultry Diseasesxprevention & control 2aWeight Gainxdrug effects 0asubclinical diseases 0aprotein concentrates 0adietary protein1 aRose, S.P.1 aMackenzie, A.M.0 tPoultry science.g2010 Jan., v. 89, no. 1 p.34-43dPoultry Science Associationx0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps.2009-001053Available from publisher's Web site  a20100301b20100305c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/02/11  aOther US 7aarticle03926naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142072001700160100001500177245010500192300001600297520185200313650002402165650002702189650002602216650001202242650002302254650001402277650001402291650001202305650005102317650007002368650007702438650005102515650001402566650004902580650006802629650006802697650004902765650006702814650004802881650001202929651001402941653002002955653002902975700001903004700001603023700001803039700001603057773010203073852000903175856008103184930003303265945002503298946001303323655001203336IND4431401120221119150207.0100115e201002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443140112DNAL7 a200752722pmid7 a10.3382/ps.2009-004242doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aJindal, N.10aDetection and molecular characterization of enteric viruses from poult enteritis syndrome in turkeys  ap. 217-226.  aThis study was conducted to detect and characterize enteric viruses [rotavirus, turkey astrovirus-2 (TAstV-2), reovirus, and turkey coronavirus] from cases of poult enteritis syndrome (PES) in Minnesota turkeys. Of the intestinal contents collected from 43 PES cases, 25 were positive for rotavirus and 13 for small round viruses by electron microscopy (EM). Of the enteric virus-positive cases by EM (n = 27), 16 cases had rotavirus or small round viruses alone and the remaining 11 cases had both viruses. None of the cases were positive for reovirus or coronavirus by EM. However, with reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR), 40 cases (93%) were positive for rotavirus, 36 (84%) for TAstV-2, and 17 (40%) for reovirus. None of the cases were positive for turkey coronavirus by RT-PCR. The viruses from all cases were detected either alone or in combination of 2 or 3 by RT-PCR. Thus, 8 (19%) cases were positive for a single virus, whereas a combination of viruses was detected in the remaining 35 (81%) cases. The rota-TAstV-2 combination was the most predominant (n = 18 cases). Fifteen cases were positive for all 3 viruses. The rotaviruses had sequence homology of 89.8 to 100% with previously published sequences of turkey rotaviruses at the nucleotide level. The TAstV-2 had sequence homology of 84.6 to 98.7% with previously published TAstV-2, whereas reoviruses had sequence homology of 91.6 to 99.3% with previously published sequences of turkey reoviruses. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that rota- and reoviruses clustered in a single group, whereas TAstV-2 clustered in 2 different groups. In conclusion, a larger number of PES cases was positive for rotavirus, TAstV-2, and reovirus by RT-PCR than with EM. The presence of more than one virus and changes at the genetic level in a virus may affect the severity of PES in turkey flocks. 3amicrobial detection 3amolecular conformation 3ahemorrhagic enteritis 3aturkeys 3adisease prevalence 3aphylogeny 3aRotavirus 2aAnimals 2aAstroviridae Infectionsxveterinaryxvirology. 2aAvastrovirusxclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aCoronavirus, Turkeyxclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aEnteritis, Transmissible, of Turkeysxvirology 2aPhylogeny 2aPoult Enteritis Mortality Syndromexvirology 2aRNA, Viralxclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aReoviridaexclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aReoviridae Infectionsxveterinaryxvirology. 2aRotavirusxclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aRotavirus Infectionsxveterinaryxvirology. 2aTurkeys 3aMinnesota 0aenteric viruses 0apoult enteritis syndrome1 aPatnayak, D.P.1 aChander, Y.1 aZiegler, A.F.1 aGoyal, S.M.0 tPoultry science.g2010 Feb., v. 89, no. 2 p.217-226dPoultry Science Associationx0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps.2009-004243Available from publisher's Web site  a20100318b20100403c00000000  aINDd3CTe2010/02/18  aOther US 7aarticle03922naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142072001700160072001700177100001800194245009200212300001500304520218500319650001202504650001902516650001502535650002002550650001402570650002102584650001602605650001602621650001902637650001602656650002002672650001402692650002402706650001102730650001602741650001202757650003502769650003002804650002102834650001102855650002602866650003002892650002802922650001202950651001102962653003402973700001503007700002403022773010103046852000903147856008103156930003303237945002503270946001303295655001203308IND4430090220221119150257.0091218e201001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443009022DNAL7 a200088072pmid7 a10.3382/ps.2009-002942doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aGulde, V.A.L.10aUse of dietary thyroxine as an alternate molting procedure in spent turkey breeder hens  ap. 96-107.  aIn the turkey industry, molting is traditionally achieved by reducing photoperiod and withdrawing feed and water for several days. Although it is the most effective method, this practice is discouraged in Canada and alternative strategies need to be established. Thyroid hormone levels naturally change during molt, and dietary thyroxine (T₄) supplementation was previously shown to induce molt in chickens. This study aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of supplemental dietary T₄ in inducing molt in spent turkey breeder hens. One hundred twenty 75-wk-old hens were randomly divided into 4 groups (5 floor pens/replicates, 5 hens each) with the control group kept under a 14-h photoperiod and fed a breeder's diet throughout, whereas hens from the 3 other groups were supplemented with 40 ppm (45.76 mg/kg) T₄ for 10 d. One treatment group was maintained under 14 h of light and fed a breeder's diet, whereas the 2 others were subjected to a drop in photoperiod to 6 h during or after supplementation and then were fed a maintenance diet. Egg production, feed intake, BW, molt, and plasma levels of T₄, prolactin, and luteinizing hormone were measured. All treated hens ceased laying by d 20; however, several individuals spontaneously returned to lay when left on 14 h of light, suggesting incomplete involution of the reproductive tract. Supplementation significantly reduced feed consumption and induced rapid BW loss. All hens returned to their initial weight by the end of the experiment. Most treated hens initiated molt by d 8 of supplementation and all completed molt by d 37. Plasma T₄ in treated hens increased significantly by d 3 (P < 0.05) and remained significantly higher than in controls until d 9 (P < 0.01). Levels returned to initial values by d 35. Prolactin levels did not appear to be influenced by T₄ but were mainly dependent on photoperiod and reproductive stage, whereas luteinizing hormone levels remained low throughout. In summary, dietary supplementation with 40 ppm (45.76 mg/kg) T₄ was successful in inducing molt in turkey breeder hens. However, dropping the photoperiod was necessary to completely reset the reproductive system. 3aturkeys 3aturkey feeding 3aspent hens 3ainduced molting 3athyroxine 3afeed supplements 3aphotoperiod 3afeed intake 3aegg production 3abody weight 3ablood chemistry 3aprolactin 3aluteinizing hormone 3adosage 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimals 2aBehavior, Animalxdrug effects 2aBody Weightxdrug effects 2aDietxveterinary 2aFemale 2aMoltingxdrug effects 2aOvipositionxdrug effects 2aThyroxinexpharmacology 2aTurkeys 3aCanada 0areproductive tract involution1 aRenema, R.1 aBédécarrats, G.Y.0 tPoultry science.g2010 Jan., v. 89, no. 1 p.96-107dPoultry Science Associationx0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps.2009-002943Available from publisher's Web site  a20100301b20100305c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/02/11  aOther US 7aarticle01995naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002800145245012000173300001600293520088700309650002401196650002001220650002601240650000701266700003001273700002301303700002801326700003001354700003501384773010001419852000901519856008501528930003301613946001101646655001201657IND4422428920221119150330.0090626e200906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442242892DNAL7 a10.1365/s10337-009-0994-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStulzer, Hellen Karine 10aDevelopment and Validation of Stability Indicating LC Method to Quantify Captopril in Tablets of Controlled Release  ap. 123-128.  aAn accurate, simple, reproducible, and sensitive liquid chromatographic method was developed and validated for the captopril determination in controlled release tablets.

Data also were collected on current and future use of technology and usefulness of educational programs and promotional tools. Absence of panel delamination was the most important attribute desired by distributors, followed by shipment arrives in good condition, accessibility of the manufacturer, splice lines tightly matched, plywood face "on-grade," and on-time delivery. The lowest manufacturer ratings were for: manufacturer provides product training; ability to fill rush orders; manufacturer follows up to see that the product meets or exceeds expectations; manufacturer's ability to provide samples, literature, or other support; manufacturer's awareness of distributors 'needs; on-time delivery; and promptness of handling customer complaints. Differences existed in importance scores and manufacturer performance ratings across distributors with different ratios of hardwood plywood sales to total sales, distributors with different levels of total sales volumes, and distributors selling to different price point categories. Just-in-time shipments were currently being employed by 39 percent of all respondents. Other technologies commonly utilized by respondents were electronic data interface, used by 21 percent of respondents, followed by bar coding (17.1%), vendor-managed inventory (13.8%), and the World Wide Web (9.5%). Use of the World Wide Web was predicted to grow the most by 1999, with use increasing by 276 percent, followed by bar coding (226%), electronic data interface (120%), vendor-managed inventory (100%), and just-in-time shipments (22%). 3ahardwood 3amanufacturing 3asurveys 3aplywood 3aNorth America 0awood products0 tForest products journal.g1998 June, v. 48, no. 6 p.23-27x0015-74737nnas  aDNAL  a19990301b19990308c00000000  aINDdJYB  aOther US 7aarticle02318naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002600145245011200171300001600283520116700299650002201466650001601488650000901504650002601513650000701539650001801546650001501564650001501579700002801594700002901622700003101651700002401682773010001706852000901806856008501815930003301900946001101933655001201944IND4422429820221119150301.0090626e200906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442242982DNAL7 a10.1365/s10337-009-1000-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCeni, Danieli Cátia 13aAn LC Ion-Pairing Method for the Determination of Fe(II) in Ferrous Bisglycinate Pharmaceutical Formulation  ap. 189-194.  aA reversed-phase ion-pairing liquid chromatographic method was developed and validated for the assay of Fe(II) in ferrous bisglycinate (Fe-bis-gly) capsules using 4-(2-pyridylazo) resorcinol reagent. The analysis was carried out using a Gemini RP-18 (150 mm x 4.6 mm I.D., particle size 5 μm) analytical column; the mobile phase consisted of a mixture of acetonitrile-water (28:72 v/v) containing 1 mM tetrabutylammonium hydrogensulfate and 1% phosphate buffer (pH 8.0). The flow rate was 1.0 mL min⁻¹ and the detection was achieved with a photodiode array (PDA) detector at 706 nm. The specificity of the method was proved using stress conditions and evaluated using a PDA detector. The data validation showed that the method is specific, fast, accurate, and reproducible for the determination of Fe-bis-gly in dosage form. The response was linear over a range of 1.0-2.6 μg mL⁻¹ (r = 0.9999). The accuracy of the method ranged from 98.02 to 102.75%. The RSD values for intra- and inter-day precision studies were below 1.3 and 1.1%, respectively. There was no interference of the excipients on the determination of the active pharmaceutical ingredient. 3adrug formulations 3aingredients 3airon 3aliquid chromatography 3apH 3aparticle size 3aphosphates 3aresorcinol1 aMartins, Laura Alegria 1 aPereira, Andréa Garcia 1 aFröehlich, Pedro Eduardo 1 aBergold, Ana Maria 0 tChromatographia.g2009 June, v. 69, no. 2 p.189-194dWiesbaden : Vieweg Verlagx0009-58937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1365/s10337-009-1000-83Available from publisher's Web site  a20090626b20090703c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02497naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245008100166300001800247520137900265650001201644650002501656650001901681650001701700650002001717650001501737650001501752650001301767650002101780650002001801650001601821650001101837700001901848773010601867852000901973856008501982930003302067946001102100655001202111IND4422426720221119150222.0090626e200906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442242672DNAL7 a10.1365/s10337-009-1052-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKokot, Zenon J. 10aSimultaneous Determination of Major Constituents of Honeybee Venom by LC-DAD  ap. 1401-1405.  aThe aim of the study was to develop an LC method for honeybee venom analysis, using cytochrome c as an internal standard. The SynChropack C8 6.5 μm, 4.6 x 100 mm column was applied. The bee venom was separated by linear gradient 5-80% B at 30 min (eluent A--0.1% TFA in water, eluent B--0.1% TFA in acetonitrile:water (80:20)). The flow rate of mobile phase was maintained at 1 mL min⁻¹, injection volume: 40 μL, separation temperature: 25 °C. The analysis was monitored at 220 nm. Several honeybee venom constituents were separated and the content of four of them (apamine, mast cell degranulating peptide, phospholipase A₂ and melittin) were determined. By applying this methodology differences in chemical composition of honeybee venom were evaluated. In order to confirm the data obtained, the following steps and parameters were taken into account for the validation of the method: selectivity, precision (injection repeatability, analysis repeatability), accuracy (recovery), linearity and operating range, limit of detection and limit of quantitation. All steps of validation proved that the developed analytical procedure was suitable for its intended purpose (standardization). Due to its simplicity, the developed method can be easily automated and incorporated into routine operations both in the bee venom identification, quality control and assay tests. 3aApoidea 3achemical composition 3achromatography 3acytochrome c 3adetection limit 3ahoney bees 3amast cells 3amelittin 3aphospholipase A2 3aquality control 3atemperature 3avenoms1 aMatysiak, Jan 0 tChromatographia.g2009 June, v. 69, no. 11-12 p.1401-1405dWiesbaden : Vieweg Verlagx0009-58937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1365/s10337-009-1052-93Available from publisher's Web site  a20090626b20090703c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03373naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001900149245008800168300001800256520135300274650001501627650001701642650001801659650001801677650002101695650002501716650002201741650001401763650001801777650002601795650002901821650002901850650002801879650006801907650001101975650001401986650002902000650003402029650002702063650003602090650002402126653002802150653001902178653001902197653001902216653001902235653001902254653001902273653001902292653001902311653001902330653001902349653001902368653001902387653001902406653001902425653001902444700002002463700001402483773009802497852000902595930003302604945001302637946001302650655001202663IND2042238320221119150205.0940926e199407  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204223832DNAL7 a75211582pmid7 aPMC2016702pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPettersson, B.10aSequence analysis of 16S rRNA from mycoplasmas by direct solid-phase DNA sequencing  ap. 2456-2461.  aAutomated solid-phase DNA sequencing was used for determination of partial 16S ribosomal DNA sequences of mycoplasmas. The sequence information was used to establish phylogenetic relationships of 11 different mycoplasmas whose 16S rRNA sequences had not been determined earlier. A biotinylated fragment corresponding to positions 344 to 939 in the Escherichia coli sequence was generated by PCR. The PCR product was immobilized onto streptavidin-coated paramagnetic beads, and direct sequencing was performed in both directions. One previously unclassified avian mycoplasma was found to belong to the Mycoplasma lipophilum cluster of the hominis group. Microheterogeneities were discovered in the rRNA operons of Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides (SC type), confirming the existence of two different rRNA operons. The 16S rRNA sequence of M. mycoides subsp. capri was identical to that of M. mycoides subsp. mycoides (type SC), except that no microheterogeneities were revealed. Furthermore, automated solid-phase DNA sequencing was used to identify a mycoplasmal contamination of a cell culture as Mycoplasma hyorhinis, which proved to be very difficult by conventional methods. The results suggest that the direct solid-phase DNA sequencing procedure is a powerful tool for identification of mycoplasmas and is also useful in taxonomic studies. 3aMycoplasma 3aAcholeplasma 3aribosomal DNA 3aribosomal RNA 3astructural genes 3anucleotide sequences 3asequence analysis 3aphylogeny 2aBase Sequence 2aDNA Primersxgenetics 2aDNA, Bacterialxgenetics 2aDNA, Ribosomalxgenetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMycoplasmaxclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aOperon 2aPhylogeny 2aRNA, Bacterialxgenetics 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 16Sxgenetics 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSequence Homology, Nucleic Acid 2aSpecies Specificity 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/u04657 0agenbank/u04656 0agenbank/u04654 0agenbank/u04655 0agenbank/u04653 0agenbank/u04652 0agenbank/u04651 0agenbank/u04650 0agenbank/u04649 0agenbank/u04648 0agenbank/u04647 0agenbank/u04646 0agenbank/u04644 0agenbank/u04645 0agenbank/u046431 aJohansson, K.E.1 aUhlen, M.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g1994 July, v. 60, no. 7 p.2456-2461x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL  a19941004b19941021c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03393naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150072000900168072000900177072000900186100002200195245010100217300001600318500002400334500001500358520155000373650001101923650002701934650001201961650001701973650002401990650001402014650002002028650001802048650001302066650002602079650002402105650002302129650000902152650002102161650001802182650001902200650001102219650001202230650001502242650003202257651001402289653001402303653001902317653002202336653001702358700001802375700001702393700001802410700001902428700001702447773008802464852000902552856008902561930003302650945002502683946001102708655001202719IND4423290220221119150259.0090718e200910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442329022DNAL7 a204167252pmid7 a10.1016/j.meatsci.2009.05.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL200 0aL600 0aQ5021 aPonnampalam, E.N.10aPolyunsaturated fats in meat from Merino, first- and second-cross sheep slaughtered as yearlings  ap. 314-319.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThis study examined the level of long chain omega-3 and omega-6 polyunsaturated fats, the ratio of polyunsaturated fat to saturated fat (PUFA/SFA) and the ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 (n-6/n-3) fat in sheep grown under grazing conditions in Australia. The sheep genotypes used were Poll Dorsetgrowth xBorder Leicester Merino (PDgxBLM), Poll Dorsetgrowth xMerino (PDgxM), Poll Dorsetmuscling xMerino (PDmxM), Border LeicesterxMerino (BLxM) and MerinoxMerino (MxM). Loin muscles (Longissimus lumborum) collected from 40 ewe and wether sheep slaughtered at 14months of age were processed for fatty acid determination. After frozen storage, 20g samples were minced and a 7g homogenate was processed for muscle lipid extraction using a chloroform:methanol (2:1) procedure. There was an increase in PUFA/SFA as the proportion of Merino genetics increased in the progeny (second-cross<first-cross<Merino), but this was not shown in the n-6/n-3 ratio. The PUFA/SFA trend appeared to be associated with an increase in the level of total polyunsaturated fats, but not a decrease in the level of total saturated fats. The results demonstrate that there is a need to improve the PUFA/SFA content in first- and second-cross animals which are mainly used for meat production in Australia so as to maintain the healthy lipids in meat. Nutritional manipulation through feeding systems or selection of sires for greater heritability of omega-3 fat deposition may be suitable pathways to elevate the ratio of polyunsaturated fatty acids, and in particular omega-3. 3amutton 3afatty acid composition 3agrazing 3aheritability 3aomega-6 fatty acids 3ayearlings 3asire evaluation 3asheep feeding 3agenotype 3asaturated fatty acids 3aomega-3 fatty acids 3alongissimus muscle 3aewes 3aage at slaughter 3alipid content 3afrozen storage 3aMerino 3awethers 3acrossbreds 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 3aAustralia 0aslaughter 0afat deposition 0alongissimus dorsi 0asheep breeds1 aHopkins, D.L.1 aButler, K.L.1 aDunshea, F.R.1 aSinclair, A.J.1 aWarner, R.D.0 tMeat science.g2009 Oct., v. 83, no. 2 p.314-319dElsevier Sciencex0309-17407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meatsci.2009.05.0183Available from publisher's Web site  a20090818b20091002c00000000  aINDdPNNe2009/08/18  aNon-US 7aarticle02854naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150072000900168072000900177072000900186072000900195100001700204245009200221300001600313500002400329500001500353520092700368650001501295650002701310650001901337650001001356650002801366650002301394650002701417650002001444650002401464650002101488650002701509650002001536650002101556650001701577650002501594650002101619650001601640650002501656650002301681650001001704650001901714650001301733650002001746653006001766653002701826700001801853700001601871700001801887700002001905773008801925852000902013856008902022930003302111945002502144946001102169655001202180IND4423290320221119150251.0090718e200910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442329032DNAL7 a204167232pmid7 a10.1016/j.meatsci.2009.05.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ102 0aQ302 0aQ202 0aQ5021 aCabeza, M.C.10aSafety and quality of ready-to-eat dry fermented sausages subjected to E-beam radiation  ap. 320-327.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe inactivation kinetics in the death of Listeria innocua NTC 11288 (more radioresistant than five different strains of Listeria monocytogenes) and Salmonella Enterica serovar Enteritidis and S. enterica serovar Typhimurium by E-beam irradiation has been studied in two types of vacuum-packed RTE dry fermented sausages (“salchichon” and “chorizo”) in order to optimize the sanitation treatment of these products. A treatment of 1.29kGy was calculated to reach the food safety objective (FSO) according to the “zero tolerance” criterion for the three strains. No irradiation treatment was necessary to meet the 10² c.f.u./g microbiological criterion for L. monocytogenes. Dry fermented sausages treated with <=2kGy had negligible sensory (appearance, odour and taste) modifications. Therefore, this treatment produces safe dry fermented sausages with similar sensory properties to the non-irradiated product. 3adried meat 3aSalmonella Typhimurium 3afood packaging 3aodors 3abacterial contamination 3asensory evaluation 3aSalmonella Enteritidis 3afermented foods 3adynamic programming 3avacuum packaging 3aListeria monocytogenes 3adecontamination 3aListeria innocua 3ainactivation 3aappearance (quality) 3afood irradiation 3afood safety 3aradiation resistance 3aready-to-eat foods 3ataste 3afood pathogens 3asausages 3agamma radiation 0aSalmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium 0aSalmonella enteritidis1 ade la Hoz, L.1 aVelasco, R.1 aCambero, M.I.1 aOrdóñez, J.A.0 tMeat science.g2009 Oct., v. 83, no. 2 p.320-327dElsevier Sciencex0309-17407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meatsci.2009.05.0193Available from publisher's Web site  a20090818b20091002c00000000  aINDdPNNe2009/08/18  aNon-US 7aarticle01835naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245008600127300001300213520090400226650001101130650002901141650003501170650001801205650001401223650001101237650002801248650001301276650001501289651001801304700001701322773008001339852000901419930003301428945001301461946001101474655001201485IND2202026020221119150550.0991220e19990510ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220202602DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVerdin, K.L.12aA topological system for delineation and codification of the Earth's river basins  ap. 1-12.  aA comprehensive reference system for the Earth's river basins is proposed as a support to river basin management, global change research, and the pursuit of sustainable development. A natural system for delineation and codification of basins is presented which is based upon topographic control and the topology of the river network. These characteristics make the system well suited for implementation and use with digital elevation models (DEMs) and geographic information systems. A demonstration of these traits is made with the 30-arcsecond GTOPO30 DEM for North America. The system has additional appeal owing to its economy of digits and the topological information that they carry. This is illustrated through presentation of comparisons with USGS hydrologic unit codes and demonstration of the use of code numbers to reveal dependence or independence of water use activities within a basin. 3abasins 3adigital elevation models 3ageographic information systems 3aglobal change 3ahydrology 3arivers 3asustainable development 3atopology 3awatersheds 3aNorth America1 aVerdin, J.P.0 tJournal of hydrology.g1999 May 10, v. 218, no. 1/2 p.1-12x0022-16947nnas  aDNAL  a20000302b20000309c00000000  aINDdRF1  aNon-US 7aarticle02508naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001100129245010300140300001800243500001500261520141000276650002201686650002101708650002701729650001301756653001701769653002001786653001701806653001101823653001901834653001401853700001401867700001901881700001501900700001701915773009801932852000902030930003302039945001302072946001302085655001202098IND2042237820221119150456.0940926e199407  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204223782DNAL7 a163493222pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, A.10aInheritance of strain instability (sectoring) in the commercial button mushroom, Agaricus bisporus  ap. 2384-2388.  a2019-12-05  aThe button mushroom, Agaricus bisporus, is a commercially important cultivated filamentous fungus. During the last decade, the button mushroom industry has depended mainly on two strains (or derivatives of these two strains). Using one of these highly successful strains (strain U1) we examined the phenomenon of strain instability, specifically, the production of irreversible sectors. Three "stromatal" and three "fluffy" sectors were compared with a healthy type U1 strain and with a wild-collected isolate. Compost colonization and fruit body morphology were examined. The main objective of this study, however, was to examine the meiotic stability of the sectored phenotype. Single basidiospores were isolated and subjected to a grain bioassay in which the ability to produce sectors was measured. Our results were as follows: (i) basidiospore cultures obtained from a wild-collected isolate showed no tendency to produce sectors; (ii) approximately 5% of the basidiospore cultures obtained from healthy type U1 strains produced irreversible sectors in the grain bioassay; (iii) the five primary sectors examined produced basidiospore cultures, half of which produced normal-looking growth in the grain bioassay and half of which produced some degree of sectoring; and (iv) the one sectored isolate that represented the F2 generation gave ratios similar to the 1:1 ratio observed for the F1 cultures. 3aAgaricus bisporus 3amushroom compost 3ainheritance (genetics) 3amycelium 0acolonization 0agrowth patterns 0afruit bodies 0agrowth 0afungal anatomy 0avariation1 aBegin, M.1 aKokurewicz, K.1 aBowden, C.1 aHorgen, P.A.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g1994 July, v. 60, no. 7 p.2384-2388x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL  a19941004b19941021c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02015naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001300110245008100123300001400204500001500218520104600233650000901279650002301288650001601311650001801327650001401345650001501359650001401374650001201388650000901400650002201409653001801431700001601449700001901465773007901484852000901563930003301572945001301605946001101618655001201629IND2202686720221119150028.0000223e199906  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220268672DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmit, R.10aArea separation of streamflow in an upland catchment with partial peat cover  ap. 46-55.  a2019-12-05  aThe problem considered here is: how to measure the discharge from a raised mire in terrain that is only partly mire-covered. The approach involves comparison of the stream discharge from a mixed mire and mineral-soil sub-catchment with that from a neighbouring non-mire sub-catchment. Inconclusive results have previously been obtained using naturally occurring chemical tracers, and the validity of an alternative area-separation method is now examined. Estimates of the mire component of discharge derived in this way and summed over periods of 7-12 days agree to within 1 mm day(-1) with estimates of mire discharge obtained by two other methods, namely direct measurement using mire lysimeters, and water-balance calculations using on-site rainfall measurements and evapotranspiration data calculated using the Penman-Monteith formula. The area-separation method may, therefore, be a useful adjunct or alternative to more expensive chemical methods for studying both the water yield of mixed catchments and aspects of peatland hydrology. 3apeat 3aevapotranspiration 3astream flow 3asubwatersheds 3apeatlands 3alysimeters 3ahighlands 3astreams 3arain 3atracer techniques 0awater balance1 aBragg, O.M.1 aIngram, H.A.P.0 tJournal of hydrology.g1999 June, v. 219, no. 1/2 p.46-55x0022-16947nnas  aDNAL  a20000501b20000508c00000000  aINDdRF1  aNon-US 7aarticle01911naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100002000128245005300148300001600201520050100217650002600718650001300744650002300757650003600780650004400816650002200860650003000882650002600912650002200938650002700960650002800987650004501015650005101060650005401111651001001165653003101175700002001206700002101226700001301247700001401260700001601274773007301290852000901363930003301372945001301405946001101418655001201429IND2197137120221119150306.0990222e199809  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219713712DNAL7 a97866462pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aElgamal, M.H.A.10aTwo triterpene saponins from Arenaria filicaulis  ap. 189-193.  aTwo novel triterpenoid saponins, Snatzkein C, (3 beta,20-dihydroxylupan-28-oic acid 3-O-[beta-D-galactopyranosyl-(1 leads to 2)-beta-D-glucopyranosyl]-28-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside) and SnatzkeinD, (3 beta,20-dihydroxy-lupan-28-oic acid 3-O-[beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1 leads to 2)-beta-D-glucopyranosyl]-28-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside), have been isolated from Arenaria filicaulis.

We have noted that even in the absence of apparent cardiovascular disease, persons with type 2 diabetes have an impaired ability to carry out maximal exercise, and the impairment is correlated with insulin resistance and endothelial dysfunction. We hypothesized that administration of a thiazolidinedione (TZD) agent would improve exercise capacity in type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS--Twenty participants with uncomplicated type 2 diabetes were randomly assigned in a double-blind study to receive either 4 mg/day of rosiglitazone or matching placebo after baseline measurements to assess endothelial function (brachial artery diameter by brachial ultrasound), maximal oxygen consumption ({Vdot}O[subscript 2max]), oxygen uptake ({Vdot}O₂) kinetics, and insulin sensitivity by hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp. Measurements were reassessed after 4 months of treatment. RESULTS:--Participant groups did not differ at baseline in any measure. Rosiglitazone-treated participants (n = 10) had significantly improved {Vdot}O[subscript 2max] (19.8 ± 5.3 ml · kg⁻¹ · min⁻¹ before rosiglitazone vs. 21.2 ± 5.1 ml · kg⁻¹ · min⁻¹ after rosiglitazone, P < 0.01), insulin sensitivity, and endothelial function. A change in {Vdot}O[subscript 2max] correlated with improved insulin sensitivity measured by clamp (r = 0.68, P < 0.05) and with improved brachial artery diameter (r = 0.70, P < 0.05). Placebo-treated participants (n = 10) showed no changes in {Vdot}O[subscript 2max] (19.4 ± 5.2 ml · kg⁻¹ · min⁻¹ before rosiglitazone vs. 18.1 ± 5.3 ml · kg⁻¹ · min⁻¹ after rosiglitazone, NS) or brachial artery diameter. CONCLUSIONS:--This is the first known report showing that a TZD improved exercise function in type 2 diabetes. Whether this is due to the observed improvements in insulin sensitivity and/or endothelial function or to another action of the TZD class requires further exploration. 3acardiovascular diseases 3aexercise 3ainsulin resistance 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3aoxygen 3aoxygen consumption 3apatients 3apeople 3aultrasonics 2aAdipose Tissuexanatomy & histology 2aAdult 2aBlood Glucosexmetabolism 2aBody Mass Index 2aBrachial Arteryxpathology 2aDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2xdrug therapyxphysiopathology. 2aDouble-Blind Method 2aExercise 2aFasting 2aGlucose Clamp Technique 2aHumans 2aHyperinsulinism 2aHypoglycemic Agentsxtherapeutic use 2aInsulinxblood 2aMiddle Aged 2aOxygen Consumption 2aPhysical Fitness 2aThiazolidinedionesxtherapeutic use1 aBauer, Timothy A.1 aReusch, Jane E.B.0 tDiabetes care.g2005 Dec., v. 28, no. 12 p.2877-2883dAmerican Diabetes Associationx0149-59927nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2337/diacare.28.12.28773Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01202naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245008100124300001600205520025600221650002500477650001900502650002500521650002300546650003600569650004400605650002200649653002300671700001700694700001400711773007300725852000900798930003300807945001300840946001100853655001200864IND2197138620221119150455.0990222e199809  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219713862DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, J.H.12aA polyacetylenic acetate and a coumarin from Angelica pubescens F. biserrata  ap. 211-213.  a11(S),16(R)-dihydroxy-octadeca-9Z,17-dien-12,14-diyn -1-yl acetate and a new coumarin, columbianetin propionate, were isolated from the dichloromethane extract of the roots of Angelica pubescens f. biserrta along with falcarindiol and bisabolangelone. 3amonocarboxylic acids 3apolyacetylenes 3atraditional medicine 3achemical structure 3achemical constituents of plants 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aspectral analysis 0aangelica pubescens1 aZschocke, S.1 aBauer, R.0 tPhytochemistry.g1998 Sept., v. 49, no. 1 p.211-213x0031-94227nnas  aDNAL  a19990301b19990308c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02741naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245011000130300001600240500001500256520152100271650002501792650004401817650001701861650002201878650001101900650002301911650002501934650001801959650001501977650002201992650002002014650002302034650001602057650001802073653001602091653001902107700001502126700001502141773007302156852000902229930003302238945001302271946001102284655001202295IND2196930120221119150510.0990211e199809  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219693012DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaumgartner, D.14aThe biogenesis of beta-N-(gamma-glutamyl)-4-hydroxymethylphenylhydrazine (Agaritine) in Agaricus bisporus  ap. 465-474.  a2019-12-05  aAccording to the biogenetic scheme of Schutte et al. (An. Quim., 1972, 68, 899), agaritine [AG; beta-N-(gamma-glutamyl)-4-hydroxymethylphenylhydrazine (HMPH)], a constituent of the fruit body of the common mushroom Agaricus bisporus, is generally held to be a shikimate-derived metabolite. A critical evaluation of the methodological basis of this tenet showed it is not supported by the experimental data presented. A major doubt concerns the conditions used for hydrolysis of the hydrazide bond; therefore, two derivatives of HMPH, 2- and 4-nitrobenzaldehyde hydrazones, were synthesized as reference compounds for the assessment of the desglutamyl product. The UV-, IR- and 1H NMR spectroscopic properties of the two new substances are listed. Using (i) the established shikimate-derived metabolite gamma-glutaminyl-4-hydroxybenzene, which co-occurs with AG, as the positive control, (ii) the shikimate-chorismate pathway inhibitor 'glyphosate' as a tool, and (iii) complementary results from physiological experiments, it was demonstrated that there is no de novo synthesis of the desglutamyl moiety of AG in the fruit body. The likely site of AG synthesis is the vegetative hyphae in contact with the wheat straw compost. A speculative scheme is presented for the assembly of AG, which postulates an exogenous origin of both the aryl and the hydrazide moieties of this, resulting, respectively, from the breakdown of lignin by the fungus and the diazotrophic activity of a bacterial commensal in the substratum. 3achemical composition 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3abiosynthesis 3aAgaricus bisporus 3ahyphae 3aphenolic compounds 3abiochemical pathways 3agrowing media 3aglyphosate 3aspectral analysis 3afruiting bodies 3achemical structure 3ametabolites 3ashikimic acid 0aderivatives 0afungal anatomy1 aHoesch, L.1 aRast, D.M.0 tPhytochemistry.g1998 Sept., v. 49, no. 2 p.465-474x0031-94227nnas  aDNAL  a19990405b19990413c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle05819naa a2200841 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002900111040001800140100002300158245018000181300001600361500002400377520296800401650002003369650001403389650001803403650000903421650003303430650002003463650001203483650002003495650001103515650001203526650003303538650004203571650004803613650001103661650002103672650001803693650001903711650002903730650001203759650002403771650002003795650002803815650002103843650001103864650004003875650004003915650002703955650001903982650005904001650005904060650005904119650003604178650002904214650004604243650004804289650003604337650002904373650003504402650003804437650002204475650003904497650001004536650002704546700001704573700001404590700001104604700001804615700001704633700001504650700001604665700002204681773011604703852000904819856007904828856005804907655001204965IND4376467620221119150452.0051204s2005    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437646762DNAL7 a163225462pmid7 a10.1530/rep.1.005572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMunoz-Gutierrez, M14aThe ovarian expression of mRNAs for aromatase, IGF-I receptor, IGF-binding protein-2, -4 and -5, leptin and leptin receptor in cycling ewes after three days of leptin infusion  ap. 869-881.  aIncludes references  aAn experiment was carried out to determine the pattern of follicular expression of mRNAs for aromatase, IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR), IGF-binding protein (IGFBP)-2, -4 and -5, leptin and the long form of the leptin receptor (Ob-Rb) in ten ewes infused with human recombinant leptin (n = 5; 1 [micro]g/h) or saline (n = 5) for 72 h in the luteal phase of the oestrous cycle. At the end of infusion a follicular phase was induced with a luteolytic dose of a prostaglandin F2[alpha] analogue and the ovaries were collected 32 h later. One ovary from each ewe was serially sectioned at 10 [micro]m using a cryostat at -20 °C. All follicles >1 mm in diameter were counted and probed with specific oligoprobes for aromatase, IGF-IR and IGFBP-2, -4 and -5 and specific riboprobes for leptin and Ob-Rb. Leptin mRNA was detected in theca and granulosa cells and Ob-Rb mRNA was detected only in granulosa cells, of some, but not all antral follicles. Leptin doubled the number of follicles with a diameter [>/=]3.5 mm (1.0 ± 0.36 (S.E.M.) vs 2.4 ± 0.24; control vs leptin; P < 0.02) but had no effect on the number of [>/=]1 < 3.5 mm follicles. Leptin had no effect on the number of follicles expressing aromatase mRNA but it decreased significantly the number of follicles expressing mRNA for IGF-IR (10.7 ± 0.79 vs 7.4 ± 0.81; control vs leptin; P < 0.05), IGFBP-2 (10.0 ± 0.82 vs 5.2 ± 0.87; control vs leptin; P < 0.05) and IGFBP-5 (5.2 ± 1.60 vs 1.2 ± 0.30; control vs leptin; P < 0.05). Leptin increased the diameter of IGFBP-2 mRNA-positive follicles (1.5 ± 0.15 vs 2.2 ± 0.31 mm; control vs leptin; P < 0.05) and increased follicular mRNA expression for IGFBP-2 (0.30 ± 0.021 vs 0.39 ± 0.027 arbitrary units; control vs leptin; P < 0.05) and IGFBP-5 (0.46 ± 0.019 vs 0.25 ± 0.053 arbitary units; control vs leptin; P < 0.05). The mRNA for IGFBP-4 was detected in the theca of only two follicles from the control group. Leptin increased the number of follicles expressing Ob-Rb mRNA (0.25 ± 0.25 vs 1.40 ± 1.17; control vs leptin; P < 0.05) but had no effect on the number expressing leptin mRNA. Leptin decreased plasma concentrations of oestradiol (P < 0.05) and increased concentrations of FSH (P < 0.001) and insulin (P < 0.001), with no effect on glucose concentrations. These data show that: (i) ovine granulosa cells express mRNA for Ob-Rb and leptin and (ii) leptin increased the number of follicles [>/=]3.5 mm. Furthermore, the data suggest that suppression of oestradiol production by leptin is not mediated by inhibition of aromatase gene expression. Finally, the data indicate that the action of leptin in ovarian follicles is mediated by the IGF system, because leptin increased mRNA expression of IGFBP-2 and -5. Leptin also decreased the number of follicles expressing IGF-IR and IGFBP-2 and -5. We suggest that these actions of leptin on the IGF system decrease the bioavailability of IGF-I, resulting in decreased oestradiol production. 3abioavailability 3aestradiol 3aestrous cycle 3aewes 3afollicle-stimulating hormone 3agene expression 3aglucose 3agranulosa cells 3ahumans 3ainsulin 3ainsulin-like growth factor I 3ainsulin-like growth factor I receptor 3ainsulin-like growth factor binding proteins 3aleptin 3aleptin receptors 3amessenger RNA 3aprostaglandins 3aunspecific monooxygenase 2aAnimals 2aAromatasexgenetics 2aAutoradiography 2aBlood Glucosexanalysis 2aEstradiolxblood 2aFemale 2aFollicle Stimulating Hormonexblood 2aImage Processing, Computer-Assisted 2aInfusions, Intravenous 2aInsulinxblood 2aInsulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Protein 2xgenetics 2aInsulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Protein 4xgenetics 2aInsulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Protein 5xgenetics 2aLeptinxgeneticsxpharmacology. 2aLuteal Phasexmetabolism 2aOligonucleotides, Antisensexpharmacology 2aOvarian Folliclexdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aOvaryxchemistryxdrug effects. 2aRNA, Messengerxanalysis 2aReceptor, IGF Type 1xgenetics 2aReceptors, Cell Surfacexgenetics 2aReceptors, Leptin 2aRecombinant Proteinsxpharmacology 2aSheep 2aSomatomedinsxgenetics1 aFindlay, P A1 aAdam, C L1 aWax, G1 aCampbell, B K1 aKendall, N R1 aKhalid, M.1 aForsberg, M1 aScaramuzzi, R.

An understanding of the effects of loss of individuals on these populations, and the mechanism of replacement, will be important to conservation. This may be particularly important where wild individuals are used for the increasingly popular conservation strategy of translocation. During the recent translocation of the endangered eastern bristlebird (Dasyornis brachypterus), two monitoring sites were established in the wild source population, one where removals were to take place and another as a control to assess the impact of the removals on the population. The removal of 44 eastern bristlebirds across 3 years from a single area in the source population had no significant detectable impact in the numbers of individuals surveyed. Individuals that were removed appeared to have been replaced within 6 months of their removal, although to a lesser extent in the later part of the study. The origin of the replacement eastern bristlebirds was unknown and the quick recovery was suggested to be a result of juvenile dispersal, perhaps combined with territory uptake by previously non-territorial and non-calling (thus undetectable) individuals within the population. Such a surplus may be a result of insufficient suitable habitat for population expansion, and will also have implications for monitoring populations of rare and cryptic species. It is also suggested that some territorial species may have several mechanisms that can replace losses of individuals from a population. 3abirds 3ahabitats 3alife history1 aFrench, Kristine0 tWildlife research.g2009, v. 36, no. 6 p.516-521dCSIRO Publishingx1035-37127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/WR07186 7aarticle03447naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002000171245022200191300001600413500002400429520169900453650001302152650001902165650002402184650001702208650000902225650001702234650003502251650001102286650002102297650001802318650001102336650001202347650003802359650003502397650004902432650000902481650005702490650000902547650002802556650004202584650005802626650003402684700002102718700002002739773010602759852000902865856005502874655001202929IND4450605720221119150352.0110311e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445060572DNAL7 a207388392pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-3164.2010.00924.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBizikova, Petra10aImmunomapping of desmosomal and nondesmosomal adhesion molecules in healthy canine footpad, haired skin and buccal mucosal epithelia: comparison with canine pemphigus foliaceus serum immunoglobulin G staining patterns  ap. 132-142.  aIncludes references  aPemphigus foliaceus (PF) is the most common canine autoimmune skin disease. In contrast to human PF (hPF), desmoglein-1 is a minor autoantigen in the canine disease. The major autoantigen(s) of canine PF (cPF) remain(s) unknown, which limits the ability to perform mechanistic studies of lesion formation and the development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for this disease. The immunofluorescence patterns of selected desmosomal (desmoglein-1, desmoglein-3, desmocollin-1, desmocollin-3, desmoplakin-1/2, plakoglobin and plakophilin-1) and nondesmosomal adhesion proteins (E-cadherin, claudin-1, zona occludens-1 and occludin) in healthy canine footpad, haired skin and buccal mucosal epithelia were determined using hPF and pemphigus vulgaris sera and specific antibodies. The immunostaining patterns were then compared with that of indirect immunofluorescence staining with 66 cPF sera. Most cPF sera (58 of 66; 88%) exhibited positive staining along keratinocyte margins in the stratum spinosum and stratum granulosum of canine footpad. One serum contained autoantibodies binding solely to stratum granulosum keratinocytes. Concurrent intercellular fluorescence in the stratum basale was limited to seven of 66 cPF sera (11%). Only 12 of 66 cPF sera (18%) also exhibited positive IF staining of the buccal mucosa. This study confirms the immunological heterogeneity of cPF immunoglobulin G autoantibodies. Moreover, the major indirect immunofluorescence staining pattern and the inability of most cPF sera to label the buccal mucosa closely matched that of desmocollin-1. These observations warrant further investigation of desmocollin-1 as a potential major cPF autoantigen. 3aadhesion 3aautoantibodies 3aautoimmune diseases 3adog diseases 3adogs 3afluorescence 3afluorescent antibody technique 3ahumans 3aimmunoglobulin G 3akeratinocytes 3amucosa 2aAnimals 2aCell Adhesion Moleculesxanalysis 2aDesmosomal Cadherinsxanalysis 2aDog Diseasesxbloodximmunologyxmetabolism. 2aDogs 2aFluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirectxveterinary 2aFoot 2aImmunoglobulin Gxblood 2aMouth Mucosaximmunologyxmetabolism. 2aPemphigusxbloodximmunologyxmetabolismxveterinary. 2aSkinximmunologyxmetabolism.1 aLinder, Keith E.1 aOlivry, Thierry0 tVeterinary dermatology.g2011 Apr., v. 22, no. 2 p.132-142dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0959-44937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3164.2010.00924.x 7aarticle03830naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002900111040001800140100002100158245013100179300001600310500002400326520169300350650001302043650001302056650002802069650002102097650001402118650001702132650001202149650000902161650001202170650001202182650001202194650001202206650003302218650006302251650002002314650002502334650001402359650001102373650003502384650002502419650002802444650001802472650002402490650000902514650002502523650004402548650003702592650002902629650004602658650003502704650001202739650003402751650001702785700002002802700002002822700002202842700001802864773011602882852000902998856007903007856005803086655001203144IND4376467320221119150358.0051204s2005    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437646732DNAL7 a163225432pmid7 a10.1530/rep.1.008562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHomer, Hayden A.10aMad2 is required for inhibiting securin and cyclin B degradation following spindle depolymerisation in meiosis I mouse oocytes  ap. 829-843.  aIncludes references  aMad2 is a pivotal component of the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) which inhibits anaphase promoting complex/cyclo-some (APC/C) activity by sequestering Cdc20 thereby regulating the destruction of securin and cyclin B. During mitosis, spindle depolymerisation induces a robust Mad2-dependent arrest due to inhibition of securin and cyclin B destruction. In contrast to mitosis, the molecular details underpinning the meiosis I arrest experienced by mouse oocytes exposed to spindle depolymerisation remain incompletely characterised. Notably, the role of Mad2 and the fate of the anaphase-marker, securin, are unexplored. As shown previously, we find that spindle depolymerisation by nocodazole inhibits first polar body extrusion (PBE) and stabilises cyclin B and cyclin-dependent kinase 1 activity in mouse oocytes. Here we show that stabilisation of cyclin B in nocodazole can be sustained for several hours and is associated with stabilisation of securin. These effects are SAC-mediated as, in oocytes depleted of the majority of Mad2 by morpholino antisense, securin and cyclin B are destabilised and 15% of oocytes undergo PBE. This reflects premature APC/C activation as a mutant form of cyclin B lacking its APC/C degradation signal is stable in Mad2-depleted oocytes. Moreover, homologues do not disjoin during the prolonged meiosis I arrest (> 18 h) induced by nocodaozole indicating that a non-cleavage mechanism is insufficient on its own for resolution of arm cohesion in mammalian oocytes. In conclusion, when all kinetochores lack attachment and tension, mouse oocytes mount a robust Mad2-dependent meiosis I arrest which inhibits the destruction of securin and cyclin B. 3aanaphase 3acohesion 3acyclin-dependent kinase 3adepolymerization 3aextrusion 3akinetochores 3ameiosis 3amice 3amitosis 3amutants 3aoocytes 2aAnimals 2aCarrier Proteinsxmetabolism 2aCell Cycle Proteinsxantagonists & inhibitorsxmetabolism. 2aCells, Cultured 2aCyclin Bxmetabolism 2aCyclin B1 2aFemale 2aFluorescent Antibody Technique 2aHistonesxmetabolism 2aImmunoblottingxmethods 2aMad2 Proteins 2aMeiosisxphysiology 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred Strains 2aMicrotubulesxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aMyelin Basic Proteinxmetabolism 2aNocodazolexpharmacology 2aOligonucleotides, Antisensexpharmacology 2aOocytesxcytologyxmetabolism. 2aSecurin 2aSpindle Apparatusxmetabolism 2aTime Factors1 aMcDougall, Alex1 aLevasseur, Mark1 aMurdoch, Alison P1 aHerbert, Mary0 tReproduction.g2005 Dec., v. 130, no. 6 p.829-843dJournals of Reproduction and Fertility, Ltdx1470-16267nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1530/rep.1.008563Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.srf-reproduction.org/3electronic resource 7aarticle03109naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151100002400169245005400193300001600247500001500263520129400278650001801572650001701590650002601607650000901633650001701642650002001659650001101679650002301690650001401713650001501727650001601742650001601758650002101774650001901795650002901814650001101843650001101854650001101865650004701876650001801923650000901941650004601950650002301996653002202019653003102041653001702072700002202089700001702111700001802128700001702146700002002163700001602183773010202199852000902301856009002310930003302400945001302433946001302446655001202459IND2324714720221119150134.0020104e200108  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232471472DNAL7 a115060562pmid7 a10.1080/07315724.2001.107190492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVasquez Garibay, E.10aIron absorption during recovery from malnutrition  ap. 286-292.  a2019-12-04  aObjective: In infants and children recovering from severe malnutrition, iron deficiency is common, and the ability to absorb iron during such recovery is uncertain. The objective of this study was to determine iron absorption during recovery from malnutrition. Methods: During the later stages of recovery from malnutrition, erythrocyte incorporation of orally administered 58Fe was determined as a surrogate for iron absorption. Based on four indices, subjects were classified as iron-sufficient, iron-deficient or indeterminate. Results: Of the 25 subjects, 9 were classified as iron sufficient, 5 as indeterminate and 11 as iron deficient; all but 5 had evidence of inflammation or infection. Geometric mean erythrocyte incorporation of 58Fe was 32.0% of the dose in the iron-deficient subjects, which was not significantly different (p = 0.073) than the 13.1% in the iron-sufficient subjects. Incorporation of 58Fe by the iron-sufficient subjects did not differ significantly from that by normal subjects in the same age range. Surprisingly, we found no correlation of erythrocyte incorporation of 58Fe and reticulocyte count. Conclusions: Even in the presence of infection or inflammation, iron absorption by children during a late stage of recovery from malnutrition is not impaired. 3areticulocytes 3amalnutrition 3anutrient deficiencies 3airon 3ainflammation 3anutrient uptake 3adosage 3apreschool children 3ainfection 2aAbsorption 2aBody Height 2aBody Weight 2aChild, Preschool 2aCohort Studies 2aErythrocytesxmetabolism 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aInfant 2aIronxbloodxdeficiencyxpharmacokinetics. 2aIron Isotopes 2aMale 2aNutrition Disordersxmetabolismxtherapy. 2aReticulocyte Count 0amineral nutrition 0atrace element deficiencies 0aerythrocytes1 aSantos Torres, I.1 aNelson, S.E.1 aZiegler, E.E.1 aRogers, R.R.1 aJanghorbani, M.1 aFomon, S.J.0 tJournal of the American College of Nutrition.g2001 Aug., v. 20, no. 4 p.286-292x0731-57247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07315724.2001.107190493Available from publisher's Web site  a20020301b20020307c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle01972naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245007900130300001600209500001500225520081000240650002401050650001601074650001501090650002801105650001001133650001201143650002801155650003601183650002001219650001801239650001601257650002301273653002401296653001801320653001501338653002301353700002301376773007301399852000901472930003301481945001301514946001101527655001201538IND2196934220221119150148.0990211e199809  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219693422DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPflugmacher, S.10aTaxonomic distribution of plant glucosyltransferases acting on xenobiotics  ap. 507-511.  a2019-12-05  aO-Glucosyltransferase activities for chlorinated phenols, 2,2-bis-(4-chlorophenyl)-acetic acid (a DDT-metabolite) and indole-3-acetic acid were determined in 59 different plant species and 4 plant cell suspension cultures.

Similar observations were made for N- and S-glucosyltransferase activities acting on chlorinated anilines and 4-chlorothiophenol, respectively. These results indicate that the "green liver" concept previously derived for xenobiotic metabolism in higher plant species is also valid for the O-, N- and S-glucosyltransferases of lower plant species.

Methods: Three diets (low, medium and high fat) were designed for each subject using their food preferences and three-day food records. Each diet was eaten for 28 to 31 days. The diets were self-selected from seven-day sample menus. Twelve male and 13 female runners between 18 and 55 years of age who averaged 42 miles/week participated in the study. Daily food intakes, activity records and weekly palatability/hunger scales were completed. Results: Dietary fat intakes, as a percent of total energy intake (%E), averaged 17%E, 31%E, and 44%E on the low, medium and high fat diets, respectively. Energy consumption was less than their estimated energy expenditure (EEE) on all diets. On the low fat diet, the female runners were consuming approximately 60% of their EEE. As dietary fat increased, the difference between calorie intake and estimated energy expenditure became less and the subjects were less hungry on the two higher fat diets. For all subjects, as energy intakes increased, so did carbohydrate intake. Therefore, carbohydrate intake was not different on the two lower fat diets. Irrespective of gender, calcium and zinc intakes, which were below 1989 RDAs, increased with increasing fat intakes, between the low and medium fat diets. Zinc intake was also higher on the highest fat diet. Essential fatty acid intakes for females on the low fat diet were less than 2.5%E. Half of the female runners ate less than the RDA of calcium and zinc on the low fat diet and Fe on the medium fat diet. Conclusion: This study suggests that endurance runners may not be consuming enough calories on a low fat diet and that increasing dietary fat increased energy consumption. On the low fat diet, essential fatty acids and some minerals (especially zinc) may be too low. A low fat diet could compromise health and performance. 3amen 3awomen 3adietary fat 3anutrient intake 3anutritional status 3afood choices 3afood intake 3aphysical activity 3apalatability 3ahunger 3aenergy intake 3aenergy expenditure 3acarbohydrates 3acalcium 3azinc 3aessential fatty acids 3anutrient deficiencies 2aAdult 2aBody Composition 2aBody Weight 2aCalciumxadministration & dosage 2aDiet Records 2aDietary Fatsxadministration & dosage 2aEnergy Intake 2aEnergy Metabolism 2aFemale 2aFood Preferences 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMineralsxadministration & dosage 2aNutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aRunning 2aVitaminsxadministration & dosage 2aZincxadministration & dosage 0arunners1 aEagen, C.K.1 aRyer-Calvin, S.D.1 aPendergast, D.R.0 tJournal of the American College of Nutrition.g2000 Feb., v. 19, no. 1 p.42-51x0731-57247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07315724.2000.107189133Available from publisher's Web site  a20011202b20011206c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle03972naa a2200721 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072001700164100002700181245014800208300001600356500001500372520179500387650001802182650001302200650002302213650002102236650001802257650002602275650003102301650002002332650003002352650002402382650002002406650001602426650001602442650001402458650001702472650002102489650002302510650001702533650001102550650001402561650002302575650001802598650002602616650003102642650001202673650001602685650001202701650002802713650001002741650002902751650005702780650003402837650001402871651001002885653001202895653002802907653002202935700002402957773009202981852000903073856008503082930003303167945002503200946001303225655001203238IND4417162920221119150431.0090303e200902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441716292DNAL7 a190731912pmid7 a10.1016/j.jip.2008.11.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aCampos-Herrera, Raquel10aScreening Spanish isolates of steinernematid nematodes for use as biological control agents through laboratory and greenhouse microcosm studies  ap. 100-105.  a2019-12-04  aEntomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) are one of the best non-chemical alternatives for insect pest control, with native EPN strains that are adapted to local conditions considered to be ideal candidates for regional biological control programs. Virulence screening of 17 native Mediterranean EPN strains was performed to select the most promising strain for regional insect pest control. Steinernema feltiae (Filipjev) (Rhabditida: Steinernematidae) Rioja strain produced 7%, 91% and 33% larval mortality for the insects Agriotes sordidus (Illiger) (Coleoptera: Elateridae), Spodoptera littoralis (Boisduval) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) and Ceratitis capitata (Wiedemann) (Diptera: Tephritidae), respectively, and was selected as the most promising strain. The S. feltiae Rioja strain-S. littoralis combination was considered the most suitable to develop the Rioja strain as a biocontrol agent for soil applications. The effect of soil texture on the virulence of the Rioja strain against S. littoralis was determined through dose-response experiments. The estimated LC90 to kill larvae in two days was 220, 753 and 4178 IJs/cm2 for soils with a clay content of 5%, 14% and 24%, respectively, which indicates that heavy soils produced negative effects on the virulence of the Rioja strain. The nematode dose corresponding to the LC90 for soils with a 5% and 14% clay content reduced insect damage to Capsicum annuum Linnaeus (Solanales: Solanaceae) plants under greenhouse microcosm conditions. The results of this research suggest that an accurate characterization of new EPN strains to select the most suitable combination of insect, nematode and soil texture might provide valuable data to obtain successful biological control under different ecological scenarios in future field applications. 3asweet peppers 3aAgriotes 3aCeratitis capitata 3aapplication rate 3adose response 3aSpodoptera littoralis 3aentomopathogenic nematodes 3aCapsicum annuum 3abiological control agents 3aSteinernema feltiae 3avegetable crops 3aplant pests 3alethal dose 3avirulence 3ainsect pests 3aland application 3astrain differences 3asoil texture 3alarvae 3amortality 3abiological control 3aclay fraction 3alaboratory techniques 3agreenhouse experimentation 2aAnimals 2aColeoptera. 2aDiptera 2aEnvironment, Controlled 2aMoths 2aPest Control, Biological 2aRhabditidaxisolation & purificationxpathogenicity. 2aSoilxanalysisxparasitology. 2aVirulence 0aSpain 0astrains 0alethal concentration 90 0aAgriotes sordidus1 aGutiérrez, Carmen.0 tJournal of invertebrate pathology.g2009 Feb., v. 100, no. 2 p.100-105x0022-20117nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jip.2008.11.0093Available from publisher's Web site  a20090514b20090608c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/04/22  aOther US 7aarticle01521naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245012100127300001400248520067000262650002200932650001100954650001600965650001400981650001100995650001401006700001701020700002301037773007901060852000901139930003301148945001301181946001301194655001201207IND2200862020221119150129.0990930e199903  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220086202DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLorenz, L.F.14aThe effect of soy protein additions on the reactivity and formaldehyde emission of urea-formaldehyde adhesive resins  ap. 73-78.  aUrea-formaldehyde (UF) resins were modified with soy protein, hydrolyzed soy protein, soy flour, or casein, at 1.5 to 50 percent of UF solids, to determine if modifying the resins would reduce formaldehyde emissions.

Objective: This study examined the effects of an eight-week ketogenic diet rich in n-3 fatty acids on fasting serum lipoproteins and postprandial triacylglycerol (TG) responses. Design: Ten men consumed a low-carbohydrate diet rich in monounsaturated fat (MUFA) and supplemented with n-3 fatty acids for eight weeks. Fasting blood samples were collected before and after one week of habitual diet and on two consecutive days after 2, 4, 6 and 8 weeks of the intervention diet. Postprandial TG responses to a fat-rich test meal were measured prior to and after the intervention diet. Results: Compared to the habitual diet, subjects consumed significantly (p less than or equal to 0.05) greater quantities of protein, fat, MUFA and n-3 fatty acids and significantly less total energy, carbohydrate and dietary fiber. Body weight significantly declined over the experimental period (-4.2 +/- 2.7 kg). Compared to baseline, fasting total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and HDL cholesterol were not significantly different after the intervention diet (+1.5%, +9.7% and +10.0%, respectively). Fasting TG were significantly reduced after the intervention diet (-55%). There was a significant reduction in peak postprandial TG (-42%) and TG area under the curve (-48%) after the intervention diet. Conclusions: A hypocaloric low-carbohydrate diet rich in MUFA and supplemented with n-3 fatty acids significantly reduced postabsorptive and postprandial TG in men that were not hypertriglyceridemic as a group before the diet. This may be viewed as a clinically significant positive adaptation in terms of cardiovascular risk status. However, transient increases in total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol were also evident and should be examined further in regard to which particular subfractions are elevated. 3ahigh density lipoprotein 3ablood lipids 3amen 3aenergy intake 3adietary protein 3adietary fat 3adietary fiber 3atriacylglycerols 3adietary carbohydrate 3arisk factors 3aduration 3amonounsaturated fatty acids 3adietary supplements 2aAdult 2aCardiovascular Diseasesxprevention & control 2aDietary Carbohydratesxadministration & dosagexmetabolism. 2aEnergy Intake 2aFastingxblood 2aFatty Acids, Omega-3xadministration & dosagextherapeutic use. 2aHumans 2aKetosis 2aLipoproteinsxbloodxdrug effects. 2aMale 2aPostprandial Period 2aTriglyceridesxblood 0afatty acids 0aketogenic diets1 aGomez, A.L.1 aKraemer, W.J.0 tJournal of the American College of Nutrition.g2000 June, v. 19, no. 3 p.383-391x0731-57247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07315724.2000.107189353Available from publisher's Web site  a20011101b20011108c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle01912naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146100001400163245006300177300001800240520033100258650002200589650001300611650001100624650001900635650002600654650001200680650002300692650002000715650002200735650002300757650002700780650005000807650003600857650002400893650002700917650005400944651001000998653002401008653002001032700001401052700001501066700001601081700001801097700002201115700001201137700001601149700001601165773007501181852000901256930003301265945002501298946001101323655001201334IND4377536020221119150310.0060131e200512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437753602DNAL7 a162298702pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

In addition, we examined the effect of surfactant protein D (SP-D) on the cytokine response of human monocyte-derived macrophages to these serotypes in vitro. Noncapsulated mannose-containing O3 serotypes (K50/n and K55/n), which react efficiently with SP-D in vitro, triggered high levels of interleukin-1{szligbeta} (IL-1{szligbeta}) and IL-6 production. In vivo, they were more efficiently cleared from the lungs of mice but not from macrophage-depleted mice. They also were more efficiently internalized by alveolar macrophages in vivo. In contrast, galactose-containing O1 serotypes (K2/n and K21a/n), which interact poorly with SP-D, exhibited significantly lower cytokine production and less efficient pulmonary clearance and were ineffectively internalized by alveolar macrophages. These findings are consistent with in vitro results showing that production of IL-1{szligbeta} and IL-6 mRNA and IL-6 protein by human macrophages exposed to mannose-bearing Klebsiella O serotypes is significantly increased by SP-D. Thus, survival of inhaled bacteria in the lung depends partially on the lipopolysaccharide structure of the bacteria and their interactions with innate immunity components. We speculate that an imbalance of host SP-D and therefore cytokine levels may result in high susceptibility of the host to the pathogen.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aKlebsiella pneumoniae 3aanimal models 3aantigens 3abacteria 3ahumans 3ainnate immunity 3ainterleukin-1 3ainterleukin-6 3alipopolysaccharides 3alungs 3amacrophages 3amessenger RNA 3amice 3apathogens 3aserotypes 2aAnimals 2aBacterial Capsulesximmunology 2aCytokinesxbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aImmunity, Innate 2aInterleukin-1xgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aInterleukin-6xgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aKlebsiella Infectionsximmunology 2aKlebsiella pneumoniaeximmunologyxpathogenicity. 2aLungximmunologyxmicrobiology. 2aMacrophagesxdrug effectsximmunology. 2aMale 2aMannoseximmunology 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred BALB C 2aO Antigensximmunology 2aOpsonin Proteinsxpharmacology 2aPulmonary Surfactant-Associated Protein Dxpharmacology 2aRNA, Messengerxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSpleenximmunology1 aOfek, Itzhak1 aCrouch, Erika1 aFriedman, Rotem1 aSirota, Lea1 aKlinger, Gil1 aSahly, Hany1 aKeisari, Yona0 tInfection and immunity.g2005 Dec., v. 73, no. 12 p.8282-8290dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0019-95677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/IAI.73.12.8282-8290.20053Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02012naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001400128245006300142300001600205520074500221650002800966650001700994650002001011650001601031650001301047650001201060650002101072650003201093650001101125650001101136650001101147650002501158650000901183650005101192650001401243651001101257653001601268653001101284653001701295700001501312700001601327700001701343700001501360773006501375852000901440930003301449945001301482946001101495655001201506IND2051486720221119150224.0960531e199603  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205148672DNAL7 a87309322pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSofer, S.10aInterleukin-6 release following scorpion sting in children  ap. 389-392.  aInterleukin-6 levels were measured in the serum of ten children following severe scorpion envenomation. Measurements were taken on arrival, at the emergency room, and 12 and 24 hr after arrival. Interleukin-6 was markedly elevated in the serum of eight out of ten children on arrival. Interleukin-6 levels gradually decreased toward normal values on 12 and 24 hr measurements, but remained above control levels on all measurements. These results imply that signs and symptoms following scorpion envenomation may in part be explained by release of cytokines.

Design: Intervention, with subjects prescribed an energy-restriction diet and exercise program for 32 weeks and body composition measured pre-study and after 12 and 32 weeks. Subjects and Setting: Overweight and obese premenopausal women (n=201) with no overt disease were recruited at six sites into community-based weight loss programs. One hundred and twenty-four women completed all aspects of the study. Intervention: Energy intake was set at 0.8 x resting metabolic rate (RMR) for weeks 1 through 12, 1.0 x RMR for weeks 13 through 20 and 1.2 x RMR for weeks 21 through 32. Energy intake was based on a food exchange table, with the number of food exchanges adjusted to encourage a percent distribution of 55% carbohydrate, 30% fat and 15% protein. Subjects increased their daily walking distance by 3.2 km above pre-study levels. Measures of Outcome: Underwater weighing, seven skinfolds, and leg-to-leg BIA tests were used to assess body composition. Results: A 3 x 3 repeated measures ANOVA revealed no significant difference in detecting change in FFM at 12 and 32 weeks among underwater weighing, BIA and skinfold, (F(4,492)=1.73, p=0.141) (decrease in FFM of 1.0 +/- 3.3 kg, 1.7 +/- 2.2 kg, and 1.4 +/- 3.3 kg respectively, 32 weeks). Conclusions: The leg-to-leg BIA system provides a valid measure of body composition change in overweight premenopausal women during a 32-week community-based weight loss program. 3aexercise 3awomen 3acommunity health 3aobesity 3ameasurement 3aweight control 3abody fat 2aAdipose Tissuexphysiology 2aAdult 2aBody Composition 2aBody Constitution 2aCross-Sectional Studies 2aDiet, Reducing 2aElectric Impedance 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aIntervention Studies 2aMethods 2aMiddle Aged 2aObesityxphysiopathologyxtherapy. 2aPremenopause 2aReproducibility of Results 2aSkinfold Thickness 2aWalking 0abody weight 0aoverweight 0abody composition 0amethodology 0aweight loss diets 0aevaluation1 aNieman, D.C.1 aMelby, C.1 aCureton, K.1 aSchmidt, D.1 aHowley, E.T.1 aHill, Jo.1 aMault, J.R.1 aAlexander, H.1 aStewart, D.J.0 tJournal of the American College of Nutrition.g2001 Feb., v. 20, no. 1 p.26-31x0731-57247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07315724.2001.107190113Available from publisher's Web site  a20020401b20020405c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle01469naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002100110245006900131300001600200520052000216650001400736650001800750650001900768650002300787650003600810650004400846650002200890650001700912651001300929700002000942700001800962773007300980852000901053930003301062945001301095946001101108655001201119IND2197136520221119150156.0990222e199809  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219713652DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFerreira, M.J.U.12aA tetracyclic diterpene and triterpenes from Euphorbia segetalis  ap. 179-183.  aA new tetracyclic diterpene, with a novel carbon skeleton, has been isolated from the acetone extract of the whole plant of Euphorbia segetalis.

Methods: Subjects were 41 healthy men and women aged 18 to 78 years. Weight maintenance energy requirements were established over two weeks during consumption of a control diet with low soluble fiber content. Subjects then consumed a hypocaloric diet for six weeks, either consuming a low soluble fiber control diet or a diet containing 45 g/1000 kcal rolled oats, a whole grain cereal rich in soluble fiber (mean energy deficit -895 +/- 18 kcal/day relative to weight maintenance energy requirements). Changes in body fat and fat-free mass were determined by underwater weighing, and dietary compliance was assessed using the urinary osmolar excretion rate technique. In a final phase of the study, subjects ate ad libitum for six months, and changes in body weight and composition were monitored. Results: There was no significant effect of the oat-containing diet on body weight or composition changes during the hypocaloric regimen or in the subsequent ad libitum period. In addition, fecal energy excretion was not significantly different between groups. However, there were non-significant trends indicating reduced hunger in the oat group compared to controls (frequency of hunger 2.5 +/- 0.5 vs. 3.6 +/- 0.4, P=0.1). In addition, fewer oat subjects were non-compliant (four versus seven subjects dropped out or had urinary osmolar excretions greater than 130% of values predicted from dietary intake), but again the difference was not significant. Conclusions: These results suggest that use of a cereal rich in soluble fiber in a closely monitored hypocaloric feeding regimen does not improve weight loss or dietary compliance. Further studies are needed to examine the possibility that cereals containing soluble fiber may have effects on hunger and dietary compliance that could be important in less tightly controlled protocols than the one described here. 3ahunger 3afood intake 3adietary fiber 3amen 3aurine 3apatient compliance 3awomen 3abody weight 3aoats 3aenergy 3abody composition 3afeces 3aweight loss 3aexcretion 2aAdult 2aAged 2aAvenaxchemistry. 2aBody Compositionxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aEdible Grain. 2aDiet, Reducing 2aDietary Fiberxadministration & dosage 2aFecesxchemistry 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aHungerxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aPatient Compliance 2aWeight Lossxdrug effectsxphysiology. 0adiet1 aMoriguti, J.C.1 aDas, S.K.1 aCorrales, A.1 aFuss, P.1 aGreenberg, A.S.1 aRoberts, S.B.0 tJournal of the American College of Nutrition.g2001 Feb., v. 20, no. 1 p.50-57x0731-57247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07315724.2001.107190143Available from publisher's Web site  a20020401b20020405c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle01994naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245010300129300001600232500002400248520109000272650002701362650003101389650002401420650001301444650002201457650001301479700002001492773009401512852000901606856008901615655001201704IND4461843220221119150059.0110923s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446184322DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEasterly, R.G.10aInquiry–Based Instruction for Students with Special Needs in School Based Agricultural Education  ap. 36–46.  aIncludes references  aEducating students with special needs in school based agricultural education (SBAE) is a problem that should be addressed. While many students in SBAE classes have special needs, contradicting research exists establishing the best method of instruction for students with special needs. Inquiry–based instruction shows some promise, but little is known about its effectiveness in SBAE settings for students with special needs. The purpose of this study was to determine if inquiry–based instruction impacts content knowledge achievement for students with special needs. A one–group pretest–posttest, design was used to determine if students with an Individualized Education Plan (IEP) differed in content knowledge achievement from those students without IEPs. No difference in content knowledge achievement was found between students with IEPs and those without over seven pre and post tests using ANCOVA measures. Based on these findings inquiry–based instruction can be an effective method of instruction for students with special needs and should be used when appropriate. 3aagricultural education 3achildren with disabilities 3aeducational methods 3alearning 3aspecial education 3astudents1 aMyers, Brian E.0 tJournal of agricultural education.g2011, v. 52, no. 2 p.36–46-36–46x1042-05417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.jae-online.org/vol-52-no-2-2011.html3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03112naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001700128245011900145300001600264520103400280650000901314650002701323650002001350650001101370650001001381650001101391650001401402650000901416650002801425650002001453650001701473650001201490650001701502650001201519650002501531650001001556650002001566650003701586650005901623650003701682650001501719650004001734650001701774650004201791650002901833650002501862650003101887650004301918650003901961650003102000650005802031650003402089650006602123651001002189653001502199653002402214653001402238653001602252700001502268773006502283852000902348930003302357945001302390946001102403655001202414IND2060436120221119150104.0971105e199604  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206043612DNAL7 a87352442pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZambrano, F.10aEffects of microcystin-LR on the partial reactions of the Na+-K+ pump of the gill of carp (Cyprinus carpio Linneo)  ap. 451-458.  aSeveral partial reactions of the Na(+)-K(+) pump enzyme were studied in a microsomal fraction derived from the gill of carp (Cyprinus carpio Linneo). We tested the effect of three toxins [(i) microcystin-LR, (ii) microcystin-LR-like toxin component isolated from Microcystis aeruginosa culture and (iii) okadaic acid] on the phosphorylation, ouabain binding and ATPase activity of the Na(+)-K(+) pump. The K(+)-dependent hydrolysis of the Na(+)-dependent phosphorylation of Na(+)-K(+) pump, as well the release of bound ouabain were inactivated in direct proportion to the amount of each toxin treatment. These results indicate that these toxins not only block the hydrolysis of phosphorylated protein at serine and threonine residues, but also inhibit the aspartic dephosphorylation step of the sodium pump enzymes. This inactivation could disrupt the ion homeostasis of the internal medium by blocking the gill function. The blockage of gill activity could be the cause of the massive fish death during blooms of M. aeruginosa. 3acarp 3aMicrocystis aeruginosa 3acyclic peptides 3atoxins 3agills 3asodium 3apotassium 3aions 3aadenosinetriphosphatase 3aphosphorylation 3ainactivation 3aouabain 3aokadaic acid 2aAnimals 2aBinding, Competitive 2aCarps 2aCells, Cultured 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aEnzyme Inhibitorsxmetabolismxpharmacologyxtoxicity. 2aGillsxdrug effectsxenzymology. 2aHydrolysis 2aIndicators and Reagentsxmetabolism 2aMicrocystins 2aMicrosomesxdrug effectsxenzymology. 2aNitrophenolsxmetabolism 2aOctoxynolxchemistry 2aOkadaic Acidxpharmacology 2aOrganophosphorus Compoundsxmetabolism 2aOuabainxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aPeptides, Cyclicxtoxicity 2aPhosphoprotein Phosphatasesxantagonists & inhibitors 2aPhosphorylationxdrug effects 2aSodium-Potassium-Exchanging ATPasexdrug effectsxmetabolism. 3aChile 0ainhibition 0atransport processes 0atransport 0asodium pump1 aCanelo, E.0 tToxicon.g1996 Apr., v. 34, no. 4 p.451-458x0041-01017nnas  aDNAL  a19971201b19971208c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle02154naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100002000128245006600148300001600214520086200230650002301092650001401115650001701129650001901146650001501165650001501180650001301195650001401208650001201222650003001234650002401264650001401288650003201302650003701334650004201371650002901413650001101442650003101453650001901484650000901503650002901512773006501541852000901606930003301615945001301648946001101661655001201672IND2060225620221119150206.0971023e199606  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206022562DNAL7 a88178152pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHabtemariam, S.10aCytotoxicity of extracts from the mushroom Paxillus involutus  ap. 711-713.  aThe cytotoxicity of extracts of freshly collected Paxillus involutus against murine (L929 and RAW 264.7) and human (HeLa and EAhy926) derived cell lines was investigated.

The ethyl acetate extract was cytotoxic in a concentration-dependent manner, with IC50 values between 125 and 250 micrograms/ml. The cytotoxic principle appears to be heat and acid stable, as neither incubation at 37 degrees C for 4 hr nor overnight treatment at pH 0.5 altered the cytotoxicity of the ethyl acetate extract.

This issue was studied in Oryza sativa L. (rice) by conducting a parallel investigation using two molecular markers, amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) and methylation-sensitive amplified polymorphism (MSAP), on two sets of EMS-treated M(0) plants: phenotypically normal and altered. Although more methylation than genetic changes were induced by the EMS-treatments in both sets of plants, the greatest differences were observed in the set of plants with altered phenotypes, suggesting a role of induced epigenetic variation in causing the phenotypic novelties. Moreover, the frequencies of the two types of instabilities induced by the EMS treatment, genetic and epigenetic, are correlated, implicating a common or overlapping mutagenic basis. 3aDNA 3aDNA methylation 3aOryza sativa 3aamplified fragment length polymorphism 3aepigenetics 3agenetic markers 3amutagenicity 3anucleotide sequences 3aphenotype 3arice1 aOu, Xiufang1 aWang, Kaixi1 aDong, Mingyue1 aMan, Guiliang1 aCai, Yi1 aShi, Yu1 aYu, Xiaoming1 aLiu, Bao0 tBotany.g2011 June, v. 89, no. 6 p.417-424dNRC Research PresswJournal:jnl44657x1916-28047nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/b11-0293Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02083naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245007400126300001400200520098100214650002101195650000901216650001101225650002601236650002501262650002601287650002301313650002601336650002601362650003601388651001201424653001301436653001501449653001601464653001501480700001601495700001301511773007101524852000901595930003301604945001301637946001101650655001201661IND2197129120221119150300.0990222e199809  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219712912DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKokubun, T.10aIndoxyl derivatives in woad in relation to medieval indigo production  ap. 79-87.  aThe two precursors of indigo in the woad plant, Isatis tinctoria, were quantified by a new spectrophotometric method involving the formation of a red adduct from indoxyl and rhodanine. In young leaves, approximately 24% of the dry weight was found to be the indoxyl derivatives, indoxyl-3-(5-ketogluconate) (isatan B) and indoxyl 3-O-beta-D-glucoside (indican), in the ratio of approximately 3:1. The older leaves contained a lower concentration of the indoxyl derivatives (up to 14% dry weight). Isatan B in the leaves was found to be relatively unstable towards heat and drying. The traditional method of indigo production used since at least medieval times was reproduced. Analysis revealed that conversion to indigo took place in the initial step, the formation of woad balls. The traditional method reduced side reactions leading to indirubin formation. The conversion efficiency of the indoxyl precursors to indigo was approximately 14% of the theoretical maximum yield. 3aIsatis tinctoria 3adyes 3aleaves 3aquantitative analysis 3abiochemical pathways 3asecondary metabolites 3achemical reactions 3apostharvest treatment 3aprocessing technology 3achemical constituents of plants 3aEngland 0aleaf age 0adry matter 0aderivatives 0aprecursors1 aEdmonds, J.1 aJohn, P.0 tPhytochemistry.g1998 Sept., v. 49, no. 1 p.79-87x0031-94227nnas  aDNAL  a19990301b19990308c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle04206naa a2200829 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001300149245018200162300001800344500001500362520170800377650002702085650001802112650001802130650002002148650002602168650002102194650001402215650002002229650002802249650002502277650002002302650001102322650002002333650002702353650002102380650001302401650002402414650002302438650001802461650002302479650001902502650002002521650002402541650002002565650005002585650002502635650006302660650002802723650002502751650002402776650003002800650004402830653001902874653002502893653001902918653001902937653001802956653002802974653001403002653001903016653002703035653001403062653001703076653001903093653002503112700001503137700001503152700001603167700001603183773009703199852000903296930003303305945001303338946001303351655001203364IND2041643520221119150417.0940825e199405  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204164352DNAL7 a80179272pmid7 aPMC2014962pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHols, P.10aUse of homologous expression-secretion signals and vector-free stable chromosomal integration in engineering of Lactobacillus plantarum for alpha-amylase and levanase expression  ap. 1401-1413.  a2019-12-05  aThe genuine alpha-amylase gene from Bacillus licheniformis (amyL) is not expressed in Lactobacillus plantarum, but replacement of the amyl promoter by a strong L. plantarum promoter leads to efficient expression of the gene and secretion of more than 90% of the alpha-amylase into the culture supernatant. A series of L. plantarum genetic cassettes (transcription and translation with or without secretion) were cloned by translation fusion of random DNA fragments to the silent amyL coding frame in the pGIP212 probe vector (P. Hols, A. Baulard, D. Garmyn, B. Delplace, S. Hogan, and J. Delcour, Gene 118:21-30, 1992). Five different cassettes were sequenced and found to harbor genetic signals similar to those of other gram-positive bacteria. The functions of the cloned cassettes and the cassettes isolated previously from Enterococcus faecalis were compared in E. faecalis and L. plantarum, respectively. All signals were well recognized in L. plantarum, but cassettes isolated from L. plantarum led to a low level of amylase production in E. faecalis, suggesting that the L. plantarum signals are more species specific. Six transcriptional or translational fusions were constructed to express the Bacillus subtilis levanase gene (sacC) in L. plantarum. All of these constructions were capable of inducing levanase production and secretion in the culture supernatant, and, furthermore, L. plantarum strains harboring the most efficient fusions could grow in MRS medium containing inulin as the major carbon source. Finally, a two-step chromosomal integration procedure was used to achieve efficient stabilization of an amylase construction without any residual resistance marker or vector sequence. 3agenetic transformation 3agene transfer 3aalpha-amylase 3arecombinant DNA 3aEnterococcus faecalis 3astructural genes 3asecretion 3aplasmid vectors 3aLactobacillus plantarum 3aamino acid sequences 3agene expression 3asilage 3aenzyme activity 3aBacillus licheniformis 3apromoter regions 3ainoculum 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBacterial Proteins 2aBase Sequence 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNA, Bacterial 2aGene Expression 2aGenetic Engineering 2aGenetic Vectors 2aGlycoside Hydrolasesxbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aInulinxpharmacology 2aLactobacillusxenzymologyxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aProtein Biosynthesis 2aSignal Transduction 2aTransformation, Bacterial 2aalpha-Amylasesxbiosynthesisxgenetics. 0agenbank/x73296 0aintegration plasmids 0agenbank/x71999 0agenbank/x72003 0aamyl promoter 0amolecular sequence data 0aamyl gene 0agenbank/x72002 0aO-glycoside hydrolases 0asacc gene 0aglycosidases 0agenbank/x72001 0anucleotide sequences1 aFerain, T.1 aGarmyn, D.1 aBernard, N.1 aDelcour, J.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g1994 May, v. 60, no. 5 p.1401-1413x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL  a19941004b19941021c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02698naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100001200135245012200147300001600269500002400285500002300309520128500332650001301617650002801630650001201658650001801670650001401688650003101702650002201733650002101755650001001776650001301786650001601799650001901815650001101834650002001845650001701865650002801882650003701910700001901947700002001966700001901986700002502005773010202030852000902132856007502141655001202216IND4461842120221119150238.0110923s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446184212DNAL7 a10.1139/b11-0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFan, Li10aInfluence of arbuscular mycorrhizae on biomass and root morphology of selected strawberry cultivars under salt stress  ap. 397-403.  aIncludes references  aSummary in French.  aTo investigate the influence of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) on biomass and root morphology, a greenhouse experiment was conducted using three elite strawberry (Fragaria × ananassa Duch.) cultivars (‘Kent’, ‘Jewel’, and ‘Saint-Pierre’). They were subjected to three NaCl levels (0, 30, and 60 mmol/L) and were inoculated and noninoculated (control) with AMF Glomus irregulare. The presence of AMF significantly changed root morphology and increased root-length percentages of medium (0.5 mm < root diameter psi ≤ 1.5 mm) and coarse (psi > 1.5 mm) roots, shoot and root tissue biomass, root to shoot ratio (R/S ratio), and specific root length (SRL), regardless of cultivar and salinity. In contrast, salt alone changed root morphology and decreased shoot and root tissue biomass, R/S ratio, and SRL. The AMF colonization rates were reduced linearly and significantly with increasing salinity levels. Cultivars responded differently to AMF than to salt stress. ‘Saint-Pierre’ seemed to be the most tolerant cultivar to salinity, while ‘Kent’ was the most sensitive. Consequently, AMF symbiosis highly enhanced salt tolerance of strawberry plants, which confirmed the potential use of mycorrhizal biotechnology in sustainable horticulture in arid areas. 3aFragaria 3aRhizophagus irregularis 3abiomass 3abiotechnology 3acultivars 3agreenhouse experimentation 3amycorrhizal fungi 3aroot shoot ratio 3aroots 3asalinity 3asalt stress 3asalt tolerance 3ashoots 3asodium chloride 3astrawberries 3asustainable agriculture 3avesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae1 aDalpe, Yolande1 aFang, Chengquan1 aDube, Claudine1 aKhanizadeh, Shahrokh0 tBotany.g2011 June, v. 89, no. 6 p.397-403dNRC Research PresswJournal:jnl44657x1916-28047nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/b11-0283Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01545naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245014700126300001600273520041400289650001600703650001100719650001400730650001400744650001200758650002400770650002200794650001600816653001400832653002400846653001700870700002000887700001400907700001600921700001700937700001400954700002400968773006500992852000901057930003301066945001301099946001101112655001201123IND2061233020221119150128.0980113e199706  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206123302DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBlaghen, M.10aOkadaic acid and its interactions with sodium, potassium, magnesium and calcium ions: complex formation and transport across a liquid membrane  ap. 843-847.  aOkadaic acid, a macrocyclic polyether compound, was shown to mediate the transfer of Na +, K+, Mg2+ and Ca2 + ions from aqueous solution to an organic phase, with a preference for Na+ ions.

The objective of this study was to examine eating in the absence of hunger in adolescents based on their familial predisposition to obesity and current weight status. Thirty-one subjects (16 male, 15 female), who were 13 years of age and born at low risk or high risk for obesity, consumed lunch to fullness. After lunch, subjects had access to different snacks for 15 minutes. Eating in the absence of hunger referred to energy intake from the snacks. Low-risk females consumed two and a half times more calories from snacks than high-risk females and twice as many calories as low-risk and high-risk males when expressed as an individualized percentage of daily allowance for discretionary calories. Normal-weight females consumed two and a half times more calories from snacks than obese females and normal-weight males. The association between eating in the absence of hunger and weight and obesity risk status depended on adolescents' sex and could reflect emerging developmental differences, such as dieting or social desirability.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3ahunger 3aenergy intake 3asnacks 3amales 3arisk factors 3alunch 3aobesity 3aadolescents 3achildhood 3aingestion 3afemales 2aAdolescent 2aBody Mass Index 2aEatingxphysiologyxpsychology. 2aEnergy Intakexphysiology 2aFeeding Behaviorxphysiologyxpsychology. 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aHunger 2aMale 2aObesityxepidemiologyxetiology. 2aRisk Factors 2aSatiationxphysiology 2aSex Factors 2aSocial Desirability 0arisk1 aMoore, Reneé H.1 aStunkard, Albert J.1 aBerkowitz, Robert I.1 aStettler, Nicolas1 aStallings, Virginia A.1 aTanaka, Leeann M.1 aKabay, April C.1 aFaith, Myles S.0 tJournal of the American Dietetic Association.g2010 Dec., v. 110, no. 12 p.1896-1900dAmerican Dietetic Associationx0002-82237nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jada.2010.09.009 7aarticle01933naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245005000126300001600176520087900192650001001071650001601081650001401097650001901111650001801130650001801148650002301166650001101189650002601200650002501226650004401251650002201295700001901317700001801336700001501354700001501369773007301384852000901457930003301466945001301499946001101512655001201523IND2197130420221119150257.0990222e199809  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219713042DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMenhard, B.10aTaxoids from cell cultures of Taxus chinensis  ap. 113-125.  aA cell culture of Taxus chinensis was found to produce taxoids in 4% yield (dry weight) after stimulation with methyl jasmonate.

Two doses were administered i.m. and one dose was given via an isolated ileal loop. At 4 hr after i.v. administration of the toxin at 25 micrograms/kg, 64.6% of the total dose (%TD) was located in the liver, with smaller amounts distributed to the kidneys (1.2%TD), lungs (1.75%TD), heart (0.22%TD), ileum (0.13%TD) and spleen (0.04%TD). A similar distribution was found at 4 hr postdosing in pigs given 75 micrograms/kg, although the liver contained a lower fraction of the total dose, at 46.99%TD, and the kidneys had somewhat more, at 2.19%TD, than the low dose. At the high dose, the fractions of the amount given accounted for by the lungs (0.55%TD), heart (0.23%TD), ileum (0.20%TD) and spleen (0.07%TD) were similar to those at the low dose. The livers of the pigs given 75 micrograms/kg via the ileal loop at 5 hr postdosing contained 49.5% TD and the ileum had 33.94%TD. Smaller amounts were distributed to kidneys (1.04%TD), lungs (0.65%TD) heart (0.81%TD) and spleen (0.16%TD). The livers of both groups dosed at 75 micrograms/kg contained higher concentrations of toxin, but lower percentages of the total dose than the livers of pigs dosed at 25 micrograms/kg. Larger increases in serum arginase in the two 75 micrograms/kg groups were associated with histological evidence of more severe liver damage than at the 25 pg/kg dose. Analysis of radiolabeled compounds from hepatic tissue using fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry determined that the primary constituent was [3H]2H-MCLR, but two minor radioactive components were also isolated. These findings indicate that [3H]2H-MCLR is rapidly concentrated in the liver of swine whether given i.v. or via an isolated ileal loop, that at extremely toxic doses uptake is slowed, and that it is as toxicologically active as the parent compound. 3aurine 3ablood serum 3aalgae 3aspatial distribution 3ahepatotoxins 3abile 3aanimal organs 3atoxicity 3aenzyme activity 3aswine 2aAnimals 2aArginasexblood 2aBilexmetabolism 2aCyanobacteria 2aFemale 2aLiverxmetabolism 2aMarine Toxinsxpharmacokineticsxurine. 2aPeptides, Cyclicxpharmacokineticsxurine. 2aSwine 2aTissue Distribution 2aTritiumxdiagnostic use. 0alesions 0aalgae and seaweeds1 aTwardock, A.R.1 aHaschek, W.M.1 aChoi, B.W.1 aRinehart, K.L.1 aBeasley, V.R.0 tToxicon.g1997 June, v. 35, no. 6 p.937-953x0041-01017nnas  aDNAL  a19980201b19980206c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02511naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245007800126300001400204520133200218650002301550650002201573650001401595650001901609650001801628650001301646650001201659650002001671650002401691650001301715650002201728650001501750650001201765650001101777650002101788650001501809650001801824653001601842653001501858700001301873700001801886773007101904852000901975930003301984945001302017946001102030655001202041IND2197128520221119150223.0990222e199809  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219712852DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGupta, A.K.12aA HgCl2 insensitive and thermally stable inulinae from Aspergillus oryzae  ap. 55-58.  aAn extracellular inulinase (EC 3.2.1.7) from Aspergillus oryzae growing on inulin-containing medium was purified by CM-cellulose and Sephadex G-200 column chromatographies to electrophoretic homogeneity. The purified inulinase cleaved beta-linked fructose from inulin and sucrose with S/I ratio of 2.4. It had a remarkable stability in heat, losing only 41 and 32% of its inulin hydrolytic activity after 2 h at 90 degrees and 100 degrees, respectively. The pattern of thermal denaturation of both the inulin and sucrose hydrolytic activities was nearly the same. SO4(2-) and Fe3+ were strong inhibitors of inulin and sucrose hydrolytic activities, whereas Ba2+ was an activator. Hg2+ inhibited sucrose hydrolytic activity but increased inulin hydrolytic activity of inulinase. It is proposed that inulinase has different sites for binding of sucrose and inulin and these are either very close to or partially overlapping. The sulphydryl group is in the non-overlapping zone of the sucrose binding site and its modification by HgCl2 results in an enhanced inulin hydrolytic activity. In the presence of inulin and sucrose together, both substrates compete with each other resulting in reduced activity compared with that observed with individual substrates. Inulinase had a temperature optima of 55 degrees and a mass of 38 kd. 3aAspergillus oryzae 3amercuric chloride 3ainulinase 3aheat stability 3aculture media 3afructose 3asucrose 3aenzyme activity 3aambient temperature 3asulfates 3aenzyme inhibitors 3ahydrolysis 3amercury 3abarium 3amolecular weight 3ametal ions 3abinding sites 0aferric ions 0asubstrates1 aGill, A.1 aKaura, Ainna.0 tPhytochemistry.g1998 Sept., v. 49, no. 1 p.55-58x0031-94227nnas  aDNAL  a19990301b19990308c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle03389naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001900164245010800183300001600291520129900307592002801606650001501634650001001649650003801659650001901697650001401716650002101730650001601751650003101767650001301798650001301811650001501824650001001839650001901849650001801868650003701886650002001923650002301943650001101966650001901977650003101996650001102027650003702038650002002075650002902095650003702124650000902161650001902170650003502189650004002224650002102264650004802285650002402333650003202357650003202389650001602421700001802437700002202455700002102477700002102498773008202519856008102601852000902682655001202691IND4470953620221119234641.0141112e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447095362DNAL7 a218724362pmid7 a10.1016/j.nut.2011.05.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYimit, Dilshat10aEffects of soybean peptide on immune function, brain function, and neurochemistry in healthy volunteers  ap. 154-159.  aOBJECTIVE: Soybeans, an excellent source of dietary peptides, have beneficial effects on health. We investigated the effect of the soybean peptide on immune function, brain function, and neurochemistry in healthy volunteers. METHODS: Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) was used to analyze brain cerebral blood flow. The A and DA levels in the serum were analyzed by ELISA kit. The total number of leukocytes was recorded with a standard counter. Flow cytometry was used to assess lymphocyte subset levels. RESULTS: Cell numbers were upregulated in the group that had fewer leukocytes but downregulated in the group with more leukocytes. For the lymphocyte-rich type, lymphocyte counts tended to decrease, accompanied by an increase in granulocyte numbers. For the granulocyte-rich type, granulocyte counts tended to increase, but lymphocyte counts also increased. The numbers of CD11b⁺ cells and CD56⁺ cells increased significantly. Soybean peptide decreased the adrenalin level in plasma but increased the level of dopamine. Near-infrared spectroscopy showed significant increases in the amplitudes of θ, α-2, and β-L frequency bands after the ingestion of peptides. CONCLUSION: Soybean peptides can modulate cellular immune systems, regulate neurotransmitters, and boost brain function.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood flow 3abrain 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aflow cytometry 3aingestion 3alymphocyte count 3alymphocytes 3anear-infrared spectroscopy 3apeptides 3asoybeans 3avolunteers 2aAdult 2aCD11b Antigen. 2aCD56 Antigen. 2aBrainxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aDopaminexblood 2aEpinephrinexblood 2aFemale 2aFlow Cytometry 2aGranulocytesxdrug effects 2aHumans 2aImmunity, Cellularxdrug effects 2aLeukocyte Count 2aLeukocytesxdrug effects 2aLymphocyte Subsetsxdrug effects 2aMale 2aNeurochemistry 2aNeurotransmitter Agentsxblood 2aPeptidesximmunologyxpharmacology. 2aReference Values 2aSoybean Proteinsximmunologyxpharmacology. 2aSoybeansxchemistry 2aSpectroscopy, Near-Infrared 2aT-Lymphocytesxdrug effects 2aYoung Adult1 aHoxur, Parida1 aAmat, Nurmuhammat1 aUchikawa, Kimono1 aYamaguchi, Nobuo0 tNutrition.g2012 Feb., v. 28, no. 2 p.154-159dElsevier Inc.x0899-90077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nut.2011.05.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01745naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001900146245012400165300001400289520064600303592002800949650002100977650000900998650001401007650001101021650001401032650000701046700002401053700002601077700002201103700002301125700002801148700002101176773009701197856008001294852000901374655001201383IND60083131320221122154057.0141101e20131201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008313132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ab.2013.08.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCerda, Jose F.10aElectrochemical determination of heme-linked pKₐ values and the importance of using fluoride binding in heme proteins  ap. 75-77.  aThe ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) spectroelectrochemical measurements of heme proteins in the presence of a heme-bound fluoride ion can be used as a probe for heme-linked ionizations of acid–base groups in the heme pocket.

Although this method has been widely used by many research groups, a systemic study on the optimal conditions and fundamental parameters influencing the experimental outcomes has been lacking, including the effect of peptide extraction methods, the extent of pre-fractionation, and the choice of pH range. In this study, we compared the effect of different parameters on the numbers of peptides and proteins identified using two complex mouse proteomes. The results indicated that extraction of peptides from immobilized pH gradient (IPG) strips by sequential elution of increasingly organic solvents provided the highest number of peptide identification. In addition, we showed that approximately 45 more unique proteins were identified for every additional fraction collected during peptide IEF. Although narrow pH ranges provided higher resolution in peptide separation as expected, different pH ranges yielded similar numbers of peptide and protein identification. Overall, we demonstrated that the extraction solvent influenced the numbers of peptide and protein identification and quantitatively demonstrated the advantage of extensive fractionation and the performance of different pH ranges in practice.  aPublisher supplied data 3afractionation 3aisoelectric focusing 3aliquid chromatography 3amice 3apH 3apeptides 3aproteins 3aproteomics 3asolvents 3atandem mass spectrometry1 aLiang, Xu1 aWang, Jing-Rong1 aWong, Kam-Wai V.1 aHsiao, Wen Luan1 aZhou, Hua1 aJiang, Zhi-Hong1 aLiu, Liang0 tAnalytical biochemistry.g2013 Dec. 1, v. 443, no. 1 p.27-33dElsevier Inc.x0003-26977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ab.2013.07.0473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02615naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001900146245009200165300001600257520155200273592002801825650001801853650001401871650001001885650001501895650001601910650003001926650002901956650002601985700002502011700002002036700002002056773010002076856008002176852000902256655001202265IND60083133120221123001045.0141101e20131215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008313312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ab.2013.09.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrown, Adam J.10aBlock decoys: Transcription-factor decoys designed for in vitro gene regulation studies  ap. 205-210.  aTranscription-factor decoys are short synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides that sequester cognate transcription factors and prevent their binding at target promoters. Current methods of decoy formation have primarily been optimized for potential therapeutic applications. However, they are not ideally suited to in vitro investigations into multi-transcription factor-mediated processes that may require multiple regulatory elements to be inhibited in varying combinations. In this study we describe a novel method for chimeric decoy formation in which blocks containing discrete transcription factor binding sites are combined into circular molecules. Unlike currently available methods, block decoys allow rapid construction of chimeric decoys targeting multiple regulatory elements. Further, they enable fine-tuning of binding-site copy ratios within chimeras, allowing sophisticated control of the cellular transcriptional landscape. We show that block decoys are exonuclease-resistant and specifically inhibit expression from target binding sites. The potential of block decoys to inhibit multiple elements simultaneously was demonstrated using a chimeric decoy containing molar optimized ratios of three regulatory elements, NF-κB-RE, CRE, and E-box. The chimeric decoy inhibited expression from all three elements simultaneously at equivalent levels. The primary intended use of block decoys is in vitro gene regulation studies in which bespoke chimeras can be rapidly constructed and utilized to determine a promoter’s functional regulation.  aPublisher supplied data 3abinding sites 3achimerism 3agenes 3alandscapes 3amethodology 3aoligodeoxyribonucleotides 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors1 aMainwaring, David O.1 aSweeney, Bernie1 aJames, David C.0 tAnalytical biochemistry.g2013 Dec. 15, v. 443, no. 2 p.205-210dElsevier Inc.x0003-26977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ab.2013.09.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02367naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001200146245014700158300001600305520100600321592002801327650002001355650001001375650001601385650001001401650001301411650001701424650001901441650002601460650002201486650002401508650002301532650003601555700001801591700001301609700001401622700001301636700001901649700001601668700001701684700001901701773010001720856008001820852000901900655001201909IND60083133320221122231326.0141101e20131215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008313332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ab.2013.08.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Shu12aA liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry-based generic detection method for biochemical assay and hit discovery of histone methyltransferases  ap. 214-221.  aEpigenetic modifications of the genome, such as DNA methylation and posttranslational modifications of histone proteins, contribute to gene regulation.

In vitro challenge assays were used to screen approximately 500 bacterial isolates from 20 Korean greenhouse soils for inhibition of diverse plant pathogens. One isolate, Bacillus subtilis ME488, suppressed the growth of 39 of 42 plant pathogens tested. Isolate ME488 also suppressed the disease caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cucumerinum on cucumber and Phytophthora capsici on pepper in pot assays. Polymerase chain reaction was used to screen isolate ME488 for genes involved in biosynthesis of 11 antibiotics produced by various isolates of B. subtilis. Amplicons of the expected sizes were detected for bacD and bacAB, ituC and ituD, and mrsA and mrsM involved in the biosynthesis of bacilysin, iturin, and mersacidin, respectively. The identity of these genes was confirmed by DNA sequence analysis of the amplicons. Bacilysin and iturin were detected in culture filtrates from isolate ME488 by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectroscopy and by thin layer chromatography, respectively. Detection of mersacidin in ME488 culture filtrates was not attempted. Experiments reported here indicate that B. subtilis ME488 has potential for biological control of pathogens of cucumber and pepper possibly due to the production of antibiotics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus subtilis 3asoil bacteria 3afungal antagonists 3acucumbers 3apeppers 3aFusarium oxysporum f. sp. cucumerinum 3aPhytophthora capsici 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3afungal diseases of plants 3abiological control 2aAntibiosis 2aAntifungal Agentsxmetabolism 2aBacillus subtilisxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxphysiology. 2aBacterial Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCapsicumxmicrobiology 2aCucumis sativusxmicrobiology 2aDipeptidesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aFusariumxphysiology 2aPhytophthoraxphysiology 2aPlant Diseasesxmicrobiology 2aSoil Microbiology1 aKong, Hyesuk1 aBuyer, Jeffrey S.1 aLakshman, Dilip K.1 aLydon, John1 aKim, Sang-Dal1 aRoberts, Daniel P.0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2008 Aug., v. 80, no. 1 p.115-123dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl35319x0175-75987nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/193543Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-008-1520-43Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle03012naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100001800188245006800206300001400274506007600288520134900364592002801713506003701741650002401778650001601802650001401818650000901832650001601841650002301857650001401880650001101894650002501905650004201930650001201972650002001984650002602004650002402030650000902054650002302063650001302086650002702099650003002126650002002156650004202176650003702218700002102255700001802276773010702294856004802401852000902449655001202458IND50061793520221207083933.0130320e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006179352DNAL7 a230859862pmid7 aPMC35475892pmcid7 a10.1007/s00359-012-0768-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRiede, Tobias14aThe acoustic effect of vocal tract adjustments in zebra finches  ap. 57-69.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aVocal production in songbirds requires the control of the respiratory system, the syrinx as sound source and the vocal tract as acoustic filter. Vocal tract movements consist of beak, tongue and hyoid movements, which change the volume of the oropharyngeal–esophageal cavity (OEC), glottal movements and tracheal length changes. The respective contributions of each movement to filter properties are not completely understood, but the effects of this filtering are thought to be very important for acoustic communication in birds. One of the most striking movements of the upper vocal tract during vocal behavior in songbirds involves the OEC. This study measured the acoustic effect of OEC adjustments in zebra finches by comparing resonance acoustics between an utterance with OEC expansion (calls) and a similar utterance without OEC expansion (respiratory sounds induced by a bilateral syringeal denervation). X-ray cineradiography confirmed the presence of an OEC motor pattern during song and call production, and a custom-built Hall-effect collar system confirmed that OEC expansion movements were not present during respiratory sounds. The spectral emphasis during zebra finch call production ranging between 2.5 and 5 kHz was not present during respiratory sounds, indicating strongly that it can be attributed to the OEC expansion.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aTaeniopygia guttata 3aX-radiation 3aacoustics 3abeak 3aradiography 3arespiratory system 3asongbirds 3atongue 2aAcoustic Stimulation 2aAdaptation, Physiologicalxphysiology 2aAnimals 2aCineradiography 2aEsophagusxphysiology 2aFinchesxphysiology 2aMale 2aModels, Biological 2aMovement 2aOropharynxxphysiology 2aPredictive Value of Tests 2aVideo Recording 2aVocal Cordsxinnervationxphysiology. 2aVocalization, Animalxphysiology1 aSchilling, Nadja1 aGoller, Franz0 tJournal of comparative physiology.g2013 Jan., v. 199, no. 1 p.57-69dSpringer-Verlagx0340-75947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00359-012-0768-4  aDNAL 7aarticle02349naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024004200133040001800175100001500193245007500208300001400283506007600297520099300373592002801366506003701394650001301431650001101444650001501455650001501470650002201485650002401507650003701531650001101568650002501579650002401604650001401628650004601642650002201688650001801710700001901728773009201747856005501839852000901894655001201903IND4434156020221207052801.0150416e201003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443415602DNAL7 a193975822pmid7 aPMC29982402pmcid7 a10.1111/j.1541-0420.2009.01243.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Song10aImproved Logrank‐Type Tests for Survival Data Using Adaptive Weights  ap. 30-38.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aFor testing for treatment effects with time‐to‐event data, the logrank test is the most popular choice and has some optimality properties under proportional hazards alternatives. It may also be combined with other tests when a range of nonproportional alternatives are entertained. We introduce some versatile tests that use adaptively weighted logrank statistics. The adaptive weights utilize the hazard ratio obtained by fitting the model of Yang and Prentice (2005, Biometrika 92, 1–17). Extensive numerical studies have been performed under proportional and nonproportional alternatives, with a wide range of hazard ratios patterns. These studies show that these new tests typically improve the tests they are designed to modify. In particular, the adaptively weighted logrank test maintains optimality at the proportional alternatives, while improving the power over a wide range of nonproportional alternatives. The new tests are illustrated in several real data examples.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abiometry 3amodels 3astatistics 2aAlgorithms 2aBiometryxmethods 2aComputer Simulation 2aData Interpretation, Statistical 2aHumans 2aLongitudinal Studies 2aModels, Statistical 2aMortality 2aOutcome Assessment, Health Carexmethods. 2aSurvival Analysis 2aSurvival Rate1 aPrentice, Ross0 tBiometrics.g2010 Mar., v. 66, no. 1 p.30-38dBlackwell Publishing Incx0006-341X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1541-0420.2009.01243.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02503naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245005900173300001300232520135500245592002801600650002101628650001701649650001201666650002301678650002201701650002201723650002501745650001601770650001601786650001401802650001501816700003001831700001901861700003501880773011201915856008102027852000902108655001202117IND60083135020221122234829.0141101e20110101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008313502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.abb.2010.08.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMouilleron, Stéphane10aDynamics of glucosamine-6-phosphate synthase catalysis  ap. 1-12.  aGlucosamine-6P synthase, which catalyzes glucosamine-6P synthesis from fructose-6P and glutamine, channels ammonia over 18Å between its glutaminase and synthase active sites. The crystal structures of the full-length Escherichia coli enzyme have been determined alone, in complex with the first bound substrate, fructose-6P, in the presence of fructose-6P and a glutamine analog, and in the presence of the glucosamine-6P product. These structures represent snapshots of reaction intermediates, and their comparison sheds light on the dynamics of catalysis. Upon fructose-6P binding, the C-terminal loop and the glutaminase domains get ordered, leading to the closure of the synthase site, the opening of the sugar ring and the formation of a “closed” ammonia channel. Then, glutamine binding leads to the closure of the Q-loop to protect the glutaminase site, the activation of the catalytic residues involved in glutamine hydrolysis, the swing of the side chain of Trp74, which allows the communication between the two active sites through an “open” channel, and the rotation of the glutaminase domains relative to the synthase domains dimer. Therefore, binding of the substrates at the appropriate reaction time is responsible for the formation and opening of the ammonia channel and for the activation of the enzyme glutaminase function.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aactive sites 3aammonia 3acatalytic activity 3acrystal structure 3aenzyme activation 3afructose 6-phosphate 3aglucosamine 3aglutaminase 3aglutamine 3ahydrolysis1 aBadet-Denisot, Marie-Ange1 aBadet, Bernard1 aGolinelli-Pimpaneau, Béatrice0 tArchives of biochemistry and biophysics.g2011 Jan. 1, v. 505, no. 1 p.1-12dElsevier Inc.x0003-98617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.abb.2010.08.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02335naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001700145245010600162300001600268520128500284592002801569650002101597650002401618650001801642650001601660650001401676650002001690650003401710650002101744650000901765650001601774700002301790773011501813856004801928852000901976655001201985IND4520862820221117084743.0151109e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND452086282DNAL7 a10.1007/s10924-011-0319-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTisserat, B.10aDegradation of Poly(L: -Lactic Acid) and Bio-Composites by Alkaline Medium Under Various Temperatures  ap. 766-775.  aRibbons of poly(lactic acid) (PLA) and PLA containing 10 or 25% Osage Orange (OO) biocomposites of various sized heartwood particles were exposed to non-composting soil conditions either outdoors or in a greenhouse. No appreciable degradation was evident after 208Â day treatments. An artificial alkaline degradation test system was developed to reduce the study time required to evaluate PLA compositional properties on degradation. Ribbons of PLA and PLA-OO biocomposites of various sized particles were subjected to hydrolysis in alkaline concentrations (0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.15, and 0.25Â M NaOH) under various temperatures (15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, and 80Â Â°C) up to 56Â days. Higher concentrations of NaOH (e.g., 0.25Â M) caused more dramatic and rapid deterioration of PLA and PLA-OO composites than lower NaOH concentrations for all temperatures tested. Incubation in either the low temperatures (15 and 20Â Â°C) or the highest temperature (80Â Â°C) was consistently more effective in PLA-OO degradation than employing 35 or 40Â Â°C. Several alkaline and temperature test combinations are offered to study accelerated PLA degradation. Ribbons immersed in NaOH were examined with the scanning electron microscope to analyze for morphological alterations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMaclura pomifera 3aalkaline hydrolysis 3abiocomposites 3agreenhouses 3aheartwood 3apolylactic acid 3ascanning electron microscopes 3asodium hydroxide 3asoil 3atemperature1 aFinkenstadt, V.

This poses a serious threat to efforts aimed to control onchocerciasis. This study attempts to determine factors associated with compliance to Community Directed Treatment with Ivermectin (CDTI) and provides a basis for trying to understand how best to sustain long-term compliance in order to achieve success in the control of onchocerciasis. METHODS: An unmatched case-control study was conducted in Bebeka coffee plantation southwest Ethiopia. Cases were, compliant i.e., those individuals who had been registered on the relevant treatment registers and had taken all the five annual doses of Ivermectin. Controls were non-compliant, i.e. those individuals who had been recorded in the relevant treatment registers during the first treatment round(2003), and did not take at least two doses of which one being in the last treatment round (2007). Data were collected using a pre-tested interviewer administered structured questionnaire. Data were edited, cleaned, coded and analyzed using SPSS version 12.0.1 for Microsoft Windows. Multiple logistic regression models was used to identify factors associated with compliance to ivermectin. RESULTS: From the total of 456 individuals selected for administration of the survey questionnaire, 450(225 cases and 225 controls) were contacted and completed the study 2 refused and 4 were unavailable. Five factors associated with compliance were identified: high risk perception [Adjusted Odds Ratio(AOR) = 1.98, 95% Confidence Interval (CI), 1.32-2.95], one's family support [AOR = 1.86, 95% CI, 1.22-2.84], perceiving that the Community Drug Distributors (CDDs) are doing their work well [AOR = 2.84, 95% CI, 1.50-5.37] and perceiving measuring height is the best way to determine a person's treatment dose [AOR = 6.37, 95% CI, 2.10-19.29] are positive predictors of compliance to ivermectin. CONCLUSION: Interventions to improve compliance in the area should focus on health education using epidemiological data in order to increase risk perception and dispelling misconceptions. Motivation and continued support to improve CDD's performance including training and incentives are crucial.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3ahealth education 3acase-control studies 3amotivation 3aonchocerciasis 3aivermectin 3adrug therapy 3aquestionnaires 3acompliance 3adisease control 3aconfidence interval 3aodds ratio 3aregression analysis 3afamily support 3arisk perception 3acommunity programs 3aEthiopia 0asurveys1 aDeribe, Kebede1 aWoldemichael, Kifle1 aWondafrash, Mekite1 aKassahun, Wondosen0 tParasites & vectors.g2010 Dec., v. 3, no. 1 p.176-176dSpringer-Verlagx1756-33057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1756-3305-3-48  aDNAL 7aarticle03278naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092024003200113040001800145100001800163245010300181300001800284500000900302520159800311592002801909650002301937650002401960650002001984650002102004650002302025650001802048650002102066650002802087650002402115650001802139650001902157650002502176650001102201650001302212650002602225650001602251650000902267650002502276650001602301650001502317651001202332700001802344700002102362773014002383852000902523856011202532856007902644961001302723655001202736IND4410022220221119224822.0191228e200809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441002222DNAL7 a10113/193622hdl7 a10.2136/sssaj2007.03142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReiter, M.

The resulting decreased N efficiency requires development of new N fertilizer recommendations. We conducted a replicated 3-yr field study on a Decatur silt loam (fine, kaolinitic, thermic Rhodic Paleudult) to determine the effects of N source (NHNO₃ [AN] and urea–NH₄NO₃ [320 g N kg⁻¹, UAN]), N rates (0, 45, 90, 135, and 180 kg N ha⁻¹), N application timing (all at-planting or 50:50 split between planting and first match head square), and N application method (banded or broadcast) on cotton grown in high-residue rye (Secale cereale L.) conservation systems. Generally, 67 to 80% more N was needed than average conventional N rate recommendations to reach optimal yields if N was split applied, while N applied at-planting had yield responses with 169% of the recommended N rate. Urea–NH₄NO₃ applications resulted in greater yields when banded at-planting (1045 kg lint ha⁻¹), while AN was more effective when broadcast applied at-planting or in split applications (1002 and 996 kg lint ha⁻¹, respectively). Chlorophyll meter readings, petiole NO₃, and leaf N were not useful predictors of cotton N deficiency or yield. The most efficient practice is to apply 88% more N (126 kg N ha⁻¹ total) than the mean conventional N cotton recommendation as a broadcast split application using AN. We speculate that N requirements may be decreased with time as C and N pools reach a new equilibrium.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapplication timing 3aapplication methods 3asilt loam soils 3aapplication rate 3aGossypium hirsutum 3afiber quality 3aammonium nitrate 3anutrient use efficiency 3anutrient management 3acrop residues 3aSecale cereale 3anitrogen fertilizers 3acotton 3anitrogen 3anutrient availability 3acover crops 3aurea 3aconservation tillage 3achlorophyll 3alint yield 3aAlabama1 aReeves, D.

For initial treatments we used fresh plant clippings from a species‐rich sandy grassland (Armerion elongatae) mowed at the end of July. Soil seed bank samples, taken at the beginning of the experiments and cultivated for 18 months, confirmed that the vegetation development on the slopes started with primary succession. Because seed rain is considered to be an important factor in primary succession, we also studied the diaspore input during the first year. The hospitable Quaternary substrate of Site I (pH = 4.1–4.7, 92 % sand) supports fast vegetation development on treated and untreated plots. On treated plots, we have identified plant assemblages similar to initial stages of the Armerion elongatae community. On control plots, Coryne‐phorion communities have established spontaneously. At Site II (mixed Quaternary and Tertiary substrate, pH = 3.0–3.5,40 % sand) the total cover and number of psammophytic species was low. Treated plots showed development towards ruderal sandy grassland, but the establishment of Calamagrostis epigejos would eventually lead to monodominant stands. Untreated control plots showed basically the same pattern, however the development was slower. At Site III (pH = 1.8–2.8, 34 % sand), the hostile Tertiary substrate impeded the succession on both treated and untreated plots because low pH and therefore high amounts of Al³⁺ produced elemental toxicity to plants. The application of plant clippings accelerated the vegetation development in sites with a pH exceeding 3. On plots with the initial treatment, vegetation cover and total number of species were higher than on untreated plots. The application of fresh plant clippings from areas with similar habitat conditions appears to be a viable alternative to traditional restoration methods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCalamagrostis epigejos 3aaluminum 3aburied seeds 3agrasslands 3ahabitats 3apH 3aprimary succession 3asand 3aseed dispersal 3atoxicity 3avegetation cover 3aGermany1 aMahn, Ernst‐Gerhard0 tApplied vegetation science.g2001 June, v. 4, no. 1 p.19-27dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1402-20017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1654-109X.2001.tb00230.x  aDNAL 7aarticle04949naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002800149245009600177300001200273500001500285520318800300592002803488650001803516650002903534650000903563650001003572650001603582650001003598650001003608650002903618650001603647650001203663650002203675650002003697650001103717650001803728650001003746650001103756650002503767650001103792650003203803650002503835650005203860650001203912650001103924650002503935650001703960650000803977650001003985651000903995651001004004653002704014700001504041700001604056700002304072700001904095773010504114856008304219852000904302655001204311IND60613968120221117181116.0180919e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061396812DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS-06-17-0892-PDN2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFernández-Tabanera, E.10aFirst Report of Onion yellow dwarf virus in Leek (Allium ampeloprasum var. porrum) in Spain  ap. 256.  a2019-12-06  aLeek (Allium ampeloprasum var. porrum) is one of the most important culinary plants in the world. Spain is the sixth European producer and the crop makes a considerable fraction of the total area of vegetable production (MAPAMA 2016). Leek is often affected by different viruses such as Iris yellow spot virus, Leek yellow stripe virus, and Shallot latent virus (Katis et al. 2012). Onion yellow dwarf virus (OYDV, genus Potyvirus) is one of the most widespread viruses in garlic and onion and affects the development and quality of the crops (Katis et al. 2012). OYDV causes mosaic and yellow streak striping in garlic leaves and in onion causes stem distortion, reduced number of flowers and seeds, and a loss of seed quality (Conci et al. 2003; Katis et al. 2012). However, OYDV has been found in leek only in Iran (Naderi Saffar et al. 2013), and had not been reported in leek in Spain. The aim of this study was to analyze the presence of this virus in leek crops from the northern half of Spain. In spring of 2015, 30 leek plants of four different varieties (Curling, Custeau, Megaton, and Pluston), showing symptoms of inverted roots and cracked stems, were collected from fields near San Pablo de la Moraleja, Valladolid (Castilla y León, Spain). Total RNA was extracted from 100 mg of leaf tissue of the 30 symptomatic field plants and healthy greenhouse plants (negative control) with the RNeasy Plant Mini kit (Qiagen, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. An RNA-DIG labeled probe, designed for the detection of a partial sequence of OYDV coat protein sequence (Ayllón et al. 2012), was used in a dot-blot assay. Nine out of the 30 analyzed symptomatic leek plants (30%) tested positive, while negative controls remained negative. To confirm the presence of OYDV, a two-step RT-PCR was performed using the same specific primers designed to amplify the region corresponding to the RNA probe (Ayllón et al. 2012). Amplicons of the expected size (234 bp) were obtained from the nine dot-blot positive samples and from another four plants; in total, 13 out of the 30 analyzed plants tested positive. OYDV was detected in leeks of all varieties analyzed. The presence of OYDV was not apparently related to the symptomatology observed in the leeks since it was not detected in all symptomatic samples, and no specific symptomatology of OYDV was observed in these plants. All RT-PCR products were purified with the gel extraction kit (Agilent) and their nucleotide sequence determined in both directions. The sequence of the amplicons, eliminating the primer regions, was identical in all 13 analyzed plants, and BLAST search indicated that it showed higher similarity to the Italian isolates (Parrano et al. 2012), with the highest (99%) identity to the Italian garlic isolate 218-OYDV6 (GenBank accession no. GQ475367.1) showing only one nucleotide difference. The presence of OYDV in leek plants in the field would represent an alternative host for the infection of onion and garlic crops, and could increase leek crop losses in mixed infections with other viruses. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the detection of OYDV in leek from Spain.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAllium porrum 3aLeek yellow stripe virus 3agels 3aroots 3agreenhouses 3astems 3aleeks 3aOnion yellow dwarf virus 3acrop losses 3aviruses 3aalternative hosts 3amixed infection 3aleaves 3acoat proteins 3aseeds 3agarlic 3aamino acid sequences 3aonions 3aIris yellow spot tospovirus 3aShallot latent virus 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3aflowers 3aspring 3anucleotide sequences 3aseed quality 3aRNA 3acrops 3aIran 3aSpain 0aIris yellow spot virus1 aFraile, A.1 aLunello, P.1 aGarcía-Arenal, F.1 aAyllón, M.

Energy and micronutrient intake was assessed in 63 students (n = 50 nutrition, and n = 13 occupation therapy degrees; n = 51 females, n = 12 males) using three 24-h dietary recalls. Energy requirements were calculated based on measured resting metabolic rate, estimated exercise energy expenditure, and dietary induced thermogenesis. Body composition was assessed using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry. Eating attitudes and cognitive restraint were measured using previously validated tools. Eighteen percent of nutrition students were classified as having low energy availability (<30 kcal kgFFM−1d−1) and 38% were in negative energy balance. Eating attitudes and cognitive restraint were not associated with total energy or macronutrient intake. However, female nutrition students with high cognitive restraint had greater exercise energy expenditure and thus lower energy availability than those with low cognitive restraint (371 (302) kcal d−1 compared to 145 (206) kcal d−1, P < 0.01, and 35 (7) kcal d−1 compared to 41 (10) kcal d−1 of fat free mass, P = 0.005). Additionally, in females, disordered eating attitudes and cognitive restraint negatively correlated with energy availability (rs = −0.37, P = 0.02 and rs = −0.51, P < 0.01 respectively). There were no differences in outcomes between nutrition and non-nutrition students. The current study suggests that those students with disordered eating attitudes and cognitive restraint may be controlling their energy balance through exercise, as opposed to restricting food intake.  aPublisher supplied data 3acognition 3acorrelation 3adiet recall 3adietary restriction 3adual-energy X-ray absorptiometry 3aeating disorders 3aenergy intake 3aenergy requirements 3aexercise 3afemales 3afood intake 3aheat production 3alean body mass 3amales 3aresting metabolic rate 3astudents 3atherapeutics 0aCognitive restraint 0aEating attitudes 0aEnergy availability 0aEnergy balance 0aEnergy intake1 aPelly, Fiona1 aSlater, Gary1 aMartin, Lisa Anne0 tAppetite.g2016 Dec. 01, v. 107 p.406-414dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl31756x0195-66637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2016.08.1053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03297naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002500149245011100174300001600285520179300301592002802094650002002122650001502142650001402157650002702171650000902198650001802207650001102225650001402236650001402250650001202264650002302276650001902299650002402318650000902342650001602351653002102367653001202388653001402400653001202414653000902426653000802435653000802443700007202451700002002523700001902543700001702562773009502579856008402674852000902758655001202767IND60558494020221120131847.0190401e20161201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055849402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.appet.2016.08.1082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchrempft, Stephanie10aMaternal characteristics associated with the obesogenic quality of the home environment in early childhood  ap. 392-397.  aThe home environment is likely to influence children's diet and activity patterns and ultimately, their weight trajectories. Identifying family characteristics associated with a more ‘obesogenic’ home can provide insight into the determinants, and has implications for targeting and tailoring strategies to promote healthier lifestyles. The present study examined maternal characteristics associated with a more obesogenic home environment in 1113 families with preschool children. Primary caregivers (99% mothers) from the Gemini cohort completed the Home Environment Interview (HEI) when their children were 4 years old. Maternal demographics and BMI were assessed in the Gemini baseline questionnaire when the children were on average 8 months old. Maternal eating style was assessed when the children were on average 2 years old, using the Dutch Eating Behaviour Questionnaire (DEBQ). Responses to the HEI were standardised and summed to create a composite score of the obesogenic quality of the home; this was categorised into tertiles. Multivariate ordinal logistic regression showed that mothers who were younger (adjusted OR; 95% CI = 0.96; 0.94–0.98), less educated (1.97; 1.40–2.77), and had lower incomes (1.89; 1.43–2.49) at baseline were more likely to live in an obesogenic home environment at 4 years, as were mothers who scored higher on the DEBQ External Eating scale (1.40; 1.16–1.70) at 2 years, and had a higher baseline BMI (1.05; 1.02–1.08). Using a novel, composite measure of the home environment, this study finds that families who are more socio-economically deprived, and where the mothers are themselves heavier and have a more food responsive eating style, tend to provide a home environment with the hallmarks of a higher risk of weight gain.  aPublisher supplied data 3abody mass index 3acaregivers 3achildhood 3ademographic statistics 3adiet 3aeating habits 3aincome 3aingestion 3alifestyle 3amothers 3apreschool children 3aquestionnaires 3aregression analysis 3arisk 3aweight gain 0aHome environment 0aObesity 0aChildhood 0aParents 0aDEBQ 0aHEI 0aSES1 avan Jaarsveld, Cornelia H.M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4269-00411 aFisher, Abigail1 aFildes, Alison1 aWardle, Jane0 tAppetite.g2016 Dec. 01, v. 107 p.392-397dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl31756x0195-66637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2016.08.1083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02888naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006300139245009300202300001800295500001400313500002000327520134200347592002801689596003201717650002701749650002101776650000901797650002501806650001901831650002601850650001001876650003101886650001101917650002101928650001801949650001101967650001101978700006301989700006202052700005802114700005802172773011802230856007302348852000902421655001202430IND60726358520221120032257.0210204e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072635852DNAL7 a10.1111/nph.170682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMalerba, Martino E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7480-477910aCell size influences inorganic carbon acquisition in artificially selected phytoplankton  ap. 2647-2659.  aNAL-light  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aCell size influences the rate at which phytoplankton assimilate dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), but it is unclear whether volume‐specific carbon uptake should be greater in smaller or larger cells. On the one hand, Fick’s Law predicts smaller cells to have a superior diffusive CO₂ supply. On the other, larger cells may have greater scope to invest metabolic energy to upregulate active transport per unit area through CO₂‐concentrating mechanisms (CCMs). Previous studies have focused on among‐species comparisons, which complicates disentangling the role of cell size from other covarying traits. In this study, we investigated the DIC assimilation of the green alga Dunaliella tertiolecta after using artificial selection to evolve a 9.3‐fold difference in cell volume. We compared CO₂ affinity, external carbonic anhydrase (CAₑₓₜ), isotopic signatures (δ¹³C) and growth among size‐selected lineages. Evolving cells to larger sizes led to an upregulation of CCMs that improved the DIC uptake of this species, with higher CO₂ affinity, higher CAₑₓₜ and higher δ¹³C. Larger cells also achieved faster growth and higher maximum biovolume densities. We showed that evolutionary shifts in cell size can alter the efficiency of DIC uptake systems to influence the fitness of a phytoplankton species.  aPublisher supplied data  cAustralian Research Council 3aDunaliella tertiolecta 3aactive transport 3aarea 3aartificial selection 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbonate dehydratase 3acells 3adissolved inorganic carbon 3aenergy 3ainorganic carbon 3aphytoplankton 3asupply 3avolume1 aMarshall, Dustin J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6651-62191 aPalacios, Maria M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5450-674X1 aRaven, John A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2789-32971 aBeardall, John1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7684-446X0 tnew phytologist.g2021 Mar., v. 229, no. 5 p.2647-2659dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44665x0028-646X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/nph.170683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03744naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005300139245014700192300001800339500001400357500002000371520135000391592002801741596006301769596006301832596006301895596006301958596008702021596008702108650002702195650001102222650001802233650001902251650001102270650001102281650001302292650002102305650001902326650001402345650001502359650001502374650001402389650000902403650001102412700005302423700006002476700005702536700001302593700005302606700005302659700005202712700005402764700005702818700005502875773011802930856007303048852000903121655001203130IND60726358920221120032236.0210204e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072635892DNAL7 a10.1111/nph.170412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Xin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5274-756610aCanopy processing of N deposition increases short‐term leaf N uptake and photosynthesis, but not long‐term N retention for aspen seedlings  ap. 2601-2610.  aNAL-light  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aForest canopies can retain nitrogen (N) from atmospheric deposition. However, most empirical and modeling studies do not consider the processing of the N deposited in the canopy. To assess whether N deposition through canopy will alter the plant’s N uptake and retention, we conducted a 3‐yr mesocosm experiment by applying (¹⁵NH₄)₂SO₄ solution to aspen sapling canopies or directly to the soil. We found that ¹⁵N‐NH₄⁺ applied to the canopy was directly taken up by leaves. Compared with the soil N application, the canopy N application resulted in higher photosynthesis but lower N retention of the plant–soil system in the first growing season. Plant biomass, N concentration, and leaf N resorption were not significantly different between the canopy and soil N applications. The partitioning of retained ¹⁵N among plant components and soil layers was similar between the two treatments 3 yr after the N application. Our findings indicated that the canopy N processing could alter leaf N supply and photosynthesis in the short term but not N retention in the long term. Under natural conditions, the chronic N deposition could continuously refill the canopy N pool, causing a sustained increase in canopy carbon uptake. Canopy N processing needs to be considered for accurately predicting the impact of N deposition.  aPublisher supplied data  a31600389cthe National Natural Science Foundation of China  a31670478cthe National Natural Science Foundation of China  a31988102cthe National Natural Science Foundation of China  a31522011cthe National Natural Science Foundation of China  a2020082cYouth Innovation Promotion Association of the Chinese Academy of Sciences  aXDA23080301cStrategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Science 3aatmospheric deposition 3acarbon 3aforest canopy 3agrowing season 3aleaves 3amodels 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3aphotosynthesis 3aphytomass 3aprediction 3aresorption 3aseedlings 3asoil 3asupply1 aWang, Bin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0893-05391 aWang, Chengzhang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6201-94691 aWang, Zhenhua1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1660-21131 aLi, Jing1 aJia, Zhou1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3309-13891 aYang, Sen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5452-944X1 aLi, Ping1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3883-94881 aWu, Yuntao1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6505-18511 aPan, Shengnan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0866-11161 aLiu, Lingli1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5696-31510 tnew phytologist.g2021 Mar., v. 229, no. 5 p.2601-2610dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44665x0028-646X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/nph.170413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04586naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001500149245009900164300001200263520305900275592002803334650001603362650002603378650002403404650002003428650001503448650001603463650000903479650001503488650001203503650001803515650001203533650001003545650001203555650001603567650001303583650001103596650003303607650001103640650001503651650001303666650002103679650001803700650003003718650001903748651002103767700001503788700001603803700001603819773010503835856008303940852000904023655001204032IND60613969520221120063137.0180919e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061396952DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS-06-17-0920-PDN2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCho, S. E.10aFirst Report of Powdery Mildew Caused by Podosphaera xanthii on Hydrocleys nymphoides in Korea  ap. 247.  aIn October 2013, Hydrocleys nymphoides (Willd.) Buchenau, known as waterpoppy, was found infected with a powdery mildew and lost its ornamental value with 100% infection. The waterpoppy was grown in a pot and placed in the window side of a building in Seoul, Korea. Powdery mildew colonies were circular to irregular or thinly effuse on the adaxial side of leaves. A voucher specimen was deposited in the Korea University Herbarium (KUS). Appressoria on the hyphae were nipple-shaped or nearly absent. Conidiophores were straight, 115 to 180 × 10 to 12.5 μm, and produced 2 to 5 immature conidia in chains with a crenate outline. Foot-cells of conidiophores were cylindric and 40 to 60 μm long. Conidia were ellipsoid-ovoid to barrel-shaped, measured 30 to 40 × 19 to 23 μm with a length/width ratio of 1.3 to 1.9, and had distinct fibrosin bodies. Primary conidia were apically conical or rounded, mostly truncate at base, and generally smaller than secondary conidia. Dark brown chasmothecia were found partly embedded in the mycelial felt on leaves, spherical, and 85 to 105 µm in diameter. Appendages were mycelioid, 1- to 4-septate, brown at the base and becoming paler upwards. Each chasmothecium contained a single ascus. Asci were sessile, broadly ellipsoid-ovoid to subglobose, 8-spored, and 53 to 70 × 50 to 60 μm. Ascospores were colorless, oval to subglobose, and 13 to 18 × 12 to 15 µm. These characteristics were consistent with those of Podosphaera xanthii (Castagne) U. Braun & Shishkoff (Braun and Cook 2012). To confirm the identification, internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions of KUS-F27719 were amplified with primers ITS5/P3 (Takamatsu et al. 2009) and sequenced directly. An NCBI BLAST search of the Korean isolate (GenBank accession no. MF402945) showed >99% similarity with sequences of P. xanthii isolates (KM505135, KP120972, KP329589, etc.). Pathogenicity was confirmed by dusting the conidia from a diseased leaf onto young leaves of three healthy waterpoppy plants. Three noninoculated plants were used as control. Plants were maintained in a greenhouse at 24 to 30°C. Inoculated leaves developed signs that were similar to those observed on diseased leaves after 8 days, whereas control plants remained healthy. There has been no previous record of powdery mildew on H. nymphoides (Farr and Rossman 2017). To our knowledge, this is the first report of powdery mildew caused by P. xanthii on H. nymphoides globally. We have visited several gardens and farms growing waterpoppies in Korea in 2014 to 2016 to find powdery mildews, but there was no occurrence. No powdery mildews have been recorded in Limnocharitaceae accommodating three genera, viz., Butomopsis, Hydrocleys, and Limnocharis (Amano 1986; Farr and Rossman 2017). Therefore, the waterpoppy powdery mildew in 2013 could be considered as an accidental occurrence. Since powdery mildew infection of waterpoppy detracted from the aesthetic value of the glossy leaves and caused early senescence of the leaves, continuous monitoring should be followed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA primers 3aHydrocleys nymphoides 3aPodosphaera xanthii 3aaesthetic value 3aappendages 3aappressoria 3aasci 3aascospores 3aconidia 3aconidiophores 3adusting 3afarms 3agardens 3agreenhouses 3aherbaria 3ahyphae 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3aleaves 3amonitoring 3amycelium 3aornamental value 3apathogenicity 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apowdery mildew 3aKorean Peninsula1 aHan, K.

The expression variations are critical for their activity variations, but how expression variations are generated is unknown. We identified genetic loci for gene expression variations through expression genome‐wide association study (eGWAS) and investigated their mechanisms through molecular analyses. We found that cis elements are the major determinants for expression variations of SAUR26, SAUR27, and SAUR28. Polymorphisms in the promoter region likely impact PIF4 regulation while those at the 3′UTR affect mRNA stability to generate variations in SAUR26 expression levels. These polymorphisms also differentially affect the mRNA stability of SAUR26 at two temperatures. This study reveals two mechanisms involving cis elements in generating gene expression diversity, which is likely important for local adaptations in Arabidopsis natural accessions.  aPublisher supplied data  a1353738cDivision of Integrative Organismal Systems  a1946174cDivision of Integrative Organismal Systems 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aarchitecture 3achemical elements 3agene expression 3agenes 3agenome-wide association study 3aloci 3apromoter regions 3atemperature1 aYang, Leiyun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1313-26301 aWu, Dianxing1 aZhang, Ning1 aHua, Jian1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3777-33440 tnew phytologist.g2021 Mar., v. 229, no. 5 p.2751-2764dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44665x0028-646X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/nph.170783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02905naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245014600171300001600317520134900333592002801682650002401710650001601734650001301750650001201763650001201775650002201787650002301809650002101832650001801853650002301871650000901894650001201903650001701915650001401932650001101946650001201957650001601969653001201985653001701997653001602014653001602030700002202046700002002068700001802088700002002106700002202126700001502148700001902163773007402182856008602256852000902342655001202351IND60558496220221123042028.0161115e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055849622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.peptides.2016.11.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKouno, Tetsuya10aReduced intake of carbohydrate prevents the development of obesity and impaired glucose metabolism in ghrelin O-acyltransferase knockout mice  ap. 145-152.  aA close relationship between acylated-ghrelin and sucrose intake has been reported. However, little has been examined about the physiological action of ghrelin on preference for different types of carbohydrate such as glucose, fructose, and starch. The current study was aimed to investigate the role of acylated-ghrelin in the determinants of the choice of carbohydrates, and pathogenesis of chronic disorders, including obesity and insulin resistance. In a two-bottle-drinking test, ghrelin O-acyltransferase (GOAT) knockout (KO) mice consumed a less amount of glucose and maltodextrin, and almost the same amount of fructose and saccharin solution compared to WT littermates. The increased consumption of glucose and maltodextrin was observed when acylated-ghrelin, but not unacylated-ghrelin, was exogeneously administered in normal C57BL/6J mice, suggesting an association of acylated-ghrelin with glucose-containing carbohydrate intake. When fed a diet rich in maltodextrin, starch and fat for 12 weeks, GOAT KO mice showed less food intake and weight gain, as well as improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity than WT mice. Our data suggests that blockade of GOAT activity may offer a therapeutic option for treatment of obesity and its associated metabolic syndrome by preventing from overconsumption of carbohydrate-rich food.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbohydrate intake 3afood intake 3afructose 3aghrelin 3aglucose 3aglucose tolerance 3ainsulin resistance 3aknockout mutants 3amaltodextrins 3ametabolic syndrome 3amice 3aobesity 3apathogenesis 3asaccharin 3astarch 3asucrose 3aweight gain 0aGhrelin 0aCarbohydrate 0aBody weight 0aFood intake1 aAkiyama, Nobuteru1 aFujieda, Kumiko1 aNanchi, Isamu1 aOkuda, Tomohiko1 aIwasaki, Takanori1 aOka, Shogo1 aYukioka, Hideo0 tPeptides.g2016 Dec., v. 86 p.145-152dElsevier Inc.x0196-97817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.peptides.2016.11.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05674naa a2200793 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001500149245012300164300001200287520358900299592002803888650002303916650002303939650001303962650000903975650001003984650000903994650002004003650001004023650001404033650001804047650002504065650001004090650001404100650001104114650001604125650001604141650001304157650003304170650002304203650001104226650001304237650000904250650001204259650001304271650001804284650001404302650001204316650001204328650001604340650001904356650001304375650001004388650002204398650000904420650001304429650001404442650001104456650001204467650001404479650001204493650001304505650002104518650001004539650001204549651001004561651001004571700001504581700001804596700005704614773010504671856008304776852000904859655001204868IND60613970620221121130949.0180919e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061397062DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS-07-17-0942-PDN2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVitale, S.10aFirst Report of Pythium myriotylum as a Causal Agent of Crown and Root Rot in Soilless Green Bean Cultivation in Italy  ap. 688.  aGreen beans are the unripe young fruit of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris). Italy is one of the larger European producers, together with Spain, of green beans with 140,000 t of fresh vegetable (FAOSTAT 2014). To increase green bean production and quality, its cultivation includes soilless growing. In the summer 2016, during a survey in a commercial greenhouse farm in central Italy (Latium region), over 200 out of 1,000 green bean plants (P. vulgaris cv. Valdarno) showed symptoms of crown and root rot followed by wilting. Plants were cultivated in a pot with sterile perlite and coconut fiber with no recycled-water irrigation system. The infected crowns and roots appeared water soaked with a cinnamon brown color, and dead plants occurred in distinct and well-delimited areas. Microbial isolations were performed from 10 diseased plants previously abundantly washed under running tap water. Fragments cut from the margin of subepidermal stem lesions were plated on P₅ARP (Jeffers and Martin 1986). A Pythium species was consistently isolated, and three single-hyphal cultures out of 25 colonies were transferred onto potato dextrose agar (PDA). Sporangia induced by soil filtrate were terminal or intercalary, filamentous, consisting of undifferentiated and inflated lobulate or digitate elements of variable length, mostly 7 to 17 µm in diameter. Oogonia mostly globose were terminal or intercalary from 20 to 35 µm in diameter (average 29 µm). Oospores were mostly aplerotic. On the basis of morphological features, the isolates were identified as Pythium myriotylum Drechsler (van der Plaats-Niterink 1981). The identity was confirmed by cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 (COI) and by internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequence comparison with 100 and 99% homology with HQ708745 and HQ643701, respectively. Both sequences were from a P. myriotylum Israeli (CBS 25470) isolate obtained from peanuts. The sequences of the three isolates AB290, AB291, and AB292 were deposited in GenBank with numbers LT882483, LT882484, and LT882485 and numbers MF374745, MF374746, and MF374747 for ITS and COI, respectively. Pathogenicity tests were conducted in the greenhouse on P. vulgaris cv. Valdarno plants at the 4 to 5 leaf stage. Five plants for each isolate were inoculated with a 3-mm mycelial plug cut from the margins of actively growing 6-day-old PDA cultures. Plugs were inserted at the collar level and wrapped with Parafilm. Two plants for each isolate were used as controls and treated as described above except that sterile PDA plugs replaced the inoculum. Inoculated plants were kept for 2 weeks under controlled conditions in a greenhouse at 25 ± 2°C. After that period all inoculated plants showed stem necrotic streaks extended downward to the crown and roots. Most of the plants eventually died, developing symptoms similar to those observed on plants naturally infected, thus fulfilling Koch’s postulates. Control plants remained symptomless. Colonies isolated from the lesions morphologically resembled the inoculated isolates. Pythium myriotylum is the causal agent of root rot in numerous economically important crops including peanuts, tomato, wheat, oats, cucumber, soya bean, tobacco, and maize (Wang et al. 2003). However, only one report described this pathogen on green bean in Europe, namely, in Spain (Serrano et al. 2007). To our knowledge, this is the first report of P. myriotylum on green bean plants in Italy. A more careful water management in soilless potting mix would avoid the emergence of Pythium root rot in this crop’s production system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhaseolus vulgaris 3aPythium myriotylum 3acinnamon 3acoir 3acolor 3acorn 3acrop production 3acrops 3acucumbers 3aculture media 3acytochrome-c oxidase 3afarms 3afiltrates 3afruits 3agreen beans 3agreenhouses 3ainoculum 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3airrigation systems 3aleaves 3amycelium 3aoats 3aoogonia 3aoospores 3apathogenicity 3apathogens 3apeanuts 3aperlite 3apotting mix 3arecycled water 3aroot rot 3aroots 3asequence analysis 3asoil 3asoybeans 3asporangia 3asummer 3asurveys 3atap water 3atobacco 3atomatoes 3awater management 3awheat 3awilting 3aItaly 3aSpain1 aLuongo, L.1 aMarinelli, E.1 aBelisario, A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8912-76380 tPlant disease.g2018 Mar., v. 102, no. 3 p.688-688dPlant DiseasewJournal:jnl30858x0191-29177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS-07-17-0942-PDN3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05542naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001400149245011100163300001200274520377900286592002804065650001304093650001904106650001404125650001904139650002504158650001704183650005004200650001904250650001604269650001604285650001504301650001004316650001204326650001804338650001104356650001004367650001004377650004504387650001104432650001904443650003304462650001304495650001304508650001504521650001404536650002404550650001304574650001704587650001004604651001604614700001504630700001604645700001604661700001404677700001604691773010504707856008304812852000904895655001204904IND60613970920221121074528.0180919e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061397092DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS-07-17-0958-PDN2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChang, T.10aFirst Report of Anthracnose of Persimmon (Diospyros kaki L. f.) Caused by Colletotrichum siamense in Korea  ap. 443.  aSweet persimmon (Diospyros kaki L. f.) is one of the most popular fruits in the world, owing to its fabulous taste. It is the most cultivated fruit crop in almost all the states of South Korea. Anthracnose of persimmon caused by Colletotrichum species results in both pre- and postharvest fruit decay with reduced yield and quality. The Colletotrichum species causing persimmon anthracnose reported from Korea include Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, C. acutatum, and C. horii (Kwon et al. 2011, 2013). In October 2015, persimmon fruits showing anthracnose disease symptoms were collected from an orchard in Cheongdo-gun, north Gyeongsang province, South Korea. The causal agents were isolated from the necrotic lesions. A small piece of necrotic tissue was cut from inside of the lesion of the diseased fruits, surface disinfected with 0.5% sodium hypochlorite solution for 2 min followed by rinsing with sterile distilled water, and placed onto Petri plates containing potato dextrose agar (PDA) amended with streptomycin (0.05 g/liter). Plates were incubated at 25°C for 4 days in the dark, and a pure culture was obtained by subculturing the hyphal tip of each isolate on fresh PDA plates. Seven-day-old colonies had white aerial mycelium with olivaceous gray mycelium below. The colonies were creamy white when observed from the reverse side. Hyphae were multinucleated and septate. Conidia were hyaline, cylindrical, straight or slightly curved, nonseptate, 12.3 to 18.6 × 3.9 to 6.6 μm (n = 25) (average 15.8 × 5.3 μm), and obtuse at both ends. Appressoria were ovate, globose, or ellipsoidal, 11.7 to 19.3 × 5.4 to 12.1 μm (n = 25) (average 14.5 × 7.6 μm), and dark brown in color. The morphological characteristics of the present isolate overlap with those of other species within the C. gloeosporioides complex including C. siamense (Weir et al. 2012). For accurate identification, the genomic DNA sequences were obtained from internal transcribed spacer (ITS), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), calmodulin (CAL), and the Apn2-Mat1-2 intergenic spacer and partial mating type (Mat1-2) gene (ApMat) genes and deposited in GenBank. A BLAST search (National Center for Biotechnology Information) of the resulting sequence of ITS (LC208833) showed 611/619 (99%) similarity with the sequence from C. gloeosporioides strain 16-412 (GenBank accession no. LC194223). GAPDH (LC208834) showed 280/280 (100%) similarity with the sequence from C. siamense strain Xt-18-1 (KM053171), and CAL (LC208835) showed 748/756 (99%) similarity with the sequence from C. siamense strain LF177 (KJ954645). Separation of C. siamense from other Colletotrichum species based on ITS is not reliable (Weir et al. 2012). Phylogenetic analysis using MEGA6, based on the GAPDH, CAL, and ApMat (LC307174) gene, showed that the present isolate clustered with the C. siamense strain, with high bootstrap support (>75%). Based on cultural characteristics and sequences similarity data, the current isolate associated with anthracnose disease of D. kaki was identified as C. siamense. Koch’s postulates were performed by spraying the conidial suspensions (10⁵ conidia/ml) on healthy and ripe fruits. Tiny (pin-headed) black spots were observed on the surface of the inoculated fruits after 3 to 5 days of inoculation. The fungus was successfully reisolated and identified as C. siamense according to the methods described above. C. siamense has been reported as a causal agent of anthracnose of Perseaamericana, Pistaciavera, Sarcandraglabra, Hymenocallis sp., Corchorus sp., Prunus persica, and Capsicum sp. (De Silva et al. 2017; Hu et al. 2015; Weir et al. 2012). To our knowledge, this is the first report of C. siamense causing anthracnose of persimmon in South Korea.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCapsicum 3aColletotrichum 3aCorchorus 3aDiospyros kaki 3aGlomerella cingulata 3aHymenocallis 3aNational Center for Biotechnology Information 3aPrunus persica 3aanthracnose 3aappressoria 3acalmodulin 3acolor 3aconidia 3aculture media 3afruits 3afungi 3agenes 3aglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 3ahyphae 3aintergenic DNA 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3amycelium 3aorchards 3apersimmons 3aphylogeny 3asodium hypochlorite 3aspraying 3astreptomycin 3ataste 3aSouth Korea1 aHassan, O.1 aJeon, J.

A.10aFirst Report of Lasiodiplodia theobromae Causing Branch Canker on ‘Manzanilla’ Olive in Northwestern Argentina  ap. 677.  aOlive is an economically important crop in Northwestern Argentina, where dead branches are frequently observed. In September of 2015 a total of 20 cankered branches and/or wood necrosis from 10 orchards showing dieback symptoms were collected from ‘Manzanilla’ olive trees in Catamarca (C) and La Rioja (LR) provinces. One cankered branch from each province was selected to study the dark brown internal tissue under the bark. Small pieces of symptomatic tissue were disinfected with 70% ethanol and 2% sodium hypochlorite, rinsed with sterile distilled water, aseptically transferred to 2% water agar (WA) plates, and incubated at 25°C under 12 h light-cycle period until fungal colonies developed. Pure culture of the fungus was obtained through successive transfers of hyphal tips from the margin of a growing colony onto WA plates, and then hyphal tips were transferred to 9-cm oatmeal agar (OA) plates to study morphological characteristics of the colony. Fungal colonies were fast growing and covered the plate surface after 4 days at 30°C in darkness. Colonies were dark blue to black, with abundant fluffy aerial mycelium and black underside. Grouped erumpent black pycnidia were observed after 15 days and measured 3 to 5 mm tall with conidia extruding in black masses. Conidiogenous cells were short and hyaline. Conidia were unicellular, hyaline, subovoid to ellipsoid, thick-walled with truncate base, and 25.94 (21 to 30) × 14.61 (12 to 15) µm (n = 40). Mature conidia were dark-walled, septate, with longitudinal striations, and 24.59 (22 to 32) × 13.88 (12 to 16) µm, and 22.54 (20 to 25) × 13.77 (13 to 15) µm (n = 40), with a length-to-width ratio of 1.77 and 1.64 for C and LR strains, respectively. Teleomorph was not observed in nature. Morphological traits agreed with descriptions of species within the Lasiodiplodia genus (Punithalingam 1976). To identify the isolates to species, the internal transcribed spacer ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 gene and part of the translation elongation factor (TEF1-α) and β-tubulin genes were amplified and sequenced using primers ITS1/ITS4, TEF1-α-688F/TEF1-α-986R, and Bet2a/Bet2b (Alves et al. 2008). ITS region (KY053847, KX816956), TEF gene (MF422024), and BET gene (MF628107) showed 100, 90, and 100% identity with L. theobromae isolates from ‘Mission’ and ‘Sevillano’ (JX515716, JX515717) and from Sevillano (JX515763, JX515685) olives from California, respectively (Úrbez-Torres et al. 2013). DNA sequences were deposited in GenBank. Two fungal isolates, one for each province, were used for pathogenicity tests. Isolates C and LR were grown on OA and incubated at 25°C under 12 h light for 7 days. Pathogenicity was verified on 10 healthy young ‘Arbequina’ olive plants. Three small wounds were made on the stem of each plant with a sterile needle. Mycelial plugs were placed on the wounded surface, covered with wet cotton, and kept under 100% relative humidity until symptom development. Noncolonized plugs were used as negative controls. Dark brown lesions were observed extending from the inoculation site reaching 3 cm after 30 days. Control plants showed no symptoms. Reisolation of the fungus from diseased parts showed the same morphological traits as the fungus isolated from the field. This fungus was previously described on olive trees in Italy (Carlucci et al. 2013) and California (Úrbez-Torres et al. 2013). This is the first report of L. theobromae on olive in Argentina.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aLasiodiplodia theobromae 3aOlea europaea 3aagar 3abark 3abranches 3aconidia 3adead wood 3adieback 3aethanol 3afungi 3agenes 3ahyphae 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3amycelium 3anecrosis 3aoatmeal 3aolives 3aorchards 3apathogenicity 3apeptide elongation factors 3apycnidia 3arelative humidity 3asodium hypochlorite 3ateleomorphs 3atranslation (genetics) 3atubulin 3awood 3aArgentina 3aCalifornia1 aNiz, J.1 aSalvador, R.1 aBerretta, M.1 aRoca, M.

R.10aFirst Report of Stem Rot on Potato Caused by Dickeya chrysanthemi in Minnesota  ap. 238.  aBacterial soft rot and black leg diseases of potato occur sporadically in the Upper Midwestern United States. Multiple members of the soft rot Enterobacteriaceae (SRE) cause diseases in potato. The taxonomy of SREs has undergone extensive revision, resulting in the establishment of new genera and species to better reflect the phylogeny and diversity of strains formerly classified as Erwinia carotovora or E. chrysanthemi (Marrero et al. 2013). One such species, Dickeya dianthicola, has been associated with recent severe black leg outbreaks in the eastern United States. To identify the SREs in the Upper Midwest, a 2016 survey of commercial and seed potato fields in Minnesota and North Dakota was conducted. SREs (123) were isolated from 78 tissue samples exhibiting symptoms of black leg, stem rot, and soft rot. Small tissue samples from the margin of symptomatic and healthy tissues were suspended in 0.02 M potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, for 30 min. Cell suspensions were serially diluted and spread onto crystal violet pectate (CVP) agar. Bacterial colonies producing pitting on CVP were subsequently reisolated on CVP and purified on nutrient broth yeast extract medium. Three isolates from one sample were obtained from a stem sample collected in Sherburne County, Minnesota. One isolate, SR64, was retained for phenotypic characterization and genetic identification. Symptoms associated with SR64 included dry, black-brown necrotic stem lesions with cracking and exposed vasculature. SR64 was determined to be gram negative based on reaction in 3% KOH. Growth on King’s B agar medium failed to produce fluorescence characteristic of Pseudomonas. SR64 also exhibited facultative anaerobic respiration in Hugh-Leifson medium and the ability to grow at 37°C on nutrient agar. Reinoculation of potato tuber slices with SR64 and incubation at 25°C for 2 days produced tissue maceration and dark ooze typical of SRE. DNA extracted from a pure culture of SR64 using DNeasy blood and tissue kits (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, U.S.A.) was used as template for genetic analysis. PCR was conducted using two primer sets: ADE1/ADE2 (Nassar et al. 1996) and Df/Dr (Laurila et al. 2010). SR64 template DNA produced 420 and 119 bp amplicons via ADE1/ADE2 and Df/Dr primers, respectively, as expected for Dickeya. The 16S rDNA was amplified using primer set F27/R1492 (Monciardini et al. 2002), and the ∼1.2 kb amplicon was sequenced and submitted for GenBank nucleotide BLAST analysis. SR64 shared 98% identity with that of the 16S rDNA sequence of type strain Dickeya chrysanthemi LMG 2804 (NZ_CM001974) (Samson et al. 2005). To confirm the species identification, additional housekeeping genes, dnaJ (DCH402_RS02710), dnaX (DCH402_RS15110), and gyrB (DCH402_RS00180) were amplified using primer sets reported by Marrero et al. (2013). Housekeeping gene sequences were concatenated creating a 1,955 bp fragment for analysis with CLC Main Workbench software (Qiagen). The pairwise percent identity between the concatenated sequences of SR64 and D. chrysanthemi LMG 2804ᵀ, D. zeae LMG 2505ᵀ, D. dianthicola LMG 2485ᵀ, D. dadantii subsp. dadantii LMG 25991ᵀ, and D. solani LMG 25993ᵀ was 99.13, 89.42, 90.85, 89.88, and 85.89%, respectively. The low incidence of Dickeya observed in this survey could be owing to limitations of the protocols used to isolate SREs. Alternatively, it could indicate that Dickeya is not currently prevalent in the region.

In May of 2017, a high incidence of foliar rust was observed throughout perennial ryegrass swards established at the campus of Nanjing Agricultural University and caused lesions covering 10% to nearly 100% of total leaf tissue. Uredinia pustules on infected leaves were brownish yellow to yellow and in linear streaks along host veins. Uredinia were orange and observed on the adaxial surface of the leaf blade at the early stages of disease, as the disease progressed, uredinia developed on the abaxial surface. Urediniospores were globose to broadly ellipsoid, had 4 to 7 scattered germ pores, and were 22.0 to 28.7 × 17.8 to 23.2 μm with a wall that was dark brown and 1.8 to 2.8 μm thick. No teliospores were observed. The morphology of urediniospores was similar to Puccinia coronata Corda described previously (Cummins 1971). The pustule phenotype on the infected leaves and host association with perennial ryegrass also indicated that the rust was caused by the fungus P. coronata (Smiley et al. 2005). Genomic DNA was extracted from a representative infected leaf of perennial ryegrass. The nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region was amplified by PCR with ITS4 and ITS5 (White et al. 1990). A 652-bp PCR product was sequenced and a BLAST analysis showed 99% similarity to P. coronata in the GenBank database (EU014044.1). Sequences have been deposited as accession MF434548. Pathogenicity was confirmed by spraying a suspension of urediniospores (1 × 10⁵ spores/ml) onto the foliage of 2-month-old healthy perennial ryegrass in four plastic pots (10 cm height × 10 cm top diameter × 6 cm bottom diameter). Two pots of noninoculated perennial ryegrass sprayed with sterile water served as controls. All pots were covered with plastic bags, transferred into a growth chamber with a 12-h day/night cycles at 24/22°C, and sprayed with water to encourage infection every other day. All inoculated perennial ryegrass developed typical symptoms of rust with orange uredinia after 10 days, and no symptoms developed on any of the controls. The pathogen was confirmed by resequencing the ITS region. P. coronata has been recorded on Poa sp. and Zoysia japonica in Jilin and Hainan, China (Liu et al. 2003; Liu and Pu 2004). To our knowledge, this is the first report of P. coronata on perennial ryegrass in Jiangsu, China. Given the highly susceptible response of perennial ryegrass in the field, it is necessary to develop effective measures for managing this rust disease in China.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDNA primers 3aLolium perenne 3aPoa 3aPuccinia coronata 3aZoysia japonica 3afungi 3agenetic databases 3agrowth chambers 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3alawns and turf 3aleaf blade 3aleaf rust 3apathogenicity 3apathogens 3aphenotype 3aplastic bags 3apolymerase chain reaction 3asequence analysis 3aspraying 3ateliospores 3aurediniospores 3awarm season 3aChina1 aYang, Neon,1 aLi, J.1 aGao, T.1 aRen, H.

However, straw is the main carbon source to soil and its removal reduces C input, affecting active fractions (dissolved organic carbon, DOC) and C storage. To quantify the effects of straw removal on DOC and C stocks, we built lysimeter system using soil (Rhodic Kandiudox) from sugarcane field. We evaluated four soil depths (1, 20, 50 and 100 cm) and four straw removal rates: no removal NR, medium MR, high HR and total TR, leaving 12, 6, 3 and 0 Mg/ha on the soil surface, respectively. After rainfall, drainage water was collected and analysed for DOC content. Soil C stocks were determined after the 17‐month. Total DOC released at 1‐cm depth amounted to 606, 500, 441 and 157 kg/ha in NR, MR, HR and TR, respectively. Net‐DOC suggests straw as the main source of DOC. Most of DOC in NR (50%) was retained within the 1–20 cm layer, resulting in higher C stock (10 Mg/ha) in the topsoil. In HR and MR, DOC retention was higher within 20–50 cm, suggesting differences in DOC composition. DOC in TR was 40% higher at 20 cm than at 1 cm, indicating C losses from topsoil. Low concentrations of DOC were found at 100‐cm depth, but representing 30% in TR. Straw removal for bioenergy production is sustainable, but we should leave at least 3 Mg/ha of straw to ensure DOC production and soil C storage, taking account the DOC contribution to key soil functions.  aPublisher supplied data  a2286cCoordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel  a17cCoordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel  cFundação Agrisus  a2018cSão Paulo Research Foundation  a09845‐7cSão Paulo Research Foundation  a03572cSão Paulo Research Foundation  a2016cSão Paulo Research Foundation  cFoundation for Research and Scientific and Technological Development of Maranhão  cNational Council of Technological and Scientific Development 3aKandiudox 3aadministrative management 3acarbon sequestration 3acarbon sinks 3adrainage water 3aethanol 3alysimeters 3arain 3astraw 3asugarcane 3atopsoil1 aKaiser, Klaus1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7376-443X1 aCherubin, Maurício Roberto1 aCerri, Carlos Eduardo Pellegrino1 aLisboa, Izaias Pinheiro1 aVasconcelos, Ana Luisa Soares1 aSiqueira‐Neto, Marcos0 tSoil use and management.g2021 Jan., v. 37, no. 1 p.126-137dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl36284x0266-00327nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/sum.126633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03483naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006300139245014500202300001400347500001900361500002000380520163400400592002802034596005702062596005702119596005502176650003002231650001902261650002102280650001902301650001702320650000902337650000902346650001202355650002802367650001802395650002702413650002202440650002502462650002402487650002102511650001702532650001502549650002302564651001302587700005702600700002102657700006002678773012102738856007302859852000902932655001202941IND60726361820221120203454.0210204e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072636182DNAL7 a10.1111/sum.126802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNishigaki, Tomohiro1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6669-803X10aCarbon dioxide flux and soil carbon stock as affected by crop residue management and soil texture in semi‐arid maize croplands in Tanzania  ap. 83-94.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aCrop residue management strategies must be adapted for improving carbon (C) balance and soil C stock in agroecosystems in sub‐Saharan Africa with consideration of the crop residue availability and site‐specific soil characteristics. We conducted field experiments to determine the effects of crop residue application method (incorporation/mulching) and quality (maize/cowpea) and N fertilizer application on the soil respiration rate and soil C stock in the surface soil layer (0–15 cm) in maize croplands with contrasting soil textures (clay/sandy) over 2 years from 2012 to 2014 in Tanzania. At the clay site, the incorporation of maize residues showed a 38% increase in CO₂ flux compared to mulching, whereas, at the sandy site, mulching showed a 16% increase compared to the incorporation. At the sandy site, mulching practice retained soil moisture content and apparently enhanced the decomposition of the original soil organic C in the surface layer. It is, therefore, suggested that mulching practice may accelerate a long‐term depletion of soil C stock at the sandy site. The cowpea residue incorporation led to rapid decomposition because of its high biodegradability at both sites. The N fertilizer application stimulated the decomposition of labile soil organic matter. The soil C stock in the surface layer did not significantly change after the 2‐year experiment, irrespective of crop residue treatment and soil type. In conclusion, adequate crop residue management in terms of suppressing CO₂ flux during a cropping season depends on soil type, but the long‐term effect on soil C stock is unclear.  aPublisher supplied data  a24228007cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science  a24255019cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science  a266313cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science 3aadministrative management 3aagroecosystems 3abiodegradability 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon sinks 3aclay 3acorn 3acowpeas 3acrop residue management 3acrop residues 3afertilizer application 3along term effects 3anitrogen fertilizers 3asoil organic carbon 3asoil respiration 3asoil texture 3asoil types 3asoil water content 3aTanzania1 aSugihara, Soh1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5874-89571 aKilasara, Method1 aFunakawa, Shinya1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2989-92350 tSoil use and management.g2021 Jan., v. 37, no. 1 p.83-94dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl36284x0266-00327nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/sum.126803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02733naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002700148245014600175300001600321520127100337592002801608650001601636650002101652650002301673650001401696650002201710650002101732650002801753650001401781650001601795650001901811651001101830653002201841653002201863653003601885653003801921653001301959653002501972700001701997700002502014773015602039856008302195852000902278655001202287IND60558499120221120131719.0190318e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055849912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.sajb.2016.11.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBhattacharyya, Paromik10aAssessment of genetic stability amongst micropropagated Ansellia africana, a vulnerable medicinal orchid species of Africa using SCoT markers  ap. 294-302.  aMicropropagation is an important tool for the conservation of threatened and commercially important plant species of which orchids deserve special attention. Ansellia africana is one such medicinally important orchid species having much commercial significance. However, for large-scale micropropagation to become not only successful but also acceptable by end-users, somaclonal variations occurring in the plantlets need to be eliminated. In the present study, the clonal integrity of micropropagated A. africana plants derived from two different pathways was assessed using a gene-targeted marker system, i.e. Start Codon Targeted polymorphism (SCoT). Our studies recorded a significantly higher gene flow value (Nm=1.596) amongst the generations with an increment in clonal variability. The developed protocol helps to understand the main start point of clonal variability in a model tissue culture system and the role played by the various plant growth regulators (PGRs). The protocol also documents a fast and cost-effective regeneration pathway for commercially important medicinal orchids with reproducible molecular detection system to monitor and detect clonal variability for obtaining clonally stable true-to-type plantlets for sustainable commercial use.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOrchidaceae 3aclonal variation 3acost effectiveness 3agene flow 3agenetic stability 3amicropropagation 3aplant growth substances 3aplantlets 3astart codon 3atissue culture 3aAfrica 0aAnsellia africana 0aGenetic stability 0aGene targeted molecular markers 0aMedicinal orchid micropropagation 0aSCoT-PCR 0aSomaclonal variation1 aKumar, Vijay1 aVan Staden, Johannes0 tSouth African journal of botany.g2017 Jan., v. 108 p.294-302dElsevier B.V.aSouth African Association of BotanistswJournal:jnl34108x0254-62997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sajb.2016.11.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03294naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245010300167300001600270520181000286592002802096650001902124650001102143650001302154650001902167650001602186650001102202650002302213650003502236650001502271650001302286650001302299650001402312650001002326650001402336650001902350650001702369650001502386650002402401650001702425650001202442650001802454651001102472651002302483700002102506700002302527700001802550773010502568856008202673852000902755655001202764IND60613972720221122030823.0180919e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061397272DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS-07-17-1014-RE2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAli, Emran Md.10aSensitivity of Phacidiopycnis spp. Isolates from Pome Fruit to Six Pre- and Postharvest Fungicides  ap. 533-539.  aPhacidiopycnis washingtonensis and P. pyri cause speck rot and Phacidiopycnis rot on apple and pear, respectively. Infection occurs in the orchard and remains latent, and symptoms appear after months of storage. Decay management relies on orchard sanitation and pre- and postharvest fungicides. In a 2017 survey, speck rot accounted for 6.4% of apple decay in central Washington, whereas Phacidiopycnis rot accounted for 3.9 and 6.7% of total pear decay in Washington and Oregon, respectively. Sensitivities of baseline populations of 110 P. washingtonensis and 76 P. pyri isolates collected between 2003 and 2005 to preharvest fungicides pyraclostrobin (PYRA) and boscalid (BOSC) and to postharvest fungicides thiabendazole (TBZ), fludioxonil (FDL), pyrimethanil (PYRI), and difenoconazole (DFC) were evaluated using a mycelial growth inhibition assay. Mean effective concentrations necessary to inhibit 50% growth (EC₅₀) of P. washingtonensis were 0.1, 0.3, 0.8, 1.8, 2.1, and 4.8 µg/ml for FDL, PYRI, TBZ, DFC, PYRA, and BOSC, respectively. Respective mean EC₅₀ values for P. pyri were 0.2, 0.6, 1.6, 1.1, 0.4, and 1.8 µg/ml. The sensitivity of exposed P. washingtonensis and P. pyri populations collected in 2017 revealed potential shifts toward BOSC and PYRA resistance. The efficacy of the six fungicides to control isolates of each pathogen with different in vitro sensitivity levels was evaluated on apple and pear fruit. FDL, DFC, and PYRI controlled both Phacidiopycnis spp. regardless of their EC₅₀ values after 5 months of storage at 0°C in a regular atmosphere. The consistent occurrence of Phacidiopycnis spp. will require continuous monitoring and development of disease management strategies based on fungicide phenotypes and efficacy of existing fungicides assessed herein.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhacidiopycnis 3aapples 3aboscalid 3adifenoconazole 3afludioxonil 3afruits 3agrowth retardation 3amedian effective concentration 3amonitoring 3amycelium 3aorchards 3apathogens 3apears 3aphenotype 3apyraclostrobin 3apyrimethanil 3asanitation 3astorage temperature 3astorage time 3asurveys 3athiabendazole 3aOregon 3aWashington (state)1 aPandit, Laxmi K.1 aMulvaney, Katie A.1 aAmiri, Achour0 tPlant disease.g2018 Mar., v. 102, no. 3 p.533-539dPlant DiseasewJournal:jnl30858x0191-29177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS-07-17-1014-RE3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04410naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100005700145245015300202300001600355500001400371500002000385520234100405592002802746596004002774596006102814596009002875596004902965596003603014596003403050650002303084650002003107650001803127650001703145650002203162650001503184650001903199650001403218650000903232651001303241700002403254700007003278700001903348700002503367700006303392700006503455700002603520700002803546700001903574700005703593773011803650856007903768852000903847655001203856IND60726363120221117024411.0210204e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072636312DNAL7 a10.1111/1365-2435.137102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPays, Olivier1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8268-180410aDisentangling the roles of bottom‐up and top‐down drivers in the trade‐off between food acquisition and safety in prey with multiple predators  ap. 435-449.  aNAL-light  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aPrey face a trade‐off between acquiring food and avoiding predation, but food availability, and therefore its effect, is rarely measured in field studies investigating non‐lethal effects of predation. The main aim of this study was to investigate the role of the presence of predators in the functional adjustments of feeding parameters with patch quality in a medium‐sized herbivore. In Hwange National Park (Zimbabwe), we set up an experiment by manipulating, over two years, patch quality for impala Aepyceros melampus, a medium‐sized herbivore. We assess predation risk by monitoring the presence of three GPS‐equipped predators: African lions Panthera leo, spotted hyaenas Crocuta crocuta and African wild dogs Lycaon pictus. In enriched, fertilised plots the impalas reduced step rates (i.e. the rates of change in feeding stations), and increased their number of bites per feeding station while bite rates were not affected. Thus, the main adjustment of their feeding was the step rate. The total time the impalas spent vigilant appeared to be a good predictor of the variation of their bite rate. Although vigilance caused a reduction in bite rate when at a feeding station, the impalas reduced the relative costs of vigilance by continuing chewing and processing their food when scanning for predators. When predators were in the vicinity, the impalas increased their exclusive vigilance (high‐cost vigilance) but not their vigilance while chewing (low‐cost vigilance) and decreased their bite rate while their step rate and the number of bites per feeding station did not change significantly. The impalas were thus visually disconnected from their patch, and reduced their bite rate when actually foraging. Exclusive vigilance increased when both lions and hyaenas were in the vicinity, and when wild dogs were nearby. Patterns of vigilance that altered bite rate were linked to the presence of predators during the previous 24 hr. Over the long term patch quality was the main determinant of the feeding parameters (step rate and bite rate). This study shows how predators, by affecting the time prey devote to predator detection, shape the functional adjustments of food acquisition by prey to local patch quality.

To achieve judicious applications of flusilazole, its hormetic effects on virulence of S. sclerotiorum were investigated. Flusilazole sprayed at concentrations from 0.02 to 0.5 μg/ml caused statistically significant (P < 0.05) stimulatory effects on virulence of S. sclerotiorum to potted rapeseed plants, and the maximum stimulation magnitudes were 11.0 and 10.7% for isolates GS-7 and HN-24, respectively. Studies on the time course of the infection process showed that a stimulatory effect on virulence could be discerned at 18 h postinoculation, indicating a direct stimulation mechanism rather than an overcompensation for initial inhibitions. In order to determine whether the stimulations were caused mainly by effects of flusilazole on S. sclerotiorum or on rapeseed plants, mycelia grown on flusilazole-amended potato dextrose agar (PDA) media were inoculated on leaves of rapeseed plants without spraying the fungicide. Mycelium radial growth on PDA supplemented with flusilazole at concentrations from 0.005 to 0.16 μg/ml was inhibited by 10.11 to 48.7% for isolate GS-7 and by 4.1 to 24.9% for isolate HN-24. Observations with a scanning electron microscope showed that flusilazole in PDA at 0.04 and 0.08 μg/ml caused slightly deformed mycelia and twisted mycelial tips. Nevertheless, after inoculating on leaves of potted rapeseed plants, virulence of the inhibited mycelia was statistically significantly (P < 0.05) greater than that of the nontreated control, and the maximum stimulation magnitudes were 16.2 and 19.8% for isolates GS-7 and HN-24, respectively. Studies on a physiological mechanism for virulence stimulations showed that tolerance to hydrogen peroxide did not increase significantly for mycelia grown on flusilazole-amended PDA, thus excluding the possibility of tolerance to reactive oxygen species as a potential mechanism for virulence stimulations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSclerotinia sclerotiorum 3aculture media 3ademethylation 3aflusilazole 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aleaves 3amycelium 3arapeseed 3ascanning electron microscopes 3aspraying 3avirulence1 aZhang, Ran1 aCong, Menglong1 aLi, Jianhong1 aZhu, Fuxing0 tPlant disease.g2018 Jan., v. 102, no. 1 p.197-201dPlant DiseasewJournal:jnl30858x0191-29177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS-07-17-1041-RE3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03795naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100006000145245009700205300001600302500001400318500002000332520235500352592002802707596004202735596004702777596003602824650002002860650001702880650001002897650002502907650002002932650002002952650002502972650001402997700005703011700002103068700002303089700002103112700002203133773011803155856007903273852000903352655001203361IND60726364020221117025201.0210204e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072636402DNAL7 a10.1111/1365-2435.137152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVernasco, Ben J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5561-727310aLongitudinal dynamics and behavioural correlates of telomeres in male wire‐tailed manakins  ap. 450-462.  aNAL-light  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBuilding on the predictions of state‐dependent life‐history theory, telomeres are hypothesized to either correlate with or function as an adaptive, proximate mediator of an individual's behaviour and life‐history strategy. To further understand the relationship between telomeres, behaviour and life‐history strategies, we measured male behaviour, telomere lengths and telomere dynamics in a free‐living population of known‐age, male wire‐tailed manakins Pipra filicauda. Male wire‐tailed manakins perform coordinated displays with other males at leks and these displays form the basis of long‐term coalition partnerships. Males exhibit consistent individual differences in the number of social partners within their social network and the frequency of social interactions. Male sociality is also positively correlated with both social rise and reproductive success. We measured male behaviour using a telemetry‐based, proximity datalogging system and blood telomere lengths were quantified using qPCR. We examined the relationships between telomere length, telomere dynamics, social status, and male behaviour. We also quantified the repeatability of telomere lengths, examined age‐related changes in telomere length, and tested for instances of telomere elongation that exceed residual error in telomere length. Telomere length was found to be highly repeatable. More social males exhibited shorter telomeres and higher rates of telomere attrition. Telomeres did not significantly vary with age within or between individuals in either of the male social classes. Two out of 25 individuals exhibited patterns telomere elongation that exceeded residual error in telomere measurements. Here we show that telomeres consistently vary between male wire‐tailed manakins and these differences are related to variation in male social behaviour. In this relatively long‐lived species, telomeres appear to be flexible traits that can increase or decrease in length. Overall, this study provides observational support for the hypothesis that telomeres act as a molecular marker that relates to behaviour in a state‐dependent manner. We also provide insight into the molecular consequences of individual variation in male social behaviour.

Processes that limit the performance of a pathogen thus occur at two scales: varying with both the availability of energy within a host, and the number of susceptible hosts in a patch. When the rate at which a host intakes and expends energy is density‐dependent, these two processes are intimately linked. By modifying how hosts compete for and expend resources, a shift in population density may contribute to differences in the flow of energy in a host–pathogen system, both in terms of the energy available for a host to grow, reproduce and fight infection, as well as the energy available for a pathogen to exploit. Energy flux, therefore, connects the two contrasting scales of within‐ and between‐host dynamics by directly linking the proliferation of a pathogen to the number of hosts circulating within a patch. We use the host Daphnia magna to explore the relationship between energy intake and expenditure at various population densities, as estimated by feeding and metabolic rates respectively. By infecting hosts with the bacterial pathogen Pasteuria ramosa, we then explore how infection changes the relative balance of energy intake and expenditure, and how this energy scope translates into production of transmission spores. Our work demonstrates that energy intake declines at a faster rate with density than does metabolic rate, leaving more excess energy (i.e. discretionary energy) available for both hosts and their dependent pathogens at low population densities. This energetic advantage translates positively into host and pathogen growth, with the production of mature transmission spores benefiting most from correlated changes in host body size, as well as a direct connection between energy scope and spore loads. Our findings reinforce how patch quality for a pathogen operates at two contrasting scales, with the within‐host proliferation of a pathogen being optimised in energy rich, low density host populations and opportunities for between‐host transmission likely maximised in dense populations.

Until today, most research has focused on temperate ecosystems and mineral soils while trampling effects on cold and organic matter‐rich tundra soils remain largely unknown. We aimed to develop a general model of trampling effects on soil structure, biota, microclimate and biogeochemical processes, with a particular focus on polar tundra soils. To reach this goal, we reviewed literature about the effects of trampling and physical disturbances on soils across biomes and used this to discuss the knowns and unknowns of trampling effects on tundra soils. We identified the following four pathways through which trampling affects soils: (a) soil compaction; (b) reductions in soil fauna and fungi; (c) rapid losses in vegetation biomass and cover; and (d) longer term shifts in vegetation community composition. We found that, in polar tundra, soil responses to trampling pathways 1 and 3 could be characterized by nonlinear dynamics and tundra‐specific context dependencies that we formulated into testable hypotheses. In conclusion, trampling may affect tundra soil significantly but many direct, interacting and cascading responses remain unknown. We call for research to advance the understanding of trampling effects on soils to support informed efforts to manage and predict the functioning of tundra systems under global changes.

This is particularly relevant because tropical forests play a prominent role in the nitrogen cycle and are becoming rapidly defaunated. Furthermore, frugivory is not considered in current plant‐large herbivore‐nutrient cycling frameworks exclusively focused on grazers and browsers. Here we used a long‐term replicated paired control‐exclusion experiment in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil, where peccaries and tapirs are the largest native frugivores, to examine the impact of large ground‐dwelling frugivores on modulating soil nitrogen cycling, considering their effects across a gradient of abundance of a hyper‐dominant palm. We found that both large frugivores and dominant palms play a substantial role in modulating ammonium availability and nitrification rates. Large frugivores increased ammonium by 95%, which also increased additively with palm abundance. Nitrification rates increased with palm abundance in the presence of large frugivores, but not on exclosure plots. Large frugivores also stimulated the regulation of the functions of soil‐nitrifying microorganisms, and modulated the landscape‐scale variance in nitrogen availability. Such joint effects of large frugivores and palms are consistent with the notion of ‘fruiting lawns’. Our study indicates that frugivory plays a pivotal role in zoogeochemistry in tropical forests by regulating and structuring the nitrogen cycle, urging to accommodate frugivory in plant‐large herbivore‐nutrient cycling frameworks. It also indicates that defaunation, deforestation and illegal palm and timber harvesting seriously affect nitrogen cycling in tropical forests, that play a prominent role in the global cycle of this nutrient.

On the other hand, foliar endophytes are often overlooked as a source of poor emergence or tree seedling disease. Here, we show that an endophytic fungus common to the foliar microbiome of Pinus ponderosa acts as a cryptic pathogen in delaying emergence. In a series of experiments, we inoculated seed of P. ponderosa with a suspension of Sydowia polyspora 12 h prior to sowing. S. polyspora reduced seed emergence of its host, P. ponderosa, by as much as 30%. A tetrazolium chloride viability assay showed that S. polyspora reduces emergence by preventing germination; seed remained viable. In sum, pathogens affecting tree seed emergence and seedling recruitment may be endophytic as well as in seed and soil and deserve greater attention in studies of natural regeneration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus ponderosa 3aSydowia polyspora 3aendophytes 3aforest nurseries 3afungi 3agermination 3amicrobiome 3anatural regeneration 3apathogens 3aseedlings 3asoil 3asowing 3aspecies recruitment 3atetrazolium 3atrees 3aviability assays1 aNewcombe, George0 tPlant disease.g2018 Mar., v. 102, no. 3 p.640-644dPlant DiseasewJournal:jnl30858x0191-29177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS-07-17-1074-RE3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03114naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245005400160300001600214500001900230500002000249520176600269592002802035596004702063596004702110596006902157596003402226650002502260650001802285650001802303650002302321650001402344650001302358650001402371650002102385650001302406700006402419773011402483856007302597961001302670852000902683655001202692IND60726366020221117025116.0210204e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072636602DNAL7 a10.1111/tpj.151122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFenn, Matthew A.10aPhytohormones in fruit development and maturation  ap. 446-458.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aPhytohormones are integral to the regulation of fruit development and maturation. This review expands upon current understanding of the relationship between hormone signaling and fruit development, emphasizing fleshy fruit and highlighting recent work in the model crop tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) and additional species. Fruit development comprises fruit set initiation, growth, and maturation and ripening. Fruit set transpires after fertilization and is associated with auxin and gibberellic acid (GA) signaling. Interaction between auxin and GAs, as well as other phytohormones, is mediated by auxin‐responsive Aux/IAA and ARF proteins. Fruit growth consists of cell division and expansion, the former shown to be influenced by auxin signaling. While regulation of cell expansion is less thoroughly understood, evidence indicates synergistic regulation via both auxin and GAs, with input from additional hormones. Fruit maturation, a transitional phase that precipitates ripening, occurs when auxin and GA levels subside with a concurrent rise in abscisic acid (ABA) and ethylene. During fruit ripening, ethylene plays a clear role in climacteric fruits, whereas non‐climacteric ripening is generally associated with ABA. Recent evidence indicates varying requirements for both hormones within both ripening physiologies, suggesting rebalancing and specification of roles for common regulators rather than reliance upon one. Numerous recent discoveries pertaining to the molecular basis of hormonal activity and crosstalk are discussed, while we also note that many questions remain such as the molecular basis of additional hormonal activities, the role of epigenome changes, and how prior discoveries translate to the plethora of angiosperm species.  aPublisher supplied data  aIO2‐1855585cNational Science Foundation  aIOS‐1339287cNational Science Foundation  a2019‐67013‐29098cNational Institute of Food and Agriculture  cAgricultural Research Service 3aSolanum lycopersicum 3aabscisic acid 3acell division 3aclimacteric fruits 3aepigenome 3aethylene 3afruit set 3agibberellic acid 3atomatoes1 aGiovannoni, James J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0972-25150 tplant journal.g2021 Jan., v. 105, no. 2 p.446-458dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl47643x0960-74127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/tpj.151123Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02950naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006000139245012400199300001600323500001900339500002000358520164100378592002802019596005702047596002402104596002002128650001602148650002102164650001502185650001502200650001602215650002902231650002902260700002002289700005902309773011402368856007302482852000902555655001202564IND60726366120221117024445.0210204e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072636612DNAL7 a10.1111/tpj.149962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFavero, David S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6879-032310aMolecular pathways regulating elongation of aerial plant organs: a focus on light, the circadian clock, and temperature  ap. 392-420.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aOrgans such as hypocotyls and petioles rapidly elongate in response to shade and temperature cues, contributing to adaptive responses that improve plant fitness. Growth plasticity in these organs is achieved through a complex network of molecular signals. Besides conveying information from the environment, this signaling network also transduces internal signals, such as those associated with the circadian clock. A number of studies performed in Arabidopsis hypocotyls, and to a lesser degree in petioles, have been informative for understanding the signaling networks that regulate elongation of aerial plant organs. In particular, substantial progress has been made towards understanding the molecular mechanisms that regulate responses to light, the circadian clock, and temperature. Signals derived from these three stimuli converge on the BAP module, a set of three different types of transcription factors that interdependently promote gene transcription and growth. Additional key positive regulators of growth that are also affected by environmental cues include the CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENIC 1 (COP1) and SUPPRESSOR OF PHYA‐105 (SPA) E3 ubiquitin ligase proteins. In this review we summarize the key signaling pathways that regulate the growth of hypocotyls and petioles, focusing specifically on molecular mechanisms important for transducing signals derived from light, the circadian clock, and temperature. While it is clear that similarities abound between the signaling networks at play in these two organs, there are also important differences between the mechanisms regulating growth in hypocotyls and petioles.  aPublisher supplied data  a20H03284cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science  cUniversity of Tokyo  a15H05961cRIKEN 3aArabidopsis 3acircadian clocks 3ahypocotyls 3aplasticity 3atemperature 3atranscription (genetics) 3aubiquitin-protein ligase1 aLambolez, Alice1 aSugimoto, Keiko1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9209-82300 tplant journal.g2021 Jan., v. 105, no. 2 p.392-420dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl47643x0960-74127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/tpj.149963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02831naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002500152245013300177300001600310520117700326592002801503650001801531650001701549650001701566650000901583650002601592650002701618650001301645650001301658650002801671650001901699653001401718653001901732653002501751653001301776653002401789653001701813700003101830700001601861700002201877700002801899700002301927700001901950700002501969700002001994700002102014700002602035700002102061773011102082856008702193852000902280655001202289IND60558501620221122141801.0190318e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055850162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2016.10.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLechevalier, Valerie10aPasteurisation of liquid whole egg: Optimal heat treatments in relation to its functional, nutritional and allergenic properties  ap. 137-149.  aPasteurised liquid egg products represent around 70% of total egg products. Pasteurisation, necessary for microbiological safety, is a unit operation undergone by the totality of liquid whole egg commercialized. The present work aims to investigate the impact of a wide range of pasteurisation rates (among those classically used in industry) on the interfacial properties, in vitro digestibility and antigenicity of whole egg proteins, in order to optimize the unit operation parameters to ensure all whole egg qualities. Pasteurisation from 4 to 10 min at 60 °C improved protein interfacial properties, in vitro digestibility and decreased ovomucoïd antigenicity but did not significantly change ovotransferrin and lysozyme antigenicity. On the opposite, pasteurisation from 4 to 10 min at 66 °C decreased protein in vitro digestibility and increased drastically ovotransferrin antigenicity. Pasteurisation from 4 to 10 min at 60 °C enabled to reach all whole egg properties, but for safety reasons, higher pasteurisation rates at 62 or 64 °C are good compromises to ensure microbiological safety without excessively damaging the functional properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aallergenicity 3aegg products 3aegg proteins 3aeggs 3afunctional properties 3ain vitro digestibility 3aindustry 3alysozyme 3amicrobiological quality 3apasteurization 0aWhole egg 0aPasteurisation 0aInterfacial property 0aEmulsion 0aIn vitro digestion 0aAntigenicity1 aGuérin-Dubiard, Catherine1 aAnton, Marc1 aBeaumal, Valérie1 aDavid Briand, Elisabeth1 aGillard, Angelique1 aLe Gouar, Yann1 aMusikaphun, Nuttinee1 aTanguy, Gaëlle1 aPasco, Maryvonne1 aDupont, D.q(Didier),1 aNau, Françoise,0 tJournal of food engineering.g2017 Feb., v. 195 p.137-149dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34294x0260-87747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2016.10.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02416naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245011500168300001600283520113100299592002801430650001901458650002201477650001901499650000801518650001601526650001301542650002201555650001101577650001301588650001001601650001601611650001401627650001701641650005201658651001101710700002001721700001801741700002701759773010501786856008201891852000901973655001201982IND60613975420221120115614.0180919e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061397542DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS-07-17-1104-RE2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChirkov, Sergei10aAnalysis of Genetic Diversity of Russian Sour Cherry Plum pox virus Isolates Provides Evidence of a New Strain  ap. 569-575.  aPlum pox virus (PPV) exists as a complex of nine strains adapted to different Prunus hosts. Unusual PPV isolates that do not belong to the known cherry-adapted strains were discovered on sour cherry in Russia. Here, two complete genomes of isolates Tat-2 and Tat-4 were determined by sequencing on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform. Both were composed of 9,792 nucleotides, excluding the poly(A) tail, with the organization typical of PPV and had 99.4 and 99.7% identity between each other at the nucleotide and amino acid levels. The sequence identities between Tat-2/Tat-4 and known PPV strains ranged from 77.6 to 83.3% for genomic RNA and from 80.0 to 93.8% for polyprotein. Phylogenetic analysis placed Tat-2 and Tat-4 in a separate clade, distinct from the C and CR strains. Three more Tat-2/Tat-4-like isolates were detected in local cherry plantings using the newly developed, specific RT-PCR assay. Based on the phylogenetic analysis, sequence identities, and environmental distribution, Tat-2, Tat-4, and related isolates represent a new cherry-adapted PPV strain for which the name PPV-CV (Cherry Volga) is proposed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPlum pox virus 3aPrunus cerasifera 3aPrunus cerasus 3aRNA 3aamino acids 3acherries 3agenetic variation 3agenome 3agenomics 3ahosts 3anucleotides 3aphylogeny 3apolyproteins 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3aRussia1 aSheveleva, Anna1 aIvanov, Peter1 aZakubanskiy, Alexander0 tPlant disease.g2018 Mar., v. 102, no. 3 p.569-575dPlant DiseasewJournal:jnl30858x0191-29177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS-07-17-1104-RE3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05391naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001300149245009200162520364000254592002803894650001303922650001203935650003403947650001303981650001303994650001004007650001204017650001804029650001404047650002004061650002204081650001304103650002004116650001004136650001304146650003304159650001204192650001404204650001104218650001004229650000904239650001504248650001204263650001304275650000904288650001804297650001404315650001504329650001404344650001704358650001704375650001304392650001804405650001004423651001004433700001304443700001104456700001604467700001204483700001604495773010204511856008304613852000904696655001204705IND60613975720221120110326.0180919e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061397572DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS-07-17-1108-PDN2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Y.10aFirst Report of Dipsacus asperoides Leaf Spots Caused by Septoria scabiosicola in China  aDipsacus asperoides belonging to Dipsacaceae is an herbaceous perennial plant. The roots of the plant have been used in traditional Chinese medicine to nourish the liver and kidneys and to strengthen and modulate local metabolism for bones and muscles for thousands of years (Committee of China Pharmacopoeia 2005). In a disease survey conducted in Gansu and Hubei in 2016, brown spots on the leaves were observed on D. asperoides. The leaf disease incidence was 45 to 65% and averaged 50 to 150 tiny spots on a leaf. The disease initially appeared on the leaves as numerous small, circular or irregular dark brown spots and later enlarged to 2 to 3 mm lesions with white centers and purple or dark brown broad margins. The pycnidial conidiomata is immersed or semi-immersed on white centers of the lesions, one to a few in each leaf spot, globose to subglobose, brown to dark brown, 75 to 87.5 × 72.5 to 87.5 µm in diameter; ostiole single, initially 12.5 to 15 µm wide (mean, 13.5 µm), later becoming irregular and up to 40 µm wide; conidia hyaline, filiform, straight or slightly curved, with three to six septate, containing several minute oil droplets or granulars that are beside the septates. The size range of conidia was 25 to 47.5 × 1.3 to 2.5 µm (mean, 35.7 × 2.5 µm). The pathogen of the D. asperoides leaf spots was isolated from the diseased tissues on potato dextrose agar (PDA) medium. The colonies of the isolate grew to 4 to 6 mm in diameter in 2 weeks on PDA, margin irregular, conidial slime honey colored, dark pycnidial conidiomata densely aggregated, and aerial mycelium scanty, consisting of minute white tufts. To test the pathogenicity of the pathogen (isolate TCM-18) an experiment was conducted using 10 healthy D. asperoides plants. The conidia suspension was obtained from 20-day-old cultures on PDA using 10 ml of 0.1% Tween-80, and the concentration was adjusted to 1 × 10⁴ conidia/ml using a hemocytometer. Eight plants were inoculated using 10 ml of the conidial solution. Two plants were used as controls and sprayed with the same volume of 1 µl of Tween-80 and distilled water. The 10 plants were covered with plastic bags and sprayed using distilled water to maintain high humidity. After this, they were put in a chamber at 20°C for 72 h, and bags were removed and the pathogen was reisolated from lesions after 10 days. Inoculated plants had tan-colored necrotic spots on the leaf, whereas the control plants did not have any symptoms. The DNA of isolate TCM-18 was extracted using the FastDNAkit (SK1375) (Sangon Biotech, Shanghai, China) and four loci: ITS, LSU, RPB2, and TUB were amplified and sequenced with primers ITS1/ITS4, LROR/LR5, fRPB2-5F/fRPB2-7Cr, and T1/β-Sandy-R, respectively (Verkley et al. 2013). Then, the 514, 797, 1,160, and 437-bp segments were obtained and submitted to GenBank with accession numbers MF540881, MF540882, MF540880, and MF540879, respectively. The neighbor-joining analysis method was used to construct the phylogeny tree of the combined multi locus database through Mega 6.0. The isolate TCM-18 clustered with several strains of Septoria scabiosicola with 100% maximum support. The morphological characteristics and phylogenetic data support that the pathogen of D. asperoides leaf spot can be identified as S. scabiosicola. S. scabiosicola causes leaf spots of the plants in Scabiosa and Knautia belonging to Dipsacaceae (Bai 2003). This is the first report of S. scabiosicola causing D. asperoides leaf spots in China. The pathogen identification of Dipsacus causing leaf spots supplies scientific knowledge for the control of the disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDipsacus 3aKnautia 3aOriental traditional medicine 3aScabiosa 3aSeptoria 3abones 3aconidia 3aculture media 3adatabases 3adisease control 3adisease incidence 3adroplets 3afoliar diseases 3ahoney 3ahumidity 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3akidneys 3aleaf spot 3aleaves 3aliver 3aloci 3ametabolism 3amuscles 3amycelium 3aoils 3apathogenicity 3apathogens 3aperennials 3aphylogeny 3aplastic bags 3apolysorbates 3apycnidia 3aribosomal DNA 3aroots 3aChina1 aJing, L.1 aDu, T.1 aZeng, C.

The NCLDV group includes the families Poxviridae, Asfarviridae, Iridoviridae, Ascoviridae, Phycodnaviridae, Mimiviridae and the proposed family "Marseilleviridae". The family Mimiviridae includes the largest known viruses, with genomes in excess of one megabase, whereas the genome size in the other NCLDV families varies from 100 to 400 kilobase pairs. Most of the NCLDVs replicate in the cytoplasm of infected cells, within so-called virus factories. The NCLDVs share a common ancient origin, as demonstrated by evolutionary reconstructions that trace approximately 50 genes encoding key proteins involved in viral replication and virion formation to the last common ancestor of all these viruses. Taken together, these characteristics lead us to propose assigning an official taxonomic rank to the NCLDVs as the order "Megavirales", in reference to the large size of the virions and genomes of these viruses.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAscoviridae 3aAsfarviridae 3aIridoviridae 3aPhycodnaviridae 3aPoxviridae 3acytoplasm 3agenes 3anew order 3aproteins 3avirion 3avirus replication 3aviruses 2aDNA Virusesxclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aDNA, Viralxgenetics 2aEukaryotaxvirology 2aEvolution, Molecular 2aTerminology as Topic1 aDe Lamballerie, Xavier1 aYutin, Natalya1 aAsgari, Sassan1 aBigot, Yves1 aBideshi, Dennis K.1 aCheng, Xiao-Wen1 aFederici, Brian A.1 aVan Etten, James L.1 aKoonin, Eugene V.1 aLa Scola, Bernard1 aRaoult, Didier0 tArchives of virology.g2013 Dec., v. 158, no. 12 p.2517-2521dSpringer-Verlagx0304-86087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00705-013-1768-6  aDNAL 7aarticle03043naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245017000171300001400341520150400355592002801859650001301887650001301900650001101913650001201924650001201936650001301948650001301961650002401974650001101998650001002009650001802019650000902037650001402046650001702060650002002077650001102097653001302108653000902121653001302130653001302143653001202156653001902168700001602187700002502203700002202228700005802250773010902308856008702417852000902504655001202513IND60558502520221122141759.0190318e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055850252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2016.11.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMagens, Ole M.10aAdhesion and cleaning of foods with complex structure: Effect of oil content and fluoropolymer coating characteristics on the detachment of cake from baking surfaces  ap. 48-59.  aThe effect of surface coating on the detachment of a complex microstructured food material, was investigated using an improved version of the millimanipulation device described by Ali et al. (2015 Food & Bioproducts Processing, Vol. 93, 256–268). The test material was baked sponge cake batter, which contains approximately 27 vol% bubbles in a ‘continuous’ phase of emulsified oil in a flour/syrup suspension. Detachment in the dry state was studied for aluminium, 304 stainless steel and seven different fluoropolymer coatings. The surfaces differed in surface energy and roughness. The shear force required to detach baked cake, the work done, and the mass of residue remaining on the surface were measured. Virtually all samples detached by cohesive or mixed failure, where adhesion to the surface was stronger than or comparable with cohesive interactions within the cake. The shear force was almost independent of surface composition, energy and roughness, but strongly related to the oil content of the cake. The mass of residue was found to be linearly dependent on the calculated work of adhesion of oil to the surface in an aqueous environment. The quantitative findings are consistent with confocal microscopy images of uncooked batter contacting polar and non-polar surfaces which show very different oil spreading behaviour at the batter-substrate interface. The ability of oil to replace water from a surface is shown to be a key factor determining adhesion of these materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3aaluminum 3abaking 3abatters 3abubbles 3acleaning 3acoatings 3aconfocal microscopy 3aenergy 3aflour 3alipid content 3aoils 3aroughness 3asponge cakes 3astainless steel 3asyrups 0aAdhesion 0aCake 0aCleaning 0aCohesion 0aFouling 0aSurface energy1 aLiu, Yingda1 aHofmans, Jurgen F.A.1 aNelissen, Joke A.1 aIan Wilson, D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3950-91650 tJournal of food engineering.g2017 Mar., v. 197 p.48-59dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34294x0260-87747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2016.11.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03045naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100006300152245007200215300001400287520153900301592002801840650001901868650001701887650001501904650002001919650001901939650001201958650000801970650001801978650001201996650001502008650001502023650001302038650002302051653001702074653002402091653002502115653002802140653002102168653002902189700001902218700002102237700003202258700002302290700002102313773010902334856008702443852000902530655001202539IND60558502620221122141739.0190318e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055850262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2016.11.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarcía, Míriam R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9538-638810aSmart sensor to predict retail fresh fish quality under ice storage  ap. 87-97.  aFish wastage and market prices highly depend on accurate and reliable predictions of product shelf life and quality. The Quality Index Method (QIM) and EU grading criteria for whitefish (Council Regulation(EC) No 2406/96, 1996) are established sensory methods used in the market to monitor fish quality. Each assessment requires the consultation of a panel of trained experts. The indexes refer exclusively to the current state of the fish without any predictions about its evolution in the following days.This work proposes the development of a smart quality sensor which enables to measure quality and to predict its progress through time. The sensor combines information of biochemical and microbial spoilage indexes with dynamic models to predict quality in terms of the QIM and EU grading criteria. Besides, the sensor can account for the variability inside the batch if spoilage indexes are measured in more than one fish sample.The sensor is designed and tested to measure quality in fresh cod (Gadus morhua) under commercial ice storage conditions. Only two spoilage indexes, psychrotrophic counts and total volatile base-nitrogen content, were required to get accurate estimations of the two usual established sensory methods. The sensor is able to account for biological variability as shown with the validation and demonstration data sets. Moreover, new research and technologies are in course to make these measurements faster and non-destructive. This would allow having at hand a smart non-intrusive fish quality sensor.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3aGadus morhua 3acod (fish) 3adata collection 3adynamic models 3aexperts 3aice 3amarket prices 3amarkets 3aprediction 3ashelf life 3aspoilage 3astorage conditions 0aSmart sensor 0aRetail fish quality 0aQuality index method 0aPredictive microbiology 0aCore predictions 0aFish-to-fish variability1 aCabo, Marta L.1 aHerrera, Juan R.1 aRamilo-Fernández, Graciela1 aAlonso, Antonio A.1 aBalsa-Canto, Eva0 tJournal of food engineering.g2017 Mar., v. 197 p.87-97dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34294x0260-87747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2016.11.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03115naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002600144245015600170300001600326520161600342592002801958650002601986650002502012650001902037650001802056650001602074650001302090650000902103650001602112650001302128650002802141650001702169650001402186650001602200650001402216650002602230653001602256653001602272653001402288653001602302653001402318700002002332700002002352700001902372700002202391773010802413856007902521852000902600655001202609IND60726368220221117024937.0210903e20210101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072636822DNAL7 a10.2478/aoas-2020-00512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJagiełło, Krzysztof10aProduction of triploid, doubled haploid (DH) and meiogynogenetic brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) – efficiency and development of body deformities  ap. 141-157.  aIn the present research we produced triploid, mitogynogenetic (doubled haploid; DH) and meiogynogenetic brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) to examine efficiency of these technologies and potential susceptibility of chromosome set manipulated individuals for the spinal disorders. Triploidy was induced by shocking (High Hydrostatic Pressure – HHP) of fertilized eggs 30 min. after insemination. In turn, gynogenetic development was induced by activation of eggs with UV-irradiated sperm. Activated eggs were then exposed to HHP shock applied 30 and 420 minutes after insemination to provide meiogynogenotes and gynogenetic DHs, respectively. When compared to non-manipulated diploids, the highest survival rates were observed among triploid brook trout while DHs showed the highest mortality. Malformation rates in the diploid larvae from the control groups did not exceed 7.0% while percentage of malformed triploid individuals equaled 19.1%. Drastically increased number of deformed larvae (> 30%) was observed in both DH and meiogynogenetic individuals. Intensification of kyphosis and scoliosis was clearly demonstrated in the gynogenetic and triploid brook trout. Genetic factors such as increased number of sets of chromosomes in triploids and expression of lethal alleles in the gynogenetic fish plus side effects of HHP shock utilized for retention of the second polar body or inhibition of the first cell cleavage when induced triploid and gynogenetic development have been discussed to affect survival rates and prevalence for the skeletal deformities in the chromosome set manipulated brook trout.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalvelinus fontinalis 3aabnormal development 3aanimal science 3acell cleavage 3achromosomes 3adiploidy 3afish 3agynogenesis 3ahaploidy 3ahigh pressure treatment 3ainsemination 3ascoliosis 3aspermatozoa 3atriploidy 3aultraviolet radiation 0abrook trout 0agynogenesis 0atriploids 0adeformities 0ascoliosis1 aPolonis, Marcin1 aPanasiak, Ligia1 aDobosz, Stefan1 aOcalewicz, Konrad0 tAnnals of animal science.g2021 Jan. 01, v. 21, no. 1 p.141-157dSciendowJournal:2194x2300-87337nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2478/aoas-2020-00513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02943naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245010500171300001600276520147900292592002801771650002101799650001801820650002301838650001101861650001101872650001701883650002601900650001101926650001401937650001101951650001301962650002501975650001302000650001302013651001002026653002002036653002302056653001302079653001402092653001202106653001902118700002402137700002502161700002302186700002402209773009802233856008502331852000902416655001202425IND60558503120221122174935.0190318e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055850312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cropro.2016.10.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVarikou, Kyriaki10aRefreshing bait spots in an olive orchard for the control of Bactrocera oleae (Diptera: Tephritidae)  ap. 153-159.  aKey to the success of the ground bait spray application method (‘attract and kill’) against Bactrocera oleae (Gmelin) is the long-term maintenance of the attractiveness of the trophic attractant as well as the toxicity of the active ingredient included in a bait spot. Large-scale field trials were conducted in olive orchards on Crete to estimate the quantity of alpha-cypermethrin applied as a bait spot on olive leaves as well as lab experiments to evaluate its residual effectiveness against the fly over time. Alpha-cypermethrin remained effective in olive tree canopies for at least 2 months (residues of alpha-cypermethrin on olive leaves were detected 7 days after the first and second bait spray applications and ranged from 5 to 7 and 16 to 19 mg/kg, respectively, as indicated by GC-MS/MS analysis, while the recorded adult mortality was >55% for at least 20 weeks following spray application). Moreover, additional protein-only sprays to specific parts of the olive canopy that had been previously sprayed with a bait spraying solution (alpha-cypermethrin plus hydrolysed protein at 75% w/w) significantly reduced olive fruit fly captures in treated plots compared to the captures recorded in plots with the classical bait spray. The percentages of live infestation of B. oleae were very low (<2%) and did not differ significantly between the two tested practices. The benefits of the reduced use of pesticides in the management of this pest are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBactrocera oleae 3aOlea europaea 3aactive ingredients 3aadults 3acanopy 3acypermethrin 3afield experimentation 3aleaves 3amortality 3aolives 3aorchards 3aprotein hydrolysates 3aspraying 3atoxicity 3aCrete 0aOlive fruit fly 0aAlpha-cypermethrin 0aResidues 0aBait spot 0aProtein 0aAttractiveness1 aGarantonakis, Nikos1 aBirouraki, Athanasia1 aGkilpathi, Dimitra1 aKapogia, Emmanouela0 tCrop protection.g2017 Feb., v. 92 p.153-159dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34114x0261-21947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cropro.2016.10.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02883naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002200144245014600166300001600312520141700328592002801745650003401773650001901807650001201826650001301838650002201851650001601873650001101889650001301900650001201913650001601925650002201941650001301963650001201976651001101988653002301999653001202022653001502034653002402049700001602073700002302089700002902112700003002141700002202171773010802193856007902301852000902380655001202389IND60726368620221117024701.0210903e20210101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072636862DNAL7 a10.2478/aoas-2020-00562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAntos, Aleksandra10aIs contamination of bovine-sourced material with bovine viral diarrhea virus still a problem in countries with ongoing eradication campaigns?  ap. 173-192.  aIn this report, we describe the detection of bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) contamination in commercial animal-derived sera and vaccines against animal viral pathogens on the market in Poland. Antibodies against BVDV were detected in 4/45 sera samples (8.9%) using an ELISA test. The presence of BVDV antigen was found using ELISA in 3/45 serum samples (6.6%) and 18/172 vaccine samples (10.5%). An RT -PCR was conducted using primers targeting two genome regions, the five prime untranslated region (5’UTR) and N-terminal protease (Nᵖʳᵒ). BVDV RNA was detected in 33/45 (73.3%) of sera, and 11/172 samples (6.4%) of collected vaccines, of which one vaccine did not declare BVDV strain in its composition. A single serum showed the presence of an infectious virus and only one was contaminated with all 3 species of BVDV. The most frequent species in sera was BVDV-3 (75.5%), whereas in vaccines only BVDV-1 was identified. Sequence analysis showed that the tested commercial sera and one vaccine were contaminated by six genotypes of BVDV: -1a, -1b, -1c, -1d, -2a, and -3. Identification of BVDV and its genetic material in animal-derived products is important due to the possibility of pestivirus transmission as well as the chance of falsifying the results of a diagnostic test. It also demonstrates the necessity of rigorous monitoring of the bioproducts used at the laboratory and industry level.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBovine viral diarrhea virus 1 3aanimal science 3aanimals 3aantigens 3abiobased products 3ablood serum 3agenome 3aindustry 3amarkets 3aproteinases 3asequence analysis 3avaccines 3aviruses 3aPoland 0afetal bovine serum 0avaccine 0apestivirus 0aviral contamination1 aRola, Jerzy1 aBednarski, Michał1 aKrzysiak, Michał Konrad1 aKęsik-Maliszewska, Julia1 aLarska, Magdalena0 tAnnals of animal science.g2021 Jan. 01, v. 21, no. 1 p.173-192dSciendowJournal:2194x2300-87337nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2478/aoas-2020-00563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05415naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100005700149245019500206300001200401520355400413592002803967650003203995650004004027650001604067650002804083650002404111650002004135650003304155650001104188650002204199650001804221650002204239650001304261650001004274650001104284650002204295650002204317650001404339650002504353650001004378650001104388650003004399650001604429650001304445650003004458650001804488650002204506650001004528651000904538700002404547700002004571700001304591773010504604856008304709961001204792852000904804655001204813IND60613977220221121044813.0180919e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061397722DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS-08-17-1154-PDN2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFlower, C.

Onset of symptoms was rapid and widespread, occurring in late July 2016 and affecting ∼60 trees across two elm research plantations. Symptoms included a general yellowing of individual tree canopies, epinasty of foliage throughout the canopy, phloem discoloration, and on a subset of trees, a strong odor of methyl salicylate (observed in phloem tissue extracted from the lower stem). Similar symptoms in elms have been attributed to the classic elm yellows ‘Candidatus Phytoplasma ulmi’ (16SrV-A) (Lee et al. 2004) and the Illinois elm yellows phytoplasma (16SrVI-C) (Jacobs et al. 2003). In July 2016, samples were collected from 12 symptomatic and 8 asymptomatic American elm trees. DNA from the leaf midrib and branch phloem was isolated and analyzed for phytoplasma via seminested polymerase chain reactions (PCR). PCRs were first primed by phytoplasma universal primer pair P5/P7 (Jomantiene et al. 1998), followed by P7 and the reverse complement of the universal phytoplasma primer R16R2 for amplification of the phytoplasma 16S-23 ribosomal (r) DNA (16S-23 rRNA gene) sequences as per Gundersen and Lee (1996). The predicted band size of the second PCR product is 487 base pair (bp). The product bands were isolated, purified, and sequenced using primer P7. Sequencing results of the PCR products indicated that nine of the symptomatic and one of the asymptomatic American elm trees tested were infected by a phytoplasma. A BLAST search of the DNA sequences indicated high similarities to members of the ‘Ca. P. trifolii’ group 16SrVI-A. The sequences of all 10 phytoplasma-infected trees were identical to each other. To further confirm that a strain of ‘Ca. P. trifolii’ was infecting the elms, a PCR product was cloned and sequenced. The 1,557 bp band was the product of primers P1a/P7, followed by PCR primers designed from the sequence of ‘Ca. P. trifolii’. This band was cloned into the pMiniT 2.0 vector. Plasmid sequencing used standard sequencing primers (SP6 and T7 promoters), the primers included with the vector, and finally, custom designed phytoplasma primers that eliminate other bacterial DNA from getting amplified. The entire plasmid clone was sequenced in both directions with four to six times of coverage per base. Determination of the phytoplasma classification group was based on the nucleotide sequence within the phytoplasma universal primers F2n/R2 PCR fragment within the 16Sr gene. Using iPhyClassifier, the online tool for phytoplasma classification and taxonomic assignment (https://plantpathology.ba.ars.usda.gov/cgi-bin/resource/iphyclassifier.cgi), the sequence similarity between the Delaware elm phytoplasma and ‘Ca. P. trifolii’ (GenBank accession no. AB279597.1) is 99.9% in the 16Sr region, which places the Delaware elm phytoplasma in the 16SrVI-A group. The sequence of the plasmid was deposited in GenBank under accession number MF385584. Elm decline and yellows diseases in North America have been associated with the Illinois elm yellows phytoplasma (16SrVI-C, GenBank accession no. AF268893.1) (Jacobs et al. 2003), ‘Ca. Phytoplasma ulmi’ (16SrV-A) (Lee et al. 2004), and phytoplasma in the aster yellows group (16SrI-C) (Lee et al. 1995).  aPublisher supplied data 3a16SrI (Aster yellows group) 3a16SrVI (Clover proliferation group) 3aDNA primers 3aElm yellows phytoplasma 3aUSDA Forest Service 3aUlmus americana 3abacterial diseases of plants 3acanopy 3acomputer software 3adiscoloration 3adisease outbreaks 3aepinasty 3agenes 3aleaves 3amethyl salicylate 3amolecular cloning 3amortality 3anucleotide sequences 3aodors 3aphloem 3aplant pathogenic bacteria 3aplantations 3aplasmids 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aribosomal RNA 3asequence homology 3atrees 3aOhio1 aHayes-Plazolles, N.1 aSlavicek, J.

The high expression of AQPs has been described in the digestive system, where large-scale absorption and secretion of fluids occurs. AQPs are also present in the nervous system, but the majority of studies have involved the central nervous system.

The Pt NPs–CGR–NF nanocomposites with excellent conductivity, catalysis, and biocompatibility offered an extremely hydrophilic surface for AChE adhesion. Chitosan (CS) was used as cross-linker to immobilize the AChE on Pt–CGR–NF-modified GCE. NF was used as a protective membrane of the AChE biosensors. The AChE biosensor showed favorable affinity to acetylthiocholine chloride (ATCl) and could catalyze the hydrolysis of ATCl with an apparent Michaelis–Menten constant value of 148μM. Under optimum conditions, the biosensor detected methyl parathion in the linear range from 1.0×10⁻¹³ to 1×10⁻¹⁰M and from 1.0×10⁻¹⁰ to 1×10⁻⁸M with a detection limit of 5×10⁻¹⁴M and detected carbofuran in the linear range from 1.0×10⁻¹² to 1×10⁻¹⁰M and from 1.0×10⁻¹⁰ to 1×10⁻⁸M with a detection limit of 5×10⁻¹³M. The biosensor exhibited good sensitivity, acceptable stability, and reproducibility, thus providing a promising tool for analysis of enzyme inhibitors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetylcholinesterase 3aadhesion 3abiocompatibility 3abiosensors 3acarbofuran 3acatalytic activity 3achitosan 3adetection limit 3aenzyme inhibitors 3aenzyme kinetics 3aglassy carbon electrode 3agraphene 3ahydrolysis 3ahydrophilicity 3ananocomposites 3ananoparticles 3aparathion-methyl 3aplatinum1 aWang, Guangcan1 aLiu, Yongjun0 tAnalytical biochemistry.g2013 June 15, v. 437, no. 2 p.144-149dElsevier Inc.x0003-26977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ab.2013.03.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02694naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002000146245014500166300001300311520139200324592002801716650001901744650001501763650001601778650001701794650002801811650002101839650001501860650002201875650001301897650003101910650001301941700002301954700002001977700002701997700002202024700002002046700002102066773009602087856008002183852000902263655001202272IND60083114120221118213134.0141101e20130701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008311412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ab.2013.03.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWalrant, Astrid10aDirect translocation of cell-penetrating peptides in liposomes: A combined mass spectrometry quantification and fluorescence detection study  ap. 1-10.  aCell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) can cross cell membranes in a receptor-independent manner. Two main routes for their cellular uptake have been proposed: endocytosis and direct translocation through the cell membrane. The ability of a peptide to enter cells through direct translocation can be assessed by evaluating the amount of peptide crossing the membrane of liposomes. Most methods reported so far rely on the use of fluorescent probes, which, when attached to a CPP, often alter its physical/chemical properties. Herein, a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight MS-based method is described to quantify the amount of CPP taken up into lipid vesicles and to distinguish it from the amount that is bound or inserted in the membrane. For comparison, visualization of the uptake of the same, but fluorophore-labeled, peptides into giant vesicles and cells by fluorescence microscopy is also reported. We show that membrane charge density is an important factor for direct translocation. We also show that fluorophore-labeled peptides have a different translocation behavior and that they are more toxic to cells. Alternative methods to fluorescence, such as the one reported herein, should be favored when investigating the uptake mechanism of CPPs, as fluorescent dyes can alter short peptides’ physical/chemical properties and their internalization capacities.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell membranes 3adesorption 3aendocytosis 3afluorescence 3afluorescence microscopy 3afluorescent dyes 3aionization 3amass spectrometry 3apeptides 3aphysicochemical properties 3atoxicity1 aMatheron, Lucrèce1 aCribier, Sophie1 aChaignepain, Stéphane1 aJobin, Marie-Lise1 aSagan, Sandrine1 aAlves, Isabel D.0 tAnalytical biochemistry.g2013 July 1, v. 438, no. 1 p.1-10dElsevier Inc.x0003-26977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ab.2013.03.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02025naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001700146245007600163300001400239520097500253592002801228650002401256650002101280650001001301650001701311650001101328650001301339650001701352650002201369650002501391650001501416700002201431700002401453773009701477856008001574852000901654655001201663IND60083114920221118213529.0141101e20130701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008311492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ab.2013.03.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGoel, Neelam12aA comparative analysis of soft computing techniques for gene prediction  ap. 14-21.  aThe rapid growth of genomic sequence data for both human and nonhuman species has made analyzing these sequences, especially predicting genes in them, very important and is currently the focus of many research efforts. Beside its scientific interest in the molecular biology and genomics community, gene prediction is of considerable importance in human health and medicine. A variety of gene prediction techniques have been developed for eukaryotes over the past few years. This article reviews and analyzes the application of certain soft computing techniques in gene prediction. First, the problem of gene prediction and its challenges are described. These are followed by different soft computing techniques along with their application to gene prediction. In addition, a comparative analysis of different soft computing techniques for gene prediction is given. Finally some limitations of the current research activities and future research directions are provided.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputer techniques 3aeukaryotic cells 3agenes 3ahuman health 3ahumans 3amedicine 3ametagenomics 3amolecular biology 3anucleotide sequences 3aprediction1 aSingh, Shailendra1 aAseri, Trilok Chand0 tAnalytical biochemistry.g2013 July 1, v. 438, no. 1 p.14-21dElsevier Inc.x0003-26977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ab.2013.03.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02237naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002200146245011300168300001400281520128700295592002801582650003101610650001301641650002201654650001701676650001401693650001601707650002601723773009701749856008001846852000901926655001201935IND60083115420221120022229.0141101e20130701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008311542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ab.2013.03.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWinzor, Donald J.13aAn analytical solution to the characterization of antigen–antibody interactions by kinetic exclusion assay  ap. 42-46.  aA simpler derivation of the basic expression for the dependence of fluorimetric response ratio (RAg/Rₒ) on free antigen concentration has demonstrated the universal invalidity of the analysis that is incorporated into the manufacturer’s software for determining immunoaffinities by kinetic exclusion assay, and traced the error to inadequate allowance for antibody bivalence in the solution phase of the assay. An analytical solution to the quantitative characterization of antigen–antibody interactions from the dependence of RAg/Rₒ on total antigen concentration is also described, thereby eliminating the necessity for the extensive simulative procedures employed in current determinations of dissociation constants by kinetic exclusion assay. In the illustrative application of this analytical approach to published results on the interaction between a metal chelate (cadmium–ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, Cd–EDTA) and an elicited monoclonal antibody, the analytical processing of the data has been performed on a calculator. However, there is no need to replace the more sophisticated procedure that is incorporated into the Sapidyne software provided that programming changes are made to rectify the erroneous equation on which the simulative analysis is based.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantigen-antibody reactions 3aantigens 3acomputer software 3adissociation 3aequations 3afluorometry 3amonoclonal antibodies0 tAnalytical biochemistry.g2013 July 1, v. 438, no. 1 p.42-46dElsevier Inc.x0003-26977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ab.2013.03.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02431naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002000146245011000166300001400276520114500290592002801435650002801463650001201491650001601503650001101519650001901530650001901549650002001568650001501588650001001603650002601613650001501639650001601654650001701670650002001687700001501707700001901722700001901741700002001760700001901780773009701799856008001896852000901976655001201985IND60083115520221120022230.0141101e20130701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008311552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ab.2013.03.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeinert, Sabine10aQuantitative quenching evaluation and direct intracellular metabolite analysis in Penicillium chrysogenum  ap. 47-52.  aSustained progress in metabolic engineering methodologies has stimulated new efforts toward optimizing fungal production strains such as through metabolite analysis of Penicillium chrysogenum industrial-scale processes. Accurate intracellular metabolite quantification requires sampling procedures that rapidly stop metabolism (quenching) and avoid metabolite loss via the cell membrane (leakage). When sampling protocols are validated, the quenching efficiency is generally not quantitatively assessed. For fungal metabolomics, quantitative biomass separation using centrifugation is a further challenge. In this study, P. chrysogenum intracellular metabolites were quantified directly from biomass extracts using automated sampling and fast filtration. A master/slave bioreactor concept was applied to provide industrial production conditions. Metabolic activity during sampling was monitored by ¹³C tracing. Enzyme activities were efficiently stopped and metabolite leakage was absent. This work provides a reliable method for P. chrysogenum metabolomics and will be an essential base for metabolic engineering of industrial processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPenicillium chrysogenum 3abiomass 3abioreactors 3acarbon 3acell membranes 3acentrifugation 3aenzyme activity 3afiltration 3afungi 3ametabolic engineering 3ametabolism 3ametabolites 3ametabolomics 3astable isotopes1 aRapp, Sina1 aSchmitz, Katja1 aNoack, Stephan1 aKornfeld, Georg1 aHardiman, Timo0 tAnalytical biochemistry.g2013 July 1, v. 438, no. 1 p.47-52dElsevier Inc.x0003-26977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ab.2013.03.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02479naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245009400163300001600257520143100273592002801704650001001732650001401742650001701756650001101773650001301784650001101797650002001808650001501828650002501843650001401868650000901882700002001891773011501911852000902026856008202035655001202117IND4419319120221118013141.0190314e200904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441931912DNAL7 a10.1007/s10086-008-1008-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNordvik, Enar10aLooking at computer-visualized interior wood: A qualitative assessment using focus groups  ap. 113-120.  aThe objective of this study was to explore and gather human reactions and perceptions on computer visualizations of interior wood. The subjective qualities of such products are important because they infl uence the most critical of consumer decisions: to buy or not. To learn more about a phenomenon than quantitative data can provide, qualitative methods are needed. Here, grounded theory was used with focus groups to form a map of 14 people’s experiences of wood. Six computer-generated pictures with visible wood were varied into 18 pictures, such that two-by-two comparison resulted in 3500 words. These were combined into a map that was generated earlier, which had found 2000 words. The main dimensions found were light, color, unity, and authenticity. Light is more than brightness; shadows and lighting seemed more important for the wood feeling, and color and contrast gave life and warmth to the material on the screen. Respondents wanted wood that was more “woody” and “warmer” than wood actually is, that is, a hyper-realistic picture. Perhaps smart modification rather than photorealism should be the goal. Distribution of the earlier found activity and harmony was important for most respondents. In addition, many subjects discussed the composition and/or the context or purpose of the pictures. The impact of wood is not just related to the wood itself; it is also intertwined with its surroundings.  aPublisher supplied data 3acolor 3acomputers 3afocus groups 3ahumans 3alighting 3apeople 3aproduct quality 3apurchasing 3aqualitative analysis 3ascreening 3awood1 aBroman, N.

The smolts were the offspring of three river populations. They were individually tagged, transferred to cages in a small bay where estuarine salinity gradients had been established and released on four dates from mid‐May to early June after either 3 or 7 days of acclimatisation. The previously mature male parr (PMMP) were smaller than their siblings before release, but performed much better during their time in the sea. As grilse, they reached sizes comparable with the formerly immature fish, and their recapture rate was more than four times higher (8.6 vs 2.1%). This difference decreased somewhat during the following years because 0.85% of the immature fish and only 0.1% of PMMP were recaptured as multi‐sea‐winter salmon. The highly successful marine performance of the PMMP demonstrated that this life history strategy may be more flexible than previously believed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalmo salar 3aacclimation 3aanimal growth 3acages 3afreshwater fish 3alife history 3amaturity stage 3amortality 3aparr 3aprogeny 3arivers 3asalinity 3asalmon 3asiblings 3asmolts 3aNorway1 aHOLM, M.0 tFisheries management and ecology.g2011 Oct., v. 18, no. 5 p.384-391dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0969-997X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2400.2011.00792.x  aDNAL 7aarticle03246naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004100092040001800133100001700151245010500168300001800273520217000291592002802461650001202489650001102501650001202512650001502524650001802539650001102557650002302568650001902591650001102610650001802621700001902639700001502658773011502673856008702788852000902875655001202884IND4469169720221118013100.0150810e20111215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446916972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agrformet.2011.07.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNeirynck, J.10aLong-term (13 years) measurements of SO2 fluxes over a forest and their control by surface chemistry  ap. 1768-1780.  aLong-term fluxes of sulphur dioxide (SO₂) have been measured over a mixed suburban forest subjected to elevated SO₂ concentrations. The net exchange was shown to be highly dynamic with substantial periods of both upward and downward fluxes observed in excellent conditions for flux measurement. Upward fluxes constituted 30% of selected fluxes and appeared more frequently when the canopy was acidic. Upward fluxes were shown to be due to desorption from a drying surface or when ambient levels declined after periods of increased SO₂ exposure. The long term average SO₂ flux (F) was −59ngSO₂m⁻²s⁻¹ for the period 1997–2009 corresponding to an average SO₂ concentration of 12.3μgSO₂m⁻³ and a deposition velocity υd of 5mms⁻¹. The smallest deposition fluxes and υd were measured in dry conditions (−42ngm⁻²s⁻¹ and 3.5mms⁻¹, resp.), which represented 57% of all cases. Wet canopies were more efficient sinks for SO₂ and a dew-wetted canopy had a smaller υd (6mms⁻¹) than a rain-wetted canopy (ca 10mms⁻¹). Seasonal variability reflected differences in chemical climate or canopy buffering properties. During the summer half-year when surface acidity was low due to higher NH₃/SO₂ ratios, a higher deposition efficiency (υd/υdₘₐₓ) and lower non-stomatal resistance (Rw) were observed compared to winter conditions. Comparisons of Rc for different combinations of canopy wetness and surface acidity categories emphasized the importance of both factors in regulating the non-stomatal sinks of SO₂. Increased surface water acidity gradually led to a lower υd/υdₘₐₓ and an increased Rc for all considered canopy wetness categories. The smallest υd/υdₘₐₓ ratio and highest Rc were obtained for a dry canopy with high surface acidity. Conversely, a rain-wetted canopy was the most efficient sink for SO₂. The canopy sink strength was further enhanced by high friction velocities (u*), optimizing the mechanical mixing into the canopy. Long-term trends were strongly coupled to changes in the NH₃/SO₂ ratio, which has clearly enhanced the deposition efficiency of SO₂ in recent years.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidity 3acanopy 3aclimate 3adesorption 3amixed forests 3amixing 3aseasonal variation 3asulfur dioxide 3asummer 3asurface water1 aFlechard, C.R.1 aFowler, D.0 tAgricultural and forest meteorology.g2011 Dec. 15, v. 151, no. 12 p.1768-1780dElsevier B.V.x0168-19237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2011.07.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01102naa a2200241 u 4500001001200000008004100012016002200053024003200075040001800107100001900125245011300144300001400257520030900271592002800580650001100608650001700619650002100636650001000657773012700667856004500794852000900839655001200848IND44733068120727e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447330682DNAL7 a10.1002/jpln.2011000722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFröberg, Mats10aResidence time of fine‐root carbon using radiocarbon measurements of samples collected from a soil archive  ap. 46-48.  aFine roots from the soil archive of the Swedish National Forest Soil Inventory, collected in 1964, 1972, 1985, and 1998, were analyzed for 14C contents.

The sensor surface could be regenerated at least 100 times, allowing the determination of a cell surface antigen profile of RBCs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibodies 3aerythrocytes 3aimage analysis 3asurface antigens 3asurface plasmon resonance1 aBentlage, Arthur E.H.1 aStojanović, Ivan,1 avan der Kooi, Alex1 avan der Schoot, Ellen1 aTerstappen, Leon W.M.M.1 aVidarsson, Gestur0 tAnalytical biochemistry.g2013 Aug. 1, v. 439, no. 1 p.4-6dElsevier Inc.x0003-26977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ab.2013.04.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03318naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001600171245016200187300001800349520146800367592002801835650002501863650001901888650002801907650001801935650001901953650000901972650002601981650001002007650001302017650001302030650002002043650001702063650001202080650001302092650001902105650006502124650004502189650001202234650004602246650003902292650004802331650000902379650002302388700001802411700001902429700001202448700001902460700001502479700001302494700002002507773010402527856008802631852000902719655001202728IND4384608220221118012946.0141017e200611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438460822DNAL7 a170545132pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-294X.2006.03090.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHUNT, E.

This allows the examination of the role of single plant genes in the interaction between the plant and an aphid. Our initial studies have exploited an Arabidopsis genotype in which the function of the amino acid transporter ANT1 has been abolished. This mutation results in a change in the proportions of several amino acids within the phloem sieve elements (SEs) resulting in an increase in the proportion of essential amino acids. This has been measured using aphid stylectomy to collect SE samples, followed by a novel micellar electrokinetic chromatography method for amino acid analysis. The SE content represents the aphid's diet, and use of electrical penetration graph technology and honeydew clocks have demonstrated that this altered diet results in a change in the feeding rate of the aphid. Balance sheets can be produced to show the amount (nmoles/24 h) of each of 18 amino acids taken up and excreted by aphids feeding on wild type and ant1 mutant plants. The data show that aphids feeding on the ant1 mutant take up larger amounts of amino acids. However, we could not detect any effect on the reproductive rate of the aphids. The results show that, under experimental conditions, this model system can be used to identify plant genes that control the behaviour and fecundity of an insect pest.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aMyzus persicae 3aamino acid transporters 3abalance sheet 3achromatography 3adiet 3aessential amino acids 3agenes 3agenotype 3ahoneydew 3ainsect behavior 3ainsect pests 3amutants 3amutation 3asieve elements 2aAmino Acid Transport Systems, Neutralxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aAmino Acidsxanalysisxpharmacokinetics. 2aAnimals 2aAphidsxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aArabidopsisxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aDiet 2aModels, Biological1 aPRITCHARD, J.1 aBENNETT, M.

To overcome these disadvantages, we developed transgenic rats carrying a secreted enzyme Cypridina luciferase (CLuc) reporter under the promoter of clock gene Per2 (Per2–CLuc). Per2–CLuc activity in serially sampled blood from freely moving rats exhibited robust circadian rhythms with a peak at early morning. The Per2–CLuc bioluminescence could be quantified even with approximately 100pl of plasma. Plasma Per2–CLuc rhythms were phase reversed, and the level was reduced by restricting food access for 2h during the light phase, suggesting that the plasma Per2–CLuc rhythms reflect the phase of peripheral clocks entrained to feeding cues as well as fuel metabolism. Fasting for 2days did not alter the circadian Per2–CLuc rhythms in rats, suggesting that feeding per se did not affect the circadian Per2–CLuc rhythms. Tissue-specific Per2–CLuc rhythms were observed in culture medium of peripheral tissues. The Per2–CLuc reporter is a powerful tool to access gene expression in vivo as well as ex vivo with ordinary laboratory equipment.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioluminescence 3ablood 3acircadian rhythm 3aculture media 3afasting 3afuels 3agene expression 3agenes 3alaboratory equipment 3aluciferase 3aluciferin 3ametabolism 3amonitoring 3arats 3atissues 3atransgenic animals1 aNishide, Shin-ya1 aNakajima, Yoshihiro1 aWatanabe, Toshiyuki1 aOhmiya, Yoshihiro1 aHonma, Kenʼichi,1 aHonma, Sato0 tAnalytical biochemistry.g2013 Aug. 15, v. 439, no. 2 p.80-87dElsevier Inc.x0003-26977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ab.2013.04.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02384naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002100146245009500167300001600262520115100278592002801429650000801457650001501465650001301480650003501493650001401528650001301542650001001555650001101565650002501576650003001601650001201631700002001643700002501663700002201688700001801710700002001728700002501748773010001773856008001873852000901953655001201962IND60083119620221120053904.0141101e20130815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008311962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ab.2013.04.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPaireder, Stefan10aComparison of protocols for DNA extraction from long-term preserved formalin fixed tissues  ap. 152-160.  aThe current study compared the applicability of protocols to extract DNA from formalin fixed heart tissues that have been preserved for more than 50years. Ten methods were tested: a cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) standard protocol, seven variants of this standard protocol, and two commercial kits. In the case of younger specimens (fixed in 1951, 1934, or 1914), extracts with DNA concentrations⩾10.0ng/μl were obtained with the standard CTAB protocol, two variants of the standard protocol including prolonged tissue digestion (72h instead of 1–2h), and a commercial kit particularly recommended for DNA extraction from formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissues (FFPE Kit). With the FFPE Kit, DNA could also be extracted from older tissues (fixed in 1893, 1850/1851, or before 1820). In general, the purity of the DNA extracts, assessed from the ratio of the absorbance at 260 and 280nm, was not very high. In spite of their rather low purity, the DNA extracts could, however, be used to amplify a 122-bp sequence and, in most cases, also a 171-bp sequence of the gene coding for human albumin by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR).  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aabsorbance 3aalbumins 3acetyltrimethylammonium bromide 3adigestion 3aformalin 3aheart 3ahumans 3anucleotide sequences 3apolymerase chain reaction 3atissues1 aWerner, Bettina1 aBailer, J.q(Josef),1 aWerther, Wolfgang1 aSchmid, Erich1 aPatzak, Beatrix1 aCichna-Markl, Margit0 tAnalytical biochemistry.g2013 Aug. 15, v. 439, no. 2 p.152-160dElsevier Inc.x0003-26977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ab.2013.04.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02377naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002200152245008800174300001400262500000900276520127200285592002801557650001501585650001201600650001301612650001401625650001401639650000901653650002201662650001601684650001901700650001301719650001601732650001301748650002001761650001201781651001101793773009901804856005501903852000901958655001201967IND4469172720221118012923.0120727e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446917272DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-294X.2011.05375.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHart, Michael W.,10aNew sea urchin phylogeography reveals latitudinal shifts associated with speciation  ap. 26-27.  aNEWS  aWhere do new species arise? When do they form and how do they diverge from a common ancestor? A new comprehensive study of Arbacia sea urchins provides surprising answers to these questions. By combining mtDNA phylogeographic markers with a nuclear locus (encoding the sperm acrosomal protein bindin) known to be susceptible to high rates of adaptive codon evolution, Lessios et al. (2012) show that new species and lineages arose relatively recently, most often in association with latitudinal shifts between the temperate zones and the tropics, and in one case, in association with a significant geological barrier to gene flow (the rise of the Isthmus of Panama). In addition to the ‘where’ and ‘when’ of Arbacia speciation, these new data resolve an important question about ‘who’Arbacia species are by revealing extensive allele sharing at both loci between a pair of broadly sympatric nominal species (that should perhaps be considered a single taxon). ‘How’Arbacia diverge from each other is less easily resolved: there is no evidence for reinforcement (via selection on bindin) as an important source of divergence between nominal species, and there are few other data to decide among the alternative hypotheses to explain Arbacia speciation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEchinoidea 3aalleles 3aancestry 3aevolution 3agene flow 3aloci 3amitochondrial DNA 3anew species 3aphylogeography 3aproteins 3aspermatozoa 3asympatry 3atemperate zones 3atropics 3aPanama0 tMolecular ecology.g2012 Jan., v. 21, no. 1 p.26-27dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0962-10837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-294X.2011.05375.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02745naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094024002200128024001900150040001800169100002800187245012500215300001400340506007600354520129400430592002801724506003701752650003101789650001501820650001401835650002601849650002801875650003101903650001701934650001601951650001301967650001701980650001501997650001402012650002302026650001302049650001702062700002102079773009802100856008002198852000902278655001202287IND60083121420221207122531.0141101e20130901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008312142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ab.2013.05.0072doi7 aPMC37143382pmcid7 a237117252pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParitala, Hanumantharao12aA continuous spectrophotometric assay for adenosine 5′-phosphosulfate reductase activity with sulfite-selective probes  ap. 32-39.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) adenosine 5′-phosphosulfate (APS) reductase (APR) catalyzes the first committed step in sulfate reduction for the biosynthesis of essential reduced sulfur-containing biomolecules, such as cysteine, and is essential for survival in the latent phase of tuberculosis (TB) infection. Despite the importance of APR to Mtb and other bacterial pathogens, current assay methods depend on the use of ³⁵S-labeled APS or shunt adenosine 5′-monophosphate (AMP) to a coupled-enzyme system. Both methods are cumbersome and require the use of expensive reagents. Here, we report the development of a continuous spectrophotometric method for measuring APR activity by using novel sulfite-selective colorimetric or “off–on” fluorescent levulinate-based probes. Thus, the APR activity can be followed by monitoring the increase in absorbance or fluorescence of the resulting phenolate product. Using this assay, we determined Michaelis–Menten kinetic constants (Kₘ, kcₐₜ, and kcₐₜ/Kₘ) and the apparent inhibition constant (Kᵢ) for adenosine 5′-diphosphate (ADP), which compared favorably with values obtained in the “gold standard” radioactive assay. The newly developed assay is robust and easy to perform with a simple spectrophotometer.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aMycobacterium tuberculosis 3aabsorbance 3aadenosine 3aadenosine diphosphate 3aadenosine monophosphate 3aadenylyl-sulfate reductase 3abiosynthesis 3acolorimetry 3acysteine 3afluorescence 3amonitoring 3apathogens 3aspectrophotometers 3asulfates 3atuberculosis1 aCarroll, Kate S.0 tAnalytical biochemistry.g2013 Sept. 1, v. 440, no. 1 p.32-39dElsevier Inc.x0003-26977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ab.2013.05.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02162naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094024002200128024001900150040001800169100002900187245016300216300001400379506007600393520089500469592002801364506003701392650003201429650001901461650001701480650003901497650004701536650002001583700002201603773009801625856008001723852000901803655001201812IND60083121520221207122609.0141101e20130901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008312152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ab.2013.04.0332doi7 aPMC37708952pmcid7 a237481452pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCalizo, Rhodora Cristina10aDiscrepancy between fluorescence correlation spectroscopy and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching diffusion measurements of G-protein-coupled receptors  ap. 40-48.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aFluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) are the two most direct methods to measure the diffusion of molecules in intact living cells. Ideally, these methods should produce similar results for an identical system. We have used these methods to monitor the diffusion of two G-protein-coupled receptors and their associated proteins in the plasma membranes of cells that do not or do contain invaginated protein domains called caveolae. FRAP studies show that caveolae domains increase the immobile fraction of receptors without significantly changing their mobility. On the other hand, FCS studies show an unexpected increase the mobility of caveolae-associated proteins. Our data suggest that the geometry of caveolae domains gives rise to a confined diffusion of its attached proteins, resulting in an apparent increase in mobility.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aG-protein coupled receptors 3ablood proteins 3afluorescence 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3afluorescence recovery after photobleaching 3aplasma membrane1 aScarlata, Suzanne0 tAnalytical biochemistry.g2013 Sept. 1, v. 440, no. 1 p.40-48dElsevier Inc.x0003-26977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ab.2013.04.0333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04430naa a2200793 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003300135040001800168100002100186245009700207300001200304506007600316520212200392592002802514506003702542650001702579650001102596650002702607650000902634650001302643650001402656650002502670650000902695650002302704650001102727650001002738650001402748650000902762650002302771650002402794650000902818650001202827650002002839650001202859650002502871650001202896650001202908650002302920650001002943650002002953650000902973650005602982650001103038650001103049650000903060650004303069650002203112650003203134650001603166650002603182651001903208651002703227700001903254700002103273700002403294700002603318700001903344700001903363700001903382700001803401773011603419856008003535852000903615655001203624IND50066609620221207120659.0210217e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006660962DNAL7 a236685442pmid7 aPMC36558412pmcid7 a10.1186/1746-6148-9-1022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWestgarth, Carri10aPet ownership, dog types and attachment to pets in 9–10 year old children in Liverpool, UK  ap. 102.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Little is known about ethnic, cultural and socioeconomic differences in childhood ownership and attitudes to pets. The objective of this study was to describe the factors associated with living with different pet types, as well as factors that may influence the intensity of relationship or ‘attachment’ that children have to their pet. Data were collected using a survey of 1021 9–10 year old primary school children in a deprived area of the city of Liverpool, UK. RESULTS: Dogs were the most common pet owned, most common ‘favourite’ pet, and species most attached to. Twenty-seven percent of dog-owning children (10% of all children surveyed) reported living with a ‘Bull Breed’ dog (which includes Pit Bulls and Staffordshire Bull Terriers), and the most popular dog breed owned was the Staffordshire Bull Terrier. Multivariable regression modelling identified a number of variables associated with ownership of different pets and the strength of attachment to the child’s favourite pet. Girls were more likely to own most pet types, but were no more or less attached to their favourite pet than boys. Children of white ethnicity were more likely to own dogs, rodents and ‘other’ pets but were no more or less attached to their pets than children of non-white ethnicity. Single and youngest children were no more or less likely to own pets than those with younger brothers and sisters, but they showed greater attachment to their pets. Children that owned dogs lived in more deprived areas than those without dogs, and deprivation increased with number of dogs owned. ‘Pit Bull or cross’ and ‘Bull Breed’ dogs were more likely to be found in more deprived areas than other dog types. Non-whites were also more likely to report owning a ‘Pit Bull or cross’ than Whites. CONCLUSIONS: Gender, ethnicity and socioeconomic status were associated with pet ownership, and sibling status with level of attachment to the pet. These are important to consider when conducting research into the health benefits and risks of the common childhood phenomenon of growing up with pets.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBull Terrier 3aWhites 3aattitudes and opinions 3aboys 3abrothers 3achildhood 3acultural differences 3adogs 3aelementary schools 3agender 3agirls 3aownership 3apets 3apreschool children 3aregression analysis 3arisk 3arodents 3aschool children 3asisters 3asocioeconomic status 3asurveys 2aAnimals 2aHuman-Animal Bond. 2aChild 2aData Collection 2aDogs 2aEthnicityxpsychologyxstatistics & numerical data. 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMale 2aOwnershipxstatistics & numerical data 2aPsychology, Child 2aSurveys and Questionnaires. 2aSex Factors 2aSocioeconomic Factors 3aUnited Kingdom 0aEnglandxepidemiology.1 aBoddy, Lynne M1 aStratton, Gareth1 aGerman, Alexander J1 aGaskell, Rosalind M.,1 aCoyne, Karen P1 aBundred, Peter1 aMcCune, Sandra1 aDawson, Susan0 tBMC veterinary research.g2013 Dec., v. 9, no. 1 p.102-102dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4152735x1746-61487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1746-6148-9-1023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02764naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002400146245018700170300001600357520143100373592002801804650002301832650001301855650001301868650002001881650004601901650001101947650001601958650001601974650002701990650002002017650002902037650004402066700002102110700001902131700002602150773010102176856008002277852000902357655001202366IND60083121720221121135030.0141101e20130915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008312172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ab.2013.05.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMagdenoska, Olivera10aDispersive solid phase extraction combined with ion-pair ultra high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry for quantification of nucleotides in Lactococcus lactis  ap. 166-177.  aAnalysis of intracellular metabolites in bacteria is of utmost importance for systems biology and at the same time analytically challenging due to the large difference in concentrations, multiple negative charges, and high polarity of these compounds. To challenge this, a method based on dispersive solid phase extraction with charcoal and subsequent analysis with ion-pair liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry was established for quantification of intracellular pools of the 28 most important nucleotides. The method can handle extracts where cells leak during the quenching. Using a Phenyl-Hexyl column and tributylamine as volatile ion-pair reagent, sufficient retention and separation was achieved for mono-, di-, and triphosphorylated nucleotides. Stable isotope labeled nucleotides were used as internal standards for some analytes. The method was validated by determination of the recovery, matrix effects, accuracy, linearity, and limit of detection based on spiking of medium blank as well as standard addition to quenched Lactococcus lactis samples. For standard addition experiments, the isotope-labeled standards needed to be added in similar or higher concentrations as the analytes. L. lactis samples had an energy charge of 0.97±0.001 which was consistent with literature, whereas some differences were observed compared with legacy data based on ³³P labeling.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLactococcus lactis 3abacteria 3acharcoal 3adetection limit 3aelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry 3aenergy 3ametabolites 3anucleotides 3asolid phase extraction 3astable isotopes 3atandem mass spectrometry 3aultra-performance liquid chromatography1 aMartinussen, Jan1 aThykaer, Jette1 aNielsen, Kristian Fog0 tAnalytical biochemistry.g2013 Sept. 15, v. 440, no. 2 p.166-177dElsevier Inc.x0003-26977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ab.2013.05.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02251naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002400146245012600170300001600296520123700312592002801549650001901577650002001596650001201616650001701628650002001645650001401665650001201679700002101691700002301712773010101735856008001836852000901916655001201925IND60083122020221122213010.0141101e20130915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008312202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ab.2013.05.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNikiforova, Anna B.10aRapid fluorescent visualization of multiple NAD(P)H oxidoreductases in homogenate, permeabilized cells, and tissue slices  ap. 189-196.  aIntracellular NAD(P)H oxidoreductases are a class of diverse enzymes that are the key players in a number of vital processes. The method we present and validate here is based on the ability of many NAD(P)H oxidoreductases to reduce the superoxide probe lucigenin, which is structurally similar to flavins, to its highly fluorescent water-insoluble derivative dimethylbiacridene. Two modifications of the method are proposed: (i) an express method for tissue homogenate and permeabilized cells in suspensions and (ii) a standard procedure for cells in culture and acute thin tissue slices. The method allows one to assess, visualize, and localize, using fluorescent markers of cellular compartments, multiple NADH and NADPH oxidoreductase activities. The application of selective inhibitors (e.g., VAS2870, a NOX2 inhibitor; plumbagin, a NOX4 inhibitor) allows one to distinguish and compare specific NAD(P)H oxidoreductase activities in cells and tissues and to attribute them to known enzymes. The method is simple, rapid, and flexible. It can be easily adapted to a variety of tasks. It will be useful for investigations of the role of various NAD(P)H oxidoreductases in a number of physiological and pathophysiological processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNAD (coenzyme) 3aNADP (coenzyme) 3aflavins 3afluorescence 3aoxidoreductases 3aplumbagin 3atissues1 aFadeev, Roman S.1 aKruglov, Alexey G.0 tAnalytical biochemistry.g2013 Sept. 15, v. 440, no. 2 p.189-196dElsevier Inc.x0003-26977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ab.2013.05.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02076naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245010600164300001200270520094200282592002801224650001501252650002001267650002101287650002801308650001601336650002501352650001701377650001801394650001801412650001501430650001701445700002901462700002701491773009501518856008001613852000901693655001201702IND60083123420221121224452.0141101e20131001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008312342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ab.2013.06.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNourani, Sara10aMagnetic nanoparticle-based immunosensor for electrochemical detection of hepatitis B surface antigen  ap. 1-7.  aAn electrochemical immunosensor was developed for the detection of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). The biotinylated hepatitis B surface antibody was immobilized on streptavidin magnetic nanoparticles and used for targeting the HBsAg. By the addition of horseradish peroxidase conjugated with secondary antibody (HRP–HBsAb), a sandwich-type immunoassay format was formed. Aminophenol as substrate for conjugated HRP was enzymatically changed into 3-aminophenoxazone (3-APZ). This electroactive enzymatic production (3-APZ) was transferred into an electrochemical cell and monitored by cyclic voltammetry. Under optimal conditions, the cathodic current response of 3-APZ, which was proportional to the HBsAg concentration, was measured by a glassy carbon electrode. The immunosensor response was linear toward HBsAg in the concentration range from 0.001 to 0.015ng/ml with a detection limit of 0.9pg/ml at a signal/noise ratio of 3.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibodies 3adetection limit 3aelectrochemistry 3aglassy carbon electrode 3ahepatitis B 3ahepatitis B antigens 3aimmunoassays 3aimmunosensors 3ananoparticles 3aperoxidase 3astreptavidin1 aGhourchian, Hedayatollah1 aBoutorabi, Seyed Mehdi0 tAnalytical biochemistry.g2013 Oct. 1, v. 441, no. 1 p.1-7dElsevier Inc.x0003-26977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ab.2013.06.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03045naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149100001800167245009200185300001600277520139300293592002801686650003001714650001301744650001801757650001501775650000901790650001101799650001401810650001601824650001401840650001401854650002501868650001001893650001201903650007201915650002901987650003202016650003102048650000902079650001102088650006602099650002002165650000902185650002402194650001402218650002702232700001802259700002102277773010002298856008402398852000902482655001202491IND4451728620221118013056.0141111e20110505xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445172862DNAL7 a212391222pmid7 a10.1016/j.vetmic.2010.12.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDilegge, S.K.10aPresence of the oral bacterium Capnocytophaga canimorsus in the tooth plaque of canines  ap. 437-445.  aCapnocytophaga canimorsus is a potentially pathogenic microorganism when transmitted to humans from the oral cavity of canines. Although there is some knowledge about the frequency of occurrence in canines, it is uncertain whether there is a correlation between its occurrence and lifestyle, health, or breed of dog. Samples of tooth plaque from a total of 131 canines were collected, cultured on selective media, and tested using physiological and molecular analyses to help discern the presence of C. canimorsus. Phylogenetic analyses determined that 49.2% of canines sampled carried a species of Capnocytophaga and 21.7% of the canines sampled in this study carried C. canimorsus. Statistical analyses found that male dogs and those that are neutered and spayed are more likely to host Capnocytophaga species. The data also suggested that breed was a statistically significant predictor of C. canimorsus, with the smaller breeds more likely to carry the potential pathogen. In addition, three “human” species of Capnocytophaga; C. ochracea, C. haemolytica, and one isolate of either C. gingivalis or C. granulosa were cultured from five canines. Sixteen canines sampled carried an unidentified Capnocytophaga species, with the sequences from all isolates forming a well-defined phylogenetic clade with 100% bootstrap support that may well represent a new species of Capnocytophaga.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCapnocytophaga canimorsus 3abacteria 3aculture media 3adog breeds 3adogs 3ahumans 3alifestyle 3anew species 3apathogens 3aphylogeny 3astatistical analysis 3ateeth 2aAnimals 2aCapnocytophagaxclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aDNA, Bacterialxgenetics 2aDental Plaquexmicrobiology 2aDog Diseasesxmicrobiology 2aDogs 2aFemale 2aGram-Negative Bacterial Infectionsxmicrobiologyxveterinary. 2aLogistic Models 2aMale 2aMouthxmicrobiology 2aPhylogeny 2aSequence Analysis, DNA1 aEdgcomb, V.P.1 aLeadbetter, E.R.0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2011 May 5, v. 149, no. 3-4 p.437-445dElsevier B.V.x0378-11357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2010.12.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03016naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245013100174300001600305520134700321592002801668650001501696650001401711650001601725650002301741650002701764650002601791650001701817650001201834650001601846650002001862650002301882650002101905650001801926650001101944650001301955650002101968650001601989650001002005650001302015650000902028653001602037653001202053653002102065653002102086653002402107700003002131700002202161700002602183700002302209773012302232856008602355852000902441655001202450IND60631506320221120081831.0190701e20180704xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063150632DNAL7 a10.1080/17550874.2018.15391322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLopes, Polliana G.10aAllelopathy of a native shrub can help control invasive grasses at sites under ecological restoration in a Neotropical savanna  ap. 527-538.  aBackground: African C4 grasses threatens newly restored areas in Neotropical savannas. Allelopathy exhibited by some native species may contribute to ecological restoration. Aims: To establish the potential use of Lepidaploa aurea (Asteraceae) in ecological restoration of invaded savannas, we evaluated its allelopathic effects on two invasive grasses, a native grass, and two native trees (one savanna and one riparian forest species). Methods: We tested the allelopathic effects of the leaves and roots of L. aurea in a growth chamber, a greenhouse, and in field experiments. Results: Leaf extracts reduced the growth of all other species in the growth chamber experiment. Root extracts reduced growth in one invasive grass and promoted root growth in the savanna tree. The invasive grass and riparian forest tree were negatively affected when planted in soil where L. aurea had grown, whereas the savanna tree showed increased growth. Lepidaploa aurea litter reduced growth in one invasive grass species and increased root biomass accumulation in the native grass species. Conclusions: Lepidaploa aurea negatively affected the growth of invasive grasses, through plant extracts, litter and through soil. These patterns could explain its ability to colonise abandoned pasturelands and its high success of establishing in restoration areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAsteraceae 3aC4 plants 3aallelopathy 3abiomass production 3aecological restoration 3afield experimentation 3aforest trees 3agrasses 3agreenhouses 3agrowth chambers 3aindigenous species 3ainvasive species 3aleaf extracts 3aleaves 3apastures 3ariparian forests 3aroot growth 3aroots 3asavannas 3asoil 0aAllelopathy 0aCerrado 0ainvasion biology 0aLepidaploa aurea 0arestoration ecology1 aOliveira, Sarah C.

The structure is located in Seismic Zone 4, considered the highest-seismic-risk classification established by the U.S. Geological Survey. 3D finite element model was created in commercially available finite element software. As part of the seismic performance evaluation, two standard approaches for the structure seismic analysis were used; response spectrum analysis and nonlinear time-history analysis. Both approaches were used to compute inter-story drift ratios of the structure. Seismic fragility curves for each floor of the structure were generated using the ratios from the time history analysis with the FEMA guideline so as to evaluate their seismic vulnerability. The ratios from both approaches were compared to FEMA and LATBSDC limits. The findings revealed that the floor-level fragility mostly decreased for all the FEMA performance levels with an increase in height and the ratios from both approaches mostly satisfied the codified limits.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUnited States Geological Survey 3acomputer software 3aconcrete 3afinite element analysis 3ageophysics 3aguidelines 3amodels1 aHu, Jong Wan1 aDavaajamts, Burte0 tSustainability.g2015 Oct. 22, v. 7, no. 10 p.14287-14308dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su710142873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02839naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002600140245008200166300001400248500002000262520140500282592002801687596008201715596006801797596010201865650001801967650001301985650001601998650001102014650001802025650003602043650001702079650002302096650001002119650001202129700002602141700007302167773010502240856007502345852000902420655001202429IND60787208720221122084921.0220808e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078720872DNAL7 a10.1002/lipd.121892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchanuel, Fernanda S.10aShort‐Term Administration of a High‐Fat Diet Impairs Wound Repair in Mice  ap. 23-33.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aHigh intake of dietary fat plays an important role in obesity development in animals and humans, and prolonged intake of high‐fat diet might lead to low‐grade chronic inflammation. Previous study showed that diet‐induced overweight delays cutaneous wound healing in both obesity‐prone and obesity‐resistant animals, highlighting the importance of diet composition in the wound healing process. This study evaluated the hypothesis that a short‐term administration of high‐fat diet could affect cutaneous wound healing. Male mice (C57/bl6) were randomly divided into standard (10% energy from fat) or high‐fat (60% energy from fat) chow groups. After 10 days of diet administration, an excisional lesion was performed and the animals were sacrificed 6 or 10 days later. There was no difference in the fasting blood glucose between groups. Ten days after wounding, high‐fat chow group presented increased inflammatory infiltrate, levels of inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclo‐oxygenase‐2 proteins, and lipid peroxidation. The high‐fat chow group presented delayed wound closure, increased amount of myofibroblasts and vessels, and decreased deposition of type I collagen. These findings support the hypothesis that short‐term administration of high‐fat diet exerts negative effects on mice cutaneous wound healing, due to the interference in the inflammatory phase.  aPublisher supplied data  a304838/20152cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico  cCoordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior  a26/202.914/2017cFundação Carlos Chagas Filho de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado do Rio de Janeiro 3ablood glucose 3acollagen 3adietary fat 3aenergy 3ahigh fat diet 3ainducible nitric oxide synthase 3ainflammation 3alipid peroxidation 3amales 3aobesity1 aRomana‐Souza, Bruna1 aMonte‐Alto‐Costa, Andréa1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6572-78820 tLipids.g2020 Jan., v. 55, no. 1 p.23-33dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl46279x0024-42017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lipd.121893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03196naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245007100164300001600235520179100251592002802042650001902070650001602089650000902105650001002114650001402124650001402138650000902152650001002161650001602171650002502187650001002212650002002222650001702242650001802259650001202277650001802289650001202307650002302319653001202342653003702354653002002391653002002411773019202431856008202623852000902705655001202714IND60517661520221121123325.0190730e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051766152DNAL7 a10.1017/S00439339140006222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAKINDE, D.O.10aAmino acid efficiency with dietary glycine supplementation: Part 2  ap. 575-584.  aGlycine is a multi-tasking amino acid involved in multiple metabolic and functional systems, including sulphur amino acids, proteins and immunoglobulins syntheses, blood haem and bile production. Glycine is also capable of eliciting responses at whole animal level, such as those promoting gut and immune health, animal welfare as well as feed/food safety. Empirical evidence shows that glycine supplementation can arrest systemic inflammation via deletion of cytokine production. Some investigators have corrected gut wall damage in challenge studies via gastric infusion of glycine. Efficacy data further document that glycine aids bone accretion in broilers fed reduced protein diets. Given these glycine bioefficacies, particularly in broilers, its nutrition needs to be critically assessed in the light of modern paradigms of animal welfare, feed-food safety, efficiency, reduced antibiotic application, and eco-sustainability. Such efforts should concentrate on precise estimation of inevitable ileal flow of glycine so as to generate a database on the digestible glycine levels in feedstuffs. Only this can provide for proper control of feed glycine density. Controversies on dietary glycine optimum for broilers also need to be addressed, as this has significant ramifications for raw materials selection and eco-sustainability. Based on a meta-analysis of published reports a range of 1.91-2.27% of total glycine+serine is recommended in young broilers diets, depending on production goals. But clarity is still needed on how this may be modified by practical stress conditions. The efficacy of copious supplementation of crystalline glycine to promote key parameters of poultry health and zootechnical performance under different rearing conditions still needs to be resolved.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal welfare 3aantibiotics 3abile 3ablood 3acytokines 3adatabases 3adiet 3afeeds 3afood safety 3aglycine (amino acid) 3aileum 3aimmunoglobulins 3ainflammation 3ameta-analysis 3apoultry 3araw materials 3arearing 3asulfur amino acids 0aglycine 0aimmune and gut health efficiency 0adietary optimum 0afeed evaluation0 tWorld's poultry science journal.g2014 Sept., v. 70, no. 3 p.575-584dCambridge University Press on behalf of World&#x0027;s Poultry Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45575x1743-47777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00439339140006223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03234naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006200139245010000201300001800301500002000319520215100339592002802490650001702518650001702535650002002552650001902572650001502591650001902606650002602625650001302651650002502664773012502689856007302814852000902887655001202896IND60661462720221120091819.0190829e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066146272DNAL7 a10.1111/jbi.136362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Zhanshan (Sam)1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4397-263012aA new DTAR (diversity–time–area relationship) model demonstrated with the indoor microbiome  ap. 2024-2041.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAIM: The spatio‐temporal distribution of biodiversity is a core field of biogeography, and the so‐termed species–time–area relationship (STAR), together with its siblings, that is the SAR (species–area relationship) and STR (species–time relationship), has achieved the rare status of classic laws in ecology and biogeography. Traditionally, the STAR or its recent generalization DTAR (diversity–time–area relationship) has been described with the bivariate power law (BPL) model or more recently with Whittaker, Triantis, and Ladle (2008, Journal of Biography; 35: 18) general dynamic model (GDM). We propose to extend the classic BPL into a more flexible DTAR model, which offers new quantitative methods for estimating maximal global diversity and charactering the relationship between local and regional diversity. LOCATION: Indoor microbiome. TAXON: Microbes. METHOD: We revise the BPL model by introducing two taper‐off (cut‐off) parameters or BPLEC (bivariate power law with exponential cutoffs) model, which eventually overwhelms the unsaturated increase of diversity over time and/or space and consequently can offer more realistic modelling of the joint spatio‐temporal distribution of biodiversity. Based on the BPLEC model, we further define three new concepts for DTAR: maximal accrual diversity (MAD) profile, local‐to‐regional diversity (LRD) ratio profile and local‐to‐global diversity (LGD) ratio profile. RESULTS: We introduce and demonstrate the new BPLEC model with the indoor microbiome datasets (Lax et al., 2014, Science; 345: 1048–1052). The new model fitted to the microbiome datasets equally well or slightly better than existing BPL and GDM models, but it possesses two advantages stated below. MAIN CONCLUSION: First, the new BPLEC model overcomes the unlimited diversity accrual in temporal and/or spatial dimensions and hence offers more realistic modelling to the DTAR. Second, the MAD and LRD/LGD offer useful methods for estimating the “dark” or “potential” diversity, which accounts for the species locally absent but present in a habitat‐specific regional species pool.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3abiogeography 3adata collection 3adynamic models 3amicrobiome 3amicroorganisms 3aquantitative analysis 3asiblings 3aspatial distribution0 tJournal of biogeography.g2019 Sept., v. 46, no. 9 p.2024-2041dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl9765x0305-02707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jbi.136363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01273naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245011900161300001600280520028200296592002800578650002300606650002000629650001800649650001500667700002100682700002000703700002300723700002600746773010300772856007500875852000900950655001200959IND60578643320221118024551.0170813e20130201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057864332DNAL7 a10.1021/ol30348032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBifulco, Giuseppe10aQuantum Chemical Calculations of 1JCC Coupling Constants for the Stereochemical Determination of Organic Compounds  ap. 654-657.  aQuantum chemical calculations of one-bond carbon–carbon coupling constants are demonstrated as potential probes for the configurational assignment of organic molecules.

Recent ocean warming and thermal anomalies have caused pantropical episodes of coral bleaching, which has led to widespread coral mortality and a range of subsequent effects on coral reef communities. Although the response of many reef‐associated fishes to major disturbance events on coral reefs is negative (e.g., reduced abundance and condition), parrotfishes show strong feedbacks after disturbance to living reef structure manifesting as increases in abundance. However, the mechanisms underlying this response are poorly understood. Using biochronological reconstructions of annual otolith (ear stone) growth from two ocean basins, we tested whether parrotfish growth was enhanced following bleaching‐related coral mortality, thus providing an organismal mechanism for demographic changes in populations. Both major feeding guilds of parrotfishes (scrapers and excavators) exhibited enhanced growth of individuals after bleaching that was decoupled from expected thermal performance, a pattern that was not evident in other reef fish taxa from the same environment. These results provide evidence for a more nuanced ecological feedback system—one where disturbance plays a key role in mediating parrotfish–benthos interactions. By influencing the biology of assemblages, disturbance can thereby stimulate change in parrotfish grazing intensity and ultimately reef geomorphology over time. This feedback cycle operated historically at within‐reef scales; however, our results demonstrate that the scale, magnitude, and severity of recent thermal events are entraining the biological responses of disparate communities to respond in synchrony. This may fundamentally alter feedbacks in the relationships between parrotfishes and reef systems.  aPublisher supplied data  aBPMS2017‐7cFondation Bertarelli 3aScaridae 3abasins 3ableaching 3acoral bleaching 3acoral reefs 3acorals 3aecosystems 3afish 3agrazing intensity 3amortality 3aocean warming 3aotoliths1 aBenkwitt, Cassandra E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6756-79581 aChoat, Howard1 aClements, Kendall D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8512-59771 aGraham, Nicholas A.

Are reported their respective photocatalytic activities, chemical, morphological, and textural characteristics. For that, commercial photocatalysts InterBrasil® FA-101 and Fotosan® were deposited on fibrocement support to perform photocatalytic activity tests and characterization analyses. The measurement of the photocatalytic activity of each sample was carried out through the efficiency of H₂S degradation, using artificial (UV lamp) and natural (solar lighting) radiation. The surfaces formed with this photocatalyst coating were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDX), X-ray diffraction (XRD), nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms, diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), and Fourier infrared transformation using attenuated total reflection (ATR-FTIR). The volumetric flow rate and saturation time (deactivation) were evaluated as operational performance parameters of the degradation reaction. The X-ray diffraction shows that TiO₂ formed in the coatings correspond to the anatase phase. In addition, the pore volume of the coatings was from 4.9 to 9.0 × 10⁻³ g cm⁻³ and the superficial area was from 19.6 to 30.5 m² g⁻¹ that is considered relatively high. The results showed that, unlike the Fotosan®, the type of radiation used had a greater influence on the InterBrasil® FA-101, since there was a reduction of the photocatalytic activity when the solar radiation was used. The H₂S degradation efficiency of 80% was obtained for a residence time (RT) of 115 s using Fotosan®, whereas that for InterBrasil® FA-101 was reached 45% for the same RT. Lower on the photocatalytic activity was observed after 30 min and 390 min of reaction for the InterBrasil® FA-101 and Fotosan®, respectively. The sample containing Fotosan® was the most effective photocatalyst in comparison with InterBrasil® FA-101.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3acoatings 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3ahydrogen sulfide 3alighting 3anitrogen 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3areflectance spectroscopy 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asolar radiation 3atitanium dioxide1 aMorejon, Camilo Freddy Mendoza1 ade Oliveira Basso, Rodrigo Leonardo1 aTrevisan, Ana Paula1 ade Oliveira Tavares, Fernanda1 aBoroski, Marcela1 aHonório, Jacqueline Ferandin0 tWater, air, and soil pollution.g2020 May, v. 231, no. 5 p.193-193dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl4876x0049-69797nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-020-04560-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03521naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100003100140245015200171500002000323520166600343592002802009596004002037596006602077596006702143596006502210650002002275650002702295650002302322650001002345650002602355650002902381650001702410650002102427650003802448650001702486650001702503650001602520650002302536650003702559650001402596650001502610700002102625700001702646700002102663700002302684700006802707773014402775856007502919852000902994655001203003IND60759836220221122223125.0211214e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075983622DNAL7 a10.1111/jfpp.160412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNicolau‐Lapeña, Iolanda10aAntioxidant and antimicrobial activities of ginseng extract, ferulic acid, and noni juice: Evaluation of their potential to be incorporated in food  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aGinseng extract (GE), ferulic acid (≥99%) (FA), and a fermented noni juice powder (FNJP) were analyzed for their antioxidant and antimicrobial activities in vitro. Half inhibitory concentration (IC₅₀) was 29.87, 0.45, and 3.82 mg/mL, for GE, FA, and FNJP, respectively. The potential of the three extracts to inhibit polyphenol oxidase from three vegetable matrices ranged between no inhibition and 95.1% (depending on the extract and PPO source). In the study of peroxidation prevention by three types of fats, only ferulic acid delayed lipid peroxidation of olive oil when applied at 10 mg/mL. The extracts’ antimicrobial activity was investigated on 13 bacterial strains using the disk diffusion assay and the microdilution assay. Minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values were 5.5 mg/mL of GE for Listeria monocytogenes, 1.7 mg/mL of FA for Staphylococcus aureus, L. monocytogenes 1/2 and 4b and 4.2 mg/mL of FNJP for Bacillus cereus. The increases in lag phase and decreases in growth rate and in the asymptotic value of the bacteria growing under different concentrations of the three compounds were described. The results obtained suggest the potential of GE, FA and FNJP for its further application in food industries. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: The exploration of new compounds for their antioxidant properties increases the range of ingredients to be used in food products for different purposes (e.g. browning inhibition, delaying lipid peroxidation). Determining the antimicrobial properties and the minimum inhibitory concentrations of these compounds for food‐borne pathogens can help in promoting their use to enhance food safety.  aPublisher supplied data  aGA 720719cBBI‐JU‐H2020 Program  aBES‐2017‐079779cMinisterio de Economía y Competitividad  aIJC2018‐035287‐IcMinisterio de Economía y Competitividad  aRYC‐2016‐19949cMinisterio de Economía y Competitividad 3aBacillus cereus 3aListeria monocytogenes 3aMorinda citrifolia 3aPanax 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aantimicrobial properties 3aantioxidants 3acatechol oxidase 3adisk diffusion antimicrobial test 3afermentation 3aferulic acid 3afood safety 3alipid peroxidation 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3aolive oil 3avegetables1 aAbadias, Maribel1 aBobo, Gloria1 aLafarga, Tomás,1 aViñas, Inmaculada1 aAguiló‐Aguayo, Ingrid1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4867-15540 tJournal of food processing and preservation.g2021 Dec., v. 45, no. 12 p.e16041-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl45214x0145-88927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfpp.160413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02089naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132100001500150245007600165300001600241520102700257592002801284650001901312650001701331650001601348650001201364650001301376650001001389650000901399650001801408650001201426650001501438651001801453700001701471700001701488700001401505773008901519856008601608852000901694655001201703IND4446990120221118122950.0141111e20110515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444699012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2010.11.0352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTecher, I.10aAbout Sr isotopes in coffee ‘Bourbon Pointu’ of the Réunion Island  ap. 718-724.  aDemonstration of the regional source of a high-quality product is nowadays essential to protect it from commercial transactions and cheatings. In this study, Sr isotopes are proposed as a tool to identify the regional source of a vegetable, on the basis of a combined geochemical investigation on a Coffea Arabica var. Laurina cultivation plot located on th Réunion Island. The Sr isotopic composition (⁸⁷Sr/⁸⁶Sr) of the produced coffee beans (called Pointed Bourbon) and of their growing environment, including soils, parent rocks, waters and fertilizers are determined. Flux of Sr in coffee beans is mainly dominated by soil solutions that can be influenced by Sr-rich fertilizers. This influence is however low enough to detect the cultivation soils’ Sr isotopic ratio in the vegetable product, even after roasting. It also allows discrimination of coffees produced on varied geological areas. Measurements performed on the same variety of coffee beans produced in New Caledonia strengthen the demonstration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCoffea arabica 3acoffee beans 3afertilizers 3aislands 3aisotopes 3arocks 3asoil 3asoil solution 3atillage 3avegetables 3aNew Caledonia1 aLancelot, J.1 aDescroix, F.1 aGuyot, B.0 tFood chemistry.g2011 May 15, v. 126, no. 2 p.718-724dElsevier Ltdx0308-81467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2010.11.0353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01326naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002900151245008100180300001400261520028900275592002800564650000900592650001800601650001500619650002300634650001000657653000800667653000800675653000800683653002100691653002000712653002400732700001800756773009600774856008500870852000900955655001200964IND60609976620221122212916.0180824e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060997662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.econlet.2016.12.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAzzimonti-Renzo, Marina,12aA note on optimal fiscal policy in an economy with private borrowing limits  ap. 62-65.  aWe consider the implications for optimal fiscal policy when taxes are non-distortionary and households are heterogeneous and borrowing constrained.

The kinetics of moisture loss, solute gain, and effective diffusivity during SOD were predicted by fitting the experimental data with the Azuara model, Weibull model, and Fick second law model. The results showed that the high regression coefficient (R² > 0.9) and low χ² value represented the suitability of the Azuara model for predicting equilibrium water loss and solid gain and the Weibull model for predicting both moisture and solute fraction in jasmine under different process parameters during SOD. A relatively high sugar dose (120% w/w, fresh jasmine flower basis) and moderate sugar size (6–20 mesh) enhanced the moisture loss and solute uptake during SOD and produced more syrup. Furthermore, the high sugar dose (120% w/w) and small sugar size (40 mesh) enhanced the diffusion of polyphenols and flavonoids in jasmine to syrup. The mass transfer rate and syrup yield were increased, and more polyphenols, flavonoids, and antioxidant components were diffused to the syrup after applying the ultrasonic waves during SOD. Most flavour compounds of jasmine were effectively extracted by SOD under different process parameters, and alcohols (more than 68%) are the main flavour components of syrups, but the amount of major volatile compounds extracted was not affected by SOD process parameters.  aPublisher supplied data  aCARS-170502cAgriculture Research System of China (CARS-170502) 3aWeibull statistics 3aantioxidants 3abioprocessing 3adiffusivity 3aflavonoids 3aflavor 3aflowers 3amass transfer 3amodels 3aosmotic treatment 3apolyphenols 3aregression analysis 3asolutes 3asugars 3asyrups 3aultrasonic treatment 3aultrasonics1 aYu, Junzhe1 aCheng, Peng1 aWang, Shuo1 aHang, Fangxue1 aLi, Kai1 aXie, Caifeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8545-46471 aShi, Changrong0 tFood and bioprocess technology.g2022 May, v. 15, no. 5 p.1055-1072dSpringer USwJournal:jnl4235020x1935-51307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11947-022-02787-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03305naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245009900171300001600270520171500286536010402001592002802105650002402133650002402157650001602181650001702197650001302214650002102227650001102248650001202259650001902271650001702290650002202307650001002329650002902339650001902368650001002387651001002397653001902407653002602426653001002452653002402462653001802486700001602504700001402520700001702534700001502551773011402566856008602680852000902766655001202775IND60733472320221117234544.0220827e20200101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073347232DNAL7 a10.1080/13880209.2020.17385022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Jingjing10aInhibition of tanshinone IIA on renin activity protected against osteoporosis in diabetic mice  ap. 219-224.  aSalvia miltiorrhiza Bge. (Labiatae) (SMB) is applied clinically for management of diabetic osteoporosis in China, and research results has suggested its potential action on renin–angiotensin system (RAS). This study screens and explores naturally occurring bioactive constituents from the root of SMB acting on renin activity and evaluates its osteoprotective efficacy in diabetic mice. Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells, engineered to express human renin, were used as an in vitro model to identify bioactive compound, tanshinone IIA, inhibiting renin activity. The C57BL/6 mice (n = 10 in each group) with diabetes induced by streptozotocin (STZ) were intraperitoneally injected with tanshinone IIA (10 and 30 mg/kg). The mice without STZ treatment and the diabetic mice treated with aliskiren were used as non-diabetic control and positive control, respectively. Tanshinone IIA was found to display inhibitory effects on renin activity of HEK-293 cells; moreover, it down-regulated protein expression of ANG II in human renin-expressed HEK-293 cells. Treatment of diabetic mice with tanshinone IIA with both doses could significantly decrease ANG II level in serum (from 16.56 ± 1.70 to 10.86 ± 0.68 and 9.14 ± 1.31 pg/mL) and reduce ANG II expression in bone, consequently improving trabecular bone mineral density and micro-structure of proximal tibial end and increasing trabecular bone area of distal femoral end in diabetic mice. This study revealed beneficial effects of tanshinone IIA on bone of diabetic mice, and potentially suggested the application of Salvia miltiorrhiza in the treatment of osteoporosis and drug development of tanshinone IIA as a renin inhibitor.  aThis work was supported in part by Specially Invited Professor Program of Jiangsu Province (China).  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalvia miltiorrhiza 3abioactive compounds 3ablood serum 3abone density 3adiabetes 3adrug development 3ahumans 3akidneys 3amicrostructure 3aosteoporosis 3aprotein synthesis 3arenin 3arenin-angiotensin system 3astreptozotocin 3atibia 3aChina 0aAngiotensin II 0adiabetic osteoporosis 0arenin 0aSalvia miltiorrhiza 0aHEK-293 cells1 aCai, Zixuan1 aYang, Min1 aTong, Lijuan1 aZhang, Yan0 tPharmaceutical biology.g2020 Jan. 1, v. 58, no. 1 p.219-224dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2153x1744-51167nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13880209.2020.17385023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03602naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006600148245012000214300001100334520177700345592002802122596008802150596008302238650002702321650002002348650001902368650002502387650002002412650000902432650001902441650001302460650001402473650002202487650001102509650003002520650001502550650001702565650001702582650001902599650001902618650002302637650001302660700007202673700006102745700007102806773012702877856008303004852000903087655001203096IND60689175620221119025751.0210731e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068917562DNAL7 a10.1007/s11295-020-01434-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBernardi, Alison Paulo1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8804-088010aPhylogeography and species distribution modeling reveal a historic disjunction for the conifer Podocarpus lambertii  ap. 40.  aPhylogeography and species distribution models (SDMs) were integrated to test the hypothesis that the current disjunct distribution of Podocarpus lambertii, a cold-tolerant species, preserves the signature of Quaternary climatic oscillations, revealing historical barriers to gene flow. Twenty-five populations (286 individuals) of P. lambertii were screened for sequence variation at three intergenic cpDNA loci. We characterized the genetic diversity, constructed a haplotype network, identified population groups based on genetic divergence among populations and putative refugial areas, and tested the association between genetic and geographic distances. For SDMs, we used an ensemble approach based on five algorithms to estimate climatically suitable areas for the species during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), Holocene (HOL), and the present-day (PD). For all populations, haplotype and nucleotide diversity were 0.676 and 4.8 × 10⁻⁴, respectively. Neutrality tests indicated a recent expansion for the species. Analysis of molecular variance revealed genetic divergence among populations (FST = 0.1385), significantly correlated with geographic distances (r = 0.524, p < 0.01). Bayesian analysis suggested the formation of a Southern Group (SG) and Northern Group (NG), separated by a barrier to gene flow, with high differentiation among groups (FCT = 0.6458). The SDMs showed temporal changes in an area suitable for P. lambertii, mainly present at high altitudes and cold temperatures. The main occurrence area of P. lambertii now resides in SG, owing to a colder climate when compared with NG and the expansion of Araucaria angustifolia, a nurse plant that may have created better microclimatic conditions for P. lambertii expansion.  aPublisher supplied data  aFAPESC/2780/2012-4cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico  a305980/2018-1cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico 3aAraucaria angustifolia 3aBayesian theory 3aHolocene epoch 3aPodocarpus lambertii 3achloroplast DNA 3acold 3acold tolerance 3aconifers 3agene flow 3agenetic variation 3agenome 3ageographical distribution 3ahaplotypes 3amicroclimate 3anurse plants 3aphylogeography 3aplant genetics 3asequence diversity 3avariance1 aLauterjung, Miguel Busarello1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1300-77731 aMantovani, Adelar1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2952-21711 aReis, Maurício Sedrez dos,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1331-33670 tTree genetics & genomes.g2020 June, v. 16, no. 3 p.40-40dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3949857x1614-29427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11295-020-01434-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02640naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094024002200128024001900150040001800169100002200187245009500209300001400304506007600318520132300394592002801717506003701745650002201782650001901804650002301823650002801846650002201874650002201896650002101918650002601939650001101965700001901976700002501995700002402020773009702044856008002141852000902221655001202230IND60083029920221207132558.0141101e20111101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008302992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ab.2011.06.0312doi7 aPMC31642342pmcid7 a217827822pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoral, Mario E.G.10aMembrane inlet for mass spectrometric measurement of catalysis by enzymatic decarboxylases  ap. 73-77.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMembrane inlet mass spectrometry (MIMS) uses diffusion across a permeable membrane to detect in solution uncharged molecules of small molecular weight. We point out here the application of MIMS to determine catalytic properties of decarboxylases using as an example catalysis by oxalate decarboxylase (OxDC) from Bacillus subtilis. The decarboxylase activity generates carbon dioxide and formate from the nonoxidative reaction but is accompanied by a concomitant oxidase activity that consumes oxalate and oxygen and generates CO₂ and hydrogen peroxide. The application of MIMS in measuring catalysis by OxDC involves the real-time and continuous detection of oxygen and product CO₂ from the ion currents of their respective mass peaks. Steady-state catalytic constants for the decarboxylase activity obtained by measuring product CO₂ using MIMS are comparable to those acquired by the traditional endpoint assay based on the coupled reaction with formate dehydrogenase, and measuring consumption of O₂ using MIMS also estimates the oxidase activity. The use of isotope-labeled substrate (¹³C₂-enriched oxalate) in MIMS provides a method to characterize the catalytic reaction in cell suspensions by detecting the mass peak for product ¹³CO₂ (m/z 45), avoiding inaccuracies due to endogenous ¹²CO₂.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBacillus subtilis 3acarbon dioxide 3acatalytic activity 3acell suspension culture 3ahydrogen peroxide 3amass spectrometry 3amolecular weight 3aoxalate decarboxylase 3aoxygen1 aTu, Chingkuang1 aRichards, Nigel G.J.1 aSilverman, David N.0 tAnalytical biochemistry.g2011 Nov. 1, v. 418, no. 1 p.73-77dElsevier Inc.x0003-26977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ab.2011.06.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02786naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003000148245009200178300001400270520153500284592002801819596001901847650001601866650001401882650001301896650001101909650001101920650001301931650001201944650001501956651001401971700002701985700001802012700002702030700002202057700002302079700006802102773011502170856008202285852000902367655001202376IND60727987220221119213823.0210215e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072798722DNAL7 a10.1007/s12560-020-09451-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLópez, Gabriela Riviello10aPersistent Detection of Cosavirus and Saffold Cardiovirus in Riachuelo River, Argentina  ap. 64-73.  aCosaviruses (CoSV) and Saffold cardiovirus (SAFV) are novel members of the Picornaviridae family. The Matanza-Riachuelo river basin covers a total area of 2200 km² with approximately 60 km long. Its last section is called Riachuelo River. The aim of this study was to describe the circulation of both picornaviruses and their relationship with the environmental situation of the Riachuelo River using 274 samples collected from 2005 to 2015. CoSV and SAFV were investigated in samples available by two periods: 2005–2006 and 2014–2015 (103 and 101, respectively). Physicochemical and bacteriological parameters confirmed very high levels of human fecal contamination during the 11 years evaluated. CoSV was detected in 85.7% (66/77) and 65.4% (17/26) of the samples collected in 2005–2006 and 2014–2015 periods, respectively. Species A and D were identified, the first one being widely predominant: 74.1% (20/27) and 75.0% (3/4) in both periods. SAFV virus was detected in 47.1% (32/68) and 52.6% (10/19) in periods 2005–2006 and 2014–2015, respectively. SAFV-6 was the most identified genotype in the entire study, while SAFV-3 was predominant in 2005–2006. The contribution of genotypes 1, 2, 4 and 8 was minor. The high prevalence of CoSV and SAFV suggests that both viruses have been circulating in Argentina at least since 2005. Our results show that a watercourse with high rates of human fecal contamination can become a persistent source of new viruses which capacity to produce human diseases is unknown.  aPublisher supplied data  a2011cfocanlis 3aCardiovirus 3aCosavirus 3agenotype 3ahumans 3arivers 3avirology 3aviruses 3awatersheds 3aArgentina1 aMartinez, Leila Marina1 aFreyre, Laura1 aFreire, María Cecilia1 aVladimirsky, Sara1 aRabossi, Alejandro1 aCisterna, Daniel Marcelo1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7614-92720 tFood and environmental virology.g2021 Mar., v. 13, no. 1 p.64-73dSpringer USwJournal:21446x1867-03347nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12560-020-09451-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02586naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245007400165300001600239520144200255592002801697650002101725650001601746650001501762650001201777650001201789650001301801650002501814650001601839650001401855653002501869653001301894653001801907700001801925700001801943700001801961773011401979856008602093852000902179655001202188IND60733472420221117234535.0220827e20200101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073347242DNAL7 a10.1080/13880209.2020.17385032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDai, Lili10aResveratrol inhibits ACHN cells via regulation of histone acetylation  ap. 231-238.  aThe relationship between resveratrol and histone acetylation in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) has not yet been reported. To explore the functional role of resveratrol in RCC. Functional experiments were performed to determine proliferatio n of ACHN cells with treatment of resveratrol (0, 7.8125, 15.625, 31.25 and 62.5 μg/mL, for 12, 24 and 48 h of culture) or 0.1 μM SAHA. The enzyme activities of MMP-2/-9 were measured by gelatine zymography and histone acetylation by Western blot. When the cells were treated with 15.625, 31.25 and 62.5 μg/mL resveratrol, ACHN cells viability was 73.2 ± 3.5%, 61.4 ± 3.1%, 50.2 ± 4.7% for 12 h, 62.7 ± 4.5%, 52.4 ± 5.5%, 40.2 ± 3.8% for 24 h, and 60.8 ± 3.7%, 39.4 ± 5.1%, 37.6 ± 2.7% for 48 h, and the wound closure (%) of migration was increased from 0.6 to 0.7, 0.85, 0.9 for 12 h and from 0.23 to 0.3, 0.48, 0.59 for 24 h. The invasion rate was 8.5 ± 0.9%, 7.4 ± 0.3% and 5.8 ± 0.6%, and cell cycle was arrested at G1 from 42.5 ± 2.9% to 55.3 ± 5.7%, 59.8 ± 3.4%, 68.7 ± 4.6%. MMP-2/-9 expression (p < 0.05) was inhibited by resveratrol. The protein levels of histone acetylation (p < 0.01) was increased by resveratrol. Our results suggest that these effects might be related to a high level of histone acetylation, and resveratrol can be considered as an alternative treatment for RCC.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern blotting 3aacetylation 3acell cycle 3aenzymes 3agelatin 3ahistones 3arenal cell carcinoma 3aresveratrol 3aviability 0aRenal cell carcinoma 0aMMP-2/-9 0aproliferation1 aChen, Lingyan1 aWang, Wenjing1 aLin, Peizheng0 tPharmaceutical biology.g2020 Jan. 1, v. 58, no. 1 p.231-238dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2153x1744-51167nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13880209.2020.17385033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02860naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100005800140245005300198300001600251500002000267520147600287592002801763596006301791650002201854650001301876650001801889650002201907650001601929650001401945650001501959650001601974650002401990651001202014700002402026700002302050700002202073700001402095700001702109700002202126700002202148700001802170773013002188856007502318852000902393655001202402IND60787147020221122040946.0220807e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078714702DNAL7 a10.1002/jwmg.215772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCox, W.

We surveyed 305 sites with or near colonially nesting waterbirds for nesting reddish egrets (Egretta rufescens) during 2016 in Florida, USA, to identify factors that influenced the probability of occurrence and the abundance of nesting reddish egrets. Fifty‐eight of 150 (39%) sites with nesting waterbirds had ≥1 nesting pair of reddish egrets. Zero‐inflated Poisson models indicated that sites with a greater amount of foraging habitat within a 5‐km radius, with greater richness of nesting species, and, to a lesser extent, with shorter vegetation had a greater number of nesting reddish egrets. By contrast, the distance of an island from the mainland, an island's size, and an island's proximity to deep water did not influence the probability of occurrence or abundance of nesting reddish egrets. Our results suggest that effective management of large, speciose coastal rookeries are likely to benefit reddish egrets. Coastal restoration efforts that tightly link nest site management with high‐quality foraging habitat will be most likely to prove beneficial to reddish egrets. Long‐term management of reddish egrets will benefit from better knowledge of how sea level rise will alter the location and extent of foraging habitat. © 2018 The Wildlife Society.  aPublisher supplied data  aFL‐T‐F15AF00394cFlorida State Wildlife Grants Program 3aEgretta rufescens 3ahabitats 3anesting sites 3apopulation growth 3aprobability 3asea level 3avegetation 3awater birds 3awildlife management 3aFlorida1 aBankovich, Brittany1 aMalachowski, Katie1 aSchwarzer, Amy C.1 aPaul, Ann1 aRachal, Mark1 aLorenz, Jerome J.1 aMeyer, Kenneth D.1 aKent, Gina M.0 tjournal of wildlife management.g2019 Jan., v. 83, no. 1 p.184-191dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl46144x0022-541X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jwmg.215773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02296naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006400148245015200212300001400364520102200378592002801400650002201428650001901450650001401469650001401483650002201497650001301519650001601532650001201548650001401560650002601574650001301600650002001613651001301633700002601646700002001672773011501692856008201807852000901889655001201898IND60727987320221119213321.0210215e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072798732DNAL7 a10.1007/s12560-020-09448-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRāshid, Muḥammad,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6665-618X10aDetection of Human Adenovirus, Rotavirus, and Enterovirus in Tap Water and Their Association with the Overall Quality of Water in Karachi, Pakistan  ap. 44-52.  aDrinking water supplies in the developing world often serve as a biosphere for various organisms. Viral gastroenteritis is a neglected area of research in Pakistan, there are no data for the prevalence of enteric viruses in drinking water of the largest city of Karachi. The present study aimed to provide a survey of the existence of enteric viruses: human adenovirus (HAdV), human enteroviruses (hEV), and genotype A rotavirus (GARV) in tap water. Using a simple PCR approach, we detected 20%, 43%, and 23% of HAdV, hEV, and GARV in tap water samples, respectively. We have also shown an overall quality deficit of tap water at the pumping station and consumer tap. We have found no sample free from bacterial contaminations. The ranges for a total number of the heterotrophic plate count and coliform were found 8.7 × 10²–4.5 × 10⁶ CFU/mL and 210 to uncountable coliforms/100 mL, respectively. Moreover, we assessed the efficiency of small-scale water treatment methods for the removal of viruses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHuman enterovirus 3aMastadenovirus 3aRotavirus 3abiosphere 3acoliform bacteria 3agenotype 3aplate count 3asurveys 3atap water 3aviral gastroenteritis 3avirology 3awater treatment 3aPakistan1 aKhan, Muhammad Naseem1 aJalbani, Nusrat0 tFood and environmental virology.g2021 Mar., v. 13, no. 1 p.44-52dSpringer USwJournal:21446x1867-03347nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12560-020-09448-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04979naa a2200937 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006200148245017000210300001600380520242500396592002802821650001802849650001302867650001202880650001602892650002302908650002002931650002402951650001302975650001802988650001703006650001203023650001003035650001503045650002003060650001203080650001403092650002903106650001303135650001303148650003203161650002003193650003103213650001403244650001603258653000903274653002203283653002303305653002903328653000803357653001103365653000803376653000903384653000903393653000803402653000903410653000803419653001303427653000903440653000803449653000903457653000903466653000903475653000703484653000703491653000803498653000703506653000903513653000903522653000803531653000903539653000803548653000903556700004003565700006103605700002003666700002303686700002503709700002303734700002103757700002203778700002703800773011003827856008303937852000904020655001204029IND60635119920221116215925.0200210e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063511992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.clnu.2019.03.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 avan Beers, Martijn1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6193-316010aClinical outcome and cost-effectiveness of a 1-year nutritional intervention programme in COPD patients with low muscle mass: The randomized controlled NUTRAIN trial  ap. 405-413.  aThe efficacy of nutritional intervention to enhance short- and long-term outcomes of pulmonary rehabilitation in COPD is still unclear, hence this paper aims to investigate the clinical outcome and cost-effectiveness of a 12-month nutritional intervention strategy in muscle-wasted COPD patients.Prior to a 4-month pulmonary rehabilitation programme, 81 muscle-wasted COPD patients (51% males, aged 62.5 ± 0.9 years) with moderate airflow obstruction (FEV₁ 55.1 ± 2.2% predicted) and impaired exercise capacity (Wₘₐₓ 63.5 ± 2.4% predicted) were randomized to 3 portions of nutritional supplementation per day (enriched with leucine, vitamin D and polyunsaturated fatty acids) [NUTRITION] or PLACEBO (phase 1). In the unblinded 8-month maintenance phase (phase 2), both groups received structured feedback on their physical activity level assessed by accelerometry. NUTRITION additionally received 1 portion of supplemental nutrition per day and motivational interviewing-based nutritional counselling. A 3-month follow-up (phase 3) was included.After 12 months, physical capacity measured by quadriceps muscle strength and cycle endurance time were not different, but physical activity was higher in NUTRITION than in PLACEBO (Δ1030 steps/day, p = 0.025). Plasma levels of the enriched nutrients (p < 0.001) were higher in NUTRITION than PLACEBO. Trends towards weight gain in NUTRITION and weight loss in PLACEBO led to a significant between-group difference after 12 months (Δ1.54 kg, p = 0.041). The HADS anxiety and depression scores improved in NUTRITION only (Δ-1.92 points, p = 0.037). Generic quality of life (EQ-5D) was decreased in PLACEBO but not in NUTRITION (between-group difference after 15 months 0.072 points, p = 0.009). Overall motivation towards exercising and healthy eating was high and did not change significantly after 12 months; only amotivation towards healthy eating yielded a significant between-group difference (Δ1.022 points, p = 0.015). The cost per quality-adjusted life-year after 15 months was EUR 16,750.Nutritional intervention in muscle-wasted patients with moderate COPD does not enhance long-term outcome of exercise training on physical capacity but ameliorates plasma levels of the supplemented nutrients, total body weight, physical activity and generic health status, at an acceptable increase of costs for patients with high disease burden.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaccelerometry 3aair flow 3aanxiety 3abody weight 3acost effectiveness 3adiet counseling 3adietary supplements 3aexercise 3ahealth status 3ahealthy diet 3aleucine 3amales 3amotivation 3amuscle strength 3amuscles 3anutrients 3anutritional intervention 3apatients 3aplacebos 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 3aquality of life 3aquality-adjusted life year 3avitamin D 3aweight loss 0aCOPD 0aPhysical activity 0aCost-effectiveness 0aNutritional intervention 0aBMI 0aBREQ-2 0aCET 0aCOPD 0aDEXA 0aDHA 0aDLCO 0aEPA 0aEQ-5D-3L 0aFEV1 0aFVC 0aFFMI 0aHADS 0aICER 0aMI 0aPA 0aPAL 0aPR 0aPUFA 0aQALY 0aQMS 0aREBS 0aSDT 0aSGRQ1 aRutten-van Mölken, Maureen P.M.H.,1 avan de Bool, Coby1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6104-08801 aBoland, Melinde1 aKremers, Stef P.J.1 aFranssen, Frits M.E.1 avan Helvoort, Ardy1 aGosker, Harry R.1 aWouters, Emiel F.1 aSchols, Annemie M.W.J.0 tClinical nutrition.g2020 Feb., v. 39, no. 2 p.405-413dElsevier LtdwJournal:J000000059x0261-56147nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clnu.2019.03.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02730naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100008000148245014100228300001800369500001900387520122100406592002801627596008301655650001501738650001201753650002501765650001701790650003601807650001201843650004301855650002001898650001101918650002201929650001301951650001401964700002801978700003302006700002402039700002702063773011502090856008202205852000902287655001202296IND60689175920221119025620.0200419e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068917592DNAL7 a10.1007/s12161-020-01726-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ada Silveira, Tayse Ferreira Ferreira1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3913-538610aEffect of Solvent Composition on the Extraction of Phenolic Compounds and Antioxidant Capacity of Bacaba Juice (Oenocarpus bacaba Mart.)  ap. 1119-1128.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aStudying the phytochemical composition and bioactive potential of underexploited species is of great importance for promoting their valorization and for broadening the range of sources of bioactive compounds in the human diet. In this study, we used a simplex centroid mixture design to determine an optimal extraction solvent composition (using mixtures of water, acetone, and ethanol) for maximizing the extraction of phenolic compounds and the antioxidant capacity of bacaba juice (Oenocarpus bacaba). The compounds were identified and quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. Taxifolin, orientin, and isoorientin were identified and quantified in bacaba juice for the first time. It was possible to evidence the high potentiality of the bacaba regarding the contents of syringic, vanillic, ferulic, 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acids, and orientin, which have significantly contributed to the antioxidant capacity of the extracts. Thus, this study indicates that bacaba juice can provide antioxidant compounds. Moreover, the determined extraction conditions can be applied for obtaining extracts rich in potential bioactive properties for food and pharmaceutical applications.  aPublisher supplied data  a200994/2015-8cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico 3aOenocarpus 3aacetone 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3achemical constituents of plants 3aethanol 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahuman nutrition 3ajuices 3amass spectrometry 3asolvents 3ataxifolin1 ade Andrade Lima, Micael1 aMeinhart, Adriana Dillenburg1 aKuhnle, Gunter G.C.1 aGodoy, Helena Teixeira0 tFood analytical methods.g2020 May, v. 13, no. 5 p.1119-1128dSpringer USwJournal:jnl4237774x1936-97517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12161-020-01726-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02995naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245011300160500002200273520151100295592002801806650001601834650003101850650003101881650001301912650001601925650001001941650001701951650001601968650002001984650002102004650000902025650001402034653001602048653003102064653002102095653002002116653002402136700001602160700001402176700001702190700001402207700001602221700001802237700001702255700005602272773005902328856008102387852000902468655001202477IND60569017720221119170505.0170610s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056901772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lfs.2017.05.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Xia10aGallic acid increases atrial natriuretic peptide secretion and mechanical dynamics through activation of PKC  aPre-press version  aGallic acid (GA) protects against myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury, prevents cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis, and has anti-inflammatory activity in the heart. However, its effects in regulating atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) secretion are unknown. The aim of this study was to determine the function of GA in regulating ANP secretion and atrial dynamics in rat atria.GA (0.01, 0.05, and 0.1μmol/L) significantly increased atrial ANP secretion and induced positive inotropy dose-dependently. GA (0.1μmol/L) also increased plasma level of ANP and hemodynamics in rats. These effects were accompanied by upregulation of atrial protein kinase C subtypes β and ε (PKCβ and PKCε), which was completely blocked by LY333531 and EAVSLKPT, antagonists of protein PKCβ and PKCε, respectively. GA-induced ANP secretion was also attenuated by Gö6983 but not rottlerin, antagonists of PKCα and PKCδ, and the positive inotropy was reversed by Gö6983. U-73122, a phospholipase C (PLC) antagonist, mitigated the effects of GA on ANP secretion and mechanical dynamics and downregulated Phospho-PLCβ at Ser537 (pPLCβ S537), Phospho-PLCβ at Ser1105 (pPLCβ S1105), PKCβ and PKCε levels, whereas KN62, an inhibitor of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II, was not modified the GA-induced ANP secretion and suppressed GA-induced mechanical dynamics.GA promotes ANP secretion and effects positive inotropy with regard to mechanical dynamics through the activation of PLC-PKC signaling in rat atria.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantagonists 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3aatrial natriuretic peptide 3afibrosis 3agallic acid 3aheart 3ahemodynamics 3ahypertrophy 3aphospholipase C 3aprotein kinase C 3arats 3asecretion 0aGallic acid 0aAtrial natriuretic peptide 0aProtein kinase C 0aPhospholipase C 0aMechanical dynamics1 aZhang, Ying1 aHong, Lan1 aHan, Chun-Ji1 aZhang, Bo1 aZhou, Shuai1 aWu, Cheng-Zhe1 aLiu, Li-Ping1 aChʻoe, Hun,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1680-63540 tLife sciences.g2017, dElsevier Inc.x0024-32057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2017.05.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01508naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094024002200128024001900150040001800169100001800187245009300205300001400298506007600312520049100388592002800879506003700907650001600944650001200960650001600972700002000988773009701008856008001105852000901185655001201194IND60083030120221207083933.0141101e20111101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008303012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ab.2011.06.0162doi7 aPMC33547222pmcid7 a217419522pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Hyun Soo10aDevelopment of a universal glycosyltransferase assay amenable to high-throughput formats  ap. 85-88.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe development of a general 1-Zn(II) nucleoside diphosphate (NDP) sensor assay for rapid evaluation of glycosyltransferase (GT) activity is described.

ABTS assay (57.09%), HFRSA (57.30%), and SFRSA (51.40%) after 48 hr at 37°C in fermented goat milk. Further, the inoculation rate (2%) and incubation time (48 hr) for the production of peptides were also optimized using proteolytic activity at 37°C during the fermentation of goat milk. The molecular weight of proteins was analyzed by SDS‐PAGE and protein bands in the range of 10–51 kDa were found. The 2D gel electrophoresis exhibited 41 protein spots between 10 and 51 kDa. The trypsin digested protein spots were injected into RPLC/MS for amino acid sequencing. The 3 and 10 kDa permeate fragments were injected into RPLC/MS for characterization of peptides, and the peptide masses from LC/MS were analyzed on MASCOT. Novel antioxidative peptides viz., SCQDQPTTLAR (2D‐PAGE), TIDMESTEVFTKK (3 kDa Permeate), and YIQKEDVPSER (10 kDa Permeate) were identified from goat milk fermented with M2 by matching with BLASTp (NCBI), protein information resource (PIR), and BIOPEP databases. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Goat milk provides several health benefits, including antioxidative, antihypertensive, and antimicrobial properties. In terms of bio‐functional characteristics, goat milk fermented with healthy lactic acid bacteria could even add more value. Goat milk fermented with Lactobacillus fermentum M2 exhibited promising bioactivities like hydroxyl free radical scavenging assay, superoxide free radical scavenging assay, antioxidative activity, and proteolytic activities. A few novel antioxidative peptides, viz., SCQDQPTTLAR, TIDMESTEVFTKK, and YIQKEDVPSER, were identified from goat milk fermented with M2 by similarity searches using BLASTp, PIR, and BIOPEP databases. Furthermore, L. fermentum M2 could be used for the production of fermented goat milk with antioxidative activity and bioactive peptides.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLactobacillus fermentum 3aamino acids 3aantioxidant activity 3afree radicals 3agoat milk 3ahydroxyl radicals 3ainformation sources 3alactic acid 3alactic fermentation 3amolecular weight 3apeptides 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3aproteolysis 3atrypsin 3atwo-dimensional gel electrophoresis1 aDas, Sujit1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3084-09541 aSakure, Amar1 aSingh, Brij Pal1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8112-40501 aHati, Subrota1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4010-204X0 tJournal of food processing and preservation.g2021 Dec., v. 45, no. 12 p.e15992-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl45214x0145-88927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfpp.159923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01656naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002100146245006200167300002000229520070000249592002800949650001500977650001700992650002301009700002501032700002101057700006201078773013701140856008001277852000901357655001201366IND60606171420221120131258.0180724e20180509xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060617142DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b033372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAuerhammer, Nina10aExciton Coupling Enhancement in the Relaxed Excited State  ap. 11720-11729.  aThe steady-state and photoinduced dynamical optical properties of two squaraine-bodipy dye conjugates are the focus of this work. While the squared absorption transition moments of the dye conjugates can be traced back in an additive way to the constituents of the conjugates, this is not possible for the squared fluorescence transition moments. We suggest an enhancement of electronic coupling in the relaxed excited state to be responsible for this observation. Transient absorption and fluorescence upconversion experiments with femtosecond-time resolution give insight into the relaxation phenomena of the dye conjugates, in particular concerning the relaxation within the exciton manifold.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3afluorescence 3aoptical properties1 aSchmiedel, Alexander1 aHolzapfel, Marco1 aLambert, Christoph1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9652-91650 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2018 May 09, v. 122, no. 22 p.11720-11729dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b033373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01346naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001400142245004900156300002000205520042600225592002800651650002800679650001700707650003000724700001800754700006100772773015000833856007600983852000901059655001201068IND60672116420221118052604.0191009e20190923xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067211642DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.9b089832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMin, Long10aAsymmetric Total Synthesis of (−)-Vinigrol  ap. 15773-15778.  aA new strategy was developed for the asymmetric total synthesis of (−)-vinigrol.

As a pilot study, our results showed the timing and yield of the annual fruiting of Tricholoma matsutake varies in Southern Finland and can occur from the middle of July to middle of September; although we did not find a clear and simple correlation between fruiting and rainfall, an average amount of precipitation (i.e. 90–110% of the long-term average precipitation) prior to the first fruiting was associated with high yield; we did not identify any threshold soil temperature associated with the onset of fruiting, however, we found that soil temperature might provide a means to monitor the end of the matsutake fruiting period, and late onset or higher soil temperatures prior to the first fruiting were associated with shorter fruiting periods. These results can be further utilized for developing a model to predict the yield of T. matsutake in Nordic regions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTricholoma matsutake 3aair temperature 3aclimate 3afruiting 3afungi 3ahabitats 3aharvesting 3aheat sums 3arain 3asoil temperature 3aFinland 0aTricholoma matsutake 0apine mushroom 0afruiting pattern 0aprecipitation 0asoil temperature 0aproductivity1 aSavonen, Eira-Maija1 aPeltoniemi, Mikko1 aMiyazawa, Toyohiro1 aPulkkinen, Pertti1 aSarjala, Tytti0 tScandinavian journal of forest research.g2015 May 19, v. 30, no. 4 p.259-265dTaylor & Francisx1651-18917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02827581.2015.10062463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03015naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006000148245011900208300001400327520172800341592002802069650002102097650000802118650001402126650001002140650001102150650001102161650001902172650001002191650000902201650001802210650001802228650001202246650001302258650001202271651001402283651001402297651001302311700005102324773011502375856008202490852000902572655001202581IND60727987720221119213237.0210215e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072798772DNAL7 a10.1007/s12560-020-09452-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Mitchie Y.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7992-650510aOptimization and Implementation of the Virus Extraction Method for Hepatitis E Virus Detection from Raw Pork Liver  ap. 74-83.  aHepatitis E virus (HEV) has been frequently detected from pork liver and liver products, which can usually cause self-limiting diseases in healthy adults, yet may result in fatality in immunosuppressed groups. Nevertheless, there is so far no standardized method for HEV detection available from pork liver and/or liver products. The present study aimed to optimize the virus extraction method of HEV from raw pork liver, which is often consumed in Asia undercooked to avoid a grainy texture. By comparing different sample preparation protocols and by applying the selected protocol to 60 samples collected from Singapore retail markets, we demonstrated that homogenization of 0.25 g raw pork liver with FastPrep™ Lysing Matrix Y containing yttria-stabilized zircondium oxide beads in 2 ml tubes and with harsh mechanical force at 6 ms⁻¹, 40 s/cycle, for 5 cycles with 300 s pause time after each cycle is promising in both releasing the potentially intracellular viruses and resulting in satisfactory virus recovery rates (> 1%). A high prevalence (52%) of HEV genome was detected by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) from the 60 samples collected from Singapore retail markets imported from Indonesia, Australia and Malaysia. However, RNase treatment decreased the HEV prevalence to 33.3%, and all of the 20 positive samples were with high RT-qPCR Ct values above 35, suggesting that the positive RT-qPCR signals maybe largely due to the inactive viruses and/or exposed HEV RNA traces in raw pork liver products. Therefore, conscious care should be taken when interpreting molecular detection results of viruses from food samples to be correlated with public health risks.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOrthohepevirus A 3aRNA 3aSingapore 3adeath 3aforces 3agenome 3ahomogenization 3aliver 3apork 3apublic health 3aribonucleases 3atexture 3avirology 3aviruses 3aAustralia 3aIndonesia 3aMalaysia1 aLi, Dan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6645-24890 tFood and environmental virology.g2021 Mar., v. 13, no. 1 p.74-83dSpringer USwJournal:21446x1867-03347nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12560-020-09452-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03538naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100005700140245016700197500002000364520224100384592002802625650001702653650001702670650001102687650001502698650001102713650002202724650001502746650001802761700002402779700001902803700002802822700002302850700002802873700002302901773014402924856007503068852000903143655001203152IND60759837020221121150850.0211214e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075983702DNAL7 a10.1111/jfpp.159942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOsae, Richard1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2899-266810aAntioxidant activities, anti‐inflammatory, cytotoxic effects, quality attributes, and bioactive compounds of Ghanaian ginger under varied dehydration conditions  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThis study sought to determine how different dehydration methods affect the quality of Ghanaian ginger. Slices of ginger rhizomes were subjected to freeze drying (FD), relative humidity convective drying (RHCD), infrared drying (IR), microwave drying (MC), and pulsed vacuum drying (PVD). The quality characteristics of the dried slices were assessed and compared based on their levels of selected gingerols or gingerol derivatives and their chromatic properties, antioxidant activities, and flavonoid content. Analysis of the chromatic properties of the dried samples revealed that the chroma value and hue angle values were highest for the samples subjected to FD (32.99, 88.13°) compared with those subjected to RHCD (28.90, 85.69°), IR (26.66, 83.79°), MC (24.36, 79.78°), and PVD (21.73, 78.96°). FD best preserved and retained the total flavonoid content (69.01 mg GAE/g db) and antioxidant activities evidenced by results of DPPH (124.53 mgTE/g db) and CUPRAC (90.71 mgTE/g db) determinations than the samples subjected to RHCD, IR, MC, and PVD. Finally, the cytotoxic and anti‐inflammatory effects of extracts of the various dried ginger samples were evaluated using RAW 264.7 cells. Holistically, the samples from FD and RHCD gave the best outcomes for all the parameters compared. These two techniques are therefore recommended for large‐scale application because they enhance the quality of ginger by maintaining its chemical integrity. These findings provide a deeper understanding of the different dehydration techniques as well as serve as a guide on the selection of the right drying technique for fresh ginger. NOVELTY IMPACT STATEMENT: Ginger is one of the most extensively used spices in the world, but because of its high moisture content, it is usually dried to extend its shelf‐life. For commercial purposes, an effective, safe, and efficient dryer is necessary to produce high‐quality dried ginger. This dryer must be able to maintain the product quality while reducing processing time and energy usage. The findings of this study provide a deeper understanding of the different dehydration techniques as well as serve as a guide on the selection of the right drying technique for fresh ginger.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidants 3acytotoxicity 3aenergy 3aflavonoids 3aginger 3arelative humidity 3ashelf life 3awater content1 aApaliya, Maurice T.1 aKwaw, Emmanuel1 aChisepo, Michelle T.

Food and nutrient intake were assessed using a validated food frequency questionnaire. Micronutrients examined were vitamins B1, B2, B3, B6, B12, A, C, D, E and folic acid; Ca, K, P, Mg, Fe, Se, Cr, Zn, and iodine. The proportion of micronutrient inadequacy was evaluated using the EAR or adequate intake (AI) cut-offs. Diet quality was also determined using a 17-item energy-restricted Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) questionnaire.Compared to non-diabetic participants, those with pre-diabetes had lower intakes of total carbohydrates (CHO) and higher intakes of total fat and saturated fatty acids (SFA) and were more likely to be below EAR for folic, while diabetic participants had lower intakes of total CHO and higher intakes of protein, total fat, monounsaturated fatty acids, SFA and cholesterol and were less likely to be below EAR for vitamins B2, and B6, Ca, Zn and iodine. Diabetic participants disclosed higher adherence to the MedDiet than the other two groups.Older Mediterranean individuals with metabolic syndrome and diabetes had better nutrient adequacy and adherence to the MedDiet than those with pre-diabetes or no diabetes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAdequate Intakes 3aMediterranean diet 3aadults 3acalcium 3acarbohydrates 3acholesterol 3achromium 3across-sectional studies 3adiabetes 3afolic acid 3afood frequency questionnaires 3aiodine 3airon 3amagnesium 3amen 3ametabolic syndrome 3amonounsaturated fatty acids 3anutrient intake 3anutritional adequacy 3aobesity 3apotassium 3athiamin 3awomen 3azinc 0aPre-diabetes 0aDiabetes 0aNutrient adequacy 0aDiet quality 0aMediterranean diet1 aBouzas, Cristina1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1407-84611 aAbbate, Manuela1 aMartínez G., Miguel A.q(Martínez González),1 aCorella, Dolores1 aSalas-Salvadó, Jordi,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2700-74591 aZomeño, M.

Because they are shed in high numbers by infected individuals and can persist for a long time in the environment, they pose a serious threat to human health globally. Enteric viruses end up in the environment mainly through discharge or leakage of raw or inadequately treated sewage into water sources such as springs, rivers, dams, or marine estuaries. Human exposure then follows when contaminated water is used for drinking, cooking, or recreation and, importantly, when filter-feeding bivalve shellfish are consumed. The human health hazard posed by enteric viruses is particularly serious in Africa where rapid urbanisation in a relatively short period of time has led to the expansion of informal settlements with poor sanitation and failing or non-existent wastewater treatment infrastructure, and where rural communities with limited or no access to municipal water are dependent on nearby open water sources for their subsistence. The role of sewage-contaminated water and bivalve shellfish as vehicles for transmission of enteric viruses is well documented but, to our knowledge, has not been comprehensively reviewed in the African context. Here we provide an overview of enteric viruses and then review the growing body of research where these viruses have been detected in association with sewage-contaminated water or food in several African countries. These studies highlight the need for more research into the prevalence, molecular epidemiology and circulation of these viruses in Africa, as well as for development and application of innovative wastewater treatment approaches to reduce environmental pollution and its impact on human health on the continent.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBivalvia 3ahealth hazards 3ahuman health 3ahumans 3ainfrastructure 3amolecular epidemiology 3apublic water supply 3arecreation 3asanitation 3asewage treatment 3ashellfish 3aurbanization 3avirology 3awastewater treatment 3awater pollution 3aAfrica1 aLuke, Garry A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6020-32971 aKnox, Caroline1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7050-70210 tFood and environmental virology.g2021 Mar., v. 13, no. 1 p.1-31dSpringer USwJournal:21446x1867-03347nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12560-020-09456-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01638naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245009600173300001400269520059600283592002800879650001100907650001200918650001500930651001300945653000800958653000800966653002200974653002000996653001601016653001901032653001601051700001901067773009601086856008501182852000901267655001201276IND60609977420221122212901.0180824e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060997742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.econlet.2016.12.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaengchote, Kanis10aWhat happens when we forget?

However, can less information be beneficial? Using a panel of nationally representative sample of borrowers’ credit bureau information, we investigate the impact of the removal of adverse credit information for long-time delinquent borrowers in Thailand on their access to credit. The removal is a deliberated effort by policymakers to allow borrowers to reenter formal credit markets. Contrary to theoretical prediction, we find no evidence of a subsequent expansion in credit.  aPublisher supplied data 3acredit 3amarkets 3aprediction 3aThailand 0aG18 0aG21 0aHousehold finance 0aConsumer credit 0aInformation 0aCredit history 0aFresh start1 aTirapat, Sunti0 tEconomics letters.g2017 Feb., v. 151 p.96-99dElsevier B.V.wJournal:3059x0165-17657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.econlet.2016.12.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02679naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245009300169300001800262520132200280592002801602650001801630650002301648650001201671650001001683650000901693650001801702650001101720650001201731650004301743650001201786650003501798650001001833650002701843700001801870700002101888700002201909700002201931700002201953700002901975700002102004773010602025856008102131852000902212655001202221IND60438743920221122222641.0151023e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043874392DNAL7 a10.1007/s00299-015-1774-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHedayati, Vahideh10aPolymorphisms in the AOX2 gene are associated with the rooting ability of olive cuttings  ap. 1151-1164.  aKEY MESSAGE : Different rooting ability candidate genes were tested on an olive cross progeny. Our results demonstrated that only the AOX2 gene was strongly induced. OeAOX2 was fully characterised and correlated to phenotypical traits. The formation of adventitious roots is a key step in the vegetative propagation of trees crop species, and this ability is under strict genetic control. While numerous studies have been carried out to identify genes controlling adventitious root formation, only a few loci have been characterised. In this work, candidate genes that were putatively involved in rooting ability were identified in olive (Olea europaea L.) by similarity with orthologs identified in other plant species. The mRNA levels of these genes were analysed by real-time PCR during root induction in high- (HR) and low-rooting (LR) individuals. Interestingly, alternative oxidase 2 (AOX2), which was previously reported to be a functional marker for rooting in olive cuttings, showed a strong induction in HR individuals. From the OeAOX2 full-length gene, alleles and effective polymorphisms were distinguished and analysed in the cross progeny, which were segregated based on rooting. The results revealed a possible correlation between two single nucleotide polymorphisms of OeAOX2 gene and rooting ability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOlea europaea 3aadventitious roots 3aalleles 3acrops 3aloci 3amessenger RNA 3aolives 3aprogeny 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arooting 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3atrees 3avegetative propagation1 aMousavi, Amir1 aRazavi, Khadijeh1 aCultrera, Nicolò1 aAlagna, Fiammetta1 aMariotti, Roberto1 aHosseini-Mazinani, Mehdi1 aBaldoni, Luciana0 tPlant cell reports.g2015 July, v. 34, no. 7 p.1151-1164dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0721-77147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00299-015-1774-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03364naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100007500148245010600223300001200329500001900341520153400360592002801894596012301922596010402045596010602149650000902255650001102264650002502275650001402300650001702314650002602331650001902357650000902376650001702385650002702402651001102429700002702440700002502467700003102492700003402523700004102557700002002598700003802618773013402656856008302790852000902873655001202882IND60727987920221119213318.0210421e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072798792DNAL7 a10.1007/s12665-021-09456-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Paula Filho, Francisco José1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6253-461X10aAssessment of heavy metals in sediments of the Parnaíba River Delta in the semi-arid coast of Brazil  ap. 167.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aStudies related to heavy metal concentrations in coastal sediments are important to monitor and assess environmental health of estuarine ecosystems. Twenty-eight samples from Parnaíba River Delta, the largest open-ocean delta in the Americas, northeastern of Brazil were tested for heavy metals concentrations (Cd, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb, Zn, Al and Fe), grain-size and easily oxidizable carbon. The relations of the heavy metals with sediment composition were evaluated using a multivariate statistical analysis. Sediment pollution assessment was carried out by enrichment factor (EF), geoaccumulation index (Igeo), contamination factor (CF) and potential ecological risk index (PERI). The average concentrations were 0.50 ± 0.09 mg Cd kg⁻¹, 6.95 ± 2.13 mg Pb kg⁻¹, 19.02 ± 8.75 mg Cu kg⁻¹, 23.20 ± 5.04 mg Ni kg⁻¹, 33.52 ± 6.82 mg Cr kg⁻¹, 43.99 ± 7.47 mg Zn kg⁻¹, 165.73 ± 86.71 mg Mn kg⁻¹, 2.93 ± 0.89% to Fe and 3.78 ± 1.17% to Al. The results indicate lower concentrations of heavy metals relative to limit concentrations defined by the Brazilian regulatory framework. The multivariate analysis reflected the binding of heavy metals to clay minerals and organic carbon. The different geochemical indices indicated sediments minimally enriched by metals and a low potential ecological risk level. Our assessment confirms the pristine conditions of Parnaíba Delta protected area to heavy metal contamination, except Igaraçú channel near Parnaíba city.  aPublisher supplied data  aPR2-0101-00052.01.00/15/PRONEX/FUNCAP/CNPqcFundação Cearense de Apoio ao Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico  aBP3-0139-00276.01.00/18cFundação Cearense de Apoio ao Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico  a408363/2018-5/MCTIC/CNPq Nº 28/2018cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico 3aclay 3acoasts 3aenvironmental health 3aestuaries 3aheavy metals 3amultivariate analysis 3aorganic carbon 3arisk 3ariver deltas 3asediment contamination 3aBrazil1 aMarins, Rozane Valente1 aSantos, Deivid Vitor1 aPereira Junio, Raí Felipe1 aMenezes, Jorge Marcell Coelho1 ada Gastão, Francisco Gleidson Costa1 aGuzzi, Anderson1 aTeixeira, Raimundo Nonato Pereira0 tEnvironmental earth sciences.g2021 Feb., v. 80, no. 4 p.167-167dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000001228x1866-62807nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-021-09456-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02322naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002600153245012200179300001600301520075200317592002801069650001101097650001901108650001301127650001601140650001901156650001001175650002401185653002301209653002201232653002501254653002301279653002201302700001901324700002401343700001701367700002201384700002301406700002201429700001901451700001801470700002101488700002001509700001801529700002401547700001801571773011801589856008801707852000901795655001201804IND60569018120221119170444.0190318e20170715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056901812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.marpolbul.2017.05.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSartoretto, Stéphane13aAn integrated method to evaluate and monitor the conservation state of coralligenous habitats: The INDEX-COR approach  ap. 222-231.  aA new method based on photographic sampling coupled with in situ observations was applied to 53 stations along the French Mediterranean coast, to assess the integrity of coralligenous reefs affected by different levels of anthropogenic pressure. The conservation state of the assemblages characterizing these habitats was then assessed by an index – the INDEX-COR – that integrates three metrics: (i) the sensitivity of the taxa to organic matter and sediment deposition, (ii) the observable taxonomic richness, and (iii) the structural complexity of the assemblages. The sensitivity of INDEX-COR was tested and showed good correlation with the Level of Pressure calculated for each station according to expert judgment and field observations.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoasts 3aexpert opinion 3ahabitats 3amethodology 3aorganic matter 3areefs 3asediment deposition 0aCoralligenous reef 0aEcological status 0aEcological indicator 0aSeafloor integrity 0aMediterranean Sea1 aSchohn, Thomas1 aBianchi, Carlo Nike1 aMorri, Carla1 aGarrabou, Joaquim1 aBallesteros, Enric1 aRuitton, Sandrine1 aVerlaque, Marc1 aDaniel, Boris1 aCharbonnel, Eric1 aBlouet, Sylvain1 aDavid, Romain1 aFéral, Jean-Pierre1 aGatti, Giulia0 tMarine pollution bulletin.g2017 July 15, v. 120, no. 1-2 p.222-231dElsevier LtdwJournal:12420x0025-326X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2017.05.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02390naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100002400188245009100212300001100303506007600314520103500390592002801425596006801453596004501521506003701566650002201603650003001625650001101655650002001666650003001686650001401716700002101730700005701751773010501808856008201913852000901995655001202004IND60616586320221207052137.0200721e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061658632DNAL7 a303495822pmid7 aPMC61922092pmcid7 a10.1186/s13007-018-0359-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFischer, Matthew D.10aPyrite cloning: a single tube and programmed reaction cloning with restriction enzymes  ap. 91.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Insertion of engineered DNA fragments into bacterial vectors is the foundation of recombinant DNA technology, yet existing methods are still laborious, require many steps, depend on specific vector configuration, or require expensive reagents. RESULTS: We have developed a method, called “Pyrite” cloning that combines the traditional restriction enzyme digestion and ligation reaction in a single tube and uses a programmed thermocycler reaction, allowing rapid and flexible cloning in a single tube. After the Pyrite reaction and transformation, approximately 50% colonies contain the expected insert, which can be easily and quickly determined by colony PCR or blue-white colony screening. We also demonstrated that Pyrite cloning can be applied for different cloning purposes. CONCLUSIONS: The Pyrite cloning method reported here is a single tube and programmed reaction cloning with restriction enzymes. Compared to other cloning methods, Pyrite cloning is flexible, inexpensive, simple, and highly efficient.  aPublisher supplied data  aT32GM080201cNIH Training Program in Cell and Molecular Biology  aIOS 1444987cNational Science Foundation0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA fragmentation 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apyrite 3arecombinant DNA 3arestriction endonucleases 3ascreening1 aMgboji, Emmanuel1 aLiu, Zhongchi1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9969-93810 tPlant methods.g2018 Dec., v. 14, no. 1 p.91-91dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4337304x1746-48117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13007-018-0359-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02976naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245008700171300001600258520169200274592002801966650001101994650001002005650001902015650001602034650001602050650001202066653001102078653002502089653001302114653001602127653000802143700002502151700002102176700002402197700001702221700002102238700002202259700002302281700002102304773011202325856008402437852000902521655001202530IND60125814320221123034057.0150428e20150403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012581432DNAL7 a10.1080/09712119.2014.9286272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSlanina, Tomáš14aThe effect of diluent, temperature and age on turkey spermatozoa motility in vitro  ap. 131-136.  aThe aim of this study was to evaluate the turkey spermatozoa motility in in vitro conditions and to prove the effect of different conditions of incubation – diluents, temperature and age of birds. Spermatozoa were obtained from adult turkey's line of Big 6, and spermatozoa motility parameters were evaluated using a computer-assisted semen analyzer (CASA) system. Significant decrease of spermatozoa motility at laboratory temperature (22°C) was detected from time 0 (94.15%) till 180 minutes of incubation (53.91%). At the cool media incubation (5°C), this difference was lower (95.41 and 78.86%, respectively), and the differences were significant from 30 minutes of incubation till 180 minutes. Progressive spermatozoa motility replicated the tendency of total spermatozoa motility. When the physiological solution to commercial diluent at 5°C was compared, the spermatozoa motility and progressive motility in both groups were very consistent for 90 minutes of incubation. Subsequently, significantly higher spermatozoa motility was detected at time periods 120, 150 and 180 minutes of incubation in commercial diluent. Motility was also higher in this group after 24 hours. Influence of age on spermatozoa motility parameters was analysed at 22°C at the time 0 and after 30 minutes of incubation. Analysis of spermatozoa motility as well as progressive spermatozoa motility proved higher values in Group A (aged 35–42 weeks) compared to Group B (aged 63–73 weeks). These results clearly suggest that low temperature and commercial diluents maintain motility parameters during longer time periods and the increasing age of birds has negative impact on motility parameters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3asemen 3asperm motility 3aspermatozoa 3atemperature 3aturkeys 0aturkey 0aspermatozoa motility 0adiluents 0atemperature 0aage1 aPetrovičová, Lenka1 aMiškeje, Michal1 aKňížat, Lubomír1 aMirda, Juraj1 aLukáč, Norbert1 aTrandžík, Jozef1 aPetrovičová, Ida1 aMassányi, Peter0 tJournal of applied animal research.g2015 Apr. 3, v. 43, no. 2 p.131-136dTaylor & Francisx0974-18447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09712119.2014.9286273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02719naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245010400167300001600271520145400287592002801741650001501769650001901784650002201803650002101825650002101846650001101867650002401878650002101902650000901923653002801932653001101960653000901971653001501980653001401995700001802009700001702027700001702044700001502061773011402076856008602190852000902276655001202285IND60733473220221117234532.0220827e20200101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073347322DNAL7 a10.1080/13880209.2020.17463622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Huan10aEffects of puerarin on the pharmacokinetics of astragaloside IV in rats and its potential mechanism  ap. 328-332.  aPuerarin and astragaloside IV (AS-IV) are sometimes used together for the treatment of disease in Chinese clinics, however, the drug–drug interaction between puerarin and AS-IV is still unknown. This study investigates the effects of puerarin on the pharmacokinetics of astragaloside IV in rats and clarifies its main mechanism. The pharmacokinetic profiles of oral administration of astragaloside IV (20 mg/kg) in Sprague-Dawley rats, with or without pre-treatment of puerarin (100 mg/kg/day for 7 days) were investigated. The effects of puerarin on the transport and metabolic stability of AS-IV were also investigated using Caco-2 cell transwell model and rat liver microsomes. The results showed that puerarin could significantly increase the peak plasma concentration (from 48.58 ± 7.26 to 72.71 ± 0.62 ng/mL), and decrease the oral clearance (from 47.5 ± 8.91 to 27.15 ± 9.27 L/h/kg) of AS-IV. The Caco-2 cell transwell experiments indicated that puerarin could decrease the efflux ratio of astragaloside IV from 1.89 to 1.26, and the intrinsic clearance rate of astragaloside IV was decreased by the pre-treatment with puerarin (34.8 ± 2.9 vs. 41.5 ± 3.8 μL/min/mg protein). These results indicated that puerarin could significantly change the pharmacokinetic profiles of astragaloside IV, via increasing the absorption of astragaloside IV or inhibiting the metabolism of astragaloside IV in rats.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aastragalosides 3adrug interactions 3ahuman cell lines 3aliver microsomes 3amodels 3aoral administration 3apharmacokinetics 3arats 0aDrug–drug interaction 0aCYP3A4 0aP-gp 0ametabolism 0atransport1 aSong, Jiaying1 aDai, Huizhen1 aLiu, Yanchao1 aWang, Lili0 tPharmaceutical biology.g2020 Jan. 1, v. 58, no. 1 p.328-332dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2153x1744-51167nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13880209.2020.17463623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02652naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245009500168300001800263500001900281520120400300592002801504596025301532650002401785650001701809650001501826650001701841650001801858650004301876650001101919650001301930650002301943700002201966700002001988700002202008700001802030773011502048856008202163852000902245655001202254IND60689176720221119030039.0200419e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068917672DNAL7 a10.1007/s12161-020-01734-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLe, Phuong Hong10aImplementation of HPLC Analysis for γ-Aminobutyric Acid (GABA) in Fermented Food Matrices  ap. 1190-1201.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn this study, a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method was adapted to measure the γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate (Glu) content in different fermented foods. The best solvent to extract GABA and Glu from the food matrices was 75% EtOH and water, combined with 4% SSA as posttreatment. The extracted amino acids were derivatized with o-phthalaldehyde (OPA) for 2 min at room temperature and analyzed by HPLC with fluorescence detector (λex = 340 nm and λem = 455 nm). Animal-based fermented products had a higher GABA content, compared with plant-based and soy-based fermented products. Among 17 fermented samples, fish sauce showed the highest amount of GABA (16.29 ± 0.53 mg/kg DW). Results obtained by the HPLC method were compared with those obtained by a spectrophotometric method, which is based on the reaction of ω-amino acids with phenol. All measured GABA contents, obtained by HPLC method, were much lower than those obtained by the spectrophotometric method, which was due to the nonspecific reaction of the coloring reagent with other amino acids than GABA. It can be concluded that GABA content in food products can only be measured by HPLC.  aPublisher supplied data  aProject 911 Grant funded by Vietnam International Education Department (VIED), Ministry of Education and Training, Vietnam.cProject 911 Grant funded by Vietnam International Education Department (VIED), Ministry of Education and Training, Vietnam. 3aambient temperature 3afermentation 3afish sauce 3afluorescence 3aglutamic acid 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aphenol 3asolvents 3aspectrophotometers1 aVerscheure, Liesa1 aLe, Thien Trung1 aVerheust, Yannick1 aRaes, Katleen0 tFood analytical methods.g2020 May, v. 13, no. 5 p.1190-1201dSpringer USwJournal:jnl4237774x1936-97517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12161-020-01734-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02193naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245012000172300001100292520092700303592002801230596005401258596005401312596005401366650001101420650001001431650001401441650002001455650001101475650001301486650001101499650002201510650002901532700006501561773010101626856008301727852000901810655001201819IND60727988120221119213034.0220309e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072798812DNAL7 a10.1186/s13059-021-02279-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrzytycki, Pawel F.10aCellWalker integrates single-cell and bulk data to resolve regulatory elements across cell types in complex tissues  ap. 61.  aSingle-cell and bulk genomics assays have complementary strengths and weaknesses, and alone neither strategy can fully capture regulatory elements across the diversity of cells in complex tissues. We present CellWalker, a method that integrates single-cell open chromatin (scATAC-seq) data with gene expression (RNA-seq) and other data types using a network model that simultaneously improves cell labeling in noisy scATAC-seq and annotates cell type-specific regulatory elements in bulk data. We demonstrate CellWalker’s robustness to sparse annotations and noise using simulations and combined RNA-seq and ATAC-seq in individual cells. We then apply CellWalker to the developing brain. We identify cells transitioning between transcriptional states, resolve regulatory elements to cell types, and observe that autism and other neurological traits can be mapped to specific cell types through their regulatory elements.  aPublisher supplied data  aU01-MH116438cNational Institute of Mental Health  aR01-MH109907cNational Institute of Mental Health  aR01-MH123178cNational Institute of Mental Health 3aautism 3abrain 3achromatin 3agene expression 3agenome 3agenomics 3amodels 3asequence analysis 3atranscription (genetics)1 aPollard, Katherine S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9870-61960 tGenome biology.g2021 Dec., v. 22, no. 1 p.61-61dBioMed CentralwJournal:19127x1474-760X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13059-021-02279-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02702naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245012400169300001600293520130100309592002801610650001001638650001701648650001701665650001401682650001601696650001601712650001801728650001201746650001401758650000901772650001401781650001201795650001901807653002401826653001701850653002401867653002101891653000801912700001701920700001601937700001501953700001501968700002001983773011202003856008402115852000902199655001202208IND60125814520221123034055.0150428e20150403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012581452DNAL7 a10.1080/09712119.2014.9286322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGokuldas, P.P.10aFarrowing response and piglet viability following Cloprostenol-induced farrowing in Duroc sows with prolonged gestation  ap. 153-156.  aA trial was carried out to assess the effect of controlled induction of farrowing on sow performance and piglet viability in sows with prolonged gestation. Thirty healthy pregnant Duroc sows were randomly assigned into two groups balanced across the treatment for parity and day of gestation. Group I (n = 13) received a single intramuscular dose of prostaglandin analogue (2 ml Cyclix ® containing 263 µg/ml Cloprostenol) on day 114 of gestation. Sows in the Group II (n = 17) were allowed to farrow naturally and kept as control group. Treatment effects were significant (P < 0.01) on litter size and weight at weaning. Significantly higher litter weight at birth was also observed in Group I (9.8 vs 5.04 kg; P < 0.01). Parturition loss was comparatively lesser in induced farrowing and a relatively higher percentage of piglet survivability was observed in Group I (90.2% vs 80.0%). Treatment effects were significant (P < 0.05) on incidence of stillbirth (8.0% vs 24.4% in Group I and II, respectively). Relatively higher number of animals farrowed during daytime (53.85%) in Group I as compared to Group II (29.41%). In prolonged gestational cases, induction of farrowing can be a useful managerial tool for improving the piglet survival and facilitating greater supervision of farrowing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDuroc 3abirth weight 3acloprostenol 3afarrowing 3afetal death 3alitter size 3alitter weight 3apiglets 3apregnancy 3asows 3aviability 3aweaning 3aweaning weight 0afarrowing induction 0aCloprostenol 0aprolonged gestation 0apiglet viability 0asow1 aTamuli, M.K.1 aMohan, N.H.1 aBarman, K.1 aChutia, T.1 aMahapatra, R.K.0 tJournal of applied animal research.g2015 Apr. 3, v. 43, no. 2 p.153-156dTaylor & Francisx0974-18447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09712119.2014.9286323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02850naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094024002200128024001900150040001800169100002300187245018600210300001600396506007600412520143700488592002801925506003701953650001701990650001402007650001702021650001002038650001102048650001702059650002002076650001402096700002502110700001602135700001802151700001902169700002102188700001902209773009902228856008002327852000902407655001202416IND60083030820221207085532.0141101e20111101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008303082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ab.2011.06.0352doi7 aPMC31662342pmcid7 a217715742pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCrochet, Robert B.10aInvestigating combinatorial approaches in virtual screening on human inducible 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase (PFKFB3): A case study for small molecule kinases  ap. 143-148.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aEfforts toward improving the predictiveness in tier-based approaches to virtual screening (VS) have mainly focused on protein kinases. Despite their significance as drug targets, small molecule kinases have been rarely tested with these approaches. In this paper, we investigate the efficacy of a pharmacophore screening-combined structure-based docking approach on the human inducible 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase, an emerging target for cancer chemotherapy. Six out of a total 1364 compounds from NCI’s Diversity Set II were selected as true actives via throughput screening. Using a database constructed from these compounds, five programs were tested for structure-based docking (SBD) performance, the MOE of which showed the highest enrichments and second highest screening rates. Separately, using the same database, pharmacophore screening was performed, reducing 1364 compounds to 287 with no loss in true actives, yielding an enrichment of 4.75. When SBD was retested with the pharmacophore filtered database, 4 of the 5 SBD programs showed significant improvements to enrichment rates at only 2.5% of the database, with a 7-fold decrease in an average VS time. Our results altogether suggest that combinatorial approaches of VS technologies are easily applicable to small molecule kinases and, moreover, that such methods can decrease the variability associated with single-method SBD approaches.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acase studies 3adatabases 3adrug therapy 3adrugs 3ahumans 3apharmacology 3aprotein kinases 3ascreening1 aCavalier, Michael C.1 aSeo, Minsuh1 aKim, Jeong Do1 aYim, Young-Sun1 aPark, Seung-Jong1 aLee, Yong-Hwan0 tAnalytical biochemistry.g2011 Nov. 1, v. 418, no. 1 p.143-148dElsevier Inc.x0003-26977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ab.2011.06.0353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03848naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245011100166300001600277520165000293536038601943592002802329596004402357596001602401596001602417596001602433650001702449650001402466650001702480650001002497650001102507650001802518650002102536650001802557650001702575650001902592650001402611650002102625651001002646653001702656653003102673653003102704653002302735700001702758700001202775700001602787700001502803700001502818700001902833700001402852700001602866700001602882700001602898700002602914700001902940700001402959700001602973773011402989856008603103852000903189655001203198IND60733473420221117234516.0220827e20200101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073347342DNAL7 a10.1080/13880209.2020.17486612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Zihang12aA high-throughput assay for screening natural products that boost NK cell-mediated killing of cancer cells  ap. 357-366.  aNatural killer (NK) cells can eliminate malignant cells and play a vital role in immunosurveillance. Administration of natural compounds represents a promising approach for antitumor immunotherapy, which may enhance the NK cell activity via multiple mechanisms. Establishing approaches to evaluate the effect of select natural products on NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity. We selected a natural product library containing 2880 pure compounds, which was provided by the National Centre for Drug Screening of China. 0.1% DMSO was employed as a negative control, and 100 U/mL human recombinant IL-2 was employed as a positive control. To evaluate the % of tumour cells which were killed by NK cells, expanded NK cells were co-cultured with tumour cells and then treated with natural products at the concentration of 10 μM. After 24-h co-incubation, luminescent signal was detected and percent lysis was calculated. We report on the results of a three-round high-throughput screening effort that identified 20-deoxyingenol 3-angelate (DI3A) and its analogue ingenol 3-angelate (I3A) as immuno enhancers which boosts NK cell-mediated killing of non-small cell lung cancer cells (NSCLCs). Biophotonic cytotoxicity assay and calcein release assay were used as two well-established NK cell cytotoxicity detection assays to validate the immuno-enhancing effects of DI3A and I3A, which was achieved by increasing degranulation and interferon-gamma secretion of NK cells. Our newly established ATP-based method was a valuable and information-rich screening tool to investigate the biological effects of natural products on both NK cells and tumour cells.  aThis study was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China [81903932, 81803933, 81804017, and 81903848], Natural Science Foundation of Shanghai [19ZR1457500], Shanghai Youth Science and Technology Talents Sailing Plan [grant number: 18YF1423500] and the Interdisciplinary Project of “Clinical Immunology of Traditional Chinese Medicine” in Shanghai [30304113598].  aPublisher supplied data  a81903932a81803933a81804017,a81903848  a19ZR1457500  a18YF1423500  a30304113598 3abiophotonics 3acoculture 3acytotoxicity 3adrugs 3ahumans 3aimmunotherapy 3ainterferon-gamma 3ainterleukin-2 3aluminescence 3alung neoplasms 3asecretion 3atoxicity testing 3aChina 0aCytotoxicity 0anon-small cell lung cancer 0a20-deoxyingenol 3-angelate 0aingenol 3-angelate1 aZhu, Xiaowen1 aSu, Lin1 aZou, Chunpu1 aChen, Xiao1 aHou, Yifei1 aGong, Chenyuan1 aNg, Wanyi1 aNi, Zhongya1 aWang, Lixin1 aYan, Xuewei1 aZhu, Yangzhuangzhuang1 aJiao, Xiaoning1 aYao, Chao1 aZhu, Shiguo0 tPharmaceutical biology.g2020 Jan. 1, v. 58, no. 1 p.357-366dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2153x1744-51167nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13880209.2020.17486613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03743naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002400149245010300173300001400276520197900290592002802269650002202297650001802319650001702337650001902354650002602373650001102399650002602410650001502436650001902451650001702470650001302487650001902500650002402519650001802543650001702561650001302578653000702591653000802598653000802606653000802614653000702622653000702629653000902636653000702645653002402652653002202676653002502698653002802723653001802751653003702769700002102806700001902827700006002846773013002906856008403036852000903120655001203129IND60539620020221119222304.0190219e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053962002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jembe.2013.12.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArmbrecht, Linda H.10aCell death and aggregate formation in the giant diatom Coscinodiscus wailesii (Gran & Angst, 1931)  ap. 31-39.  aThe demise phase of diatom blooms following nutrient exhaustion is characterised by the formation of aggregates with high sinking rates that facilitate carbon export to the seafloor. However, the nature of the binding substances involved and the physiological status of the phytoplankton during aggregation are not well established. Transparent Exopolymer Particles (TEP), exudated by living cells, have been proposed as a binding agent of aggregates but autolysed cytoplasm released after cell death might also play such a role. To differentiate these processes we studied the response of cultures of the mucilage and TEP-producing giant diatom Coscinodiscus wailesii to nutrient, in particular silicic acid, limitation. Two staining methods were applied: SYTOX® Green to follow cell viability and cell death and Alcian Blue (AB) to quantify the production of TEP. Large aggregates formed exclusively in cultures with high cell densities in which the SYTOX® Green signal increased during the senescence phase. TEP-production under nutrient replete (f/2 treatment) and nitrate reduced growth conditions (f/2-N treatment) with high cell densities was comparatively low, indicating reduced photosynthetic activity in the stationary and senescent phases. In contrast, TEP-production was enhanced in low-density Si-limited cultures (f/2-Si treatment), probably as a means to discharge excess photosynthate, as the cells were densely packed with chloroplasts. The C/N ratios of aggregated and solitary cells did not differ significantly indicating that the binding agent was not mainly polysaccharidic. We propose that aggregate formation in C. wailesii is a consequence of cell lysis after cell death and that autolysed cytoplasm is the binding agent rather than TEP. This would imply that cell lysis plays a substantial role in bloom termination and mucilage formation in C. wailesii, which would in turn influence biogeochemical cycling in regions where this diatom thrives.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillariophyceae 3aCoscinodiscus 3aalgal blooms 3abinding agents 3abiogeochemical cycles 3acarbon 3acarbon nitrogen ratio 3acell death 3acell viability 3achloroplasts 3anitrates 3aphotosynthesis 3aphysiological state 3aphytoplankton 3asilicic acid 3astaining 0aAB 0aEPS 0aPCD 0aTEP 0aLC 0aDC 0aDCCM 0aEF 0aAutolysed cytoplasm 0aDiatom cell death 0aPolysaccharide layer 0aSilicic acid limitation 0aSYTOX® Green 0aTransparent exopolymer particles1 aSmetacek, V.

Surface sediments were dominantly silts with low percentage of clay and sand at nearshore and offshore areas. The mean metal concentrations were in the following order: Cr>Ni>Zn>Pb>Cu. The enrichment factor and geo-accumulation index of metals suggest that the surface sediments were not polluted by Zn and moderately polluted by Cu and Ni. By contrast, Cr and Pb showed significant enrichment levels. Results from a multivariate statistical analysis suggested that the spatial enrichment of these heavy metals was related to sediment type. Thus, the sediment distribution and their metal enrichment were mainly controlled by local hydrodynamic conditions that caused the winnowing of fine-grained sediments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3acarbon 3achromium 3aclay 3acoasts 3acopper 3aheavy metals 3ahydrodynamics 3alead 3amultivariate analysis 3anickel 3apollution 3asand 3azinc 3aIndia 0aTrace metals 0aSurface sediments 0aPollution assessment 0aArabian Sea1 aShynu, R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3572-57251 aSreeraj, M.K.1 aRamachandran, K.K.0 tMarine pollution bulletin.g2017 July 15, v. 120, no. 1-2 p.370-375dElsevier LtdwJournal:12420x0025-326X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2017.05.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05031naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094024002200126024001900148040001800167100001900185245010600204506007600310520312800386536001903514592002803533506003703561650002303598650002103621650002703642650001603669650002403685650001103709650002303720650001303743650001503756650001303771650001303784650002503797650001903822650001103841650000703852650001603859650002303875650001103898650002403909650002103933650001903954653002603973653002103999653001304020653002304033700002304056700002004079700002304099700002304122700002304145700001904168773011904187856007804306852000904384655001204393IND60672117220221207142224.0191009e20191002xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067211722DNAL7 a10.4081/ijfs.2019.81122doi7 aPMC67845942pmcid7 a316329282pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTirloni, Erica10aNon-thermal inactivation of Listeria spp. in a typical dry-fermented sausage: “Bergamasco” salami  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAim of the present study was the evaluation of the growth potential of Listeria spp. inoculated in the typical North Italian dry fermented sausage “Bergamasco” salami during its production. As it was necessary to carry out the challenge test in the production line of the industry, according to the guidelines of the European Reference Laboratory for Listeria monocytogenes, a non-pathogenic “surrogate” microorganism was used: for the inoculum, two strains of Listeria innocua (1 ATCC, 1 strain isolated from a similar substrate) were used. The inoculation of the samples occurred during grinding and mixing of the sausage mass, before the filling. To avoid cross-contamination, the control samples were produced before the contaminated ones. After the dripping, salamis were subjected to the normal production process (drying and maturation in five steps at specific temperatures and humidity rates). The inoculated products were subjected to the enumeration of Listeria spp. at T0 (day of inoculation) and at T4 (post-drying), and every 10 days during curing (T10, T20, T30, T40, T50, T60, T70, T80 and T90), as this salami is generally sold as whole piece with varying levels of curing (from T20 to T90). Since the product may be cut in half and vacuumpacked, at each of the times starting from T20, half salami was vacuum-packed and stored for 30 days at 12°C, at the end of the which Listeria spp. enumeration was performed again. At all times and for each type of samples of each of the three batches, the enumeration of the natural microflora (Total Viable Count, lactic acid bacteria, Pseudomonas spp., Enterobacteriaceae) and the determination of water activity and pH were performed on control samples. The product was characterized by a high concentration of microflora (8-8.5 Log UFC/g), consisting mainly of lactic acid bacteria, added to the mixture at the beginning of the production process. The pH showed a decrease over time, expected for this type of products, due to the development of lactic acid bacteria (final pH: 5.42-5.55). The water activity reached values able to inhibit the development of Listeria spp. (final aw: 0.826-0.863). Listeria counts in the tested batches of “Bergamasco” salami showed the absence of significant growth in the product with a reduction of loads if compared to T0, between -0.59 and -1.04 Log CFU/g. Even in the samples subjected to vacuum packaging and storage at 12°C, the absence of significant increase of lactic acid bacteria in the product was highlighted with further decrease of bacterial loads (-0.70/-0.79 Log CFU/g if compared to T20). Considering the worst case scenario (thus the batch with the highest growth potential), in the products stored in the curing room at 14-16°C, at humidity of 80% and in the samples stored at 12°C and vacuum packaged, the threshold indicated by the EURL Lm guidelines (+0.5 Log CFU/g) for the growth of Listeria spp. was not reached, allowing to classify “Bergamasco” salami in the category 1.3 of the EC Reg. 2073/2005 as “Ready-to-eat food unable to support the growth of Listeria monocytogenes”.  aFunding: none.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEnterobacteriaceae 3aListeria innocua 3aListeria monocytogenes 3aPseudomonas 3across contamination 3adrying 3afermented sausages 3agrinding 3aguidelines 3ahumidity 3ainoculum 3alactic acid bacteria 3amicrobial load 3amixing 3apH 3aplate count 3aready-to-eat foods 3asalami 3astorage temperature 3avacuum packaging 3awater activity 0adry-fermented sausage 0agrowth potential 0aListeria 0aEURL Lm guidelines1 aPietro, Vanessa Di1 aRizzi, Giuseppe1 aPomilio, Francesco1 aCattaneo, Patrizia1 aBernardi, Cristian1 aStella, Simone0 tItalian journal of food safety.g2019 Oct. 02, v. 8, no. 3dPAGEPress PublicationswJournal:23065x2239-71327nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4081/ijfs.2019.81123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03580naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245013300169300001600302520178100318592002802099650002302127650002502150650002802175650001702203650001802220650001802238650001302256650000902269650001802278650002202296650002102318650002102339650002002360650001202380650001502392650001602407650001502423650001702438650001502455650002502470650001402495653001402509653002302523653002202546653001102568653001402579700002002593700002002613700001802633700002002651700001902671700002202690700001802712700001902730773011202749856008402861852000902945655001202954IND60125814820221123034001.0150428e20150403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012581482DNAL7 a10.1080/09712119.2014.9286352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRomán, Lorena14aThe effect of probiotic Enterococcus gallinarum L-1 on the innate immune parameters of outstanding species to marine aquaculture  ap. 177-183.  aIn this work, we evaluated the effect of the probiotic Enterococcus gallinarum L-1 on the cellular immune system of four different fish species of great interest in aquaculture such as gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata), European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax), meagre (Argyrosomus regius) and red porgy (Pagrus pagrus). Phagocytic activity, respiratory burst and peroxidase content of leucocytes were observed 30 minutes after incubation with the probiotic E. gallinarum strain L-1, alive or inactivated with heat shock or ultraviolet (UV) light at different concentrations of 10 ⁷, 10 ⁸ and 10 ⁹ cfu mL ⁻¹ (final concentration 10 ⁶, 10 ⁷ and 10 ⁸ cfu mL ⁻¹). E. gallinarum produced dose-dependent increments in respiratory burst in red porgy, sea bream and sea bass leucocytes. About 10 ⁶ and 10 ⁷ cfu mL ⁻¹ of live and inactivated bacteria with no stimulation of the respiratory burst activity of sea bream and red porgy head kidney leucocytes was shown. The highest values of peroxidase content were observed in red porgy cells with stimulation indexes higher than 1 in each treatment. Statistical analysis revealed that differences were only significant in sea bream where UV light-inactivated bacteria denote statistically significant differences (P < 0.05) with respect to other treatments. Highest values of phagocytic activity were obtained in sea bream leucocytes incubated with live bacteria (26% ± 1.88), where significant differences (P < 0.05) with other species were detected. Our results suggest that the in vitro assays may be useful in optimising their effective dose and viability for the immunomodulatory effects of probiotic bacteria, although in vivo studies are necessary to confirm the immunomodulatory effect of this strain.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArgyrosomus regius 3aDicentrarchus labrax 3aEnterococcus gallinarum 3aPagrus major 3aPagrus pagrus 3aSparus aurata 3abacteria 3abass 3adose response 3aheat inactivation 3aimmunomodulation 3ain vitro studies 3ain vivo studies 3akidneys 3aleukocytes 3amariculture 3aperoxidase 3aphagocytosis 3aprobiotics 3astatistical analysis 3aviability 0aprobiotic 0agilthead sea bream 0aEuropean sea bass 0ameagre 0ared porgy1 aPadilla, Daniel1 aAcosta, Félix,1 aSorroza, Lita1 aFátima, ElAmri1 aDéniz, Soraya1 aGrasso, Valentina1 aBravo, Jimena1 aReal, Fernando0 tJournal of applied animal research.g2015 Apr. 3, v. 43, no. 2 p.177-183dTaylor & Francisx0974-18447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09712119.2014.9286353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03726naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001600149245012900165300001600294520169900310592002802009596005802037596006902095596006202164650003102226650001502257650002702272650002502299650000802324650001102332650001702343650002202360650001902382650001002401650001302411650001002424650001202434650001102446650001702457650001802474650001602492650001402508650001302522650001002535653001802545653003302563653003602596653003302632653003302665700001802698700001702716700001402733700001802747700001502765700002302780700001402803700006002817773010702877856008302984852000903067655001203076IND60680921920221120221219.0200110e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068092192DNAL7 a10.1094/PHYTO-06-19-0221-FI2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Zhaolei10aConstruction of an Infectious Poa semilatent virus cDNA Clone and Comparisons of Hordeivirus Cytopathology and Pathogenicity  ap. 215-227.  aPoa semilatent virus (PSLV), Lychnis ringspot virus (LRSV), and Barley stripe mosaic virus (BSMV) are members of the genus Hordeivirus in the family Virgaviridae. However, the biological properties and molecular genetics of PSLV have not been compared with other hordeiviruses. Here, we have constructed an infectious cDNA clone of the PSLV Canadian strain and provided evidence that PSLV differs from BSMV and LRSV. First, unlike the other two hordeiviruses that replicate in chloroplasts, PSLV induces dramatic structural changes in peroxisome during its infection in barley. The αa replication protein also localizes to peroxisomes, suggesting that PSLV replication occurs in peroxisomes. Second, PSLV encodes a γb protein that shares 19 to 23% identity with those of other hordeiviruses, and its activity as a viral suppressor of RNA (VSR) silencing is distinct from those of BSMV and LRSV. Substitution of the BSMV γb protein with that of PSLV or LRSV revealed a negative correlation between VSR activity and symptom severity of the recombinant BSMV derivatives. Intriguingly, the Ser-Lys-Leu (SKL) peroxisome-targeting signals differ among γb proteins of various hordeiviruses, including some BSMV strains. The presence of the C-terminal SKL motif in the γb protein impairs its silencing suppressor activity and influences symptoms. Finally, we developed a PSLV-based virus-induced gene silencing vector that induced strong and effective silencing phenotypes of endogenous genes in barley, wheat, and millet. Our results shed new light on hordeivirus pathogenesis and evolution, and provide an alternative tool for genomics studies of model hosts and economically important monocots.  aPublisher supplied data  a2016ZX08010-001cTransgenic Research Program of China  a31830106a31872637cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2019SKLAB1-14cProject for Extramural Scientists of SKLAB 3aBarley stripe mosaic virus 3aLiliopsida 3aLychnis ringspot virus 3aPoa semilatent virus 3aRNA 3abarley 3achloroplasts 3acomplementary DNA 3agene silencing 3agenes 3agenomics 3ahosts 3amillets 3amodels 3apathogenesis 3apathogenicity 3aperoxisomes 3aphenotype 3aproteins 3awheat 0acytopathology 0ainfectious hordeivirus clone 0aSKL peroxisome-targeting signal 0avirus-induced gene silencing 0aGAMMA b silencing suppressor1 aJiang, Zhihao1 aYang, Xinxin1 aYue, Ning1 aWang, Xueting1 aZhang, Kun1 aJackson, Andrew O.1 aLi, Dawei1 aZhang, Yongliang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6790-10440 tPhytopathology.g2020 Jan., v. 110, no. 1 p.215-227dPhytopathologywJournal:jnl44575x0031-949X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PHYTO-06-19-0221-FI3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02759naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245013900172520134400311592002801655650003001683650001501713650002201728650001401750650001901764650001901783650002501802650002001827650000901847650000701856650002301863650001601886650001501902650001601917653002801933653001601961653002301977653001302000653001702013653003002030700001502060773013402075856008302209852000902292655001202301IND60771895020221120175327.0220404e202212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077189502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enmm.2022.1006842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThangavelu, Kavitha10aEvaluating oil removal by amphiphilic MoS2/cellulose acetate fibrous sponge in a flow-through reactor and by artificial neural network  aThe amphiphilic Janus-like molybdenum disulfide/cellulose acetate (MoS₂/CA) fibrous sponges were synthesized and employed to remove oil from wastewater. The efficiency of treating 100 L of emulsion containing 10 mg/L of oil by MoS₂/CA fibrous sponge in a one-pass flow-through reactor was examined under different flow rates, pH, and temperature conditions. The oil concentrations in the treated effluent were all below the industrial discharge requirement of 5 mg/L. The spent sponges were successfully regenerated and reused in multiple cycles. It was found that the adsorption of oil followed the Langmuir adsorption isotherm (R² = 0.988) and pseudo-second-order kinetic (R² = 0.995). The hydrophobic/oleophilic MoS₂ component of the MoS₂/CA sponges was responsible for oil removal while its hydrophilic CA component allowed the material to be stable in the water. Artificial neural networking (ANN) was developed to optimize oil removal. The trained ANN was used to predict the oil removal of two new conditions. This study proved that our Janus-like MoS₂/CA sponge was both surfaces active and amphiphilic so can reach the targeted oil droplets in water. These findings provided the basis for the development of an efficient material that can treat large volumes of dilute oil-containing wastewater for water reuse.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadministrative management 3aadsorption 3acellulose acetate 3aemulsions 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3amolybdenum disulfide 3aneural networks 3aoils 3apH 3asorption isotherms 3atemperature 3awastewater 3awater reuse 0aMoS2/CA fibrous sponges 0aAmphiphilic 0aContinuous removal 0aIsotherm 0aAnd kinetics 0aArtificial neural network1 aZou, Linda0 tEnvironmental nanotechnology, monitoring & management.g2022 Dec., v. 18 p.100684-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23256x2215-15327nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enmm.2022.1006843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03229naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006200139245016800201300001800369500002000387520149400407592002801901596006901929650002601998650001602024650001802040650001902058650002102077650002602098650001702124650000902141650001902150650001202169650001502181650001502196650002502211650002202236650001602258700002002274700002002294700002802314700003402342700002202376700006202398700005802460773012302518856007302641852000902714655001202723IND60710981520221121221317.0200915e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071098152DNAL7 a10.1111/are.147802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIslam, SM Majharul1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8487-117410aElevated temperature affects growth and hemato‐biochemical parameters, inducing morphological abnormalities of erythrocytes in Nile tilapia Oreochromis niloticus  ap. 4361-4371.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aTemperature is considered as an important environmental factor, and the increasing water temperature resulting from global warming is a great concern. The present study was conducted to examine the effects of elevated water temperature on growth, hemato‐biochemical parameters in Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus acclimatized to three temperatures (31°C, 34°C and 37°C) for 60 days. Additionally, erythrocytic cellular abnormalities (ECA) and erythrocytic nuclear abnormalities (ENA) tests were assayed using peripheral erythrocytes after exposure to the three temperatures. Fish were sacrificed on days 7, 15, 30 and 60 of exposure. Growth performances viz., weight gain, % weight gain and specific growth rate (SGR) showed decreasing tendency at 34°C but significantly declined at 37°C compared to 31°C. The abundance of haemoglobin (Hb) and red blood cells (RBCs) significantly decreased in response to temperature increases, while white blood cells (WBCs) displayed the opposite response. At days 7 and 15, blood glucose levels significantly increased in response to the temperature increase, while at days 30 and 60 glucose declined. Frequencies of ECA and ENA were significantly enhanced at the highest temperature throughout the experimental period. Dissolved oxygen decreased and free CO₂ increased significantly with increasing temperature throughout the study period. The present study revealed that temperatures higher than 34°C may be hazardous to O. niloticus.  aPublisher supplied data  a2019/812/BAUcBangladesh Agricultural University Research System 3aOreochromis niloticus 3aacclimation 3ablood glucose 3acarbon dioxide 3adissolved oxygen 3aenvironmental factors 3aerythrocytes 3afish 3aglobal warming 3aglucose 3ahemoglobin 3aleukocytes 3aspecific growth rate 3awater temperature 3aweight gain1 aSultana, Rabaya1 aImran, Mohammad1 aJannat, Mst.

A library of tapered multiblock copolymers was prepared with different molecular weights (approximate molecular weights of 80, 240, and 400 kg/mol) and number of blocks (P(I-co-4MS)ₙ with 1 ≤ n ≤ 5), and their thermomechanical properties were investigated by differential scanning calorimetry, rheology, and tensile testing in relation to their nanodomain structure, the latter investigated by small-angle X-ray scattering. The interaction parameter between I and 4MS segments was obtained based on the order-to-disorder transition temperatures of a series of PI-b-P4MS diblock copolymers prepared by sequential addition of monomers. The obtained χ(T) dependencies (χMFT = 23.2/T – 0.024 and χFH = 36.0/T – 0.041) are weaker than in the corresponding PI-b-PS system, revealing that the different reactivity ratios of the monomers is not the sole factor that controls the miscibility of the segments in the tapered multiblock copolymers. The latter is controlled by the value of the interaction parameter, the width of the tapered interfaces, and the number of blocks and total molecular weight. Tapered multiblock copolymers undergo a fluctuation-induced first-order transition from the ordered to the disordered state. The domain spacing scales as d ∼ n–⁰.⁸³±⁰.⁰² when compared under a fixed total molecular weight, reflecting the conformational properties of the middle blocks. In addition, the domain spacing depends on molecular weight, as d ∼ N⁰.⁵⁵, revealing stretching of chains and nonideal configurations. These structural features of the tapered multiblock copolymer affected their mechanical properties. Tensile tests showed a dramatic enhancement of the strain at break with a concomitant increase in toughness. These mechanical properties can be fine-tuned by the judicious selection of molecular weight and number of blocks. The state of order (ordered, weakly ordered vs disordered) and proximity to the glass temperature of the hard phase are additional parameters that affect the mechanical response. The improved mechanical properties reflect the enhanced interfacial strength, the latter provided by the configurations of the middle blocks in the copolymers. The influence of methyl group substitution in the para position of styrene is discussed by comparing the self-assembly and thermomechanical properties of the current P(I-co-4MS)ₙ with the P(I-co-PS)ₙ system. We found that the shorter tapered interface in the former is counterbalanced by its lower effective interaction parameter resulting in similar domain spacings.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomposite polymers 3acopolymerization 3acyclohexanes 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3aglass 3aisoprene 3amechanical properties 3amoieties 3amolecular weight 3arheology 3asmall-angle X-ray scattering 3astyrene 3atemperature1 aGrune, Eduard1 aWahlen, Christian1 aMüller, Axel H.

Colony colour varied in different media from white or white with light brown centres which later changed to black or dark to light brown with increase in the age of the fungal cultures. Mostly, the colonies had fluffy or cottony mycelial growth with slight variations and regular to irregular white margin. PDA, PCA, CA and RA produced maximum mycelial growth (90 mm) at 10 DAI (days after inoculation). Minimum growth was observed on SA (69.56 mm) and V₈ juice agar media (55.42 mm) and their difference was statistically significant. Morphological variability among the isolates was studied by comparing their conidial length, breadth and length and breadth of setae and their differences were statistically significant. Biochemical variability among the isolates was based on α- and β-esterase and peroxidise profiling. Positive activity was observed for both α- and β-esterase. α-Esterase enzyme showed the highest enzyme activity in terms of maximum numbers of banding loci among the three isozymes tested. The findings of the present study clearly revealed that cultural, morphological and biochemical variability did exist among the different isolates of C. truncatum.  aPublisher supplied data 3aColletotrichum truncatum 3aanthracnose 3acolor 3aconidia 3aculture media 3aenzyme activity 3aesterases 3afungi 3aisozymes 3alaboratory experimentation 3aloci 3amung beans 3amycelium 0aAntracnose 0agreengram 0acultural 0amorphological and biochemical variability1 aUmbrey, Yashi1 aMahapatra, Sunita1 aDas, Srikanta0 tArchiv für Phytopathologie und Pflanzenschutz.g2019 Jan. 20, v. 52, no. 1-2 p.141-154dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl49030x1477-29067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03235408.2019.15881943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03263naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002500149245010900174300001600283520156400299592002801863596014201891596004102033596004102074650001902115650002202134650001602156650001202172650002002184650001402204650001402218650001302232650001802245650001402263650001302277650001602290650002202306650001202328653002802340653001302368700001702381700001602398700002002414700001902434700002202453700007102475773010702546856008302653852000902736655001202745IND60680922020221119151623.0200110e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068092202DNAL7 a10.1094/PHYTO-07-19-0229-FI2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChowdhury, Rawnaq N.10aHCPro Suppression of Callose Deposition Contributes to Strain-Specific Resistance Against Potato Virus Y  ap. 164-173.  aPotato virus Y (PVY; Potyviridae) is a continuing challenge for potato production owing to the increasing popularity of strain-specific resistant cultivars. Hypersensitive resistance (HR) is one type of plant defense responses to restrict virus spread. In many potato cultivars, such as cultivar Premier Russet (PR), local necrosis at the site of infection protects against the most common PVYᴼ strain, but the HR often fails to restrain necrotic strains, which spread systemically. Here, we established the role of callose accumulation in the strain-specific resistance responses to PVY infection. We first uncovered that PVY, independent of the strain, is naturally capable of suppressing pathogenesis-related callose formation in a susceptible host. Such activity can be dissociated from viral replication by the transient expression of the viral-encoded helper component proteinase (HCPro) protein, identifying it as the pathogen elicitor. However, unlike the necrotic strain, PVYᴼ and its corresponding HCPro are unable to block callose accumulation in resistant PR potatoes, in which we observed an abundance of callose deposition and the inability of the virus to spread. The substitution of eight amino acid residues within the HCPro C-terminal region that differ between PVYᴼ and PVYᴺ strains and were previously shown to be responsible for eliciting the HR response, are sufficient to restore the ability of HCProᴼ to suppress callose accumulation, despite the resistant host background, in line with a new viral function in pathogenicity.  aPublisher supplied data  a58-5090-5-056a58-5090-6-048cU.S. Department of Agriculture–Agricultural Research Service (USDA ARS)/State Cooperative Potato Research  aMSN223905cWisconsin Potato Industry  cNorthwest Potato Research Consortium 3aPotato virus Y 3aSolanum tuberosum 3aamino acids 3acallose 3acrop production 3acultivars 3aelicitors 3anecrosis 3apathogenicity 3apathogens 3apotatoes 3aproteinases 3avirus replication 3aviruses 0agenetics and resistance 0avirology1 aLasky, Danny1 aKarki, Hari1 aZhang, Zongying1 aGoyer, Aymeric1 aHalterman, Dennis1 aRakotondrafara, Aurélie M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1859-37430 tPhytopathology.g2020 Jan., v. 110, no. 1 p.164-173dPhytopathologywJournal:jnl44575x0031-949X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PHYTO-07-19-0229-FI3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03095naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100003300139245013100172300001800303500002000321520145600341592002801797596005201825596005701877650001801934650002501952650001801977650001801995650001802013650002402031650002602055650002402081650000902105650002002114650001502134650001702149650001502166650001802181650002202199650001102221650002202232650001202254650001202266700001802278700002002296700005602316773012302372856007302495852000902568655001202577IND60710981620221122003328.0200915e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071098162DNAL7 a10.1111/are.147502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPedrosa‐Gerasmio, Ivane R.10aGut bacterial community profile in Pacific white shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei following 5‐aminolevulinic acid supplementation  ap. 4075-4086.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aChanges in the diet have been previously reported to alter the gut bacterial profile in several organisms, including shrimp. These shifts in microbial structure either promote beneficial effects to the host or cause diseases. Supplementation of 5‐aminolevulinic acid (5‐ALA), the precursor of tetrapyrroles, has been previously reported to enhance shrimp's immune response. To know whether 5‐ALA has effects on the gut bacterial structure in Pacific white shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei), we investigated the bacterial communities in the intestine and stomach of L. vannamei using high‐throughput Illumina sequencing of 16S rRNA gene libraries. One week of 5‐ALA supplementation altered the bacterial community structure (beta diversity) in both tissues, as shown by the results of multi‐dimensional scaling (MDS) plots and analysis of similarities (ANOSIM). DESeq2 analysis revealed enrichment of differentially abundant taxa in the 5‐ALA group (e.g. Enhydrobacter and Oceaniovalibus) and control group (e.g. Tenacibaculum and Mycobacterium). Metagenomic predictions suggested that the control group had more KEGG pathways associated with ‘metabolism’ than the 5‐ALA group. This study suggests that 5‐ALA supplementation potentially promotes the formation of a beneficial bacterial community structure in shrimp. This is the first report on the effect of 5‐ALA supplementation on the bacterial community profile in any organism.  aPublisher supplied data  aJPMJSA1806cJapan Science and Technology Agency  a19H00949cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science 3aEnhydrobacter 3aLitopenaeus vannamei 3aMycobacterium 3aRNA libraries 3aTenacibaculum 3aaminolevulinic acid 3abacterial communities 3acommunity structure 3adiet 3aimmune response 3aintestines 3ametagenomics 3aprediction 3aribosomal RNA 3asequence analysis 3ashrimp 3aspecies diversity 3astomach 3atissues1 aNozaki, Reiko1 aKondo, Hidehiro1 aHirono, Ikuo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2355-31210 tAquaculture research.g2020 Oct., v. 51, no. 10 p.4075-4086dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl53865x1355-557X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/are.147503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02492naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245009400162300001600256520130400272592002801576650001001604650002501614650001101639650002801650650002801678650001101706650001401717650001601731650004701747650001401794650002601808650002001834650001301854700001301867700001201880773011201892856008102004852000902085655001202094IND60124033620221120062518.0150421e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012403362DNAL7 a10.1007/s11240-014-0705-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Xuemin10aPlant regeneration from protoplasts of Gentiana macrophylla Pall. using agar-pool culture  ap. 345-351.  aAn efficient protocol for plant regeneration was developed from protoplasts of Gentiana macrophylla Pall. through somatic embryogenesis. Viable protoplasts were isolated from cell suspensions derived from young seedling leaves in an enzyme solution containing 2 % Cellulase Onozuka R-10, 0.5 % Macerozyme R-10, 0.5 % Hemicellulase, and 0.4 M sorbitol with a yield of 6.2 × 10⁶ protoplasts g⁻¹fresh weight.

The frequency of protoplast cell divisions and colony formations in aPL culture were significant (p < 0.05) higher than those in liquid and sLD cultures. The highest division frequency and plating efficiency were 37.7 % and 16.5 %, respectively, in aPL culture supplemented with 2 mg l⁻¹2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) and 0.5 mg l⁻¹6-benzylaminopurine (BA). Protoplast-derived microcalli obtained from aPL culture system were transferred to solid MS medium with a reduced concentration of 2,4-D (0.5 mg l⁻¹) to promote the formation of embryogenic calli. Somatic embryos developed into plantlets on MS medium supplemented with 2 mg l⁻¹BA at a rate of 51.3 %.

A demonstration study on cost-effective conversion of fermentable sugars in sweet sorghum stems into ethanol with advanced solid-state fermentation technology is presented in this paper. A continuous solid-state fermenter, which is 55m in length and 3.6m in diameter, is successfully operated in Inner Mongolia, China in 2011. Results show that the retention time (fermentation time) of the solid substrate is less than 30h, and the ethanol yield reaches 90.5% of the theoretical yield. A total of 16ton of sweet sorghum stems (with 13.5% sugar content and 70% moisture) are used to produce 1ton of ethanol (99.5%, v/v). The cost of fuel ethanol production is $615.4per ton (49cent/liter) on the premise that the price of the sweet sorghum stems is $30per ton.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSorghum bicolor 3acost effectiveness 3aenergy costs 3aenergy crops 3aethanol 3aethanol fuels 3aethanol production 3afermenters 3aprices 3asolid state fermentation 3astems 3asugar content 3asugars 3asweet sorghum 3aChina1 aLi, Guangming1 aZhang, Lei1 aZhou, Zhixing1 aHan, Bing1 aHou, Wenhui1 aWang, Jingbing1 aLi, Tiancheng0 tApplied energy.g2013 Feb., v. 102 p.260-265dElsevier Ltdx0306-26197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2012.09.0603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03251naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005200148245018400200300001200384520167200396592002802068596006402096596006902160650001902229650001802248650002302266650002502289650001002314650001702324650001402341650002502355650000702380650002502387650003002412650001402442650001302456650001602469650000902485650001602494700001902510700001902529700001302548773012802561856008302689852000902772655001202781IND60775718320221121211622.0220511e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077571832DNAL7 a10.1007/s00203-022-02867-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXue, Han1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0414-623710aPinirhizobacter soli gen. nov., sp. nov., a novel low temperature resistant gammaproteobacterium in the family Rhodanobacteraceae isolated from rhizospheric soil of Larix gmelinii  ap. 283.  aThree yellow-colored strains, NC2-4-308ᵀ, NC3-4-326 and NA3-4-109, were isolated from the rhizosphere soil of Larix gmelinii in Nanwenghe Nature Reserve, Great Khingan, China. These strains were oxidase- and catalase-positive and Gram-staining-negative. The cells were non-motile short rods that were aerobic and non-spore-forming. Growth occurred at pH values of 5.0–8.0 and at 0–4% (w/v) NaCl. The three strains were resistant to low temperature and grew at 2–35 °C. The principal fatty acids (> 5%) were summed feature 9, iso-C₁₅:₀, iso-C₁₇:₀ and anteiso-C₁₅:₀. The predominant quinone was ubiquinone-8. The polar lipids consisted of phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine, two unidentified phospholipids, three unidentified lipids and three unidentified aminophospholipids. The DNA G + C content of the type species was 64.0 mol%. The 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities among the three strains are more than 99.9%, indicating they belong to the same species. Phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA gene, whole-genome sequences, the low ANI (74.2–75.5%) and dDDH (19.3–20.1%) hybridization values enabled differentiation of strains NC2-4-308ᵀ, NC3-4-326 and NA3-4-109 from the members of related genera. The combined data from the morphological, physiological, biochemical and chemotaxonomic tests indicate the three strains as a novel genus and a novel species in the family Rhodanobacteraceae. Therefore, we propose a novel genus with the name Pinirhizobacter soli gen. nov., sp. nov., for which the type strain is NC2-4-308ᵀ (= CFCC 14693ᵀ = KCTC 72394ᵀ).  aPublisher supplied data  aNIMR-2020-7cnational infrastructure of microbial resources  aGrant NO. 31570603cnational natural science foundation of china 3aLarix gmelinii 3achemotaxonomy 3aconservation areas 3agamma-Proteobacteria 3agenes 3amicrobiology 3anew genus 3anucleotide sequences 3apH 3aphosphatidylcholines 3aphosphatidylethanolamines 3aphylogeny 3aquinones 3arhizosphere 3asoil 3atemperature1 aPiao, Chun-gen1 aWolongtaixian,1 aLi, Yong0 tArchives of microbiology.g2022 May, v. 204, no. 5 p.283-283dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl49610x0302-89337nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00203-022-02867-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02965naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002800147245012100175300001600296500001500312520162000327592002801947650001601975650001601991650001302007650002202020650002502042650002802067650002402095650002602119650001402145650001802159650002002177650001802197650003802215650002002253653001002273700002502283700002102308773011202329856008102441852000902522655001202531IND60124033720221120062427.0150421e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012403372DNAL7 a10.1007/s11240-014-0706-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPérez Sánchez, Marta,10aExpression analysis of epigenetic and abscisic acid-related genes during maturation of Quercus suber somatic embryos  ap. 353-366.  a2019-12-04  aClonal propagation of Quercus suber via somatic embryogenesis is an alternative to conventional tree propagation methods; however, complete maturation of somatic embryos is considered the major bottleneck for mass propagation of Quercus species. During somatic embryogenesis, embryo development and maturation are controlled by signaling pathways that integrate information from genetic and epigenetic programs as well as hormonal signals. Therefore, in this study genes were identified related to epigenetic regulation and the abscisic acid (ABA) pathway during development and maturation of cork oak somatic embryos. A total of eight expressed sequence tags were obtained of genes encoding a 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase (NCED), two histone deacetylases (HDA6 and HDA19), two histone monoubiquitinases (HUB1 and HUB2), a histone H3 kinase (AUR3) as well as genes related to chromatin remodeling processes PICKLE and VP1/ABSCISIC ACID INSENSITIVE 3-LIKE 1 (VAL1). The analysis of the expression patterns of selected genes during different developmental stages indicated that QsNCED3 may play a role in ABA synthesis during embryogenesis. The change in the expression levels for all seven genes associated with epigenetic regulation showed that QsHUB1 and QsHUB2 may have a role in ABA signalling while QsHDA6 and QsHDA19 could act in different pathways than in Arabidopsis.

The goal of this study was to compare the effects of natural αT, synthetic αT, and γT on gene expression in two human cell lines. Human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMC) and endothelial cells (HAEC) were either: (1) treated with 25 μM tocopherols alone, or (2) pretreated with tocopherols prior to a pro‐inflammatory cytokine (tumor necrosis factor‐alpha, TNF‐α) stimulation. The expression of atherosclerosis‐related genes was measured using RT² Profiler PCR arrays. Tocopherol treatments alone did not significantly modulate the expression of genes in unstimulated HASMC or HAEC. TNF‐α stimulation significantly upregulated genes involved with apoptosis and stress response in both cell lines. Pretreating cells with tocopherols did not normalize the gene expression changes induced by TNF‐α. However, αT pretreatments, but not γT pretreatments, attenuated TNF expression in both HASMC and HAEC. These findings suggest that under stimulated conditions, αT modestly modulates the expression of selective genes and that αT may be more anti‐inflammatory than γT.  aPublisher supplied data  cAbbott Nutrition through the Center for Nutrition, Learning, and Memory (CNLM) at the University of Illinois at Urbana‐Champaign  cDivision of Nutritional Sciences Vision 20/20 Grant Program at the University of Illinois at Urbana‐Champaign  aILLU‐698‐915cNational Institute of Food and Agriculture 3aalpha-tocopherol 3aantioxidants 3aapoptosis 3agene expression 3ahuman nutrition 3ahumans 3ainflammation 3anecrosis 3aneoplasms 3asmooth muscle 3astress response 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha1 aKuchan, Matthew J.1 aErdman Jr, John W.0 tLipids.g2019 May, v. 54, no. 5 p.289-299dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl46279x0024-42017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lipd.121493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03535naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100006500145245010100210300002000311520151600331592002801847596007701875596009301952650001502045650001902060650002102079650001802100650001102118650003402129650002102163650001302184653000902197653001002206653002602216653002302242653002602265653001702291700002302308700005902331700006202390700002002452700002502472700005902497700002302556700002202579700002002601700006702621700003902688700002302727773014202750856008002892852000902972655001202981IND60783232320220719000000.0220719e20220628xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078323232DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.2c004012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNguyen, Thi Minh Hong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0772-953410aAssessment of Mobilization Potential of Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances for Soil Remediation  ap. 10030-10041.  aThis study investigated the mobilization of a wide range of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) present in aqueous film-forming foams (AFFFs) in water-saturated soils through one-dimensional (1-D) column experiments with a view to assessing the feasibility of their remediation by soil desorption and washing. Results indicated that sorption/desorption of most of the shorter-carbon-chain PFASs (C ≤ 6) in soil reached greater than 99% rapidly─after approximately two pore volumes (PVs) and were well predicted by an equilibrium transport model, indicating that they will be readily removed by soil washing technologies. In contrast, the equilibrium model failed to predict the mobilization of longer-chain PFASs (C ≥ 7), indicating the presence of nonequilibrium sorption/desorption (confirmed by a flow interruption experiment). The actual time taken to attain 99% sorption/desorption was up to 5 times longer than predicted by the equilibrium model (e.g., ∼62 PVs versus ∼12 PVs predicted for perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) in loamy sand). The increasing contribution of hydrophobic interactions over the electrostatic interactions is suggested as the main driving factor of the nonequilibrium processes. The inverse linear relationship (R² = 0.6, p < 0.0001) between the nonequilibrium mass transfer rate coefficient and the Freundlich sorption coefficient could potentially be a useful means for preliminary evaluation of potential nonequilibrium sorption/desorption of PFASs in soils.  aPublisher supplied data  aNAcDepartment of Health, Queenslanddhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100010230  aSR180100005cDepartment of Education and Trainingdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100000923 3adesorption 3ahydrophobicity 3aloamy sand soils 3amass transfer 3amodels 3aperfluorooctane sulfonic acid 3asoil remediation 3asorption 0aAFFF 0aPFASs 0arate-limited sorption 0acolumn experiments 0acontaminant transport 0asoil washing1 aBräunig, Jennifer1 aKookana, Rai S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0477-32841 aKaserzon, Sarit L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6744-12791 aKnight, Emma R.1 aVo, Hoang Nhat Phong1 aKabiri, Shervin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2269-60751 aNavarro, Divina A.1 aGrimison, Charles1 aRiddell, Nicole1 aHiggins, Christopher P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6220-86731 aMcLaughlin, Michaelq(Michael J.),1 aMueller, Jochen F.0 tEnvironmental science & technology.g2022 June 28, v. 56, no. 14 p.10030-10041dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23339x1520-58517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.2c004013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02308naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245011600160300001600276500002000292520108300312592002801395650002201423650002001445650001601465650001001481650000901491650000901500650002401509650001301533650001301546650001301559700002401572700001901596700002001615700001901635700002201654700002001676773010601696856007501802852000901877655001201886IND60787206220221120023828.0220808e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078720622DNAL7 a10.1002/lipd.121472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIwamoto, Kazuko10aUsing Turmeric Oil as a Solvent Improves the Distribution of Sesamin‐Sesamolin in the Serum and Brain of Mice  ap. 311-320.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAccumulation of amyloid‐β peptide is associated with Alzheimer's dementia. Previously, we reported that sesamin and sesamolin inhibited β‐secretase activity in vitro, and each was transported to the serum and brain in mice after oral administration. However, the bioavailability of sesamin and sesamolin was poor in mice. In this study, we aimed to improve the bioavailability of sesamin and sesamolin. We found that the levels of sesamin and sesamolin in mouse serum and brain were higher after the administration of a mixture of sesame extract and turmeric oil (MST) than those after administering sesame extract alone. Serum sesamin and sesamolin contents in the MST‐treated group were 23‐fold and 15‐fold higher, respectively, than those in the sesame extract‐treated group. Brain sesamin and sesamolin contents in the MST‐treated group were 14‐fold and 11‐fold higher, respectively, than those in the sesame extract‐treated group. These results suggest that turmeric oil is an effective solvent to enhance the bioavailability of sesamin and sesamolin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlzheimer disease 3abioavailability 3ablood serum 3abrain 3amice 3aoils 3aoral administration 3apeptides 3asolvents 3aturmeric1 aMatsumura, Shinichi1 aYoshioka, Yuri1 aYamamoto, Ayami1 aMakino, Shohei1 aMoriyama, Tatsuya1 aZaima, Nobuhiro0 tLipids.g2019 May, v. 54, no. 5 p.311-320dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl46279x0024-42017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lipd.121473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02481naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245008900161300002000250500002000270520131600290592002801606650002001634650003001654650002601684650001801710650001601728650002101744650003301765650001001798650002701808650001101835700001801846700001901864773014101883856007402024852000902098655001202107IND60651741120221119231959.0190712e20151012xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065174112DNAL7 a10.3390/su710137612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSimboli, Alberto10aLife Cycle Assessment of Process Eco-Innovations in an SME Automotive Supply Network  ap. 13761-13776.  aJournal Article  aThe aim of the study presented in this article is to assess, from an environmental standpoint, a set of eco-innovations applied to the production process of an automotive component. The eco-innovations were developed by a supply network of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the framework of a project named “Hi-reach”. The component considered is a motorcycle rear wheel spindle. The conventional version is obtained by machining a single forged steel part. The Hi-reach version is indeed manufactured by joining a shaft to a flange; in addition, conventional surface treatments are replaced by a plasma-enhanced chemical vapour deposition (PECVD) treatment and other machining steps are improved. This process was conceived with the aim of maintaining (or enhancing) the technical performance of the spindle and reducing production costs. A Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) was carried out to compare the two scenarios described. Those eco-innovations resulted in significant improvements of the environmental performance of the analysed component, ranging, on average, between 50% and 70% for the impact indicators considered. Our results also highlight the role of SMEs in promoting process eco-innovations and the increasing relevance of LCA as a tool to support decision making in manufacturing.  aPublisher supplied data 3adecision making 3aenvironmental performance 3alife cycle assessment 3amanufacturing 3amotorcycles 3aproduction costs 3asmall and medium enterprises 3asteel 3asustainable technology 3avapors1 aRaggi, Andrea1 aRosica, Pietro0 tSustainability.g2015 Oct. 12, v. 7, no. 10 p.13761-13776dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su710137613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03819naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001600149245012300165300001600288520175900304592002802063596008302091596005202174596003602226650002902262650001102291650001702302650003102319650001602350650000802366650002602374650001102400650001102411650004202422650001002464650001002474650003302484650001802517650002102535650005202556650001302608650001202621651001102633651001102644653001602655653002902671653001602700653002002716700002102736700002602757700001402783700002402797700002502821700001802846700002602864700002002890700006002910773010702970856008303077852000903160655001203169IND60680922520221119151254.0200110e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068092252DNAL7 a10.1094/PHYTO-07-19-0253-FI2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoy, Avijit10aReassortment of Genome Segments Creates Stable Lineages Among Strains of Orchid Fleck Virus Infecting Citrus in Mexico  ap. 106-120.  aThe genus Dichorhavirus contains viruses with bipartite, negative-sense, single-stranded RNA genomes that are transmitted by flat mites to hosts that include orchids, coffee, the genus Clerodendrum, and citrus. A dichorhavirus infecting citrus in Mexico is classified as a citrus strain of orchid fleck virus (OFV-Cit). We previously used RNA sequencing technologies on OFV-Cit samples from Mexico to develop an OFV-Cit–specific reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) assay. During assay validation, OFV-Cit–specific RT-PCR failed to produce an amplicon from some samples with clear symptoms of OFV-Cit. Characterization of this virus revealed that dichorhavirus-like particles were found in the nucleus. High-throughput sequencing of small RNAs from these citrus plants revealed a novel citrus strain of OFV, OFV-Cit2. Sequence comparisons with known orchid and citrus strains of OFV showed variation in the protein products encoded by genome segment 1 (RNA1). Strains of OFV clustered together based on host of origin, whether orchid or citrus, and were clearly separated from other dichorhaviruses described from infected citrus in Brazil. The variation in RNA1 between the original (now OFV-Cit1) and the new (OFV-Cit2) strain was not observed with genome segment 2 (RNA2), but instead, a common RNA2 molecule was shared among strains of OFV-Cit1 and -Cit2, a situation strikingly similar to OFV infecting orchids. We also collected mites at the affected groves, identified them as Brevipalpus californicus sensu stricto, and confirmed that they were infected by OFV-Cit1 or with both OFV-Cit1 and -Cit2. OFV-Cit1 and -Cit2 have coexisted at the same site in Toliman, Queretaro, Mexico since 2012. OFV strain-specific diagnostic tests were developed.  aPublisher supplied data  a11-8130-1246cDepartment of Agriculture (USDA) APHIS PPQ cooperative agreement  a405cCitrus Research and Development Foundation  a5300-172cCitrus Research Board 3aBrevipalpus californicus 3aCitrus 3aClerodendrum 3aOrchid fleck dichorhavirus 3aOrchidaceae 3aRNA 3adiagnostic techniques 3agenome 3agroves 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3ahosts 3amites 3aplant diseases and disorders 3aplant viruses 3aprotein products 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3ataxonomy 3aviruses 3aBrazil 3aMexico 0aBrevipalpus 0anegative sense RNA virus 0aRhabdovirus 0avirus evolution1 aStone, Andrew L.1 aOtero-Colina, Gabriel1 aWei, Gang1 aBrlansky, Ronald H.1 aOchoa, R.q(Ronald),1 aBauchan, Gary1 aSchneider, William L.1 aNakhla, Mark K.1 aHartung, John S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6274-34810 tPhytopathology.g2020 Jan., v. 110, no. 1 p.106-120dPhytopathologywJournal:jnl44575x0031-949X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PHYTO-07-19-0253-FI3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02923naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245015800161300001600319520149700335592002801832650001701860650001401877650001001891650001401901650001701915650001801932650002101950650001101971650002701982650001502009650003102024650001002055650001702065650002602082650001502108650001702123650002202140650001302162700001502175700001302190700001202203700001702215773011902232856008102351852000902432655001202441IND60124034220221120062544.0150421e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012403422DNAL7 a10.1007/s11274-015-1831-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yuqin10aEnhanced lipid accumulation and biodiesel production by oleaginous Chlorella protothecoides under a structured heterotrophic-iron (II) induction strategy  ap. 773-783.  aA structured heterotrophic-iron (II) induction (HII) strategy was proposed to enhance lipid accumulation in oleaginous Chlorella protothecoides. C. protothecoides subjected to heterotrophic-iron (II) induction achieved a favorable lipid accumulation up to 62 % and a maximum lipid productivity of 820.17 mg/day, representing 2.78-fold and 3.64-fold increase respectively over heterotrophic cultivation alone. HII-induced cells produced significantly elevated levels of 16:0, 18:1Δ⁹, and 18:2Δ⁹,¹²fatty acids (over 90 %). The lipid contents and plant lipid-like fatty acid compositions exhibit the potential of HII-induced C. protothecoides as biodiesel feedstock. Furthermore, 31 altered proteins in HII-induced algal cells were successfully identified. These differentially expressed proteins were assigned into nine molecular function categories, including carbohydrate metabolism, lipid biosynthesis, Calvin cycle, cellular respiration, photosynthesis, energy and transport, protein biosynthesis, regulate and defense, and unclassified. Analysis using the Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes and gene ontology annotation showed that malic enzyme, acyltransferase, and ACP were key metabolic checkpoints found to modulate lipid accumulation in C. protothecoides. The results provided possible applications of HII cultivation strategy in other microalgal species and new possibilities in developing genetic and metabolic engineering microalgae for desirable lipid productivity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCalvin cycle 3aChlorella 3aacids 3abiodiesel 3abiosynthesis 3abiotechnology 3acell respiration 3aenergy 3afatty acid composition 3afeedstocks 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3amalic enzyme 3ametabolic engineering 3amicroalgae 3amicrobiology 3aprotein synthesis 3aproteins1 aMu, Jinxiu1 aChen, Di1 aXu, Hua1 aHan, Fangxin0 tWorld journal of microbiology & biotechnology.g2015 May, v. 31, no. 5 p.773-783dSpringer-Verlagx0959-39937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11274-015-1831-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03026naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245014800164506011700312506007600429520143800505592002801943506003701971650002302008650002702031650002002058650001202078650001902090650001502109650002902124650002102153653001702174653001302191653002702204653002102231653002902252700001602281700001602297700001602313700001602329700001402345773011802359856008202477852000902559655001202568IND60771895820221207113628.0220809e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077189582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.eti.2022.1024892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShi, Guangyu10aExogenous Pseudomonas aeruginosa application improved the phytoremediation efficiency of Lolium multiflorum Lam on Cu–Cd co-contaminated soil  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPot experiments were conducted to explore the effect of Pseudomonas aeruginosa on the phytoremediation efficiency of ryegrass on jointly Cu- and Cd-contaminated soil. P. aeruginosa application promoted the growth of ryegrass, increased the concentration of Cu and Cd in ryegrass, and enhanced the translocation of Cu and Cd from roots to shoots. The biomass of ryegrass in the T7 treatment increased by 43.1% compared to the T1 treatment. Additionally, P. aeruginosa application improved the bioavailability of Cu and Cd. The concentration of Cu and Cd in ryegrass under the T7 treatment was 48.7% and 32.8% higher than that under the T1 treatment, and the removal efficiencies of Cu and Cd from soil under the T7 treatment reached 89.5% and 89.3%, respectively. The subcellular distribution of Cu and Cd in ryegrass indicated that Cu and Cd were mainly distributed in the cell wall and cell-soluble fraction, and a large amount of Cd entered the shoot cell membrane and organelle-containing fraction under 500 mg⋅kg⁻¹P. aeruginosa culture application. Thus, application of 500 mg⋅kg⁻¹P. aeruginosa culture to soil can enhance Cu uptake by ryegrass, and the maximum capacity of ryegrass to absorb Cd from the soil was reached with 50 mg⋅kg⁻¹P. aeruginosa culture application. In light of the above results, P. aeruginosa culture application facilitated the phytoremediation of Cu–Cd co-contaminated soil by ryegrass.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aLolium multiflorum 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3abioavailability 3abiomass 3acell membranes 3acell walls 3aenvironmental technology 3aphytoremediation 0aHeavy metals 0aRyegrass 0aPseudomonas aeruginosa 0aPhytoremediation 0aSubcellular distribution1 aHu, Jiayuan1 aDing, Fanqi1 aLi, Shiqian1 aShi, Weilin1 aChen, Yan0 tEnvironmental technology & innovation.g2022 Aug., v. 27 p.102489-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23259x2352-18647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eti.2022.1024893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01803naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245012400169300001300293520058000306592002800886650001600914650001900930650001800949650002600967650001000993650001001003650002901013650002601042650001801068653001401086653003201100653001201132653001501144700002201159773014201181856008501323852000901408655001201417IND60644792520190918000000.0190522e20190120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064479252DNAL7 a10.1080/03235408.2019.16064902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeena, Mukesh10aRegulation of WRKY genes in plant defence with beneficial fungus Trichoderma: current perspectives and future prospects  ap. 1-17.  aIn various environmental condition plants continually face abiotic and biotic stresses that can cause harmful effects on plants.

In this sense, the regulation of transcriptome through WRKY transcription suggests an intricate signalling system in this beneficial plant–microbe interaction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTrichoderma 3aabiotic stress 3abiotic stress 3aenvironmental factors 3afungi 3agenes 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 3atranscriptome 0aWRKY gene 0aplant–microbe interaction 0adefence 0asignalling1 aSwapnil, Prashant0 tArchiv für Phytopathologie und Pflanzenschutz.g2019 Jan. 20, v. 52, no. 1-2 p.1-17dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl49030x1477-29067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03235408.2019.16064903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03804naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100004100148245007700189300001600266520235200282592002802634650002402662650005002686650002302736650002002759650001302779650001902792650001102811650002302822650001202845650001502857650001002872650001502882650001502897651001102912700003002923700003002953700002902983700002703012700004303039700003003082773014203112856008303254852000903337655001203346IND60775718920221121211701.0220427e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077571892DNAL7 a10.1007/s00484-022-02252-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Oliveira Aparecido, Lucas Eduardo10aCoffee pest severity by agrometeorological models in subtropical climate  ap. 957-969.  aThis study aimed to estimate the number of generations and cycle duration of the southern red mite, coffee berry borer, and coffee leaf miner using the thermal index to assist in controlling these main coffee pests in the state of Paraná, Brazil. The data of maximum and minimum air temperature (°C) and precipitation (mm) of all municipalities in the state from 1984 to 2018 were collected from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration/Prediction of Worldwide Energy Resources (NASA/POWER). The reference evapotranspiration was estimated using the (Camargo Campinas IAC Boletim 116:9, 1971) method and the water balance was calculated using the method of (Thornthwaite C, Mather J (1955) The water balance publications in climatology, 8 (1). DIT, Laboratory of climatology, Centerton, NJ, USA). The basal temperature of each pest minus the average temperature of the years was used to calculate the degrees-day, the duration of the pest cycle, and the number of generations per year. The influence of altitude on the development of coffee pests was measured using the Pearson correlation. The thermal index is able to estimate the damage caused by coffee pests in the state of Pará, Brazil. Coffee pests show greater severity in the north of Paraná, in the regions with the highest temperatures. It is the same region that concentrates most of the coffee production of the state. The results of the life cycle and number of generations were interpolated for the entire state using the kriging method. Coffee pests showed the highest severity in the north region of the state of Paraná, more specifically in the Northwest, North Central, and West Central mesoregions. These regions have concentrated most of the state’s coffee production. Mesoregions with the highest coffee production in the state showed higher susceptibility to coffee pests. Altitude showed a high correlation (r > 0.6) with the cycle variability and number of generations of coffee pests. The average cycles of the coffee berry borer, coffee leaf miner, and southern red mite are 24.13 (± 8.34), 45.64 (± 18.61), and 21.51 (± 3.51) days, respectively. The average annual generation was 16.67 (± 4.77), 9.02 (± 2.75), and 17.32 (± 2.63) generations, for the coffee berry borer, the coffee red mite, and the southern red mite, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHypothenemus hampei 3aNational Aeronautics and Space Administration 3aOligonychus ilicis 3aair temperature 3aaltitude 3abioclimatology 3aenergy 3aevapotranspiration 3akriging 3aleafminers 3amites 3aprediction 3asubtropics 3aBrazil1 aLorençone, Pedro Antonio1 aLorençone, João Antonio1 ade Meneses, Kamila Cunha1 ade Lima, Rafael Fausto1 ada Silva Cabral Moraes, José Reinaldo1 aTorsoni, Guilherme Botega0 tInternational journal of biometeorology.g2022 May, v. 66, no. 5 p.957-969dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl46344x0020-71287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00484-022-02252-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03377naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024001900116024003700135040001800172100001900190245012300209300001400332506007600346520192500422592002802347506003702375650002002412650001802432650001502450650001402465650002302479653002902502653001802531653001602549653001902565653001802584653001402602700001302616700002902629700006602658700002102724773009302745856008402838852000902922655001202931IND60611904920221207115637.0201104e20181101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061190492DNAL7 aPMC64724782pmcid7 a300597692pmid7 a10.1016/j.appet.2018.07.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLoth, Katie A.12aA qualitative exploration into momentary impacts on food parenting practices among parents of pre-school aged children  ap. 35-44.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aFood parenting practices have been identified as a potentially significant correlate of weight status and weight-related behaviors in children. The extent to which food parenting practices fluctuate across time and context is not well known. In particular, situational factors are thought to shape the types of food parenting practices used in the moment, but the nature of those factors remain unclear. In this paper data from interviews with parents (n = 40) of preschoolers was used to: 1) describe parents' day-to-day lived experiences of food parenting within the broad theoretical domains of coercive control, structure and autonomy support; 2) identify salient momentary factors that influence use of these food parenting practices; and 3) understand how these momentary factors impact the use of different types of food parenting practices. The feeding practices described by parents align well with the three overarching themes described within the literature: coercive control, autonomy support, and structure. Parents described using a combination of practices from within each of these domains; they also indicated that their feeding practices were easily influenced by momentary factors that impacted their food parenting within and across eating occasions. For the most part, parents described momentary factors (e.g. schedule changes, parental stress, child behavior) that shifted them away from structure and autonomy support feeding practices, towards indulgent and coercive feeding practices. Researchers should be aware of the likely interplay between different types of feeding practices as well as the potential that momentary factors may shift parents from one type of practice towards another. The use of novel data collection methods, such as ecological momentary assessment, that allow for exploration of food parenting practices as dynamic, rather than static, behaviors should be explored.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3adata collection 3aeating habits 3ainterviews 3aparenting 3apreschool children 0aFood parenting practices 0aChild feeding 0aQualitative 0aDietary intake 0aWeight status 0aMomentary1 aUy, Marc1 aNeumark-Sztainer, Dianne1 aFisher, Jennifer Orlet1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8804-58571 aBerge, Jerica M.0 tAppetite.g2018 Nov. 01, v. 130 p.35-44dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl31756x0195-66637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2018.07.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04807naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245016100167300001800328520185900346536043302205592002802638596009802666596008102764596009802845596010802943596012303051650001403174650002603188650001103214650002403225650001503249650002403264650002703288650001003315650004203325650002903367650001303396650002503409650001503434650002703449650001403476650002603490650001803516650002403534650002203558650001303580650001903593650002103612651001003633653001503643653002503658653001303683653002403696653002203720700001703742700001303759700001603772700001603788700001403804700001803818700001903836773014803855856008504003852000904088655001204097IND60644792620190906000000.0190522e20190824xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064479262DNAL7 a10.1080/03650340.2018.15636852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Zhenhua10aLong-term inorganic fertilizer use influences bacterial communities in Mollisols of Northeast China based on high-throughput sequencing and network analyses  ap. 1331-1340.  aThe effects of chemical fertilizers on soil microbial communities have been well studied in a variety of terrestrial systems. However, the individual effects of N, P, and K fertilizers and their combinations (NP, NK, PK and NPK) on bacterial community structure in black soils have not been fully understood. In this study, we applied Illumina MiSeq sequencing and network analysis targeting 16S rRNA gene to comprehensively characterize the effects of 35 years of these inorganic fertilizers on community diversity and composition in the black soil. The results of α-diversity indices and principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) indicated that the N-addition treatments had larger effects than the others. The network analysis showed that the N fertilizer shifted the network structure, topological roles of individual OTUs and key bacterial populations, contributing to a simple network under the N-fertilizer treatments compared with non-N fertilizers treatments. These findings suggested that N fertilizer reduced the bacterial diversity and simplified the interactions among key bacterial members in Mollisol. The results of this study could provide basis for further researches balancing different N application levels, the bacterial community network and crop yield to maintain the ecosystem function and stability.

Mango seed, which represents between 20-60% of the fruit, has limited food or industrial use in most producing countries and is therefore wasted. The kernel contained in the seed (mango seed kernel: MSK) is a good source of carbohydrates (58-80%), contains moderate quantities of proteins (6-13%) and fat (6-16%). The protein of MSK has a good essential amino acid profile and its oil is a good source of stearic and linoleic acids. However, despite these attributes MSK contains a number of anti-nutritional factors (e.g. tannins, phytate, cyanide, antitrypsin, oxalate and saponins) which limit its utilisation in poultry diets. Amongst these factors, tannins are largely responsible for the poor nutritional value of MSK. Several processing methods have been used to reduce the concentration of anti-nutritional factors in MSK and improve its utilisation by poultry. The following paper reviews the composition (nutrients and anti-nutrients) of MSK, recommendations for its use in poultry diets and processing methods to enhance its utilisation by poultry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMangifera indica 3aamino acid composition 3aantinutritional factors 3acyanides 3adiet 3aessential amino acids 3aingredients 3alinoleic acid 3amangoes 3anutrients 3anutritive value 3aoils 3aoxalates 3aphytic acid 3apoultry 3aprocessing technology 3aproteins 3apulp 3asaponins 3aseeds 3atannins 3atropics 0amango seed kernel 0anutritive value 0aanti-nutritional factors 0aprocessing 0apoultry feeding0 tWorld's poultry science journal.g2014 June, v. 70, no. 2 p.279-288dCambridge University Press on behalf of World&#x0027;s Poultry Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45575x1743-47777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00439339140002943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03915naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006500140245015000205300001600355500002000371520177900391592002802170596003502198596006402233596006602297650002002363650001702383650002002400650002102420650001902441650001302460650004102473650002202514650004002536650001002576650001502586650001802601650001802619650001802637650000902655650002102664700002302685700002502708700002102733700002302754700002102777700002702798700002102825700002702846700002402873700002602897700002902923700002802952700002602980700002103006700002003027700002503047773010903072856007503181852000903256655001203265IND60787206520221117171054.0220808e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078720652DNAL7 a10.1002/lipd.121552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ada Silva, Jeferson L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9400-722410aAerobic Training in Young Men Increases the Transfer of Cholesterol to High Density Lipoprotein In Vitro: Impact of High Density Lipoprotein Size  ap. 381-388.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aExercise training not only improves the plasma lipid profile but also reduces risk of developing coronary heart disease. We investigate whether plasma lipids and high density lipoprotein (HDL) metabolism are affected by aerobic training and whether the high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL‐C) levels at baseline influence exercise‐induced changes in HDL. Seventy‐one male sedentary volunteers were evaluated and allocated in two subgroups, according to the HLD‐C levels (< or >40 mg/dL). Participants underwent an 18‐week aerobic training period. Blood was sampled before and after training for biochemical analysis. Plasma lipids, apolipoproteins, HDL diameter, and VO₂ peak were determined. Lipid transfers to HDL were determined in vitro by incubating plasma samples with a donor lipid artificial nanoemulsion. After the 18‐week period of aerobic training, the VO₂ peak increased, while the mean body mass index (BMI) decreased. HDL‐C concentration was higher after the training period, but low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) and non‐HDL‐C did not change. The transfer of esterified cholesterol and phospholipids was greater after exercise training, but the triacylglycerol and unesterified cholesterol transfers were unchanged. The HDL particle diameter increased after aerobic training in all participants. When the participants were separated in low‐HDL and normal‐HDL groups, the postaerobic exercise increment in HDL‐C was higher in the low‐HDL group, while the transfer of esterified cholesterol was lower. In conclusion, aerobic exercise training increases the lipid transfers to HDL, as measured by an in vitro method, which possibly contributes to the classical elevation of the HDL‐C associated with training.  aPublisher supplied data  cSão Paulo Research Foundation  cNational Institute of Science and Technology Complex Fluids  cNational Council for Scientific and Technological Development 3aapolipoproteins 3ablood lipids 3abody mass index 3acoronary disease 3aesterification 3aexercise 3ahigh density lipoprotein cholesterol 3alipid composition 3alow density lipoprotein cholesterol 3amales 3ametabolism 3ananoemulsions 3aparticle size 3aphospholipids 3arisk 3atriacylglycerols1 aMaranhão, Raul C.1 aSilva, Michelle S.M.1 aDias, Rodrigo G.1 aFreitas, Fatima R.1 aBolani, Wladimir1 aLemos Junior, José R.1 aAlves, Cleber R.1 aOliveira, Patrícia A.1 aAlves, Guilherme B.1 aOliveira, Edilamar M.1 aNegrão, Carlos Eduardo,1 aKrieger, José Eduardo,1 aPereira, Alexandre C.1 aSilva, Gisele A.1 aSouza, José P.1 aVinagre, Carmen G.C.0 tLipids.g2019 June, v. 54, no. 6-7 p.381-388dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl46279x0024-42017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lipd.121553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02767naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245008300174300001400257520154300271592002801814650001201842650001501854650001701869650001701886650001101903650002001914650003001934650001201964650002301976650001601999650001002015650000902025650002002034650001902054650000902073650001902082650001002101700001902111700001802130773007802148856008602226852000902312655001202321IND60084982020221119164334.0141101e201302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008498202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2012.08.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKravanja, Philipp10aHeat integration of biochemical ethanol production from straw – A case study  ap. 32-43.  aEthanol produced from lignocellulosic biomass is a desired, renewable fuel that can help to reduce our dependence on oil. In order to achieve the commercial deployment of this fuel good economic and environmental performance are mandatory. Both these targets are tackled by the efficient use of process heat. This work deals with the heat integration of the biochemical production of ethanol from straw. Process simulation and pinch analysis are applied to investigate a base case design of the production process. The energy intensive unit operations distillation and evaporation are in the focus of this pinch analysis. Pressure and heat load modifications of these sections are applied to improve the process design. For this improved process design a heat exchanger network is synthesized. Energy stream and pinch analysis revealed that process residues easily suffice to provide the investigated process with heat. The design modifications of the distillation and evaporation sections lead to increased heat integration. Consequently, a 15% reduction of the utility targets compared to the base case is obtained in the improved design. The heat exchanger network for the improved design is simple, yet the increase in utility consumption compared to the utility targets is quite modest. As a result, in the network only 51% of waste biomass suffice to provide the process with heat. The exceeding biomass can be used for the recovery of energy or material by-products, which highlights the need for efficient polygeneration concepts.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3abyproducts 3acase studies 3adistillation 3aenergy 3aenergy recovery 3aenvironmental performance 3aethanol 3aethanol production 3aevaporation 3afuels 3aheat 3aheat exchangers 3alignocellulose 3aoils 3aprocess design 3astraw1 aModarresi, Ala1 aFriedl, Anton0 tApplied energy.g2013 Feb., v. 102 p.32-43dElsevier Ltdx0306-26197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2012.08.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02101naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245009600155300001600251520102100267592002801288650001601316650002901332650002001361650001201381650001501393650001301408650001101421650001101432650001101443700001701454700001801471700001601489700001501505773012501520856007301645852000901718655001201727IND60466723420221122033056.0151127e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6046672342DNAL7 a10.1111/fme.121422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLagarde, R.10aUpstream migration of amphidromous gobies of La Réunion Island: implication for management  ap. 437-449.  aDiadromous species of tropical islands face numerous anthropogenic disturbances. Understanding how these disturbances affect the population dynamic of these species is important to develop ecologically based management measures. The upstream migration dynamics of two amphidromous gobies, Sicyopterus lagocephalus (Pallas) and Cotylopus acutipinnis (Guichenot), was described using intensive fishway monitoring (28 sampling dates over 1.5 years, 13 000 S. lagocephalus, 23 000 C. acutipinnis captured). Migration peak occurred for both species during the afternoon at the end of austral winter/beginning of austral summer. Abundance and size of fish caught in the river showed a marked impact of a dam (six sampling dates approximately 4000 individuals of each species captured). This study provides critical data for better management of fishways used by tropical amphidromous gobies. It appears especially important to reduce unwanted rheotactic sources that attract the fish away from the fishway's entrance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSicyopterus 3aanthropogenic activities 3adiadromous fish 3aislands 3amonitoring 3araceways 3arivers 3asummer 3awinter1 aTeichert, N.1 aBoussarie, G.1 aGrondin, H.1 aValade, P.0 tFisheries management and ecology.g2015 Dec., v. 22, no. 6 p.437-449dBlackwell Scientific Publicationsx0969-997X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fme.121423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03613naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245010400172300001800276520141800294536025401712592002801966596006901994596004702063596006202110650001902172650002002191650002502211650001202236650001202248650001102260650001002271650001302281650001702294650002102311650001802332650001102350650001002361650002502371650001302396650001602409650002202425650001902447650002202466650001202488653003302500653001902533653002702552700001802579700002402597700002302621700003302644700002502677700002002702700002302722773014802745856008502893852000902978655001202987IND60644792720190906000000.0190522e20190824xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064479272DNAL7 a10.1080/03650340.2018.15649072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTorres, Nazareth10aPotential biomedical reuse of vegetative residuals from mycorrhized grapevines subjected to warming  ap. 1341-1353.  aGrapevine leaves are widely discarded in open fields despite their known antioxidant properties. We tested the cytotoxicity of leaf extracts from three clones (CL-260, CL-1048, CL-8) of Vitis vinifera L. cv. Tempranillo against four human cancer cell lines: colon, HT-29; breast, MCF-7; lung HTB-54; and lymphoblastic leukemia, CCRF-CEM. Grapevines were cultivated at either ambient (24/14 °C) or elevated (28/18 °C) day/night temperatures, and inoculated (+M) or not (-M) with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). Cytotoxicity was analysed by MTT assays. Elevated air temperatures enhanced the cytotoxicity of leaf extracts from CL-260 against HT-29, CCRF-CEM and HTB-54 and that from CL-8 against MCF-7. Mycorrhization improved the cytotoxicity of leaf extracts from CL-1048 against HT-29, CCRF-CEM, HTB-54 and MCF-7. The cytotoxic activities of CL-260 against HTB-54 and CL-1048 against HT-29 were correlated, respectively, with total phenols and total antioxidant capacity. We conclude that the predicted increase in air temperature for the future climate and the mycorrhizal association of grapevines may enhance the cytotoxicity of leaves, which strengthens the potential application of these agricultural residuals for biomedicine.

In this experiment, we investigated the possibility of reducing nitrate accumulation in onion bulb by application of Ni. Two onion cultivars (Allium cepa L. cvs. Dorrcheh and Cebolla Valenciana) were supplied with three levels of Ni (0, 25, and 50 µM) in the form of synthetic Ni–histidine complex [Ni(His)₂] and NiCl₂. Addition of Ni significantly increased fresh bulb mass of onion cultivars. In ‘Valenciana’, increasing Ni concentration from 25 to 50 µM reduced fresh bulb mass while in ‘Dorrcheh’, no significant difference was found between 25 and 50 µM Ni treatments. Supplement with Ni resulted in lower accumulation of nitrate in onion bulb. This reduction was associated with higher activity of nitrate reductase (NR) and glutamine synthetase (GS). Onion plants supplied with Ni had higher concentration of ammonium and total N in their bulb compared with those unsupplied with Ni. The [Ni(His)₂] complex was more effective than NiCl₂in improving yield, stimulating activity of NR and GS, and reducing nitrate concentration in onion. According to the results obtained, application of 25 µM Ni particularly in the form of [Ni(His)₂] can be effective in reducing nitrate accumulation and enhancing health quality of onion.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAllium cepa 3abulbs 3acultivars 3aglutamate-ammonia ligase 3ahistidine 3ahuman health 3anickel 3anitrate reductase 3anitrates 3anitrogen metabolism 3anutrition 3aonions1 aKhoshgoftarmanesh, A.

The use of local intermediaries has been considered as one possibility for improving the environmental effectiveness of such programs. German Landcare Associations (LCAs) have been identified as one intermediary that holds the potential to positively influence the implementation of agri-environmental measures (AEMs). This paper empirically assesses the involvement of LCAs in the context of AEM implementation in Germany. An online questionnaire was distributed to all LCAs in Germany. In a first step, we examine if LCAs (1) provide social networks between stakeholders and (2) provide agri-environmental information and assistance to farmers. In a second step, the LCAs assess (3) their perception of how strongly their work influences farmers’ participation in PES schemes and (4) if they pursue the spatial targeting of AEMs. In a third step, we relate the relative level of social networks and the provision of agri-environmental information and assistance to their stated influence on farmers’ participation in and spatial targeting of AEMs. Finally we derive overall conclusions on how intermediaries can enhance the effectiveness of PES programs in general.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagri-environmental policy 3aecosystem services 3afarmers 3aquestionnaires 3asocial networks 3astakeholders 3aGermany1 aMatzdorf, Bettina1 aMeyer, Claas1 aSattler, Claudia0 tSustainability.g2015 Oct. 15, v. 7, no. 10 p.13856-13886dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su710138563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03390naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245013500163506011700298506007600415520149800491592002801989506003702017650001502054650002402069650002002093650002202113650000902135650003102144650002902175650001302204650001602217650001802233650001102251650001302262650000702275650001802282650002502300650003202325650001702357650001502374650001302389650002302402650001702425650001602442653001802458653001602476653001502492653003002507700002202537700001802559700001402577773011802591856008202709852000902791655001202800IND60771896120221207113629.0220809e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077189612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.eti.2022.1024952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDu, Hailing10aAdsorption of rhodamine B on polyvinyl chloride, polystyrene, and polyethylene terephthalate microplastics in aqueous environments  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aRhodamine B (RhB), widely used as a tracer and colorant, is highly toxic, carcinogenic, and mutagenic to humans and organisms. Microplastics (MPs) could accumulate RhB in the aquatic environment, increasing their potential environmental risks. In this study, the interaction between RhB and MPs (polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polystyrene (PS), and polyethylene terephthalate (PET)) were thoroughly investigated, and the effects of pH, salinity, humic acid, particle size, and temperature were explored. The adsorption capacity of RhB on MPs followed the order PVC > PS > PET. The pH significantly influenced the adsorption of RhB on MPs. The presence of Na+ and humic acid could compete with RhB for adsorption sites. High temperature promoted the adsorption of RhB on PVC but inhibited that of PS and PET. The adsorption process could be well described by the pseudo-second-order model and Langmuir model, indicating that the adsorption was monolayer chemisorption. The adsorption capacity of RhB varies with MPs depended on the specific surface area, crystallinity, glassy state, and functional groups of MPs. Electrostatic interaction was a crucial factor in the adsorption of RhB on MPs. The adsorption of RhB on PVC was affected by halogen bonding and polar interaction. PS and PET could be combined with RhB through π–π interaction. This study explored the adsorption characteristics of diverse MPs to RhB and provided a theoretical basis for assessing its potential environmental risks.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadsorption 3aaquatic environment 3acarcinogenicity 3acrystal structure 3adyes 3aelectrostatic interactions 3aenvironmental technology 3ahalogens 3ahumic acids 3amicroplastics 3amodels 3amutagens 3apH 3aparticle size 3apoly(vinyl chloride) 3apolyethylene terephthalates 3apolystyrenes 3arhodamines 3asalinity 3asorption isotherms 3asurface area 3atemperature 0aMicroplastics 0aRhodamine B 0aAdsorption 0aElectrostatic interaction1 aZhang, Yingshuang1 aJiang, Hongru1 aWang, Hui0 tEnvironmental technology & innovation.g2022 Aug., v. 27 p.102495-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23259x2352-18647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eti.2022.1024953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01291naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245005400158300001800212500001900230520033500249592002800584650001400612650001000626650001400636650001100650700001900661700001400680700001100694700001300705700001700718773013500735856007400870852000900944655001200953IND60661460420221120113102.0190829e20190827xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066146042DNAL7 a10.1039/c8cs00960k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarrow, A.

To compare the hepatotoxicity of H-PFMO2OSA with legacy perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), male adult mice were exposed to 0.2, 1, or 5 mg/kg/d of each chemical for 28 days. Results showed that, although H-PFMO2OSA liver and serum concentrations were lower than those of PFOS, the relative liver weight in the H-PFMO2OSA groups was significantly higher than that in the corresponding PFOS groups. In addition, the increase in alanine transaminase and aspartate aminotransferase activity was greater in the H-PFMO2OSA groups than in the PFOS groups. Reduced glutathione (GSH) content and glutathione reductase activity in the liver increased in the 1 and 5 mg/kg/d H-PFMO2OSA groups and in the 5 mg/kg/d PFOS group. Liver quantitative proteome analysis demonstrated that, similar to PFOS, H-PFMO2OSA caused lipid metabolism disorder, and most lipid metabolism-related differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were controlled by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα). Additionally, KEGG enrichment analysis highlighted changes in the GSH metabolism pathway after PFOS and H-PFMO2OSA exposure. Then, there were eight DEPs involved in the GSH metabolism pathway that mostly were upregulated after exposure to H-PFMO2OSA but not after exposure to PFOS. In conclusion, H-PFMO2OSA induced higher levels of liver damage and more serious GSH metabolism dysregulation compared to PFOS.  aPublisher supplied data  a21737004cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a21777160cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809 3aadults 3aalanine transaminase 3aaspartate transaminase 3ablood serum 3abyproducts 3aenvironmental science 3agene expression regulation 3aglutathione 3aglutathione-disulfide reductase 3ahepatotoxicity 3alipid metabolism disorders 3alipids 3aliver 3amales 3aperfluorocarbons 3aperfluorooctane sulfonic acid 3aperoxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha 3aproteome 3asulfonic acids 3atechnology 0aperfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) 0aNafion byproduct 2 (H-PFMO2OSA) 0alipid metabolism 0aglutathione metabolism1 aYao, Jingzhi1 aGuo, Hua1 aSheng, Nan1 aGuo, Yong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5534-00911 aDai, Jiayin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4908-55970 tEnvironmental science & technology.g2022 July 04, v. 56, no. 14 p.10183-10192dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23339x1520-58517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.2c009573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02599naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245006000161300002000221500002000241520149500261592002801756650001701784650002601801650001101827650002201838650001201860650001401872651001001886651002501896700002001921700002001941700001901961700002101980773014102001856007402142852000902216655001202225IND60651741620221119232021.0190712e20151015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065174162DNAL7 a10.3390/su710138872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAgnoletti, Mauro10aFeatures Analysis of Dry Stone Walls of Tuscany (Italy)  ap. 13887-13903.  aJournal Article  aTerraced systems currently represent an indubitable added value for Tuscany, as well as for other Italian regions and for several Mediterranean countries. This value goes beyond their original function of hosting new areas for cultivation. The hydrological functions performed by these systems, including control of erosion, stabilisation of the slopes, prolongation of runoff times and the possible reduction of the volumes of surface runoff, are well-known. In addition, they also play a strategic role in the conservation of biodiversity and in maintaining local identity. At a national level, the terraced agricultural systems fall within the scope of actions scheduled in the National Strategic Plan for Rural Development 2007–2013, and the standards of Good Agricultural and Environmental Conditions (GAECs) envisages that they be maintained through the granting of economic aid as laid down in the Rural Development Plans 2007–2013 and 2014–2020. Eighteen sample areas, previously selected on the basis of the terracing intensity index (defined as the ratio between the lines representing the walls and the surface of 1 ha), were subjected for on-site surveys to determine the geo-typological features through the identification and measurement of the main technical-construction parameters of the dry stone walls. This analysis also enabled assessments of the overall state of conservation of the dry stone walls in order to suggest operations for safeguarding and protection.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3aenvironmental factors 3arunoff 3arural development 3asurveys 3aterracing 3aItaly 3aMediterranean region1 aConti, Leonardo1 aFrezza, Lorenza1 aMonti, Massimo1 aSantoro, Antonio0 tSustainability.g2015 Oct. 15, v. 7, no. 10 p.13887-13903dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su710138873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02925naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002500149245007100174300001400245520129400259592002801553596005201581596008901633650000801722650000801730650002101738650002201759650001301781650001001794650002601804650001201830650001701842650001901859650001001878650001901888650001101907650001501918650002101933650001301954650001201967653001501979653002801994653001802022653002002040653002102060700002002081700002002101700006502121773010502186856008302291852000902374655001202383IND60680922820221119151649.0200110e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068092282DNAL7 a10.1094/PHYTO-07-19-0267-IA2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKalinina, Natalia O.10aCRISPR Applications in Plant Virology: Virus Resistance and Beyond  ap. 18-28.  aClustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated genes (Cas) is a prokaryotic adaptive immune system which has been reprogrammed into a precise, simple, and efficient gene targeting technology. This emerging technology is revolutionizing various areas of life sciences, medicine, and biotechnology and has raised significant interest among plant biologists, both in basic science and in plant protection and breeding. In this review, we describe the basic principles of CRISPR/Cas systems, and how they can be deployed to model plants and crops for the control, monitoring, and study of the mechanistic aspects of plant virus infections. We discuss how Cas endonucleases can be used to engineer plant virus resistance by directly targeting viral DNA or RNA, as well as how they can inactivate host susceptibility genes. Additionally, other applications of CRISPR/Cas in plant virology such as virus diagnostics and imaging are reviewed. The review also provides a systemic comparison between CRISPR/Cas technology and RNA interference approaches, the latter of which has also been used for development of virus-resistant plants. Finally, we outline challenges to be solved before CRISPR/Cas can produce virus-resistant crop plants which can be marketed.  aPublisher supplied data  a14.W03.31.000cGovernment of Russian Federation  cScottish Government Rural and Environmental Science and Analytical Services Division 3aDNA 3aRNA 3aRNA interference 3aadaptive immunity 3abreeding 3acrops 3adiagnostic techniques 3aenzymes 3agene editing 3agene targeting 3agenes 3aimage analysis 3amodels 3amonitoring 3aplant protection 3avirology 3aviruses 0aCRISPR/Cas 0agenetics and resistance 0aplant viruses 0avirus detection 0avirus resistance1 aKhromov, Andrey1 aLove, Andrew J.1 aTaliansky, Michael E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6499-64390 tPhytopathology.g2020 Jan., v. 110, no. 1 p.18-28dPhytopathologywJournal:jnl44575x0031-949X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PHYTO-07-19-0267-IA3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03071naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245013500165300001600300520165900316592002801975650001402003650001702017650001802034650002202052650001302074650001102087650001502098650002102113650001202134650001002146650002302156650004302179650002202222650001602244650000902260650001402269650001402283650001102297650001902308650001302327700002202340700001802362773011902380856008102499852000902580655001202589IND60124034620221120053145.0150421e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012403462DNAL7 a10.1007/s11274-015-1835-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aElmi, Fatemeh12aA novel metabolite (1,3-benzenediol, 5-hexyl) production by Exophiala spinifera strain FM through dibenzothiophene desulfurization  ap. 813-821.  aSulfur dioxide which is released from petroleum oil combustion causes pollution over the atmosphere and the soil. Biodesulfurization can be used as a complementary method of hydrodesulfurization, the common method of petroleum desulfurization in refineries. Many studies have been carried out to develop biological desulfurization of dibenzothiophene (DBT) with bacterial biocatalysts. However, fungi are capable to metabolize a wide range of aromatic hydrocarbons through cytochrome P450 and their extracellular enzymes. The aim of the present work was isolation and identification of fungi biocatalysts capable for DBT utilization as sulfur source and production of novel metabolites. DBT consumption and the related produced metabolites were analyzed by HPLC and GC–MS respectively. One of the isolated fungi that could utilize DBT as sole sulfur source was identified by both traditional and molecular experiments and registered in NCBI as Exophiala spinifera FM strain (accession no. KC952672). This strain could desulfurize 99 % of DBT (0.3 mM) as sulfur source by co-metabolism reaction with other carbon sources through the same pathway as 4S and produced 2-hydroxy biphenyl (2-HBP) during 7 days of incubation at 30 °C and 180 rpm shaking. However, the isolate was able to transform 2-HBP to 1,3-benzenediol, 5-hexyl. While biphenyl compounds are toxic to leaving cells, biotransformation of them can reduce their toxicity and the fungi will be more tolerant to the final product. These data are the first report about the desulfurization of DBT comparable to 4S-pathway and production of innovative metabolite by E. spinifera FM strain.  aPublisher supplied data 3aExophiala 3abiocatalysts 3abiotechnology 3abiotransformation 3abiphenyl 3acarbon 3acombustion 3acytochrome P-450 3aenzymes 3afungi 3agas chromatography 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3ametabolites 3aoils 3apetroleum 3apollution 3asulfur 3asulfur dioxide 3atoxicity1 aEtemadifar, Zahra1 aEmtiazi, Giti0 tWorld journal of microbiology & biotechnology.g2015 May, v. 31, no. 5 p.813-821dSpringer-Verlagx0959-39937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11274-015-1835-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02719naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245011400160300001600274520133100290592002801621650001801649650002101667650002301688650001701711650001901728650002501747650001201772650001801784650001101802650001501813650001001828650002301838650001701861650001401878650001601892650001801908650001001926650000901936650001301945651001001958700001301968700001801981700001701999773011902016856008102135852000902216655001202225IND60124034720221120042124.0150421e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012403472DNAL7 a10.1007/s11274-015-1836-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Yin10aArchaeal communities associated with roots of the common reed (Phragmites australis) in Beijing Cuihu Wetland  ap. 823-832.  aThe richness, phylogeny and composition of archaeal community associated with the roots of common reed (Phragmites australis) growing in the Beijing Cuihu Wetland, China was investigated using a 16S rDNA library. In total, 235 individual sequences were collected, and a phylogenetic analysis revealed that 69.4 and 11.5 % of clones were affiliated with the Euryarchaeota and the Crenarchaeota, respectively. In Euryarchaeota, the archaeal community was dominated by species in following genera: Methanobacterium in the order Methanobacteriales (60.7 %); Methanoregula and Methanospirillum in the order Methanomicrobiales (20.2 %), and Methanomethylovorans, Methanosarcina and Methanosaeta in the order Methanosarcinales (17.2 %). Of 27 sequences assigned to uncultured Crenarchaeota, 22 were grouped into Group 1.3, and five grouped into Group 1.1b. Hence, the archaeal communities associated with reed roots are largely involved in methane production, and, to a lesser extent, in ammonia oxidization. Quantification of the archaeal amoA gene indicated that ammonia oxidizing archaea were more numerous in the rhizosphere soil than in the root tissue or surrounding water. A total of 19.1 % of the sequences were unclassified, suggesting that many unidentified archaea are probably involved in the reed wetland ecosystem.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCrenarchaeota 3aMethanobacterium 3aMethanomicrobiales 3aMethanosaeta 3aMethanosarcina 3aPhragmites australis 3aammonia 3abiotechnology 3aclones 3aecosystems 3agenes 3amethane production 3amicrobiology 3aphylogeny 3arhizosphere 3aribosomal DNA 3aroots 3asoil 3awetlands 3aChina1 aLi, Hong1 aLiu, Qun Fang1 aLi, Yan Hong0 tWorld journal of microbiology & biotechnology.g2015 May, v. 31, no. 5 p.823-832dSpringer-Verlagx0959-39937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11274-015-1836-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02726naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002600149245010100175300001400276520108400290592002801374596008601402650001501488650001601503650001901519650001701538650001501555650001601570650001901586650001601605650002001621650002201641650001201663650001801675650002301693650001201716653001801728653001701746653003001763653001901793653003001812653001301842653001501855700001701870700005801887700006601945773010502011856008302116852000902199655001202208IND60680923020221119151827.0200110e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068092302DNAL7 a10.1094/PHYTO-07-19-0273-FI2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFiallo-Olivé, Elvira10aTransmission of Begomoviruses and Other Whitefly-Borne Viruses: Dependence on the Vector Species  ap. 10-17.  aMost plant viruses require a biological vector to spread from plant to plant in nature. Among biological vectors for plant viruses, hemipteroid insects are the most common, including phloem-feeding aphids, whiteflies, mealybugs, planthoppers, and leafhoppers. A majority of the emerging diseases challenging agriculture worldwide are insect borne, with those transmitted by whiteflies (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae) topping the list. Most damaging whitefly-transmitted viruses include begomoviruses (Geminiviridae), criniviruses (Closteroviridae), and torradoviruses (Secoviridae). Among the whitefly vectors, Bemisia tabaci, now recognized as a complex of cryptic species, is the most harmful in terms of virus transmission. Here, we review the available information on the differential transmission efficiency of begomoviruses and other whitefly-borne viruses by different species of whiteflies, including the cryptic species of the B. tabaci complex. In addition, we summarize the factors affecting transmission of viruses by whiteflies and point out some future research prospects.  aPublisher supplied data  aAGL2016-75819-C2-2-RcMinisterio de Economía, Industria y Competitividad (Spain) 3aAphidoidea 3aBegomovirus 3aBemisia tabaci 3aCicadellidae 3aCrinivirus 3aFulgoroidea 3aPseudococcidae 3aSecoviridae 3acryptic species 3aemerging diseases 3ainsects 3aplant viruses 3avirus transmission 3aviruses 0abegomoviruses 0acriniviruses 0adifferential transmission 0atorradoviruses 0aTrialeurodes vaporariorum 0avirology 0awhiteflies1 aPan, Li-Long1 aLiu, Shusheng,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7711-64051 aNavas-Castillo, Jesús1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8616-62410 tPhytopathology.g2020 Jan., v. 110, no. 1 p.10-17dPhytopathologywJournal:jnl44575x0031-949X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PHYTO-07-19-0273-FI3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02199naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245011700166300001600283520099100299592002801290650002101318650002501339650001801364650001901382650002501401650001301426650001001439650002501449650002101474650001701495650001301512650001901525700001801544700001501562700001501577773011901592856008101711852000901792655001201801IND60124034920221120042149.0150421e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012403492DNAL7 a10.1007/s11274-015-1804-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLing, Chunfang10aApproaches for the generation of active papain-like cysteine proteases from inclusion bodies of Escherichia coli  ap. 681-690.  aPapain-like cysteine proteases are widely expressed, fulfill specific functions in extracellular matrix turnover, antigen presentation and processing events, and may represent viable drug targets for major diseases. In depth and rigorous studies of the potential for these proteins to be targets for drug development require sufficient amounts of protease protein that can be used for both experimental and therapeutic purposes. Escherichia coli was widely used to express papain-like cysteine proteases, but most of those proteases are produced in insoluble inclusion bodies that need solubilizing, refolding, purifying and activating. Refolding is the most critical step in the process of generating active cysteine proteases and the current approaches to refolding include dialysis, dilution and chromatography. Purification is mainly achieved by various column chromatography. Finally, the attained refolded proteases are examined regarding their protease structures and activities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aantigen presentation 3abiotechnology 3achromatography 3acysteine proteinases 3adialysis 3adrugs 3aextracellular matrix 3ainclusion bodies 3amicrobiology 3aproteins 3asolubilization1 aZhang, Junyan1 aLin, Deqiu1 aTao, Ailin0 tWorld journal of microbiology & biotechnology.g2015 May, v. 31, no. 5 p.681-690dSpringer-Verlagx0959-39937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11274-015-1804-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03091naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245011800168300001600286520135600302592002801658650002801686650002501714650001001739650001201749650001501761650001801776650002601794650001301820650001901833650002801852650001801880650002801898650002101926650002001947650001601967650001601983650002201999650001402021650001602035650002302051653002002074653003002094653003702124653002702161653002202188700001702210700002802227700001802255700001602273700001702289773011102306856008702417852000902504655001202513IND60611905620221118073630.0190628e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061190562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2018.06.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Hyunah10aHigh hydrostatic pressure treatment for manufacturing of red bean powder: A comparison with the thermal treatment  ap. 141-147.  aThe traditional process of manufacturing red bean powder (RBP) using high temperature and extensive cooking causes quality changes, such as an off-flavor, destruction of colors, and a reduced nutritional value of the product. In this study, RBP was manufactured using a novel process of wet grinding, high hydrostatic pressure (HHP), and freeze-drying. The impact of HHP treatment in this innovative manufacturing process on the microbial count, antioxidant activity, anti-nutritional factors, and physicochemical properties of RBP was evaluated by comparison with the conventional method of thermal treatment. Microbial populations in final RBP were reduced to 1.83, 1.55, and 1.05 log CFU/g when treated using HHP 400, 500, and 600 MPa, respectively. HHP treatment improved the nutritional profile and reduced the effects of anti-nutritional factors in RBP. The most effective reduction of trypsin inhibitor activity and phytic acid content was achieved using HHP at 600 MPa for 5 min. Total phenols, flavonoids, proanthocyanidins and total antioxidant capacity in HHP treated RBP were more effectively preserved than in thermally treated RBP. Preparation of RBP using a novel manufacturing process involving HHP treatment rather than a thermal treatment improved physico-chemical and functional properties and enhanced microbiological safety.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantinutritional factors 3aantioxidant activity 3acolor 3acooking 3aflavonoids 3afreeze drying 3afunctional properties 3agrinding 3aheat treatment 3ahigh pressure treatment 3amanufacturing 3amicrobiological quality 3anutrient content 3anutritive value 3aoff flavors 3aphytic acid 3aproanthocyanidins 3ared beans 3atemperature 3atrypsin inhibitors 0aRed bean powder 0aHigh hydrostatic pressure 0aInnovative manufacturing process 0aMicrobiological safety 0aNutritional value1 aHa, Min Jung1 aShahbaz, Hafiz Muhammad1 aKim, Jeong Un1 aJang, Holim1 aPark, Jiyong0 tJournal of food engineering.g2018 Dec., v. 238 p.141-147dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34294x0260-87747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2018.06.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02751naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245017700163300001600340520089100356592002801247596010201275596015101377650001801528650004001546650001901586650001401605650002701619650001201646650001301658650002201671650003301693650001701726650001801743650001601761650001201777653002201789653002101811653001101832653001101843653001001854653001301864700001501877700002001892700001201912700001401924700001701938700005601955773010702011856008202118852000902200655001202209IND60680923220221119151648.0200110e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068092322DNAL7 a10.1094/PHYTO-09-19-0328-R2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTuo, Decai12aA Double Mutation in the Conserved Motifs of the Helper Component Protease of Papaya Leaf Distortion Mosaic Virus for the Generation of a Cross-Protective Attenuated Strain  ap. 187-193.  aPotyviral helper component protease (HC-Pro), as a major determinant of symptom expression in susceptible plants, is a likely target candidate in the production of attenuated strains for cross-protection. In this study, single or double mutations of Lys (K) to Glu (E) in the Lys-Ile-Thr-Cys motif and Arg (R) to Ile (I) in the Phe-Arg-Asn-Lys motif of the HC-Pro from the severe papaya leaf distortion mosaic virus strain DF (PLDMV-DF) reduced symptom expression and virus accumulation in infected papaya (Carica papaya) plants. The papaya plants infected with the attenuated double mutant of PLDMV-EI presented as symptomless. PLDMV-EI provided effective protection against PLDMV-DF infection in three papaya cultivars and had no effect on plant growth and development. Our result showed that PLDMV-EI is a promising mild strain for the practical use of cross-protection in the field.  aPublisher supplied data  a2018CXTD343cInnovative Research Team of the Natural Science Foundation of Hainan Province, China  a19CXTD-33a1630052019026cCentral Public Interest Scientific Institution Basal Research Fund for Chinese Academy of Tropical Agricultural Sciences 3aCarica papaya 3aPapaya leaf distortion mosaic virus 3across immunity 3acultivars 3agrowth and development 3amutants 3amutation 3aplant development 3aplant diseases and disorders 3aplant growth 3aplant viruses 3aproteinases 3aviruses 0aattenuated strain 0across-protection 0aHC-Pro 0apapaya 0aPLDMV 0avirology1 aZhou, Peng1 aZhao, Guangyuan1 aYan, Pu1 aTan, Dong1 aLi, Xiaoying1 aShen, Wentao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0231-70900 tPhytopathology.g2020 Jan., v. 110, no. 1 p.187-193dPhytopathologywJournal:jnl44575x0031-949X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PHYTO-09-19-0328-R3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03355naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245009900167300001800266520136600284536018801650592002801838596012201866650001801988650001302006650001302019650001702032650002702049650001002076650002002086650001502106650002502121650001502146650001302161650004402174650001502218650002702233650001202260650001502272650001902287650002002306650001102326653002802337653001502365653002802380653002202408700002102430700002102451700001902472700002102491700002302512773014802535856008502683852000902768655001202777IND60644793420190906000000.0190522e20190824xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064479342DNAL7 a10.1080/03650340.2019.15667132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmeen, Fuad10aPhosphate solubilizing bacteria and fungi in desert soils: species, limitations and mechanisms  ap. 1446-1459.  aDesert soils are infertile, and the ability to improve them by P-fertilization is limited by the solubility of phosphate. We aimed to understand the function of phosphate solubilizing bacteria and the mechanisms behind phosphate solubilization in desert soils. Vegetated and barren desert soils, mine spoil and a fertile temperate grassland loam were sampled. Bacteria and fungi were isolated and identified, and their phosphate-solubilizing abilities were measured in vitro. The release of plant available PO₄, SO₄, NO₃ and NH₄ from desert soils did not compare with that of a grassland soil. Desert soils had substantially lower solubilization than grassland, 162 and 99–121 µg PO₄-P g⁻¹ dry soil, respectively. Phosphate-solubilizing bacteria and fungi were inhabiting the soils. Si addition increased phosphate solubilization of fungi by 50%. The isolated microbes were shown, using ³¹P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis, to rapidly take-up both intracellular and extracellular phosphate during the phosphate solubilizing process. Desert soil had potentially active microbial populations that are capable to solubilize inorganic phosphorus; S and Si as the limiting factors. Acidification as the main mechanism to solubilize mineral phosphate was not as evident in our desert soils as in former studies dealing more fertile soils.  aThe work was funded by the king Abdulaziz city for science & technology and the Deanship of Scientific Research at the King Saud University  through Research group NO (RGP-1438-029).  aPublisher supplied data  aNO (RGP-1438-029)cDeanship of Scientific Research at the King Saud Universitydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100002383 3aacidification 3aammonium 3abacteria 3adesert soils 3afertilizer application 3afungi 3agrassland soils 3agrasslands 3ainorganic phosphorus 3amine spoil 3anitrates 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aphosphates 3aphosphorus fertilizers 3asilicon 3asolubility 3asolubilization 3astable isotopes 3asulfur 0aPhosphate fertilization 0aarid soils 0asustainable agriculture 0abio-fertilization1 aAlYahya, Sami A.1 aAlNadhari, Saleh1 aAlasmari, Hadi1 aAlhoshani, Fahad1 aWainwright, Milton0 tArchiv für Acker- und Pflanzenbau und Bodenkunde.g2019 Aug. 24, v. 65, no. 10 p.1446-1459dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl4585x1476-35677nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03650340.2019.15667133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03711naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024003500132040001800167100006400185245012700249506010400376506007600480506003100556520141600587592002802003596000902031506003702040650002002077650001902097650001502116650001102131650001202142650001402154650001702168650001402185650001102199650001602210650001602226650001502242650002002257650001202277650001502289650003602304650002002340653002602360653001602386653002202402653001602424653002702440700002302467700001902490700006902509700006902578700007502647700005902722700002302781700005902804773009402863856008202957961001303039852000903052655001203061IND60771896820221215143044.0220929e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077189682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dib.2022.1080742chorus7 a10.1016/j.dib.2022.1080742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDiniz, Wellison J.S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1082-553510aDNA methylation dataset of bovine embryonic fibroblast cells treated with epigenetic modifiers and divergent energy supply  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aFetal programming is established early in life, likely through epigenetic mechanisms that control gene expression. Micronutrients can act as epigenetic modifiers (EM) by modulating the genome through mechanisms that include DNA methylation and post-translational modification of chromatin. Among the EM, methionine, choline, folate, and vitamin B₁₂ have been suggested as key players of DNA methylation. However, the effects of supplementing these four EM, involved in the methionine folate cycle on DNA methylation, are still under investigation. This manuscript provides the genome-wide DNA methylation dataset (GSE180362) of bovine embryonic fibroblast cells exposed to different supplementation levels of glucose and methionine, choline, folate, and vitamin B₁₂ (collectively named as Epigenetic Modifiers - EM). The DNA methylation was measured using MSP-I digestion and Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing. Bioinformatics analyses included data quality control, read mapping, methylation calling, and differential methylation analyses. Supplementary file S1 and data analysis codes are within this article. To our knowledge, this is the first dataset investigating the effects of four EM in bovine embryonic fibroblast DNA methylation profiles. Furthermore, this data and its findings provide information on putative candidate genes responsive to DNA methylation due to EM supplementation.  aPublisher supplied data  cUSDA0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA methylation 3abioinformatics 3abisulfites 3acattle 3acholine 3achromatin 3adata quality 3adigestion 3aenergy 3aepigenetics 3afibroblasts 3afolic acid 3agene expression 3aglucose 3amethionine 3apost-translational modification 3aquality control 0aEmbryonic fibroblasts 0aEpigenetics 0aFetal programming 0aMethylation 0aOne-carbon metabolites1 aCrouse, Matthew S.1 aCaton, Joel S.1 aClaycombe-Larson, Kate J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2193-24751 aLindholm-Perry, Amanda K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5555-118X1 aReynolds, L.

A novel vacuolar Na⁺/H⁺exchanger, CiNHX1, was cloned from chicory (Cichorium intybus L.), which contains an open reading frame of 1,644 bp. Sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis indicated that CiNHX shared a great degree of similarity with reported class-I NHX sequences within predicted transmembrane segments and an amiloride-binding domain. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis revealed that salt stress, unlike abscisic acid (ABA) or osmotic stress, greatly induced the expression of CiNHX1, suggesting that CiNHX1 is mainly involved in ABA-independent stress signaling pathways. The fact that chicory accumulated more Na⁺compared to untreated plants under salt stress was concordant to the higher levels of CiNHX mRNA under salinity. A heterologous expression of CiNHX1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant suggested that CiNHX1 could mimic the function of the endogenous NHX1 protein. Subcellular localization assay revealed that CiNHX1 was a tonoplast membrane-localized protein. These results suggested that CiNHX1 plays a critical role in chicory’s tolerance to salinity stress.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCichorium intybus 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aabscisic acid 3achicory 3amessenger RNA 3amutants 3aopen reading frames 3aosmotic stress 3aphylogeny 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asalinity 3asalt stress 3asalt tolerance 3asequence alignment 3asignal transduction 3asodium-hydrogen antiporter 3atonoplast 3avacuoles1 aLin, Manman1 aLin, Zhongyuan1 aZhao, Long1 aZhao, Gengmao1 aLi, Qing1 aYin, Xiangzhen0 tPlant growth regulation.g2015 Apr., v. 75, no. 3 p.605-614dSpringer-Verlagx0167-69037nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10725-014-9963-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02451naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100006700149245007900216300001200295520106400307592002801371650001601399650001901415650001701434650001001451650001301461650001801474650002101492650001401513650001301527650002301540650001201563700006001575700002501635700005801660700006601718700006201784773010301846856008301949852000902032655001202041IND60680923320221119151636.0200110e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068092332DNAL7 a10.1094/PHYTO-10-19-0404-FI2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTatineni, Satyanarayana1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0395-600010aFundamental Aspects of Plant Viruses−An Overview on Focus Issue Articles  ap. 6-9.  aGiven the importance of and rapid research progress in plant virology in recent years, this Focus Issue broadly emphasizes advances in fundamental aspects of virus infection cycles and epidemiology.

It alters the host redox status and confers protection against Sclerotinia sclerotiorum and Rhizoctonia solani. Germin-like proteins (GLPs) are a large, diverse and ubiquitous family of plant glycoproteins belonging to the Cupin super family. These proteins have been widely studied because of their diverse roles in important plant processes, including defence. The novel sunflower gene HaGLP1 encodes the first germin-like protein characterized from the family Asteraceae. To analyse whether constitutive in vivo expression of the HaGLP1 gene may lead to disease tolerance, we developed transgenic Arabidopsis plants that were molecularly characterized and biologically assessed after inoculation with Sclerotinia sclerotiorum or Rhizoctonia solani. HaGLP1 expression in Arabidopsis plants conferred tolerance to S. sclerotiorum at the first stages of disease and interfered with R. solani infection, thus giving rise to significant protection against the latter. Furthermore, HaGLP1 expression in Arabidopsis plants elevated endogenous ROS levels. HaGLP1-induced tolerance does not appear to be related to a constitutive induction of the plant defence or the ROS-related genes examined here. In conclusion, our data suggest that HaGLP1 is an interesting candidate for the engineering of plants with increased fungal tolerance and that this gene could also be useful for the selection of naturally overexpressing sunflower genotypes for conventional breeding purposes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aHelianthus annuus 3aSclerotinia sclerotiorum 3aThanatephorus cucumeris 3abreeding 3adisease resistance 3aengineering 3afungi 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3agenetically modified organisms 3agenotype 3aglycoproteins 3apathogens1 aAlmasia, N.

The chloroformic fungal extract exhibited a good antimicrobial as well as antibiofilm activity against various pathogenic microorganisms. It also demonstrated a good antimutagenicity against the reactive carcinogenic ester generating mutagen, 2-aminofluorene (2-AF) with IC₅₀ values of 0.52 mg ml⁻¹ and 0.36 mg ml⁻¹ in case of co-incubation and pre-incubation, respectively. The antiprolifertive activity against different cancer cell lines; such as HCT-15, HeLa A549 and U87-MG showed the IC₅₀ values of 0.061, 0.065 and 0.072 mg ml⁻¹, respectively. The antioxidant activity of fungal extract has been assessed by 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethyl-benzthiazolin-6-sulfonicacid) (ABTS) methods with IC₅₀ values of 40.07 µg and 54.28 µg, respectively. Total phenolics and flavonoid contents have been also determined. Ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) of fungal extract revealed the presence of various phenolic compounds (caffeic acid, rutin, ellagic acid, quercetin and kaempferol). Further an attempt has been made to purify the bioactive compounds by column chromatography and GC–MS analysis. The above studies demonstrated a good bioactive potential of endophytic fungus Aspergillus fumigatus and shows the pharmacological importance of an endophytic fungus and justify the need to carry out further studies.  aPublisher supplied data  a899-901/Estt./A-11 Dated 13-1-16cUniversity Grants Commission 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aAspergillus fumigatus 3aMoringa oleifera 3aantimicrobial properties 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3acaffeic acid 3acarcinogenicity 3aellagic acid 3aendophytes 3afungi 3akaempferol 3amolecular biology 3amutagens 3aneoplasm cells 3aquercetin 3arutin 3aultra-performance liquid chromatography1 aArora, Daljit Singh1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7711-86381 aKalia, Namarta1 aManpreet Kaur,0 tMolecular biology reports.g2020 Apr., v. 47, no. 4 p.2901-2911dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl5510x0301-48517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11033-020-05394-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02583naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006100150245014500211300002000356520119700376592002801573650002101601650001301622650002001635650002601655650001301681650001101694650001401705700002201719700006101741700006501802700006601867700007201933773012202005856008502127852000902212655001202221IND60759834720221122033921.0211214e20211115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075983472DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.macromol.1c019192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHebner, Tayler S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2723-383510aPolymer Network Structure, Properties, and Formation of Liquid Crystalline Elastomers Prepared via Thiol–Acrylate Chain Transfer Reactions  ap. 11074-11082.  aLiquid crystalline elastomers (LCEs) are functional materials whose stimuli response is strongly influenced by the composition and structure of the polymer network. LCEs are commonly fabricated by copolymerizing acrylate monomers with thiols. This work explores the formation of LCE polymer networks via photopolymerization reactions of diacrylate liquid crystalline monomers with dithiols. Detailed analysis of model systems based on monoacrylate–dithiol reactions indicates that the polymer network architecture of LCEs prepared by this reaction contains extensive unreacted thiol content as dangling ends. Further, kinetic analysis indicates that polymerization in a liquid crystalline phase strongly hinders the mobility of reactive species during the formation of the LCE polymer network, which is evident in the substantial difference in viscosity between liquid crystalline monomers (0.0195 Pa s) and non-liquid crystalline monomers (0.0025 Pa s). In copolymerization with the diacrylate liquid crystal monomers, the dithiol comonomer significantly decreases the elastic modulus and Tg. The residual thiol in the LCE polymer network can be postfunctionalized with reactive additives.  aPublisher supplied data 3acopolymerization 3akinetics 3aliquid crystals 3amodulus of elasticity 3apolymers 3athiols 3aviscosity1 aFowler, Hayden E.1 aHerbert, Katie M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4640-42251 aSkillin, Nathaniel P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1424-90371 aBowman, Christopher N.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8458-77231 aWhite, Tim J.q(Timothy J.),1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8006-71730 tMacromolecules.g2021 Nov. 15, v. 54, no. 23 p.11074-11082dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23616x1520-58357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.macromol.1c019193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02858naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245008800169300001200257520154500269592002801814650000801842650001801850650001001868650001601878650001601894650001101910650001001921650003401931650001301965650001501978650003001993650002402023650001002047650001602057651000902073700005702082700003102139700002902170773013302199856008302332852000902415655001202424IND60727985320221119213838.0220306e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072798532DNAL7 a10.1007/s11250-021-02595-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlmasi, Mohammad10aGenome-wide association study for postweaning weight traits in Lori-Bakhtiari sheep  ap. 163.  aMarker-assisted selection is an effective method in novel animal breeding programs. This study was conducted to perform a genome-wide association study to detect candidate genes and quantitative trait loci associated with postweaning weight traits in meat-type sheep. Body weight records were collected during 29 years (1989 to 2017) in Lori-Bakhtiari sheep flock of the Shooli Breeding Station in Iran. A total of 132 animals were selected based on estimates of breeding values (EBVs) for body weight, using two-tailed and random selection strategies. Genomic DNA was extracted from whole blood samples. The samples were genotyped using Illumina OvineSNP50 BeadChip. De-regressed EBVs for postweaning body weight traits were used as pseudo-phenotypes in a genome-wide association study. One SNP on chromosome 10 (rs406324209) and two SNPs on chromosome 13 (rs401963094 and rs418761613) were significantly (Bonferroni-adjusted p-values < 0.05) associated with postweaning body weight traits. The significant variants accounted for 0.20% and 0.48% of the total genetic variances for 6- and 9-month body weights, respectively. Genomic heritabilities estimated for 6-, 9- and 12-month weights and postweaning weight gain were 0.28 ± 0.34, 0.35 ± 0.29, 0.37 ± 0.34, and 0.16 ± 0.33, respectively. Two significant SNPs were located within the ATP8A2 and PLXDC2 genes, on chromosomes 10 and 13, respectively. Based on the known gene ontologies, both ATP8A2 and PLXDC2 could be considered as candidate genes for postweaning body weight traits.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aanimal health 3ablood 3abody weight 3achromosomes 3aflocks 3agenes 3agenome-wide association study 3agenomics 3agenotyping 3amarker-assisted selection 3aquantitative traits 3asheep 3aweight gain 3aIran1 aZamani, Pouya1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1051-22591 aMirhoseini, Seyed Ziaeddin1 aMoradi, Mohammad Hossein0 tTropical animal health and production.g2021 Mar., v. 53, no. 1 p.163-163dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl706x0049-47477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11250-021-02595-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01486naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245006100167300001600228520052000244592002800764650001400792650001100806650001600817650002400833653000800857653000800865653000800873653002400881653002700905653002400932773009800956856008501054852000901139655001201148IND60609974820221122170529.0180824e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060997482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.econlet.2016.11.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTu, Yundong10aOn spurious regressions with partial unit root processes  ap. 142-145.  aThis paper considers spurious regressions with partial unit root and near partial unit root processes.

Mass spectrometric analyses of these lipids are complicated by the presence of isobaric molecular ions shared by these lipid classes and by relatively poor electrospray ionization, which is a consequence of an inherently weak dipole moment in these lipid classes. The current study demonstrates that lithiated adducts of CE and DAG molecular ions have enhanced ionization and lipid class-specific fragmentation in tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) scan modes, thereby allowing the implementation of strategies capable of lipid class-specific detection. Using neutral loss (NL) mode for the loss of cholestane from cholesterol esters (NL 368.5) and specific selected reaction monitoring for DAG molecular species, the response of specific molecular species to that of internal standards was determined. CE and DAG molecular species were quantified in human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAECs) incubated with both palmitic acid and oleic acid. Furthermore, NL 368.5 spectra revealed the oxidation of the aliphatic fatty acid residues of CE molecular species. Taken together, these studies demonstrate a new analytical approach to assessing CE and DAG molecular species that exploits the utility of lithiated adducts in conjunction with MS/MS approaches.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acholesteryl esters 3acoronary vessels 3adiacylglycerols 3aendothelial cells 3ahumans 3aionization 3aions 3amonitoring 3aoleic acid 3aoxidation 3apalmitic acid 3atandem mass spectrometry1 aAlbert, Carolyn J.1 aBarnaby, Omar S.1 aFord, David A.0 tAnalytical biochemistry.g2011 Oct. 15, v. 417, no. 2 p.202-210dElsevier Inc.x0003-26977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ab.2011.06.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02922naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245011400170300001400284520163300298592002801931650001501959650001901974650001901993650001502012650000902027650001902036650001402055650001802069651001102087653001902098653002302117653002202140653001902162653001902181653002402200700001802224700002302242700002002265773011002285856008402395852000902479655001202488IND60125811920221123030254.0150428e20150330xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012581192DNAL7 a10.1080/09064710.2014.9965882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMessing, Ingmar10aInfluence of higher rain intensities on phosphorus movements in the upper half meter of macroporous clay soil  ap. 93-99.  aIn climate change scenarios, the frequency of high-intensity rain events in Sweden is assumed to increase. In a plot experiment at Ultuna, Uppsala, the influence of rain intensities on phosphorus (P) transport in the uppermost 0.5 m of a clay soil was studied at 16 locations. A rain simulator, 0.5 × 0.5 m and mounted 1 m above the soil surface, was used to simulate 85–500 min rain sequences causing small (4–9 mm h ⁻¹) and large (22–28 mm h ⁻¹ and one extreme at 37 mm h ⁻¹) steady water fluxes (intensity) in the underlying soil profile. Water percolated to a zero-tension collector tray at 0.5 m depth where drain water and its sediment load was sampled at discrete time intervals. The total P (TP) mass flux ranged, at low intensity, between 12–92 μg m ⁻² min ⁻¹ (average 28.1 μg m ⁻² min ⁻¹) and, at high intensity, between 83–375 μg m ⁻² min ⁻¹ (average 168.5 μg m ⁻² min ⁻¹) and 648 μg m ⁻² min ⁻¹ at the extreme intensity. The soluble reactive (inorganic) P (SRP) mass flux ranged, at low intensity, between 1–65 μg m ⁻² min ⁻¹ (average 10.0 μg m ⁻² min ⁻¹) and, at high intensity, between 6–205 μg m ⁻² min ⁻¹ (average 47.9 μg m ⁻² min ⁻¹) and 495 μg m ⁻² min ⁻¹ at the extreme intensity. Thus, in the intensity range 4–28 mm h ⁻¹, TP and SRP increased, on average, by approximately 12% (μg m ⁻² min ⁻¹) per unit increase in intensity (mm h ⁻¹). The results of this study demonstrate increased sediment and P loss/mobility for clay soil under increased precipitation intensity predicted under climate change.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclay soils 3aclimate change 3adrainage water 3aphosphorus 3arain 3arain intensity 3asediments 3asoil profiles 3aSweden 0aclimate change 0ain-field lysimeter 0apreferential flow 0arain intensity 0arain simulator 0aphosphorus leaching1 aJoel, Abraham1 aWesström, Ingrid,1 aStrock, Jeffrey0 tActa agriculturæ Scandinavica.g2015 Mar. 30, v. 65, no. sup1 p.93-99dTaylor & Francisx1651-19137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09064710.2014.9965883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03450naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002000166245011900186300001800305520171900323592002802042650001102070650001502081650002102096650001302117650001402130650000902144650002602153650002002179650002702199650000902226650001802235650000902253650002602262650001402288650002302302650001502325650001502340650003102355650000902386650002202395650001302417650001802430650001602448650000902464653001902473653001902492653001102511653002002522700001602542700001902558700002102577700002002598773012802618856008102746852000902827655001202836IND60651483020221119201142.0190711e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065148302DNAL7 a279384612pmid7 a10.1017/S13689800160031892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatsuyama, Misa10aEffect of fortified milk on growth and nutritional status in young children: a systematic review and meta-analysis  ap. 1214-1225.  aAdequate nutrition is critical for optimal growth and development. However, young children may be at risk of nutrient deficiencies when transitioning to weaning foods for a variety of reasons. Supplementation with fortified milk may provide potentially lacking essential nutrients, but effects on growth and nutritional status are yet to be established. Five databases were searched for randomised controlled trials using fortified milk against control milk in young children. Outcomes were growth, body composition and/or biochemical markers. Pooled differences in means were calculated for continuous outcomes and odds ratios for binary outcomes. Randomised controlled trials set in any country. Otherwise healthy children aged 6–47 months. Fifteen articles met the eligibility criteria. Fortification varied from Fe, Zn, vitamins, essential fatty acids, to pre- and/or probiotics. Frequently reported outcomes were weight, height and Fe status. Studies varied in geographical location, sample size and duration. Fortified milk had minimal effects on weight gain (mean difference=0·17 kg; 95 % CI 0·02, 0·31 kg) compared with control milk. The risk of anaemia was reduced in fortified milk groups (OR=0·32; 95 % CI 0·15, 0·66) compared with control groups. There were no significant effects on height gain, changes in body composition or Hb concentration. Fortified milk is an effective source of complementary nutrition to supplement children in need when consumed in appropriate amounts in addition to a normal diet. Due to compositional differences, further research on fortified milk is warranted before making global recommendations on benefits for growth and nutritional outcomes in young children.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanemia 3abiomarkers 3abody composition 3achildren 3adatabases 3adiet 3aessential fatty acids 3afortified foods 3agrowth and development 3airon 3ameta-analysis 3amilk 3anutrient deficiencies 3anutrients 3anutritional status 3aodds ratio 3aprobiotics 3arandomized clinical trials 3arisk 3asystematic review 3avitamins 3aweaning foods 3aweight gain 3azinc 0aYoung children 0aFortified milk 0aGrowth 0aIron deficiency1 aHarb, Tracy1 aDavid, Michael1 aDavies, Peter SW1 aHill, Rebecca J0 tPublic health nutrition.g2017 May, v. 20, no. 7 p.1214-1225dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl56775x1475-27277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S13689800160031893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03364naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002300149245011700172300001400289520160200303592002801905650002001933650002301953650001901976650003001995650002202025650001102047650001302058650002302071650002102094650001902115650001402134650002502148650001202173650001302185650001602198650001902214650001102233650002002244650002102264650002502285650002002310650001802330650002502348653001902373653001302392653001202405653001902417653001902436653001702455700003102472700002602503700002702529773011302556856008402669852000902753655001202762IND60529744720221117191213.0190318e20160801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052974472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jplph.2016.05.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPiñero, María C.10aChanges in the salinity tolerance of sweet pepper plants as affected by nitrogen form and high CO2 concentration  ap. 18-27.  aThe assimilation and availability of nitrogen in its different forms can significantly affect the response of primary productivity under the current atmospheric alteration and soil degradation. An elevated CO2 concentration (e[CO2]) triggers changes in the efficiency and efficacy of photosynthetic processes, water use and product yield, the plant response to stress being altered with respect to ambient CO2 conditions (a[CO2]). Additionally, NH4+ has been related to improved plant responses to stress, considering both energy efficiency in N-assimilation and the overcoming of the inhibition of photorespiration at e[CO2]. Therefore, the aim of this work was to determine the response of sweet pepper plants (Capsicum annuum L.) receiving an additional supply of NH4+ (90/10 NO3−/NH4+) to salinity stress (60mM NaCl) under a[CO2] (400μmolmol−1) or e[CO2] (800μmolmol−1). Salt-stressed plants grown at e[CO2] showed DW accumulation similar to that of the non-stressed plants at a[CO2]. The supply of NH4+ reduced growth at e[CO2] when salinity was imposed. Moreover, NH4+ differentially affected the stomatal conductance and water use efficiency and the leaf Cl−, K+, and Na+ concentrations, but the extent of the effects was influenced by the [CO2]. An antioxidant-related response was prompted by salinity, the total phenolics and proline concentrations being reduced by NH4+ at e[CO2]. Our results show that the effect of NH4+ on plant salinity tolerance should be globally re-evaluated as e[CO2] can significantly alter the response, when compared with previous studies at a[CO2].  aPublisher supplied data 3aCapsicum annuum 3aammonium compounds 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon dioxide enrichment 3aenergy efficiency 3aleaves 3anitrogen 3aphenolic compounds 3aphotorespiration 3aplant response 3apotassium 3aprimary productivity 3aproline 3asalinity 3asalt stress 3asalt tolerance 3asodium 3asodium chloride 3asoil degradation 3astomatal conductance 3astress response 3asweet peppers 3awater use efficiency 0aClimate change 0aAmmonium 0aNitrate 0aCarbon dioxide 0aAbiotic stress 0aGas exchange1 aPérez-Jiménez, Margarita1 aLópez-Marín, Josefa1 adel Amor, Francisco M.0 tJournal of plant physiology.g2016 Aug. 01, v. 200 p.18-27dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl39020x0176-16177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jplph.2016.05.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02865naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245010800164300001400272500001900286520140400305592002801709650001601737650001601753650002501769650002001794650001701814650001201831650001701843650001901860650002201879650001301901650001101914650001401925650001701939650001401956650002101970653002501991653001802016653001802034653002302052700001602075700001302091700001202104700001402116773013702130856008302267852000902350655001202359IND60728900220221117160709.0210320e20210409xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072890022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2021.02.0552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTang, Wenyi10aFerrostatin-1 attenuates ferroptosis and protects the retina against light-induced retinal degeneration  ap. 27-34.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aDegenerative retinal diseases, including age-related macular degeneration, are serious diseases that may lead to irreversible retinal neuron damage and permanent vision impairment. There are currently no effective treatments for these diseases due to our incomplete understanding of the underlying pathological mechanisms. Ferroptosis, a newly identified iron-dependent mode of cell death, is implicated in various diseases. However, it is unknown whether ferroptosis is involved in light-induced retinal degeneration. In this study, we found that light exposure significantly reduced the viability of photoreceptor cells in vitro and induced pro-ferroptotic changes, including iron accumulation, mitochondrial shrinkage, glutathione depletion, increased malondialdehyde (MDA), and decreased protein expression of SLC7A11 and GPX4. The effects of light exposure on ferroptosis were attenuated by ferrostatin-1. Consistently, the results of in vivo studies demonstrated that ferrostatin-1 protected against light-induced ferroptosis. And it exerted therapeutic effects by inhibiting neuroinflammation and prevented the effects of light exposure on the structure and function of the retina. The findings reveal an important role of ferroptosis in the pathogenesis of light-induced retinal degeneration and suggest that ferroptosis may be a novel treatment target for preventing retinal degeneration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aferroptosis 3aglutathione 3amacular degeneration 3amalondialdehyde 3amitochondria 3aneurons 3apathogenesis 3aphotoreceptors 3aprotein synthesis 3aresearch 3aretina 3ashrinkage 3atherapeutics 3aviability 3avision disorders 0aRetinal degeneration 0aPhotoreceptor 0aFerrostatin-1 0aLipid peroxidation1 aGuo, Jingli1 aLiu, Wei1 aMa, Jun1 aXu, Gezhi0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2021 Apr. 09, v. 548 p.27-34dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2021.02.0553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02342naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245009000165300001400255520104700269592002801316650001501344650001601359650002601375650001901401650001801420650003201438650001101470650001501481650000901496650001501505650004401520650001601564653002601580653002501606653001001631653001801641700001801659700001801677700001301695773009301708856008601801852000901887655001201896IND60526125020221121090622.0190403e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052612502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.meatsci.2015.11.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Xiang10aMapping of TBARS distribution in frozen–thawed pork using NIR hyperspectral imaging  ap. 92-96.  aIn this study, NIR hyperspectral imaging technology was applied to determine the distribution of TBARS in frozen–thawed pork. A total of 240 fresh pork samples were assigned to 4 treatment groups (0, 1, 3, 5 frozen–thawed cycles). For each sample, a hyperspectral image (874–1734nm) was collected, followed by chemical TBARS analysis. Successive projection algorithm (SPA) was applied to choose effective wavelengths (EWs). The selected 13 EWs of the calibration set and relevant TBARS value were used as inputs of partial least squares regression (PLSR) model, yielding correlation coefficient of prediction of 0.81 and root mean square error of prediction of 0.33. The developed PLSR model were applied pixel-wise to produce chemical maps of TBARS for 24 selected samples in the prediction set. The results indicated that NIR hyperspectral imaging combined with image processing has the potential to visualize TBARS distribution in frozen–thawed pork. This technique could be useful in real-time quality monitoring in meat industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acorrelation 3ahyperspectral imagery 3aimage analysis 3aleast squares 3alivestock and meat industry 3amodels 3amonitoring 3apork 3aprediction 3athiobarbituric acid-reactive substances 3awavelengths 0aHyperspectral imaging 0aFrozen–thawed pork 0aTBARS 0aVisualization1 aSong, Xinglin1 aQiu, Zhengjun1 aHe, Yong0 tMeat science.g2016 Mar., v. 113 p.92-96dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8541x0309-17407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meatsci.2015.11.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03604naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100001800169245008400187300001800271520177500289592002802064650001302092650002602105650001302131650001302144650001802157650001902175650001902194650001602213650001302229650001702242650001802259650000902277650001602286650001202302650003102314650001102345650004802356650002402404650002902428650002002457650003102477650003902508650001702547650003402564650000902598650002502607650003802632650002502670650002202695700001602717700002002733700001802753773009102771856008402862990002302946852000902969655001202978IND60087431620221121045207.0141102e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008743162DNAL7 a232010192pmid7 a10.1016/j.actbio.2012.11.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Tse-Ying12aA novel ultrasound-triggered drug vehicle with multimodal imaging functionality  ap. 5453-5463.  aA novel remotely triggered drug vehicle having multimodal imaging functionality was developed. It exhibits magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, ultrasound (US) imaging, encapsulation of a hydrophobic agent and US-triggered release behavior. Lipophilic superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) nanoparticles were self-assembled with an amphiphilic chitosan derivative, carboxymethyl hexanoyl chitosan (CHC), to form superparamagnetic CHC/SPIO micelles and then loaded with camptothecin (a hydrophobic anticancer agent). The superparamagnetic micelles were then conjugated with albumin-based microbubbles (MBs) to form superparamagnetic micelle-decorated MBs (CHC/SPIO-decorated MBs). The albumin MBs and CHC/SPIO-decorated MBs both demonstrated in vitro concentration-dependent US imaging contrast. Interestingly, the in vitro US contrast was enhanced by decoration. In vivo US images showed that the B-mode contrast of the proposed vehicles could be clearly observed in the veins and arteries of Sprague–Dawley rats. Moreover, the proposed vehicle exhibited significant US-triggered release behavior under therapeutic US sonication at a frequency of 1MHz and power density of 2.4Wcm⁻² for 30min. However, similar behavior was not observed under diagnostic US bombardment at a frequency of 12MHz and mechanical index of 0.5. On the other hand, in vitro MR images of the CHC/SPIO-micelle-decorated MBs also revealed a significant concentration-dependent T₂ (spin–spin relaxation time) contrast due to their decoration with superparamagnetic micelles. Most importantly, the r₂ ∗-r₂ value of the CHC/SPIO-decorated MBs decreased after therapeutic US bombardment for 30min. This might be considered as an index to probe destruction of the drug-loaded CHC/SPIO micelles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalbumins 3aantineoplastic agents 3aarteries 3achitosan 3aencapsulation 3ahydrophobicity 3aimage analysis 3airon oxides 3amicelles 3amicrobubbles 3ananoparticles 3arats 3aultrasonics 2aAnimals 2aCamptothecinxpharmacology 2aCattle 2aChitosanxanalogs & derivativesxchemistry. 2aDextransxchemistry 2aDrug Carriersxchemistry 2aMagnetic Fields 2aMagnetic Resonance Imaging 2aMagnetite Nanoparticlesxchemistry 2aMicrobubbles 2aNanoparticlesxultrastructure 2aRats 2aRats, Sprague-Dawley 2aSerum Albumin, Bovinexmetabolism 2aUltrasonicsxmethods 2aX-Ray Diffraction1 aWu, Meng-Yu1 aLin, Meng-Hsuan1 aYang, Feng-Yi0 tActa biomaterialia.g2013 Mar., v. 9, no. 3 p.5453-5463dElsevier Ltdx1742-70617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actbio.2012.11.0233Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle04007naa a2200841 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100003200149245011300181300001400294520180600308592002802114650002102142650001802163650001802181650001502199650001602214650001002230650002202240650003102262650001002293650002002303650001402323650001602337650001102353650001502364650001602379650002602395650001702421650001302438650001802451650001702469650001302486650000902499650001002508650001402518650001202532650001402544650001802558650002002576650002902596650001502625653000802640653000802648653000702656653000902663653000802672653000702680653000802687653000602695653000802701653000802709653000902717653001802726653001102744653002902755653000902784653001802793700002202811700002002833700001702853700001802870700002102888700001802909700002002927773011302947856008403060852000903144655001203153IND60529744920221117191108.0190318e20160801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052974492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jplph.2016.06.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChandran, Anil Kumar Nalini10aGenome-wide transcriptome analysis of expression in rice seedling roots in response to supplemental nitrogen  ap. 62-75.  aNitrogen (N) is the most important macronutrient for plant growth and grain yields. For rice crops, nitrate and ammonium are the major N sources. To explore the genomic responses to ammonium supplements in rice roots, we used 17-day-old seedlings grown in the absence of external N that were then exposed to 0.5mM (NH4)2SO4 for 3h. Transcriptomic profiles were examined by microarray experiments. In all, 634 genes were up-regulated at least two-fold by the N-supplement when compared with expression in roots from untreated control plants. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis revealed that those upregulated genes are associated with 23 GO terms. Among them, metabolic processes for diverse amino acids (i.e., aspartate, threonine, tryptophan, glutamine, l-phenylalanine, and thiamin) as well as nitrogen compounds are highly over-represented, demonstrating that our selected genes are suitable for studying the N-response in roots. This enrichment analysis also indicated that nitrogen is closely linked to diverse transporter activities by primary metabolites, including proteins (amino acids), lipids, and carbohydrates, and is associated with carbohydrate catabolism and cell wall organization. Integration of results from omics analysis of metabolic pathways and transcriptome data using the MapMan tool suggested that the TCA cycle and pathway for mitochondrial electron transport are co-regulated when rice roots are exposed to ammonium. We also investigated the expression of N-responsive marker genes by performing a comparative analysis with root samples from plants grown under different NH4+ treatments. The diverse responses to such treatment provide useful insight into the global changes related to the shift from an N-deficiency to an enhanced N-supply in rice, a model crop plant.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium sulfate 3aaspartic acid 3acarbohydrates 3acell walls 3acrop models 3acrops 3aelectron transfer 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3agenetic markers 3aglutamine 3agrain yield 3alipids 3ametabolism 3ametabolites 3amicroarray technology 3amitochondria 3anitrogen 3aphenylalanine 3aplant growth 3aproteins 3arice 3aroots 3aseedlings 3athiamin 3athreonine 3atranscriptome 3atranscriptomics 3atricarboxylic acid cycle 3atryptophan 0aABA 0aABC 0aCK 0aDEGs 0aETH 0aGO 0aIAA 0aN 0aNUE 0aQTL 0aROAD 0aGene ontology 0aMapMan 0aNitrogen supplementation 0aRice 0aTranscriptome1 aPriatama, Ryza A.1 aKumar, Vikranth1 aXuan, Yuanhu1 aJe, Byoung Il1 aKim, Ch'ŏl-min,1 aJung, Ki-Hong1 aHan, Chang-deok0 tJournal of plant physiology.g2016 Aug. 01, v. 200 p.62-75dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl39020x0176-16177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jplph.2016.06.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04037naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002100166245008200187300001600269520202000285592002802305650002302333650001302356650002602369650001202395650002602407650001602433650001102449650002402460650002502484650001502509650001002524650001302534650001002547650001902557650001902576650001402595650001902609650001302628650002502641650001802666650001002684650001002694650001302704650007102717650007302788650003502861650006602896650002902962650001402991650001603005650002403021650002803045650001403073650003403087650002703121651001003148700001903158700002503177773009203202856004803294852000903342655001203351IND50059545220221121010314.0121102e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5005954522DNAL7 a226227652pmid7 a10.1007/s00248-012-0072-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBartrons, Mireia10aHigh Bacterial Diversity in Epilithic Biofilms of Oligotrophic Mountain Lakes  ap. 860-869.  aBenthic microbial biofilms attached to rocks (epilithic) are major sites of carbon cycling and can dominate ecosystem primary production in oligotrophic lakes. We studied the bacterial community composition of littoral epilithic biofilms in five connected oligotrophic high mountain lakes located at different altitudes by genetic fingerprinting and clone libraries of the 16S rRNA gene. Different intra-lake samples were analyzed, and consistent changes in community structure (chlorophyll a and organic matter contents, and bacterial community composition) were observed along the altitudinal gradient, particularly related with the location of the lake above or below the treeline. Epilithic biofilm genetic fingerprints were both more diverse among lakes than within lakes and significantly different between montane (below the tree line) and alpine lakes (above the tree line). The genetic richness in the epilithic biofilm was much higher than in the plankton of the same lacustrine area studied in previous works, with significantly idiosyncratic phylogenetic composition (specifically distinct from lake plankton or mountain soils). Data suggest the coexistence of aerobic, anaerobic, phototrophic, and chemotrophic microorganisms in the biofilm, Bacteroidetes and Cyanobacteria being the most important bacterial taxa, followed by Alpha-, Beta-, Gamma-, and Deltaproteobacteria, Chlorobi, Planctomycetes, and Verrucomicrobia. The degree of novelty was especially high for epilithic Bacteroidetes, and up to 50 % of the sequences formed monophyletic clusters distantly related to any previously reported sequence. More than 35 % of the total sequences matched at <95 % identity to any previously reported 16S rRNA gene, indicating that alpine epilithic biofilms are unexplored habitats that contain a substantial degree of novelty within a short geographical distance. Further research is needed to determine whether these communities are involved in more biogeochemical pathways than previously thought.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA fingerprinting 3aaltitude 3abacterial communities 3abiofilm 3abiogeochemical cycles 3achlorophyll 3aclones 3acommunity structure 3adelta-Proteobacteria 3aecosystems 3agenes 3ahabitats 3alakes 3amicroorganisms 3amountain soils 3amountains 3aorganic matter 3aplankton 3aprimary productivity 3aribosomal RNA 3arocks 3atrees 2aAltitude 2aBacteria, Aerobicxclassificationxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aBacteria, Anaerobicxclassificationxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aBiofilmsxgrowth & development 2aDNA, Bacterialxanalysisxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aDNA, Ribosomalxgenetics 2aEcosystem 2aGenes, rRNA 2aLakesxmicrobiology 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhylogeny 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 16Sxgenetics 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 0aSpain1 aCatalan, Jordi1 aCasamayor, Emilio O.0 tMicrobial ecology.g2012 Nov., v. 64, no. 4 p.860-869dSpringer-Verlagx0095-36287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00248-012-0072-4  aDNAL 7aarticle01968naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245008300175300001400258520098700272592002801259650001501287650000801302650001301310650001201323650001101335650001301346650002101359650001401380700003501394700002301429773008501452856008401537852000901621655001201630IND60590433120221119201733.0180313e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059043312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2015.12.0912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTravlou, Nikolina A.10aSensing of NH3 on heterogeneous nanoporous carbons in the presence of humidity  ap. 64-73.  aThe influence of humidity on the NH3 detection capability of S- and N-containing nanoporous carbons was examined for the first time. To investigate the role of water on the electrical performance of the sensors, the sensing tests were carried out using a flow of NH3 diluted in moist air. The same tests were also carried out by performing a 2 h prehumidification prior to the exposure of the carbons to the moist gas stream. Compared to dry conditions, the presence of water in the air stream led to an enhanced response of the sensor. On the other hand, upon the prehumidification the adsorbent's surface an opposite outcome was recorded. Based on the electrical behavior of the carbons and their extensive surface characterization, a complex sensing mechanism is proposed. This mechanism includes specific interactions of NH3 and H2O molecules with surface functionalities, such as hydrogen bonding, proton transport through ionic conductivity, and electron–hole conductivity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aair 3aair flow 3aammonia 3acarbon 3ahumidity 3ahydrogen bonding 3ananopores1 aRodríguez-Castellón, Enrique1 aBandosz, Teresa J.0 tCarbon.g2016 Apr., v. 100 p.64-73dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2015.12.0913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01224naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245010100153300002000254520026900274592002800543650001300571650002300584650001300607650002300620650001200643650001200655700001800667700001800685773012400703856007400827852000900901655001200910IND60666870820221122170941.0190919e20141022xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066687082DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra09431j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Bo10aCopper-catalyzed enantioselective propargylic substitution of propargylic acetates with enamines  ap. 53216-53219.  aWith the use of chiral tridentate P,N,N ligand, copper-catalyzed enantioselective propargylic substitution of propargylic acetates with enamines has been achieved, giving the corresponding propargylic ketones in high yields and with excellent enantioselectivities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetates 3acatalytic activity 3aenamines 3aenantioselectivity 3aketones 3aligands1 aLiu, Chunxiao1 aGuo, Hongchao0 tRSC advances.g2014 Oct. 22, v. 4, no. 95 p.53216-53219dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ra09431j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03332naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245011200164300001500276520163300291592002801924650001301952650003301965650002301998650000902021650001002030650001202040650003102052650001002083650001102093650001502104650001202119650001402131650001502145650001502160650001502175650002902190650002602219650001102245653004502256653001002301653002502311653003002336653001702366700001402383700002202397700001802419700001802437700001502455700001402470700002202484700001702506700001902523773009802542856008102640852000902721655001202730IND60699802720221120172531.0210311e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069980272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cj.2020.05.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Jingxin10aIdentification of two glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase genes in maize leaf phosphorus remobilization  ap. 95-108.  aPhosphate deficiency is one of the leading causes of crop productivity loss. Phospholipid degradation liberates phosphate to cope with phosphate deficiency. Glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterases (GPX-PDEs) hydrolyse the intermediate products of phospholipid catabolism glycerophosphodiesters into glycerol-3-phosphate, a precursor of phosphate. However, the function of GPX-PDEs in phosphate remobilization in maize remains unclear. In the present study, we characterized two phosphate deficiency-inducible GPX-PDE genes, ZmGPX-PDE1 and ZmGPX-PDE5, in maize leaves. ZmGPX-PDE1 and ZmGPX-PDE5 were transcriptionally regulated by ZmPHR1, a well-described phosphate starvation-responsive transcription factor of the MYB family. Complementation of the yeast GPX-PDE mutant gde1∆ indicated that ZmGPX-PDE1 and ZmGPX-PDE5 functioned as GPX-PDEs, suggesting their roles in phosphate recycling from glycerophosphodiesters. In vitro enzyme assays showed that ZmGPX-PDE1 and ZmGPX-PDE5 catalysed glycerophosphodiester degradation with different substrate preferences for glycerophosphoinositol and glycerophosphocholine, respectively. ZmGPX-PDE1 was upregulated during leaf senescence, and more remarkably, loss of ZmGPX-PDE1 in maize compromised the remobilization of phosphorus from senescing leaves to young leaves, resulting in a stay-green phenotype under phosphate starvation. These results suggest that ZmGPX-PDE1 catalyses the degradation of glycerophosphodiesters in maize, promoting phosphate recycling from senescing leaves to new leaves. This mechanism is crucial for improving phosphorus utilization efficiency in crops.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZea mays 3aalpha-glycerophosphoric acid 3acatalytic activity 3acorn 3acrops 3aenzymes 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3aleaves 3ametabolism 3amutants 3aphenotype 3aphosphates 3aphosphorus 3astarvation 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 3ayeasts 0aGlycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterases 0aMaize 0aPhosphate deficiency 0aPhosphorus remobilization 0aPhospholipid1 aGuangpan,1 aNikiforov, Alexiy1 aKing, William1 aHong, Wanting1 aLi, Weiwei1 aHan, Yang1 aPatton-Vogt, Jana1 aShen, Jianbo1 aCheng, Lingyun0 tcrop journal.g2021 Feb., v. 9, no. 1 p.95-108dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23202x2214-51417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cj.2020.05.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03405naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005600153245014600209300001600355520190600371592002802277650001402305650001102319650002502330650003502355650002202390650001602412650002002428650001802448650001602466650001602482651001002498653003302508653003302541653002802574653002202602653002302624653000802647700002802655700002702683700002102710773011902731856008802850852000902938655001202947IND60606638620221120130522.0220124e20160201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060663862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2015.11.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlcaraz, Mar1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4964-180810aAdvection and dispersion heat transport mechanisms in the quantification of shallow geothermal resources and associated environmental impacts  ap. 536-546.  aBorehole Heat Exchangers (BHEs) are increasingly being used to exploit shallow geothermal energy. This paper presents a new methodology to provide a response to the need for a regional quantification of the geothermal potential that can be extracted by BHEs and the associated environmental impacts. A set of analytical solutions facilitates accurate calculation of the heat exchange of BHEs with the ground and its environmental impacts. For the first time, advection and dispersion heat transport mechanisms and the temporal evolution from the start of operation of the BHE are taken into account in the regional estimation of shallow geothermal resources.This methodology is integrated in a GIS environment, which facilitates the management of input and output data at a regional scale. An example of the methodology's application is presented for Barcelona, in Spain. As a result of the application, it is possible to show the strengths and improvements of this methodology in the development of potential maps of low temperature geothermal energy as well as maps of environmental impacts. The minimum and maximum energy potential values for the study site are 50 and 1800W/m² for a drilled depth of 100m, proportionally to Darcy velocity. Regarding to thermal impacts, the higher the groundwater velocity and the energy potential, the higher the size of the thermal plume after 6months of exploitation, whose length ranges from 10 to 27m long. A sensitivity analysis was carried out in the calculation of heat exchange rate and its impacts for different scenarios and for a wide range of Darcy velocities. The results of this analysis lead to the conclusion that the consideration of dispersion effects and temporal evolution of the exploitation prevent significant differences up to a factor 2.5 in the heat exchange rate accuracy and up to several orders of magnitude in the impacts generated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadvection 3aenergy 3aenvironmental impact 3ageographic information systems 3ageothermal energy 3agroundwater 3aheat exchangers 3aheat transfer 3amethodology 3atemperature 3aSpain 0aShallow geothermal potential 0aEnvironmental thermal impact 0aBorehole heat exchanger 0aThermal advection 0aThermal dispersion 0aGIS1 aGarcía Gil, Alejandro,1 aVázquez-Suñé, Enric1 aVelasco, Violeta0 tScience of the total environment.g2016 Feb. 01, v. 543 p.536-546dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2015.11.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02196naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245011300167300001800280520122000298592002801518650001101546650001701557650001201574650001901586650001901605651001801624700002001642700002201662773010801684856008101792852000901873655001201882IND60520931920221120023941.0160526e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052093192DNAL7 a10.1007/s00382-015-2781-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuiskamp, W.

We find that changes in the biological pump are mainly driven by changes in ocean residence times while changes in export production are negligible. Changes in the biological and physical pumps are always of opposite sign; with the physical pump being dominant for southward shifts and the biological pump being dominant for northward shifts. Furthermore, changes in the Pacific Ocean carbon budget dictate the overall changes in global marine and atmospheric carbon. Overall, atmospheric [Formula: see text] increases (and [Formula: see text] decreases) for northward shifts or a strengthening in wind forcing. The opposite is true for a southward shift or a weakening in wind forcing. Combining forcings (shift and intensity change) results in a combination of their impacts with the direction of the shift being the first order forcing. The terrestrial carbon reservoir absorbs (releases) 50–70 % of the net oceanic carbon loss (increase), counterbalancing the effect on atmospheric [Formula: see text].  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acarbon cycle 3aclimate 3aclimate models 3awind direction 3aPacific Ocean1 aMeissner, K.

The objective of this study was to determine the molecular prevalence of 5 different genera of vector borne pathogens (Anaplasma, Babesia, Bartonella, Ehrlichia, and Hemotropic Mycoplasma spp.) using blood collected from 28 live-trapped arctic foxes from the region of Karrak Lake, Nunavut, Canada. Bartonella henselae (n = 3), Mycoplasma haemocanis (n = 1), Ehrlichia canis (n = 1), and an Anaplasma sp. (n = 1) DNA were PCR amplified and subsequently identified by sequencing. This study provides preliminary evidence that vector borne pathogens, not typically associated with the arctic ecosystem, exist at low levels in this arctic fox population, and that vector exposure, pathogen transmission dynamics, and changes in the geographic distribution of pathogens over time should be investigated in future studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnaplasma 3aBabesia 3aBartonella henselae 3aDNA 3aEhrlichia canis 3aMycoplasma haemocanis 3aVulpes lagopus 3abiodiversity 3ablood 3aecosystems 3ageographical distribution 3alakes 3apathogens 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aNunavut 0aFoxes 0aCanada 0aVector-borne 0aBartonella 0aMycoplasma 0aEhrlichia 0aZoonosis1 aElmore, Stacey A.1 aJenkins, Emily J.1 aAlisauskas, Ray T.1 aWalsh, Mary1 aBreitschwerdt, Edward B.1 aMaggi, Ricardo G.0 tResearch in veterinary science.g2015 Apr., v. 99 p.58-59dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45491x0034-52887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rvsc.2014.12.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02338naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245009000170300001600260500001500276520113600291592002801427650002201455650001901477650001001496650001101506650001901517650001501536650001501551650002601566651001001592653001001602700001501612700001701627700001401644700001601658700002401674773010301698856008301801990002301884852000901907655001201916IND60098181120221118014118.0141104e20130115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009818112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.yexcr.2012.09.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Huang-Tian10aCardiomyocytes derived from pluripotent stem cells: Progress and prospects from China  ap. 120-125.  a2019-12-06  aTransplantation of embryonic stem cell- or induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (CMs) represents one promising approach for the treatment of myocardial infarction and failing hearts. Cardiac differentiation systems from these pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) can also be employed to better understand early developmental biology, drug discovery, toxicology testing, and disease modeling. A prerequisite to attain these goals is the ability to generate functional CMs in an efficient and reliable way. The lack of CM maturation must also be overcome, and appropriate methods for introducing PSC-CMs into heart while maintaining cell viability must be optimized. The past few years have seen major advances both in the differentiation, characterization and application of these cells to biological systems. Here we review recent progress, especially those performed in China, in basic stem cell biology involving studies of cardiogenesis and CMs through PSC differentiation, approaches for chamber-specific CM differentiation, maturation processes involving regulation of intracellular Ca²⁺ signals, and applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcium signaling 3acell viability 3adrugs 3amodels 3acardiomyocytes 3astem cells 3atoxicology 3amyocardial infarction 3aChina 0aheart1 aZhang, Min1 aHuang, Jijun1 aLiang, He1 aZhang, Peng1 aBoheler, Kenneth R.0 tExperimental cell research.g2013 Jan. 15, v. 319, no. 2 p.120-125dElsevier Inc.x0014-48277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.yexcr.2012.09.0113Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03569naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024002200117024001900139040001800158100002100176245015400197300001500351520201800366592002802384650002802412650002302440650001202463650002102475650001502496650001702511650002102528650001602549650001802565650001102583650001502594650000702609650002102616650001202637650002802649650001702677650001602694700002302710773015202733856007002885856010002955990002303055852000903078655001203087IND60608549420221119100704.0190510e20170811xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060854942DNAL7 a10.3791/556982doi7 aPMC56142432pmcid7 a288294302pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRossano, Adam J.10aOptical quantification of intracellular ph in Drosophila melanogaster malpighian tubule epithelia with a fluorescent genetically-encoded ph indicator  ap. e55698.  aEpithelial ion transport is vital to systemic ion homeostasis as well as maintenance of essential cellular electrochemical gradients. Intracellular pH (pHi) is influenced by many ion transporters and thus monitoring pHi is a useful tool for assessing transporter activity. Modern Genetically Encoded pH-Indicators (GEpHIs) provide optical quantification of pHi in intact cells on a cellular and subcellular scale. This protocol describes real-time quantification of cellular pHi regulation in Malpighian Tubules (MTs) of Drosophila melanogaster through ex vivo live-imaging of pHerry, a pseudo-ratiometric GEpHI with a pKa well-suited to track pH changes in the cytosol. Extracted adult fly MTs are composed of morphologically and functionally distinct sections of single-cell layer epithelia, and can serve as an accessible and genetically tractable model for investigation of epithelial transport. GEpHIs offer several advantages over conventional pH-sensitive fluorescent dyes and ion-selective electrodes. GEpHIs can label distinct cell populations provided appropriate promoter elements are available. This labeling is particularly useful in ex vivo, in vivo, and in situ preparations, which are inherently heterogeneous. GEpHIs also permit quantification of pHi in intact tissues over time without need for repeated dye treatment or tissue externalization. The primary drawback of current GEpHIs is the tendency to aggregate in cytosolic inclusions in response to tissue damage and construct over-expression. These shortcomings, their solutions, and the inherent advantages of GEpHIs are demonstrated in this protocol through assessment of basolateral proton (H+) transport in functionally distinct principal and stellate cells of extracted fly MTs. The techniques and analysis described are readily adaptable to a wide variety of vertebrate and invertebrate preparations, and the sophistication of the assay can be scaled from teaching labs to intricate determination of ion flux via specific transporters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3aMalpighian tubules 3acytosol 3aelectrochemistry 3aepithelium 3afluorescence 3afluorescent dyes 3ahomeostasis 3ainvertebrates 3amodels 3amonitoring 3apH 3apromoter regions 3aprotons 3aspecific ion electrodes 3atransporters 3avertebrates1 aRomero, Michael F.0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2017 Aug. 11, , no. 126 p.e55698-e55698dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3791/556983Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/55698/optical-quantification-intracellular-ph-drosophila-melanogaster  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02398naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005400150245008200204300001600286520128900302592002801591650003701619650001101656650001301667650001301680700001801693700002101711700002601732700001801758700002001776700001801796700001901814700002301833773008701856856008401943852000902027655001202036IND60590433320221119201605.0180313e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059043332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2015.12.0942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Yu-Pu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6092-717X10aEfficient and low-damage nitrogen doping of graphene via plasma-based methods  ap. 337-344.  aWe investigate the nitrogen doping of mono- and bi-layer graphene on 6H–SiC(0001) using two plasma-based methods: a lab-scale microwave plasma gun and an industrial-scale plasma-based implanter. As revealed by X-ray photoemission spectroscopy, the thickness of the pristine graphene significantly influences the bonding configuration of the incorporated nitrogen atoms. Using the plasma gun, a high concentration of graphitic-nitrogen (3 at%) is obtained in N-doped bilayer graphene, while only 0.2 at% of pyridinic-nitrogen is incorporated. By contrast, a comparable amount of each nitrogen doping configuration is found with monolayer graphene. The integrity of the bilayer graphene is also better preserved than its monolayer counterpart after nitrogen plasma exposure, as evidenced by their inverse photoemission spectra. It is attributed to a better stability and a lower vacancy creation rate in bilayer graphene during plasma exposure. In addition, the N-doped bilayer graphene shows an efficient n-type doping, with a Dirac point brought 0.45 ± 0.1 eV away from the Fermi energy. In brief, this study reports an efficient method for tailoring the electronic properties of graphene using industry-suited techniques, thereby promoting future graphene-based applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aenergy 3agraphene 3anitrogen1 aKsari, Younal1 aAubel, Dominique1 aHajjar-Garreau, Samar1 aBorvon, Gaël1 aSpiegel, Yohann1 aRoux, Laurent1 aSimon, Laurent1 aThemlin, Jean-Marc0 tCarbon.g2016 Apr., v. 100 p.337-344dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2015.12.0943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03105naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001700144245013600161300002000297520162000317592002801937650003701965650001502002650001502017650001202032650001102044650002102055650001502076650001102091650001302102650001102115650001402126650001402140650000702154650002402161650002302185653001302208653002102221653002002242653001202262653001202274653001402286700001602300700001702316700002402333700001502357773012602372856008002498852000902578655001202587IND60532188220221118025159.0160728e20160727xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053218822DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.6b060462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuo, Jinming10aZirconia (ZrO2) Embedded in Carbon Nanowires via Electrospinning for Efficient Arsenic Removal from Water Combined with DFT Studies  ap. 18912-18921.  aTo use zirconia (ZrO₂) as an efficient environmental adsorbent, it can be impregnated on a support to improve its physical properties and lower the overall cost. In this study, ZrO₂ embedded in carbon nanowires (ZCNs) is fabricated via an electrospinning method to remove arsenic (As) from water. The maximum adsorption capacity values of As(III) and As(V) on the ZCNs are 28.61 and 106.57 mg/g, respectively, at 40 °C. These capacities are considerably higher than those of pure ZrO₂ (2.56 and 3.65 mg/g for As(III) and As(V), respectively) created using the same procedure as for the ZCNs. Meanwhile, the adsorption behaviors of As(III) and As(V) on the ZCNs are endothermic and pH dependent and follow the Freundlich isotherm model and pseudo-first-order kinetic model. Both As(III) and As(V) are chemisorbed onto the ZCNs, which is confirmed by a partial density of state (PDOS) analysis and Dubinin–Radushkevich (D-R) model calculations. Furthermore, the ZCNs also possess the capability to enhance or catalyze the oxidation process of As(III) to As(V) using dissolved oxygen. This result is confirmed by a batch experiment, XPS analysis and Mulliken net charge analysis. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate the different configurations of As(III) and As(V) complexes on the tetragonal ZrO₂ (t-ZrO₂)(111) and monoclinic ZrO₂ (m-ZrO₂)(111) planes, respectively. The adsorption energy (Eₐd) of As(V) is higher than that of As(III) on both the t-ZrO₂(111) and m-ZrO₂ (111) planes (3.38 and 1.90 eV, respectively, for As(V) and 0.37 and 0.12 eV, respectively, for As(III)).  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aarsenic 3acarbon 3adissolved oxygen 3aendothermy 3aenergy 3akinetics 3amodels 3ananowires 3aoxidation 3apH 3aphysical properties 3asorption isotherms 0azirconia 0acarbon nanowires 0aelectrospinning 0aarsenic 0aremoval 0aDFT study1 aLuo, Xubiao1 aHu, Chengzhi1 aCrittenden, John C.1 aQu, Jiuhui0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2016 July 27, v. 8, no. 29 p.18912-18921dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.6b060463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03980naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024003500132040001800167100001800185245013500203500001900338506007600357506003100433520208800464592002802552596008302580596004402663506003702707650001302744650001602757650001602773650001902789650001902808650001502827650001602842650001802858650002302876650001802899650001302917651001502930653001902945653001002964653001902974653002402993653001903017653001203036653002103048653001603069653001403085653001003099653002903109700002803138700001803166773011503184856008203299852000903381655001203390IND60696886320221207063053.0210401e20200915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069688632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rse.2020.1118072chorus7 a10.1016/j.rse.2020.1118072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlonso, Alice10aCoupling high-resolution field monitoring and MODIS for reconstructing wetland historical hydroperiod at a high temporal frequency  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aHistorical wetland hydrology data are instrumental to support the design of wetland management and restoration strategies but are rarely available. In this study, we tested the capabilities and limitations of a simple methodological framework based on publicly available MODIS Land Reflectance Products to estimate wetland soil surface saturation and inundation spatiotemporal dynamics. Using supervised learning and high-resolution groundwater and surface water elevation data, the framework searches for spectral algorithms, referred to as the wet/dry wetland status classifier (WSC) and the continuous wetland dynamics identifier (WDI), that best predict upper soil layer wetness status in the study wetland. We used Google Earth Engine (GEE) for fast access and processing of the full range of MODIS data. The capabilities of GEE also enabled us to readily conduct a comparative assessment of the MODIS 8-day composite and daily collections and test various pixel-level quality filters to select reliable data at the highest possible temporal resolution. We tested the framework on the internationally-recognized Ramsar site Palo Verde National Park wetland in Costa Rica, and we obtained good results (overall prediction accuracy of 86.6% and kappa coefficient of 0.7 for the WSC; r² of 0.71 for the WDI). High-resolution water level data allowed us to assess the challenges, promises and limitations of using MODIS products for wetland hydrology applications. We then applied the WSC and WDI to map the 2000-2016 sub-weekly wetland hydroperiod at 500m resolution, achieving a temporal resolution rarely matched in remote sensing for wetland studies. The analysis of the end-products, combined with the field water elevation data, provided new insights into the drivers controlling the spatiotemporal dynamics of hydroperiod within the Palo Verde wetland and did not reveal any significant temporal trends. The WSC and WDI framework developed here can be useful for reconstructing long-term hydroperiod variability and uncovering its drivers for other wetland systems globally.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100005825  cNSFdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000000010 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aInternet 3aenvironment 3agroundwater 3aimage analysis 3anational parks 3aprediction 3areflectance 3asurface water 3awetland management 3awetland soils 3awetlands 3aCosta Rica 0aRemote sensing 0aMODIS 0aSpectral index 0aGoogle Earth Engine 0aGroundtruthing 0aWetland 0aTropical wetland 0aHydroperiod 0aHydrology 0aFlood 0aPalo Verde National Park1 aMuñoz Carpena, Rafael,1 aKaplan, David0 tRemote sensing of environment.g2020 Sept. 15, v. 247 p.111807-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11735x0034-42577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2020.1118073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03824naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100003000188245018300218300001600401506007600417520180300493592002802296506003702324650002302361650002502384650000802409650002802417650001702445650001702462650001902479650001602498650000902514650001302523650001802536650001002554650002502564650002202589650001302611650001502624650001102639650002002650650001402670650002702684650002202711650002302733650000902756650002102765650001002786650000902796700002802805700002602833700003302859700003402892700004102926700002602967773009102993856008103084852000903165655001203174IND60585576420221207114528.0171110e201111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058557642DNAL7 a10.1007/s12263-011-0217-y2doi7 aPMC31978442pmcid7 a214841582pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiranda-Vilela, Ana Luisa10aGenetic polymorphisms influence runners’ responses to the dietary ingestion of antioxidant supplementation based on pequi oil (Caryocar brasiliense Camb.): a before-after study  ap. 369-395.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aGenes have been implicated in the levels of oxidative stress, lipids, CVD risk, immune reactivity, and performance. Pequi oil (Caryocar brasiliense) has shown anti-inflammatory and hypotensive effects, besides reducing exercise-induced DNA, tissue damages, and anisocytosis. Given that diet can interact with the human genome to influence health and disease, and because genetic variability can influence response to diet, we aim to investigate the influence of 12 gene polymorphisms on inflammatory markers, postprandial lipids, arterial pressure, and plasma lipid peroxidation of runners (N = 125), before and after 14 days of 400 mg pequi-oil supplementation, after races under closely comparable conditions. Arterial pressure was checked before races; blood samples were taken immediately after racing to perform leukogram and plateletgram, Tbars assay, lipid, and CRP dosages and genotyping. CAT, GST-M1/T1, CRP-G1059C, and MTHFR-C677T polymorphisms influenced post-pequi-oil responses in leukogram; Hp and MTHFR-C677T, in plateletgram; Hp, ACE, GSTT1, and MTHFR-A1298C, in lipid profile; MTHFR-A1298C, in C-reactive protein (CRP) levels; and Hp and MnSOD, in Tbars assay. Differences between ACE genotypes in leukogram and total cholesterol disappeared after pequi, and the same occurred for Hp and MnSOD in Tbars assay and for MTHFR-A1298C with CRP levels. Because genetic inheritance is one of the factors that drive atherosclerosis-related lipid abnormalities, results can contribute to a greater understanding of the influence of genetic polymorphisms in situations that push up free radicals. Knowledge is also expanded on how antioxidant supplementation affects an individual’s genes and how athletic genetic makeup can affect the way a person responds to antioxidant supplements.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aC-reactive protein 3aCaryocar brasiliense 3aDNA 3aantihypertensive effect 3aantioxidants 3ablood lipids 3ablood sampling 3acholesterol 3adiet 3aexercise 3afree radicals 3agenes 3agenetic polymorphism 3agenetic variation 3agenotype 3agenotyping 3ahumans 3aimmune response 3aingestion 3ainheritance (genetics) 3alipid composition 3alipid peroxidation 3aoils 3aoxidative stress 3araces 3arisk1 aLordelo, Graciana Souza1 aAkimoto, Arthur Kenji1 aAlves, Penha Cristina Zaidan1 aPereira, Luiz Carlos da Silva1 aKlautau-Guimarães, Maria de Nazaré1 aGrisolia, Cesar Koppe0 tGenes & nutrition.g2011 Nov., v. 6, no. 4 p.369-395dSpringer-Verlagx1555-89327nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12263-011-0217-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02221naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245015500159300001800314520096300332592002801295650001301323650001401336650001101350650001401361650002301375650001101398650001101409650000901420650001201429650001401441650002401455650000901479700002101488700001601509700001601525700002101541700002101562773013201583856007501715852000901790655001201799IND60538820320221121085558.0160815e20130424xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053882032DNAL7 a10.1021/ja400367h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHayashi, Yukiko10aEnzyme-Like Catalysis via Ternary Complex Mechanism: Alkoxy-Bridged Dinuclear Cobalt Complex Mediates Chemoselective O-Esterification over N-Amidation  ap. 6192-6199.  aHydroxy group-selective acylation in the presence of more nucleophilic amines was achieved using acetates of first-row late transition metals, such as Mn, Fe, Co, Cu, and Zn.

The function of two differentially ubiquitinated proteins for fiber growth was demonstrated. Ubiquitination is one of the most common post-translational modifications of proteins, and it plays essential roles in plant growth and development. However, the involvement of ubiquitination in the growth of plant fibers remains largely unknown. We compared the ubiquitylome of the top and middle stems of ramie bark, with different fiber growth stages. We identified 249 differentially ubiquitinated sites in 197 proteins in fiber-developing barks in the stems and found that seven were homologs of Arabidopsis proteins associated with fiber growth. Overexpression of the differentially ubiquitinated proteins, RWA3 homolog whole_GLEAN_10024150 and MYB protein whole_GLEAN_10015497, significantly promoted fiber growth in transgenic Arabidopsis, indicating their involvement in this process. We also found that the abundance of these proteins decreased when their ubiquitination levels increased and vice versa in the fiber-developing bark. These results indicated that the abundance of these two proteins was adjusted through ubiquitin-dependent degradation. Collectively, our findings provide important insights into the involvement of ubiquitination in the growth of ramie fibers.  aPublisher supplied data  a31871678, 32001512cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aCAAS-ASTIP-IBFCcthe Agricultural Science and Technology Innovation Program of China  anycytx-19-E16cthe National Modern Agroindustry Technology Research System of China 3aArabidopsis 3abark 3aplant growth 3aramie 3aubiquitination1 aZeng, Zheng1 aLi, Fu1 aHuang, Renyan1 aWang, Yanzhou1 aLiu, Touming1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0599-75270 tPlanta.g2021 July, v. 254, no. 1 p.1-1dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl46291x0032-09357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00425-021-03652-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02640naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001900144245011100163300002000274520099300294592002801287650002101315650004401336650002301380650002201403650003701425650002901462650001301491650001701504650001301521650001901534650001901553650001801572650001101590650003701601653001301638653001101651653001801662653001801680653001501698653001701713700001601730700001701746700002301763700003101786700001701817700002401834700002501858773012601883856008002009852000902089655001202098IND60532188420170718000000.0160728e20160727xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053218842DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.6b060522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKellici, Suela10aCalixarene Assisted Rapid Synthesis of Silver-Graphene Nanocomposites with Enhanced Antibacterial Activity  ap. 19038-19046.  aDemonstrated herein is a single rapid approach employed for synthesis of Ag–graphene nanocomposites, with excellent antibacterial properties and low cytotoxicity, by utilizing a continuous hydrothermal flow synthesis (CHFS) process in combination with p-hexasulfonic acid calix[6]arene (SCX6) as an effective particle stabilizer. The nanocomposites showed high activity against E. coli (Gram-negative) and S. aureus (Gram-positive) bacteria. The materials were characterized using a range of techniques including transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Raman spectroscopy, UV–vis spectrophotometry, FT-IR, and X-ray powder diffraction (XRD).

The PPF copolymer was synthesised by two steps using DCC/NHS chemistry and characterized by FT-IR and ¹H-NMR techniques. The curcumin was encapsulated in PPF by single emulsion-solvent evaporation method. The nanoparticles were characterised by TEM and DLS for their size and morphology. The thermal properties were assessed by DSC data. In vitro release kinetics measurements of the drug from the nanoparticles showed a controlled release pattern over a period of time. The MTT assay depicted a high amount of cytotoxicity of PPF nanocurcumin in HeLa cells. Cellular uptake studies demonstrated the efficacy of surface engineering with folate over free nanoparticles. Furthermore, the biological evaluations, for example AO/EB staining, DAPI staining, and clonogenic assay of the nanoparticles confirm the efficacy and mechanism by which the cytotoxicity was induced.  aPublisher supplied data 3a4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aantineoplastic activity 3abiological assessment 3acomposite polymers 3acurcumin 3acytotoxicity 3adrugs 3aencapsulation 3aengineering 3aevaporation 3afolic acid 3ananoparticles 3aneoplasm cells 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3areceptors 3astaining 3athermal properties1 aThulasidasan, Arun Kumar T.1 aAnto, Ruby John1 aDevika, Nandan C.1 aAshwanikumar, N.1 aKumar, G.

In the presence of transition metals (iron and copper), the antiscorbutic factor shifts from an antioxidant to a pro-oxidant function. Haptoglobin (Hp) is a plasma α-2 glycoprotein characterized by 3 common phenotypes (Hp 1–1, Hp 2–1 and Hp 2–2). Its free hemoglobin (Hb)-binding capacity prevents Hb-driven oxidative damage. When the antioxidant capacity of Hp is insufficient, its role is taken over by hemopexin (heme-binding protein) and by vitamin C (free radical scavenger). The Hp 2–2 phenotype has a lower capacity to inhibit oxidation and vitamin C depletion. In this article, two consequences of this major finding are tackled. The Hp polymorphism is an important non-nutritional modifying factor in the pathogenesis of vitamin C deficiency and scurvy, which may explain the success of long-range human migration by the natural selection of some populations characterized by high Hp 1 allele frequencies. Moreover, we propose tailoring the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) values of vitamin C, taking into consideration the Hp phenotype dependency.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aantioxidant activity 3aascorbic acid 3aascorbic acid deficiency 3acopper 3afood intake 3afree radical scavengers 3agene frequency 3ahaptoglobins 3ahemoglobin 3aimmigration 3airon 3anatural selection 3aoxidation 3apathogenesis 3aphenotype 3ascurvy1 aLanglois, Michel R.1 aDe Buyzere, Marc L.1 aNa, Na1 aOuyang, Jin1 aSpeeckaert, Marijn M.1 aTorck, Mathieu A.0 tGenes & nutrition.g2011 Nov., v. 6, no. 4 p.341-346dSpringer-Verlagx1555-89327nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12263-011-0237-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01832naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001700142245011300159300001800272520078800290592002801078650001101106650003101117650002101148650001201169700002101181700002101202700002401223700001501247700002601262773013101288856007801419852000901497655001201506IND60568797420170628000000.0170517e20170517xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056879742DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.7b029502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Dawei10aAnion Binding in Water Drives Structural Adaptation in an Azaphosphatrane-Functionalized FeII4L4 Tetrahedron  ap. 6574-6577.  aAnion-templated aqueous self-assembly resulted in the formation of an endohedrally functionalized Feᴵᴵ₄L₄ tetrahedron from azaphosphatrane-based subcomponents.

In order to quantify the EU and ε values, optical absorption spectroscopy, Raman scattering, and dielectric measurements have been carried out. The dielectric experiments suggest a decrease in ε values, whereas a systematic increase in the values of EU has been observed with Cr doping. It is shown that EU exhibits inverse square dependence with ε (EU ∼ 1/ε²) up to a certain fraction of Cr (<20%), which is found to be consistent with the quantitative relation obtained by the Bohr-like model. The present investigation explores quantitatively the relationship between ε and EU, which has significant importance for improving the dielectric and optical properties in strongly correlated systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3adielectric properties 3aenergy 3amodels 3aphysical chemistry1 aRambadey, Omkar V.1 aSagdeo, P.

The aim of this study was to characterize seedling and adult plant leaf rust resistance of a world wheat collection. Using controlled inoculation with ten races of Puccinia triticina, 14 seedling resistance genes were determined or postulated to be present in the collection. Lr1, Lr3, Lr10 and Lr20 were the most prevalent genes around the world while Lr9, Lr14b, Lr3ka and/or Lr30 and Lr26 were rare. To confirm some gene postulations, the collection was screened with gene-specific molecular markers for Lr1, Lr10, Lr21 and Lr34. Although possessing the Lr1 and/or Lr10 gene-specific marker, 51 accessions showed unexpected high infection types to P. triticina race BBBD. The collection was tested in the field, where rust resistance ranged from nearly immune or highly resistant with severity of 1 % and resistant host response to highly susceptible with severity of 84 % and susceptible host response. The majority of the accessions possessing the adult plant resistance (APR) gene Lr34 had a maximum rust severity of 0–35 %, similar to or better than accession RL6058, a Thatcher-Lr34 near-isogenic line. Many accessions displayed an immune response or a high level of resistance under field conditions, likely as a result of synergy between APR genes or between APR and seedling resistance genes. However, accessions with three or more seedling resistance genes had an overall lower field severity than those with two or fewer. Immune or highly resistant accessions are potential sources for improvement of leaf rust resistance. In addition, some lines were postulated to have known but unidentified genes/alleles or novel genes, also constituting potentially important sources of novel resistance.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPuccinia recondita 3aadults 3aalleles 3agenetic markers 3agenetic resistance 3aimmune response 3aleaf rust 3araces 3aseedlings 3awheat1 aMcCallum, Brent D.1 aRadovanovic, Natasa1 aCloutier, Sylvie0 tMolecular breeding.g2013 Oct., v. 32, no. 3 p.663-677dSpringer-VerlagwJournal:jnl53942x1380-37437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11032-013-9899-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02571naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002800154245011500182300001600297520153500313592002801848650001901876650001801895650003201913650001701945650002101962651001101983700002101994700001702015773009302032856008802125990002302213852000902236655001202245IND60099384220221123013329.0141105e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009938422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.habitatint.2011.10.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKatusiimeh, Mesharch W.14aThe operations and effectiveness of public and private provision of solid waste collection services in Kampala  ap. 247-252.  aThis paper compares the operations and discusses the effectiveness of public and private sector provision of solid waste collection in Kampala, Uganda. Household data suggest that the private sector is more effective than the public sector. Private sector companies provide services like container provision and providing timely and fixed collection time tables. Contrary to popular perception, fees charged by private companies are moderate. Public sector clients are charged fees even when the service is supposed to be free. Clients of private sector providers are more satisfied than those of public sector providers. It is however, revealed that while public sector serve mainly the low incomes, the private sector serves mainly the rich. In spite of these notable differences, clients of both public and private sector perceive the problem of solid waste management (SWM) in Kampala to be very serious. The effectiveness of public and private sector operations in solid waste collection in Kampala is hampered by corruption and lack of transparency. Given the situation of open competition for clients involving both public and private sector in Kampala, it is possible the public sector can operate effectively if they start commercial services officially like their private sector counterparts. This calls for a formal public-private partnership where the public and private sector can work together with the public sector dominating poor and marginalized areas while the private sector concentrates on rich neighborhoods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aprivate sector 3apublic sector 3apublic-private partnerships 3asolid wastes 3awaste management 3aUganda1 aMol, Arthur P.J.1 aBurger, Kees0 tHabitat international.g2012 Apr., v. 36, no. 2 p.247-252dElsevier Ltdx0197-39757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.habitatint.2011.10.0023Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01590naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245010700160300002000267520060500287592002800892650001100920650002200931650001000953650001300963650003100976650001501007700002401022700002301046773012401069856007401193852000901267655001201276IND60667287420221119150014.0190919e20150323xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066728742DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra00023h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRathore, Neelam10aGrowth of a polarity controlled ZnO nanorod array on a glass/FTO substrate by chemical bath deposition  ap. 28251-28257.  aWe present a polarity controlled ZnO nanorod thin film deposition on a glass substrate by Chemical Bath Deposition (CBD).

Multispectral imagery from optical passive sensors is commonly used to estimate fire damage, yet this type of data is only sensitive to the effects in the upper canopy. This paper evaluates the sensitivity of full waveform LiDAR data to estimate the severity of wildfires using a 3D radiative transfer model approach. The approach represents the first attempt to evaluate the effect of different fire impacts, i.e. changes in vegetation structure as well as soil and leaf color, on the LiDAR signal. The FLIGHT 3D radiative transfer model was employed to simulate full waveform data for 10 plots representative of Mediterranean ecosystems along with a wide range of post-fire scenarios characterized by different severity levels, as defined by the composite burn index (CBI). A new metric is proposed, the waveform area relative change (WARC), which provides a comprehensive severity assessment considering all strata and accounting for changes in structure and leaf and soil color. It showed a strong correlation with CBI values (Spearman's Rho = 0.9 ± 0.02), outperforming the relative change of LiDAR metrics commonly applied for vegetation modeling, such as the relative height of energy quantiles (Spearman's Rho = 0.56 ± 0.07, for the relative change of RH60, the second strongest correlation). Logarithmic models fitted for each plot based on the WARC yielded very good performance with R² (± standard deviation) and RMSE (± standard deviation) of 0.8 (± 0.05) and 0.22 (± 0.03), respectively. LiDAR metrics were evaluated over the King Fire, California, U.S., for which pre- and post-fire discrete return airborne LiDAR data were available. Pseudo-waveforms were computed after radiometric normalization of the intensity data. The WARC showed again the strongest correlation with field measures of GeoCBI values (Spearman's Rho = 0.91), closely followed by the relative change of RH40 (Spearman's Rho = 0.89). The logarithmic model fitted using WARC offered an R² of 0.78 and a RMSE of 0.37. The accurate results obtained for the King Fire, with very different vegetation characteristics compared to our simulated data, demonstrate the robustness of the new metric proposed and its generalization capabilities to estimate the severity of fires.  aPublisher supplied data 3acanopy 3acolor 3aenvironment 3afire damage 3aland management 3aleaves 3alidar 3amodels 3amultispectral imagery 3aradiative transfer 3aradiometry 3asoil color 3astandard deviation 3avegetation 3aCalifornia 0aRadiative transfer models 0aFull waveform simulation 0aFire effects 0aSeverity 0aKing Fire1 aNorth, Peter1 aViana-Soto, Alba1 aStavros, Natasha E.1 aRosette, Jackie1 aMartín, M.

Here, we used ecological niche modelling approaches to explore and evaluate climate change effects on potential geographic distributions of plants of the threatened West‐Central African genus Talbotiella. Our models showed that suitability was lower in the northern parts of its range in West Africa and at it's southern extremes in West‐Central Africa. Areas of West Africa between Liberia and southwestern Ghana were identified as potentially suitable areas where new populations or species of the genus could be discovered. Our model transfers to future conditions showed range shifts and contractions in the geographic distribution of the genus; species of the genus are threatened by additional factors such as habitat loss or degradation, agriculture and development of industrial infrastructure. Although species of the genus will likely persist in protected areas, conservation efforts should also include ex situ conservation approaches, particularly as regards individual species in the genus. This study shows how niche modelling approaches could be used to enhance the conservation and discovery of African biodiversity.  aPublisher supplied data  cBiodiversity Information for Development (BID) and JRS Biodiversity Foundation 3aTalbotiella 3abiodiversity 3aclimate change 3aconservation status 3aex situ conservation 3aextinction 3ageographical distribution 3ahabitat destruction 3ainfrastructure 3aniches 3aGhana 3aLiberia1 aJiménez‐García, Daniel1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2237-33051 aTownsend Peterson, Andrew1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0243-23790 tAfrican journal of ecology.g2021 June, v. 59, no. 2 p.479-488dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl31087x0141-67077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/aje.128453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03251naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005400151245012600205520164200331592002801973650001502001650001202016650001102028650001402039650002102053650002202074650001702096650001802113650001002131650001302141650001902154650001702173650001502190650001102205650001902216650001902235650001502254650001702269653003202286653003202318653002202350653001202372653002702384700001702411700001202428700001702440700005602457773011302513856008602626852000902712655001202721IND60749086220221121190909.0220809e20211015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074908622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1288032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0078-621010aS-doped carbon nanosheets supported ZnO with enhanced visible-light photocatalytic performance for pollutants degradation  aThe exploration of highly efficient and stable visible-light-driven photocatalysts remains a great challenge for organic pollutant management. Herein, a novel S-doped carbon nanosheet (SCN)/ZnO composite photocatalyst has been synthesized via a facile method using the freeze-drying cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) as the carbon precursor. The surface morphology and chemical environment of SCNs can be regulated simultaneously with S-doping. Compared to the pristine carbonized CNCs (CN), the SCN carbonized at 550 °C (SCN-550) has regular nanosheet-like morphology, integrated graphitic structures (ID/IG of 0.692), rich surface heteroatoms (14.62 at% for O, 1.93 at% for S), and most content of oxidized-S atoms (100 at%). It endows the increased surface reactive sites (specific surface area of 45.55 m² g⁻¹), accelerated electron transfer, enhanced visible-light absorption, and prolonged carrier lifetime for the corresponding SCN-550/ZnO composite. Consequently, the SCN-550/ZnO shows an outstanding photocatalytic performance for methylene blue (99%). In addition, SCN-550/ZnO composite exhibits general application to organic contaminants, including phenol (91%), formaldehyde (92%), acetone (79%), and methyl alcohol (84%), respectively. Furthermore, the strong interaction of Zn–O–C covalent bond between SCN-550 and ZnO ensures the high photocatalytic activity of SCN-550/ZnO composite after four cycles, demonstrating its excellent reusability and stability. This study develops a highly efficient visible-light photocatalyst of CNCs derived S-doped carbon nanosheets supported ZnO for environment purification.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aacetone 3acarbon 3acellulose 3achemical bonding 3aelectron transfer 3aformaldehyde 3afreeze drying 3alight 3amethanol 3amethylene blue 3ananocrystals 3ananosheets 3aphenol 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3apollutants 3asurface area 0aOrganic pollutant treatment 0aVisible-light photocatalyst 0aCarbon nanosheets 0aS-doped 0aCellulose nanocrystals1 aZhao, Guomin1 aGan, Lu1 aLian, Hailan1 aPan, Mingzhu1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1907-05540 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 Oct. 15, v. 319 p.128803-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1288033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02671naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245008700164500001900251520155000270592002801820650001101848650001601859650002101875650002601896650001601922650002301938650001601961653003601977653001002013653001502023653001802038653001902056700001602075773011502091856008202206852000902288655001202297IND60696887120221119070015.0210401e20200915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069688712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rse.2020.1118962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Ruonan10aRecent declines in global water vapor from MODIS products: Artifact or real trend?  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAtmospheric water vapor plays a key role in the global water and energy cycles. Accurate estimation of water vapor and consistent representation of its spatial-temporal variation are critical to climate analysis and model validation. This study used ground observational data from global radiosonde and sunphotometer networks to evaluate MODIS (MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) precipitable water vapor (PWV) products for 2000–2017. The products included the thermal-infrared (TIR) (Collection 6, C006) and its updated version (Collection 061, C061), and near-infrared (NIR) products (C061). Our results demonstrated that compared to its earlier version subject to sensor crosstalk problem, the C061_TIR data showed improved accuracy in terms of bias, standard deviation, mean absolute error, root mean square error, and coefficient of determination, regression slope and intercept. Among the PWV products, C061_NIR data achieved the best overall performance in accuracy evaluation. The C061_NIR revealed the PWV had a multi-year average of 2.50 ± 0.08 cm for the globe, 2.03 ± 0.06 cm for continents, and 2.70 ± 0.09 cm for oceans in 2000–2017. The PWV values yielded an increasing rate of 0.015 cm/year for the globe, 0.010 cm/year for continents, and 0.017 cm/year for oceans. Nearly 98.95% of the globe showed an increasing trend, 80.74% of statistical significance, mainly distributed within and around the tropical zones. The findings should be valuable for understanding of global water and energy cycles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy 3aenvironment 3amodel validation 3aobservational studies 3aphotometers 3astandard deviation 3awater vapor 0aGlobal precipitable water vapor 0aMODIS 0aRadiosonde 0aSunphotometer 0aClimate change1 aLiu, Yuanbo0 tRemote sensing of environment.g2020 Sept. 15, v. 247 p.111896-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11735x0034-42577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2020.1118963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02437naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001800154245011800172300001600290520139400306592002801700650001101728650003001739650002501769650001501794650002201809650001301831651001301844651001201857651001701869773009301886856008801979990002302067852000902090655001202099IND60099384620221123025910.0141105e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009938462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.habitatint.2011.06.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNjoh, Ambe J.10aImplications of spatial and physical structures for ICT as a tool of urban management and development in Cameroon  ap. 343-351.  aInformation and communication technologies (ICTs) hold enormous promise for development efforts in developing countries. However, the potential of ICTs remains untapped for reasons that are largely unknown in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). This region has the lowest level of ICT penetration in the world. The need to understand impediments to ICT performance are therefore most urgent in this region. This paper seeks to address this need by identifying factors that inhibit the functionality of ICT as a tool for improving urban management. It analyzes two cities in the region, namely Douala and Yaounde, respectively Cameroon’s economic/cultural and politico-administrative capitals. The following three factors are shown to impede the functioning of ICT devices, hence urban management in these cities: colonial racial segregation policies, the colonial legacy of land use compartmentalization and the lack of unambiguous physical addresses for structures in the built environment. It is suggested that concerned authorities institute the following measures. 1] Establish an unambiguous addressing system reposed on the municipal governance structure and the country’s vehicle matriculation taxonomy. 2] Actively promote ICT as an element of national development. Finally, it presents some examples of efforts to improve ICT penetration and functionality from Senegal and South Africa.  aPublisher supplied data 3acities 3acommunications technology 3adeveloping countries 3agovernance 3aissues and policy 3aland use 3aCameroon 3aSenegal 3aSouth Africa0 tHabitat international.g2012 July, v. 36, no. 3 p.343-351dElsevier Ltdx0197-39757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.habitatint.2011.06.0063Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03413naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006100147245008500208500001900293520196200312592002802274650001502302650001702317650001202334650002302346650001402369650001602383650001602399650002502415650001502440651001802455653003002473653001002503653003102513653002602544653002502570653003302595653001002628653001002638653001502648700002002663700002002683700002202703773011502725856008202840852000902922655001202931IND60696887220221119070451.0210401e20200915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069688722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rse.2020.1118972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoreno, M.

Analysis of satellite-derived burned areas has allowed the identification of fire patches and their morphology as a new resource for tracking fire spread to improve fire models used to assess the impact of fires on climate and the carbon cycle. A critical parameter of the flood-fill algorithm used to create fire patches is the cut-off (in days) below which it aggregates two contiguous burned pixels to the same fire patch. However, the current level of validation is insufficient to understand the effect of the cut-off values and sensor resolutions on the subsequent fire-patch morphology. The FRY v1.0 database of functional fire-patch traits (e.g., size, elongation, and direction) emanates from the analyses of two global burned-area products derived from MODIS and MERIS sensors with different spatial and temporal resolutions and with cut-off values of 3, 5, 9, and 14 days. To evaluate whether the FRY products are accurately identifying the spatial features of fire patches and what are the most realistic cut-off values to use in different sub-regions of North America, we propose a new functional diversity trait-based approach, which compares the satellite-derived fire patches to forest service perimeters as reference data. This paper shows the accuracy of the FRY fire patches ≥300 ha in North America during 2005–2011. Our analysis demonstrates that fire patches with a high cut-off of 14 days and those derived from the MODIS sensor, with their high temporal resolution, better identify the fire diversity in North America. In conclusion, our statistical framework can be used for assessing satellite-derived fire patches. Furthermore, the temporal resolution of satellite sensors is the most important factor in identifying fire patches — thus space agencies should consider it when planning the future development of cost-effective climate observation systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acarbon cycle 3aclimate 3acost effectiveness 3adatabases 3aenvironment 3afire spread 3afunctional diversity 3asatellites 3aNorth America 0aFunctional Beta Diversity 0aDGVMs 0aEssential Climate Variable 0aFire-Patch Morphology 0aFlood-Fill Algorithm 0aFunctional Diversity Indices 0aMERIS 0aMODIS 0aValidation1 aLaurent, Pierre1 aCiais, Philippe1 aMouillot, Florent0 tRemote sensing of environment.g2020 Sept. 15, v. 247 p.111897-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11735x0034-42577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2020.1118973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01403naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245011800163300001800281500001900299520032600318592002800644650001900672650001400691650001100705650001700716700002800733700001800761700002300779700002700802700002100829773013200850856007400982852000901056655001201065IND60726244420221122094752.0210203e20210202xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072624442DNAL7 a10.1039/d0cc07142k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBahmanpour, Ali M.10aIncreasing the activity of the Cu/CuAl₂O₄/Al₂O₃ catalyst for the RWGS through preserving the Cu²⁺ ions  ap. 1153-1156.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aCu–Al spinel oxide is a highly active catalyst for CO₂ conversion to CO.

Of those that have ascribed the importance of canopy structure to stemflow production, there has been a bias towards field studies. Coupling Bayesian inference with the NIED (National Research Institute for Earth Science and Disaster Resilience, Tsukuba, Japan) large‐scale rainfall simulator, this study leveraged a unique opportunity to control rainfall amounts and intensities to pinpoint the canopy structural metrics that differentially influence stemflow funnelling ratios for three common tree species between leafed and leafless canopy states. For the first time, we examined whether canopy structure metrics exert a static control on stemflow funnelling ratios or whether different elements of canopy structure are more or less important under leafed or leafless states, thereby allowing us to determine if tacit assumptions about the static influence of canopy structure on stemflow production (and funnelling) are valid (or not). Rainfall simulations were conducted at 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 100 mm h⁻¹ under both leafed and leafless tree conditions (12 simulations in total) to detect any differential effects on the presence or absence of foliage on stemflow funnelling ratios. For leafed conditions, the highest percentages of best‐fitting models (ΔDIC ≤2) indicated that stemflow funnelling ratios were mainly controlled by total dry aboveground biomass (Bₐₗₗ), diameter at breast height (DBH), total dry foliar biomass (Bf), tree height (H), and woody to foliar dry biomass ratio (BR). Whilst for the leafless state, the highest percentages of best‐fitting models (ΔDIC ≤2) indicated that total dry branch biomass (Bbᵣ) was relatively dominant as was the interaction effects between crown projection area and species (CPA:species). These results compel us to reject any assumption of a static effect of different elements of canopy structure on stemflow funnelling.  aPublisher supplied data  aS16088cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science  a1247312cNational Science Foundation 3aBayesian theory 3aJapan 3aaboveground biomass 3acanopy 3ahydrology 3aleaves 3arain 3arainfall simulation 3aresearch institutions 3astemflow 3atree and stand measurements 3atree height 3atrees1 aWheeler, Kathryn I.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3931-74891 aNanko, Kazuki1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1157-92871 aShinohara, Yoshinori1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9118-02431 aSun, Xinchao1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8267-99741 aSakai, Naoki1 aLevia, Delphis F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7443-65230 tHydrological processes.g2021 Aug., v. 35, no. 8 p.e14294-dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl3938466x0885-60877nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.142943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03008naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245014800155500001400303520147800317592002801795650001901823650002001842650001501862650001601877650001401893650002001907650001001927650001601937650003001953650002101983650001502004650001602019650001702035650002002052650001302072700002002085700002002105700002002125700002102145700001902166700001902185700002002204700002002224700002202244700001802266773012302284856007402407852000902481655001202490IND60711795120221121125501.0200928e20200912xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071179512DNAL7 a10.3390/nu120927992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Yiwen,10aCompositional and Functional Adaptations of Intestinal Microbiota and Related Metabolites in CKD Patients Receiving Dietary Protein Restriction  aNAL-light  aThe relationship between change of gut microbiota and host serum metabolomics associated with low protein diet (LPD) has been unraveled incompletely in CKD patients. Fecal 16S rRNA gene sequencing and serum metabolomics profiling were performed. We reported significant changes in the β-diversity of gut microbiota in CKD patients having LPD (CKD-LPD, n = 16). We identified 19 genera and 12 species with significant differences in their relative abundance among CKD-LPD patients compared to patients receiving normal protein diet (CKD-NPD, n = 27) or non-CKD controls (n = 34), respectively. CKD-LPD had a significant decrease in the abundance of many butyrate-producing bacteria (family Lachnospiraceae and Bacteroidaceae) associated with enrichment of functional module of butanoate metabolism, leading to concomitant reduction in serum levels of SCFA (acetic, heptanoic and nonanoic acid). A secondary bile acid, glyco λ-muricholic acid, was significantly increased in CKD-LPD patients. Serum levels of indoxyl sulfate and p-cresyl sulfate did not differ among groups. The relationship between abundances of microbes and metabolites remained significant in subset of resampling subjects of comparable characteristics. Enrichment of bacterial gene markers related to D-alanine, ketone bodies and glutathione metabolism was noted in CKD-LPD patients. Our analyses reveal signatures and functions of gut microbiota to adapt dietary protein restriction in renal patients.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacteroidaceae 3aLachnospiraceae 3abile acids 3ablood serum 3abutyrates 3adietary protein 3agenes 3aglutathione 3aintestinal microorganisms 3alow protein diet 3ametabolism 3ametabolites 3ametabolomics 3apelargonic acid 3asulfates1 aLee, Chin-Chan 1 aHsu, Heng-Jung 1 aSun, Chiao-Yin 1 aChen, Yuen-Chan 1 aYang, Kai-Jie 1 aYang, Chi-Wei 1 aChung, Wen-Hun 1 aLai, Hsin-Chih 1 aChang, Lun-Ching 1 aSu, Shih-Chi 0 tNutrients.g2020 Sept. 12, v. 12, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu120927993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03443naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005400144245017300198300002000371520127700391592002801668596009801696596009801794596010501892596010401997596005402101650001402155650001602169650001202185650001102197650001802208650002502226650002802251650002502279650001602304650002402320653002502344653002402369653002702393653002202420700001402442700001802456700001402474700005102488700001602539700001402555700001702569700001502586700005802601773014202659856007902801852000902880655001202889IND60793363720221116185519.0220914e20220831xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079336372DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.2c089512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuo, Jiali1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4130-703910aCollagenase-Loaded H-TiO₂ Nanoparticles Enhance Ultrasound Imaging-Guided Sonodynamic Therapy in a Pancreatic Carcinoma Xenograft Model via Digesting Stromal Barriers  ap. 40535-40545.  aSonodynamic therapy (SDT), a noninvasive therapy that relies on sonosensitizers and generates reactive oxygen species (ROS), has attracted considerable attention in the treatment of pancreatic cancer. However, being surrounded by dense stromal barriers, pancreatic cancer exhibits high interstitial fluid pressure (IFP) and hypoxia in the tumor microenvironment (TME), resulting in poor SDT efficacy. Collagenase-loaded hollow TiO₂ (Col-H-TiO₂) nanoparticles (NPs) capable of degrading stromal barriers and producing sufficient ROS production were synthesized in this study. After administration of NPs in the patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model, ultrasonic irradiation-released collagenase degraded tumor matrix fibers, decreased intratumoral IFP, and enhanced the penetration and retention of NPs within tumor tissues. Moreover, the NPs accumulated within the tumor not only generate abundant ROS under the influence of ultrasound irradiation but also improve intratumoral ultrasound signal, providing ultrasonic imaging-guided highly effective SDT for pancreatic cancer. In conclusion, this research improves the SDT technique and enhances the visualization of pancreatic cancer by remodeling the TME and is a promising strategy for further clinical applications.  aPublisher supplied data  a81901871cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a82030048cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  aLGF19C100001cNatural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Provincedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100004731  aLQ19H180004cNatural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Provincedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100004731  a2019C03077cZhejiang Provincedhttps://doi.org/NA 3acarcinoma 3acollagenase 3ahypoxia 3amodels 3ananoparticles 3apancreatic neoplasms 3areactive oxygen species 3aultrasonic treatment 3aultrasonics 3axenotransplantation 0aextracellular matrix 0asonodynamic therapy 0atumor microenvironment 0apancreatic cancer1 aCao, Jing1 aMa, Guangrong1 aWang, Xue1 aSun, Yu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4539-80891 aZhang, Cong1 aShi, Zhan1 aZeng, Yiqing1 aZhang, Tao1 aHuang, Pintong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0747-57650 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2022 Aug. 31, v. 14, no. 36 p.40535-40545dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.2c089513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03274naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245011800165500001900283520192200302592002802224650001502252650001602267650001602283650001402299650001502313650001102328650001502339650002902354650001602383651001002399653001502409653001402424653002002438653003102458653002702489653002702516700001802543700001502561700001702576700001702593773011502610856008202725852000902807655001202816IND60696887320221119070012.0210401e20200915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069688732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rse.2020.1118992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJia, Hongying10aImproved offset tracking for predisaster deformation monitoring of the 2018 Jinsha River landslide (Tibet, China)  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSynthetic aperture radar (SAR) remote sensing is a potential technique for long-term monitoring of landslide-prone areas. Pixel offset tracking methods work well for fast-moving landslides (more than tens of cm/yr). However, existing methods may present some limitations, such as (i) a high dependence of estimation window design on experience, (ii) a tradeoff between the accuracy of single points and the overall efficiency, and (iii) a low confidence in the results caused by heterogeneous in-window samples. In this paper, an improved offset tracking method is proposed to address these problems. First, the workflow is optimized by a “preseparation” step added before offset estimation to distinguish between feature matching and speckle pattern matching. The optimized workflow is more efficient for natural scenes containing both feature and non-saliency regions. Second, an improved algorithm called adaptive incoherence speckle offset tracking based on homogeneous samples (AISOT-HS) is proposed for non-saliency regions. Its two key points are (i) adaptive design of the optimal estimation windows by introducing a coherence map as a guide and (ii) offset estimation without heterogeneous samples. We apply the proposed method to study the evolution of the 2018 Jinsha River landslide (Tibet, China) using SAR data from the Gaofen 3 (GF-3) satellite and the Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar-2 (PALSAR-2) system onboard the Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) satellite. Compared with the traditional method, the proposed method improves the efficiency and reduces the uncertainty. We also analyze the spatiotemporal displacement pattern of this landslide, which shows that the Jinsha River landslide was most likely a thrust load-caused landslide. This study demonstrates the role of SAR remote sensing in global landslide monitoring, especially where ground truth data are scarce.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3adeformation 3aenvironment 3aevolution 3alandslides 3arivers 3asatellites 3asynthetic aperture radar 3auncertainty 3aChina 0aSAR images 0aLandslide 0aOffset tracking 0aAdaptive estimation window 0aDeformation monitoring 0aFailure mode deduction1 aWang, Yingjie1 aGe, Daqing1 aDeng, Yunkai1 aWang, Robert0 tRemote sensing of environment.g2020 Sept. 15, v. 247 p.111899-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11735x0034-42577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2020.1118993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02648naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006000151245015600211520119400367592002801561650002501589650001601614650001101630650002101641650002401662650001101686650001501697650001701712650002601729650001101755650001101766650001101777650001501788650002501803653001501828653001201843653001401855653002401869653002901893700007201922773011301994856008602107852000902193655001202202IND60749086720221121190927.0211206e20211020xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074908672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1288082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTikariha, Hitesh1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0103-625410aGenomic adaptation and metabolic hierarchy: Microbial community response to oxygen stress in community derived from sludge treating refinery wastewater  aThe complexity of the metabolic networks in a microbial community is decided by the heterogeneity of available carbon sources such as in refinery wastewater treatment plants. The organic loading due to diverse hydrocarbons could be shunted in the metabolic network through different oxygenase's which work on different redox levels. In this study, the three different bioreactors in the continuous mode were set up with different dissolved oxygen (DO) levels with phenol as a representative carbon source. To understand the metabolic diversity, co-assembly from metagenome data was done leading to generation of 27 high-quality genomes which together represent 70% of the community. Clustering at various functional levels along with genomic abundance shows the existence of functional hierarchy in the community. Genomic comparison revealed the various scenarios of genomic adaptation and existence of metabolic plasticity which all together increases the community metabolic capacity. The whole experimental design combined with genome level functional entanglement between community member serve as a method for improvement of wastewater treatment processes under perturbing conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiochemical pathways 3abioreactors 3acarbon 3adissolved oxygen 3aexperimental design 3agenome 3ametabolism 3ametagenomics 3amicrobial communities 3aoxygen 3aphenol 3asludge 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 0aMetagenome 0aBinning 0aOxygenase 0aMicrobial community 0aHorizontal gene transfer1 aPurohit, H.

Depending on the degree of interaction between polymers and water, different proton populations could be distinguished. The starch protons in the starch–water model gain mobility owing to amylopectin crystal melting, granule swelling, and amylose leaching, whereas water protons lose mobility due to increased interaction with starch polymers. Heating of the gluten–water sample induces no pronounced changes in proton distributions. Heating changes the proton distributions of the flour–water and starch–water models in a similar way, implying that the changes are primarily attributable to starch gelatinization. Proton distributions of the heated flour–water model system and those of fresh bread crumb are very similar. This allows identifying the different proton populations in bread on the basis of the results from the model systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamylopectin 3aamylose 3abread dough 3abreads 3agelatinization 3agluten 3aheat treatment 3aleaching 3amelting 3amodels 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apolymers 3aprotons 2aBreadxanalysis 2aFlourxanalysis 2aGlutensxchemistry 2aMagnetic Resonance Spectroscopyxmethods 2aModels, Chemical 2aMolecular Structure 2aStarchxchemistry 2aTriticumxchemistry 0aproton mobility 0alow-resolution proton nuclear magnetic resonance 0astarch gelatinization 0agluten polymerization 0adough 0abread1 aLagrain, Bert1 aDeleu, Lomme

Participants were categorised into two groups according to the mothers’ total JGNKQ scores. Adolescents’ dietary habits during the preceding month were assessed using a brief self-administered diet history questionnaire. Inadequacy of each nutrient intake was assessed using the cut-point method, which showed that 14 nutrients were below “estimated average requirement (EAR)” and five nutrients were outside the range of “tentative dietary goal to prevent lifestyle-related diseases (DG)”. In the habitual daily nutrient intakes and the proportion of nutrient intake inadequacy of the students, no differences were observed according to mother’s nutritional knowledge level. Our findings suggest that mothers’ nutrition knowledge may not be directly associated with adolescents’ nutrient intake among Japanese junior high school student–mother dyads.  aPublisher supplied data 3aJapan 3aadolescence 3aadolescents 3aadulthood 3across-sectional studies 3aears 3afood frequency questionnaires 3ahealthy diet 3anutrient intake 3anutrition knowledge1 aHatamoto, Yoichi 1 aMasumoto, Ayumi 1 aSakamoto, Azusa 1 aIkemoto, Shinji 0 tNutrients.g2020 Sept. 13, v. 12, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu120928013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01442naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245006400163300001800227520059400245592002800839650001200867650001900879650001000898700002100908700001800929773013400947856007401081852000901155655001201164IND60661333720221121225158.0190829e20110815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066133372DNAL7 a10.1039/c0cs00206b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBothwell, Jason M.10aApplications of bismuth(iii) compounds in organic synthesis  ap. 4649-4707.  aThis review article summarizes the applications of bismuth(iii) compounds in organic synthesis since 2002.

In this study, we used admission records from January 2015 to December 2016 to review the causes for raptor admissions to a raptor rehabilitation centre in Pietermaritzburg, South Africa, and to determine factors that can be used to predict the outcome of rehabilitation. During the study period, 242 raptors were admitted to the centre, representing 33 species. The major causes of admission were collision‐related injuries (52%), grounded birds (12%) and orphaned chicks (10%). The most common casualties were spotted eagle‐owl Bubo africanus (23%), yellow‐billed kite Milvus migrans aegyptius/parasitus (12%), jackal buzzard Buteo rufofuscus (10%) and western barn owl Tyto alba (10%). The rehabilitation centre had a release rate of 48%. Reason for admission was a significant predictor of the outcome of rehabilitation while other variables were not. Raptors with no severe injuries such as orphaned chicks and grounded birds were more likely to have successful rehabilitation treatment than raptors suffering from collision injuries. Wildlife rehabilitators can use the results of the present study to develop triage guidelines for raptors admitted to rehabilitation centres.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Research Foundation (ZA)  cInyuvesi Yakwazulu‐Natali  cHawk Mountain Sanctuary Association 3aBubo 3aButeo 3aMilvus migrans 3aTyto alba 3ainformation sources 3ajackals 3awildlife 3aSouth Africa1 aMonadjem, Ara1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1906-40231 aBildstein, Keith L.1 aHoffman, Benjamin,c(Lawyer)1 aDowns, Colleen1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8334-15100 tAfrican journal of ecology.g2021 June, v. 59, no. 2 p.510-517dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl31087x0141-67077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/aje.128513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02686naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001900188245009100207300001100298506007600309520143800385592002801823506003701851650002701888650001101915650001301926650001201939650001501951650001301966650003501979650003402014650001202048650001202060650001302072773011302085856008102198852000902279655001202288IND60585577820221207102804.0171214e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058557782DNAL7 a10.1186/s12302-017-0126-92doi7 aPMC56804032pmcid7 a291707232pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrinz, Raimund10aHomologue distribution patterns of 2,3,7,8-chloro-substituted PCDD/F in Bavarian soils  ap. 28.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Soil-background values of PCDD/F concentrations are usually conveniently displayed as toxic equivalent (TEq), being a bulk parameter of all relevant 7 PCDD- and 10 PCDF-congeneres, chloro-subsidized at the 2nd, 3rd, 7th and 8th carbon atom. Data here are ample, not so survey on congenere/homologue patterns occurring in soils. The sufficient number of samples taken within this analysis allowed first a well-grounded evaluation. RESULTS: OCDD proved to be the dominant congenere in all samples (forest and agriculture), however, in considerably different concentrations. As expected, highest level was detected in forest organic layers, followed by forest top soils, cropland- and grassland top soils. Although highest in concentration, OCDD only contributes to 0.17% (both forest organic- and top soil layer), respectively, 0.4% (cropland) and 0.3% (grassland) to TEq. The influence of lower chlorinated homologues on TEq is strongest in forest top soils (72%) followed by 67% (forest organic layers), cropland top soil (63%) and grassland (61%). Although all homologue patterns (forest and agriculture) give a fairly similar picture, a test of significance (χ ²) proved a different population of forest samples. CONCLUSIONS: The resemblance of the homologue patterns throughout all utilization suggests that agent levels are explained mainly by diffuse atmospheric depositions rather than by specific land use input.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aatmospheric deposition 3acarbon 3acropland 3aforests 3agrasslands 3aland use 3apolychlorinated dibenzodioxins 3apolychlorinated dibenzofurans 3asurveys 3atopsoil 3atoxicity0 tEnvironmental sciences Europe.g2017 Dec., v. 29, no. 1 p.28-28dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx2190-47077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12302-017-0126-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02996naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002100146245008800167300001800255500001900273520186600292592002802158650000802186650001502194650002302209650001502232650001302247650002202260650002302282650001402305650001302319700002302332700005402355773013602409856008002545852000902625655001202634IND60733730320221116212002.0210411e20210329xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073373032DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c003932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPinca, Justin R.10aIon Association and Electrolyte Structure at Surface Films in Lithium-Ion Batteries  ap. 7054-7066.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aDuring lithium-ion battery charging and discharging, carbonate electrolytes degrade from redox side reactions to produce electrode surface films. The composition of these films depends on the composition of the electrolyte layer at the electrode surface and the structure of the ion solvation shells found therein. However, both the composition and structure of an electrolyte at an interface can vary significantly from their counterparts in the bulk, as reported previously at air and mineral surfaces. Hence, a circular relationship holds in which the surface films formed depend on the electrolyte structure, which in turn is impacted by the presence of the surface film. In this work, three impacts from solid interfaces on carbonate electrolytes are considered: ion accumulation, ion pairing, and solvent exchange dynamics. By considering these effects at four different surfaces of varying solvent affinities (LiF, Li₂CO₃, Li₂EDC, and graphite), we explore the impact of solvent–surface interactions and ion–surface interactions on these interfacial behaviors. Classical molecular dynamics provides a route to explore the molecular structure at the electrolyte boundary, and two different electrolytes are considered to investigate the role of ion association on the accumulation, pairing, and dynamics. By considering the changes as a result of switching between one electrolyte with mostly solvent-separated ions to another with contact ion pairs, we provide evidence that both bulk ion association and the solvent–surface interaction are key descriptors of ion aggregation at the electrode surface. The insights from these simulations inform not only about the impacts of battery interfaces on the surrounding electrolyte but also on the origins of differences reported between classical molecular dynamics simulations at these interfaces.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3acarbonates 3achemical structure 3aelectrodes 3agraphene 3alithium batteries 3amolecular dynamics 3asolvation 3asolvents1 aDuborg, William G.1 aJorn, Ryan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0192-92980 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2021 Mar. 29, v. 125, no. 13 p.7054-7066dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c003933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03351naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005700152245013700209520174800346592002802094650001902122650001502141650001302156650001302169650001502182650001502197650002702212650002402239650001002263650001402273650001402287650002202301650001502323650002902338650001302367650001602380650001502396650003702411651002202448653001302470653002402483653001102507653001202518700006202530700002202592700002702614773009602641856008702737852000902824655001202833IND60750541820221119130403.0211030e20220101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075054182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.geoderma.2021.1154092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOmari, Haneen1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8427-222X12aA spatiotemporal framework reveals contrasting factors shape biocrust microbial and microfaunal communities in the Chihuahuan Desert  aBiocrusts are soil-surface communities composed of autotrophic and heterotrophic microbiota that affect nutrient cycling, plant performance, soil hydrology and stability within drylands. Biocrust community composition is mostly thought to be driven by abiotic factors, but the structure of the bacteria, fungi, protist, and microfauna taxa are rarely documented simultaneously or over time. In this study, we examined the composition, abundance, and diversity of microbes (bacteria and fungi) and microfauna (protists and microscopic microfauna) in three types of biocrusts among two different vegetative habitats in the northern Chihuahuan Desert during three successive seasons. Microbial groups were identified by phospholipid fatty acid analyses (PLFA) and included actinobacteria, gram-positive bacteria, rhizobia, gram-negative bacteria, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, and saprophytic fungi. Microfauna were enumerated via microscopy and included nematodes, tardigrades, rotifers, amoebae, ciliates, and flagellates. We found that microbial communities were most affected by biocrust type, whereas microfaunal communities were more influenced by sampling season. Season was also associated with different indicator taxa. Additionally, microbial communities were related to biocrust chemical properties, which changed with season and surrounding vegetation while microfaunal communities were not. In cyanolichen-dominated crusts, but not others, the structure of microbial and microfaunal communities were strongly correlated. Our study highlights possible food web interactions and provides evidence that the co-occurring microbial and microfaunal taxa associated with biocrusts are temporally dynamic and structured by different drivers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aActinobacteria 3aCiliophora 3aNematoda 3aRotifera 3aTardigrada 3aarid lands 3abiological soil crusts 3acommunity structure 3afauna 3afood webs 3ahydrology 3aindicator species 3amicroscopy 3aphospholipid fatty acids 3aprotists 3asaprophytes 3avegetation 3avesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae 3aChihuahuan Desert 0aBiocrust 0aMicrobial community 0aSeason 0aDryland1 aPietrasiak, Nicole1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4636-80061 aFerrenberg, Scott1 aNishiguchi, Michele K.0 tGeoderma.g2022 Jan. 01, v. 405 p.115409-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl16374x0016-70617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2021.1154093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03152naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005700151245013100208520186600339592002802205650001102233650001902244650002202263650002102285650001902306650001102325650001202336650001502348651001002363653003302373653002002406653002402426653002202450653002202472700001102494700001502505700001402520773011302534856008602647852000902733655001202742IND60749087020221121190925.0211206e20211020xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074908702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1288112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Honghua1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7535-334310aUsing system dynamics to analyse key factors influencing China's energy-related CO2 emissions and emission reduction scenarios  aConsidering the complexity and dynamicity of national energy-related CO₂ emissions, it is necessary to analyse the influencing factors and evaluate the possible impact of relevant emission reduction policies before formulating them. Based on the system dynamics (SD) method, this study proposed a research framework and established a multi-level SD model to comprehensively analyse national energy-related carbon emissions, considering the relationship between factors of society, economic, energy and carbon emissions. The method was applied to the case of China. Firstly, it simulated China's historical emissions and predicted future baseline from 2005 to 2050. Then, based on the sensitivity analysis, the key influencing factors were discerned. Finally, by setting scenarios and introducing causal chains, the model was used to test the effectiveness of different emission reduction measures. The results show that GDP, energy structure and industrial structure have significant impact on energy-related CO₂ emissions. The impact of the population is limited, while that of industrial energy intensity varies in different periods. Without carbon constraints, China's CO₂ emissions will peak by 2043 with the value of 15.2 Gt/year. Enhancing technological innovation in energy efficiency improvement and non-fossil energy is a better choice to reduce carbon emissions at current stage. An integrated measure combining technological innovation, infrastructure construction, resident behaviour improvement and adjustment of industrial structure can effectively advance the carbon peak to 2028, and reduce carbon intensity by 94% by 2050 compared to 2005, which will achieve China's national determined contribution goals. Such information will be important for China's future energy low-carbon transition and will provide suggestions for policy-making.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3aenergy efficiency 3aenergy resources 3ainfrastructure 3amodels 3asociety 3atechnology 3aChina 0aEnergy-related CO2 emissions 0aSystem dynamics 0aInfluencing factors 0aScenario analysis 0aPolicy simulation1 aLi, Xu1 aMa, Linwei1 aLi, Zheng0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 Oct. 20, v. 320 p.128811-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1288113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03301naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001700144245013700161300002000298520119500318592002801513596008401541596012801625596012601753596006901879596007701948650001402025650002802039650001702067650004902084650001802133650001402151650001102165650002502176653002702201653002402228653002602252653002502278653002002303700001602323700005102339700001702390700001302407700005602420700001802476700005802494773014302552856007902695852000902774655001202783IND60793364120221116185250.0220914e20220902xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079336412DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.2c091112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJin, Chengyu10aSpace-Confined Surface Layer in Superstructured Ni–N–C Catalyst for Enhanced Catalytic Degradation of m-Cresol by PMS Activation  ap. 40834-40840.  aThe broad application of peroxymonosulfate (PMS)-assisted oxidation by heterogeneous catalysts for contaminant removal suffers from the limitation of low PMS decomposition efficiency and consequent excessive electrolyte residues. In this work, we report that a micrometer-scale superstructured Ni–N–C catalyst Ni-NCNT/CB with a nanotube-array surface layer exhibits ultrahigh m-cresol removal efficiency with low PMS input and possesses ∼17-fold higher catalytic specific activity (reaction rate constant normalized to per Ni–Nₓ site) compared to the traditional Ni-SAC catalyst. Electron paramagnetic resonance results indicate that ¹O₂ is the dominant oxygen species, and Ni-NCNT/CB with a space-confined layer exhibits high ¹O₂ utilization for m-cresol degradation. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and a normalized k value of Ni-NCNT/CB confirm the spatial confinement effect on the catalyst surface, which is beneficial for regulating the mass transfer and exerting the high activity of active sites. This study gives a new application for spatial confinement, and the configuration of Ni-NCNT/CB may guide a rational catalyst design for AOP wastewater treatment.  aPublisher supplied data  aXDA21021101cChinese Academy of Sciencesdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100002367  a2019YFA0705803cMinistry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100002855  a2020190cYouth Innovation Promotion Association of the Chinese Academy of Sciencesdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100004739  a2021003cYulin Universitydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100019282  a2021003cDalian National Laboratory for Clean Energydhttps://doi.org/NA 3acatalysts 3adielectric spectroscopy 3aelectrolytes 3aelectron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy 3amass transfer 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3awastewater treatment 0aPMS-assisted oxidation 0aspatial confinement 0apollutant degradation 0asingle atom catalyst 0aROS utilization1 aHan, Peiwei1 aLi, Gao1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6649-57961 aZhang, Yanan1 aSun, Hao1 aShen, Wenjie1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3071-95561 aSun, Chenglin1 aWei, Huangzhao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9370-92400 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2022 Sept. 02, v. 14, no. 36 p.40834-40840dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.2c091113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03219naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245009700172520184100269592002802110650002002138650001302158650001702171650001102188650001802199650002502217650001102242650001802253650001802271650002002289650001502309650002002324650001302344650003702357650002102394650001502415650001902430653002502449653001902474653001802493653002002511700002602531773009602557856008702653852000902740655001202749IND60750541920221119130206.0211030e20220101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075054192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.geoderma.2021.1154432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMondal, Surajit10aGlobal meta-analysis suggests that no-tillage favourably changes soil structure and porosity  aRole of soil to meet global food security, sustainable intensification and food nutritional quality has got renewed attention with a larger focus on soil physical condition. No-tillage (NT) practice can essentially contribute to develop a sustainable, low carbon and resource efficient agriculture, and encourage the use of crop residues for added soil benefits. Soil aggregation and pore size distribution, two most important soil physical factors controlling the mass and energy transport processes within the soil and between soil and environment, were evaluated under the NT through a global meta-analysis of 5065 pairs of data points from 419 peer-reviewed studies. Compared to conventional tillage (CT), NT increased mean weight diameter of aggregates, water stable aggregates, and macroaggregates by averages (0–30 cm) of 25, 10 and 22%, respectively, although predominantly in 0–10 and/or 10–20 cm layers, with an accompanying reduction in microaggregates. A small but significant 3% decrease in total porosity, a large reduction (20–32%) in macroporosity and a moderate increase (4–7%) in microporosity were realized under NT up to 20 cm soil depth. Bulk density remained stable, although a very large decrease (70% change over CT) in saturated hydraulic conductivity was recorded in 10–20 and >30 cm soil layers. Years of adoption of NT had an additive effect on mean weight diameter and macroaggregates, and the total and macroporosity. Increase in latitudes favoured soil aggregation and micropore volume under NT, while clay content was unfavourable to macro- and water stable aggregate contents. Improvement in structure and water retention properties relate to long-term sustainable development of soils by following no-till practice, which has far-reaching implications beyond the boundaries of agronomy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadditive effect 3aagronomy 3abulk density 3acarbon 3aclay fraction 3aconventional tillage 3aenergy 3afood security 3ameta-analysis 3amicroaggregates 3ano-tillage 3anutritive value 3aporosity 3asaturated hydraulic conductivity 3asoil aggregation 3asoil depth 3asoil structure 0aMean weight diameter 0aTotal porosity 0aMacroporosity 0aMeta-regression1 aChakraborty, Debashis0 tGeoderma.g2022 Jan. 01, v. 405 p.115443-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl16374x0016-70617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2021.1154433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03028naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100002000156245011500176300001800291520158100309592002801890650002001918650001001938650001501948650002301963650000701986650002301993650001602016650005202032650003102084650002102115650002402136650003102160653002002191653003102211653002002242653002202262653002302284700002102307700002602328773013202354852000902486856007502495655001202570IND4463662520221117080447.0160905e20120530xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446366252DNAL7 a225782562pmid7 a10.1021/jf301258s2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZamora, Rosario10aChemical Conversion of Phenylethylamine into Phenylacetaldehyde by Carbonyl–Amine Reactions in Model Systems  ap. 5491-5496.  aThe chemical conversion of phenylethylamine into phenylacetaldehyde in the presence of lipid oxidation products (LOPs) was studied to investigate the possibility that biogenic amines can be converted into Strecker aldehydes upon processing. Model systems of phenylethylamine and methyl 13-hydroperoxyoctadeca-9,11-dienoate (HP), 2,4-decadienal (DD), 4,5-epoxy-2-heptenal (EH), 4,5-epoxy-2-decenal (ED), 4-oxo-2-hexenal (OH), 4-oxo-2-nonenal (ON), or 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HN) were heated for 1 h at 180 °C and pH 3. Although HN and EH did not produce more phenylacetaldehyde than when phenylethylamine was heated alone, all other lipid oxidation products assayed increased the amount of phenylacetaldehyde produced by 300–900%, with ON being the most reactive compound for this reaction. The reaction was mainly produced at acidic pH values (<6) and was dependent upon the concentration of the LOPs involved, and the phenylacetaldehyde produced increased linearly as a function of the time and temperature. The Eₐ values for the reactions between phenylethylamine and DD and ON were 54.8 and 53.8 kJ/mol, respectively. The reaction is proposed to take place by the formation of an imine between the phenylethylamine and the LOPs, which is later converted into another imine by an electronic rearrangement. This new imine is the origin of phenylacetaldehyde by hydrolysis. These results show a new pathway for Strecker aldehyde formation. This route provides a potential way to reduce biogenic amine content in foods when they can be thermally processed before consumption.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiogenic amines 3afoods 3ahydrolysis 3alipid peroxidation 3apH 3aphenylacetaldehyde 3atemperature 2aAcetaldehydexanalogs & derivativesxchemistry. 2aBiogenic Aminesxchemistry 2aModels, Chemical 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aPhenethylaminesxchemistry 0aBiogenic amines 0acarbonyl−amine reactions 0alipid oxidation 0aMaillard reaction 0aStrecker aldehydes1 aDelgado, Rosa M.1 aHidalgo, Francisco J.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2012 May 30, v. 60, no. 21 p.5491-5496dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51187nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjf301258s3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03108naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005800139245015600197300001600353500001900369500002000388520129900408592002801707596003401735596004001769596002901809596001601838596003901854596001501893596001601908596003401924596002201958596001601980596005001996596003802046596003102084596002802115596001602143650001302159650001202172650002302184650001002207650001902217650001202236700004102248700002602289700001602315700002702331773012602358856007302484852000902557655001202566IND60739328020221121111750.0210527e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073932802DNAL7 a10.1111/aje.128532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBreuer, Thomas1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8387-571210aHigh abundance and large proportion of medium and large duikers in an intact and unhunted afrotropical protected area: Insights into monitoring methods  ap. 399-411.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aUnsustainable hunting of bushmeat has dramatic impacts on ecological processes and people's livelihoods. Unfortunately, there is often a strong controversy regarding the sustainability of duiker hunting due to their continued presence in bushmeat markets, on the one hand, and the predictions of sustainable harvest models for duiker abundance, on the other. This apparent contradiction is largely due to biased low abundance estimates from dung surveys. We present results from a 52.4 km line transect dung survey using site decay rates to estimate duiker densities. In addition, camera trapping (14,995 camera trap‐days) was used to provide detection rates and a baseline for the ratio of blue to red duikers as an index of hunting pressure from Nouabalé‐Ndoki National Park, with almost zero levels of hunting. Dung surveys revealed high overall duiker densities (totalling 107.4 duikers per km²) and quick dung decay rate. Camera trapping revealed high‐duiker detection rates and a high ratio of red to blue duikers. Pristine protected areas and no‐hunting zones continue to act as source habitats for high recruitment of harvested species. We discuss future options for monitoring duikers and applying the ratio of red to blue duikers as an index of the level of duiker hunting.  aPublisher supplied data  cThe Columbus Zoo and Aquarium  cCincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden  cCleveland Metroparks Zoo  cBrevard Zoo  cDisney Worldwide Conservation Fund  cDublin Zoo  cToronto Zoo  cWildlife Conservation Society  cWoodland Park Zoo  cHouston Zoo  cSea World and Busch Gardens Conservation Fund  cGordon and Betty Moore Foundation  cConservation International  cSmithsonian Institution  cCologne Zoo 3abushmeat 3acameras 3aconservation areas 3afeces 3anational parks 3asurveys1 aBreuer‐Ndoundou Hockemba, Mireille1 aOpepa, Cisquet Kiebou1 aYoga, Sarah1 aMavinga, Franck Barrel0 tAfrican journal of ecology.g2021 June, v. 59, no. 2 p.399-411dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl31087x0141-67077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/aje.128533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01319naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002900140245009900169300001800268520024200286592002800528650002700556650002100583650001300604700002200617700002000639700002100659700001900680700002400699700002400723700001900747773013200766856007400898852000900972655001200981IND60726245020221122095141.0210203e20210202xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072624502DNAL7 a10.1039/d0cc07776c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShivakumar, Kilingaru I.12aA hydrogen-bonded organic framework based on redox-active tri(dithiolylidene)cyclohexanetrione  ap. 1157-1160.  aRedox-active hexakis(4-carboxyphenyl) tri(dithiolylidene)cyclohexanetrione (CPDC) was synthesized.

Affimers are a novel class of affinity binders based on a structurally robust protease inhibitor scaffold (i.e., Cystatin A), which are selected by phage display and produced in a rapid and simple E. coli protein expression system. These binders have a defined amino acid sequence with defined binding regions and are versatile, thereby allowing for easy engineering. Here we present an affimer-based liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS) method for quantification of the soluble Receptor of Advanced Glycation End-products (sRAGE), a promising biomarker for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The method was validated according to European Medicines Agency and U.S. Food and Drug Administration guidelines and enabled quantitation of serum sRAGE between 0.2 and 10 ng/mL. Comparison between the affimer-based method and a previously developed, validated antibody-based method showed good correlation (R² = 0.88) and indicated that 25% lower sRAGE levels are reported by the affimer-based assay. In conclusion, we show the first-time application of affimers in a quantitative LC–MS method, which supports the potential of affimers as robust alternatives to antibodies.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEscherichia coli 3aFood and Drug Administration 3aadvanced glycation end products 3aamino acid sequences 3aantibodies 3abacteriophages 3abiomarkers 3abiomedical research 3ablood serum 3aengineering 3aguidelines 3ahumans 3aliquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3aprotein synthesis 3aproteinase inhibitors 3aproteome 3arespiratory tract diseases 0aaffimers 0abiomarker 0aCOPD 0aimmunoprecipitation 0aLC−MS 0aquantification1 aHadderingh, Marrit1 aHorvatovich, Péter1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2218-11401 aten Hacken, Nick H.

This balance is achieved in part through tightly regulated communication networks among growth and stress response signaling pathways. Understanding the communication modules between brassinosteroids (BRs), the ubiquitous hormones known to control growth and stress adaptation, and the general stress response (GSR), a rapid and transient transcriptional output in response to perturbations, provides an optimal platform to unravel new facet(s) of plant stress adaptation. Here, we explore communication facets of BR with GSR via in planta quantification of the GSR in Arabidopsis expressing luciferase driven by a functional GSR cis-element, the Rapid Stress Response Element (4xRSRE:LUC). We establish that application of exogenous BR suppresses microbe-associated molecular pattern-activated GSR, but enhances the wound-triggered GSR. The enhanced wound-activated GSR in BR-treated plants results in a greater wound-induced resistance to Botrytis cinerea. A combination of molecular genetics using BR signaling mutants and application of an activator of BR signaling, bikinin, confirms these results and places the chief point of BR-GSR interaction downstream of potential membrane receptor circuitry. These results support a multi-modular interaction between BRs and stress signaling, instrumental in customizing stimulus-specific responses in Arabidopsis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3aBotrytis cinerea 3abrassinosteroids 3aenvironmental factors 3ahormones 3aluciferase 3amembrane potential 3amutants 3aplant stress 3aresource allocation 3asignal transduction 3astress response 3atranscription (genetics) 0aABA 0aBAK1 0aBES 0aBIK 0aBIN2 0aBKI1 0aBL 0aBR 0aBRI1 0aBSK 0aBSU 0aBZR1 0aCCD 0aCDG 0aCrRLK1L 0aCOI1 0aDAMP 0aDMSO 0aERF1 0aflg22 0aGA 0aGSK3 0aGSR 0aIAA 0aJA 0aLUC 0aMAMP 0aMAPK 0aMeJA 0aOPDA 0aORA59 0aPEPR 0aPDF1.2 0aPR1 0aPRR 0aRAP2.12 0aROS 0aRSRE 0aSA 0aSAR 0aTF 0aUBQ 0aVSP2 0aWAK1 0aWIR 0aBrassinosteroid (BR) 0aCross-hormonal communication 0aGeneral stress response (GSR) 0aHypoxia 0aMicrobe-associated molecular pattern (MAMP) 0aWound-induced resistance1 aDandekar, Abhaya M.1 aChory, Joanne1 aDehesh, Katayoon1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9312-80320 tPlant science.g2016 Sept., v. 250 p.165-177dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl38764x0168-94527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plantsci.2016.06.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02697naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245010700156520175000263592002802013650001502041650002402056650001402080650001402094650002002108650001302128650003002141700001602171773012602187856007302313852000902386655001202395IND60651909320221119183320.0190712e20170313xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065190932DNAL7 a10.3390/su90304262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Joosung10aBIM-Based 4D Simulation to Improve Module Manufacturing Productivity for Sustainable Building Projects  aModular construction methods, where products are manufactured beforehand in a factory and then transported to the site for installation, are becoming increasingly popular for construction projects in many countries as this method facilitates the use of the advanced technologies that support sustainability in building projects. This approach requires dual factory–site process management to be carefully coordinated and the factory module manufacturing process must therefore be managed in a detailed and quantitative manner. However, currently, the limited algorithms available to support this process are based on mathematical methodologies that do not consider the complex mix of equipment, factories, personnel, and materials involved. This paper presents three new building information modeling-based 4D simulation frameworks to manage the three elements—process, quantity, and quality—that determine the productivity of factory module manufacturing. These frameworks leverage the advantages of 4D simulation and provide more precise information than existing conventional documents. By utilizing a 4D model that facilitates the visualization of a wide range of data variables, manufacturers can plan the module manufacturing process in detail and fully understand the material, equipment, and workflow needed to accomplish the manufacturing tasks. Managers can also access information about material quantities for each process and use this information for earned value management, warehousing/storage, fabrication, and assembly planning. By having a 4D view that connects 2D drawing models, manufacturing errors and rework can be minimized and problems such as construction delays, quality lapses, and cost overruns vastly reduced.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acomputer simulation 3aequipment 3afactories 3ahuman resources 3aplanning 3asustainable manufacturing1 aKim, Jaejun0 tSustainability.g2017 Mar. 13, v. 9, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su90304263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03550naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001700094024002100111024004100132024004400173024001100217040001800228100002400246245010300270300001400373506017300387520186000560650001102420650001302431650002302444650001402467650001802481650001502499650001402514650000902528700002502537700001702562700002402579700002302603773011602626856011202742856008702854956014502941961000903086852000903095655001203104IND60005934720221214225902.0140717e20141001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6000593472DNAL7 a3052692aris7 a10113/593472hdl7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2014.06.1212doi7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2014.06.1212chorus8 ans5018  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChambers, Katrin B.10aPotential bioactivity and association of 17β-estradiol with the dissolved and colloidal fractions  ap. 58-64.  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aThe dissolved (DF) and colloidal fractions (CF) of soil and manure play an important role in the environmental fate and transport of steroidal estrogens. The first objective of this study was to quantify the association of 17β-estradiol (E2) with the DF and CF isolated from (i) liquid swine manure (LSM), (ii) a soil:water mixture (soil), and (iii) a LSM:soil:water mixture (Soil + LSM). The appropriate CF and DF size fractions of the Soil, Soil+LSM, and LSM media were obtained by first filtering through a 0.45 Î¼m filter, which provided the combined DF and CF (DF/CF). The DF/CF from the three media was spiked with carbon-14 ([¹⁴C]) radiolabeled E2 ([¹⁴C]-E2), and then ultrafiltered to isolate the CF (b0.45 Î¼m and N1 kDa) from the DF (b1 kDa). The average recoveries of the [¹⁴C] associated with the DF were 67%-72%, 67%-79%, and 76%-78% for the Soil, Soil + LSM and LSM, respectively. For the CF that was retained on the 1 kDa filter, organic carbon and [¹⁴C]-E2 were dislodged with subsequent water rinses the Soil + LSM and LSM, but not the Soil. The second objective was to evaluate whether the E2 associated with the various fractions of the different media could still bind the estrogen receptor using an E2 receptor (17β-ER) competitor assay, which allowed E2 equivalent concentrations to be determined. The estrogen receptor assay results indicated that E2 present in the DF of the Soil and Soil + LSM solutions could still bind the estrogen receptor. Results from this study indicated that E2 preferentially associated with the DF of soil and manure, which may enhance its dissolved advective transport in surface and subsurface water. Furthermore, this study indicated that E2 associated with DF solutions in the environment could potentially induce endocrine responses through its interactions with estrogen receptor. 3acarbon 3acolloids 3aenvironmental fate 3aestradiol 3aliquid manure 3apig manure 3areceptors 3asoil1 aCasey, Francis X.

Comments to the proposed menu-labelling policy were extracted from Regulations.gov and analysed. A framing matrix was used to organize and code key devices and themes. Documents were analysed using content analysis with Dedoose software. Recent national nutrition-labelling regulations in the USA provide a timely opportunity to understand message framing in relation to obesity prevention and policy. We examined a total of ninety-seven documents submitted on behalf of organizations (private industry, n 64; public health, n 33). Public health focused on positive health consequences of the policy, used a social justice frame and supported its arguments with academic data. Industry was more critical of the policy; it used a market justice frame that emphasized minimal regulation, depicted its members as small, family-run businesses, and illustrated points with humanizing examples. Public health framing should counter and consider engaging directly with non-health-related arguments made by industry. Public health should include more powerful framing devices to convey their messages, including metaphors and humanizing examples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadvocacy 3acomputer software 3aissues and policy 3amarkets 3anutrition labeling 3aobesity 3aprivate sector 3apublic health 3asocial justice 3aUnited States 0aPolicy 0aMessage framing1 aColgrove, James1 aLee, Grace1 aTruong, Michelle1 aWingood, Gina M0 tPublic health nutrition.g2017 Apr., v. 20, no. 5 p.814-823dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl56775x1475-27277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S13689800160030253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02357naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245011400154300001800268520104800286592002801334650002201362650001801384650001101402650002101413650002201434650001901456650001301475650001401488650001101502650001901513650001401532650002101546650001301567700001201580700001701592700001801609700001601627700001701643700001801660700001701678773012101695856007401816852000901890655001201899IND60666868520221119032952.0190919e20141215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066686852DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra09388g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, He14aThe highest connected pure inorganic 3D framework assembled by {P₄Mo₆} cluster and alkali metal potassium  ap. 3552-3559.  aA 3D high connected pure inorganic framework based on {P₄Mo₆} cluster, [{K(H₂O)}₁₂{CoMo₁₂ⱽO₂₄(OH)₆(HPO₄)₄(PO₄)₄}] (1) has been hydrothermally synthesized and characterized by elemental analysis, IR, TG, UV analysis and single crystal X-ray diffraction analyses.

Yet for decades prior to the genomics era, viruses were largely overlooked in microbial ecology research, as only low-throughput culture-based methods of discovering viruses were available. With the advent of metagenomics, culture-independent techniques have provided exciting opportunities to discover and study new viruses. Here, we review recently developed computational methods for identifying viral sequences, exploring viral diversity in environmental samples, and predicting hosts from metagenomic sequence data. Methods to analyze viruses in silico utilize unconventional approaches to tackle challenges unique to viruses, such as vast diversity, mosaic viral genomes, and the lack of universal marker genes. As the field of viral ecology expands exponentially, computational advances have become increasingly important to gain insight into the role viruses in diverse habitats.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiotechnology 3acommunity structure 3acomputer simulation 3ametagenomics 3amicrobial communities 3aviral genome 0aBacteriophage-host 0aViral diversity 0aViral metagenomics 0aMicrobial ecology 0aBioinformatics1 aStrous, Marc1 aHawley, Alyse K.0 tComputational and Structural Biotechnology Journal.g2020, v. 18 p.1605-1612dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23199x2001-03707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.csbj.2020.06.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02632naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147242003800166245005800204300001400262520104900276592002801325650001701353650002801370650002501398650001801423650002801441650001101469650001301480650001501493650004301508650001801551650001501569650001801584650001301602650002201615651001101637653002601648653002401674653001101698653001701709653001701726653001801743653001801761653001101779653001601790653001501806653001701821773016201838856008102000852000902081655001202090IND60590430920200827000000.0180313e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059043092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cnd.2017.12.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChamp, Martine10aShould we eat more whole cereals?10aDevrions-nous manger plus de céréales complètes ?  ap. 22-33.  aWhole grains are sources of dietary fibre but also of vitamins, minerals and antioxidant compounds. Their consumption is associated to health benefits. They decrease type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and colorectal cancer. ANSES recommends an increase in the consumption of whole cereals which is very low in France; other countries have a recommendation such as 90g or three servings of whole grains per day. At the same time, ANSES recommends a dietary fibre intake of 30g per day that cannot be achieved without the consumption of whole grain products. Depending on how they are grown, it can be assumed that whole grains contain more contaminants (including pesticides and mycotoxins) than refined cereal products. The presence of these contaminants is strictly controlled and the levels reached in the foods analyzed do not exceed the Toxicological Reference Values for a vast majority of consumers. Most epidemiological studies demonstrate a positive benefit/risk ratio that confirms the value of consuming whole grains for health.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidants 3acardiovascular diseases 3acolorectal neoplasms 3adietary fiber 3aepidemiological studies 3agrains 3aminerals 3amycotoxins 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3anormal values 3apesticides 3arelative risk 3avitamins 3awhole grain foods 3aFrance 0aCéréales complètes 0aFibres alimentaires 0aSanté 0aConsommation 0aContaminants 0aWhole cereals 0aDietary fibre 0aHealth 0aConsumption 0aPesticides 0aContaminants0 tCahiers de nutrition et de diététique.g2018 Feb., v. 53 p.22-33dElsevier Masson SASaSociété française de nutritionwJournal:jnl17549x0007-99607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cnd.2017.12.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle
