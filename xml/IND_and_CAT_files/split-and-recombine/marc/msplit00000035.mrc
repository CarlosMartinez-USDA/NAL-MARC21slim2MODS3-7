Small and isolated populations face higher extinction risks, due to demographic and environmental stochasticity, and also because of several genetic threats, among which inbreeding is considered the most important one. For many of these species, the extinction of a population is an irreversible event, so that determining the immediate importance of these risk factors and understanding their interactions is crucial for conservation plans. Iberolacerta monticola is a small lacertid endemic to the northwestern Iberian Peninsula, distributed mainly across moderate/high altitude mountainous regions. Some populations are found nearly at sea-level, though, in fluvial valleys with relict Atlantic forests, in the severely fragmented western part of its range. One of them has been dramatically reduced over the last 30 years, and presently is on the brink of extinction. Using microsatellite nuclear markers, we obtained different measures of genetic variation at this site, together with demographic and breeding data. Both the level of heterozygosity and the number of alleles per locus indicate that the level of variation in this population is comparatively high, and the average inbreeding coefficient is very low. Individuals appear healthy and long-lived, and are related by a few different lines of descent. These findings are discussed in the context of current theories and experimental evidence of associative overdominance and purging of the genetic load of populations, with special emphasis on the evolutionary potential of recovery of small evolutionary units.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalleles 3aloci 3ainbreeding coefficient 3aoverdominance 3agenetic variation 3arisk factors 3aheterozygosity 3ainbreeding 3avalleys 3aextinction 3aaltitude 3apopulation size 3ahabitats 3aforests 3aIberian Peninsula 0arisk1 aGalán, Pedro,1 aNaveira, Horacio0 tConservation genetics.g2012 Feb., v. 13, no. 1 p.131-142dSpringer-Verlagx1566-06217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10592-011-0272-3  aDNAL 7aarticle03555naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006100150245013300211300001800344520228000362592002802642650002502670650001902695650001502714650004602729650001802775650001702793650002602810650001402836700001502850700002302865700002002888700006202908773012902970856008503099852000903184655001203193IND60771927020221121172409.0220330e20220314xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077192702DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.1c055852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIvanov, Daniil G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2987-104810aRapid Evaluation of the Extent of Haptoglobin Glycosylation Using Orthogonal Intact-Mass MS Approaches and Multivariate Analysis  ap. 5140-5148.  aIntact-mass measurements are becoming increasingly popular in mass spectrometry (MS) based protein characterization, as they allow the entire complement of proteoforms to be evaluated within a relatively short time. However, applications of this approach are currently limited to systems exhibiting relatively modest degrees of structural diversity, as the high extent of heterogeneity frequently prevents straightforward MS measurements. Incorporation of limited charge reduction into electrospray ionization (ESI) MS is an elegant way to obtain meaningful information on most heterogeneous systems, yielding not only the average mass of the protein but also the mass range populated by the entire complement of proteoforms. Application of this approach to characterization of two different phenotypes of haptoglobin (1-1 and 2-1) provides evidence of a significant difference in their extent of glycosylation (with the glycan load of phenotype 2-1 being notably lighter) despite a significant overlap of their ionic signals. More detailed characterization of their glycosylation patterns is enabled by the recently introduced technique of cross-path reactive chromatography (XP-RC) with online MS detection, which combines chromatographic separation with in-line reduction of disulfide bonds to generate metastable haptoglobin subunits. Application of XP-RC to both haptoglobin phenotypes confirms that no modifications are present within their light chains and provides a wealth of information on glycosylation patterns of the heavy chains. N-Glycosylation patterns of both haptoglobin phenotypes were found to be consistent with bi- and triantennary structures of complex type that exhibit significant level of fucosylation and sialylation. However, multivariate analysis of haptoglobin 1-1 reveals higher number of the triantennary structures, in comparison to haptoglobin 2-1, as well as a higher extent of fucosylation. The glycosylation patterns deduced from the XP-RC/MS measurements are in agreement with the conclusions of the intact-mass analysis supplemented by limited charge reduction, suggesting that the latter technique can be employed in situations when fast assessment of protein heterogeneity is needed (e.g., process analytical technology applications).  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical chemistry 3achromatography 3adisulfides 3aelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry 3aglycosylation 3ahaptoglobins 3amultivariate analysis 3aphenotype1 aYang, Yang1 aPawlowski, Jake W.1 aCarrick, Ian J.1 aKaltashov, Igor A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4355-60390 tAnalytical chemistry.g2022 Mar. 14, v. 94, no. 12 p.5140-5148dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.1c055853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02881naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100006000144245010900204300001800313520155500331592002801886650001101914650002301925650001401948650001201962650001601974653003801990653002602028653002602054653003302080653002202113653003102135700001902166700002002185700006402205773013902269856007802408852000902486655001202495IND60680951520200401000000.0200110e20191206xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068095152DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.9b138022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMukherjee, Samik1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5279-111010a3D Atomic Mapping of Interfacial Roughness and Its Spatial Correlation Length in Sub-10 nm Superlattices  ap. 1728-1736.  aThe interfacial abruptness and uniformity in heterostructures are critical to control their electronic and optical properties. With this perspective, this work demonstrates the three-dimensional (3D) atomic-level mapping of the roughness and uniformity of buried epitaxial interfaces in Si/SiGe superlattices with a layer thickness in the 1.5–7.5 nm range. Herein, 3D atom-by-atom maps were acquired and processed to generate isoconcentration surfaces highlighting local fluctuations in content at each interface. These generated surfaces were subsequently utilized to map the interfacial roughness and its spatial correlation length. The analysis revealed that the root-mean-squared roughness of the buried interfaces in the investigated superlattices is sensitive to the growth temperature with a value varying from 0.17 ± 0.02 to 0.26 ± 0.03 nm in the temperature range of 500–650 °C. The estimated horizontal correlation lengths were found to be 8.11 ± 0.5 nm at 650 °C and 10.09 ± 0.6 nm at 500 °C. Additionally, reducing the growth temperature was found to improve the interfacial abruptness, with a 30% smaller interfacial width is obtained at 500 °C. This behavior is attributed to the thermally activated atomic exchange at the surface during the heteroepitaxy. Finally, by testing different optical models with increasing levels of interfacial complexity, it is demonstrated that the observed atomic-level roughening at the interface must be accounted for to accurately describe the optical response of Si/SiGe heterostructures.  aPublisher supplied data 3amodels 3aoptical properties 3aroughness 3asilicon 3atemperature 0asilicon−germanium superlattices 0aatom probe tomography 0ainterfacial roughness 0ainterface correlation length 0ainterfacial width 0aspectroscopic ellipsometry1 aAttiaoui, Anis1 aBauer, Matthias1 aMoutanabbir, Oussama1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0721-36960 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2019 Dec. 06, v. 12, no. 1 p.1728-1736dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b138023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02245naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245010400155300002000259520104500279592002801324650002201352650003101374650003601405650001701441650001801458650001801476650002401494650002201518650002201540700001501562700001901577700001601596700001801612700002001630773012501650856007501775852000901850655001201859IND60775753520221122101235.0220428e20220411xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077575352DNAL7 a10.1039/d2ra01684b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Zhi-li10aNew ent-kaurane diterpenoid acids from Nouelia insignis Franch and their anti-inflammatory activity  ap. 11155-11163.  aEleven undescribed ent-kaurane-type diterpenoid acids, namely noueinsiancins A–K (1–11), together with sixteen related known analogs (12–27) were isolated from Nouelia insignis Franch. The chemical structures and absolute configurations of the new compounds were confirmed by the extensive spectroscopic data, electronic circular dichroism (ECD) data analysis and single crystal X-ray diffraction. Additionally, the anti-inflammatory assay was applied to estimate the nitric oxide (NO) inhibitory activities of all compounds by using lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced RAW 264.7 cells in vitro. The results revealed that 4–7 and 13–17 significantly inhibited NO production at the concentrations of 2.5 μM, 5.0 μM and 10.0 μM. Meanwhile, compounds 6 and 7 were found to down-regulate the protein expression levels of IL-6 and TNF-α in RAW 264.7 cells induced by LPS in a dose-dependent manner. In conclusion, these findings provided the reference values for exploring the new chemicals with biological activities from this genus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3acircular dichroism spectroscopy 3aditerpenoids 3adose response 3ainterleukin-6 3alipopolysaccharides 3aprotein synthesis 3aspectral analysis1 aLi, Jia-yu1 aHuang, Peng-li1 aSun, Ze-shi1 aLi, Hui-liang1 aZhang, Wei-dong0 tRSC advances.g2022 Apr. 11, v. 12, no. 18 p.11155-11163dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d2ra01684b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02140naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001800137245014900155300001700304500002000321520104600341592002801387650001901415650001201434650001701446650001301463650001401476650002201490650001501512650002401527651001201551651001101563700002101574773010201595856007201697852000901769655001201778IND60787234120221120144421.0220808e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078723412DNAL7 a10.12705/675.102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTroia, Angelo10aClarifying the nomenclature of some Euro‐Mediterranean quillworts (Isoetes, Isoetaceae): Indicator species and species of conservation concern  ap. 996-1004.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aTo stabilize the application of some names in the genus Isoetes in the Mediterranean biodiversity hotspot, we studied herbarium specimens and imaged spores with scanning electron microscopy, with special reference to those taxa in the I. lon‐gissima and I. histrix groups that were described from France, Algeria and Turkey, and are in need of a taxonomic revision. The following names are lectotypified: I. adspersa, I. boryana, I. delalandei, and I. viollaei. Holotypes of I. perralderiana and I. olympica were ascertained. We conclude that I. boryana (listed in the “Bern Convention” and in the European Union “Habitats” Directive) justifies consideration at species rank, but I. adspersa should be synonymized with I. longissima. Isoetes tenuissima and I. perralderiana are proposed as distinct species pending further studies. In the I. histrix group, we tentatively accept I. delalandei as a species, presenting some observations on “I. histrix f. subinermis” nom. nud.

Therapeutic strategy based on gut‐liver axis and probiotics is a promising approach for the treatment of NAFLD. However, rare probiotics have been applied in NAFLD treatment, and the involved molecular mechanism is not entirely clear. RESULTS: We initially identified a novel functional probiotic, Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens ZW3, on the lipid deposition by a simple and rapid zebrafish model. Supplementation with ZW3 to the methionine and choline deficient (MCD) diet induced NAFLD rats could improve the liver impairments and reduce inflammation through TLR4‐MyD88 and JNK signaling pathways. Moreover, ZW3 modulated gut microbiota by promoting relative abundance of Firmicutes and Lactobacillus, decreasing the abundance of Escherichia‐Shigella and Bacteroides. Functional prediction of microbiome showed ZW3 presented potential enhancement on carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, cell process control and signal transduction processes, and reduced several human diseases. CONCLUSION: This present study identified a novel probiotic and its protective effects on NAFLD, and interpreted the interactions of ZW3 with the immune system and gut microbiota involved in gut‐liver axis. © 2022 Society of Chemical Industry.  aPublisher supplied data  a2020M680895cChina Postdoctoral Science Foundation  a31801514cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aBacteroides 3aDanio rerio 3aLactobacillus 3aagriculture 3acarbohydrates 3acholine 3adiet 3afatty liver 3ahumans 3aimmune system 3ainflammation 3aintestinal microorganisms 3alipid metabolism 3alipids 3aliver 3amethionine 3amicrobial communities 3amicrobiome 3amodels 3aprediction 3aprobiotics 3aprocess control 3asignal transduction 3atherapeutics1 aZhang, Yang1 aYang, Jingnan1 aZhang, Jing1 aZhao, Jingqi1 aWang, Jinju1 aJia, Longgang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3400-55311 aWang, Yanping0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2022 Aug. 30, v. 102, no. 11 p.4620-4628dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.wJournal:jnl48536x0022-51427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.118203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01805naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245015200171300001600323520078300339592002801122650002501150650001601175650001201191650002001203650001501223651001501238700001901253700001701272700001501289773008001304856008601384852000901470655001201479IND60085013820221116200405.0141101e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008501382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2013.03.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCanizes, Bruno10aMixed integer non-linear programming and Artificial Neural Network based approach to ancillary services dispatch in competitive electricity markets  ap. 261-270.  aAncillary services represent a good business opportunity that must be considered by market players.

Two test cases based on California Independent System Operator data concerning dispatch of Regulation Down, Regulation Up, Spin Reserve and Non-Spin Reserve services are included in this paper to illustrate the application of the proposed method: (1) dispatch considering simple bids; (2) dispatch considering complex bids.  aPublisher supplied data 3abusiness enterprises 3aelectricity 3amarkets 3aneural networks 3aprediction 3aCalifornia1 aSoares, João,1 aFaria, Pedro1 aVale, Zita0 tApplied energy.g2013 Aug., v. 108 p.261-270dElsevier Ltdx0306-26197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2013.03.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02174naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245009400172300001600266500001900282520106200301592002801363650001401391650001901405650002401424650001501448650001101463650001301474650001001487650001801497651001501515700002301530700002201553700002301575773011201598856008101710852000901791655001201800IND60711012420221121103551.0200915e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071101242DNAL7 a10.1134/S009780782005019X2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSanim Bissenbayeva, 10aCharacteristics and Causes of Changes in Water Quality in the Syr Darya River, Kazakhstan  ap. 904-912.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe water quality parameters, like major ions, have been monitored at three stations located along the Syr Darya River. The trend analysis was performed on annual timescales using the Mann–Kendall test, the Sen’s slope estimator and the linear regression. The relationships of the water quality parameters to river discharge were also investigated. The statistical methods showed both positive and negative trends in annual water quality data and major ions. Significant trends were detected by the statistical methods in sulphate, sodium-potassium ion and chloride ion series. Before 1940 the mineralization of water was 0.4–0.6 g/L and the water was bicarbonate-calcium, with an increased sulfate ions volume. Atthe moment, the mineralization index has become three times higher. The mineralization varies from 0.9–1.2 g/L in the upper and 1.5–2.0 g/L in the lower reaches of the river. The sulfate ion and sodium-potassium ions began to predominate, dangerously exceeded volumes of the chloride ion in the lower part of the river are observed.  aPublisher supplied data 3achlorides 3amineralization 3aregression analysis 3ariver flow 3arivers 3asulfates 3awater 3awater quality 3aKazakhstan1 aAbuduwaili, Jilili1 aIssanova, Gulnura1 aSamarkhanov, Kanat0 tWater resources.g2020 Sept., v. 47, no. 5 p.904-912dPleiades PublishingwJournal:jnl7406x0097-80787nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S009780782005019X3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03526naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245009200171300001600263520167700279592002801956650001401984650001201998650002502010650001702035650001502052650002502067650001402092650002202106650001102128650001902139650002402158650001502182650002702197650001102224650002502235650002602260650002202286650000702308650002102315650001902336650001202355650001302367650002702380650001402407650002902421650001902450650001302469653003402482653002902516653001902545653001502564653003402579700002102613700001602634700001902650773012602669856008402795852000902879655001202888IND60121738020221123011119.0150324e20140902xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012173802DNAL7 a10.1080/15226514.2013.8105742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMudumbi, J. B.N.10aSusceptibility of Riparian Wetland Plants to Perfluorooctanoic Acid (PFOA) Accumulation  ap. 926-936.  aAs plants have been shown to accumulate organic compounds from contaminated sediments, there is a potential for long-lasting ecological impact as a result of contaminant accumulation in riparian areas of wetlands, particularly the accumulation of non-biodegradable contaminants such as perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA). In this study, commonly found riparian wetland plants including reeds, i.e., Xanthium strumarium, Phragmites australis, Schoenoplectus corymbosus, Ruppia maritime; Populus canescens, Polygonum salicifolium, Cyperus congestus; Persicaria amphibian, Ficus carica, Artemisia schmidtiana, Eichhornia crassipes , were studied to determine their susceptibility to PFOA accumulation from PFOA contaminated riparian sediment with a known PFOA concentration, using liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS). The bioconcentration factor (BCF) indicated that the plants affinity to PFOA accumulation was; E. crassipes , > P. salicifolium , > C. congestus , > P. x canescens , > P. amphibian , > F. carica , > A. schmidtiana , > X. strumarium , > P. australis , > R. maritime , > S. corymbosus . The concentration of PFOA in the plants and/or reeds was in the range 11.7 to 38 ng/g, with a BCF range of 0.05 to 0.37. The highest BCF was observed in sediment for which its core water had a high salinity, total organic carbon and a pH which was near neutral. As the studied plants had a higher affinity for PFOA, the resultant effect is that riparian plants such as E. crassipes , X. strumarium , and P. salicifolium , typified by a fibrous rooting system, which grow closer to the water edge, exacerbate the accumulation of PFOA in riparian wetlands.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArtemisia 3aCyperus 3aEichhornia crassipes 3aFicus carica 3aPersicaria 3aPhragmites australis 3aPolygonum 3aPopulus canescens 3aRuppia 3aSchoenoplectus 3aXanthium strumarium 3aamphibians 3abioaccumulation factor 3acarbon 3aenvironmental impact 3aliquid chromatography 3aorganic compounds 3apH 3aphytoremediation 3ariparian areas 3arooting 3asalinity 3asediment contamination 3asediments 3atandem mass spectrometry 3awetland plants 3awetlands 0aPerfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) 0aperfluorinated compounds 0awetland plants 0areed grass 0abioconcentration factor (BCF)1 aNtwampe, S.

Nevertheless, the stochastic nature of wind poses a great challenge when attempting to find an accurate forecasting model for wind power. Therefore, precise wind power forecasts are of primary importance to solve operational, planning and economic problems in the growing wind power scenario. Previous research has focused efforts on the deterministic forecast of wind power values, but less attention has been paid to providing information about wind energy. Based on an optimal Adaptive-Network-Based Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) and Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA), this paper develops a hybrid uncertainty forecasting model, IFASF (Interval Forecast-ANFIS-SSA-Firefly Alogorithm), to obtain the upper and lower bounds of daily average wind power, which is beneficial for the practical operation of both the grid company and independent power producers. To strengthen the practical ability of this developed model, this paper presents a comparison between IFASF and other benchmarks, which provides a general reference for this aspect for statistical or artificially intelligent interval forecast methods. The comparison results show that the developed model outperforms eight benchmarks and has a satisfactory forecasting effectiveness in three different wind farms with two time horizons.  aPublisher supplied data 3amodels 3aplanning 3auncertainty 3awind 3awind farms 3awind power1 aSong, Yiliao1 aLiu, Feng1 aLiu, Jinpeng0 tSustainability.g2016 Jan. 29, v. 8, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su80201253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03026naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245012500172300001600297520136100313592002801674650000801702650002201710650000801732650002101740650002801761650002301789650001301812650002001825650001501845650001001860650001701870650002101887650001501908650001901923650003001942650002601972650001201998650002202010653002102032653002202053653000802075653000902083653002202092700002202114700002402136700002202160700001902182700002102201700001902222773012602241856008402367852000902451655001202460IND60121738120221123011615.0150324e20140902xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012173812DNAL7 a10.1080/15226514.2013.8105752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aViktorová, Jitka10aCharacterization of Transgenic Tobacco Plants Containing Bacterial bphc Gene and Study of Their Phytoremediation Ability  ap. 937-946.  aGenetically modified plants can serve as an efficient tool for remediation of diverse dangerous pollutants of the environment such as pesticides, heavy metals, explosives and persistent organic compounds. Transgenic lines of Nicotiana tabacum containing bacterial bphC gene from the degradation pathway of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were tested. The product of the bphC gene – enzyme 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl-1,2-dioxygenase is responsible for cleaving of the biphenyl ring. The presence of bphC gene in transgenic plants was detected on DNA, RNA and protein level. The expression of the bphC /His gene was verified after purification of the enzyme from plants by affinity chromatography followed by a Western blot and immunochemical assay. The enzyme activity of isolated protein was detected.Efficient transformation of 2,3-DHB by transgenic plants was achieved and the lines also exhibited high production of biomass. The transgenic plants were more tolerant to the commercial PCBs mixture Delor 103 than non-transgenic tobacco. And finally, the higher decrease of total PCB content and especially congener 28 in real contaminated soil from a dumpsite was determined after cultivation of transgenic plant in comparison with non-transgenic tobacco. The substrate specificity of transgenic plants was the same as substrate specificity of BphC enzyme.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aNicotiana tabacum 3aRNA 3aWestern blotting 3aaffinity chromatography 3abiomass production 3abiphenyl 3aenzyme activity 3aexplosives 3agenes 3aheavy metals 3aphytoremediation 3apollutants 3apolluted soils 3apolychlorinated biphenyls 3asubstrate specificity 3atobacco 3atransgenic plants 0aphytoremediation 0atransgenic plants 0aPCB 0abphC 0aNicotiana tabacum1 aNovakova, Martina1 aTrbolova, Ladislava1 aVrchotova, Blanka1 aLovecka, Petra1 aMackova, Martina1 aMacek, Thomas,0 tInternational journal of phytoremediation.g2014 Sept. 2, v. 16, no. 9 p.937-946dTaylor & Francis Groupx1549-78797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15226514.2013.8105753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02577naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245010500163520130900268592002801577650001201605650003001617650001601647650002001663650001201683650001201695650001401707650001601721650003101737650002001768650001101788650001401799650001401813650001701827650001801844650002001862650001701882650001301899700002301912773012601935856007302061852000902134655001202143IND60651769920221119231901.0190712e20160129xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065176992DNAL7 a10.3390/su80201312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeenik, Jonathan L.14aThe Potential Benefits and Limitations of Corn Cob and Sewage Sludge Biochars in an Infertile Oxisol  aThe thermal conversion of sewage sludge to biochar offers a promising alternative use for a hazardous waste material with potential benefits to agricultural productivity and soil quality. Three short-term greenhouse experiments were conducted to evaluate the effect of corn cob (CC) and sewage sludge (SS) biochars, with their anaerobically treated counterparts, on soil properties and plant growth in an infertile Oxisol. The anaerobically treated SS biochar showed the greatest concentration of bioavailable essential nutrients, but treatment only resulted in increased yields for the SS biochar in the first crop in the absence of added fertilizer. Both CC and SS biochars in combination with fertilizer doubled plant growth compared to the control in the first crop cycle, produced no significant effect in the second cycle, and more than tripled plant growth for the SS biochars in the third cycle. High ash content with high nutrient contributions (especially P) and a persistent liming effect explain the benefits of the SS biochars to plant growth. The SS biochar showed promise in mitigating the negative effects of soil Mn toxicity. Sewage sludge biochars reduced Cd bioavailability and had no significant effect on the bioavailability of other potentially toxic metals compared to the control.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOxisols 3aagricultural productivity 3aash content 3abioavailability 3abiochar 3acadmium 3acorn cobs 3afertilizers 3agreenhouse experimentation 3ahazardous waste 3aliming 3amanganese 3anutrients 3aplant growth 3asewage sludge 3asoil properties 3asoil quality 3atoxicity1 aCooney, Michael J.0 tSustainability.g2016 Jan. 29, v. 8, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su80201313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03344naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245014600165300001600311520151500327592002801842650002001870650001401890650002401904650001401928650001601942650001101958650002301969650001101992650002102003650001802024650003402042650001402076650001202090650001302102650000902115650002002124650001202144650001902156653000902175653000802184653001302192653001102205653000802216653000902224653001302233653003202246653002402278653002602302653002102328700001502349700001302364700001602377700001202393700001502405700001602420700001602436700001602452700001602468773009502484856008202579852000902661655001202670IND60611931020221121004918.0190326e20181201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061193102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tox.2018.08.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Jingwen10aERK1/2-mediated disruption of BDNF–TrkB signaling causes synaptic impairment contributing to fluoride–induced developmental neurotoxicity  ap. 222-230.  aExcessive exposure to fluoride has adverse effects on neurodevelopment, but the mechanisms remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate the effects of fluoride exposure on synaptogenesis, and focused on the role of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-tyrosine kinase B (TrkB) signaling in these effects. Using Sprague-Dawley rats developmentally exposed to sodium fluoride (NaF) from pregnancy until 6 months of delivery as in vivo model, we showed that fluoride impaired the cognitive abilities of offspring rats, decreased the density of dendritic spines and the expression of synapse proteins synaptophysin (SYN) and postsynaptic density protein-95 (PSD-95) in hippocampus, suggesting fluoride-induced cognitive deficit associates with synaptic impairment. Consistently, NaF treatment reduced dendritic outgrowth and expression of SYN and PSD-95 in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. Further studies demonstrated that the BDNF-TrkB axis was disrupted in vivo and in vitro, as manifested by BDNF accumulation and TrkB reduction. Importantly, fluoride treatment increased phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (p-ERK1/2) expression, while inhibition of p-ERK1/2 significantly attenuated the effects of NaF, indicating a regulating role of p-ERK1/2 in BDNF-TrkB signaling disruption. Collectively, these data suggest that the developmental neurotoxicity of fluoride is associated with the impairment of synaptogenesis, which is caused by ERK1/2-mediated BDNF-TrkB signaling disruption.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3acognition 3acognitive disorders 3adendrites 3ahippocampus 3ahumans 3alaboratory animals 3amodels 3aneurodevelopment 3aneurotoxicity 3aphosphotransferases (kinases) 3apregnancy 3aprogeny 3aproteins 3arats 3asodium fluoride 3asynapse 3asynaptogenesis 0aBDNF 0aNaF 0ap-ERK1/2 0aPSD-95 0aSYN 0aTrkB 0aFluoride 0aDevelopmental neurotoxicity 0aSynaptic impairment 0aBDNF–TrkB signaling 0aPhospho–ERK1/21 aNiu, Qiang1 aXia, Tao1 aZhou, Guoyu1 aLi, Pei1 aZhao, Qian1 aXu, Chunyan1 aDong, Lixin1 aZhang, Shun1 aWang, Aiguo0 tToxicology.g2018 Dec. 01, v. 410 p.222-230dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11858x0300-483X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tox.2018.08.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02124naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245012800169300001600297520116800313592002801481653001801509653001101527653002401538653002201562700002501584700002301609773010901632856008401741852000901825655001201834IND60127323720221116205047.0151110e200812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012732372DNAL7 a10.1653/0015-4040-91.4.6572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHastings, Jon M.10aBody size relationship between Sphecius speciosus (Hymenoptera: Crabronidae) and their prey: Prey size determines wasp size  ap. 657-663.  aEastern cicada killers, Sphecius speciosus Drury, are large, ground-nesting, mass-provisioning wasps that use cicadas to feed their offspring. Previous studies have reported that female S. speciosus provide each male offspring with 1 or rarely 2 cicadas, and each female offspring with 2 or rarely 3 cicadas, regardless of cicada size. We collected samples of male and female cicada killers and samples of their cicada prey from 12 locations in 10 different states of the USA. We measured right forewing length of the wasps and dry body mass of the cicadas as indicators of size; ANOVA revealed significant differences in mean masses among local populations of cicadas. We predicted that wasp size would also vary among locations, and would be positively correlated with mean size of local cicada prey. ANOVA did reveal significant differences in mean wing length in both male and female wasps among study sites. Regression analysis, with local mean cicada mass as the independent variable and local mean wasp wing length as the dependent variable, suggests that the size of available cicada prey is a good predictor of size for both male and female S. speciosus.  aPublisher supplied data 0acicada killer 0acicada 0abody size variation 0amass-provisioning1 aHolliday, Charles W.1 aCoelho,  Joseph R.0 tFlorida entomologist.g2008 Dec., v. 91, no. 4 p.657-663dFlorida Entomological Societyx0015-40407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1653%2F0015-4040-91.4.6573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03437naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002200188245006500210300001600275506007600291520171900367592002802086506003702114650002502151650001902176650003002195650001702225650002102242650001902263650002102282650001402303650002202317650001102339650001102350650001802361650003102379650002102410650001502431650000902446650001702455650001202472650001502484653001402499653002902513653001602542653002102558653002302579653001102602700005902613773009602672856008202768852000902850655001202859IND60611931220221207091125.0181002e20180901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061193122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tox.2018.08.0112doi7 aPMC68397622pmcid7 a301444652pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNaughton, Sean X.10aNeurotoxicity in acute and repeated organophosphate exposure  ap. 101-112.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe term organophosphate (OP) refers to a diverse group of chemicals that are found in hundreds of products worldwide. As pesticides, their most common use, OPs are clearly beneficial for agricultural productivity and the control of deadly vector-borne illnesses. However, as a consequence of their widespread use, OPs are now among the most common synthetic chemicals detected in the environment as well as in animal and human tissues. This is an increasing environmental concern because many OPs are highly toxic and both accidental and intentional exposures to OPs resulting in deleterious health effects have been documented for decades. Some of these deleterious health effects include a variety of long-term neurological and psychiatric disturbances including impairments in attention, memory, and other domains of cognition. Moreover, some chronic illnesses that manifest these symptoms such as Gulf War Illness and Aerotoxic Syndrome have (at least in part) been attributed to OP exposure. In addition to acute acetylcholinesterase inhibition, OPs may affect a number of additional targets that lead to oxidative stress, axonal transport deficits, neuroinflammation, and autoimmunity. Some of these targets could be exploited for therapeutic purposes. The purpose of this review is thus to: 1) describe the important uses of organophosphate (OP)-based compounds worldwide, 2) provide an overview of the various risks and toxicology associated with OP exposure, particularly long-term neurologic and psychiatric symptoms, 3) discuss mechanisms of OP toxicity beyond cholinesterase inhibition, 4) review potential therapeutic strategies to reverse the acute toxicity and long term deleterious effects of OPs.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aacetylcholinesterase 3aacute toxicity 3aagricultural productivity 3aautoimmunity 3aaxonal transport 3acholinesterase 3achronic diseases 3acognition 3aenzyme inhibition 3ahumans 3amemory 3aneurotoxicity 3aorganophosphorus compounds 3aoxidative stress 3apesticides 3arisk 3atherapeutics 3atissues 3atoxicology 0aPesticide 0aCholinesterase inhibitor 0aAgriculture 0aGulf war illness 0aAerotoxic syndrome 0aMemory1 aTerry, Alvin V.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2071-47670 tToxicology.g2018 Sept. 01, v. 408 p.101-112dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11858x0300-483X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tox.2018.08.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03583naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245011600165300001600281520207800297592002802375650001502403650001802418650001202436650002002448650001102468650001002479650001502489650001402504650001602518650001902534650001302553650002502566650001102591650001002602650001502612653002002627653002102647653002002668653003702688653001502725653002202740653001102762700002302773700002402796700002202820700002102842773010002863856008102963852000903044655001203053IND60545069920221116165644.0160901e20150901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054506992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rse.2015.06.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGriebel, Anne10aReliability and limitations of a novel terrestrial laser scanner for daily monitoring of forest canopy dynamics  ap. 205-213.  aLeaf area index (LAI) or plant area index (PAI) are commonly used to represent canopy structure and dynamics, but daily estimation of these variables using traditional ground-based methods is impractical and prone to multiple errors during data acquisition and processing. Existing terrestrial laser scanners can provide accurate representation of forest canopy structure, but the sensors are expensive, data processing is complex, and measurements are typically confined to a single event, which severely limits their utility in the interpretation of canopy trends indicated by remotely sensed data. We tested a novel, low-cost terrestrial laser scanner for its capacity to provide reliable and successive assessments of canopy PAI in an evergreen eucalypt forest. Daily scans comprised of 920 range measurements were made by three scanners at one forest site over a two-year period, providing mostly consecutive estimates of PAI, and of vertical structure profiles (as Plant Area Volume Density, PAVD). Data filtering, involving objective statistical methods to identify outliers, indicated that scan quality was adversely affected by moist weather and moderate wind speeds (>4ms−1), suggesting limited utility in some forest environments. Data cleaning (associated with sensor malfunctions) plus filtering removed 32 to 49% of scans, leaving on average 57% of data over the two-year period. Nonetheless, we found strong agreement between lidar-derived PAI estimates, and those from monthly hemispherical images (±0.1 PAI); with both methods indicating mostly stable PAI over multiple seasons. The PAVD profiles from the laser scanner indicated that leaf flush in the upper canopy concomitantly balanced leaf loss from the middle canopy in summer, which was consistent with measured summer peaks in litter fall. This clearly illustrated the advantages of three-dimensional lidar data over traditional two-dimensional PAI estimates in monitoring tree phenology, and in interpreting changes in canopy reflectance as detected by air- and space-borne remotely sensed data.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEucalyptus 3aforest canopy 3aforests 3aleaf area index 3aleaves 3alidar 3amonitoring 3aphenology 3areflectance 3aremote sensing 3ascanners 3astatistical analysis 3asummer 3atrees 3awind speed 0aCanopy dynamics 0aForest structure 0aLeaf Area Index 0aPlant Area Volume Density (PAVD) 0aMonitoring 0aTerrestrial lidar 0aVEGNET1 aBennett, Lauren T.1 aCulvenor, Darius S.1 aNewnham, Glenn J.1 aArndt, Stefan K.0 tRemote sensing of environment.g2015 Sept. 01, v. 166 p.205-213dElsevier Inc.x0034-42577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2015.06.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02070naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245018700166300001600353500001900369520091000388592002801298650001101326650001701337650002001354650003001374650001501404650001101419700002501430700002401455700002001479700001901499773011201518856008101630852000901711655001201720IND60711012920221121103542.0200915e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071101292DNAL7 a10.1134/S00978078200501152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKozlova, M.

Fuel property, gas emissions and furnace efficiency are compared. In regard to fuel properties, proximate analysis, ultimate analysis and heating values are determined and emissions of carbon monoxide (CO), nitric oxide (NO), nitrogen dioxide (NO₂), nitrogen oxides (NOx) and sulfur dioxide (SO₂) are measured and compared. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used for ash analysis. No ash agglomeration was observed and ash discharge was in the form of powder instead of lumped particles, which are usually observed for high ash biomass fuel. The results suggest that grass pellets can successfully be combusted with similar performance and emissions to that of other wood pellets if burned in appropriate combustion installations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aash content 3abiofuels 3abiomass 3aburning 3acarbon monoxide 3acombustion 3agas emissions 3agrasses 3aheat 3anitric oxide 3anitrogen dioxide 3apellets 3aproximate composition 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asulfur dioxide 3awood1 aDutta, Animesh1 aCorscadden, Kenny0 tApplied energy.g2013 Aug., v. 108 p.298-307dElsevier Ltdx0306-26197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2013.03.0443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03269naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006000151245010900211300001400320520175900334592002802093650001602121650002002137650001202157650001002169650001902179650001602198650002102214650001202235651001102247651001202258653001802270653002402288653001002312653001802322653001102340653001602351653001602367653002002383653001102403653001602414700001902430700002402449700005802473773014902531856008602680852000902766655001202775IND60644823220221116173327.0190712e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064482322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anbehav.2019.05.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFaraut, Lauriane1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5719-701410aHow life in a tolerant society affects the usage of grunts: evidence from female and male Guinea baboons  ap. 83-93.  aSignals are used to regulate interactions between individuals. To disentangle how motivational disposition, the processing of social information, and the costs and benefits of putative outcomes of interactions affect signalling behaviour, we investigated the usage and function of grunts during approaches in wild Guinea baboons, Papio papio. Guinea baboons live in a tolerant multilevel society with female-biased dispersal, which allowed us to compare their grunt usage to that of other more despotic baboon species. We analysed approaches by female and male Guinea baboons living in the Niokolo Koba National Park, Senegal. When approaching baboons grunted, they were more likely to interact in an affiliative fashion and less likely to displace the partner. In females, the probability of grunting was higher when the relationship strength was low, but only when an infant was present. In males, relationship strength had no impact on the likelihood of grunting during approaches. Rank did not explain variation in grunt probability in females and could not be discerned in males, but males were also more likely to grunt when an infant was near a female partner. We suggest that grunt usage in baboons can be best conceived as a combination of a motivational and a strategic component. The motivational component expresses the increased disposition to interact in an affiliative fashion, while the strategic component refers to the modulation of grunt usage with regard to relationship quality and context. The motivational component appears to be shared between baboon species, while variation in despotism and social organization places different premiums on the benefits of signalling, resulting in variation in grunting patterns between species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPapio papio 3aanimal behavior 3afemales 3amales 3anational parks 3aprobability 3asocial structure 3asociety 3aGuinea 3aSenegal 0aCommunication 0adominance hierarchy 0agrunt 0aGuinea baboon 0ainfant 0ainteraction 0aPapio papio 0asex combination 0asignal 0asocial bond1 aSiviter, Harry1 aPesco, Federica Dal1 aFischer, Julia1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5807-00740 tAnimal behaviour.g2019 July, v. 153 p.83-93dElsevier LtdaThe Association for the Study of Animal BehaviourwJournal:jnl45841x0003-34727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2019.05.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04541naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001800144245010500162300001800267520271300285592002802998650002603026650003203052650001503084650001603099650001503115650002203130650002003152650001903172650002103191650001403212650001203226650002403238650003303262650002603295650001503321650000903336650001503345650001103360650001403371650002003385650001503405650001603420653002503436653001403461653001503475653001903490700001703509700001503526700001603541700001703557700001903574700001603593700001703609700001603626710001903642773015403661856007903815852000903894655001203903IND60628928120221118224040.0190325e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062892812DNAL7 a10.3168/jds.2018-155332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDe Koster, J.10aPrediction of metabolic clusters in early-lactation dairy cows using models based on milk biomarkers  ap. 2631-2644.  aThe aim of this study was to describe metabolism of early-lactation dairy cows by clustering cows based on glucose, insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), free fatty acid, and β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) using the k-means method. Predictive models for metabolic clusters were created and validated using 3 sets of milk biomarkers (milk metabolites and enzymes, glycans on the immunogamma globulin fraction of milk, and Fourier-transform mid-infrared spectra of milk). Metabolic clusters are used to identify dairy cows with a balanced or imbalanced metabolic profile. Around 14 and 35 d in milk, serum or plasma concentrations of BHB, free fatty acids, glucose, and IGF-I were determined. Cows with a favorable metabolic profile were grouped together in what was referred to as the “balanced” group (n = 43) and were compared with cows in what was referred to as the “other balanced” group (n = 64). Cows with an unfavorable metabolic profile were grouped in what was referred to as the “imbalanced” group (n = 19) and compared with cows in what was referred to as the “other imbalanced” group (n = 88). Glucose and IGF-I were higher in balanced compared with other balanced cows. Free fatty acids and BHB were lower in balanced compared with other balanced cows. Glucose and IGF-I were lower in imbalanced compared with other imbalanced cows. Free fatty acids and BHB were higher in imbalanced cows. Metabolic clusters were related to production parameters. There was a trend for a higher daily increase in fat- and protein-corrected milk yield in balanced cows, whereas that of imbalanced cows was higher. Dry matter intake and the daily increase in dry matter intake were higher in balanced cows and lower in imbalanced cows. Energy balance was continuously higher in balanced cows and lower in imbalanced cows. Weekly or twice-weekly milk samples were taken and milk metabolites and enzymes (milk glucose, glucose-6-phosphate, BHB, lactate dehydrogenase, N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminidase, isocitrate), immunogamma globulin glycans (19 peaks), and Fourier-transform mid-infrared spectra (1,060 wavelengths reduced to 15 principal components) were determined. Milk biomarkers with or without additional cow information (days in milk, parity, milk yield features) were used to create predictive models for the metabolic clusters. Accuracy for prediction of balanced (80%) and imbalanced (88%) cows was highest using milk metabolites and enzymes combined with days in milk and parity. The results and models of the present study are part of the GplusE project and identify novel milk-based phenotypes that may be used as predictors for metabolic and performance traits in early-lactation dairy cows.  aPublisher supplied data 3a3-hydroxybutyric acid 3abeta-N-acetylhexosaminidase 3abiomarkers 3ablood serum 3adairy cows 3adry matter intake 3aearly lactation 3aenergy balance 3afree fatty acids 3aglobulins 3aglucose 3aglucose 6-phosphate 3ainsulin-like growth factor I 3alactate dehydrogenase 3ametabolism 3amilk 3amilk yield 3amodels 3aphenotype 3apolysaccharides 3aprediction 3awavelengths 0ametabolic clustering 0adairy cow 0aprediction 0amilk biomarker1 aSalavati, M.1 aGrelet, C.1 aCrowe, M.A.1 aMatthews, E.1 aO'Flaherty, R.1 aOpsomer, G.1 aFoldager, L.1 aHostens, M.2 aGplusEeauthor0 tJournal of dairy science.g2019 Mar., v. 102, no. 3 p.2631-2644dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2018-155333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02751naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002000142245009300162300001200255520191200267592002802179653003102207653001102238653001302249653001102262653000802273773010502281856007802386852000902464655001202473IND60127324120221116205150.0151110e200903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012732412DNAL7 a10.1653/024.092.01012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFunderburk, Joe10aManagement of the Western Flower Thrips (Thysanoptera: Thripidae) in Fruiting Vegetables  ap. 1-6.  aFeeding by the western flower thrips, Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande), causes damage to the fruits of vegetables, and the species is the key vector of Tomato spotted wilt virus. Frankliniella tritici (Fitch) and Frankliniella bispinosa (Morgan) are not pests of fruiting vegetables. Both species compete with F. occidentalis. Effective management of F. occidentalis in pepper integrates conservation of natural populations of the predator, Orius insidiosus (Say), with the use of reduced-risk insecticides such as spinetoram for the control of western flower thrips and other pests. Naturally occurring O. insidiosus are very effective predators and their effectiveness is predictable based on the number of the predator relative to the number of thrips prey. Populations of F. occidentalis resurge when natural enemies and competing thrips are killed. Some insecticides especially pyrethroids have beneficial effects on the development and reproduction of F. occidentalis. The predator O. insidiosus does not prefer tomato, and numbers remain too low in fields to suppress thrips. Tomato growers primarily rely on the use of ultra-violet reflective mulch combined, if needed, with the use of effective insecticides. Additional management efforts are needed in the future to manage F. occidentalis and other difficult pests in space and time. Management of the pepper weevil (Anthonomus eugenii Cano) is proving a challenge to pepper growers in central and southern Florida trying at the same time to manage F. occidentalis. Growers need to emphasize sanitation and other cultural tactics over the use of broad-spectrum insecticides that kill O. insidiosus and induce F. occidentalis in other ways. The identification of thrips in scouting programs also is critical as the use of broad-spectrum insecticides against populations of the non-pest flower thrips is inducing F. occidentalis to pest status.  aPublisher supplied data 0aFrankliniella occidentalis 0apepper 0aeggplant 0atomato 0aIPM0 tFlorida entomologist.g2009 Mar., v. 92, no. 1 p.1-6dFlorida Entomological Societyx0015-40407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1653%2F024.092.01013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03295naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002400094040001800118100001900136245016100155300001600316500002000332520208100352592002802433650001302461650001202474650001502486650001302501650001202514650001402526650002002540650001602560650001102576650002202587651002002609651001102629700002702640700001902667700001802686773010102704856007102805852000902876655001202885IND60787234820221120154447.0220808e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078723482DNAL7 a10.12705/675.72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBorsch, Thomas10aPollen characters and DNA sequence data converge on a monophyletic genus Iresine (Amaranthaceae, Caryophyllales) and help to elucidate its species diversity  ap. 944-976.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIresine is a neotropical genus of the Amaranthaceae with most of the species diversity in Mexico and Mesoamerica. It has suffered a complex classification history with considerably diverging views on the genus concept. We have carried out a phylogenetic analysis of Iresine and allied genera using sequence data of combined plastid introns (including the matK CDS) and spacers as well as ITS, and a dense sampling of species. Trees depict a clade of Iresine with Irenella and Woehleria deeply nested. This clade is sister to the remainder of Gomphrenoideae including Hebanthe and Trommsdorffia (≡ Pedersenia). One of two maximally supported subclades of Iresine comprises mostly species restricted to the Mexican highlands and adjacent areas, whereas the other subclade is composed of more widespread Mexican‐Mesoamerican taxa. Pollen grains of Iresine and relatives were examined using high‐resolution SEM, which yielded a matrix of 15 pollen characters. Ancestral character state reconstruction shows dodecahedral grains (in I. angustifolia and I. nigra) to have evolved within the Iresine clade, not involving the complete suite of character shifts associated with metareticulate pollen but just an increase of aperture diameter and a slight decrease of mesoporia width. To the contrary, four character state transformations occurred in the common ancestor of core Gomphrenoideae that led to metareticulate pollen (shifts to a distal orientation of punctae and microspines, to a sunken position of apertures relative to the distal part of mesoporia resulting in narrow mesoporia higher then wide, and a reduction in the diameter of mesoporia). The Iresine clade is characterized by pollen with well‐separated ektexinous aperture membrane bodies, rounded or triangular, and gradually tapering into a single spine. For the monophyletic genus Iresine, 35 species are currently accepted. We provide a taxonomic backbone (including one new combination, one new name and several lectotypifications) that also comments on the current understanding of species delimitation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHebanthe 3aIresine 3aNeotropics 3aancestry 3aintrons 3amonophyly 3anew combination 3anomen novum 3apollen 3aspecies diversity 3aCentral America 3aMexico1 aFlores‐Olvera, Hilda1 aZumaya, Silvia1 aMüller, Kai,0 tTaxon.g2018 Oct., v. 67, no. 5 p.944-976dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:1964x0040-02627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.12705/675.73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04295naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245014900169300001600318520268700334592002803021650001103049650002003060650001503080650001503095650001603110650001603126650001003142650001103152650001603163650001903179650001303198650001203211650002103223650001503244653001103259653001603270653001603286653001203302653001603314653003403330653001003364653001603374700002103390700002003411700001803431700002103449700002003470700002203490700002703512773010003539856008103639852000903720655001203729IND60545070020221120132531.0160901e20150901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054507002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rse.2015.06.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUrbazaev, Mikhail10aAssessment of the mapping of fractional woody cover in southern African savannas using multi-temporal and polarimetric ALOS PALSAR L-band images  ap. 138-153.  aWoody vegetation cover affects several ecosystem processes including carbon and water cycling, energy fluxes, and fire regimes. In order to understand the dynamics of savanna ecosystems, information on the spatial distribution of woody vegetation over large areas is needed. In this study we sought to assess multi-temporal ALOS PALSAR L-band backscatter to map woody cover in southern African savannas. The SAR data were acquired from the JAXA archive, covering various modes and seasons between 2007 and 2010. We used high resolution airborne LiDAR data as reference data to interpret SAR parameters (including backscatter intensities and polarimetric decomposition components), to develop SAR-based models as well as to validate SAR-based woody cover maps. The LiDAR survey was carried out in April 2008 with the Carnegie Airborne Observatory (CAO, http://cao.ciw.edu). The highest correlations to the reference data were obtained from SAR backscatters of the dry season, followed by the wet season, and the end of the wet season. The volume components from polarimetric decompositions (Freeman-Durden, Van Zyl) were calculated for the end of wet season, and showed similar correlations to the LiDAR data, when compared to cross-polarized backscatters (HV). We observed increased correlation between the SAR and LiDAR datasets with an increase in the spatial scale at which datasets were integrated, with an optimum value at 50m. We modeled woody cover using three scenarios: (1) a single date scenario (i.e., woody cover map based on a single SAR image), (2) a multi-seasonal scenario (i.e., woody cover map based on SAR images from the same year and different seasons, based on key phonological difference), and (3) a multi-annual scenario (i.e., woody cover map based on SAR data from different years). Predicted SAR-based woody cover map based on Fine Beam Dual Polarization dry season SAR backscatters of all years yielded the best performance with an R2 of 0.71 and RMSE of 7.88%. However, single dry season SAR backscatter achieved only a slightly lower accuracy (R2=0.66, RMSE=8.45%) as multi-annual SAR data, suggesting that a single SAR scene from the dry season can also be used for woody cover mapping. Moreover, we investigated the impact of the number of samples on the model prediction performance and showed the benefits of a larger spatially explicit LiDAR dataset compared to much smaller number of samples as they can be collected in the field. Collectively, our results demonstrate that L-band backscatter shows promising sensitivity for the purposes of mapping woody cover in southern African savannas, particularly during the dry season leaf-off conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3adata collection 3adry season 3aecosystems 3aenergy flow 3afire regime 3alidar 3amodels 3apolarimetry 3aremote sensing 3asavannas 3asurveys 3avegetation cover 3awet season 0aL-band 0aBackscatter 0aALOS PALSAR 0aSavanna 0aWoody cover 0aCarnegie Airborne Observatory 0aLiDAR 0aSeasonality1 aThiel, Christian1 aMathieu, Renaud1 aNaidoo, Laven1 aLevick, Shaun R.1 aSmit, Izak P.J.1 aAsner, Gregory P.1 aSchmullius, Christiane0 tRemote sensing of environment.g2015 Sept. 01, v. 166 p.138-153dElsevier Inc.x0034-42577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2015.06.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03015naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094024002200137024001900159040001800178100001700196245013600213300001400349506007600363520131300439592002801752506003701780650002801817650001301845650001901858650001001877650001501887650003101902650001301933650001401946650001401960650001801974650001301992650001402005651001002019653002802029653003102057653002602088700001602114700001702130700001402147700001602161700001702177700001902194700001902213773014202232856009002374852000902464655001202473IND60541144920221207131630.0190318e20150504xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054114492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2014.12.0092doi7 aPMC46677192pmcid7 a256627082pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Baisheng10aPhenotypic and phylogenetic analysis of Vibrio parahaemolyticus isolates recovered from diarrhea cases in Guangdong Province, China  ap. 13-17.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aVibrio parahaemolyticus has emerged as a common foodborne pathogen of global concern. In this study, 108 V. parahaemolyticus isolates that recovered from diarrhea cases (n=96) and seafood products (n=12) in Guangdong Province from 2007 to 2011 were characterized by serotyping, tdh and trh toxin gene detection and multilocus sequence typing (MLST). The dominant serotypes from the cases were O3:K6, O4:K8 and O1: KUT (untyped). However, most isolates recovered from seafood products belonged to other serotypes. None of the isolates carried the trh gene, while the major isolates from the cases were tdh positive. MLST analysis revealed 31 sequence types (STs); 17 STs were unique in this study. eBURST analysis revealed four clonal complexes (CC), The majority of the isolates (n=58, all from cases and tdh+) were grouped into the CC3, which included O3:K6, O4:K68 and O1:KUT isolates. The CC3 was the most prevalent clonal complex, and all of the CC3 isolates were recovered from clinical cases of geographically diverse origin. As to the CC345, which was completely constituted by O4:K8, was another important clonal complex affecting Guangdong Province. Ongoing surveillance of V. parahaemolyticus in diarrhea patients and seafood products remains a public health priority for Guangdong Province, China.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aVibrio parahaemolyticus 3adiarrhea 3afood pathogens 3agenes 3amonitoring 3amultilocus sequence typing 3apatients 3aphenotype 3aphylogeny 3apublic health 3aseafoods 3aserotypes 3aChina 0aVibrio parahaemolyticus 0aMultilocus sequence typing 0aPhylogenetic analysis1 aLuo, Jinyan1 aTan, Hailing1 aKe, Bixia1 aHe, Dongmei1 aKe, Changwen1 aKlena, John D.1 aZhang, Yonghui0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2015 May 04, v. 200 p.13-17dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl35565x0168-16057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2014.12.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03362naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245011400173300001400287520197800301592002802279650001802307650001402325650001602339650002702355650001202382650003102394650001202425650002702437650001402464653001902478653001202497653002502509653001602534653001102550653001602561700001902577700002402596700002102620700002202641700002202663700002502685773008802710856008502798852000902883655001202892IND60611931620221121021100.0181002e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061193162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biochi.2018.07.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoussicault, Lydie10aCYP46A1 protects against NMDA-mediated excitotoxicity in Huntington's disease: Analysis of lipid raft content  ap. 70-79.  aHuntington's Disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease caused by abnormal polyglutamine expansion in huntingtin (mHtt) protein leading to degeneration of striatal neurons. Excitotoxicity, consecutive to overstimulation of N-methyl d-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) has a pivotal role in many neurological disorders including HD. Mutant Htt causes enhanced NMDA sensitivity, alteration of NMDAR expression and localization in neurons. Excitotoxic events initiate neuronal death in numerous ways, including activation of apoptotic cascades. Among the NMDAR subunits involved in glutamatergic-mediated excitotoxicity, GluN2B has been extensively reported. In addition to excitotoxicity, alteration of cholesterol metabolism has been observed in HD, with a decrease of cholesterol precursor synthesis along with an increase of cholesterol accumulation, which is deleterious for neurons. Expression of Cholesterol Hydroxylase enzyme, CYP46A1, which converts cholesterol into 24 S-hydroxycholesterol is down-regulated in HD. We found that CYP46A1 overexpression is beneficial in HD neurons and mouse model, but the mechanisms involved still remain unclear. In this study we addressed the effect of CYP46A1 on NMDAR-mediated excitotoxicity in HD primary neurons and its role in modulating cholesterol and localization of GLUN2B in lipid rafts. We showed that CYP46A1 is protective against NMDAR-mediated excitotoxicity in two different HD neuronal cell models. Cholesterol as well as GluN2B level in lipid raft, are significantly increased by mHtt. Despite a clear effect of CYP46A1 in reducing cholesterol content in lipid raft extracts from wild type neurons, CYP46A1 overexpression in HD neurons could not normalize the increased cholesterol levels in lipid rafts. This study highlights the beneficial role of CYP46A1 against NMDAR-mediated excitotoxicity and gives further insights into the cellular mechanisms underlying CYP46A1-mediated neuroprotection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal models 3aapoptosis 3acholesterol 3acholesterol metabolism 3amutants 3aneurodegenerative diseases 3aneurons 3aneuroprotective effect 3areceptors 0aExcitotoxicity 0aCYP46A1 0aHuntington's disease 0aLipid rafts 0aGluN2B 0aCholesterol1 aKacher, Radhia1 aLamazière, Antonin1 aVanhoutte, Peter1 aCaboche, Jocelyne1 aBetuing, Sandrine1 aPotier, Marie-Claude0 tBiochimie.g2018 Oct., v. 153 p.70-79dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6254x0300-90847nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biochi.2018.07.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03666naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004300092040001800135100002200153245010600175300001600281520211500297592002802412650001502440650001702455650001402472650002002486650002002506650001402526650001002540650001702550650001302567650001502580650001102595650002602606650001102632650001002643650001602653650001002669650001402679650001302693650001302706650001102719650001302730650001302743650002302756650001202779650001202791700002902803700002102832700004002853700001902893773009002912856008903002852000903091655001203100IND4459062420221118223604.0141110e20110727xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445906242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2011.05.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGalaviz, Mario A.10aOntogeny of the digestive tract and enzymatic activity in white seabass, Atractoscion nobilis, larvae  ap. 162-168.  aThe development of the digestive system and digestive enzyme activity in white seabass larvae, Atractoscion nobilis, were analyzed from hatching until 40days post hatch (dph) using histological and biochemical approaches. The development of the digestive system in A. nobilis larvae was similar to that reported for other marine fish species. Larvae at 3dph (0.55±0.001mg wet weight and 3.6±0.02mm total length), cultured at 18°C in seawater, presented all the structures (i.e. differentiation of the alimentary canal into the buccopharynx, esophagus, anterior and posterior intestines, pancreas with zymogen granules, liver, gall bladder and open mouth) necessary for the digestion and absorption of nutrients such as proteins and lipids (primarily). At this time, the larvae had fully-developed digestive systems that allowed them to digest inert feed and to absorb nutrients throughout the intestine walls. On the other hand, most digestive enzyme activities were detected at the moment of hatching. Trypsin activity was 0.80±0.16mU/mg protein at 1dph (0.51±0.001mg wet weight larvae), and increased gradually during the following days, but most notably after the initial exogenous feeding at 4dph. The specific activity of chymotrypsin was 7.21±1.29mU×10⁻⁴/mg protein at 1dph and reached peak level (15.9±1.02 mU×10⁻⁴/mg protein) at 18dph (6.6±0.003mg wet weight larvae). The specific activity of leucine aminopeptidase increased continuously from 1.31±0.05mU×10⁻³/mg protein at 1dph to 15.91±0.40mU×10⁻³/mg protein at 18dph. The activity of α-amylase at 1dph was 1.35±0.09U/mg protein, increasing to 8.07±0.98U/mg protein at 16dph. The activity of pepsin was detected at a very low level (0.71±0.53U/mg protein) at 10dph, and a stepwise increase in activity was observed between 16 and 20dph, reaching maximum level (13.92±0.09U/mg protein) at 40dph. These results indicate that the digestive tract develops rapidly in this species and that the stomach becomes functional between 16 and 18dph. It should, therefore, be possible to start weaning the fish at this young age.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3achymotrypsin 3adigestion 3adigestive tract 3aenzyme activity 3aesophagus 3afeeds 3agall bladder 3ahatching 3aintestines 3alarvae 3aleucyl aminopeptidase 3alipids 3aliver 3amarine fish 3amouth 3anutrients 3aontogeny 3apancreas 3apepsin 3aproteins 3aseawater 3asecretory granules 3astomach 3atrypsin1 aGarcía-Gasca, Alejandra1 aDrawbridge, Mark1 aÁlvarez González, Carlos Alfonso,1 aLópez, Lus M.0 tAquaculture.g2011 July 27, v. 318, no. 1-2 p.162-168dElsevier B.V.x0044-84867nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2011.05.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03144naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001700155245009000172300001400262520158900276592002801865650000801893650002301901650002101924650000801945650001901953650001201972650001301984650001801997650001402015650001802029650001202047650003202059650003702091650002302128650001602151650001902167653000802186653001802194653001202212700001902224700003002243700003102273700002202304700002302326700001902349700001902368773012802387856009002515852000902605655001202614IND60541145020221120222302.0190318e20150316xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054114502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2014.12.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSanz, Susana10aAirborne dissemination of Escherichia coli in a dairy cattle farm and its environment  ap. 40-44.  aThere are multiple ways bacteria can be transported from its origin to another area or substrate. Water, food handlers, insects and other animals are known to serve as a vehicle for bacterial dispersion. However, the importance of the air in open areas as a possible way of bacterial dissemination has not been so well analyzed. In this study, we investigated the airborne dissemination of Escherichia coli from the inside of a dairy cattle farm to the immediate environment. The air samples were taken inside the farm (area 0) and from the immediate outside farm surroundings at distance of 50, 100 and 150m in four directions (north, south, east, and west). At each point, the air was collected at different heights: 40cm, 70cm and 1m. The sampling was carried out in two weather seasons (November and July). E. coli was isolated in both inside and outside air, even in samples taken 150m from the farm. A seasonal effect was observed with more bacterial isolates when temperature was higher. Regarding the distribution of the isolates, wind direction appeared as a determining factor. In order to verify that E. coli strains isolated from animal housing facilities were identical to those isolated from the air of the immediate farm environment, their genomic DNA profiles were analyzed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) after digestion with the endonuclease XbaI. The comparison of genetic profiles suggested that the strains isolated from inside and outside the farm were related, leading to the conclusion that the air is an important vehicle for E. coli dissemination.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDNA fingerprinting 3aEscherichia coli 3aair 3aanimal housing 3aanimals 3abacteria 3adairy farming 3adigestion 3afood handling 3ainsects 3alivestock and meat industry 3apulsed-field gel electrophoresis 3aseasonal variation 3atemperature 3awind direction 0aAir 0aDissemination 0aE. coli1 aOlarte, Carmen1 aMartínez-Olarte, Roberto1 aNavajas-Benito, Enrique V.1 aAlonso, C.

In China, to address severe air pollution in the Yangtze River Delta region, the local government has formulated Five-Year Plans to set the road map for air pollution control by phased targets in 2020, but the effectiveness of these policies is still uncertain. There is therefore a need for accurate prediction of control strategies. Here we present a computational evaluation of the predicted effectiveness of four emission control strategies: normal or enhanced emission reduction for industry and power plants, and normal or enhanced emission reduction for industry, power plants and transportation, designed on the basis of policies of the 13th Five-Year Plans. Effectiveness was tested on concentrations of PM₂.₅, e.g., particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 μm, using the two-way coupled Weather Research and Forecasting—Community Multiscale Air Quality (WRF-CMAQ) model. Results show that by implementing the four emission control strategies, only Hangzhou with the strictest emission controls in four main cities (Hangzhou, Hefei, Nanjing and Shanghai) can meet the 20% reduction goals of PM₂.₅ concentrations in the 13th Five-Year Plan, indicating that current policies are not sufficient to control the severe air pollution in the Yangtze River Delta region. Sensitivity tests show that residential emissions have the highest contributions to the PM₂.₅ concentrations in January in the four main cities of Hangzhou, Hefei, Nanjing and Shanghai, followed by agriculture, industry, transportation and power plants. Predicted annual mean reduction percentages for PM₂.₅ are the highest in Hangzhou, from − 9.7 to − 20.1%, followed by Nanjing, from − 8.2 to − 18.7%, Shanghai, from − 7.4 to − 15.8%, and Hefei, from − 6.1 to − 13.8%. This finding highlights the predominance of residential emissions, which should be better controlled, notably coal burning. By comparison, predicted annual contributions of regional transport and natural sources to mean PM₂.₅ concentrations in four cities range from 29.2 to 36.6%. Overall, a major finding is that residential sources are of comparable importance to industrial, power plant and transportation sources to PM₂.₅ concentrations, especially for winter. This information will help governments of other regions of China, as well as other developing countries, to formulate more appropriate emission control strategies where coal is used for heating and cooking purposes in the developing countries.  aPublisher supplied data  a21577126cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aair pollution 3aair quality 3aburning 3acities 3acoal 3acooking 3adeveloping countries 3aemissions 3aindustry 3aissues and policy 3alocal government 3amodels 3aparticulates 3apollution control 3apower plants 3aprediction 3ariver deltas 3atransportation 3aweather 3awinter 3aChina 3aYangtze River1 aWang, Peng1 aYu, Shaocai1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9718-82461 aWang, Liqiang1 aLi, Pengfei1 aLi, Zhen1 aMeman, K̲h̲ālid Maḥmūd,1 aLiu, Weiping1 aWu, Jian1 aLichtfouse, Eric1 aRosenfeld, Daniel1 aSeinfeld, John H.0 tEnvironmental chemistry letters.g2018 Sept., v. 16, no. 3 p.1117-1127dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:J000000202x1610-36537nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10311-018-0735-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02062naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245009700171300001600268520112200284592002801406650001101434650002601445650001501471650001901486650000901505650001501514700001901529700002501548773008001573856008601653852000901739655001201748IND60085014920221116200152.0141101e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008501492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2013.03.0412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPoncela, Marta10aAutomatic tuning of Kalman filters by maximum likelihood methods for wind energy forecasting  ap. 349-362.  aWind energy has the advantages of being clean, having a zero-cost primary energy source (wind) and having low operating and maintenance costs. Despite these advantages, it is difficult to manage due to its variable condition. Recently, there has been an explosion of forecasting tools to integrate wind energy into the electrical grid. This paper is devoted to improve the performance of statistical tools based on Kalman filter models. We substitute the traditional way of setting the values of the model parameters by estimating them by quasi maximum likelihood methods for a certain forecast horizon. It produces an automatic self-tuning of the model parameters for each particular wind farm. We show that this brings the models close to an optimum for all the horizons. We also propose new multivariate models to capture the effect of missing inputs on the predicted power. We have applied our methodology in several wind farms and the results show that these two approaches always provide more accurate predictions, with up to 60% of improvement for the RMSE. Finally, we propose a real-time estimation strategy.  aPublisher supplied data 3amodels 3amultivariate analysis 3aprediction 3aprimary energy 3awind 3awind power1 aPoncela, Pilar1 aPerán, José Ramón0 tApplied energy.g2013 Aug., v. 108 p.349-362dElsevier Ltdx0306-26197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2013.03.0413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03150naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005200150245014500202300001800347520181900365592002802184650001502212650001102227650001302238650001502251650001202266650001102278650001402289650001402303650001302317650001002330650002302340700005302363700001502416700005502431700005802486773011402544856008502658852000902743655001202752IND60771928220221122104305.0220330e20220317xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077192822DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.1c024082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPang, Yu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7247-163210aEvaluation of Gas Adsorption in Nanoporous Shale by Simplified Local Density Model Integrated with Pore Structure and Pore Size Distribution  ap. 3641-3655.  aSimplified local density (SLD) model has been widely used to describe the gas adsorption behaviors in porous media. However, the slit pore geometry and constant pore width associated with the SLD model may fail to represent the heterogeneous pore network structure in shale. In this study, a new method to integrate the SLD model with the slit and cylindrical pore structures as well as the pore size distribution (PSD) is proposed and validated by the grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations and the experimentally measured adsorption of methane on shale with complex pore network. Comparison results show that reasonably good agreement is achieved between the SLD model and GCMC simulations for both the gas adsorption isotherms and discrete-density profiles in multiwalled carbon nanoslit and nanotube. The corresponding average absolute percentage deviations (% AADs) are below 0.3 and 9.3 for gas adsorption isotherm and discrete-density profile, respectively. In addition, the SLD model coupled with the PSD of slit and cylindrical pores ranging from micro- to macropores properly characterizes the measured excess adsorption of methane on Wolfcamp shale core sample with % AADs between 1.7 and 3.6. It is found that when the pore volume is fixed, the gas adsorption isotherm and gas density profile are heavily dependent on the pore geometry and pore size. Furthermore, integrating the PSD into the SLD model can guarantee the valid identification of the adsorbed- and free-gas regions in flow channels with different sizes based on the gas density profiles. The findings of this study shed light on the effects of pore structure on gas adsorption in nanopores and enable us to precisely evaluate and predict the gas adsorption behaviors in slit and cylindrical pores over a wide range of pore sizes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acarbon 3ageometry 3amacropores 3amethane 3amodels 3ananopores 3ananotubes 3aporosity 3ashale 3asorption isotherms1 aWang, Sen1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2472-62041 aYao, Xinyu1 aHu, Xiaofei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5178-91901 aChen, Shengnan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1704-10070 tLangmuir.g2022 Mar. 17, v. 38, no. 12 p.3641-3655dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19170x1520-58277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.1c024083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02135naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001800142245014200160300001400302520114100316592002801457653002301485653001101508653001401519653001301533653001601546700002601562700002101588700001801609773010701627856007801734852000901812655001201821IND60127324720221116205053.0151110e200903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012732472DNAL7 a10.1653/024.092.01082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTormos, Josep10aDescription of the Mature Larva of the Sand Wasp Bembix bidentata and Its Parasitoids (Hymenoptera: Crabronidae, Chrysididae, Mutillidae)  ap. 43-53.  aThe mature larvae of Bembix bidentata and one of its chrysidid and mutillid parasitoids are described and illustrated, and structures of phylogenetic value are discussed. The mature larva of B. bidentata is characterized by an integument with short setae (< 40 µµm) and scanty microspinules. The ratio between the length of the antennal papilla and the width of the antennal orbit is a character state that can be used in the separation of the final instar of European Bembix species. The mature larva of Chrysidea disclusa is characterized by a combination of two character states: (1) an atrium without asperities or weak lines on the circumference, and (2) antennal papillae longer than broad; the larval morphology of Chrysidea previously was unknown. The mature larva of Chrysura hybrida is characterized, within the genus Chrysura, by the autapomorphy ““maxillary palpus with 4 sensilla at apex.”” The range of hosts of Chrysura spp. is broadened to the Crabronidae. The mature larva of Smicromyrme rufipes is characterized, within the Mutillinae, by having more than 8 apical setae and no apical papillae on the labium.  aPublisher supplied data 0aPreimaginal stages 0aBembix 0aChrysidea 0aChrysura 0aSmicromyrme1 aAsíís, Josep Daniel1 aBeneitez, Amparo1 aGayubo, S.

The approach mimicked gastric and/or duodenal digestion. Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 and Saccharomyces boulardii were used as reference strains. We studied the microorganisms grown separately in culture medium and then included (or not) in a rennet gel. The microorganisms' immunomodulatory abilities were also assessed by profiling cytokine induction in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). The loss of viability was less than 1logCFU/mL for yeasts under all conditions. In contrast, Gram-negative bacteria survived gastric and/or duodenal stress well but most of the Gram-positive bacteria were more sensitive (especially to gastric stress). Inclusion of sensitive Gram-positive bacteria in rennet gel dramatically improved gastric survival, when compared with a non-included cultured (with a 4logCFU/mL change in survival). However, the rennet gel did not protect the bacteria against duodenal stress. The PBMC cytokine assay tests showed that the response to yeasts was usually anti-inflammatory, whereas the response to bacteria varied from one strain to another.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aGram-positive bacteria 3aLactobacillus rhamnosus 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae var. cerevisiae 3acheeses 3aculture media 3acytokines 3adigestion 3agels 3ahumans 3aimmunomodulators 3amononuclear leukocytes 3arennet 3astress response 3aviability 3ayeasts 0aSmear-ripened cheese microbiota 0aPeripheral blood mononuclear cell 0aImmunomodulation 0aIn vitro digestive model 0aDigestive stress1 aFoligné, Benoît1 aDewulf, Joëlle1 aBouix, Marielle1 aPicque, Daniel1 aBonnarme, Pascal0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2015 Mar. 16, v. 197 p.98-107dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl35565x0168-16057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2014.12.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02185naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001900142245017300161300001400334520118800348592002801536653001701564653002201581653002001603653001401623700001701637700001701654700001801671773010701689856007801796852000901874655001201883IND60127324820221116204806.0151110e200903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012732482DNAL7 a10.1653/024.092.01102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPortman, S.

(Hymenoptera: Crabronidae) is a specialist parasitoid of Scapteriscus (Orthoptera: Gryllotalpidae) mole crickets, attacking adults and medium to large nymphs. Reproductive systems were dissected from 10 female wasps collected in northern Florida. Each had 2 ovaries, each with 3 ovarioles. The maximal number of mature eggs (10) plus developing oocytes (83) was 93. Female wasps deposit an egg on the venter of the host's thorax, and the wasp larva develops as an ectoparasitoid. Twenty newly-emerged female wasps housed in small cages with at least 1 male and with 7 potential hosts replaced daily deposited a mean 2.44 eggs (range 0––10) per day for a total lifetime production averaging 56 eggs (range 17––91) during a lifespan averaging 23.5 d (range 8––40). Assuming 3 wasp generations with fecundity as shown to 1 host generation, per year, the wasp should easily be able to outreproduce its host mole crickets. A few of the hosts became superparasitized with 2 or even 3 eggs, but at most 1 larva of L. bicolor developed successfully on each host, so superparasitism is a disadvantage; its incidence in the laboratory (<2%) and field (3%) was low.  aPublisher supplied data 0areproduction 0aovarian structure 0asuperparasitism 0afertility1 aFrank, J.

One of the potential alternatives to effectively degrade PPCPs is based on the use of white-rot fungi (WRF) and involves the oxidative action of extracellular fungal enzymes. The aim of this work is to study the potential ability of three WRF strains, an anamorph species of Bjerkandera sp. R1, Bjerkandera adusta and Phanerochaete chrysosporium, to degrade PPCPs belonging to different therapeutic groups: anti-depressants (citalopram and fluoxetine), antibiotics (sulfamethoxazole), anti-inflammatory drugs (diclofenac, ibuprofen and naproxen), anti-epileptics (carbamazepine), tranquilizers (diazepam) and fragrances (celestolide, galaxolide and tonalide). The results reported complete degradation of all the PPCPs except for fluoxetine and diazepam, which were partially removed in percentages from 23 to 57%. In the case of fragrances, these compounds were neither detected in the fungal cultures nor in the abiotic controls, indicating the possibility of volatilization during the experiment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBjerkandera adusta 3aPhanerochaete chrysosporium 3aantibiotics 3adiazepam 3aenzymes 3aibuprofen 3apersonal care products 3asulfamethoxazole 3atranquilizers 3avolatilization 3awastewater treatment 3awhite-rot fungi1 aFeijoo, G.1 aMoreira, M.

It is thus important to reduce virus numbers on these foods. Prevention of virus contamination in fresh produce production and processing may be more effective than treatment, as sufficient virus removal or inactivation by post-harvest treatment requires high doses that may adversely affect food quality. To date knowledge of the contribution of various potential contamination routes is lacking. A risk assessment model was developed for human norovirus, hepatitis A virus and human adenovirus in raspberry and salad vegetable supply chains to quantify contributions of potential contamination sources to the contamination of produce at retail. These models were used to estimate public health risks. Model parameterization was based on monitoring data from European supply chains and literature data. No human pathogenic viruses were found in the soft fruit supply chains; human adenovirus (hAdV) was detected, which was additionally monitored as an indicator of fecal pollution to assess the contribution of potential contamination points. Estimated risks per serving of lettuce based on the models were 3×10−4 (6×10−6–5×10−3) for NoV infection and 3×10−8 (7×10−10–3×10−6) for hepatitis A jaundice. The contribution to virus contamination of hand-contact was larger as compared with the contribution of irrigation, the conveyor belt or the water used for produce rinsing. In conclusion, viral contamination in the lettuce and soft fruit supply chains occurred and estimated health risks were generally low. Nevertheless, the 97.5% upper limit for the estimated NoV contamination of lettuce suggested that infection risks up to 50% per serving might occur. Our study suggests that attention to full compliance for hand hygiene will improve fresh produce safety related to virus risks most as compared to the other examined sources, given the monitoring results. This effect will be further aided by compliance with other hygiene and water quality regulations in production and processing facilities.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahepatitis 3afresh produce 3afarm to fork 3arisk 3apublic health 3airrigation 3acompliance 3afood quality 3arisk assessment 3apollution 3aviruses 3ajaundice 3apostharvest treatment 3awater quality 3ahumans 3amonitoring 3amodels 3alettuce 3aNorovirus 3ahygiene 3agastroenteritis 3araspberries 3asalads 3aHepatovirus A 0aQMRA 0aViruses 0aStrawberries 0aLettuce 0aHepatitis A virus 0aIntervention 0aRaspberries1 aVerhaelen, Katharina1 aRzeżutka, Artur1 aKozyra, Iwona1 aMaunula, Leena1 avon Bonsdorff, Carl-Henrik1 aVantarakis, Apostolos1 aKokkinos, Petros1 aPetrovic, Tamas1 aLazic, Sava1 aPavlík, Ivo,1 aVasickova, Petra1 aWillems, Kris A.1 aHavelaar, Arie H.1 aRutjes, Saskia A.1 ade Roda Husman, Ana Maria0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2015 Apr. 02, v. 198 p.50-58dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl35565x0168-16057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2014.12.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02962naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245015000167300001800317520132800335592002801663650004801691650001601739650001101755650001201766650001301778650001001791650002601801650003101827650000901858650002101867650001701888650004101905650001701946650001601963650001101979650002001990650001802010653001802028653001402046653002102060700002302081700002102104700001802125700002202143700002202165700002402187773012802211856008402339852000902423655001202432IND60121739420221123011642.0150324e20141102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012173942DNAL7 a10.1080/15226514.2013.8214472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChang, Pearl10aPlant Growth-Promoting Bacteria Facilitate the Growth of Barley and Oats in Salt-Impacted Soil: Implications for Phytoremediation of Saline Soils  ap. 1133-1147.  aPlant growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB) strains that contain the enzyme 1-amino- cyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) deaminase can lower stress ethylene levels and improve plant growth. In this study, ACC deaminase - producing bacteria were isolated from a salt-impacted (∼50 dS/m) farm field, and their ability to promote plant growth of barley and oats in saline soil was investigated in pouch assays (1% NaCl), greenhouse trials (9.4 dS/m), and field trials (6–24 dS/m). A mix of previously isolated PGPB strains UW3 (Pseudomonas sp.) and UW4 (P . sp.) was also tested for comparison. Rhizobacterial isolate CMH3 (P. corrugata) and UW3+UW4 partially alleviated plant salt stress in growth pouch assays. In greenhouse trials, CMH3 enhanced root biomass of barley and oats by 200% and 50%, respectively. UW3+UW4, CMH3 and isolate CMH2 also enhanced barley and oat shoot growth by 100%–150%. In field tests, shoot biomass of oats tripled when treated with UW3+UW4 and doubled with CHM3 compared with that of untreated plants. PGPB treatment did not affect salt uptake on a per mass basis; higher plant biomass led to greater salt uptake, resulting in decreased soil salinity. This study demonstrates a method for improving plant growth in marginal saline soils. Associated implications for salt remediation are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3a1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate deaminase 3aPseudomonas 3abarley 3abiomass 3aethylene 3afarms 3afield experimentation 3agreenhouse experimentation 3aoats 3aphytoremediation 3aplant growth 3aplant growth-promoting rhizobacteria 3asaline soils 3asalt stress 3ashoots 3asodium chloride 3asoil salinity 0aACC deaminase 0aPGPB/PGPR 0asalt remediation1 aGerhardt, Karen E.1 aHuang, Xiao-Dong1 aYu, Xiao-Ming1 aGlick, Bernard R.1 aGerwing, Perry D.1 aGreenberg, Bruce M.0 tInternational journal of phytoremediation.g2014 Nov. 2, v. 16, no. 11 p.1133-1147dTaylor & Francis Groupx1549-78797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15226514.2013.8214473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02650naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245006500173300001400238520144300252536009501695592002801790596001901818650001601837650001101853650001401864650003101878650001701909650001801926650001001944650000901954653002901963653002401992653001602016653001402032773012302046856008602169852000902255655001202264IND60759863920221117170401.0220910e20210101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075986392DNAL7 a10.1080/24750263.2020.18569502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMitrus, Sławomir10aNo effect of lack of wood for acorn ant colonies development  ap. 77-85.  aAcorn ants mostly inhabit cavities in fallen twigs and hollow acorns. Such places, e.g., dead wood, provide an attractive living resource for many groups of microorganisms, like fungi and bacteria, which can be important for ants. However, during experiments in laboratories, acorn ant colonies are typically kept without dead wood. During laboratory experiments, the preferences of the ant Temnothorax crassispinus for nest sites with pieces of dead wood were checked, and whether the presence of such wood influenced productivity. In binary choice tests, colonies had to choose a nest site when presented with two potential nest sites, one empty, or two cavities with different contents. The ant colonies preferred nest cavities with pieces of dead wood versus empty nest cavities. When cavities were filled with pieces of wood or with pieces of wood previously sterilized (72 hours, 70°C), colonies preferred the unsterilized zones. During a three-month laboratory experiment, colonies were kept in the Petri dishes containing pieces of dead wood, containing “sterilised” pieces of dead wood, or without access to wood. In the experiment, no influence was discovered on the availability of dead wood in either colony growth or colony per capita productivity. Thus, the ants prefer cavities with pieces of wood, but the lack of availability of dead wood during a multi-month experiment has no influence on life history parameters.  aThis work was supported by the Institute of Biology, University of Opole [2018/18-13-108].  aPublisher supplied data  a2018/18-13-108 3aTemnothorax 3aacorns 3adead wood 3alaboratory experimentation 3alife history 3anesting sites 3anests 3awood 0aTemnothorax crassispinus 0acollective decision 0anest choice 0abehaviour0 tThe European zoological journal.g2021 Jan. 01, v. 88, no. 1 p.77-85dTaylor & FranciswJournal:27397x2475-02637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/24750263.2020.18569503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02870naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245014500166300001200311520126700323592002801590596006701618650002901685650001901714650001301733650001101746650001401757650001201771650001701783650002501800650001001825650001101835650002401846650001401870650002601884650001401910650002201924650001501946650001901961650002101980650001802001650001302019650001802032651001002050700002102060700002902081773015102110856008202261852000902343655001202352IND60606193220221121190738.0181002e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060619322DNAL7 a10.1007/s10661-018-6840-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRath, Aseem R.10aPhytoplankton community structure in relation to environmental factors from the New Mangalore Port waters along the southwest coast of India  ap. 481.  aSeasonal and spatial phytoplankton distribution in relation to environmental factors was investigated in New Mangalore Port, a major port along the west coast of India. A well-mixed water column characterized the non-monsoon seasons, whereas it was weakly stratified during monsoon. Water quality index (TRIX) scores indicated good water quality except during pre-monsoon (inner zone surface) and monsoon (near bottom waters). Surface abundance of tychopelagic diatoms (Paralia sulcata, Melosira nummuloides, Cylindrotheca closterium, and Nitzschia sigma) was higher during non-monsoon seasons. Certain centric diatoms, e.g., Leptocylindrus danicus, P. sulcata, and Rhizosolenia imbricata, dominated during pre-monsoon (inner zone) and positively correlated with TRIX. High Skeletonema costatum and dinoflagellate abundance during the monsoon season coincided with high nutrient concentrations. Five potential toxic and fourteen harmful/bloom forming algal species were encountered at abundances below the level that can be considered as harmful to the ecosystem. In addition to a baseline database, this study highlights the potential use of certain diatom species as indicators of hydrography and water quality for monitoring dynamic coastal marine ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data  aGAP 2429cDirectorate General of Shipping, Government of India 3aCylindrotheca closterium 3aLeptocylindrus 3aMelosira 3aMiozoa 3aNitzschia 3aParalia 3aRhizosolenia 3aSkeletonema costatum 3aalgae 3acoasts 3acommunity structure 3adatabases 3aenvironmental factors 3ahydrology 3amarine ecosystems 3amonitoring 3amonsoon season 3anutrient content 3aphytoplankton 3atoxicity 3awater quality 3aIndia1 aMitbavkar, Smita1 aAnil, Arga Chandrashekar0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2018 Aug., v. 190, no. 8 p.481-481dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl33242x0167-63697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-018-6840-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01568naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002000146245007300166300001600239520064200255592002800897650001500925650001000940650001600950650001700966650002000983650002401003650002101027700001801048773009901066856008001165852000901245655001201254IND60083056120221119124735.0141101e20120201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008305612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ab.2011.11.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Chih-Hsin10aLiquid crystal-based immunoassays for detecting hepatitis B antibody  ap. 321-323.  aConventional immunoassays are often fluorescence- or enzyme-based and require additional readout systems.

Their photosynthetic productivity is largely driven by changes in light intensity and temperature at the surface of sediment flats during emersion. The impact of an increase in salinity of the upper-layer sediment pore-water during emersion, which is often coupled with high light (HL), has been less studied. Furthermore, benthic diatoms show several growth forms which inhabit specific sediment types where the pore-water salinity can differentially vary due to the degree of cohesion of sediment grains. So far, no study explored if the main growth forms of benthic diatoms (i.e. epipelon, epipsammon and tychoplankton) show different photophysiological response to a combine high salinity-HL stress. Based on field monitoring, we compared the photophysiology (photosynthetic efficiency and photoprotection) of three representatives of the main growth forms during a short high salinity coupled with a moderate HL stress and stable optimal temperature, i.e. experimental conditions reproducing Spring environmental conditions in intertidal flats by the Atlantic French coast. Our results show that all growth forms reacted to HL exposure alone, as expected. While the epipelon representative was relatively insensitive to high salinity alone and combined with HL, the tychoplankton representative was highly sensitive to both, and the epipsammon representative was sensitive mainly to the stress combination. These specific responses fitted well with i) their natural habitat (i.e. more or less cohesive sediment) for which light climate and changes in salinity are different, ii) their growth form (i.e. motile, immotile or amphibious) which determines their probability to be confronted to a combined high salinity-HL stress. Hence, the negative effect of high salinity on photosynthetic efficiency of benthic diatoms appears to be mostly restricted to epipsammon and tychoplankton, and in field conditions, its effect probably remains negligible compared to HL stress.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillariophyceae 3aadverse effects 3abiological production 3aclimate change 3acoasts 3acohesion 3aenvironmental factors 3aestuaries 3ahabitats 3alight intensity 3alittoral zone 3amonitoring 3aphotostability 3aphotosynthesis 3aprobability 3asalinity 3asediments 3asurface temperature 3atemperate zones 0aChl a 0aDD 0aDES 0aDT 0aE 0aETR 0aHL 0aLL 0aMPB 0aNPQ 0aPSII 0aRLC 0aXC 0aDiatom 0aIntertidal flat 0aMicrophytobenthos 0aPhotoprotection 0aPhotosynthesis 0aSalinity1 aBarnett, Alexandre1 aMéléder, Vona1 aDupuy, Christine1 aLavaud, Johann0 tJournal of experimental marine biology and ecology.g2015 Feb., v. 463 p.95-104dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11705x0022-09817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jembe.2014.11.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03743naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100005400145245009700199300001800296500001900314500002000333520183300353592002802186596008802214596005102302596005002353596005902403596005902462650001902521650002302540650001202563650002102575650002302596650001502619650002602634650002202660650002202682651001002704700001902714700005402733700005902787700005702846700005602903700001502959700005402974773012103028856007903149852000903228655001203237IND60733497220221120124353.0210408e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073349722DNAL7 a10.1111/1365-2745.135832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQuan, Quan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8202-685810aHigh‐level rather than low‐level warming destabilizes plant community biomass production  ap. 1607-1617.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aEcosystem stability is essential to its sustainable functions and services to humanity. Although climate warming is projected to vary from 1 to 5°C by the end of 21st century, how the temporal stability of plant community biomass production responds to different warming scenarios remains unclear. To fill this knowledge gap, we conducted a 6‐year field experiment with three levels of warming treatments (control, +1.5°C, +2.5°C) by using infrared radiators, in an alpine meadow on the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau. We found that low‐level warming (+1.5°C), compared to the control, did not significantly change the temporal stability of plant community biomass production and its underlying causes, including species diversity, compensatory dynamics, mean–variance scaling, biomass temporal stability of plant population (the average of temporal stability of species biomass production of all species in the community) or dominant species. However, high‐level warming (+2.5°C) significantly reduced them. Species diversity was not a significant predictor of temporal stability of plant community biomass production in this species‐rich ecosystem, regardless of the magnitude of warming, while co‐existing species compensatory dynamics and the biomass temporal stability of dominant species determined the response of temporal stability of plant community biomass production to warming. Synthesis. Our results suggest that the responses of plant community biomass temporal stability and its underlying mechanisms to climate warming depend on warming magnitudes. The findings highlight the various responses of ecosystem functions and services to different warming scenarios and imply that ecosystem will fail to maintain and provide stable biomass‐related services for humanity under high‐level climate warming.  aPublisher supplied data  aXDA23080302cStrategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences  aCBET‐1833988cUS National Science Foundation  aDEB‐1856318cUS National Science Foundation  a31625006cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31988102cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aalpine meadows 3abiomass production 3aclimate 3adominant species 3aecological balance 3aecosystems 3afield experimentation 3aplant communities 3aspecies diversity 3aChina1 aZhang, Fangyue1 aJiang, Lin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7114-07941 aChen, Han Y.

In fact, increasing interests have been gathered around efficient strategies to use energy sources that do not generate high CO₂ titers. Thus, science-funding agencies have invested more resources into research on hydrogen among other biofuels as interesting energy vectors. This article reviews present energy challenges and frames it into the present fuel usage landscape. Different strategies for hydrogen production are explained and evaluated. Focus is on biological hydrogen production; fermentation and photon-fuelled hydrogen production are compared. Mathematical models in biology can be used to assess, explore and design production strategies for industrially relevant metabolites, such as biofuels. We assess the diverse construction and uses of genome-scale metabolic models of cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 to efficiently obtain biofuels. This organism has been studied as a potential photon-fuelled production platform for its ability to grow from carbon dioxide, water and photons, on simple culture media. Finally, we review studies that propose production strategies to weigh this organism’s viability as a biofuel production platform.

Isotonitazene powder and purity determination was performed on the sample collected in the first death scene by NMR, HRMS, GC-FTIR, ATR-FTIR and GC–MS. Isotonitazene purity was determined by GC–MS analysis and proton NMR, and was defined to be above 95 % and 98 %, respectively.Quantification of isotonitazene in biological samples was performed using a targeted analysis based on SPE extraction and ultra-high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry.The isotonitazene median concentration in femoral whole blood was 1.20ng/mL. Isotonitazene concentration in hair was similar or even lower compared to that seen in fentanyl abusers. Isotonitazene distribution in tissues converges in the brain, lungs and heart, respectively. Surprisingly, isotonitazene concentration in liver is the lowest measured for all tissues and fluids analyzed.Based on circumstantial evidence, autopsy findings and the results of the toxicological analysis, the medical examiner concluded that the cause of all three deaths was an acute intoxication with isotonitazene.Since isotonitazene toxic concentration levels are very low, the consumption of this new psychoactive drug is a real hazard for human health.  aPublisher supplied data 3abenzimidazole 3ablood 3abrain 3adeath 3afentanyl 3aforensic sciences 3aheart 3ahuman health 3aillicit drugs 3aliver 3anecropsy 3apoisoning 3apsychotropic agents 3atoxicity 3atoxicity testing 3aultra-performance liquid chromatography 3aSwitzerland 0aNPS 0aGC 0aUHPLC 0aHRMS 0aMS 0aMS/MS 0aToF 0aMRM 0aESI 0aSLE 0aSPE 0aCX 0aLLOQ 0aLOQ 0aLOD 0aULOQ 0aTHC 0aEDTA 0aMOR 0aFTIR 0aNMR 0aAPCI 0aDQF-COSY 0aedHSQC 0aHMBC 0aNOE 0aIsotonitazene quantification 0aHuman tissues post-mortem redistribution 0aNew psychoactive substances 0aLC-MS/MS 0aHair1 aBogdal, C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9137-86631 aPfeiffer, B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6209-07051 aAndrello, L.1 aCeschi, A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4308-04051 aThomas, A.1 aGrata, E.0 tForensic science international.g2021 Mar., v. 320 p.110686-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:3523x0379-07387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.forsciint.2021.1106863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02290naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001600155245011000171300001600281520089500297592002801192650000901220650001501229650001401244650002501258650001501283650001101298650000801309650002601317650001401343650001401357650001801371650001201389650001501401653003301416653000701449653000701456653000701463653000701470653000701477653000701484653000801491653001301499653001301512653001001525653002001535700002901555773007801584856008901662852000901751655001201760IND60569042020221119164858.0170709e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056904202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2017.05.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFilella, M.10aLess-studied TCE: are their environmental concentrations increasing due to their use in new technologies?  ap. 605-616.  aThe possible environmental impact of the recent increase in use of a group of technology-critical elements (Nb, Ta, Ga, In, Ge and Te) is analysed by reviewing published concentration profiles in environmental archives (ice cores, ombrotrophic peat bogs, freshwater sediments and moss surveys) and evaluating temporal trends in surface waters. No increase has so far been recorded. The low potential direct emissions of these elements, resulting from their absolute low production levels, make it unlikely that the increasing use of these elements in modern technology has any noticeable effect on their environmental concentrations on a global scale. This holds particularly true for those of these elements that are probably emitted in relatively high amounts from other human activities (i.e., coal combustion and non-ferrous smelting), such as In, the most studied element of the group.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoal 3acombustion 3aemissions 3aenvironmental impact 3afreshwater 3ahumans 3aice 3amosses and liverworts 3apeatlands 3asediments 3asurface water 3asurveys 3atechnology 0aTechnology-critical elements 0aGa 0aGe 0aIn 0aNb 0aTa 0aTe 0aIce 0aSediment 0aPeat bog 0aWater 0aTemporal trends1 aRodríguez-Murillo, J.C.0 tChemosphere.g2017 Sept., v. 182 p.605-616dElsevier Ltdx0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2017.05.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04030naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245015100171300001400322500001500336520240800351592002802759650001602787650002202803650001302825650001802838650002002856650000902876650002602885650001402911650001102925650001302936650001902949650001502968650003102983650001103014651001403025653002303039653002103062653002103083653002303104653002803127653001003155700001803165700002403183700001903207700001803226700002103244773013003265856008403395852000903479655001203488IND60539643420221119020435.0190318e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053964342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jembe.2014.11.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSommerfeld, Julia10aFlexible foraging behaviour in a marine predator, the Masked booby (Sula dactylatra), according to foraging locations and environmental conditions  ap. 79-86.  a2019-12-06  aFlexible foraging behaviour allows marine predators to exploit shifting prey diversity and adjust to spatio-temporal changes in the distribution of prey. In diving marine predators, the number of dives within a dive bout, distances between dives in a bout and distances between bouts have been related to prey patch size, density of prey patches and prey encounter rates, respectively. In addition, the predictability of prey encounters can be examined by studying individuals' foraging site fidelity. Based on this, we examined in chick-rearing Masked boobies (Sula dactylatra) from Phillip Island (South-west Pacific), Australia, using GPS and depth–acceleration data logger, how these parameters changed over time (two early breeding phases and one late phase over two years) and according to foraging locations and environmental conditions. Results revealed that birds foraged in two distinct areas: over a nearby shallow shelf (“local area”) and over distant deeper waters (“distant area”). Birds searched for prey in the distant area only during the two latest study periods, indicating less favourable foraging conditions within the local area during this time, although persistent higher chlorophyll-a concentrations in the local area were indicative of an upwelling. Our data suggest that birds experienced a trade-off between local and distant trips: although the strong foraging site fidelity within the local area suggests that prey encounters were predictable, smaller dive bouts indicated smaller prey patches, i.e. less prey nearby the colony during the two latest study periods. As a consequence, adults undertook distant trips to forage in larger prey patches, as inferred from larger dive bouts, but distances between these dive bouts were more variable and birds showed no foraging site fidelity, indicating less predictable prey encounters. Local trips presumably allow a high feeding frequency of the chick, while distant trips allow adults to replenish their own body reserves. Observed changes in foraging conditions, although the underlying causes were not determined, appear to be within the eco-physiological limitations of Masked boobies. However, further studies are required to determine the degree of this limitation, especially as changes in the spatio-temporal availability of prey can be expected to increase with global warming and changing oceanic processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3achlorophyll 3afeeding frequency 3abreeding 3aecophysiology 3amicroprocessors 3aSula 3aenvironmental factors 3apredators 3aadults 3aforaging 3aglobal warming 3aphilopatry 3aglobal positioning systems 3achicks 3aAustralia 0aForaging movements 0aDiving behaviour 0aMarine predators 0aSouth-west Pacific 0aBehavioural flexibility 0abirds1 aKatō, Akiko,1 aRopert-Coudert, Yan1 aGarthe, Stefan1 aWilcox, Chris1 aHindell, Mark A.0 tJournal of experimental marine biology and ecology.g2015 Feb., v. 463 p.79-86dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11705x0022-09817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jembe.2014.11.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02820naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006100150245014500211300001800356500001900374520147400393592002801867650002501895650001601920650001701936650002101953650002201974650001301996650002402009650002302033650002002056650001502076700001502091700005002106700005702156773012802213856008402341852000902425655001202434IND60728012420221119150208.0210216e20210203xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072801242DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.0c042932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalovska, Barbora1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7093-457610aBoxCarmax: A High-Selectivity Data-Independent Acquisition Mass Spectrometry Method for the Analysis of Protein Turnover and Complex Samples  ap. 3103-3111.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe data-independent acquisition (DIA) performed in the latest high-resolution, high-speed mass spectrometers offers a powerful analytical tool for biological investigations. The DIA mass spectrometry (DIA-MS) combined with the isotopic labeling approach holds a particular promise for increasing the multiplexity of DIA-MS analysis, which could assist the relative protein quantification and the proteome-wide turnover profiling. However, the wide MS1 isolation windows employed in conventional DIA methods lead to a limited efficiency in identifying and quantifying isotope-labeled peptide pairs through peptide fragment ions. Here, we optimized a high-selectivity DIA-MS named BoxCarmax that supports the analysis of complex samples, such as those generated from Stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) and pulse SILAC (pSILAC) experiments. BoxCarmax enables multiplexed acquisition at both MS1 and MS2 levels, through the integration of BoxCar and MSX features, as well as a gas-phase separation strategy. We found BoxCarmax significantly improved the quantitative accuracy in SILAC and pSILAC samples by mitigating the ratio suppression of isotope–peptide pairs. We further applied BoxCarmax to measure protein degradation regulation during serum starvation stress in cultured cells, revealing valuable biological insights. Our study offered an alternative and accurate approach for the MS analysis of protein turnover and complex samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical chemistry 3ablood serum 3acell culture 3aisotope labeling 3amass spectrometry 3apeptides 3aprotein degradation 3aprotein metabolism 3astable isotopes 3astarvation1 aLi, Wenxue1 aDi, Yi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6768-70761 aLiu, Yansheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2626-39120 tAnalytical chemistry.g2021 Feb. 03, v. 93, no. 6 p.3103-3111dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.0c042933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03100naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245009900169300001600268520131700284592002801601650001101629650002001640650001401660650001301674650001901687650001101706650001601717650001201733650001201745650001801757650001201775650001401787650001101801650001401812650001201826650001001838650002301848650001001871650001101881650003501892650002601927650001501953650001601968650001401984653001101998653002202009653002302031653002002054653001602074700001802090700001402108700002002122700001802142700001902160700001802179700002102197700001602218773010902234856008602343852000902429655001202438IND60635143820221122052545.0190425e20190627xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063514382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2019.03.0382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXie, Kai-Dong10aCitrus triploid recovery based on 2x × 4x crosses via an optimized embryo rescue approach  ap. 104-109.  aSeedlessness is a primary breeding objective for citrus fresh fruit market, and triploids have been proven to have great value to produce seedless fruits. In this study, aiming to produce triploid plants for developing some seedless cultivars, four 2x × 4x interploid crosses were conducted using three elite but seedy cultivars as seed parents and one newly flowered doubled diploid and two allotetraploid somatic hybrids as pollen parents. As a result, a total of 1454 developed and 3409 undeveloped seeds from 341 fruits were obtained. Using an optimized embryo rescue approach, 669 developed and 1301 undeveloped seeds germinated in vitro, with an average germination rate as 52.5% for the crosses using ‘Nadorcott’ tangor and ‘Bendizao’ tangerine (polyembryonic) as seed parents and 31.0% for the crosses using ‘Orah’ mandarin (monoembryonic) as seed parent. Then by shoot and root induction, totally 1354 plantlets were regenerated, among which 401 and 54 plants were proved to be triploids and tetraploids by flow cytometry (FCM) analysis and chromosome counting. Hybrid nature of the selected triploid progenies, as well as two different origins (doubled diploid and hybrid origins) for the selected tetraploid progenies was further confirmed by single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCitrus 3aallotetraploidy 3acultivars 3adiploidy 3aflow cytometry 3afruits 3agermination 3ahybrids 3amarkets 3aovule culture 3aparents 3aplantlets 3apollen 3araw fruit 3arooting 3aroots 3aseedless varieties 3aseeds 3ashoots 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3asomatic hybridization 3atangerines 3atetraploidy 3atriploidy 0aCitrus 0aSeedless breeding 0aInterploid crosses 0aPloidy analysis 0aSNP markers1 aYuan, Dong-Ya1 aWang, Wei1 aXia, Qiang-Ming1 aWu, Xiao-Meng1 aChen, Chuan-Wu1 aChen, Chun-Li1 aGrosser, Jude W.1 aGuo, Wen-Wu0 tScientia horticulturae.g2019 June 27, v. 252 p.104-109dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4108x0304-42387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2019.03.0383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03639naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006100140245008300201300001800284500002000302520232300322592002802645650002002673650002702693650002202720650002002742650001502762650002402777650002502801650000902826650001202835650002502847650001602872650002402888651001702912700002602929700002002955700002502975773013303000856007503133852000903208655001203217IND60787172520221119095101.0220808e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078717252DNAL7 a10.1002/jwmg.219182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMessmer, David J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6058-000610aIntegrated Population Modeling for White‐Tailed Deer in Saskatchewan, Canada  ap. 1224-1233.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aMonitoring annual change and long‐term trends in population structure and abundance of white‐tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) is an important but challenging component of their management. Many monitoring programs consist of count‐based indices of relative abundance along with a variety of population structure information. Analyzed separately these data can be difficult to interpret because of observation error in the data collection process, missing data, and the lack of an explicit biological model to connect the data streams while accounting for their relative imprecision. We used a Bayesian age‐structured integrated population model to integrate data from a fall spotlight survey that produced a count‐based index of relative abundance and a volunteer staff and citizen classification survey that generated a fall recruitment index. Both surveys took place from 2003–2018 in the parkland ecoregion of southeast Saskatchewan, Canada. Our approach modeled demographic processes for age‐specific (0.5‐, 1.5‐, ≥2.5‐year‐old classes) populations and was fit to count and recruitment data via models that allowed for error in the respective observation processes. The Bayesian framework accommodated missing data and allowed aggregation of transects to act as samples from the larger management unit population. The approach provides managers with continuous time series of estimated relative abundance, recruitment rates, and apparent survival rates with full propagation of uncertainty and sharing of information among transects. We used this model to demonstrate winter severity effects on recruitment rates via an interaction between winter snow depth and minimum temperatures. In years with colder than average temperatures and above average snow depth, recruitment was depressed, whereas the negative effect of snow depth reversed in years with above average temperatures. This and other covariate information can be incorporated into the model to test relationships and provide predictions of future population change prior to setting of hunting seasons. Likewise, post hoc analysis of model output allows other hypothesis tests, such as determining the statistical support for whether population status has crossed a management trigger threshold. © 2020 The Wildlife Society.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aOdocoileus virginianus 3abiological models 3adata collection 3aecoregions 3apopulation dynamics 3apopulation structure 3asnow 3asurveys 3atime series analysis 3auncertainty 3awildlife management 3aSaskatchewan1 aHenderson, Allison E.1 aWhiklo, Todd M.1 aConkin, Katherine R.0 tjournal of wildlife management.g2020 Sept., v. 84, no. 7 p.1224-1233dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl46144x0022-541X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jwmg.219183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02739naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006500147245011500212300001200327520113700339592002801476650001101504650001901515650001701534650002301551650002301574650001201597650002701609650002101636650001101657650002001668650001701688650001101705650000901716650001101725650001701736650000901753650001501762650000901777651001301786700001801799700002301817700002201840700002101862700002001883700002201903700001801925773015101943856008202094961001202176852000902188655001202197IND60606193520221121190729.0181002e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060619352DNAL7 a10.1007/s10661-018-6844-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReboredo, Fernando H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3906-434910aHeavy metal content of edible plants collected close to an area of intense mining activity (southern Portugal)  ap. 484.  aThe Neves-Corvo mining complex (MC) situated in southern Portugal exploits one of the most world’s important copper deposits. Agricultural soils surrounding the MC, used by the inhabitants for crop production, contain excessive amounts of As, Cu, Pb, and Zn. Thus, a potential risk to human consumption exists if edible plants grow on these substrata. Arsenic and Pb were not detected in edible samples collected near the MC and 5 km away, but in the leaves—structural or adsorbed onto the surface. In general, Zn was the most mobile element in both contaminated and reference areas as seen by the bioaccumulation factors (BAF). The tolerable upper intake (TUI) values for Cu are a reason of concern, since in 57.1% of the cases, the TUI values are above the recommended upper limit of 5 mg/day, in the case of Ficus carica, Cucurbita pepo, and Phaseolus vulgaris, whereas in 28.6% of the cases, the TUI values are near this limit (C. pepo and Citrus x sinensis). The consumption of such vegetables from these areas must be banned or strongly reduced, since long-term accumulation of Cu can cause a chronic toxicity in humans.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCitrus 3aCucurbita pepo 3aFicus carica 3aPhaseolus vulgaris 3aagricultural soils 3aarsenic 3abioaccumulation factor 3achronic toxicity 3acopper 3acrop production 3aheavy metals 3ahumans 3alead 3amining 3aplant growth 3arisk 3avegetables 3azinc 3aPortugal1 aPelica, João1 aLidon, Fernando C.1 aRamalho, José C.1 aPessoa, Maria F.1 aCalvão, Teresa1 aSimões, Manuela,1 aGuerra, Mauro0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2018 Aug., v. 190, no. 8 p.484-484dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl33242x0167-63697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-018-6844-73Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/DA  aDNAL 7aarticle01336naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245008900158300001800247520042800265592002800693650002100721650002600742650001100768650001500779650001300794700001700807700002100824773010500845856007500950852000901025655001201034IND60578667820221119143255.0170813e20130405xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057866782DNAL7 a10.1021/ol400411v2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYadav, M.

The results indicate that, in addition to the excellent shape memory effect, the SMPU nanofibrous nonwovens show excellent liquid transfer properties and water vapor transport properties. Moreover, the WVP of a SMPU nanofibrous nonwoven is sensitive to the change of relative humidity (RH) and temperature. For example, the WVP decreases with the increase of RH above a critical RH, e.g. 50%, and increases significantly with the increase of temperature below a turnover temperature, e.g. 50°C. The diameter of the nanofiber has little influence on the WVP while the turnover temperature is higher in SMPU nanofibrous nonwovens with larger diameters. Finally, SEM images at a higher temperature suggest that the porous nanofibrous nonwoven structure is the foundation of unique WVP properties, and the collapse of the nanofiber at the higher temperature results in the abrupt decrease in WVP.  aPublisher supplied data 3aliquids 3ananofibers 3anonwoven fabrics 3apermeability 3apolyurethanes 3arelative humidity 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atemperature 3atextile fibers 3awater vapor 0aShape memory 0awater vapor permeability 0ananofiber 0anonwoven 0acollapse1 aJinlian Hu, 1 aShaojun Chen, 0 tTextile research journal.g2011 June, v. 81, no. 9 p.883-891dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl46536x0040-51757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00405175103924693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03083naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245012300167300001400290520171200304592002802016650001502044650001302059650001502072650001802087650002002105650002602125650000902151650003302160650002002193651001402213653001802227653001902245653001402264653001202278700002102290700002402311700002002335700002802355700002502383700002602408773010002434856008202534852000902616655001202625IND60777161320221119105947.0220719e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077716132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcz.2022.05.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAkmal, Yusrizal10aSpecies authentication of Tor spp. (family Cyprinidae) in Indonesia based on osteocranium structure and biometric data  ap. 21-30.  aCurrently, the existence of Tor species is threatened with extinction and is listed on the IUCN red list due to overfishing, forest destruction, water pollution, fluctuations in water volume, and land conversion. This study aims to fully describe the differences in the osteocranium structure of four Tor species (T. tambroides, T. douronensis, T. tambra, and T. soro) in Indonesia. Visually, the genus Tor is identified by the presence of a lobe on the ventral side of the lower lip. T. tambroides has long and thick lobes, T. tambra has short lobes, T. douronensis has long and thin lobes, while T. soro has very short lobes. The results of the osteocranium structure analysis of four Tor species showed differences, including the occipital, lateral ethmoid, frontal, infraorbital, nasal, preethmoid, prootic, pterotic, vomer, lateral ethmoid processus, pterotic processus, and lateral processus bones, where the differences in the osteocranium structure include the size, number, and development of the bone. The results of the univariate analysis (analysis of variance) of 33 characters of biometric data showed that 20 characters were significantly different (P < 0.05) and the other 13 characters were not significantly different (P > 0.05). Furthermore, the results of multivariate analysis (principal component analysis) of 33 biometric data characters succeeded in discriminating four Tor species into four separate groups; however, T. tambroides and T. douronensis tended to be more closely related than the other two species. In conclusion, this study shows that osteocranium structure and biometric analysis have successfully authenticated four Tor species into four separate groups validly.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCyprinidae 3abiometry 3aextinction 3aforest damage 3aland use change 3amultivariate analysis 3anose 3aprincipal component analysis 3awater pollution 3aIndonesia 0aT. tambroides 0aT. douronensis 0aT. tambra 0aT. soro1 aMuliari, Muliari1 aHumairani, Rindhira1 aZulfahmi, Ilham1 aBurhanuddin, Andi Iqbal1 aBudimawan, Budimawan1 aBatubara, Agung Setia0 tZoologischer Anzeiger.g2022 July, v. 299 p.21-30dElsevier GmbHwJournal:6280x0044-52317nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcz.2022.05.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02593naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001400164245010900178300001600287500001500303520097300318592002801291650002801319650002301347650001301370650002501383650002901408650001001437650001201447650002401459650003801483650003701521650003801558650003601596650002801632650002301660650002301683650002701706650003401733650003101767653002301798700001401821700001301835700001701848700001901865773010001884852000901984856008201993655001202075IND4417398820221119214354.0190430e200904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441739882DNAL7 a191302002pmid7 a10.1007/s11262-008-0320-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Hong10aTranscriptional suppression of IE180 and TK promoters by the EP0 of pseudorabies virus strains Ea and Fa  ap. 269-275.  a2019-12-06  aIn our transient expression assays, the IE180 and TK promoters were markedly suppressed by the EP0 of the pseudorabies virus strains Ea and Fa (EP0/Ea, EP0/Fa). This is in contrast with the transactivating activity of EP0 from strain YS-81 (EP0/YS-81) in previous studies. Amino acid sequence alignment revealed several mutations in both EP0/Ea and EP0/Fa compared with EP0/YS-81. Most remarkable is a two-amino acid substitution next to the RING finger domain which was considered to be important for the transactivating activity of EP0 in previous studies. To address the effect of the two-amino acid substitution on the function of EP0, reverse mutants of EP0/Ea and EP0/Fa were generated. The subsequent expression assays indicated that this substitution was at least in part responsible for the effect on the regulatory activity of EP0. Our data suggested that EP0 may regulate the expression of the same genes in different pseudorabies virus strains differently.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSuid alphaherpesvirus 1 3asequence alignment 3amutation 3aamino acid sequences 3atranscription (genetics) 3agenes 3amutants 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAmino Acid Substitutionxgenetics 2aDNA, Viralxchemistryxgenetics. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Viral 2aHerpesvirus 1, Suidxphysiology 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutation, Missense 2aSequence Alignment 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aViral Proteinsxmetabolism 0aSuid herpesvirus 11 aZhou, Rui1 aXi, Yang1 aXiao, Shaobo1 aChen, Huanchun0 tVirus genes.g2009 Apr., v. 38, no. 2 p.269-275dSpringer USwJournal:jnl53274x0920-85697nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11262-008-0320-33Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02676naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002500139245013900164300001800303500002000321520135400341592002801695650002901723650003101752650001001783650001401793650001401807650001201821650001801833650002701851650003501878700002401913700002001937700001901957700002501976700002302001700002002024700002602044773010202070856007302172852000902245655001202254IND60587315220221119110602.0171217e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058731522DNAL7 a10.1111/mec.143862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBlackburn, Gwylim S.10aDistinct sources of gene flow produce contrasting population genetic dynamics at different range boundaries of a Choristoneura budworm  ap. 6666-6684.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aPopulations are often exposed to multiple sources of gene flow, but accounts are lacking of the population genetic dynamics that result from these interactions or their effects on local evolution. Using a genomic clines framework applied to 1,195 single nucleotide polymorphisms, we documented genomewide, locus‐specific patterns of introgression between Choristoneura occidentalis biennis spruce budworms and two ecologically divergent relatives, C. o. occidentalis and Choristoneura fumiferana, that it interacts with at alternate boundaries of its range. We observe contrasting hybrid indexes between the two hybrid zones, no overlap in “gene‐flow outliers” (clines showing relatively extreme extents or rates of locus‐specific introgression) and variable linkage disequilibrium among those outliers. At the same time, correlated genomewide rates of introgression between zones suggest the presence of processes common to both boundaries. These findings highlight the contrasting population genetic dynamics that can occur at separate frontiers of a single population, while also suggesting that shared patterns may frequently accompany cases of divergence‐with‐gene‐flow that involve a lineage in common. Our results point to potentially complex evolutionary outcomes for populations experiencing multiple sources of gene flow.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChoristoneura fumiferana 3aChoristoneura occidentalis 3aPicea 3aevolution 3agene flow 3ahybrids 3aintrogression 3alinkage disequilibrium 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism1 aBrunet, Bryan M.

However, the underlying mechanisms of kin discrimination are assumed to vary between species and—within species—between contexts. During solitary life stages, kin recognition based on social learning is assumed to be less reliable because kin templates that are not continuously updated may get lost. Therefore, self-referent phenotype matching (“armpit effect”), i.e., the comparison of unknown phenotypes with own characteristics, should be particularly relevant when no social cues are available. However, experimental evidence for this mechanism is scarce. Here, we examine self-referent kin recognition in a mate-choice context in adult male Pelvicachromis taeniatus, a socially monogamous cichlid fish from West Africa with biparental brood care and pronounced kin-mating preferences. Juvenile P. taeniatus live in groups, whereas adult males compete for access to breeding sites which they aggressively defend against rivals. Using computer-animated females as standardized visual stimuli in combination with olfactory cues of related and unrelated females, we show that adult males reared isolated from kin since egg stage were able to discriminate sisters from unrelated females. As males could have learned kin cues only from themselves, our study provides evidence for self-referent kin recognition and indicates that the observed inbreeding preferences are mediated by self-derived olfactory cues. Male preferences for sisters were correlated with male body size. We discuss the implications of quality-related mate choice for the evolution of kin-mating preferences.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCichlidae 3aadults 3abody size 3abreeding sites 3abrood rearing 3aeggs 3aevolution 3afemales 3ainbreeding 3akin recognition 3alearning 3amales 3aphenotype 3asisters 3aWestern Africa1 aBakker, Theo C.

This is particularly pertinent under neutral to mildly alkaline conditions typically required for alkylation of thiols. Here we describe the synthesis and properties of a thiol-specific reagent, fluorescent cyclic activated disulfide (FCAD), which includes the fluorescein moiety as fluorophore and utilizes a variation of thiol-disulfide exchange chemistry. The leaving-group character of FCAD makes it reactive at pH 3, allowing modification at low pH, limiting thiol-disulfide exchange. Different applications are demonstrated including picomolar thiol detection, determination of redox potentials, and in-gel detection of labeled proteins.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkylation 3afluorescein 3afluorescence 3apH 3aproteins 3aredox potential 3athiols1 aJensen, Kristine Steen1 aHansen, Rosa E.1 aGotfredsen, Charlotte H.1 aWinther, Jakob R.0 tAnalytical biochemistry.g2012 Feb. 1, v. 421, no. 1 p.115-120dElsevier Inc.x0003-26977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ab.2011.11.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02048naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002300153245009200176520100600268592002801274653001001302653002201312653001801334653002201352653000901374700001901383700001801402700002501420700002101445700001801466700002301484773010601507856008801613852000901701655001201710IND60672141520221122040718.0200106e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067214152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.marpolbul.2019.1106482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarcia-Garin, Odei10aBoops boops as a bioindicator of microplastic pollution along the Spanish Catalan coast  aMicroplastic pollution is a growing cause of concern for the marine environment, particularly in the Mediterranean Sea, which is considered to be one of the most polluted seas worldwide. In this study, the gastrointestinal tracts of 102 bogues (Boops boops), sampled from three areas off the Catalan coast (Spain) subject to different degrees of industrialization, were analysed to assess microplastic ingestion and thus estimate local levels of microplastic pollution. Microplastics were detected in 46% of samples analysed. As expected, the abundance and frequency of occurrence of ingested microplastics were higher off the most anthropized area of Barcelona. The majority of ingested microplastics were blue fragments ranging 0.1–0.5 mm, and the most common polymer type was polypropylene. The results of this study indicate the area off Barcelona as a possible area of concentration for microplastics, further supporting the use of B. boops as a bioindicator to assess microplastic pollution.  aPublisher supplied data 0aBogue 0aIndicator species 0aMarine litter 0aMediterranean Sea 0aFish1 aVighi, Morgana1 aAguilar, Alex1 aTsangaris, Catherine1 aDigka, Nikoletta1 aKaberi, Helen1 aBorrell, Asunción0 tMarine pollution bulletin.g2019 Dec., v. 149 p.110648-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12420x0025-326X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2019.1106483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02187naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002000146245009000166300001600256520104300272592002801315650001401343650001801357650001901375650001201394650001801406650001001424653001501434653002401449653001601473653001001489653001601499653001201515653000901527700002901536700001601565773011901581856008001700852000901780655001201789IND60616609020221121162312.0181018e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061660902DNAL7 a10.1177/00405175103924712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiaogang Chen, 13aAn overview on fabrication of three-dimensional woven textile preforms for composites  ap. 932-944.  aThere are various manufacturing processes for the interlacement of yarns to produce three-dimensional (3D) fabric structures as preforms for textile composites. The manufacturing route is determined by the end-use of composites and therefore the composite industry does not solely rely on one method but a selection of methods for fabric formation. This paper attempts to make a comprehensive overview on fabrication methods that can be used for making 3D textile woven preforms for composites. There are many different views on what 3D woven fabrics are, but one common understanding is that 3D fabrics must have substantial dimension in the thickness direction formed by layers of fabrics or yarns. In this paper we classify 3D woven textiles into those that can be manufactured on the conventional weaving technology and those that require specially made weaving machines/devices. This paper attempts to provide useful information for both the textile and composite engineers in developing textile composites for advanced applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aequipment 3amanufacturing 3atextile fibers 3aweaving 3awoven fabrics 3ayarns 0aComposites 0a3D fabric formation 0afabrication 0afibre 0amanufacture 0aweaving 0ayarn1 aTaylor, Lindsay Waterton1 aTsai, Li-Ju0 tTextile research journal.g2011 June, v. 81, no. 9 p.932-944dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl46536x0040-51757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00405175103924713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02150naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245010000170520108800270592002801358653003201386653001801418653001701436653001001453653000901463700002201472700002201494700002801516700002401544700001901568700002201587773010601609856008801715852000901803655001201812IND60672141620221122040735.0200106e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067214162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.marpolbul.2019.1106492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVelez, Nadja12aA baseline assessment of beach macrolitter and microplastics along northeastern Atlantic shores  aMarine litter is widely dispersed throughout coastal environments.

This study presents a baseline for the monitoring of litter and microplastics in intertidal sediments along the Atlantic shores of southern Portugal and Morocco and identifies potential sources of contamination. Although variable, distribution and composition of both litter and microplastics did not follow a latitudinal pattern. Most of the litter had an undifferentiated source. Within the identifiable sources of litter, food packaging, fishing and tobacco were the most abundant, with variable contributions among sites. Over 97% of marine litter retrieved was plastic. Fragments and filaments were the most abundant categories of plastics at sites with the highest and lowest microplastic abundance respectively. Filaments were mainly made of Polypropylene (PP,50%) and Polyethylene terephthalate (PET,29%) while the predominant polymers for fragments were Polyethene (PE, 75%) and PP (25%).  aPublisher supplied data 0aMarine anthropogenic debris 0aMarine litter 0aMicroplastic 0aRaman 0aFTIR1 aZardi, Gerardo I.1 aLo Savio, Roberto1 aMcQuaid, Christopher D.1 aValbusa, U.q(Ugo),1 aSabour, Brahim1 aNicastro, Katy R.0 tMarine pollution bulletin.g2019 Dec., v. 149 p.110649-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12420x0025-326X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2019.1106493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01576naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100001900180245007400199300001800273506007600291520043700367592002800804506003700832650001000869650001400879650001200893650001400905650002300919650002300942650002300965650000700988700001800995773010501013856007501118852000901193655001201202IND60578668120221207111728.0170813e20130405xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057866812DNAL7 a10.1021/ol400427x2doi7 aPMC36187162pmcid7 a234777192pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCrisalli, Pete10aImportance of ortho Proton Donors in Catalysis of Hydrazone Formation  ap. 1646-1649.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAnthranilic acids were recently reported as superior catalysts for hydrazone and oxime formation compared to aniline, the classic catalyst for these reactions.

Py-GC/MS/FID method was used to evaluate the contents of the main products. Lignocelluloses were found to be a more promising precursor to obtain levoglucosenone with lesser content of furfural: For birch wood and lignocelluloses hydrothermally treated at 150 and 180 °C, Py-GC/MS/FID revealed levoglucosenone yields of 12.83, 16.94 and 21.08%, correspondingly (at 5% phosphoric acid addition). When birch wood impregnated with 5% H₃PO₄ was pyrolized in the laboratory screw-type reactor, the levoglucosenone yield was 6.5%. The composition and content of volatiles formed in analytical pyrolysis, bio-oil and its chloroform extract were compared. Extraction of bio-oil with chloroform and consequent distillation resulted in fractions containing 79.14% of levoglucosenone.  aPublisher supplied data  a1.1.1.1/16/A/010.cEuropean Regional Development Fund 3aBetula 3abiofuels 3acatalytic activity 3achloroform 3adistillation 3afurfural 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3ahot water treatment 3alignocellulose 3aphosphoric acid 3apyrolysis 3awood 3awood impregnation1 aZhurinsh, Aivars1 aVolperts, Aleksandrs1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1246-15471 aJurkjane, Vilhelmine1 aPomilovskis, Ralfs1 aMeile, Kristine0 tWood science and technology.g2020 Mar., v. 54, no. 2 p.383-400dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl45947x0043-77197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00226-020-01164-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02730naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245010000159300001800259500001900277500002000296520125800316592002801574650001501602650001601617650001201633650001601645650001601661650001201677650000901689650001701698650001701715650002401732650001201756650001601768650001401784650001601798650000901814650000701823650001301830650002201843700005701865700002101922700006101943773014902004856007402153852000902227655001202236IND60733497820221120113951.0210408e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073349782DNAL7 a10.1002/jsfa.109172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSantra, Kalyan14aThe degradation of chlorophyll pigments in dairy silage: the timeline of anaerobic fermentation  ap. 2863-2868.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: Detection of chlorophyll metabolites in milk has recently been suggested to be an indicator of a grass‐fed diet fed for cattle. Such a means of detection, however, is complicated when the grazing season is over because cattle can be fed fermented silage ingredients, such as alfalfa and corn silage. During fermentation, chlorophyll compounds and other pigments undergo degradation due to the accumulation of lactic acid and the resultant decline in pH. RESULTS: We monitored degradation of chlorophyll compounds by measuring the fluorescence and absorption spectra of silage extracts. The spectroscopic evidence supports the hypothesis that chlorophylls are converted into fluorescent products, such as pheophytin, and further cleaved into pheophorbide. The degradation starts with dechelation and removal of the magnesium ion to produce pheophytin. Further removal of the phytol chain from pheophytin results in the production of pheophorbide. CONCLUSIONS: The fluorescence intensity of these degradation products is reduced compared to that of the parent molecule. These findings are important in understanding the fluorescent signal in milk when cows consume silage rather than fresh pasture grass. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aagriculture 3aalfalfa 3achlorophyll 3acorn silage 3adecline 3adiet 3afermentation 3afluorescence 3agrass-fed livestock 3agrasses 3alactic acid 3amagnesium 3ametabolites 3amilk 3apH 3apastures 3aspectral analysis1 aSong, Anthony1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0935-509X1 aPetrich, Jacob W1 aRasmussen, Mark A1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8584-19460 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2021 May, v. 101, no. 7 p.2863-2868dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.wJournal:jnl48536x0022-51427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.109173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03106naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245013500167300001600302520154900318536012901867592002801996650001502024650001402039650001002053650001102063650002302074650000902097650000902106650001502115650001202130650002102142650001002163650002002173650001002193650001402203651001002217653001902227653002002246653002302266653001502289653002402304700001802328700001802346700001602364773012502380856008602505852000902591655001202600IND60759864720221123034213.0220910e20210101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075986472DNAL7 a10.1080/24750263.2021.18727212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMariani, F.10aDevelopment and reproduction of Cataclysta lemnata, a potential natural enemy of the invasive alien duckweed Lemna minuta in Italy  ap. 216-225.  aLife cycle of the aquatic moth Cataclysta lemnata (Lepidoptera: Crambidae) was studied in laboratory conditions to obtain a basic biological knowledge useful for predicting the possible success of the herbivorous larvae of this insect as potential control agents in limiting the spread of the invasive American duckweed Lemna minuta (Alismatales: Araceae) in Italy. The multivoltinism of C. lemnata, as well as the high overall emergence from the pupal stage (85%), the high success in mating among the formed couples (>90%), and the high number of larvae born from each egg laying (on average 310 individuals), suggest that the insect can be successfully bred in the laboratory for the purposes of an augmentative biological control. Under experimental conditions, larvae developed in 23 days (through six larval instars, distinguishable by cephalic capsule dimensions) and pupae in 10, with no difference in duration between females and males. The larval phase resulted longer than the adult one (23 vs 10 days); therefore, it can be considered the most suitable stage for releasing the insect in the field for biocontrol purposes. Indeed, the larvae having a herbivorous diet might consume a large amount of the invasive plant, contrarily to the adult phase which is focused exclusively on reproduction. Our results not only contribute to the knowledge of aquatic Lepidoptera that are scarcely known, but also support the effectiveness of a possible protocol for an augmentative biological control of the invasive alien duckweed L. minuta.  aThis research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCataclysta 3aCrambidae 3aLemna 3aadults 3abiological control 3adiet 3aeggs 3aherbivores 3ainstars 3ainvasive species 3amoths 3anatural enemies 3apupae 3avoltinism 3aItaly 0aAquatic larvae 0aweed biocontrol 0aherbivorous insect 0alife cycle 0ainvasive macrophyte1 aFattorini, S.1 aDi Giulio, A.1 aCeschin, S.0 tThe European zoological journal.g2021 Jan. 01, v. 88, no. 1 p.216-225dTaylor & FranciswJournal:27397x2475-02637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/24750263.2021.18727213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03122naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001900146245010000165300001600265520157500281592002801856650001601884650001901900650001301919650001501932650002301947650000901970650001501979650001401994650000902008650002202017650002302039653001902062653003202081653002202113653002402135653002802159700001502187700002202202700002202224700002302246700001902269700002002288700002102308700002002329700001802349700002202367773011302389856008102502852000902583655001202592IND60623974720221121093456.0181204e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062397472DNAL7 a10.1177/00236772177188632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZintzsch, Anne10aGuidelines on severity assessment and classification of genetically altered mouse and rat lines  ap. 573-582.  aGenetic alterations can unpredictably compromise the wellbeing of animals. Thus, more or less harmful phenotypes might appear in the animals used in research projects even when they are not subjected to experimental treatments. The severity classification of suffering has become an important issue since the implementation of Directive 2010/63/EU on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes. Accordingly, the breeding and maintenance of genetically altered (GA) animals which are likely to develop a harmful phenotype has to be authorized. However, a determination of the degree of severity is rather challenging due to the large variety of phenotypes. Here, the Working Group of Berlin Animal Welfare Officers (WG Berlin AWO) provides field-tested guidelines on severity assessment and classification of GA rodents. With a focus on basic welfare assessment and severity classification we provide a list of symptoms that have been classified as non-harmful, mild, moderate or severe burdens. Corresponding monitoring and refinement strategies as well as specific housing requirements have been compiled and are strongly recommended to improve hitherto applied breeding procedures and conditions. The document serves as a guide to determine the degree of severity for an observed phenotype. The aim is to support scientists, animal care takers, animal welfare bodies and competent authorities with this task, and thereby make an important contribution to a European harmonization of severity assessments for the continually increasing number of GA rodents.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal care 3aanimal welfare 3abreeding 3aguidelines 3alaboratory animals 3amice 3amonitoring 3aphenotype 3arats 3aresearch projects 3awelfare assessment 0aanimal welfare 0agenetically altered animals 0aharmful phenotype 0aseverity assessment 0aseverity classification1 aNoe, Elena1 aReißmann, Monika1 aUllmann, Kristina1 aKramer, Stephanie,1 aJerchow, Boris1 aKluge, Reinhart1 aGösele, Claudia1 aNickles, Hannah1 aPuppe, Astrid1 aRülicke, Thomas,0 tLaboratory animals.g2017 Dec., v. 51, no. 6 p.573-582dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl45492x1758-11177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00236772177188633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01615naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245008700172300001300259520052400272592002800796650002700824650002100851650001500872650000900887650003400896653001800930653002100948653002900969653002700998653002501025700002601050773009501076856008501171852000901256655001201265IND60610005920221120184513.0180824e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061000592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.econlet.2017.08.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhunov, Muzaffar10aRisk attitudes and entrepreneurial motivations: Evidence from transition economies  ap. 7-11.  aMost studies on risk attitudes of entrepreneurs do not distinguish between those who want to be self-employed and those who have to run their own business for survival, or entrepreneurs by choice vs. by necessity.

This paper reports and discusses a study of the mechanical behavior and damage of a 2 × 2 twill woven carbon/ epoxy composite resulting from uniaxial tension in the warp and bias directions. A damage investigation was performed by using acoustic emission and full-field strain optical measurements, as well as X-ray and optical microscopy. As a result of the tests, the mechanical properties and strain values of the composite’s damage threshold were determined. Damage initiation when loaded in the warp and bias directions occurred between 0.2% and 0.3% and 0.88% and 1.71% of the applied strain, respectively. Microscopic examination showed that damage or cracks initiated where the yarn was crimped and at interactions between the warp and filling yarns. Full-field strain measurements highlighted the relation between the strain concentrations that are linked with the damage initiation and the reinforcement structure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aacoustics 3acarbon 3aeconomic threshold 3aepoxides 3afabrics 3alight microscopy 3amechanical properties 3atextile fibers 3ayarns 0a2 × 2 twill woven composites 0aacoustic emission 0adamage 0afull-field strain measurement 0amechanical properties0 tTextile research journal.g2011 Mar., v. 81, no. 4 p.412-428dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl46536x0040-51757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00405175103959963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03962naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245011000165300001400275500001900289520211300308592002802421650002002449650003402469650001502503650001802518650002002536650001602556650001402572650001802586650002602604650002402630650001702654650002102671650002002692650001102712650001102723650002302734650001202757650001902769650002002788650004302808653001702851653003302868653002102901653002102922653001802943653001902961653001802980653001802998653001403016700002703030700001503057700001403072700001603086700001603102773011403118856008303232852000903315655001203324IND60724239920221120234701.0210320e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072423992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ejbt.2021.01.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Xiaochun10aInhibition of preadipocyte differentiation by Lycium barbarum polysaccharide treatment in 3T3-L1 cultures  ap. 53-58.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aLycium barbarum (also called wolfberry), a famous Chinese traditional medicine and food ingredient, is well recognized for its significant role in preventing obesity; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying its preventive effects on fat accumulation are not well understood yet. The aim of this study was to determine the effects and mechanism of Lycium barbarum polysaccharides (LBP) on the proliferation and differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. MTT was used to detect the proliferation of 3T3-Ll preadipocytes. Oil red O staining and colorimetric analysis were used to detect cytosolic lipid accumulation during 3T3-L1 preadipocyte differentiation. Real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR (qPCR) technology was used to detect peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α (C/EBPα), adipocyte fatty-acid-binding protein (aP2), fatty acid synthase (FAS), and lipoprotein lipase (LPL) expression.The concentration of LBP from 25 to 200 μg/mL showed a tendency to inhibit the growth of preadipocytes at 24 h, and it inhibited the differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes in a dose-dependent manner. In the preadipocytes treated with 200 μg/mL LBP, there were reduced lipid droplets in the cytoplasm, and its effect was opposite to that of rosiglitazone (ROS), which significantly reduced the PPARγ, C/EBPα, aP2, FAS, and LPL mRNA expression of adipocytes.LBP exerts inhibitive effects on the proliferation and differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and decreases the cytoplasm accumulation of lipid droplets during induced differentiation of preadipocytes toward mature cells. Above phenomenon might link to lowered expression of PPARγ, C/EBPα, aP2, FAS, and LPL after LBP treatment. Thus, LBP could serve as a potential plant extract to treat human obesity or improve farm animal carcass quality via adjusting lipid metabolism.How to cite: Xu X, Chen W, Yu S, et al.

In this review, biological control is focused as an alternative, to some synthetic chemical treatments that cause environmental, human health, and food quality risks. In addition, several phytopathogenic microorganisms have developed resistance to some of these synthetic chemicals and become more difficult to control. Worldwide, the bio-pesticides market is growing annually at a rate of 44% in North America, 20% in Europe and Oceania, 10% in Latin and South American countries and 6% in Asia. Use of agro-industrial wastes and solid-state fermentation (SSF) technology offers an alternative to bio-pesticide production with advantages versus conventional submerged fermentations, as reduced cost and energy consumption, low production of residual water and high stability products. In this review, recent data about state of art regarding bio-pesticides production under SSF on agroindustrial wastes will be discussed. SSF can be defined as a microbial process that generally occurs on solid material in the absence of free water. This material has the ability to absorb water with or without soluble nutrients, since the substrate must have water to support the microorganism’s growth and metabolism. Changes in water content are analyzed in order to select the conditions for a future process, where water stress can be combined with the best spore production conditions, obtaining in this way an inexpensive biotechnological option for modern agriculture in developing countries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural products 3aagricultural wastes 3abiological control 3abiopesticides 3achemical treatment 3adeveloping countries 3afood quality 3afungi 3ahuman health 3amarkets 3anutrients 3apesticide application 3arisk 3asolid state fermentation 3aspores 3awater content 3awater stress 3aAsia 3aEurope 3aNorth America 3aPacific Ocean Islands 3aSouth America 0aAgroindustrial wastes 0abiological control agents 0ahydric stress and spore production 0asolid-state fermentation1 aRoussos, Sevastianos1 aHernández, Daniel,1 aRodriguez, Raul,1 aCastillo, Francisco1 aAguilar, Cristóbal N.0 tCritical reviews in biotechnology.g2015 July 3, v. 35, no. 3 p.326-333dInforma HealthcarewJournal:2047x1549-78017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3109/07388551.2013.8572923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02675naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002400146245006800170300001400238520147900252592002801731650002501759650002701784650001101811650001401822650001901836650002801855650001401883650001801897650001101915650001401926650001901940650002001959650002101979700002202000700002702022700003002049773009702079856008002176852000902256655001202265IND60083057520221119124519.0141101e20120201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008305752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ab.2011.10.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLanz, Henriëtte L.10aDevelopment and application of an in vitro apoptin kinase assay  ap. 68-74.  aApoptin, a protein derived from chicken anemia virus (CAV), induces apoptosis selectively in human tumor cells as compared with normal cells. This activity depends on phosphorylation and relocation of apoptin to the nucleus of cancer cells. Here, we describe an in vitro kinase assay that allows the biochemical characterization of apoptin kinase activity in tumor cells. The kinase phosphorylates apoptin in a strictly ATP-dependent fashion and in a broad salt range. The kinase activity is present constitutively in both cytoplasm and nucleus of various human tumor cells. Q-column chromatography showed that both cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions have identical fractionation characteristics, suggesting that the same kinase is present in both cellular compartments. Kinase activity derived from positive Q-column fractions bound to amylose–maltose-binding protein (MBP)–apoptin and could be eluted with ATP only in the presence of the cofactor Mg²⁺. Apparently, unphosphorylated apoptin interacts with the kinase and is released only after phosphorylation has occurred, proving that our assay recognizes the genuine apoptin kinase. This is further corroborated by the finding that apoptin is phosphorylated in vitro at positions Thr108 and Thr107, in concert with earlier in vivo observations. Our assay excludes cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) and protein kinase C beta (PKC-β), previously nominated by two separate studies as being the genuine apoptin kinase.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChicken anemia virus 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aanemia 3aapoptosis 3achromatography 3acyclin-dependent kinase 3acytoplasm 3afractionation 3ahumans 3amagnesium 3aneoplasm cells 3aphosphorylation 3aprotein kinase C1 aFlorea, Bogdan I.1 aNoteborn, Mathieu H.M.1 aBackendorf, C.q(Claude),0 tAnalytical biochemistry.g2012 Feb. 1, v. 421, no. 1 p.68-74dElsevier Inc.x0003-26977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ab.2011.10.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01675naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245009300173300001400266520067900280592002800959650001400987650001101001653000801012653000801020653003001028653003201058653003401090653001501124653002001139773009601159856008501255852000901340655001201349IND60610006320221120184427.0180824e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061000632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.econlet.2017.08.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartin, Robert S.10aEstimation of average marginal effects in multiplicative unobserved effects panel models  ap. 16-19.  aIn multiplicative unobserved effects panel models for nonnegative dependent variables, estimation of average marginal effects would seem problematic with a large cross section and few time periods due to the incidental parameters problem. While fixed effects Poisson consistently estimates the slope parameters of the conditional mean function, marginal effects generally depend on the unobserved heterogeneity. However, I show that a class of fixed effects averages is consistent and asymptotically normal with only the cross section growing. This implies researchers can estimate average treatment effects in levels as opposed to settling for average proportional effects.  aPublisher supplied data 3aeconomics 3amodels 0aC13 0aC23 0aAverage treatment effects 0aFixed effects Poisson model 0aIncidental parameters problem 0aPanel data 0aPartial effects0 tEconomics letters.g2017 Nov., v. 160 p.16-19dElsevier B.V.wJournal:3059x0165-17657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.econlet.2017.08.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02514naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245015000173300001600323520113600339592002801475650001801503650001201521650000901533650002101542650001701563650001601580650001001596650001601606650001401622651001501636653001101651653001601662653001301678653001501691653001801706700002101724700001501745700001701760700001401777700001401791700001901805773012501824856008601949852000902035655001202044IND60759865420221117170335.0220910e20210101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075986542DNAL7 a10.1080/24750263.2021.18837522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKuzdrowska, K.

The description is based on morphological and morphometric data (using both light and scanning electron microscopy), combined with genetic data (nuclear sequences, i.e., 18S rRNA, 28S rRNA and mitochondrial COI sequences). Based on egg chorion morphology the new species is most similar to: Mac. hannae, Mac. joannae, Mac. kamilae, Mac. madegassus, Mac. modestus, Mac. paulinae and Mac. polypiformis, but differs from them in several morphological and morphometrical characters of eggs and adults (e.g. absence of eyes, different oral cavity armature, size of cuticular pores, absence of dentated lunules under claws, size of eggs and egg processes, and shape of terminal discs of egg processes). The uncorrected genetic p–distances enabled an independent verification of Macrobiotus porifini sp. nov. as a species new to science. Genetic analysis also allowed us to determine the phylogenetic position of Mac. porifini sp. nov. within the hufelandi group.urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:7D719ACC-84E3-4C1B-9B74-C558788B3140  aPublisher supplied data 3aMacrobiotidae 3achorion 3aeggs 3agenetic analysis 3amitochondria 3amorphometry 3amouth 3anew species 3aphylogeny 3aMadagascar 0aAfrica 0asystematics 0ataxonomy 0aTardigrada 0aDNA barcoding1 aMioduchowska, M.1 aGawlak, M.1 aBartylak, T.1 aKepel, A.1 aKepel, M.1 aKaczmarek, Ł.0 tThe European zoological journal.g2021 Jan. 01, v. 88, no. 1 p.375-389dTaylor & FranciswJournal:27397x2475-02637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/24750263.2021.18837523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01772naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100002400180245008600204300001800290506007600308520045400384592002800838506003700866650002400903650001800927650001700945650002300962650002300985650002901008650002201037650001401059700001401073700001501087700002201102700001901124700001801143773010501161856007501266852000901341655001201350IND60578668920221207112446.0170813e20130405xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057866892DNAL7 a10.1021/ol40046142doi7 aPMC36639202pmcid7 a235211452pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlmabruk, Khaled H.10aMutasynthesis of Fluorinated Pactamycin Analogues and Their Antimalarial Activity  ap. 1678-1681.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aA mutasynthetic strategy has been used to generate fluorinated TM-025 and TM-026, two biosynthetically engineered pactamycin analogues produced by Streptomyces pactum ATCC 27456.

The aim was to spot check the quality of the most commonly purchased types of fish that are available for sale in most common supermarket chains throughout the Poland, as well as to determine potentially less contaminated sources of fish available for retail. A dry ashing digestion protocol followed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry analysis was employed to achieve a better recover of heavy metals and As from fish muscle tissues. RESULTS: The cumulative concentration of metals and As in fish muscle tissue decreases in order: farmed Atlantic salmon > mackerel > Baltic cod > rainbow trout > canned tuna fish > Atlantic cod > yellowfin tuna steak. It was found that canned tuna from Central and Eastern Pacific Ocean were more contaminated than tuna from East and West Indian Ocean, Baltic cod was significantly more contaminated than cod from North‐East Atlantic. Smoked mackerel from North‐East Pacific Ocean is three times more contaminated than mackerel from Northern North Sea. All fish, except for yellowfin tuna steak, should not be intended for retail because they exceed maximum levels for Cd and Pb. CONCLUSION: Consuming only one serving (140 g) of Baltic cod exposes one to 51% of the daily acceptable Cd intake, while the same portion of canned tuna and smoked mackerel from the Pacific Ocean deliver 69% and 72% of this element respectively. The most cadmium is consumed with smoked mackerel from the North Sea, comprising as much as 162% of the daily acceptable dosage . © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data  a16.16.140.315cAkademia Górniczo‐Hutnicza im.

Due to its low price and wide distribution, lignocellulosic biomass is expected to play an important role toward this goal. Regarding renewable biofuel production, bioethanol from lignocellulosic feedstocks is considered the most feasible option for fossil fuels replacement since these raw materials do not compete with food or feed crops. In the overall process, lignin, the natural barrier of the lignocellulosic biomass, represents an important limiting factor in biomass digestibility. In order to reduce the recalcitrant structure of lignocellulose, biological pretreatments have been promoted as sustainable and environmentally friendly alternatives to traditional physico-chemical technologies, which are expensive and pollute the environment. These approaches include the use of diverse white-rot fungi and/or ligninolytic enzymes, which disrupt lignin polymers and facilitate the bioconversion of the sugar fraction into ethanol. As there is still no suitable biological pretreatment technology ready to scale up in an industrial context, white-rot fungi and/or ligninolytic enzymes have also been proposed to overcome, in a separated or in situ biodetoxification step, the effect of the inhibitors produced by non-biological pretreatments. The present work reviews the latest studies regarding the application of different microorganisms or enzymes as useful and environmentally friendly delignification and detoxification technologies for lignocellulosic biofuel production. This review also points out the main challenges and possible ways to make these technologies a reality for the bioethanol industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioenergy industry 3abioethanol 3abiomass 3abiorefining 3abiotransformation 3acrops 3adelignification 3adigestibility 3aethanol 3aethanol production 3afeedstocks 3afossil fuels 3afuel production 3aheat 3alignin 3alignocellulose 3aprices 3asugars 3avalue added 3awhite-rot fungi 0abiodelignification 0abiodetoxification 0abiorefinery 0aligninolytic enzymes1 aIbarra, David1 aAlvira, Pablo1 aTomás-Pejó, Elia1 aBallesteros, Mercedes0 tCritical reviews in biotechnology.g2015 July 3, v. 35, no. 3 p.342-354dInforma HealthcarewJournal:2047x1549-78017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3109/07388551.2013.8788963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02123naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245012600166300001800292520108700310592002801397650001101425650002901436650001501465650001401480650001301494650001301507650001501520650001101535650001101546650001501557651001001572700002501582773009701607856004801704852000901752655001201761IND50058941920221123032821.0121011e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5005894192DNAL7 a10.1007/s12237-012-9537-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMooney, Rae F.10aWatershed Export Events and Ecosystem Responses in the Mission–Aransas National Estuarine Research Reserve, South Texas  ap. 1468-1485.  aWhile inputs from land are recognized as important resources supporting production in estuaries, the role that storm events play in resource delivery and the response of estuarine systems to pulsed inputs are less well appreciated. Temporal variations in (1) watershed export via the Mission and Aransas rivers and (2) nutrient and organic matter dynamics in Copano Bay were examined in the Mission–Aransas National Estuarine Research Reserve, south Texas. Inorganic nutrient, dissolved organic matter (DOM), and particulate organic matter (POM) concentrations in the rivers varied substantially with discharge, as did carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios of POM. Accounting for these variations was critical for calculating robust watershed export estimates. In Copano Bay, soluble reactive phosphorus, POM, and DOM remained elevated for several months following major runoff events, whereas inorganic nitrogen was rapidly depleted. Chlorophyll-a concentrations and POC-δ13C in Copano Bay showed that increased POM concentrations were linked to enhanced in situ production.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3adissolved organic matter 3aecosystems 3aestuaries 3aisotopes 3anitrogen 3aphosphorus 3arivers 3arunoff 3awatersheds 3aTexas1 aMcClelland, James W.0 tEstuaries and coasts.g2012 Nov., v. 35, no. 6 p.1468-1485dSpringer-Verlagx1559-27237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12237-012-9537-4  aDNAL 7aarticle02259naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005100150245005100201300001800252500001900270520103900289592002801328650000801356650002501364650001501389650002101404650002601425650003801451650002401489700001501513700005501528700001401583700001501597700005201612773012801664856008401792852000901876655001201885IND60728013720221119150042.0210216e20210126xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072801372DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.0c046872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Hui1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3346-613310aAptamer-Linked CRISPR/Cas12a-Based Immunoassay  ap. 3209-3216.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/Cas system has shown great promising applications in the area of nucleic acid biosensing. However, because of the dearth of versatile signal transduction strategies, this system is usually compromised to low versatility, moderate sensitivity, and complex operation for non-nucleic acid targets, limiting its clinical transition. Herein, we describe a direct method to establish the correlation between non-nucleic acid analytes and the CRISPR/Cas12a system using a series of rationally designed, aptamer-flanked activator DNA strands, which enable ultrasensitive detection of biomarkers from different species, greatly broadening the possibility of the CRISPR/Cas system in bioanalysis. Meanwhile, the signal output is highly optional and the sensing principle is akin to the traditional enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), so it can be directly imposed on the currently available ELISA platform, further facilitating its application in medical diagnostics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aanalytical chemistry 3abiomarkers 3achemical species 3adiagnostic techniques 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3asignal transduction1 aLi, Menglu1 aYang, Yucai1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6634-32151 aWang, Fei1 aWang, Feng1 aLi, Chao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2552-413X0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2021 Jan. 26, v. 93, no. 6 p.3209-3216dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.0c046873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03406naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002500166245012700191300001600318520169200334592002802026650002102054650002002075650001202095650002902107650001102136650002902147650001802176650002102194650002302215650001202238650001202250650002702262650002802289650001602317650002802333650002902361650003802390650001602428650001302444650003102457650001802488650002902506650002302535650003102558650002002589650003802609650001602647700003202663773008802695856004802783852000902831655001202840IND50063105520221120035118.0130324e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006310552DNAL7 a232291352pmid7 a10.1007/s10646-012-1027-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArdestani, Masoud M.10aDynamic bioavailability of copper in soil estimated by uptake and elimination kinetics in the springtail Folsomia candida   ap. 308-318.  aThis study aimed to assess the bioavailability of copper in soil, by measuring its uptake kinetics into a representative soil invertebrate, the collembolan Folsomia candida. The animals were exposed to 25 or 100 μg Cu g⁻¹ dry LUFA 2.2 soil at nominal [Formula: see text] 4.5, 5.5, or 6.5 during 14 days after which they were transferred to clean soil for 14 days elimination. Uptake and elimination rate constants were calculated based on total and extractable soil concentrations and porewater concentrations using one-compartment first-order kinetics modelling. Copper was present in the animals at a basal physiological level of 40–90 μg g⁻¹dry weight, on top of this uptake and elimination kinetics were observed. Uptake rates constants varied between 0.02 and 0.17 gₛₒᵢₗ g ₐₙᵢₘₐₗ ⁻¹ day⁻¹, being higher at lower exposure level, but did not differ significantly between different soil pH levels. Elimination rate constants ranged between 0.04 and 0.20 day⁻¹ and were negligible (k₂ < 0.001 day⁻¹) at pH 4.5 and 6.5. Multiple linear regressions showed that the pH effect on copper uptake was only significant when taking into account cation exchange capacity, or calcium and dissolved organic carbon levels in the pore water. Copper concentrations in the animals however, never were higher than 185 μg g⁻¹ dry weight, independent of exposure level and pH, suggesting homeostatic regulation. These results show that the chemical composition of the pore water does affect bioavailability of copper in soil, but that copper uptake in collembolans is dominated by homeostatic regulation rather than by soil properties like pH.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFolsomia candida 3abioavailability 3acalcium 3acation exchange capacity 3acopper 3adissolved organic carbon 3alinear models 3apharmacokinetics 3asoil invertebrates 3asoil pH 2aAnimals 2aArthropodsxmetabolism 2aBiological Availability 2aBody Burden 2aChi-Square Distribution 2aCopperxpharmacokinetics 2aEnvironmental Monitoringxmethods 2aHomeostasis 2aHumidity 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aLinear Models 2aMetabolic Clearance Rate 2aModels, Biological 2aNitratesxpharmacokinetics 2aSoilxchemistry 2aSoil Pollutantsxpharmacokinetics 2aTemperature1 aGestel, Cornelis A.

Humankind actively influences Si fluxes by intensified land use, i.e., agriculture and forestry, on a global scale. We hypothesized phytolith distribution and assemblages in soils of agricultural and forestry sites to be controlled by vegetation (which is directed by land use) with direct effects on extractable Si fractions driven mainly by phytolith characteristics, i.e., dissolution status (dissolution signs) and morphology (morphotype proportions). To test our hypothesis we combined different chemical extraction methods (calcium chloride, ammonium oxalate, Tiron) for the quantification of different Si fractions (plant available Si, Si adsorbed to/occluded in pedogenic oxides/hydroxides, amorphous Si) and microscopic techniques (light microscopy, confocal laser scanning microscopy, scanning electron microscopy) for detailed analyses of phytoliths extracted using gravimetric separation (physical extraction) from exemplary loess soils of agricultural (arable land and grassland/meadow) and forestry (beech and pine) sites in Poland. We found differences in dissolution signs, morphotype proportions, and vertical distribution of phytoliths in soil horizons per site. In general, dominant morphotypes of assignable phytoliths in the studied soil profiles were elongate phytoliths and short cells, both of which are typical for grass-dominated vegetation. However, the organic layers of forest soils were dominated by globular phytoliths, which are typical indicators for mosses. As expected soil horizons under different vegetation generally were characterized by differences in extractable Si fractions, especially in the upper soil horizons. However, phytogenic Si pools counter-intuitively showed no correlations with chemically extracted Si fractions and soil pH at all. Our findings indicate that it is necessary to combine microscopic analyses and Si extraction techniques for examinations of Si cycling in biogeosystems, because extractions of Si fractions alone do not allow drawing any conclusions about phytolith characteristics or interactions between phytolith pools and chemically extractable Si fractions and do not necessarily reflect phytogenic Si pool quantities in soils and vice versa.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFagus 3aPinus 3aammonium oxalate 3aaquatic ecosystems 3aarable soils 3acalcium chloride 3aconfocal laser scanning microscopy 3aforest soils 3aforestry 3ahydroxides 3aland use 3alight microscopy 3aloess 3aloess soils 3ameadows 3amorphs 3amosses and liverworts 3aoxides 3aphytoliths 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asilicon 3asoil horizons 3asoil pH 3asoil profiles 3aspatial distribution 3aPoland 0aPhytolith dissolution 0aPhytolith morphotypes 0aSi extraction 0aSurface roughness parameters 0aSi cycling1 aPuppe, Daniel1 aBusse, Jacqueline1 aSommer, Michael0 tGeoderma.g2019 Aug. 16, dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl16374x0016-70617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2019.1139173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03346naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006400150245013800214300001800352520203800370592002802408650001502436650002302451650001702474650002602491650001702517650002202534650001802556650001202574650002202586650001102608650002302619650001102642700006002653700002402713773012902737856008502866852000902951655001202960IND60771925420221122104218.0220330e20220317xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077192542DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.1c049852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBonetti, Jennifer L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0348-536810aUtilization of Machine Learning for the Differentiation of Positional NPS Isomers with Direct Analysis in Real Time Mass Spectrometry  ap. 5029-5040.  aThe differentiation of positional isomers is a well established analytical challenge for forensic laboratories. As more novel psychoactive substances (NPSs) are introduced to the illicit drug market, robust yet efficient methods of isomer identification are needed. Although current literature suggests that Direct Analysis in Real Time–Time-of-Flight mass spectrometry (DART-ToF) with in-source collision induced dissociation (is-CID) can be used to differentiate positional isomers, it is currently unclear whether this capability extends to positional isomers whose only structural difference is the precise location of a single substitution on an aromatic ring. The aim of this work was to determine whether chemometric analysis of DART-ToF data could offer forensic laboratories an alternative rapid and robust method of differentiating NPS positional ring isomers. To test the feasibility of this technique, three positional isomer sets (fluoroamphetamine, fluoromethamphetamine, and methylmethcathinone) were analyzed. Using a linear rail for consistent sample introduction, the three isomers of each type were analyzed 96 times over an eight-week timespan. The classification methods investigated included a univariate approach, the Welch t test at each included ion; a multivariate approach, linear discriminant analysis; and a machine learning approach, the Random Forest classifier. For each method, multiple validation techniques were used including restricting the classifier to data that was only generated on one day. Of these classification methods, the Random Forest algorithm was ultimately the most accurate and robust, consistently achieving out-of-bag error rates below 5%. At an inconclusive rate of approximately 5%, a success rate of 100% was obtained for isomer identification when applied to a randomly selected test set. The model was further tested with data acquired as a part of a different batch. The highest classification success rate was 93.9%, and error rates under 5% were consistently achieved.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aaromatic compounds 3achemometrics 3adiscriminant analysis 3adissociation 3aforensic sciences 3aillicit drugs 3amarkets 3amass spectrometry 3amodels 3apositional isomers 3at-test1 aSamanipour, Saer1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8270-69791 avan Asten, Arian C.0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2022 Mar. 17, v. 94, no. 12 p.5029-5040dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.1c049853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02964naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245016900166300001600335520129400351592002801645650004801673650002401721650001301745650001201758650001501770650002301785650002201808650002001830650001101850650002101861650001701882650001401899650001001913650001701923650000901940653002401949653001101973653002001984653003202004653002702036700001502063700001402078700001602092700001502108700001402123700001602137700001602153700002102169773012702190856008402317852000902401655001202410IND60121736220221122225736.0150324e20140803xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012173622DNAL7 a10.1080/15226514.2013.8370272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTruyens, S.14aThe Effect of Long-Term Cd and Ni Exposure on Seed Endophytes of Agrostis capillaris and Their Potential Application in Phytoremediation of Metal-Contaminated Soils  ap. 643-659.  aWe examined whether long-term Cd exposure leads to beneficial changes in the cultivable endophytic bacteria present in the seeds of Agrostis capillaris . Therefore the cultivable seed endophytes of Agrostis capillaris growing on a long-term Cd/Ni-contaminated plot (Cd/Ni seeds) were compared with those originating from a non-contaminated plot (control seeds). We observed plant- and contaminant-dependent effects on the population composition between control and Cd/Ni seeds. Also differences in phenotypic characteristics were found: endophytes from Cd/Ni seeds exhibited more ACC deaminase activity and production of siderophores and IAA, while endophytes from control seeds, very surprisingly, showed more metal tolerance. Finally, the 3 most promising seed endophytes were selected based on their metal tolerance and plant growth promoting potential, and inoculated in Agrostis capillaris seedlings. In case of non-exposed plants, inoculation resulted in a significantly improved plant growth; after inoculation of Cd-exposed plants an increased Cd uptake was achieved without affecting plant growth. This indicates that inoculation of Agrostis with its seed endophytes might be beneficial for its establishment during phytoextraction and phytostabilisation of Cd-contaminated soils.  aPublisher supplied data 3a1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate deaminase 3aAgrostis capillaris 3abacteria 3acadmium 3aendophytes 3aindole acetic acid 3along term effects 3ametal tolerance 3anickel 3aphytoremediation 3aplant growth 3aseedlings 3aseeds 3asiderophores 3asoil 0aAgrostis capillaris 0ametals 0aseed endophytes 0aphenotypic characterisation 0aplant growth promotion1 aJambon, I.1 aCroes, S.1 aJanssen, J.1 aWeyens, N.1 aMench, M.1 aCarleer, R.1 aCuypers, A.1 aVangronsveld, J.0 tInternational journal of phytoremediation.g2014 Aug. 3, v. 16, no. 7-8 p.643-659dTaylor & Francis Groupx1549-78797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15226514.2013.8370273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02232naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002400094040001800118100002600136245007000162300001600232500002000248520096600268592002801234650002101262650001101283650001101294650002501305650001301330650001101343650001501354650001401369650001401383650001901397651001001416651001401426651001301440651001401453700003001467700002001497700002201517700002301539700003101562773010101593856007101694852000901765655001201774IND60787232520221120144340.0220808e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078723252DNAL7 a10.12705/674.32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPoulsen, Axel Dalberg10aSulettaria: A new ginger genus disjunct from Elettaria cardamomum  ap. 725-738.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIn 1950, Holttum placed species from Malaysia in the cardamom genus, Elettaria, while noting that they may, in fact, belong elsewhere in the tribe Alpinieae.

In the resulting molecular phylogeny, these samples appeared in three separate places of the Alpinieae. Elettaria s.str. is endemic in India and Sri Lanka while all species from Peninsular Malaysia, Sumatra and Borneo are placed in a new genus, Sulettaria which, furthermore, includes six species with basionyms in Amomum, A. kandariense from Sulawesi and the other five from Borneo. Fifteen new combinations are made, an identification key provided and lectotypes designated for three species.

However, as one of the simplest electron-accepting (A) units, phthalimide (PhI) only attracts less attention to construct promising D-π-A photovoltaic polymers in the OSC community. Thus, the correlations among the chemical structure, optoelectronic properties, and photovoltaic performance need to be systematically investigated. Here, we combined the PhI moiety with the electron-donating (D) unit benzodithiophene (BDT) to synthesize two D-π-A copolymers PE80 and PE81, where the π-bridge corresponds to the thiophene (T) and thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (TT), respectively. When blended with a low-band-gap (Eg = 1.33 eV) nonfullerene acceptor Y6, PE81 achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 10.21% with an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.90 V, which are much higher than those of the PE80:Y6 device (PCE = 4.11% and VOC = 0.88 V). Our results indicate that PhI is also a promising electron-deficient unit to construct photovoltaic polymers and using a TT π-bridge is a simple strategy to improve the photovoltaic performance of D-π-A polymers.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomposite polymers 3aelectric potential difference 3amoieties 3aphthalimide 3asolar cells 3athiophene1 aChen, You1 aLi, Jianfeng1 aGeng, Yanfang1 aJi, Hongru1 aLi, Gongqiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4567-49761 aTang, Ailing1 aGuo, Qiang1 aZhou, Erjun1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1182-311X0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2019 Dec. 05, v. 124, no. 1 p.230-236dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b105803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04255naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245010700168300001600275520232300291592002802614650001702642650001702659650001702676650001602693650001902709650001802728650001502746650002602761650001902787650002202806650002002828650001402848650001602862650002502878650002602903650001502929650001902944650001502963650002202978650002003000650001303020651001803033653001803051653001503069653002003084653001803104653001603122653001303138653001603151653004603167653001403213653001803227653000903245700002403254700002303278700002203301700001703323700001703340700002203357773010003379856008103479852000903560655001203569IND60545068020221116165510.0170719e20150915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054506802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rse.2015.05.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHestir, Erin Lee10aMeasuring freshwater aquatic ecosystems: The need for a hyperspectral global mapping satellite mission  ap. 181-195.  aFreshwater ecosystems underpin global water and food security, yet are some of the most endangered ecosystems in the world because they are particularly vulnerable to land management change and climate variability. The US National Research Council's guidance to NASA regarding missions for the coming decade includes a polar orbiting, global mapping hyperspectral satellite remote sensing mission, the Hyperspectral Infrared Imager (HyspIRI), to make quantitative measurements of ecosystem change. Traditionally, freshwater ecosystems have been challenging to measure with satellite remote sensing because they are small and spatially complex, require high fidelity spectroradiometry, and are best described with biophysical variables derived from high spectral resolution data. In this study, we evaluate the contribution of a hyperspectral global mapping satellite mission to measuring freshwater ecosystems. We demonstrate the need for such a mission, and evaluate the suitability and gaps, through an examination of the measurement resolution issues impacting freshwater ecosystem measurements (spatial, temporal, spectral and radiometric). These are exemplified through three case studies that use remote sensing to characterize a component of freshwater ecosystems that drive primary productivity. The high radiometric quality proposed for the HyspIRI mission makes it uniquely well designed for measuring freshwater ecosystems accurately at moderate to high spatial resolutions. The spatial and spectral resolutions of the HyspIRI mission are well suited for the retrieval of multiple biophysical variables, such as phycocyanin and chlorophyll-a. The effective temporal resolution is suitable for characterizing growing season wetland phenology in temperate regions, but may not be appropriate for tracking algal bloom dynamics, or ecosystem responses to extreme events in monsoonal regions. Global mapping missions provide the systematic, repeated measurements necessary to measure the drivers of freshwater biodiversity change. Archival global mapping missions with open access and free data policies increase end user uptake globally. Overall, an archival, hyperspectral global mapping mission uniquely meets the measurement requirements of multiple end users for freshwater ecosystem science and management.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgal blooms 3abiodiversity 3acase studies 3achlorophyll 3aclimate change 3afood security 3afreshwater 3afreshwater ecosystems 3agrowing season 3aissues and policy 3aland management 3aphenology 3aphycocyanin 3aprimary productivity 3aquantitative analysis 3aradiometry 3aremote sensing 3asatellites 3aspectral analysis 3atemperate zones 3awetlands 3aUnited States 0aWater quality 0aFreshwater 0aAquatic ecology 0aChlorophyll-a 0aPhycocyanin 0aWetlands 0aMacrophytes 0aSpatial–spectral–temporal resolutions 0aLake size 0aHyperspectral 0aAPEX1 aBrando, Vittorio E.1 aBresciani, Mariano1 aGiardino, Claudia1 aMatta, Erica1 aVilla, Paolo1 aDekker, Arnold G.0 tRemote sensing of environment.g2015 Sept. 15, v. 167 p.181-195dElsevier Inc.x0034-42577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2015.05.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01346naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005500094040001800149100001800167245009900185300001600284520040200300592002800702653001500730653001900745653001600764653001600780653001000796700001700806773010900823856011500932852000901047655001201056IND60127321520221121235012.0151110e200806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012732152DNAL7 a10.1653/0015-4040(2008)91[283:FNSOTG]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Dongbao10aFive New Species of the Genus Microplitis (Hymenoptera: Braconidae: Microgastrinae) from China  ap. 283-293.  aFive new species of the genus Microplitis Foerster (Hymenoptera: Braconidae: Microgastrinae) are described and illustrated: Microplitis basipallescentis, sp. nov., M. brevispina, sp. nov., M. carinata, sp. nov., M. changbaishana, sp. nov. and M. crassiantenna, sp. nov.

Most firms and companies, however, still largely focus on efficiency strategies leading to sub-optimal solutions (reducing bad impact), rather than radically changing their business model to develop new transaction models more appropriate for today’s world (doing better things). However, persistent sustainability issues arising from our changing societal systems, require more radical and structural changes both within and between organizations to change the way we do business. There is limited empirically established research literature on how businesses can be more proactive in this regard and how they can move beyond “management of unsustainability”. In this paper, we present a transformative business model innovation approach inspired by transition theory combining elements of systems thinking, value-inspired envisioning, reflexive design and co-creation that was pioneered for a consortia of reuse centers in the province of Limburg, Belgium. We demonstrate that this approach contributed to the development of new business model concepts, was conducive for mobilizing support and resources to ensure follow up activity and holds potential to promote a more proactive role for businesses as agents of transformative change.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3abusiness enterprises 3aclimate change 3aeconometric models 3aenergy 3aBelgium1 aVrancken, Karl1 aManshoven, Saskia0 tSustainability.g2016 Jan. 26, v. 8, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su80201123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02893naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002300141245014200164300001400306520134100320592002801661650001901689650002001708650002701728650001201755650001401767650001101781650002101792650002401813650002301837650002401860650001901884650001601903650001901919650002101938650001001959651001801969653003001987653001802017653001402035653001602049653002402065653002302089653001802112700002602130700002502156773010902181856007602290852000902366655001202375IND60644821220221119140325.0190604e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064482122DNAL7 a10.5558/tfc2019-0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLamontagne, Manuel10aOrganic fertilization of Christmas tree (Abies balsamea (L.)

The objective was to compare poultry manure as an organic fertilizer to the commonly used commercial mineral fertilizer, and establish the rate and frequency of manure application. Six fertilization treatments were applied in a randomized block design monitored during five years: one control (0 g N), one mineral fertilizer treatment (20 g N tree⁻¹ year⁻¹ as 20-10-10 (NPK)) and four poultry manure applications ((4-1-2 NPK) 20 g N tree⁻¹ year⁻¹, 40 g N tree⁻¹ year⁻¹, 40 g N tree⁻¹ every two years and 80 g N tree⁻¹/2 yrs). Photosynthesis, soil respiration and specific leaf area were slightly increased by the manure treatments. Height and diameter relative growth rates were similar among fertilization treatments. Manure treated trees had nutritional status similar or better than mineral fertilizer treated trees. Manure treatments had the highest percentages of dark green foliage trees appreciated by buyers. Poultry manure was as efficient as the mineral fertilizer. Considering fertilizers and operations costs, the application of poultry manure at the rate of 40 g N tree⁻¹ /2 yrs seemed the one to be recommended to growers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAbies balsamea 3aChristmas trees 3afertilizer application 3agrowers 3aleaf area 3aleaves 3amanure spreading 3amineral fertilizers 3anutritional status 3aorganic fertilizers 3aphotosynthesis 3aplantations 3apoultry manure 3asoil respiration 3atrees 3aNew Brunswick 0aChristmas tree plantation 0afertilization 0anutrients 0agrowth rate 0aphotosynthesis rate 0aspecific leaf area 0afoliage color1 aAdégbidi, Hector Guy1 aAssamoi, Abbé Jonas0 tForestry chronicle.g2019 Jan., v. 95, no. 1 p.39-49dNRC Research PresswJournal:12176x0015-75467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.5558/tfc2019-0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01928naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005500094040001800149100001700167245013000184300001600314520086100330592002801191653002501219653004001244653002801284653001401312653002001326653002401346653002201370773011001392856011501502852000901617655001201626IND60127321720221121235021.0151110e200809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012732172DNAL7 a10.1653/0015-4040(2008)91[353:EODPCF]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAl-Ayedh, H.10aEvaluation of Date Palm Cultivars for Rearing the Red Date Palm Weevil, Rhynchophorus ferrugineus (Coleoptera: Curculionidae)  ap. 353-358.  aDevelopment of red date palm weevil Rhynchophorus ferrugineus (Olivier) was evaluated on 4 popular cultivars of date palm, viz., ‘‘Khalas’’, ‘‘Sukkary’’, ‘‘Khasab’’, and ‘‘Sillaj’’ for 2 consecutive generations. The weevils reared on ‘‘Sukkary’’ showed significantly better growth expressed in most parameters such as length, width and weight at larval, pupal and adult stages. Significantly greater numbers of eggs were laid on cv. ‘‘Sukkary’’ as compared to the other 3 cultivars. This might be because of higher sugar content of cv. ‘‘Sukkary’’. Adult lifespan was significantly longer on cv. ‘‘Khasab’’. Though more cocoons were harvested from ‘‘Khalas’’, frequency of adult emergence was better on ‘‘Sukkary’’.

However, strategies to functionalize COFs with biomacromolecules, which can ensure the stability in complex medium and minimize the undesired effects, are still lacking. In this work, we have proposed a strategy to functionalize COFs with DNA by covalently linking DNA to the functional group on the COF surface through Cu(I)-catalyzed azide/alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) reaction. The as-prepared DNA-functionalized COFs (DNA-COFs) can exhibit good hybridization ability and cargo loading ability; thus, we have designed a DNA-COF-based nanoprobe and then fabricated an electrochemical biosensor for the detection of exosomes. In this design, the functionalization with DNA enables COFs to recognize and capture exosomes, and the encapsulation of a large number of methylene blue (MB) in COFs facilitates signal amplification, which can enhance the sensitivity of the biosensor. Moreover, by simply replacing the oligonucleotide sequences, the strategy proposed here can generally be used to build different DNA-COFs with diverse functions for broader biomedical applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aalkynes 3aanalytical chemistry 3aazides 3abiomedical research 3abiosensors 3achemical bonding 3acycloaddition reactions 3aencapsulation 3aexosomes 3ahybridization 3amethylene blue 3aoligonucleotides1 aWang, Minghui1 aHan, Yiwei1 aDeng, Ying1 aZeng, Yujing1 aLi, Chao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2552-413X1 aYang, Jie1 aLi, Genxi1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9663-99140 tAnalytical chemistry.g2022 Mar. 15, v. 94, no. 12 p.5055-5061dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.1c052223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03130naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024004300133040001800176100001500194245011800209300001600327500001500343506007600358520136600434592002801800506003701828650000901865650001001874650001201884650001301896650002201909650001301931650001401944650003001958650001301988650002702001650001602028650001502044650006002059650002702119650002702146650004202173650001902215650001902234653001702253700002302270700001702293700002302310700002402333700002602357773008302383856008902466852000902555655001202564IND4466460020221207060309.0141110e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446646002DNAL7 a218246392pmid7 aPMC32069822pmcid7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2011.07.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Yang10aCrystal structure and density functional theory studies of toxic quinone metabolites of polychlorinated biphenyls  ap. 386-392.  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aLower chlorinated polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are readily metabolized via hydroxylated metabolites to reactive PCB quinones. Although these PCB metabolites elicit biochemical changes by mechanisms involving cellular target molecules, such as the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, and toxicity by interacting with enzymes like topoisomerases, only few PCB quinones have been synthesized and their conformational properties investigated. Similar to the parent compounds, knowledge of the three-dimensional structure of PCB quinones may therefore be important to assess their fate and risk. To address this gap in our knowledge, the gas phase molecular structure of a series of PCB quinones was predicted using HF/3-21G, B3LYP/6-31G∗∗ and UB3LYP/6-311G∗∗ calculations and compared to the respective solid state structure. All three methods overestimated the Cl–C bond length, but otherwise provided a reasonable approximation of the solid state bond angles and bond lengths. Overall, the UB3LYP/6-311G∗∗ level of theory yielded the best approximation of the molecular structure of PCB quinones in the solid state. Chlorine addition at the ortho position of both rings was found to increase the dihedral angle of the resulting quinone compound, which may have important implications for their interaction with cellular targets and, thus, their toxicity.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3arisk 3agases 3aenzymes 3achlorine 3acrystal structure 3aquinones 3areceptors 3apolychlorinated biphenyls 3atoxicity 3abiochemical mechanisms 3ametabolites 3aprediction 2aBenzoquinonesxchemical synthesisxchemistryxtoxicity. 2aCrystallography, X-Ray 2aMolecular Conformation 2aPolychlorinated Biphenylsxmetabolism 2aQuantum Theory 2aThermodynamics 0ahydrocarbons1 aAmbati, Jyothirmai1 aParkin, Sean1 aRankin, Stephen E.1 aRobertson, Larry W.1 aLehmler, Hans-Joachim0 tChemosphere.g2011 Oct., v. 85, no. 3 p.386-392dElsevier Ltdx0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2011.07.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03404naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245014500164300001600309520209900325592002802424650001502452650001502467650001102482650001702493650001302510650002202523650001402545650001302559650002202572700001802594700001802612700002102630700001702651700006102668700005502729773013302784856008002917852000902997655001203006IND60680950420221121002318.0200110e20191121xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068095042DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b108122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Hongwei10aDistinct Excited-State Dynamics of Near-Orthogonal Perylenimide Dimer: Conformational Planarization versus Symmetry Breaking Charge Transfer  ap. 237-245.  aEfficient photoinduced charge separation in artificial multichromophoric architectures relies on two critical factors, (i) electronic coupling and (ii) solvation. While the coherent exciton interactions delocalize the excitation energy among molecules, the solvation-dependent dynamical disorder tends to localize it. Local environments such as solvent polarity/dielectric environments exhibit profound effect on mediating the excited-state relaxation dynamics via specific electronic/geometric changes in chromophore multimers. Herein, a comprehensive account of the solvent governed distinct exciton coupling and symmetry breaking charge separation in a near-orthogonal perylenimide dimer (PP) is presented employing steady-state, femtosecond transient absorption measurements and quantum chemical calculations. Steady-state absorption measurements of the PP dimer reveal apparent electronic coupling between the two monomeric units, wherein the fluorescence measurements reveal a strong fluorescence character in nonpolar solvent, but a significantly quenched state is observed in polar solvent. Ultrafast transient absorption measurements reveal that the fluorescence quenching in polar solvent arises from a photoinduced symmetry-breaking charge transfer (SBCT) process and a subsequent population of the charge-separated radical ion-pair state. Contrastingly, in nonpolar solvent, the charge transfer is endothermic and energetically not feasible. Manifestly, the dimer in nonpolar solvent undergoes a conformational planarization within 20 ps accompanied by excitation delocalization over the two identical monomers in the lowest excited singlet state as evident from the dominant stimulated emission (around 580 nm) and the excited-state absorption (around 740 nm) in the femtosecond transient absorption spectra. Observed solvent-mediated selective control on the excited-state relaxation pathways in the near-orthogonal PP dimer can help shed light on the mechanisms of energy/charge transfer in molecular systems and guide the design of novel high-performance photovoltaic materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aendothermy 3aenergy 3afluorescence 3ageometry 3aquantum mechanics 3asolvation 3asolvents 3aspectral analysis1 aZhao, Hongmei1 aGuo, Yuanyuan1 aPhilip, Abbey M.1 aGuo, Qianjin1 aHariharan, Mahesh1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3237-62351 aXia, Andong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2325-31100 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2019 Nov. 21, v. 124, no. 1 p.237-245dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b108123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02905naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002600148245014900174300001600323520137300339592002801712650001601740650001501756650001001771650001901781650001401800650002301814650001301837650002101850650001101871650001501882650001501897650001101912650001301923650000901936653003001945653001301975653002501988653001502013653003602028700002002064700002002084700002102104700001702125700006302142773010202205856008302307852000902390655001202399IND60661489520221121042429.0191024e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066148952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcat.2019.08.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarbaniang, Phiralang10aForming a B[sbnd]B bond in boron carbon nitride composite: A way for metal free electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction reaction in alkaline medium  ap. 104-112.  aUnmanageable of oxygen electrochemistry on cathode side of fuel cells creates a major hindrance to designing a cell device. Effectively, Platinum alone cannot afford the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) due to several worries such as unaffordable cost, stability, scarcity and intermediate tolerance etc. that would hurdle the development of fuel cell technology. In order to demonstrate similar efforts, we discuss a synthesis of boron carbon nitride (BCN) nanosheets and its composite by thermal and solvothermal method respectively. The BCN nanosheets also show the formation of a homonuclear BB bond, which are important for enhancing oxygen affinity. Since the chemistry of BB bond involves higher bond energy, more reactivity or unusual gas adsorption behavior, thus making such sites promising towards stronger electrophilic interactions such as oxygen adsorption followed by its reduction. As synthesized BCN exhibits an interesting onset potential of ∼0.94 V in electroreduction of oxygen. More importantly, upon composite formation with carbon black, BCN shows further enhancement in the ORR kinetics with an onset potential of 1.01 V and a current density of 5 mA/cm2, which is very much comparable with Pt/C. An interesting phenomenon of activating O2 reduction using BCN has been systematically studied to unravel noble metal-free electrocatalysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLewis acids 3aadsorption 3aboron 3acarbon nitride 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acathodes 3aelectrochemistry 3aenergy 3afuel cells 3ananosheets 3aoxygen 3aplatinum 3asoot 0aOxygen reduction reaction 0aCatalyst 0aBoron carbon nitride 0aComposites 0aOnset potential and active site1 aIngavale, Sagar1 aCatherin, Divya1 aRamgir, Niranjan1 aSwami, Anita1 aKakade, Bhalchandra1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2353-54760 tJournal of catalysis.g2019 Oct., v. 378 p.104-112dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11700x0021-95177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcat.2019.08.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02912naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245008200170300001600252520163500268592002801903650004401931650001301975650002001988650001402008650002302022650000902045650001102054650001502065650001302080650001002093650001202103650001802115650001202133700001802145700002102163700001702184700002302201700003402224700003302258773008002291856008602371852000902457655001202466IND60085012520221116195936.0141101e201307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008501252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2013.02.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTian, Zhen-Yu10aTowards biofuel combustion with an easily extruded clay as a natural catalyst  ap. 149-156.  aThe present work aims to investigate an innovative application of natural clay as a catalyst for biofuel combustion. The mineralogical, chemical, thermal and textural characterizations of the natural clay suggest an intrinsic catalytic potential without any prior treatment. The catalytic performance was studied with respect to the combustion of n-butanol as a representative biofuel using different forms of the natural clay: fine powder, pressed pellets and extruded honeycomb monoliths. No major difference was found among these forms regarding texture, morphology and stability. In terms of performance, this clay proved competitive relative to cobalt oxide spinel, which is one of the most reactive non-noble transition metal oxides. The significant amount of naturally occurring transition metals such as iron and some elements considered as promoters in the clay were proposed to account for the catalytic properties. A systematic investigation of the catalytic performance of the clay as a function of the equivalence ratio and of the total flow rate was performed using gas-phase FTIR spectroscopy. Increase of the equivalence ratio at a fixed flow rate yielded a lower catalytic performance toward n-butanol combustion producing a consequent fraction of carbon monoxide and ethylene. At a constant equivalence ratio of 0.6, the performance of the clay was not affected by increasing the total inlet flow rate up to 30sccm. These findings may initiate the development of a new catalyst for biofuel combustion based on relatively low-cost and abundantly available raw materials such as the natural clay investigated here.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3abiofuels 3acarbon monoxide 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3aclay 3acobalt 3acombustion 3aethylene 3agases 3apellets 3araw materials 3atexture1 aChafik, Tarik1 aAssebban, Mhamed1 aHarti, Sanae1 aBahlawane, Naoufal1 aMountapmbeme Kouotou, Patrick1 aKohse-Höinghaus, Katharina,0 tApplied energy.g2013 July, v. 107 p.149-156dElsevier Ltdx0306-26197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2013.02.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02868naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245011500166300001600281520166900297592002801966650001601994650001102010650001602021650001402037650001002051650002202061650001702083650001202100650000902112650001802121650001202139650001402151650003902165650001802204700001802222700002002240773011602260856004802376961001302424852000902437655001202446IND50066458620221120035153.0130516e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006645862DNAL7 a10.1007/s11627-013-9506-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrown, Ryan H.10aUnintended consequences: high phosphinothricin acetyltransferase activity related to reduced fitness in barley  ap. 240-247.  aSelectable markers used in plant transformation, such as the bar gene, have been chosen for selection efficacy and for the absence of pleiotropic effects. Recent research has suggested that expression of bar in Arabidopsis affects the transcriptome, and in at least one barley cultivar, high bar expression has been associated with severe fitness reductions. However, the observed sensitivity in barley was thought to be an isolated case associated with a specific genetic stock. In this study, fitness reductions were observed in some near-isogenic lines in the background of the cultivar Garnet when the bar locus was homozygous. The fitness of the near-isogenic lines was correlated with the levels of bar mRNA in the donor parents. Previous studies had shown heritability of bar expression in F₁ barley hybrids, so these results suggested that Garnet barley is intolerant of high phosphinothricin acetyltransferase activity. Phosphinothricin acetyltransferase activities were determined for eight near-isogenic lines that showed a range of phenotypes (apparently normal to abnormal and nonviable) when homozygous for bar. Fitness was clearly and negatively correlated with phosphinothricin acetyltransferase activity. These results suggest genetic variability for sensitivity to bar expression in barley, and the possibility of negative but non-obvious effects in apparently tolerant cultivars cannot be ruled out. Similar problems may be associated, but not yet detected, with other selectable markers. The potential for pleiotropic effects of selectable markers can be avoided by transformation strategies that enable the elimination of selectable markers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3abarley 3acorrelation 3acultivars 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3aheritability 3ahybrids 3aloci 3amessenger RNA 3aparents 3aphenotype 3aphosphinothricin acetyltransferase 3atranscriptome1 aRaboy, Victor1 aBregitzer, Phil0 tIn vitro cellular & developmental biology.g2013 June, v. 49, no. 3 p.240-247dSpringer-Verlagx1054-54767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11627-013-9506-z  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02120naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005700146245014500203300001600348520109800364592002801462650002301490650002101513650001501534650002201549650002301571650001401594773013301608856008001741852000901821655001201830IND60680950520221121002237.0200110e20191212xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068095052DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b108602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aExner, Kai S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2934-607510aComparison of the Conventional Volcano Analysis with a Unifying Approach: Material Screening Based on a Combination of Experiment and Theory  ap. 822-828.  aMaterial screening in electrocatalysis has been spurred by the concept of volcano plots, which rely on analyzing binding energies at zero overpotential. Recently, a unifying material-screening approach was introduced by the author: the combination of first-principles calculations with a single experimental input parameter, that is, the threshold overpotential, at which the experimental Tafel slope exceeds 59 mV/dec in the respective class of materials, results in an ESSI-descriptor activity map. Therein, besides the analysis of binding energies, also the applied overpotential, decisive reaction intermediate, rate-determining reaction step, and electrochemical-step symmetry index (ESSI) are accounted for. On the example of the oxygen evolution reaction over RuO₂(110) surfaces, the two different frameworks are compared: while the conventional volcano method relies on a rough screening of the parameter space, as possibly promising surface configurations could be overlooked, the concept of ESSI-descriptor activity maps accounts for a more thorough sorting of electrode materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalytic activity 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aoxygen production 3aphysical chemistry 3ascreening0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2019 Dec. 12, v. 124, no. 1 p.822-828dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b108603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02786naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245018600170300001600356500001900372520141600391592002801807650001301835650001201848650001301860650001501873650000901888650001101897650001101908650000901919650001501928700002301943700002401966700002301990700002002013700002202033700002002055700002102075700002202096700002002118773011202138856008102250852000902331655001202340IND60711011220221120105226.0200915e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071101122DNAL7 a10.1134/S00978078200501642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPozdynakov, Sh.

The activity of more than eight hundreds of agricultural enterprises in the reservoir drainage basin was analyzed. Different types of underlying surface were classified with the use of space photographs. Mathematical simulation was used to calculate first the distributed agricultural nitrogen and phosphorus load onto the drainage basin and next the export of nutrients with river runoff into the reservoir either under current conditions or after the introduction of the best available technologies (BAT) to agricultural production. The simulations show that, under the conditions of medium water abundance, the total export from the drainage basins of the Sviyaga, Kazanka, Mesha, and Bol’shoi Cheremshan will decrease by about 367 t N/year and 12 t P/year after the introduction of BAT into the agricultural practice. The application of nitrogen and phosphorus into the soil as components of mineral and organic fertilizers in most administrative territories of the region under consideration was found to be less than the nutrient demand of agricultural crops, resulting in the gradual depletion of such elements in soils and a decrease in the risk of their migration into water bodies.  aPublisher supplied data 3adrainage 3aexports 3anitrogen 3aphosphorus 3arisk 3arivers 3arunoff 3asoil 3awatersheds1 aBriukhanov, A.

RESULTS: Ultrasound treatment could significantly reduce the usage of NaClO solution from 800 ppm to 500 ppm. NaClO‐US decreased the counts of E. coli, S. aureus and P. aeruginosa, which disrupted the bacterial cell membrane with cytoplasmic leakage. In addition, NaClO‐US significantly increased cell membrane permeability, while cell membrane integrity decreased, the secondary structure of bacterial proteins showed several obvious changes, such as the increase of random coil content, as well as the decrease of α‐helix content. The bacterial counts, E. coli, S. aureus and P. aeruginosa population in pakchoi treated with NaClO‐US reduced by 1.89, 1.40, 1.60, 1.72 log CFU g⁻¹, respectively compared to control sample after storage for 15 days. NaClO‐US resulted in minimum chlorophyll depletion, flavor and sensory deterioration. CONCLUSION: NaClO‐US solution treatment inhibited microorganisms and prolonged storage of pakchoi. © 2022 Society of Chemical Industry.  aPublisher supplied data  aJUFSTR20180205cNational First‐Class Discipline Program of Food Science and Technology  aFMZ202003cJiangsu Province Key Laboratory Project of Advanced Food Manufacturing Equipment and Technology  aBE2015310217cthe Jiangsu Province (China) Key Project in Agriculture  cNational Key R&D Program of China 3aBrassica rapa subsp. chinensis 3aBrassica rapa subsp. oleifera 3aEscherichia coli 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aagriculture 3aantibacterial properties 3abacteria 3acell membranes 3achlorophyll 3aflavor 3amembrane permeability 3asodium hypochlorite 3astorage time 3aultrasonic treatment 3aultrasonics1 aZhang, Min1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8107-52121 aMujumdar, Arun S.1 aLiu, Kun0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2022 Aug. 30, v. 102, no. 11 p.4685-4696dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.wJournal:jnl48536x0022-51427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.118293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02293naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001900146245007600165300001600241520123900257592002801496650001501524650001501539650003001554650001101584650001801595650002301613650001401636650001101650650001101661700006101672773013301733856008001866852000901946655001201955IND60680950620200331000000.0200110e20191216xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068095062DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b108982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchira, Romain10aOxidation-Induced Surface Plasmon Band Fragmentation in Silver Clusters  ap. 968-975.  aThe optical absorption of silver clusters is characterized by a strong plasmon band. However, most of the experimental photoabsorption measurements are performed on clusters interacting with a surrounding media, which can induce oxidation processes and possibly modify the optical properties. Here, we investigate the effects of oxygen adsorption onto the electronic structure and the optical properties of silver Agₙ (n = 8, 20, 38) clusters by using a well-established methodology based on the time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT). The presence of oxygen atoms on the silver cluster is found to induce fragmentation of the plasmon resonance that can lead to its disappearance and the onset of many excitations having a low plasmonic character. The broadening of the plasmon band is shown to depend not only on the number of oxygen atoms but also on their positions with respect to the cluster. The interaction of Ag₈ clusters with molecular O₂ is also examined. Our study can be used to analyze experimental measurements related to oxygen chemisorption or physisorption on metal clusters and can also be considered as a first step to model optical properties of noble metal nanoclusters embedded in oxide matrices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aadsorption 3adensity functional theory 3amodels 3ananoparticles 3aoptical properties 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3asilver1 aRabilloud, Franck1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5011-39490 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2019 Dec. 16, v. 124, no. 1 p.968-975dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b108983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01981naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245014000174300001600314500001900330520082000349592002801169650001401197650001101211650001201222651000901234651001601243653001701259653000801276653002201284653001501306653002501321700002401346700002401370773011901394856008501513852000901598655001201607IND60715447420221118052018.0201026e20201001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071544742DNAL7 a10.1080/09397140.2020.18051392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchwentner, Martin10aSome like it hot: Phallocryptus fahimii sp. n.

It is endemic to Iran and known only from its type locality in the Lut desert. The Lut desert has been designated the “Thermal pole of the Earth” with surface temperatures reaching up to 78.2°C. Shallow, ephemeral pools are filled by seasonal floods deriving from spring precipitations. Phallocryptus fahimii sp. n. is most closely related to the Mongolian P. tserensodnomi Alonso & Ventura, 2013. Males can be differentiated based on the relatively long frontal organ, the strong curvature of the labral distal process and the usual lack of a ventrolateral spine of the genital segment. http://www.zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:8F773751-A2D0-47DA-A8CD-0BB724EECB13  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnostraca 3aspring 3azoology 3aIran 3aMiddle East 0aBranchiopoda 0aCOI 0acryptic diversity 0aDesert Lut 0aintegrative taxonomy1 aRudov, Alexander V.1 aRajāyī, Ḥusayn,0 tZoology in the Middle East.g2020 Oct. 1, v. 66, no. 4 p.331-341dTaylor & FranciswJournal:19697x2326-26807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09397140.2020.18051393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03217naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006400148245015600212300001200368520168000380592002802060650001402088650002002102650002802122650002002150650002302170650002302193650002802216650002502244650002202269650001602291650001602307700007402323700005702397700006102454700006102515773015102576856008302727852000902810655001202819IND60768691320221116153414.0220513e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076869132DNAL7 a10.1007/s10661-022-09857-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAshley, Elizabeth A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3251-922110aDocumenting fishes in an inland sea with citizen scientist diver surveys: using taxonomic expertise to inform the observation potential of fish species  ap. 227.  aLong-term monitoring enables scientists and managers to track changes in the temporal and spatial distributions of fishes. Given the anthropogenic stressors affecting marine ecosystem health, there is a critical need for robust, comprehensive fish monitoring programs. Citizen science can serve as a meaningful, cost-effective strategy to survey fish communities. We compared data from 13,000 surveys collected over 21 years (1998–2019) by Reef Environmental Education Foundation (REEF) volunteer divers to a published compilation of Salish Sea ichthyofauna collected using an assortment of methods. Volunteer divers observed 138 of 261 recognized species in the Salish Sea, expanded the range of 18 species into additional Salish Sea sub-basins, and identified one species novel to the Salish Sea (Gibbonsia metzi — Striped Kelpfish). To identify Salish Sea fish species that are most suitable to be monitored by underwater visual census and to evaluate confidence in in situ identification, we developed a categorization system based on the likelihood of recreational divers and snorkelers encountering a given species, and on whether identification required a specimen in hand or could be classified to species visually (with or without a high-quality photograph). REEF divers encountered 62% (138 of 223) of the visually detectable species occurring in the region and 85% (102 of 120) of species most likely to be observed by recreational divers. Our findings show that citizen scientists provide valuable monitoring data for over half of the 261 marine and anadromous fish species known to occupy the Salish Sea, many of which are not routinely monitored otherwise.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGibbonsia 3aanadromous fish 3aanthropogenic stressors 3acitizen science 3acitizen scientists 3acost effectiveness 3aenvironmental education 3aenvironmental health 3amarine ecosystems 3amarine fish 3aphotographs1 aPattengill-Semmens, Christy V.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5255-60331 aOrr, James W.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6631-90871 aNichols, Janna D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6421-27961 aGaydos, Joseph K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6599-87970 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2022 Mar., v. 194, no. 3 p.227-227dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl33242x0167-63697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-022-09857-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03311naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005700148245019400205300001400399520176800413592002802181650001602209650001902225650001902244650001902263650001302282650002002295650002202315650002802337650002702365650002602392650001802418650001302436650002402449650001902473650001402492650001802506650001402524650001702538650001402555650001202569651001002581700001802591700001502609773010202624856008202726852000902808655001202817IND60682694220221119195209.0200130e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068269422DNAL7 a10.1007/s12355-019-00737-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTayade, A.

The soil of the experimental site was clay loam in texture, taxonomically classified as typic haplustalf, low in organic carbon, medium in available N, P and fairly high in available K, slightly alkaline in reaction with normal electrical conductivity. The results revealed that, with highest profitability (304,110.5 and 129,066.0 Rs ha⁻¹ net returns in plant crop and ratoon crops) and moderate partial factor productivity and agronomic efficiency of fertilizer NPK, STCR 150 + 10 t FYM + biofertilizer nutrient management module in plant crop and 20 t FYM + STCR 150 module in ratoon crop hold great promise in meeting the growing nutrient demands of intensive sugarcane agriculture. It also recorded higher sugarcane productivity (186.46 t ha⁻¹ and 111.15 t ha⁻¹ cane yield in plant and ratoon crops), better juice quality and improvement in soil health. Based on the results of 3-year field experiments, it is concluded that the application of 10 t ha⁻¹ FYM + STCR 150-based fertilizers (390 kg N ha⁻¹ and 94 kg P ha⁻¹) + biofertilizers in plant crop and application of 20 t ha⁻¹ FYM + STCR 150 (390 kg N ha⁻¹, 94 kg P ha⁻¹ and 117 kg K ha⁻¹) in ratoon crop can be recommended for sustaining soil health, sugarcane productivity and profitability under tropical Indian conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHaplustalfs 3aagroecosystems 3aanimal manures 3abiofertilizers 3abreeding 3aclay loam soils 3acosts and returns 3aelectrical conductivity 3afertilizer application 3afield experimentation 3ajuice quality 3anitrogen 3anutrient management 3aorganic carbon 3apotassium 3aprofitability 3aratooning 3asoil quality 3asugarcane 3atexture 3aIndia1 aBhaskaran, A.1 aAnusha, S.0 tSugar tech.g2020 Feb., v. 22, no. 1 p.32-41dSpringer IndiawJournal:J000000155x0972-15257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12355-019-00737-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03086naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001800155245017900173520153400352592002801886650001501914650002101929650001501950650001201965650001601977650001601993650001602009650002202025650001402047650002302061650003102084650001102115650001102126650001602137650001502153650001702168650001602185650002502201651001202226653001902238653001402257653001402271653002102285700006402306700002002370773009102390856009002481852000902571655001202580IND60758334820221123044504.0220205e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075833482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1330452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHwang, Hyewon12aA study on activation mechanism in perspective of lignin structures and applicability of lignin-derived activated carbons for pollutant absorbent and supercapacitor electrode  aIn this study activated carbons were produced from the biorefinery waste lignin (Asian lignin (AL) USA & Inbicon lignin (IL) Denmark) to evaluate their potential in waste water treatment and as energy storage devices. These products were studied for their surface characteristics as a function of reaction temperature, time, and catalyst loading accordingly. Under the conditions with a temperature lower than 750 °C and within a reaction time of 1 h, the catalytic reaction of alkali-carbon bonding occurred from the external surface, and a turbostratic disorder structure with a large aromatic ring system was formed. More severe reaction conditions accelerated the volatile release of de-alkylated aromatics such as benzene and naphthalene, along with structure and surface collapse. The maximum BET surface area of 2782 m²/g was obtained at 750 °C, 2 h and catalyst ratio of 4. Lignin-derived activated carbon was more efficient for the removal of organic pollutants (<50% adsorption capacity) rather than heavy metals (adsorption capacity >90%) due to interaction of π-π bonding. Furthermore, the activated carbon has a potential to be used as a supercapacitor electrode with high specific capacitance (214.0 F/g AL lignin) and an excellent cyclic stability (95% of their initial capacity). The results of this study demonstrate that lignin is an attractive precursor to produce activated carbons with diverse applications both as biosorbent and as a carbon electrode material even so with acceptable performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorbents 3aactivated carbon 3aadsorption 3abenzene 3abiorefining 3abiosorbents 3acapacitance 3acarbon electrodes 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3aelectrochemical capacitors 3aenergy 3alignin 3anaphthalene 3apollutants 3asurface area 3atemperature 3awastewater treatment 3aDenmark 0aCarbon surface 0aAdsorbent 0aElectrode 0aCyclic stability1 aAjaz, Ahmed Muhammad1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8756-88351 aChoi, Joon Weon0 tChemosphere.g2022 Mar., v. 291 p.133045-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1330453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03890naa a2200745 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002000153245011600173300001600289520179700305592002802102650001202130650001602142650001202158650001802170650001702188650002202205650001702227650001202244650001202256650001902268650002002287650001102307650001802318650001302336650002302349650002302372650001502395650002202410650001902432650001502451650001602466650001702482650001802499650001402517650001402531650001302545650001102558651002302569651001102592653002402603653001902627653001402646653001402660653001702674653001402691653002302705700002502728700002602753700002602779700002302805700002702828700002502855700001902880700002402899700002502923773008802948856008703036852000903123655001203132IND60581439220221117213037.0171005e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058143922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.earscirev.2016.09.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPáez-Osuna, F.10aEnvironmental status of the Gulf of California: A review of responses to climate change and climate variability  ap. 253-268.  aThe Gulf of California (GC) is a unique large marine ecosystem characterized by its rich biodiversity, high biological productivity and endemism of marine life, which are the basis of Mexico's most important fisheries. However, as many other large ecosystems worldwide, it is subject to diverse anthropogenic pressures (overfishing, losses of biodiversity and habitats, pollution, climate variability and climate change (CC)). We reviewed over 180 studies dealing with the impacts of CC and climate variability in the GC region. Main issues on the impact of ENSO events, acidification, sea level rise, and water availability are discussed for the GC in a global context. Impacts of ENSO events on the GC are geographically heterogeneous, upwelling tends to be suppressed, and this in turn influences the distribution and abundance of marine mammals, fishes, shrimps, benthic species, seaweeds and phytoplankton. ENSO events strongly impact small pelagic fishes, key components of the GC ecosystem, thus affecting fisheries in general as well as non-harvested species such as marine mammals and sea birds. Probably the most well-known phenomenon associated to ENSO impact in the GC is coral bleaching, a process by which corals expel most of their microalgal endosymbionts to become pale or white (bleached). Beside shifts in the distributional limits of benthic organisms, invasions of alien species are also occuring. Harmful algal blooms (HABs) are common and recurrent in the GC. Fourteen HAB-forming species have been recorded, with Gymnodinium catenatum being the most frequent. HABs are inhibited by El Niño and promoted by La Niña. During El Niño events the size and biomass of macroalgal blooms tend to decrease. Finally, several aspects that require further research are proposed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEl Nino 3aGymnodinium 3aLa Nina 3aacidification 3aalgal blooms 3abenthic organisms 3abiodiversity 3abiomass 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3acoral bleaching 3acorals 3aendosymbionts 3ahabitats 3aindigenous species 3aintroduced species 3amacroalgae 3amarine ecosystems 3amarine mammals 3amicroalgae 3aoverfishing 3apelagic fish 3aphytoplankton 3apollution 3asea level 3aseabirds 3ashrimp 3aGulf of California 3aMexico 0aClimate variability 0aClimate change 0aBleaching 0aInvasions 0aAlgal blooms 0aFisheries 0aGulf of California1 aSanchez-Cabeza, J.A.1 aRuiz-Fernández, A.C.1 aAlonso-Rodríguez, R.1 aPiñón-Gimate, A.1 aCardoso-Mohedano, J.G.1 aFlores-Verdugo, F.J.1 aCarballo, J.L.1 aCisneros-Mata, M.A.1 aÁlvarez-Borrego, S.0 tEarth-science reviews.g2016 Nov., v. 162 p.253-268dElsevier B.V.x0012-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.earscirev.2016.09.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02500naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245007100171300001600242520100600258592002801264650001301292650001601305650002701321650001801348650001901366650002101385650001701406650001801423650004401441650001601485650003701501650001601538653002701554653002001581653002301601653001701624653001801641653001501659700001801674700002301692700001901715700001701734700001701751700002401768773010601792856008701898852000901985655001201994IND60581212820221118133801.0180914e20171101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058121282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfb.2017.07.0552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNoro, Jennifer10aOil-based cyclo-oligosaccharide nanodevices for drug encapsulation  ap. 259-267.  aNew encapsulation nanodevices were synthesized by emulsification of cyclo-oligosaccharides fully substituted by hydrophobic palmitic chains. These highly hydrophobic compounds, acquire oily-like behaviour at moderate temperatures (∼50°C) and when submitted to ultrasound (US) can undergo emulsification. The improved emulsifying properties of modified cyclo-oligosaccharides are suitable to produce small and narrow sized nanoemulsions with ability to encapsulate amphiphilic molecules. Both encapsulation and delivery of a therapeutic drug, methotrexate (MTX), with amphiphilic character was assessed. The physicochemical properties of the cyclo-oligosaccharide nanoemulsions containing MTX were investigated by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and dynamic light scattering (DLS). The results revealed that the modified cyclo-oligosaccharides are potential platforms for the encapsulation of bio compounds for cosmetic and pharmaceutical purposes.  aPublisher supplied data 3acolloids 3aemulsifying 3aemulsifying properties 3aencapsulation 3ahydrophobicity 3alight scattering 3amethotrexate 3ananoemulsions 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3atemperature 3atransmission electron microscopy 3aultrasonics 0aCyclo-oligosaccharides 0aCyclosophoraose 0aPalmitoyl chloride 0aPhase-change 0aNanoemulsions 0aUltrasound1 aLoureiro, Ana1 aGonçalves, Filipa1 aAzoia, Nuno G.1 aJung, Seunho1 aSilva, Carla1 aCavaco-Paulo, Artur0 tColloids and surfaces.g2017 Nov. 01, v. 159 p.259-267dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11946x0927-77657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2017.07.0553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04055naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100006100149245016400210520222200374592002802596650003902624650001502663650001802678650001802696650001802714650002202732650001502754650001502769650001902784650002002803650002402823650001302847650000902860650001402869650001002883651001602893651001202909653002902921653002502950653001102975653001902986653003603005653001203041700006003053700006203113700005703175700005803232700002203290773010803312856008403420852000903504655001203513IND60737487720221121044432.0220205e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073748772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.still.2021.1050672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYigezu, Yigezu A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9156-708210aCan an incremental approach be a better option in the dissemination of conservation agriculture? Some socioeconomic justifications from the drylands of Morocco  aDespite several efforts for its dissemination, adoption of conservation agriculture (CA) in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region is low – causing some to wonder if an incremental approach for adoption of its three components would prove more effective. In this paper, we apply the endogenous switching regression model to a nationally representative sample of 1901 wheat fields in Morocco to analyze the impacts of partial or full adoption of all three components of the CA system. We also employ an ordered probit model to identify the determinants of partial and full adoption of CA. Model results show that adoption of the complete CA system leads to 307 kg/ha (35 %) higher yields, US$99/ha (44 %) higher gross margins, and 23 kg/capita/year (38 %) more consumption of wheat relative to the conventional system. Our results also show that adoption of only two principles of the CA system leads to higher benefits in all the livelihood indicators listed above compared to adoption of only one or none of the principles. Likewise, adoption of only one principle is more beneficial than the conventional system. Along with biophysical and environmental benefits documented elsewhere, our results demonstrate that the CA system can provide large economic, social, and food security benefits both at individual household and national levels. Therefore, wider diffusion of the full CA system involving zero tillage (ZT), crop rotation, and crop residue retention has potential to sustainably improve the viability of agriculture in the drylands of Morocco and other similar countries in the MENA region. Given that the CA system is complex and knowledge-intensive, transition from the conventional system to CA requires the following: (1) flexibility to let farmers incrementally adopt one or more of the CA components, learn at their own pace, use some of the benefits, and improve it over time to exploit the full potential of the CA system with close follow-up and technical support from experts and extension specialists; and (2) sustained policy and institutional supports that provide incentives for farmers to adopt and for the private sector to be actively involved, especially in service provision.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural conservation practice 3aarid lands 3acrop residues 3acrop rotation 3afood security 3aissues and policy 3alivelihood 3ano-tillage 3aprivate sector 3aprobit analysis 3aregression analysis 3aresearch 3asoil 3aviability 3awheat 3aMiddle East 3aMorocco 0aConservation agriculture 0aIncremental approach 0aImpact 0aOrdered probit 0aEndogenous switching regression 0aMorocco1 aEl-Shater, Tamer1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0698-689X1 aBoughlala, Mohamed1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1635-73141 aDevkota, Mina1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2348-48161 aMrabet, Rachid1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0311-193X1 aMoussadek, Rachid0 tSoil & tillage research.g2021 Aug., v. 212 p.105067-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl32961x0167-19877nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.still.2021.1050673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01385naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001400149245007200163300001800235520043400253592002800687650001400715650002800729650001100757700001700768700001800785700001600803700005100819773012000870856008400990852000901074655001201083IND60769255120221118070024.0220304e20220221xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076925512DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.2c001592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Rong10aConstruction of the Tetracyclic Core Structure of Dysiherbols A–C  ap. 1642-1646.  aA synthetic study on the construction of the tetracyclic core structure of dysiherbols A–C is presented herein.

They were fed either a commercial diet or an arsenic-supplemented diet containing 7.5, 15 or 30 mg/kg As₂O₃. The experiment lasted for 90 days and the samples of muscular tissues were collected at 30, 60 and 90 days. The results showed that As₂O₃ exposure significantly lowered the activities of antioxidant enzymes (catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px)) and inhibition ability of hydroxyl radicals (OH) and increased the malondialdehyde (MDA) contents. Furthermore, the mRNA levels of inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), inducible NO synthase (iNOS), prostaglandin E synthase (PTGEs)) and heat shock proteins (HSPs) in muscular tissue were significantly upregulated in the As₂O₃ exposure groups. The results indicated that As₂O₃ exposure resulted in oxidative damage, induced the inflammatory response, and influenced the mRNA levels of HSPs in muscular tissue of cocks. Additionally, the results suggested that HSPs possibly resisted due to the As₂O₃ exposure-induced oxidative stress and inflammatory response, which provided a favorable environment and played protective roles in the muscular tissues of cocks. The information presented in this study is helpful to understand the mechanism of As₂O₃ toxicity in bird muscular tissues.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarsenic 3acatalase 3adiet 3aenzyme activity 3aglutathione peroxidase 3aheat shock proteins 3ahydroxyl radicals 3ainducible nitric oxide synthase 3ainflammation 3amalondialdehyde 3amessenger RNA 3aoxidative stress 3aprostaglandin synthase 3aprostaglandins 3aprotective effect 3aroosters 3atissues 3atoxicity 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha1 aGuo, Ying1 aHe, Ying1 aSun, Xiao1 aZhao, Hong-jing1 aWang, Yu1 aWang, Ya-jun1 aXing, Ming-wei0 tEcotoxicology.g2017 Oct., v. 26, no. 8 p.1078-1088dSpringer USx0963-92927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10646-017-1835-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03581naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245015400170300001600324520177200340592002802112650002302140650001702163650002202180650002102202650001302223650001102236650001702247650001802264650001702282650002002299650001402319650001702333650001302350650001102363650001102374650000902385650002102394650004002415650001102455653001302466653002502479653001402504653003502518653003102553700001702584700001302601700001502614700002002629700001702649700001502666700001902681700002102700700001502721700001702736773010602753856008702859852000902946655001202955IND60581212920221118133802.0180914e20171101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058121292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfb.2017.07.0572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Jinhai10aCombination of dexamethasone and Avastin® by supramolecular hydrogel attenuates the inflammatory corneal neovascularization in rat alkali burn model  ap. 241-250.  aCorneal neovascularization (CNV) is one of the leading causes of vision loss and a high-risk factor for transplant rejection. The present study proposed a supramolecular hydrogel comprised of MPEG-PCL micelles and α-cyclodextrin (α-CD) for co-delivery of dexamethasone sodium phosphate (Dexp) and Avastin® (Ava), and further evaluated its therapeutic efficacy in rat alkali burn model. A physical mixing of Dexp/Ava, MPEG-PCL micelles, and α-CD aqueous solution leads to a spontaneous formation of the supramolecular hydrogel via a “host-guest” recognition between MPEG and α-CD. The supramolecular hydrogel provides a relatively quick release of Dexp over Ava during the study of the 5-day in vitro release. The results of in vitro cytotoxicity test and wound healing assay illustrated that the proposed supramolecular hydrogel was non-toxic against L-929 and HCEC cells and did not significantly affect the migration of HCEC cells after 24h incubation. The corneal distribution test suggested that the precorneal duration of Ava was significantly extended by the supramolecular hydrogel with respect to its solution formulation. Moreover, the supramolecular hydrogel showed high ocular biocompatibility and was a non-irritant after topical instillation. Furthermore, the Dexp-Ava hydrogel medication, but not by Ava solution and Ava hydrogel medication, could greatly attenuate the alkali burn-induced corneal inflammation and remarkably suppress the corneal neovascularization via the downregulation of VEGF, CD31, and α-SMA expression in the rat alkali burn model. As a result, the combined Dexp and Ava by supramolecular hydrogel exhibited an advantage over Ava monotherapy approach, which might be a promising alternative therapy for inflammatory CNV.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalpha-cyclodextrin 3aangiogenesis 3aaqueous solutions 3abiocompatibility 3acolloids 3acornea 3acytotoxicity 3adexamethasone 3adrug therapy 3agraft rejection 3ahydrogels 3ainflammation 3amicelles 3amixing 3amodels 3arats 3asodium phosphate 3avascular endothelial growth factors 3avision 0aHydrogel 0aOcular drug delivery 0aAvastin® 0aDexamethasone sodium phosphate 0aCorneal neovascularization1 aWang, Wenwen1 aYu, Jing1 aYu, Xinxin1 aZheng, Qianqian1 aPeng, Fangli1 aHe, Zhifen1 aZhao, Wenguang1 aZhang, Zhaoliang1 aLi, Xingyi1 aWang, Qinmei0 tColloids and surfaces.g2017 Nov. 01, v. 159 p.241-250dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11946x0927-77657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2017.07.0573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03543naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006200151245011300213300001800326520217700344592002802521650002402549650001902573650001802592650001802610650001902628650002202647650001602669650001302685650001702698653002002715653001702735653001102752700005702763700006802820700006402888773009802952856008603050852000903136655001203145IND60678435820221119022129.0200330e20200205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067843582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2019.12.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNnaji, Chukwudi A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4132-192210aImmunogenicity and safety of fractional dose yellow fever vaccination: A systematic review and meta-analysis  ap. 1291-1301.  aRecent upsurges in yellow fever outbreaks are increasing the demand for yellow fever vaccine, while enormously straining global vaccine supply. Fractional dose yellow fever vaccination is being considered as a dose-sparing strategy to address current vaccine shortages. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to assess the effects of fractional dose yellow fever vaccination, in comparison with those of standard dose vaccination.We registered this review on the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO, registration number: CRD42018084214), developed the protocol in line with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses Protocols (PRISMA-P) and synthesised the evidence in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). We stratified meta-analyses by vaccine dose.We retrieved 2524 records from the literature search, eleven of them potentially eligible. From these studies, we included eight eligible trials, with a total of 2371 participants. Seroconversion rates at four to five weeks following vaccination were similar between participants who received standard doses and participants who received fractional doses containing one-third (547 participants: risk ratio [RR] 1.02, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.00–1.04), one-fifth (155 participants: RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.98–1.03), one-tenth (890 participants: RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.96–1.01), and one-fiftieth (661 participants: RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.92–1.02) of the standard dose. However, the rates of seroconversion were substantially lower among participants who received fractional doses containing one-hundredth and lower fractions of the standard dose. Immunogenicity similarly persisted 8–10 years following both fractional and standard dose vaccination. Minor adverse events following vaccination did not differ across doses, and no serious adverse events were reported in any study arm.These findings support the use of fractional dosing as a strategy for mitigating vaccine shortages. The strategy should be specifically considered for individuals who are young, immuno-competent and well nourished.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconfidence interval 3aimmunogenicity 3ameta-analysis 3arelative risk 3aseroconversion 3asystematic review 3avaccination 3avaccines 3ayellow fever 0aFractional dose 0aDose-sparing 0aSafety1 aShey, Muki S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8776-47371 aAdetokunboh, Olatunji O.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4608-39511 aWiysonge, Charles S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1273-47790 tVaccine.g2020 Feb. 05, v. 38, no. 6 p.1291-1301dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2019.12.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01470naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001800188245011800206300001300324500002200337506007600359520011100435592002800546506003700574650001600611650001300627650001100640650002500651700006300676700002500739700002200764700002000786700001700806700002000823773013800843856008200981852000901063655001201072IND60609078920221207140322.0180904e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060907892DNAL7 a10.1007/s00394-018-1761-72doi7 aPMC61052572pmcid7 a299783792pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWarren, Janet10aCorrection to: Challenges in the assessment of total fluid intake in children and adolescents: a discussion paper  ap. 2311.  aPublished Erratum  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn the original publication of the article, a mistake was introduced in affiliation of Dr. Michael Nelson.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadolescents 3achildren 3afluids 3anutrition assessment1 aGuelinckx, Isabelle1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4776-94531 aLivingstone, Barbara1 aPotischman, Nancy1 aNelson, Michael1 aFoster, Emma1 aHolmes, Bridget0 tEuropean journal of nutrition.g2018 Sept., v. 57, no. 6 p.2311-2311dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3949855x1436-62077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00394-018-1761-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03090naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002600152245012100178300001600299500001900315520142800334592002801762650001501790650001501805650002101820650001601841650001401857650001301871650001701884650002201901650001101923650001201934650001901946650001801965650001401983650001301997650002102010650001102031650001902042650002202061650002002083650002002103653002402123653003302147700002502180700002302205700002502228700003202253700002002285773013502305856008702440852000902527655001202536IND60732770120221117170605.0210603e20210630xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073277012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2021.03.1172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarciano, Jéssica S.10aBiodegradable gelatin composite hydrogels filled with cellulose for chromium (VI) adsorption from contaminated water  ap. 112-124.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aBiopolymers are promising materials for water treatment applications due to their abundance, low cost, expandability, and chemical structure. In this work, gelatin hydrogels filled with cellulose in the form of pristine eucalyptus residues (PER) or treated eucalyptus residues (TER) were prepared for adsorption and chromium removal in contaminated water. PER is a lignocellulosic compound, with cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin, while TER has cellulose as a major component. FT-Raman Spectroscopy and FTIR analysis confirmed the crosslink reaction with glutaraldehyde and indicated that fillers altered the gelatin molecular vibrations and formed new hydrogen bonds, impacting the hydrogels' crystalline structure. The hydrogen bond energy was altered by the cellulosic fillers' addition and resulted in higher thermal stability (~10 °C). Hydrogels presented a Fickian diffusion, where gelatin hydrogel showed the highest swelling ability (466%), and composites showed lower values with the filler content increase. The chromium adsorption capacity presented values between 12 and 13 mg/g, i.e., featuring an excellent removal capacity which is related with hydrogel crosslinked structure and fibers surface hydroxyl groups, highlighting gelatin hydrogel TER 5% with better removal capacity. The developed hydrogels were produced from biomacromolecules with low-cost and potential application in contaminated water.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEucalyptus 3aadsorption 3abiodegradability 3abiopolymers 3acellulose 3achromium 3acrosslinking 3acrystal structure 3aenergy 3agelatin 3aglutaraldehyde 3ahemicellulose 3ahydrogels 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen bonding 3alignin 3alignocellulose 3athermal stability 3awater pollution 3awater treatment 0aComposite hydrogels 0aContaminated water treatment1 aFerreira, Rafaela R.1 ade Souza, Alana G.1 aBarbosa, Rennan F.S.1 ade Moura Junior, Antonio J.1 aRosa, Derval S.0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2021 June 30, v. 181 p.112-124dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2021.03.1173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02474naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245017400166300001600340520107200356592002801428596006101456596005901517650002401576650000801600650002501608650001601633650001001649650002701659650001201686650001601698650002401714650001601738700002101754700005801775700002101833773013001854856008301984852000902067655001202076IND60762846320221121081217.0220115e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076284632DNAL7 a10.1007/s13197-021-05023-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSuri, Kanchan10aInfluence of dry air and infrared pre-treatments on oxidative stability, Maillard reaction products and other chemical properties of linseed (Linum usitatissimum L.) oil  ap. 366-376.  aIn this study, the influence of dry air and infrared pre-treatments on linseed oil (LO) yield, chemical properties, colour, pigment content, total phenolic content (TPC), Maillard reaction products (MRPs), fatty acid composition (FAC), radical scavenging activity (RSA), and oxidative stability index (OSI) were investigated. An increase in dry air and infrared roasting temperature had increased the LO yield, pigment content, a* value, TPC, RSA, OSI, and browning index (BI) while lowered the L* and b* values of LO. Higher OSI (2.24 h), chlorophylls (2.29 mg/kg), carotenoids (3.87 mg/kg), TPC (63.67 mg GAE/100 g), RSA (62.53%), BI (0.330), and MRPs (2.10 mg/kg) were detected in LO by dry air roasting at 180°C for 10 min. Dry air and infrared roasting had slightly affected the FAC of LO. Both dry air and infrared pre-treatments had influenced the LO quality characteristics. However, dry air roasting of linseed at 180°C for 10 min proved more effective in improving oxidative stability, antioxidant activity and other quality characteristics of LO.  aPublisher supplied data  aSB/EMEQ-037/2014cScience and Engineering Research Board  aSB/WEA/09/2017cScience and Engineering Research Board 3aLinum usitatissimum 3aair 3aantioxidant activity 3acarotenoids 3acolor 3afatty acid composition 3alinseed 3alinseed oil 3aoxidative stability 3atemperature1 aSingh, Balwinder1 aKaur, Amritpal1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2976-99401 aSingh, Narpinder0 tJournal of food science and technology.g2022 Jan., v. 59, no. 1 p.366-376dSpringer IndiawJournal:jnl16929x0022-11557nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13197-021-05023-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02788naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245014900164520130600313592002801619650002001647650002101667650002501688650001701713650001701730650001701747650001301764650001801777650001701795650001401812653001701826653002001843653001201863653001801875653002601893653000801919653000801927653000901935653000801944653000701952653001101959653000801970653000901978700002201987700002602009700002302035773012202058856008102180852000902261655001202270IND60708087120221121230600.0211030e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070808712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2020.1100952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRokosik, Ewa10aAntioxidant activity and synergism of canolol and α-tocopherol in rapeseed oil is affected by the presence of phospholipid association colloids  aInteractions of canolol and α-tocopherol (α-T) with reverse micelles made from DOPC phospholipid (1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) in rapeseed oil were investigated in the current study. Furthermore, the antioxidant efficiency of canolol and α-T as well as the phenomenon of synergism between them in the oil containing association colloids has been determined. As demonstrated by fluorescence measurements, canolol may be incorporated into the structure of DOPC reverse micelles. This antioxidant may also accumulate in bulk oil at oil/water interface. In turn, no interactions of α-T with phospholipid association colloids were observed.The presence of DOPC association colloids affects antioxidant efficiency of canolol and α-T. Simultaneously, at the concentration 100 μmol of both substances, decreasing of their antioxidant activity effectiveness over time was observed. Formed during autoxidation amphiphilic compounds probably influence the structure of reverse micelles, modifying effectiveness of antioxidants. Antioxidant synergism of canolol and α-T occurs only in DOPC reverse micelles. Synergism phenomenon allows eliminating adverse effect of autoxidation products on the effectiveness of antioxidants. The presence of canolol may eliminate prooxidative action of α-T.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3aalpha-tocopherol 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3aautoxidation 3afluorescence 3amicelles 3aphospholipids 3arapeseed oil 3asynergism 0aRapeseed oil 0aReverse micelle 0aCanolol 0aα-tocopherol 0aAntioxidant synergism 0aCan 0aCMC 0aDOPC 0aIox 0akq 0aNBD-PE 0aSyn 0aα-T1 aSiger, Aleksander1 aRudzińska, Magdalena1 aDwiecki, Krzysztof0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2020 Nov., v. 133 p.110095-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2020.1100953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02763naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005600148245007200204300001600276520147300292592002801765650002001793650001501813650001001828650002401838650001001862650001301872650001301885650002001898650002401918650002201942650001701964650002301981650001702004650001802021700002302039700002402062700003302086773013002119856008302249852000902332655001202341IND60762846420221121062508.0220115e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076284642DNAL7 a10.1007/s13197-021-05016-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAyoubi, Azam1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7483-098810aFortified cake with pomegranate seed powder as a functional product  ap. 308-316.  aPomegranate seed as a by-product of the pomegranate juice processing industry contains a range of valuable pharmaceutical and nutritional compounds. It’s application as a food supplement leads to enhancement of the nutritional value and healthy properties of final products. In this research, various levels (2.5, 5, 7.5, and 10%) of pomegranate seed powder (PSP) were used in the cupcake formula and their effects on the physicochemical, sensorial, and microbial properties of the final product were evaluated during 28 days of storage at 4 °C. Adding PSP to the cupcake formula significantly increased the protein, fat, and fiber contents of the product (p < 0.05) but did not affect the oxidative stability of cupcakes during the storage time. The PSP increased the hardness of the cupcake. It was also effective in maintaining the moisture content of the product during the storage time. The results indicated that the specific volume, lightness, and yellowness of crust and crumb were decreased by increasing the level of PSP, while the redness of crumb was increased. Besides, the results of the sensory evaluation showed the addition of PSP up to 5% to cupcake formula did not have a significant negative effect on the sensory characteristics of the product. It could be concluded that the PSP could be used in cupcake formulation up to 5% as a flour replacement for nutritional and functional enrichment of cake without adverse effect on cake quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3abyproducts 3acakes 3adietary supplements 3aflour 3ahardness 3aindustry 3anutritive value 3aoxidative stability 3apomegranate juice 3apomegranates 3asensory evaluation 3astorage time 3awater content1 aBalvardi, Mohammad1 aAkhavan, Hamid-Reza1 aHajimohammadi-Farimani, Reza0 tJournal of food science and technology.g2022 Jan., v. 59, no. 1 p.308-316dSpringer IndiawJournal:jnl16929x0022-11557nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13197-021-05016-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02635naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100001800180245007100198300001800269506007600287520126100363592002801624506003701652650003501689650000801724650002101732650002301753650003901776650002401815650001901839650001201858650004401870650003101914700002301945700002401968700002601992773011102018856007502129852000902204655001202213IND60529529620221207101242.0160717e20131015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052952962DNAL7 a10.1021/ac402038t2doi7 aPMC38550372pmcid7 a239874742pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Janghyun10aInfluence of Dimethylsulfoxide on RNA Structure and Ligand Binding  ap. 9692-9698.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aDimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) is widely used as a cosolvent to solubilize hydrophobic compounds in RNA-ligand binding assays. Although it is known that high concentrations of DMSO (>75%) can significantly affect RNA structure and folding energetics, a thorough analysis of how lower concentrations (<10%) of DMSO typically used in binding assays affects RNA structure and ligand binding has not been undertaken. Here, we use NMR and 2-aminopurine fluorescence spectroscopy to examine how DMSO affects the structure, dynamics, and ligand binding properties of two flexible hairpin RNAs: the transactivation response element from HIV-1 and bacterial ribosomal A-site. In both cases, 5–10% DMSO decreased stacking interactions and increased local disorder in noncanonical residues within bulges and loops and resulted in 0.3–4-fold reduction in the measured binding affinities for different small molecules, with the greatest reduction observed for an intercalating compound that binds RNA nonspecifically. Our results suggest that, by competing for hydrophobic interactions, DMSO can have a small but significant effect on RNA structure and ligand binding. These effects should be considered when developing ligand binding assays and high throughput screens.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aHuman immunodeficiency virus 1 3aRNA 3abinding capacity 3adimethyl sulfoxide 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3ahydrophobic bonding 3ahydrophobicity 3aligands 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3atranscriptional activation1 aVogt, Catherine E.1 aMcBrairty, Mitchell1 aAl-Hashimi, Hashim M.0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2013 Oct. 15, v. 85, no. 20 p.9692-9698dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fac402038t3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02543naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100001900191245008700210300001600297506007600313520106300389592002801452506003701480650001101517650001001528650001901538650001101557650001501568650000901583650000901592650001801601650002301619650002401642650000901666651001001675653003001685653001301715653002201728653001401750700002001764700001901784700001901803700003001822773012501852856005101977852000902028655001202037IND50076118420221207064627.0140410e20120201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007611842DNAL7 a10.1080/02772248.2011.6280012doi7 aPMC58024202pmcid7 a294300742pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Jianghong10aLow blood lead levels and hemoglobin concentrations in preschool children in China  ap. 423-426.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIt is well known that lead (Pb) produces reduced haemoglobin (Hb) levels and risk of anemia when blood lead levels (BPb) are greater than 20 µg dL⁻¹. Two recent studies reported an increased risk of anemia in children with BPb between 10–20 µg dL⁻¹, but few studies examined the association between Hb levels or risk of anemia and BPb under 10 µg dL⁻¹. In the present study this association was examined using data of 140 preschool children from a larger prospective cohort study in China. Data showed that compared to children with BPb <5 µg dL⁻¹, children with BPb between 7.5–10 µg dL⁻¹ had significantly lower Hb levels, but there were no marked differences for other groups. A linear regression model showed a negative relationship between BPb and Hb levels after controlling for age, gender, height, weight, and iron (Fe) deficiency. This finding, although limited by a small sample size, suggests it may be important to examine Pb-induced hemosynthesis effect at concentrations less than 10 µg dL⁻¹.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanemia 3ablood 3acohort studies 3agender 3ahemoglobin 3airon 3alead 3alinear models 3apreschool children 3aregression analysis 3arisk 3aChina 0aanemia; blood lead levels 0achildren 0aChina; hemoglobin 0apreschool1 aMcCauley, Linda1 aYan, Chonghuai1 aShen, Xiaoming1 aPinto-Martin, Jennifer A.0 tToxicological and environmental chemistry.g2012 Feb. 1, v. 94, no. 2 p.423-426dTaylor & Francis Groupx1029-04867nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02772248.2011.628001  aDNAL 7aarticle03177naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100001800169245007000187300001600257520129000273592002801563650002701591650002001618650001001638650002201648650001401670650001001684650001301694650000801707650001801715650001401733650002201747650001101769650001201780650001201792650001001804650007301814650004301887650001301930650008601943650006602029650002802095650003702123651001002160651002502170653002702195653002002222653002902242653001402271700001502285700001902300700001702319700001602336773011702352856008502469852000902554655001202563IND50060453020221120062031.0190403e20130222xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006045302DNAL7 a231461692pmid7 a10.1016/j.vetmic.2012.10.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDong, Chuanfu10aEmergence of fatal European genotype CyHV-3/KHV in mainland China  ap. 239-244.  aCyprinid herpesvirus 3 (CyHV-3), also known as koi herpesvirus (KHV), is a highly infectious causative agent to common carp and koi worldwide. The virus is mainly consisted of European and Asian genotype isolates. To date, no European genotype CyHV-3 has been found emerging in the East and Southeast Asian regions. In late March 2011, an outbreak of CyHV-3 disease occurred in Guangzhou City, Guangdong Province, China, resulting in the deaths of approximately 200 large-sized adult koi within four weeks. One moribund koi was sampled for CyHV-3 isolation. Thus, a CyHV-3 was isolated in KCF-1 cells and designated as KHV-GZ11. Abundant mature or immature virions in infected KCF-1 cells were observed under a transmission electron micrograph. In addition, intra-nuclear inclusion body-like structures with masses of virions were also observed. Based on the TK and ORF136H genes, the sequence analyses revealed that KHV-GZ11 is a distinct European genotype of CyHV-3. Moreover, the infectivity experiment showed that KHV-GZ11 was highly virulent to koi. In summary, we are the first to confirm the emergence of fatal European genotype CyHV-3/KHV in East and Southeast Asia. Our study will provide new insight to explore the virus origin and epidemiology, as well as its pathogenicity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCyprinid herpesvirus 3 3aCyprinus carpio 3adeath 3adisease outbreaks 3aelectrons 3agenes 3agenotype 3akoi 3apathogenicity 3apathogens 3asequence analysis 3avirion 3aviruses 2aAnimals 2aCarps 2aCommunicable Diseases, Emergingxepidemiologyxveterinaryxvirology. 2aFish Diseasesxepidemiologyxvirology. 2aGenotype 2aHerpesviridaexclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxpathogenicity. 2aHerpesviridae Infectionsxepidemiologyxveterinaryxvirology. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aVirionxgeneticsxpathogenicity. 3aChina 0aChinaxepidemiology. 0aCyprinid herpesvirus 3 0aKoi herpesvirus 0aEuropean genotype CyHV-3 0aVirulence1 aLi, Xuezhu1 aWeng, Shaoping1 aXie, Shaoxia1 aHe, Jianguo0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2013 Feb. 22, v. 162, no. 1 p.239-244dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8205x0378-11357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2012.10.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03295naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001600144245013000160300001800290520171400308592002802022650001702050650000902067650001202076650000902088650002202097650001502119650001302134650001302147650001702160653002702177653003102204653003302235700001702268700001602285700001702301700001702318700001702335700001802352700001802370700001402388700005902402700005602461700005702517773013902574856007902713852000902792655001202801IND60765740020221122091620.0220202e20220120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076574002DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.1c189872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Gisung10aMethylammonium Compensation Effects in MAPbI₃ Perovskite Solar Cells for High-Quality Inorganic CuSCN Hole Transport Layers  ap. 5203-5210.  aRecent studies have demonstrated that copper (I) thiocyanate (CuSCN) has huge potential as a hole extraction material (HEM) for perovskite solar cells. Here, we used CuSCN as a HEM and analyzed its relationships with a methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI₃) perovskite layer. The CuSCN dissolved in diethyl sulfide (DES) was spin-coated on the MAPbI₃ layer. For high-quality and dense CuSCN layers, post-annealing was carried out at various temperatures and times. However, the unwanted dissociation of MAPbI₃ to PbI₂ was observed due to the post-annealing for a long time at elevated temperatures. In addition, DES, which is used as a CuSCN solvent, is a polar solvent that damages the surface of MAPbI₃ perovskites and causes poor interfacial properties between the perovskite layer and HEM. To solve this problem, the effect of the molar ratio of methylammonium iodide (MAI) and PbI₂ in the MAPbI₃ precursor solution was investigated. The excess MAI molar ratio in the MAPbI₃ precursor solution reduced MAPbI₃ surface damage despite using DES polar solvent for CuSCN solution. In addition, dissociation of MAPbI₃ to PbI₂ following an adequate post-annealing process was well suppressed. The excess MAI molar ratio in the MAPbI₃ precursor could be compensated for the MA loss and effectively suppress phase separation from MAPbI₃ to MAI + PbI₂ during post-annealing. The efficiency based on the normal planar structure of CuSCN/MAPbI₃ (using excess MAI)/TiO₂ was approximately 17%. The CuSCN-based MAPbI₃ device shows more optimized stability than the conventional spiro-OMeTAD under damp heat (85 °C and 85% relative humidity) conditions because of the robust inorganic HEM.  aPublisher supplied data 3adissociation 3aheat 3aiodides 3alead 3arelative humidity 3aseparation 3asolvents 3asulfides 3athiocyanates 0aperovskite solar cells 0aCuSCN hole transport layer 0aexcess methylammonium iodide1 aKwon, Namhee1 aLee, Dongho1 aKim, Mijoung1 aKim, Moonhoe1 aLee, Yongjei1 aKim, Woojong,1 aHyeon, Daseul1 aKim, Bora1 aJeong, Mun Seok1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7019-80891 aHong, Jinpyo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3329-504X1 aYang, JungYup1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0425-74470 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2022 Jan. 20, v. 14, no. 4 p.5203-5210dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.1c189873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02165naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001900112245009100131300001400222520105700236592002801293650001601321650002101337650002801358650001001386650001601396650002001412650003001432650001401462650001101476650002701487650001901514653000801533653001801541700001901559700001501578773018901593852000901782655001201791IND60706389920221116234245.0200807e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070638992DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSavitha, A.

When fertilizer users use inappropriate fertilization practices in fields, it brings nutrient waste, large investment and residue in soil. The purpose of the present paper is to develop a fixed-amount and variable-rate fertilizer applicator with a vertical spiral conveyor to minimize this risk. As for row replacement, high accurate and uniform application patterns from a reliable fertilizer applicator for precision farming are required. This applicator includes a speed measure unit and a fixed-amount and variable-rate Pulse Width Modulation control system. In order to evaluate our fertilizer applicator, its performance was tested in both laboratory and field. The findings of this study suggest that the applicator with a vertical spiral conveyor and a variable-rate pulse width modulation control system makes fewer errors during application. To guarantee the degree of accuracy of this applicator, the linearity between travel speed and amount of fertilizer is essential. Both of the applicator tests revealed that using the applicator was a positive experience because it can preset expected consumption by operator and always keep amount of fertilizer uniform and accurate while traveling, and it will be widely used in Southwest China.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapplicators 3afertilizer rates 3afertilizers 3aprecision agriculture 3arisk 3asoil 3awastes 3aChina 0aPrecision farming 0aFertilizer application 0aPulse width modulation 0aVertical spiral conveyor 0aCoefficient of variation1 aHe, Peixiang1 aZhang, Jianjun1 aLi, Xiaoxian1 aRen, Zhenyu1 aZhao, Jin1 aHe, Jiacheng1 aWang, Yang1 aLiu, Hongbo1 aKang, Jie0 tComputers and electronics in agriculture.g2018 May, v. 148 p.330-336dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl38096x0168-16997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compag.2018.03.0333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01973naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001800112245016000130300001600290520069000306592002800996650001401024650001501038650002301053650001101076650001101087650002101098650001101119650001001130650000801140650002101148651001001169653002501179653002001204653001501224653002801239700001601267700002401283700002101307700002301328773019101351852000901542655001201551IND60706390120221121002447.0200807e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070639012DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShivaramu, K.12aA new record of the occurrence of Thunbergia sanguinarius (Stal.)

There are no earlier reports on the occurrence of the pest on this plant species and hence it warrants a constant vigil on the pest.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLygaeidae 3aThunbergia 3aendangered species 3afruits 3aimagos 3amedicinal plants 3anymphs 3apests 3asap 3aseed development 3aIndia 0aDecalapis hamiltonii 0amedicinal plant 0anew record 0aThunbergia sanguinarius1 aSouravi, K.1 aRajashekaran, P.

In this paper, we develop a novel portable and automatic measurement system for pig body size. Firstly, we utilize two depth cameras to capture the point clouds of the scene with a pig from two viewpoints and implement the registration of the obtained point clouds. Secondly, we resort to Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) to remove the background point cloud and extract the foreground pig point cloud with a Euclidean clustering. Finally, body measurement is conducted via pose normalization and morphological constraints on pig cloud. We evaluate the proposed system on 20 sets of the scenes with a pig in a commercial pig farm. Experimental results show that the pig object extraction algorithm achieves good performance. The average relative errors for body width, hip width, and body height are 10.30%, 5.87% and 7.01% respectively, which demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aanimal breeding 3abody size 3acameras 3afarms 3ahips 3alivestock and meat industry 3aswine 0aPoint cloud 0aDepth camera 0aAutomatic measurement 0aBody size 0aPig1 aGuo, Hao1 aMa, Qin1 aSu, Wei1 aChen, Luochao1 aZhu, Dehai0 tComputers and electronics in agriculture.g2018 May, v. 148 p.291-298dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl38096x0168-16997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compag.2018.03.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03289naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002600153245009300179300001600272520200500288592002802293650001202321650001302333650000902346650001102355650001402366650001802380650001102398650001502409650001402424650000902438650002002447650001102467650002002478653001702498653002102515653002302536653001802559653002402577700001702601700001502618773010202633856008702735852000902822655001202831IND60563214420221116182105.0170719e20161201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056321442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.07.2112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArenas-Sánchez, Alba10aEffects of water scarcity and chemical pollution in aquatic ecosystems: State of the art  ap. 390-403.  aWater scarcity is an expanding climate and human related condition, which drives and interacts with other stressors in freshwater ecosystems such as chemical pollution. In this study we provide an overview of the existing knowledge regarding the chemical fate, biological dynamics and the ecological risks of chemicals under water scarcity conditions. We evaluated a total of 15 studies dealing with the combined effects of chemicals and water scarcity under laboratory conditions and in the field. The results of these studies have been elaborated in order to evaluate additive, synergistic or antagonistic responses of the studied endpoints. As a general rule, it can be concluded that, in situations of water scarcity, the impacts of extreme water fluctuations are much more relevant than those of an additional chemical stressor. Nevertheless, the presence of chemical pollution may result in exacerbated ecological risks in some particular cases. We conclude that further investigations on this topic would take advantage on the focus on some specific issues. Experimental (laboratory and model ecosystem) studies should be performed on different biota groups and life stages (diapausing eggs, immature stages), with particular attention to those including traits relevant for the adaptation to water scarcity. More knowledge on species adaptations and recovery capacity is essential to predict community responses to multiple stressors and to assess the community vulnerability. Field studies should be performed at different scales, particularly in lotic systems, in order to integrate different functional dynamics of the river ecosystem. Combining field monitoring and experimental studies would be the best option to reach more conclusive, causal relationships on the effects of co-occurring stressors. Contribution of these studies to develop ecological models and scenarios is also suggested as an improvement for the prospective aquatic risk assessment of chemicals in (semi-)arid areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3adiapause 3aeggs 3ahumans 3aimmatures 3alotic systems 3amodels 3amonitoring 3apollution 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3arivers 3awater shortages 0aContaminants 0aTemporary rivers 0aMultiple stressors 0aEcotoxicology 0aAquatic communities1 aRico, Andreu1 aVighi, M.,0 tScience of the total environment.g2016 Dec. 01, v. 572 p.390-403dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.07.2113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02369naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006400148245007100212300001600283520119900299592002801498596011401526650001601640650001701656650001201673650001101685650001201696650001301708650001301721651001101734651001001745700001901755700001501774773012601789856008301915852000901998655001202007IND60777644120221117195115.0220518e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077764412DNAL7 a10.1007/s10460-021-10286-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMariani, Mariagiulia1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3875-638310aCultural biodiversity unpacked, separating discourse from practice  ap. 773-789.  aIn this article, we question to what extent origin-food labels, namely Geographical Indications (GIs) and Slow Food Presidia, may effectively account for cultural biodiversity (CB). Building on Foucault’s discourse theory, we question how the Slow Food movement and GI promoters have developed their own discourse and practice on CB, how these discourses contrast, and how they inform projects. Focusing on the practices to cultivate the microbiological life of three origin labeled cheeses (from France and Italy), we have revealed the gap between these institutional discourses and what happens on the ground. We argue that how actors’ relationships in the marketplace unfold, from public authorities to the collectives of producers to consumers, may threaten the effects that these experiences of alternative food productions may have in the defense of biodiversity, causing, for instance, the loss of diversity of the invisible microbial ecosystems of artisan raw milk cheese. However, we conclude that, despite limitations, the mediatized institutional narrative on CB can amplify the political voice of local actors by fostering community and social relationships between the farmers.  aPublisher supplied data  aWP4 – ‘Economic assessments of the sustainability of agri-food systems’ projectcUniversità di Catania 3aagriculture 3abiodiversity 3acheeses 3ahumans 3amarkets 3apolitics 3araw milk 3aFrance 3aItaly1 aCerdan, Claire1 aPeri, Iuri0 tAgriculture and human values.g2022 June, v. 39, no. 2 p.773-789dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl35543x0889-048X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10460-021-10286-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02665naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003100147245008000178300001800258520153300276592002801809650001501837650001301852650002001865650002201885650002201907650000901929650002701938650001401965650003301979650001302012651001102025700003002036700002602066773010902092856008102201852000902282655001202291IND60081520620221118051324.0150217e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008152062DNAL7 a10.1007/s00606-014-1009-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFajardo, Cristiane Gouvêa10aInterspecific genetic analysis of orchids in Brazil using molecular markers  ap. 1825-1832.  aSeveral species of Orchidaceae, one of the largest plant families, are considered endangered throughout South America and legal protection policies are needed so they can be preserved. Inter simple sequence repeats (ISSRs) markers are a potential tool to be used in the phylogenetic reconstruction of closely related species. In this study, we evaluate the polymorphic information content (PIC) and optimum number of ISSR markers (ONM) for five Laeliinae orchids in order to assess genetic diversity. The phylogenetic relationships between Cattleya granulosa, an endangered Brazilian orchid, and four other native Brazilian species (Brassavola tuberculata, Cattleya bicolor, Cattleya labiata and Cattleya schofieldiana) were analyzed for genetic diversity and differentiation. The 11 selected primers generated 166 unambiguous loci (PIC = 0.354; ONM = 156). Of the five studied species, C. bicolor exhibited the highest level of genetic diversity (H E = 0.219), while C. labiata exhibited the lowest level (H E = 0.132). The percentage of genetic variation among species (analysis of molecular variance) was 23.26 %. The principal component analysis (PCA) of ISSR data showed that unifoliate and bifoliolate species are genetically divergent. Additionally, PCA indicated a close relation between C. granulosa and C. schofieldiana, a species considered to be a variety of C. granulosa by many researchers. Thus, we conclude that ISSR genetic markers are effective in detecting genetic differentiation among orchid species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrassavola 3aCattleya 3agenetic markers 3agenetic variation 3aissues and policy 3aloci 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aphylogeny 3aprincipal component analysis 3avariance 3aBrazil1 ade Almeida Vieira, Fábio1 aMolina, Wagner Franco0 tPlant systematics and evolution.g2014 Oct., v. 300, no. 8 p.1825-1832dSpringer-Verlagx0378-26977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00606-014-1009-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02659naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245012700174300001600301520135000317592002801667650001201695650001601707650002101723650001101744650001401755650001201769650001401781650003401795650001101829650002701840651001301867653001401880653001701894653002801911653001601939653001001955700002301965700002101988700001902009773012502028856005102153852000902204655001202213IND50076119120221119100800.0140410e20120201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007611912DNAL7 a10.1080/02772248.2011.6428742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRocha, Maria João,10aOccurrence of endocrine disruptor compounds in the estuary of the Iberian Douro River and nearby Porto Coast (NW Portugal)  ap. 252-261.  aPrevious studies in the Douro River estuary, based on occasional sampling, showed the presence of several estrogenic disrupting chemicals (EDCs). In sequence, we hypothesized that such type of pollution was more likely an enduring issue than an occasional phenomenon, and that it may even affect recreational beaches in each side of the estuarine mouth. Thus to conclude about the continuous influx of EDCs, water samples were taken twice a day, once per a week, from March to May of 2009, at four sites within the estuary and at two sites in the coastline. After solid-phase extraction, the extracts were prepared for GC-MS analysis of 11 reference EDCs. These embraced natural and pharmaceutical estrogens (17β-estradiol, estrone and 17α-ethynylestradiol) and xenoestrogenic industrial pollutants (4-octylphenol, 4-nonylphenol, and their mono and diethoxylates and bisphenol A). Data showed the ubiquitous presence of potentially hazardous amounts of natural estrogens (particularly of estradiol, ca 5.5 ng L⁻¹) and persistent organic pollutants such as nonylphenol mono (up to 550 ng L⁻¹) and diethoxylate (up to 2000 ng L⁻¹). It was concluded that the targeted area is continuously polluted by the assayed EDCs, and as a consequence, conditions exist for endocrine disturbance in the biota by chronic exposure to EDCs.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeaches 3abisphenol A 3achronic exposure 3acoasts 3aestradiol 3aestrone 3aestuaries 3apersistent organic pollutants 3arivers 3asolid phase extraction 3aPortugal 0aestrogens 0aalkylphenols 0aalkylphenol ethoxylates 0abisphenol A 0aGC-MS1 aCruzeiro, Catarina1 aFerreira, Carlos1 aRocha, Eduardo0 tToxicological and environmental chemistry.g2012 Feb. 1, v. 94, no. 2 p.252-261dTaylor & Francis Groupx1029-04867nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02772248.2011.642874  aDNAL 7aarticle03735naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006000148245018800208300001600396520188100412592002802293596008002321596005602401596007502457650002602532650001602558650001202574650001902586650002502605650002202630650002002652650001202672650002002684650001702704650001802721650001102739650001502750650001202765650002502777650001902802650002202821651001602843700006502859700002702924700006002951773012603011856008303137852000903220655001203229IND60777644220221117195050.0220518e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077764422DNAL7 a10.1007/s10460-021-10267-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarrero, Abrania1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3159-137110aNarrating agricultural resilience after Hurricane María: how smallholder farmers in Puerto Rico leverage self-sufficiency and collaborative agency in a climate-vulnerable food system  ap. 555-571.  aClimate change is a threat to food system stability, with small islands particularly vulnerable to extreme weather events. In Puerto Rico, a diminished agricultural sector and resulting food import dependence have been implicated in reduced diet quality, rural impoverishment, and periodic food insecurity during natural disasters. In contrast, smallholder farmers in Puerto Rico serve as cultural emblems of self-sufficient food production, providing fresh foods to local communities in an informal economy and leveraging traditional knowledge systems to manage varying ecological and climatic constraints. The current mixed methods study sought to document this expertise and employed a questionnaire and narrative interviewing in a purposeful sample of 30 smallholder farmers after Hurricane María to (1) identify experiences in post-disaster food access and agricultural recovery and (2) reveal underlying socioecological knowledge that may contribute to a more climate resilient food system in Puerto Rico. Although the hurricane resulted in significant damages, farmers contributed to post-disaster food access by sharing a variety of surviving fruits, vegetables, and root crops among community members. Practices such as crop diversification, seed banking, and soil conservation were identified as climate resilient farm management strategies, and smallholder farmer networks were discussed as a promising solution to amass resources and bolster agricultural productivity. These recommendations were shared in a narrative highlighting socioecological identity, self-sufficiency, community and cultural heritage, and collaborative agency as integral to agricultural resilience. Efforts to promote climate resilience in Puerto Rico must leverage smallholder farmers’ socioecological expertise to reclaim a more equitable, sustainable, and community-owned food system.  aPublisher supplied data  aDK 007703cNational Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases  aHL143792cNational Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute  aMD013650cNational Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities 3aagricultural industry 3aagriculture 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3acrop diversification 3acultural heritage 3afarm management 3afarmers 3afood production 3afood quality 3afood security 3ahumans 3ahurricanes 3aimports 3aindigenous knowledge 3aquestionnaires 3asoil conservation 3aPuerto Rico1 aLόpez-Cepero, Andrea1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7238-12691 aBorges-Méndez, Ramón1 aMattei, Josiemer1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5424-82450 tAgriculture and human values.g2022 June, v. 39, no. 2 p.555-571dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl35543x0889-048X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10460-021-10267-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02675naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245004900164500001400213520139100227592002801618650003201646650001401678650001501692650001501707650002101722650001201743650001901755650001501774650002301789650002001812650001301832650001301845650001701858650002901875653001801904653002101922653002801943653001401971700001801985700002502003773009802028856008202126852000902208655001202217IND60708087920221121230515.0201118e20201015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070808792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lfs.2020.1182562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaikia, Momi10aRole of microRNA in forming breast carcinoma  aNAL-light  aMicroRNA (miRNA) is a regulatory molecule which supervises various processes and gene expression. RNA polymerase II enzyme regulates miRNA gene transcription whereas miRNA biogenesis includes various proteins or enzymes. Starting from cell proliferation, cell cycle regulation and apoptosis are regulated by alteration in cancerous cells. Aberrant cell proliferation takes place and apoptosis is usually inhibited by oncogenic miRNA. The miRNA can be oncogenic or tumor suppressor in nature and their functions are opposite to each other. During tumorigenesis, the upregulation of oncogenic miRNA is mainly observed along with downregulation of tumor suppressors. The miRNA can degrade the target mRNA by using a slicer named argonaute protein (Ago) or by inhibiting the translation process. The miRNA may positively or negatively regulate the formation of tumor in breast by interfering with cellular activities. Thus, miRNA can be significantly used as a biomarker for monitoring breast cancer. In therapeutic intervention, the delivery of tumor suppressor miRNAs in a cancer patient can help in recovering from cancer. Different miRNAs regulate positively or negatively in these therapies. This review is mainly focused on the role of miRNA in breast carcinoma, its mechanisms and different therapies.

Surface modifications such as exposed facet engineering and surface decoration of nanoparticles (NPs) are simple but useful enhancement strategies for a catalytic system. However, the synergistic effect and mechanism of facet engineering and dual-cocatalyst decoration on piezocatalytic activity are still ambiguous and more investigations are expected. Herein, the piezocatalytic activities of BaTiO₃ (BTO) polyhedrons with anisotropic {001} and {110} facets and BTO cubes with isotropic {001} facets were compared. Furthermore, BaTiO₃ (BTO) convex polyhedrons with selectively deposited Ag NPs and uniformly loaded Co₃O₄ quantum dots (QDs) are rationally synthesized through photochemical deposition. The individual and synergistic effects of Ag NPs and Co₃O₄ QDs on the piezocatalytic activities are systematically studied. It was found that dual-cocatalyst-modified BTO possesses the highest piezocatalytic activity in methyl orange degradation, with a reaction constant k of 0.0539 min–¹, around 5, 2.2, and 1.3 times higher than that of nonmodified and Ag NP- and Co₃O₄ QD-modified BTO, respectively. Moreover, dual-cocatalyst-decorated BTO also exhibits excellent piezocatalytic performance in nondye pollutant degradation, with ∼100% tetracycline hydrochloride decomposed in 60 min. By analyzing the contribution, quantifying the amount of different free radicals, and comparing the chemical states of surface elements before and after piezocatalytic measurements, it was inferred that facet-dependent Ag NPs acted as efficient electron-transport sites, while uniformly loaded Co₃O₄ QDs served as hole-transfer sites to fully facilitate the migration of electrons and holes in a piezocatalytic reaction. This research presents a rational and effectual modification strategy to enhance the piezocatalytic activity of piezocatalysts and gives a thorough discussion of the enhanced mechanism.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanisotropy 3aisotropy 3amethyl orange 3aphotochemistry 3apollutants 3asynergism 3atetracycline 0apiezocatalysis 0aselective deposition 0adual cocatalysts 0areactive oxygen species 0aBaTiO3 polyhedron1 aWu, Jiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7227-64261 aKang, Zihan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4734-25051 aQin, Ni1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7643-87281 aKe, Kanghui1 aBao, Dinghua1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1055-42640 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2022 Jan. 24, v. 14, no. 4 p.5223-5236dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.1c192873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03030naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002400152245009000176300001300266520147200279592002801751650001501779650002401794650001301818650001301831650001701844650001301861650001701874650002701891650001401918650001601932650003401948650002301982650001602005650001302021650001102034650001302045650002002058650001902078653001302097653003202110653002602142653001402168700002202182700001902204700001902223700002102242700002602263773010302289856008702392852000902479655001202488IND60613694420221120224645.0181015e20181120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061369442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2018.06.0852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMilinković, Jelena10aInterfacial and emulsifying properties of chitosan/sodium lauryl ether sulfate system  ap. 9-13.  aMany pharmaceutical, cosmetic and chemical products exist in form of emulsions. A common problem with emulsions is their instability. Interaction between polymer and surfactant could change the adsorption layer around the oil droplets in emulsion which affects their stability. In order to understand the stabilization mechanism, the interface of oil/water systems that contained mixtures of chitosan (Ch), cationic polyelectrolyte and oppositely charged anionic surfactant, sodium lauryl ether sulfate (SLES) was studied by measuring the interfacial tension. Considering the fact that the properties of the oil phase influence the adsorption process, three different types of oil were investigated: medium-chain triglycerides (semi-synthetic oil), paraffin oil (mineral oil) and natural oil obtained from the grape seed. Based on the results of the measurements of interfacial tension, system medium-chain triglycerides/water was selected, for obtaining the 20% oil-in-water (O/W) emulsions. Emulsions were stabilized by Ch/SLES mixture, in mass ratios that correspond to different regions of their interaction. Also investigation on the emulsions characteristics (stability, droplet size and size distribution, zeta potential) was carried out. Results of this study are important for understanding the influence of polymer-surfactant interactions on the properties of solution and stability of dispersed systems that could be useful in microencapsulation processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aanionic surfactants 3achitosan 3acolloids 3adroplet size 3adroplets 3aelectrolytes 3aemulsifying properties 3aemulsions 3agrape seeds 3amedium chain triacylglycerols 3amicroencapsulation 3amineral oil 3apolymers 3asodium 3asulfates 3asurface tension 3azeta potential 0aChitosan 0aSodium lauryl ether sulfate 0aOil–water interface 0aEmulsions1 aPetrović, Lidija1 aFraj, Jadranka1 aBučko, Sandra1 aKatona, Jaroslav1 aSpasojević, Ljiljana0 tColloids and surfaces.g2018 Nov. 20, v. 557 p.9-13dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2018.06.0853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04192naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002700147245009300174300001800267520295400285592002803239650001303267650001103280650001303291650001603304650001303320650001403333650000803347650001203355650001803367650001103385650002303396650001103419650001903430650001903449650001603468651001003484700002203494700001703516773013503533856008103668852000903749655001203758IND60619496620221120024921.0181102e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061949662DNAL7 a10.1007/s00704-017-2321-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGhosh, S.q(Satyajit),12aA sensitivity study of diffusional mass transfer of gases in tropical storm hydrometeors  ap. 1083-1100.  aThis paper quantifies mass transfer and diffusional uptake rates of gases in liquid and solid hydrometeors within a cyclonic system. The non-availability of transfer rates for trace gases diffusing into storm hydrometeors, particularly over polluted urban conurbations, often constrain modellers the world over; however, this is an essential requirement to quantify the scavenging rates over the region concerned. The present paper seeks to provide modellers with such rates. Further, all of the earlier studies apply only to temperate regimes, and surprisingly identical formulations are assumed even for tropical conditions. The present analysis fills this research gap and couples cloud morphology with the associated thermodynamics through Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) runs for cyclone Chapala (27 October 2015–04 November 2015) which battered the coasts of Yemen (Skamarock et al. 2008). It was a good example for undertaking this sensitivity study because the vertical extent spanned from around 0.75 to 16 km—enabling uptake rate calculations over both droplet and ice phases. Many of the diffusing gases were polar; the dipole moment of sulphur dioxide (SO₂) and water vapour (H₂O) was also included using a full Lennard–Jones model to compute the binary diffusivities of these gases as they diffused into the droplets mixed with water vapour. The first-order uptake rate constants ranged from 2.08 × 10⁻⁰⁷ to 3.44 × 10⁻⁰⁶ (s⁻¹) and 1.97 × 10⁻⁰⁷ to 7.81 × 10⁻⁰⁷ (s⁻¹) for H₂O and SO₂ respectively. The rates are of the order of 10⁻⁰⁹ (s⁻¹) for diffusion of water vapour into ice crystals further aloft. Closely linked with the gas uptake rates is another crucial parameter—the mass accommodation coefficient, α. The most widely used values are 1 and 0.036 (Pruppacher and Klett 1998)—the chosen values are restrictive and warrants a closer look. In storm systems, the vertical extents are in the kilometre range. Chapala with a large vertical extent warrants a full profile calculation. This study shows that for H₂O vapour, α values range from a low of 0.004 reaching up to 0.046, and for SO₂ impacting the liquid droplets, they are 0.004 to 0.077. Using these values in cloud droplet growth equations showed large changes in the positioning of the cloud base height up to about a maximum of 30%—a classic example illustrating the coupling of microphysics with dynamics suggesting that even large-scale models should cautiously use standard un-corrected accommodation and diffusion coefficients. Over polluted environments, aerosol number concentrations are very high—several hundreds of particles in a cubic centimetre—the cumulative effect involving such large-scale scavenging ends up in causing substantive changes in the actual scavenging rates. This is likely to affect overall radiative transfer calculations and must be corrected.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3acoasts 3acrystals 3adiffusivity 3adroplets 3aequations 3aice 3aliquids 3amass transfer 3amodels 3aradiative transfer 3astorms 3asulfur dioxide 3athermodynamics 3awater vapor 3aYemen1 aGumber, Siddharth1 aVarotsos, C.0 tTheoretical and applied climatology.g2018 Nov., v. 134, no. 3-4 p.1083-1100dSpringer ViennawJournal:jnl3932171x0177-798X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00704-017-2321-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04600naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245017800154300001800332500001900350520292800369592002803297650003503325650002803360650001303388650003503401650001803436650002603454650001603480650001103496650002003507650002303527650001303550650001703563650001403580650002103594650001303615650002203628650001603650700001603666700001703682700001703699700001703716700001803733700001703751700001803768700001403786700001603800700001603816773013103832856007403963852000904037655001204046IND60714719220221119150106.0201024e20200930xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071471922DNAL7 a10.1039/d0bm00699h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDong, Wei10aPlasmid-loadable magnetic/ultrasound-responsive nanodroplets with a SPIO-NP dispersed perfluoropentane core and lipid shell for tumor-targeted intracellular plasmid delivery  ap. 5329-5345.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aUsing ultrasound activating contrast agents to induce sonoporation is a potential strategy for effective lesion-targeted gene delivery. Previous reports have proven that submicron nanodroplets have a better advantage than microbubbles in that they can pass through tumor vasculature endothelial gaps by passive targeting; however, they cannot achieve an adequate dose in tumors to facilitate ultrasound-enhanced gene delivery. Additionally, a few studies focused on delivering macromolecular genetic materials (i.e. overexpression plasmid and CRISPR plasmid) have presented more unique advantages than small-molecular genetic materials (i.e. miRNA mimics, siRNA and shRNA etc.), such as enhancing the expression of target genes with long-term effectiveness. Thereby, we constructed novel plasmid-loadable magnetic/ultrasound-responsive nanodroplets, where superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticle dispersed perfluoropentane was encapsulated with lipids to which plasmids could be adhered, and branched polyethylenimine was used to protect the plasmids from enzymolysis. Furthermore, in vitro and in vivo studies were performed to verify the magnetic tumor-targeting ability of the plasmid-loadable magnetic/ultrasound-responsive nanodroplets and focused ultrasound enhanced intracellular plasmid delivery. The plasmid-loadable magnetic/ultrasound-responsive nanodroplets, carrying 16–19 plasmids per droplet, had desirable diameters less than 300 nm, and integrated the merits of excellent magnetic targeting capabilities and phase transition sensitivity to focused ultrasound. Under programmable focused ultrasound exposure, the plasmid-loadable magnetic/ultrasound-responsive nanodroplets underwent a phase-transition into echogenic microbubbles and the subsequent inertial cavitation of the microbubbles achieved an ∼40% in vitro plasmid delivery efficiency. Following intravenous administration, T2-weighted magnet resonance imaging, scanning electron microscopy and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry of the tumors showed significantly enhanced intratumoral accumulation of the plasmid-loadable magnetic/ultrasound-responsive nanodroplets under an external magnetic field. And a GFP ELISA assay and immunofluorescence staining indicated that focused ultrasound-induced inertial cavitation of the plasmid-loadable magnetic/ultrasound-responsive nanodroplets significantly enhanced the intracellular delivery of plasmids within the tumor after magnet-assisted accumulation, while only lower GFP levels were observed in the tumors on applying focused ultrasound or an external magnet alone. Taken together, utilizing the excellent plasmid-loadable magnetic/ultrasound-responsive nanodroplets combined with magnetism and ultrasound could efficiently deliver plasmids to cancer cells, which could be a potential strategy for macromolecular genetic material delivery in the clinic to treat cancer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3abiocompatible materials 3adroplets 3afluorescent antibody technique 3agene transfer 3aintravenous injection 3airon oxides 3alipids 3amagnetic fields 3amagnetic materials 3amicroRNA 3amicrobubbles 3aneoplasms 3aphase transition 3aplasmids 3apolyethyleneimine 3aultrasonics1 aHuang, Anqi1 aHuang, Jixiu1 aWu, Pengying1 aGuo, Shifang1 aLiu, Huasheng1 aQin, Mengfan1 aYang, Xinxing1 aZhang, Bo1 aWan, Mingxi1 aZong, Yujin0 tBiomaterials science.g2020 Sept. 30, v. 8, no. 19 p.5329-5345dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26911x2047-48497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0bm00699h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02018naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002700112245018900139300001600328520092100344592002801265650001301293650002101306650002601327650001801353650001001371650001901381650000901400650002401409700001501433700001801448700002601466773019101492852000901683655001201692IND60706390720221120133951.0200807e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070639072DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoorthy, P.

It is caused by the mite, Sarcoptes scabiei, that burrows in the epidermis of the skin of humans and many other mammals. This mite was previously known as Acarus scabiei DeGeer, 1778 before the genus Sarcoptes was established (Latreille 1802) and it became S. scabiei. Research during the last 40 years has tremendously increased insight into the mite’s biology, parasite-host interactions, and the mechanisms it uses to evade the host’s defenses. This review highlights some of the major advancements of our knowledge of the mite’s biology, genome, proteome, and immunomodulating abilities all of which provide a basis for control of the disease. Advances toward the development of a diagnostic blood test to detect a scabies infection and a vaccine to protect susceptible populations from becoming infected, or at least limiting the transmission of the disease, are also presented.  aPublisher supplied data  aR01AI017252cNational Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAcarus 3aSarcoptes scabiei 3aat-risk population 3aburrows 3agenome 3ahematologic tests 3ahost-parasite relationships 3ahumans 3amites 3aproteome 3ascabies 3avaccines1 aMorgan, Marjorie S.0 tParasites & vectors.g2017 Dec., v. 10, no. 1 p.297-297dBioMed CentralwJournal:24143x1756-33057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-017-2234-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02101naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002000143245019300163300001800356520087200374592002801246650001601274650001201290650001101302650002201313650001301335650001301348650000901361650003401370650001101404653002901415653002201444653001501466700002001481773014001501856007701641852000901718655001201727IND60521991620221118191607.0160601e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052199162DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1994-10112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeschel, Stefan10aZur Kristallstruktur der Cyanoelpasolithe [N(CH3)4]2CsCo(CN)6 und [H3NCH3]2NaFe(CN)6 / Concerning the Crystal Structures of the Cyano-Elpasolites [N(CH3)4]2CsCo(CN)6 and [H3NCH3]2NaFe(CN)6  ap. 1373-1380.  aSingle crystals of the cyano complexes [N(CH₃)₄]₂CsCo(CN)₆ and [H₃NCH₃]₂NaFe(CN)₆ were prepared and their structures determined by X-ray methods.

In this respect, layered double hydroxide (LDH)-based conversion layers offer an environmentally benign alternative without toxicologically concerning compounds in the treatment solution. Here, we study an LDH conversion layer on Zn–Al–Mg-coated steel (ZM-coated steel), which was produced by immersion into a carbonate- and magnesium-containing alkaline solution. The mechanism and kinetics of the conversion layer formation were investigated with in situ open circuit potential measurements, cyclic voltammetry (CV), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Acceleration of the LDH layer formation through high convection in the treatment solution was found. This was attributed to a higher oxygen availability at the metal/solution interface because no diffusion-limited state during the layer formation is reached due to high convection. The importance of oxygen within the kinetics indicates a corrosion-like mechanism, with cathodic and anodic sites on the steel sample. The LDH formation happens by co-precipitation of ions present in the treatment solution and dissolved ions from the ZM-coated steel. With CV, SEM, and X-ray diffraction, the growth of the LDH conversion layer was investigated with respect to the immersion time. It was found that after 30 s, the sample surface was almost fully covered with an LDH layer, and with the increasing immersion time, the layer grows in thickness. Increased understanding on the kinetics and mechanism of the LDH conversion layer formation on ZM-coated steel gives rise to a targeted optimization of the treatment solution and process parameters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aadhesion 3aconvection 3acoprecipitation 3acorrosion 3aoxygen 3asteel 3avoltammetry 3awastes 0aLDH 0aZn−Al−Mg-coated steel 0aconversion layer 0aformation kinetics 0ain situ OCP 0acyclic voltammetry1 aLuckeneder, Gerald1 aStrauss, Bernhard,1 aValtiner, Markus1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5410-10670 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2022 Jan. 20, v. 14, no. 4 p.6109-6119dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.1c195733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01525naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245013200168300001800300520052700318592002800845650002000873650001000893650002300903650001200926650001300938650002100951700001900972700002200991773010401013856008501117852000901202655001201211IND60579051120221118225723.0170815e20150501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057905112DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.5b006042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPareek, Manish10aPlatinum(0)-Catalyzed Indolyne Insertion into Bis(pinacolato)diboron Followed by Site-Selective Suzuki–Miyaura Cross-Coupling  ap. 2082-2085.  aIndolynes are converted into previously unprecedented indole building blocks by platinum(0)-catalyzed insertion into a symmetrically substituted boron–boron bond.

Among the MAPK family, the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway is known to be modulated during the infection with porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV); however, involvement of stress-activated protein kinases (SAPKs) comprising p38 MAPK and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) remains to be determined. Therefore, in the present study, we investigated whether activation of p38 MAPK and JNK cascades is required for PEDV replication. Our results showed that PEDV activates p38 MAPK and JNK1/2 up to 24h post-infection, whereas, thereafter their phosphorylation levels recede to baseline levels or even fall below them. Notably, UV-irradiated inactivated PEDV, which can enter cells but cannot replicate inside them, failed to induce phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and JNK1/2 suggesting that viral biosynthesis is essential for activation of these kinases. Treatment of cells with selective p38 or JNK inhibitors markedly impaired PEDV replication in a dose-dependent manner and these antiviral effects were found to be maximal during the early times of the infection. Furthermore, direct pharmacological inhibition of p38 MAPK or JNK1/2 activation resulted in a significant reduction of viral RNA synthesis, viral protein expression, and progeny release. However, independent treatments with either SAPK inhibitor did not inhibit PEDV-induced apoptotic cell death mediated by activation of mitochondrial apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) suggesting that SAPKs are irrelevant to the apoptosis pathway during PEDV infection. In summary, our data demonstrated critical roles of the p38 and JNK1/2 signaling pathways in facilitating successful viral infection during the post-entry steps of the PEDV life cycle.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPorcine epidemic diarrhea virus 3aRNA 3aantiviral properties 3aapoptosis 3abiosynthesis 3adose response 3amitochondria 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3aphosphorylation 3aprogeny 3aprotein synthesis 3asignal transduction 3aultraviolet radiation 3aviruses 0aPEDV 0ap38 MAPK 0aJNK1/2 0aSignal transduction 0aViral replication1 aKim, Youngnam1 aChŏn, Chi-hyŏn,0 tVirus research.g2016 Aug. 15, v. 222 p.1-12dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6283x0168-17027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2016.05.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01924naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100003000112245008900142300001600231520088800247592002801135650001201163650002401175650000901199650001401208650001201222650002301234650001101257650001001268650001001278650001901288650001101307650001101318653001201329700002101341773019101362852000901553655001201562IND60706391120221122055812.0200807e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070639112DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShah, Dharmishthabahen R.10aBiology of spider mite, Tetranychus urticae (Koch) (Acari: Tetranychidae) on gerbera  ap. 162-169.  aThe biology of two spotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae (Koch) was studied on gerbera during summer, monsoon and winter seasons.

COVID-19 is caused by a novel virus SARS-CoV2 (2019-nCoV), against which there is currently no vaccine available; and current antiviral therapies have failed, causing a very high mortality rate. Drug repurposing i.e. utilizing an approved drug for different indication, offers a time- and cost-efficient alternative for making new therapies available to patients. Although there are several reports presenting novel approaches to treat COVID-19, still an attentive review of previous scientific literature is essential to overcome their failure to exhibit efficacy. There is an urgent need to provide a comprehensive outlook toward utilizing drug repurposing as a tool for discovery of new therapies against COVID-19. In this article, we aim to provide a to-the-point review of current literature regarding efficacy of repurposed drugs against COVID-19 and other respiratory infections caused by coronaviruses. We have briefly discussed COVID-19 epidemiology, and then have discussed drug repurposing approaches and examples, specific to respiratory viruses. Limitations of utilization of repurposed drug molecules such as dosage regimen and associated challenges such as localized delivery in respiratory tract have also been discussed in detail.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 3acost effectiveness 3amortality 3apandemic 3arespiratory system 3avaccines 3aviruses 3aEast Asia 0aCovid-19 0aDrug repurposing 0aFDA approved drugs 0aSARS-CoV2 0aLocalized delivery1 aGupta, Vivek0 tLife sciences.g2020 Oct. 15, v. 259 p.118275-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11720x0024-32057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2020.1182753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02403naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005800148245014700206300001600353520121200369592002801581650001901609650001601628650002001644650001101664650001101675650001601686650001301702651001201715700006101727700005901788773012601847856008301973852000902056655001202065IND60777644720221117195103.0220518e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077764472DNAL7 a10.1007/s10460-021-10274-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSiebert, Robin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9481-326910aStrategic framing of genome editing in agriculture: an analysis of the debate in Germany in the run-up to the European Court of Justice ruling  ap. 617-632.  aNew techniques in genome editing have led to a controversial debate about the opportunities and uncertainties they present for agricultural food production and consumption. In July 2018, the Court of Justice of the European Union defined genome editing as a new process of mutagenesis, which implies that the resulting organisms count as genetically modified and are subject, in principle, to the obligations of EU Directive 2001/18/EG. This paper examines how key protagonists from academia, politics, and the economy strategically framed the debate around genome editing in agriculture in Germany prior to its legal classification by the Court of Justice. It is based on an analysis of 96 official statements, including position papers, press releases, and information brochures. Our study reveals eight strategic frames used in the discourse on genome editing and uncovers the strategies used to disconnect from or connect with the previous discourse on green genetic engineering in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. Building on competitive framing theory, the study provides explanations for the use and emergence of counter-framing strategies and their success or failure in the debate around genome editing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3aagriculture 3afood production 3agenome 3ahumans 3amutagenesis 3apolitics 3aGermany1 aHerzig, Christian1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4480-10911 aBirringer, Marc1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0343-47040 tAgriculture and human values.g2022 June, v. 39, no. 2 p.617-632dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl35543x0889-048X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10460-021-10274-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02086naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001900143245016100162300001800323520108600341592002801427650001101455650001401466650001301480653002701493653001301520700002401533773015301557856007701710852000901787655001201796IND60521991820221118191637.0160601e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052199182DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1994-10132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRemmert, Peter14aDie Einlagerung von Pyridin in ternäre Übergangsmetalldisulfide Ta1-xMoxS2 / Intercalation of Pyridine into Ternary Transition Metal Disulfides Ta1-xMoxS2  ap. 1387-1390.  aTernary phases Ta₁₋ₓMoₓS₂ with 0.25 ≤ x ≤ 0.55 have been investigated regarding their intercalation potential using pyridine as guest molecule. Intercalation yields hexagonal phases Ta₁₋ₓMoₓS₂·(pyridine)ₙ. The different phases have been characterized by elemental analysis as well as TGA and powder diffraction patterns, which have been indexed using the space group P3m1. For the compound Ta₀.₆₅Mo₀.₃₅S₂·(pyridine)₀.₃₈ a structural model was developed, based on powder diffraction data: P3m1, a = 3.275(2), c = 12.008(7)Å and Z = 1. During intercalation the stacking sequence of the host lattice is changed from BaB/AcA/CbC to BaB(pyr)/BaB(pyr). Intercalation of pyridine into Ta₁₋ₓMoₓS₂ proceeds via a two-step mechanism. In the first step orthorhombic phases are formed with reduced pyridine content as compared to the final intercalation product; e.g. Ta₀.₅₅Mo₀.₄₅S₂·(pyridine)₀.₃₈. The first step intercalation compounds can be obtained by interruption of the intercalation reaction after 7 days.  aPublisher supplied data 3amodels 3apyridines 3asulfides 0aIntercalation Reaction 0aPyridine1 aHummel, Hans-Ulrich0 tZeitschrift für Naturforschung.g2014 June 2, v. 49, no. 10 p.1387-1390dVerlag der Zeitschrift für NaturforschungwJournal:23182x0932-07767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/znb-1994-10133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02651naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245020200164300001600366520137800382592002801760650001301788650001701801650000901818650002001827650001101847650001401858650001501872650000901887650001501896650002801911650002501939651000901964700001701973700001801990700002202008773013302030856008102163852000902244655001202253IND60619497020221120095540.0181102e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061949702DNAL7 a10.1007/s00704-017-2300-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHamidi, Omid10aApplication of random forest time series, support vector regression and multivariate adaptive regression splines models in prediction of snowfall (a case study of Alvand in the middle Zagros, Iran)  ap. 769-776.  aWe have conducted a case study to investigate the performance of support vector machine, multivariate adaptive regression splines, and random forest time series methods in snowfall modeling. These models were applied to a data set of monthly snowfall collected during six cold months at Hamadan Airport sample station located in the Zagros Mountain Range in Iran. We considered monthly data of snowfall from 1981 to 2008 during the period from October/November to April/May as the training set and the data from 2009 to 2015 as the testing set. The root mean square errors (RMSE), mean absolute errors (MAE), determination coefficient (R ²), coefficient of efficiency (E%), and intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) statistics were used as evaluation criteria. Our results indicated that the random forest time series model outperformed the support vector machine and multivariate adaptive regression splines models in predicting monthly snowfall in terms of several criteria. The RMSE, MAE, R ², E, and ICC for the testing set were 7.84, 5.52, 0.92, 0.89, and 0.93, respectively. The overall results indicated that the random forest time series model could be successfully used to estimate monthly snowfall values. Moreover, the support vector machine model showed substantial performance as well, suggesting it may also be applied to forecast snowfall in this area.  aPublisher supplied data 3aairports 3acase studies 3acold 3adata collection 3amodels 3amountains 3aprediction 3asnow 3astatistics 3asupport vector machines 3atime series analysis 3aIran1 aTapak, Leili1 aAbbasi, Hamed1 aMaryanaji, Zohreh0 tTheoretical and applied climatology.g2018 Nov., v. 134, no. 3-4 p.769-776dSpringer ViennawJournal:jnl3932171x0177-798X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00704-017-2300-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02937naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245009000166300001600256520174600272592002802018650001102046650001202057650002502069650002802094650002202122650001902144650001002163650001602173650001702189650001902206650001402225650001302239650001402252650001002266650001702276700001602293700002002309773009602329856008102425852000902506655001202515IND60580759320221119013034.0170929e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058075932DNAL7 a10.1007/s00442-017-3930-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGiroldo, A. B.10aTrait shifts associated with the subshrub life-history strategy in a tropical savanna  ap. 281-291.  aOver the past 10 million years, tropical savanna environments have selected for small growth forms within woody plant lineages. The result has been the evolution of subshrubs (geoxyles), presumably as an adaptation to frequent fire. To evaluate the traits associated with the shift from tree to subshrub growth forms, we compared seed biomass, germination, survival, resprouting, biomass allocation, and photosynthesis between congeneric trees and subshrubs, and quantified phylogenetic conservatism. Despite large differences in adult morphology between trees and subshrub species, the differences are modest in seedlings, and most of the variation in traits was explained by genus, indicating considerable phylogenic conservatism. Regardless, tree seedlings invested more heavily in aboveground growth, compared to subshrubs, which is consistent with the adult strategy of savanna trees, which depend on a large resistant-fire stem. Subshrub seedlings also invest in greater non-structural carbohydrate reserves, likely as an adaptation to the high fire frequencies typical of tropical savannas. The modest differences as seedlings suggest that selective pressures during early development may not have contributed substantially to the evolution of the subshrub growth form and that the distinct allocation and life history must arise later in life. This is consistent with the interpretation that the subshrub growth form arose as a life-history strategy in which maturity is reached at a small stem size, allowing them to reproduce despite repeated fire-induced topkill. The convergent evolution of subshrubs within multiple tree lineages reaffirms the importance of fire in the origin and diversification of the flora of mesic savannas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3abiomass 3aconvergent evolution 3adry matter partitioning 3aearly development 3afire frequency 3aflora 3agermination 3alife history 3aphotosynthesis 3aphylogeny 3asavannas 3aseedlings 3atrees 3awoody plants1 aScariot, A.1 aHoffmann, W.

The method is based on the hyperchromic and bathochromic effect of an ionic liquid namely, 1-methyl-3-octadecyl-imidazolium bromide (C₁₈mimBr), on molybdenum ion (Mo(vi)) and pyrogallol red (PGR) complex. The ternary complex of Mo–PGR–C₁₈mimBr displays a distinct absorption peak with excellent analytical characteristics and offers the advantages of simplicity for the determination of Mo(vi) ions, without any need for a solvent extraction step. The limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) of the method were calculated as 0.74 ng mL⁻¹ and 2.47 ng mL⁻¹ respectively. The method was validated and applied successfully to the determination of Mo(vi) ions in real water samples. The interference of ferric ions was shown to be removed from samples with less ionic content by using an ion exchange resin prior to the analysis, and the performance of the method was compared with that of ICP-MS.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aanalytical methods 3adetection limit 3aion exchange resins 3aionic liquids 3aions 3airon 3amolybdenum 3aplant growth substances 3apyrogallol 3aspectrophotometers 3awater solubility1 aKoçak, Süleyman1 aPelit, Füsun Okçu1 aTürkmen, Hayati1 aErtaş, F.

The lithium ion dilution factor during the CVL is used to calculate the volume of cervicovaginal fluid (CVF) collected. Initial CVL Li⁺ concentrations of 1mM and 10mM were evaluated. The method is robust, practical, and afforded an accurate measurement (5% of the measurement, or better) at 24μL of vaginal fluid simulant collected per mL of CVL fluid, as low as 5μLmL⁻¹ using 10mM Li⁺ with a measurement accuracy of 6.7%. Ion chromatograms of real-world CVL samples collected in vivo from common animal models (sheep and pig-tailed macaque) and a human volunteer demonstrate that the analysis is interference-free. The method is readily transferrable and should enable the accurate measurement of CVF volume collected during CVLs benefitting a broad range of research disciplines, including pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, metabolomic, and microbiome studies.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanimal models 3achromatography 3afemale genitalia 3ahumans 3aions 3alithium 3ametabolomics 3amicrobiome 3apharmacokinetics 3asheep 0aBSA 0aBV 0aCVF 0aCVL 0aHPW 0aMSA 0aVFS 0aCervicovaginal fluid dilution 0aCervicovaginal lavage 0aIon chromatography 0aLithium1 aMoss, John A.1 aBaum, Marc M.0 tJournal of chromatography.g2016 Apr. 01, v. 1017-1018 p.75-81dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12459x1570-02327nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jchromb.2016.02.0333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02806naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002700144245011300171500001900284520142700303592002801730650001601758650002401774650002201798650001401820650001701834650002501851650001301876650001501889700003601904700004601940700002501986700003202011700002002043700002402063700002902087700003002116700003102146773012002177856007802297852000902375655001202384IND60735267020221120194544.0210423e20210331xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073526702DNAL7 a10.3390/plants100406712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShilpashree, Nagaraju 10aMorphological Characterization, Variability and Diversity among Vegetable Soybean (Glycine max L.) Genotypes  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aVegetable soybean production is dependent on the development of vegetable type varieties that would be achieved by the use of germplasm to evolve new agronomically superior yielding vegetable type with beneficial biochemical traits. This can be accomplished by a better understanding of genetics, which is why the research was conducted to reveal the quantitative genetics of vegetable soybean genotypes. Genetic variability of main morphological traits in vegetable soybean genotypes and their divergence was estimated, as a result of the magnitude of genotypic variation (GV), and phenotypic variation (PV) of traits varied among the genotypes. All traits showed high heritability (h²) associated with high genetic advance percentage mean (GAM). Therefore, these variable traits are potential for genetic improvement of vegetable type soybean. Genetic diversity is the prime need for breeding, and the magnitude of genetic diversity values were maximized among specific genotypes. Eight clusters were found for all genotypes; cluster VIII and cluster I were considered to have the most diversity. Cluster VIII consisted of two genotypes (GM-6 and GM-27), based on the mean outcomes of the high yield attributing traits. Hence, these two (GM-6, GM-27) genotypes can be advanced for commercial cultivation; furthermore, other genotypes can be used as source of breeding lines for genetic improvement of vegetable soybean.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGlycine max 3agenetic improvement 3agenetic variation 3agermplasm 3aheritability 3aphenotypic variation 3asoybeans 3avegetables1 aDevi, Sarojinikunjamma  Nirmala1 aManjunathagowda, Dalasanuru  Chandregowda1 aMuddappa, Anjanappa 1 aAbdelmohsen, Shaimaa  A.

The CoS nanorods were synthesized on the surface of bare Ni foam after hydrothermal method, while graphen on Ni foam facilitated to form CoS nanowires with porosity surface structure and large specific surface area. The CoS nanowires on Ni foam coated with graphene showed an high specific capacitance of 1506Fg⁻¹ at 1Ag⁻¹ and 88.2% capacity retention at a current density of 1Ag⁻¹ after 5000 cycles charge-discharge test. The improved electronic conductivity of current collector Ni foam by graphene and porous microstructure of CoS nanowires catalyzed by graphene enhanced significantly supercapacitors performance. This was attributed to large CoS nanowires electrode-electrolyte contact area and reduced volume change during the charge-discharge process.  aPublisher supplied data 3acapacitance 3afoams 3agraphene 3amicrostructure 3ananorods 3ananowires 3anickel 3aporosity 3asurface area 3avapors 0aCoS 0aGraphene 0aSupercapacitors 0aNanowires 0aPorosity1 aTongxiang, Liang1 aMeng, Yang1 aSuzuki, Ken1 aMiura, Hideo0 tColloids and surfaces.g2017 Sept. 20, v. 529 p.57-63dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2017.05.0743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02311naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002800151245006800179300001400247520098600261592002801247650001601275650001701291650002601308650001201334650002201346650001601368653001601384653001701400653001601417653001501433700002001448700002001468700002101488700002601509700002901535700002801564700002201592700002401614700002801638773010501666856008501771852000901856655001201865IND60565373220221121180905.0170323e20170403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056537322DNAL7 a10.1080/19393210.2016.12665222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTzatzarakis, Manolis N.10aBisphenol A in soft drinks and canned foods and data evaluation  ap. 85-90.  aBisphenol A (BPA) is one of the most common industrial chemicals and known to exert endocrine disruption activity.

It was found that 56% of 1947 differentially expressed genes were upregulated in mutant cells. Most significant differences were found in unigenes related to photosynthesis, carotenoid biosynthesis and fatty acid biosynthesis pathways. The pyruvate kinase increased by 3.5-fold in mutant cells. Thus, more pyruvate, which was beneficial to carotenoids and fatty acid biosynthesis, was generated. Phytoene synthase, zeta-carotene desaturase, lycopene beta-cyclase involved in β-carotene biosynthesis in mutant cells were upregulated by 10.4-, 4.4-, and 5.8-fold, respectively. Beta-carotene 3-hydroxylase catalyzing conversion of β-carotene into astaxanthin was upregulated by 18.4-fold. The fatty acid biosynthesis was promoted because of the upregulation of acetyl-CoA synthetase and acetyl-CoA carboxylase, thus increasing astaxanthin esterification and accumulation in mutant cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHaematococcus pluvialis 3aacetate-CoA ligase 3aacetyl-CoA carboxylase 3aastaxanthin 3abeta-carotene 3abeta-carotene 3-hydroxylase 3abiochemical pathways 3abiosynthesis 3acarbon dioxide 3aesterification 3afatty acids 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3alycopene beta-cyclase 3amutants 3aphotosynthesis 3aphytoene synthase 3apyruvate kinase 3apyruvic acid 3atranscriptomics 3aunigenes 0aHaematococcus pluvialis 0aAstaxanthin 0aMutant cells 0aTranscriptome sequencing 0aMetabolic pathways1 aLi, Ke1 aZhu, Yanxia1 aYang, Weijuan1 aZhou, Junhu1 aCen, Kefa0 tBioresource technology.g2017 Mar., v. 228 p.99-105dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2016.12.0843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02454naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245012000168300001800288520099700306592002801303650002001331650002401351650001101375650002201386650001201408650003701420650001601457650001101473700002101484700002001505700002001525700003401545700002001579700002101599700002001620700002101640700001701661700003501678700002001713700002101733773015101754856008201905852000901987655001201996IND60609076120221118030952.0180909e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060907612DNAL7 a10.1007/s00018-018-2807-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSbardella, Diego14aThe insulin-degrading enzyme is an allosteric modulator of the 20S proteasome and a potential competitor of the 19S  ap. 3441-3456.  aThe interaction of insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) with the main intracellular proteasome assemblies (i.e, 30S, 26S and 20S) was analyzed by enzymatic activity, mass spectrometry and native gel electrophoresis. IDE was mainly detected in association with assemblies with at least one free 20S end and biochemical investigations suggest that IDE competes with the 19S in vitro. IDE directly binds the 20S and affects its proteolytic activities in a bimodal fashion, very similar in human and yeast 20S, inhibiting at (IDE) ≤ 30 nM and activating at (IDE) ≥ 30 nM. Only an activating effect is observed in a yeast mutant locked in the “open” conformation (i.e., the α-3ΔN 20S), envisaging a possible role of IDE as modulator of the 20S “open”–”closed” allosteric equilibrium. Protein–protein docking in silico proposes that the interaction between IDE and the 20S could involve the C-term helix of the 20S α-3 subunit which regulates the gate opening of the 20S.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenzyme activity 3agel electrophoresis 3ahumans 3amass spectrometry 3amutants 3aproteasome endopeptidase complex 3aproteolysis 3ayeasts1 aTundo, Grazia R.1 aColetta, Andrea1 aMarcoux, Julien1 aKoufogeorgou, Efthymia Ioanna1 aCiaccio, Chiara1 aSantoro, Anna M.1 aMilardi, Danilo1 aGrasso, Giuseppe1 aCozza, Paola1 aBousquet-Dubouch, Marie-Pierre1 aMarini, Stefano1 aColetta, Massimo0 tCellular and molecular life sciences.g2018 Sept., v. 75, no. 18 p.3441-3456dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl55291x1420-682X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00018-018-2807-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02615naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100003700155245014200192300001600334520122600350592002801576650001401604650002401618650002501642650000901667650001701676650001801693650001001711650001501721650001401736650001801750651001101768653001401779653001801793653002401811653001101835700002701846700002701873700002401900700002901924700002801953773007801981856008902059852000902148655001202157IND60565076020221120030505.0170320e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056507602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.actatropica.2017.02.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZepeda-Velázquez, Andrea Paloma10aPathogenicity of Mexican isolates of Aeromonas sp. in immersion experimentally-infected rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss, Walbaum 1792)  ap. 122-124.  aTen species of Aeromonas have been previously identified in farmed rainbow trout from Mexico. The aim of the current study was to investigate the pathogenicity of 10 Aeromonas isolates belonging to 10 different Aeromonas species in immersion experimentally-infected rainbow trout fry. Isolates of A. bestiarum, A. hydrophila, A. salmonicida, and A. veronii produced significant mortality (8.8%, 12.2%, 18.8%, and 8.8%, respectively). Isolates of A. caviae and A. sobria produced no significantly mortality (3.3% and 1.1%, respectively). No mortality was recorded in fish infected with A. allosaccharophila, A. lusitana, A. media, or A. popoffii. Microscopic lesions and bacterial reisolation were registered in liver of fish infected with the ten different Aeromonas isolates. Our results suggest that all Aeromonas species included in the study have the ability to colonize the liver. The results have confirmed that species A. bestiarum, A. hydrophila, A. salmonicida, and A. veronii affected fish as elsewhere reported. In conclusion, the variation in pathogenicity of Aeromonas isolates included in the study, emphasizes the importance of active, on-going monitoring of Aeromonas in the Mexican rainbow trout farming.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAeromonas 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3abacterial infections 3afish 3afish culture 3afish diseases 3aliver 3amonitoring 3amortality 3apathogenicity 3aMexico 0aAeromonas 0aPathogenicity 0aOncorhynchus mykiss 0aMexico1 aVega-Sánchez, Vicente1 aOrtega-Santana, César1 aRubio-Godoy, Miguel1 ade Oca-Mira, Dany Montes1 aSoriano-Vargas, Edgardo0 tActa tropica.g2017 May, v. 169 p.122-124dElsevier B.V.x0001-706X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actatropica.2017.02.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02195naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245011800156300001800274520097200292592002801264650002201292650002201314650002001336650002101356650001901377650001501396650001401411650000701425650001501432650003301447650001501480650001301495700001601508700001701524700001501541700001801556773012801574856007401702852000901776655001201785IND60656677320221118033640.0190814e20130822xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065667732DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ay40773j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Zhen10aDetermination of l-tryptophane using a sensor platform based on LaCoO₃ poriferous nanofibers by electrospinning  ap. 4859-4864.  aWe report a sensor platform for the determination of l-tryptophane.

The structures and morphologies of LaCoO₃ poriferous nanofibers were characterized by X-ray diffraction spectrum and scanning electron microscopy. The electrochemical performance of the sensor was evaluated by cyclic voltammetry and amperometry, and the results demonstrated that it exhibits strong electrocatalytical activity towards the oxidation of l-tryptophan in 0.1 mol L⁻¹ phosphate buffer solution (pH 3.0). The linear range of l-tyrosine was 5.0 × 10⁻⁸ to 5.0 × 10⁻⁶ mol L⁻¹ with a low detection limit down to 1.0 × 10⁻⁸ mol L⁻¹. Moreover, the modified electrode exhibited high selectivity, long-term stability and fast current response, demonstrating its feasibility for the analytical purpose.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3acarbon electrodes 3adetection limit 3aelectrochemistry 3aheat treatment 3ananofibers 3aoxidation 3apH 3aphosphates 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atryptophan 3atyrosine1 aGu, Shuqing1 aDing, Yaping1 aJin, Jindi1 aZhang, Fenfen0 tAnalytical methods.g2013 Aug. 22, v. 5, no. 18 p.4859-4864dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3ay40773j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02906naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100006400155245012800219520152800347592002801875650001901903650001901922650001901941650002001960650001901980650002001999650002402019650001902043650003702062650001402099650001302113653000902126653001302135653001502148700006102163700002102224700006102245773009102306856009002397852000902487655001202496IND60758332120221120122414.0220205e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075833212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1329812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKariyawasam, Thiloka1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8885-734510aPolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon contamination in soils and sediments: Sustainable approaches for extraction and remediation  aPolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are carcinogenic environmental pollutants that are extremely hydrophobic in nature and resistant to biological degradation. Extraction of PAHs from environmental matrices is the first and most crucial step in PAH quantification. Extraction followed by quantification is essential to understand the extent of contamination prior to the application of remediation approaches. Due to their non-polar structures, PAHs can be adsorbed tightly to the organic matter in soils and sediments, making them more difficult to be extracted. Extraction of PAHs can be achieved by a variety of methods. Techniques such as supercritical and subcritical fluid extraction, microwave-assisted solvent extraction, plant oil-assisted extraction and some microextraction techniques provide faster PAH extraction using less organic solvents, while providing a more environmentally friendly and safer process with minimum matrix interferences. More recently, more environmentally friendly methods for soil and sediment remediation have been explored. This often involves using natural chemicals, such as biosurfactants, to solubilize PAHs in contaminated soils and sediments to allow subsequent microbial degradation. Vermiremediation and microbial enzyme-mediated remediation are emerging approaches, which require further development. The following summarises the existing literature on traditional PAH extraction and bioremediation methods and contrasts them to newer, more environmentally friendly ways.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodegradation 3abioremediation 3abiosurfactants 3acarcinogenicity 3ahydrophobicity 3amicroextraction 3amicrowave treatment 3aorganic matter 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3asediments 3asolvents 0aSoil 0aSediment 0aExtraction1 aDoran, Gregory S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6328-93881 aHowitt, Julia A.1 aPrenzler, Paul D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0323-89140 tChemosphere.g2022 Mar., v. 291 p.132981-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1329813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03032naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245007500163300001800238520207800256592002802334650001902362650001502381650001402396650001402410650002002424650002102444650001002465650001202475650001202487700002002499700002002519773008602539856004802625852000902673655001202682IND50068262920221119175525.0130802e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006826292DNAL7 a10.1007/s10570-013-9978-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhn, Kyujin14aThe influence of alkaline reserve on the aging behavior of book papers  ap. 1989-2001.  aDegradation of cellulose under alkaline conditions is involved either involuntarily or deliberately in many different cellulose processing steps, such as pulping, bleaching, or aging within the viscose process, and the underlying chemistry has been the topic of numerous studies. When it comes to aging under alkaline conditions—either natural or accelerated (artificial)—the degradation processes are by far less investigated and understood. A prominent example of moderately alkaline cellulosic material is deacidified book paper from libraries which had undergone a mass-deacidification treatment. We studied their aging behavior under accelerated conditions in comparison to non-deacidified duplicates in order to better understand how the alkaline reserve, which was introduced by the deacidification treatment, affects the stability of the books on the long run. GPC analysis of cellulose and determination of carbonyl functionalities were performed, which were critical parameters to achieve a deeper insight into hydrolytic and oxidative changes of cellulose structure upon deacidification treatment and subsequent aging. Also, model book papers impregnated with different amounts of alkaline reserve were used to support the findings from the original book samples. Hydrolytic degradation rates of the original book papers were significantly reduced after mass deacidification compared to the non-deacidified duplicates. The beneficial effect of mass deacidification on cellulose stability was found to be strongly related to the amount of alkaline reserve deposited, independent of varying parameters of book papers. Although some indication of alkali-induced β-elimination was found (a minor decrease of the along-chain carbonyl content in the original deacidified book papers during aging), it did not occur to an extent that significantly influenced the molar mass of cellulose. The beneficial effect of retarded hydrolytic degradation by mass deacidification thus clearly outweighed possible negative alkalinity effects of the deposited alkaline reserve.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkali reserve 3aalkalinity 3ableaching 3acellulose 3adeacidification 3amolecular weight 3apaper 3apulping 3aviscose1 aRosenau, Thomas1 aPotthast, Antje0 tCellulose.g2013 Aug., v. 20, no. 4 p.1989-2001dSpringer-Verlagx0969-02397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10570-013-9978-3  aDNAL 7aarticle04162naa a2200817 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024005700111040001800168072000900186072000900195100001600204245008700220300001600307500002400323500002400347500001500371520157300386650002501959650002201984650001302006650001002019650001202029650004102041650001402082650002802096650003002124650001702154650001402171650001002185650002802195650002002223650001602243650002702259650001302286650001802299650002502317650001202342650006202354650001202416650005502428650002302483650003302506650003602539650001302575650003902588650002802627650003102655650002202686650001002708650005202718650004302770650003202813650003702845650002302882653002802905653002202933653002202955700001802977700001602995700001803011773011603029852000903145856010703154930003303261945002503294946001303319655001203332IND4390658820221118111433.0070426e200703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439065882DNAL7 a174612762pmid7 a10.1637/0005-2086(2007)051[0118:FLIADT]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL833 0aL8001 aMoscoso, H.10aFTA Liver Impressions as DNA Template for Detecting and Genotyping Fowl Adenovirus  ap. 118-121.  aIncludes references  aSummary in Spanish.  a2019-12-06  aThe feasibility of using liver impressions on Flinders Technology Associates (FTA) filter paper for the collection, inactivation, and molecular analysis of fowl adenovirus (FAV) was evaluated. FAV I European Union (EU) serotype 1 spotted on FTA was shown to be inactivated using specific-pathogen-free (SPF) primary chicken embryo liver cell culture as indicated by absence of cytopathic effect. Sensitivity of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test using tenfold dilutions of allantoic fluid from 100 to 10-4 for the detection of adenovirus serotype 1 on FTA cards was determined to be 0.0005 mean tissue culture infectious dose per FTA spot. The stability of the DNA from liver impressions on the FTA was found to be 198 days when stored at -20°C. In a trial, inclusion body hepatitis (IBH) was experimentally reproduced in SPF chickens inoculated with FAV I EU serogroup 1, 4, 8, or 11, which presented weakness, pallor, depression, dehydration, and mortality within 6 days after inoculation. PCR performed on FTA liver impressions from the inoculated birds was able to detect all four viruses, and the nucleotide sequence analysis of the amplified PCR products (1219 bp of the hexone gene) revealed the expected serotypes. In addition to the trial, 55 clinical samples were analyzed from liver impressions on FTA cards, and FAV was detected in 11 of 55 (20%). Sequencing analysis showed that the viruses were EU serotypes 4, 5, 9, and 10. The results demonstrate that FTA filter paper inactivates the FAV I and maintains the DNA template for molecular analysis. 3aFowl aviadenovirus A 3adisease detection 3asampling 3aliver 3astorage 3aviral diseases of animals and humans 3aserotypes 3amicrobiological quality 3apolymerase chain reaction 3ainactivation 3abiosafety 3apaper 3apathogen identification 3astorage quality 3areliability 3amolecular epidemiology 3agenotype 3abird diseases 3anucleotide sequences 3afilters 2aAdenoviridae Infectionsxdiagnosisxveterinaryxvirology. 2aAnimals 2aAviadenovirusxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aChickensxvirology 2aCytopathogenic Effect, Viral 2aDNA, Viralxanalysisxgenetics. 2aGenotype 2aHepatitis, Viral, Animalxvirology 2aInclusion Bodies, Viral 2aLiverxcytologyxvirology. 2aMicropore Filters 2aPaper 2aPolymerase Chain Reactionxmethodsxveterinary. 2aPoultry Diseasesxdiagnosisxvirology. 2aSensitivity and Specificity 2aSpecific Pathogen-Free Organisms 2aTemplates, Genetic 0amolecular sequence data 0aliver impressions 0aFowl adenovirus A1 aBruzual, J.J.1 aSellers, H.1 aHofacre, C.L.0 tAvian diseases.g2007 Mar., v. 51, no. 1 p.118-121dAmerican Association of Avian Pathologistsx0005-20867nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1637/0005-2086(2007)051[0118:FLIADT]2.0.CO;23Available from publisher's Web site  a20070820b20070902c00000000  aINDd4CTe2007/07/24  aOther US 7aarticle02709naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004700094040001800141100001800159245013400177520113200311592002801443650001601471650001801487650001801505650001601523650002101539650001701560650000901577650002601586650001501612650001001627650001901637653002901656653001801685653002101703653002101724700001901745700001701764700001501781700002001796700001801816700001601834700005201850700001301902700005401915700001701969773011401986856009402100852000902194655001202203IND60732767020221122082954.0210519e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073276702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2021.1095612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Shuheng14aThe encapsulation of intumescent flame retardants by poly-siloxane for thermoplastic polyolefin: Fire safety and water resistance  aThe flammability of thermoplastic polyolefins (TPO) is a prior concern related to fire disasters. The fire safety strategy for TPO has not been settled because of serious waterproof property deteriorations caused by the presence of flame retardant additives. This work reported an encapsulation of conventional intumescent flame retardant (IFR) additives by a poly-siloxane (Si-IFR) and its application in TPO composites. The fire behavior characterization revealed that the peak heat release rate and smoke density of the TPO/Si-IFR sample was decreased by 26.5% and 24.0% respectively compared with that of the TPO/IFR sample. The flame retardant mechanism analysis suggested that the poly-siloxane coated IFR formed compact char layers through Si-O structures and nano-silica attachment on the carbonous layer. Notably, the flame retardancy and mechanical property for the TPO/Si-IFR sample were almost unchanged after being soaked in water for 7 days at 70°C. Consequently, this work proved that the poly-siloxane encapsulated IFR was an effective additive for producing flame retardant and water resistant TPO composites.  aPublisher supplied data 3adegradation 3aencapsulation 3afire behavior 3afire safety 3aflame retardants 3aflammability 3aheat 3amechanical properties 3apolyolefin 3asmoke 3athermoplastics 0athermoplastic polyolefin 0apoly-siloxane 0aflame retardancy 0awater resistance1 aJiang, Yichong1 aMeng, Yujuan1 aLi, Yuchun1 aHan, Zhongqiang1 aLiu, Xiaodong1 aLi, Hongfei1 aSun, Jun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2583-66001 aFei, Bin1 aGu, Xiaoyu1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2929-24411 aZhang, Sheng0 tPolymer degradation and stability.g2021 June, v. 188 p.109561-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12486x0141-39107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2021.1095613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02887naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002600188245009200214300001800306500001100324506007600335520138000411592002801791506003701819650001901856650002501875650001601900650001901916650001601935650001601951650001601967650001601983650001001999650001702009650001402026650001402040650002102054650001602075650002202091700002202113700002802135773015102163856008202314852000902396655001202405IND60609076420221207142551.0180909e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060907642DNAL7 a10.1007/s00018-018-2860-62doi7 aPMC61051742pmcid7 a299365962pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIpsen, David Højland10aMolecular mechanisms of hepatic lipid accumulation in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease  ap. 3313-3327.  aReview  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aNon-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is currently the world’s most common liver disease, estimated to affect up to one-fourth of the population. Hallmarked by hepatic steatosis, NAFLD is associated with a multitude of detrimental effects and increased mortality. This narrative review investigates the molecular mechanisms of hepatic steatosis in NAFLD, focusing on the four major pathways contributing to lipid homeostasis in the liver. Hepatic steatosis is a consequence of lipid acquisition exceeding lipid disposal, i.e., the uptake of fatty acids and de novo lipogenesis surpassing fatty acid oxidation and export. In NAFLD, hepatic uptake and de novo lipogenesis are increased, while a compensatory enhancement of fatty acid oxidation is insufficient in normalizing lipid levels and may even promote cellular damage and disease progression by inducing oxidative stress, especially with compromised mitochondrial function and increased oxidation in peroxisomes and cytochromes. While lipid export initially increases, it plateaus and may even decrease with disease progression, sustaining the accumulation of lipids. Fueled by lipo-apoptosis, hepatic steatosis leads to systemic metabolic disarray that adversely affects multiple organs, placing abnormal lipid metabolism associated with NAFLD in close relation to many of the current life-style-related diseases.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abeta oxidation 3abiochemical pathways 3acytochromes 3adisease course 3afatty acids 3afatty liver 3ahomeostasis 3alipogenesis 3aliver 3amitochondria 3amortality 3aoxidation 3aoxidative stress 3aperoxisomes 3auptake mechanisms1 aLykkesfeldt, Jens1 aTveden-Nyborg, Pernille0 tCellular and molecular life sciences.g2018 Sept., v. 75, no. 18 p.3313-3327dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl55291x1420-682X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00018-018-2860-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01978naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245016800171300001400339520068400353592002801037650001201065650002201077650002301099650001601122650001701138650001501155650001101170650001001181653001801191653001301209653001301222653001901235653002201254700002001276700001901296700002001315700002001335773010501355856008701460852000901547655001201556IND60581210020221118133717.0180830e20170920xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058121002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2017.05.0782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTsuji, Takeshi10aMorphological changes from spherical silver nanoparticles to cubes after laser irradiation in acetone–water solutions via spontaneous atom transportation process  ap. 33-37.  aMorphological changes were studied in spherical silver nanoparticles (NPs) prepared using laser ablation of silver plates in an acetone–water mixed solution after laser irradiation. When reagent solutions were left for 1–14days after laser irradiation, Ag nanocrystals (NCs) involving cubes formed spontaneously. Results show that laser irradiation and acetone are unnecessary for cube formation, but they enhance the cube formation efficiency because of the spherical NP size reduction. These findings suggest that cube formation occurs via an atom transportation process resembling that which occurs in the ripening process of NPs prepared using chemical reduction methods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetone 3aaqueous solutions 3achemical reduction 3airradiation 3ananocrystals 3ananosilver 3asilver 3awater 0aNanoparticles 0aColloids 0aRipening 0aLaser ablation 0aLaser irradiation1 aKikuchi, Makoto1 aKagawa, Takuya1 aAdachi, Hiroaki1 aTsuji, Masaharu0 tColloids and surfaces.g2017 Sept. 20, v. 529 p.33-37dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2017.05.0783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02935naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245014200177300001600319520146600335592002801801650002801829650002301857650002801880650001601908650001501924650001801939650001201957650001501969650002101984650002802005650001002033650001102043650002102054650001402075650001402089653001002103653001702113653002302130700001802153700001402171700002002185700001602205700001602221773011002237856008502347852000902432655001202441IND60602314220221118065223.0180711e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060231422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.exppara.2015.08.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPérez-Gordones, M.C.10aPresence of a thapsigargin-sensitive calcium pump in Trypanosoma evansi: Immunological, physiological, molecular and structural evidences  ap. 107-117.  aIn higher eukaryotes, the sarco-endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca²⁺-ATPase (SERCA) is characterized for its high sensitivity to low concentrations of thapsigargin (TG), a very specific inhibitor. In contrast, SERCA-like enzymes with different sensitivities to TG have been reported in trypanosomatids. Here, we characterized a SERCA-like enzyme from Trypanosoma evansi and evaluated its interaction with TG. Confocal fluorescence microscopy using BODIPY FL TG and specific anti-SERCA antibodies localized the T. evansi SERCA-like enzyme in the ER and confirmed its direct interaction with TG. Moreover, the use of either 1 μM TG or 25 μM 2′,5′-di (tert-butyl)-1,4-benzohydroquinone prevented the reuptake of Ca²⁺ and consequently produced a small increase in the parasite cytosolic calcium concentration in a calcium-free medium, which was released from the ER pool. A 3035 bp-sequence coding for a protein with an estimated molecular mass of 110.2 kDa was cloned from T. evansi. The corresponding gene product contained all the invariant residues and conserved motifs found in other P-type ATPases but lacked the calmodulin binding site. Modeling of the three-dimensional structure of the parasite enzyme revealed that the amino acid changes found in the TG-SERCA binding pocket do not compromise the interaction between the enzyme and the inhibitor. Therefore, we concluded that T. evansi possesses a SERCA-like protein that is inhibited by TG.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCa2-transporting ATPase 3aTrypanosoma evansi 3aadenosinetriphosphatase 3aamino acids 3aantibodies 3abinding sites 3acalcium 3acalmodulin 3aeukaryotic cells 3afluorescence microscopy 3agenes 3amodels 3amolecular weight 3aparasites 3areticulum 0aSERCA 0aThapsigargin 0aTrypanosoma evansi1 aSerrano, M.L.1 aRojas, H.1 aMartínez, J.C.1 aUzcanga, G.1 aMendoza, M.0 tExperimental parasitology.g2015 Dec., v. 159 p.107-117dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45466x0014-48947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.exppara.2015.08.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02996naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002000155245009700175520145700272592002801729650002501757650001901782650001001801650001601811650001201827650001201839650001201851650001201863650002301875650001501898650001001913650001501923650001601938650002501954650002801979650001302007653001402020653001302034653001502047653001202062653002002074700002202094700002402116700002302140700002202163700002802185700002602213700002502239773009102264856009002355852000902445655001202454IND60758332420221120132710.0220124e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075833242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1329972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIslam, Rafiquel10aEstrogenic mixtures induce alterations in lipidomic profiles in the gonads of female oysters  aThis study aimed to reveal possible alterations to lipidomic profiles in Sydney rock oysters, Saccostrea glomerata, exposed to estrogenic mixtures (i.e., estrone, E1; 17β-estradiol, E2; estriol, E3; 17α-ethinylestradiol, EE2; bisphenol A, BPA; 4-t-octylphenol, 4-t-OP; and 4-nonylphenol, 4-NP) at “low” and “high” concentrations, typical of those detected in Australian and global receiving waters. A seven-day acute exposure window exhibited significantly lower abundances of many non-polar metabolites in digestive gland, gills, and gonads. Overall, there was a strong effect of the carrier solvent ethanol (despite a low exposure of 0.0002%), with all solvent containing treatments exhibiting lower abundances of lipidic metabolites, especially in the gill and digestive gland. No significant changes of the lipidome were exhibited in the male gonad by estrogenic exposure. However, in the female gonad, significant reductions of phospholipids and phosphatidylcholine were associated with exposure to high estrogenic mixtures. We hypothesise that the decreases in these phospholipids in the female gonad may be attributable to 1) lower algal consumption and thus lower uptake of lipidic building blocks; 2) a reduction of available substrates for phospholipid and phosphatidylcholine synthesis; and/or 3) induction of reactive oxygen species via estrogen metabolism, which may cause lipid peroxidation and lower abundance of phospholipids.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSaccostrea glomerata 3aacute exposure 3aalgae 3abisphenol A 3aestriol 3aestrone 3aethanol 3afemales 3alipid peroxidation 3alipidomics 3amales 3ametabolism 3ametabolites 3aphosphatidylcholines 3areactive oxygen species 3asolvents 0aEstrogens 0aLipidome 0aMetabolome 0aMollusc 0aSolvent effects1 aMelvin, Steven D.1 aKit Yu, Richard Man1 aO'Connor, Wayne A.1 aAnh Tran, Thi Kim1 aAndrew-Priestley, Megan1 aLeusch, Frederic D.L.1 aMacFarlane, Geoff R.0 tChemosphere.g2022 Mar., v. 291 p.132997-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1329973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02754naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245013300167300001400300520108400314592002801398650002401426650002401450650001901474650001601493650002201509650001101531650001401542650002701556650001201583650002301595650001601618650001401634650001001648650001101658650002101669650001101690653003401701653001101735653002701746653002901773653002101802700001501823700002101838700001401859700002201873700001501895700001901910700001801929700001401947700001501961773010401976856008702080852000902167655001202176IND60560559520221122031241.0190409e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056055952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2016.12.0892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Rong10aMethanogenic degradation of toilet-paper cellulose upon sewage treatment in an anaerobic membrane bioreactor at room temperature  ap. 69-76.  aToilet-paper cellulose with rich but refractory carbon sources, are the main insoluble COD fractions in sewage. An anaerobic membrane bioreactor (AnMBR) was configured for sewage treatment at room temperature and its performance on methanogenic degradation of toilet paper was highlighted. The results showed, high organic removal (95%), high methane conversion (90%) and low sludge yield (0.08gVSS/gCOD) were achieved in the AnMBR. Toilet-paper cellulose was fully biodegraded without accumulation in the mixed liquor and membrane cake layer. Bioconversion efficiency of toilet paper approached 100% under a high organic loading rate (OLR) of 2.02gCOD/L/d and it could provide around 26% of total methane generation at most of OLRs. Long sludge retention time and co-digestion of insoluble/soluble COD fractions achieving mutualism of functional microorganisms, contributed to biodegradation of toilet-paper cellulose. Therefore the AnMBR successfully implemented simultaneously methanogenic bioconversion of toilet-paper cellulose and soluble COD in sewage at room temperature.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3aanaerobic digestion 3abiodegradation 3abioreactors 3abiotransformation 3acarbon 3acellulose 3achemical oxygen demand 3amethane 3amethane production 3amethanogens 3amutualism 3apaper 3asewage 3asewage treatment 3asludge 0aAnaerobic membrane bioreactor 0aSewage 0aToilet-paper cellulose 0aMethanogenic degradation 0aRoom temperature1 aNie, Yulun1 aKatō, Hiroyuki,1 aWu, Jiang1 aUtashiro, Tetsuya1 aLu, Jianbo1 aYue, Shangchao1 aJiang, Hongyu1 aZhang, Lu1 aLi, Yu-You0 tBioresource technology.g2017 Mar., v. 228 p.69-76dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2016.12.0893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03336naa a2200865 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245011900170520111400289592002801403650002001431650002001451650002301471650001701494650002401511650001401535650001201549650002201561650001201583650002201595650001601617650003001633650001101663650001101674650001001685650001401695650002301709650001601732650002901748650000901777650002401786650001601810650001301826650001501839650002101854653000801875653000801883653001001891653000901901653000801910653001001918653000801928653000901936653000801945653000701953653000701960653000701967653000901974653000801983653000601991653001001997653000802007653000802015653000902023653000802032653000702040653002102047653001902068653001402087653001502101653003402116653001802150700001702168700001602185700002502201700002802226773010902254856008602363852000902449655001202458IND60737485120221122215826.0220606e20210901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073748512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2021.1182162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheng, Wai-Yin10aCircadian disruption-induced metabolic syndrome in mice is ameliorated by oat β-glucan mediated by gut microbiota  aCircadian disruption-induced metabolic syndrome (CDIMS) involves body weight gain, changes in blood profile and gut microbiota. In this study, CDIMS was induced by shifted light dark cycle (SLDC) in C57BL/6J mice. Dietary intervention by oral administration of oat β-glucan (a polymeric prebiotic) alleviated CDIMS when compared to chicory inulin/fructan (an oligomeric prebiotic) and melatonin (a chronobiotic). Oat β-glucan reversed the increase in body weight, liver weight-to-body weight ratio and plasma leptin concentration as well as restored glucose tolerance. In altering gut microbiota, oat β-glucan increased the species richness, reversed the populations of 7 bacterial genera and increased butyrate producers including Ruminococcaceae and Lachnospiraceae which enhance gut barrier protection and regulate glucose homeostasis. Correlation analysis demonstrated the linking of the alleviation of CDIMS by prebiotics and melatonin with different microbial metabolic pathways involved in energy metabolism, biosynthesis of metabolites, metabolism of cofactors and vitamins and endocrine synthesis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLachnospiraceae 3aRuminococcaceae 3aabsorption barrier 3abiosynthesis 3abody weight changes 3abutyrates 3achicory 3aenergy metabolism 3aglucose 3aglucose tolerance 3ahomeostasis 3aintestinal microorganisms 3ainulin 3aleptin 3aliver 3amelatonin 3ametabolic syndrome 3ametabolites 3anutritional intervention 3aoats 3aoral administration 3aphotoperiod 3apolymers 3aprebiotics 3aspecies richness 0aASV 0aAUC 0aCDIMS 0aCLDC 0aGLM 0aH & E 0aITT 0aKEGG 0aLFC 0aMW 0aNB 0aNS 0aOGTT 0aSBG 0aS 0aSCFAs 0aSCN 0aSIN 0aSLDC 0aSME 0aZT 0aCircadian rhythm 0aChicory inulin 0aMelatonin 0aMicrobiota 0aNon-digestible polysaccharide 0aOat β-glucan1 aLam, Ka-Lung1 aLi, Xiaojie1 aKong, Alice Pik-Shan1 aCheung, Peter Chi-Keung0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2021 Sept. 01, v. 267 p.118216-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2021.1182163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03668naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005600147245011500203300001100318520192100329592002802250650001702278650002602295650001802321650002202339650001402361650001702375650001202392650002002404650002302424650001402447650002102461650001502482650001202497650001102509650002902520650001502549650003302564650001302597650001902610650002302629650001402652700006502666700001902731700001902750700002702769700002502796700002202821700006802843773011202911856008203023852000903105655001203114IND60682691220221119195307.0210216e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068269122DNAL7 a10.1007/s12038-020-0005-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNain, Zulkar1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0819-313710aComputational prediction of active sites and ligands in different AHL quorum quenching lactonases and acylases  ap. 26.  aWith the emergence of multidrug-resistant ‘superbug’, conventional treatments become obsolete. Quorum quenching (QQ), enzyme-dependent alteration of quorum sensing (QS), is now considered as a promising antimicrobial therapy because of its potentiality to impede virulence gene expression without resulting in growth inhibition and antibiotic resistance. In our study, we intended to compare between two major QQ enzyme groups (i.e., AHL lactonases and AHL acylases) in terms of their structural and functional aspects. The amino acid composition-based principal component analysis (PCA) suggested that probably there is no structural and functional overlapping between the two groups of enzymes as well as within the lactonase enzymes but the acylases may functionally be affected by one another. In subcellular localization analysis, we also found that most lactonases are cytoplasmic while acylases are periplasmic. Investigation on the secondary structural features showed random coil dominates over α-helix and β-sheet in all evaluated enzymes. For structural comparison, the tertiary structures of the selected proteins were modelled and submitted to the PMDB database (Accession ID: PM0081007 to PM0081018). Interestingly, sequence alignment revealed the presence of several conserved domains important for functions in both protein groups. In addition, three amino acid residues, namely aspartic acid, histidine, and isoleucine, were common in the active sites of all protein models while most frequent ligands were found to be 3C7, FEO, and PAC. Importantly, binding interactions of predicted ligands were similar to that of native QS signal molecules. Furthermore, hydrogen bonds analysis suggested six proteins are more stable than others. We believe that the knowledge of this comparative study could be useful for further research in the development of QS-based universal antibacterial strategies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive sites 3aantibiotic resistance 3aaspartic acid 3acomparative study 3adatabases 3adrug therapy 3aenzymes 3agene expression 3agrowth retardation 3ahistidine 3ahydrogen bonding 3aisoleucine 3aligands 3amodels 3amultiple drug resistance 3aprediction 3aprincipal component analysis 3aproteins 3aquorum sensing 3asequence alignment 3avirulence1 aAdhikari, Utpal Kumar1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0754-86641 aAbdulla, Faruq1 aHossain, Nahid1 aBarman, Nirmal Chandra1 aMansur, Fariha Jasin1 aAzakami, Hiroyuki1 aKarim, Mohammad Minnatul1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5383-62880 tJournal of biosciences.g2020 Dec., v. 45, no. 1 p.26-26dSpringer IndiawJournal:jnl31976x0250-59917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12038-020-0005-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03388naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245011200174300001800286520215600304592002802460650002002488650002802508650001502536650001802551650001502569650001802584650002602602650000902628650002202637650001602659650001302675653002202688653002102710653001502731653001902746700002002765773009802785856008602883852000902969655001202978IND60678433320221119021728.0200217e20200211xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067843332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2019.11.0782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorse-Brady, Jesse10aPrevalence and types of vaccination errors from 2009 to 2018: A systematic review of the medical literature  ap. 1623-1629.  aVaccination practices and the programmatic factors that influence them are essential for public health. Several barriers impact vaccination efforts, including vaccination errors, which pose the risk of reduced population-wide vaccination efficacy and individual adverse drug events. This study aimed to define the prevalence of vaccination errors documented in English language medical literature between 2009 and 2018 and to identify the common types of errors that occurred during this period.This systematic review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P) guidelines. The study protocol was registered with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews prior to research activities. The Cochrane Library, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Google Scholar, ProQuest Central, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science were searched using predetermined search terms. Included data were from primary studies or retrospective analyses that assessed the prevalence and/or type of vaccination errors and that were peer-reviewed, conducted between 2009 and 2018, and published in English. Data were extracted using the Cochrane Data Extraction and Assessment Template and assessed using the Appraisal tool for Cross-Sectional Studies. Pooled vaccination error prevalence was then calculated.Of the 1310 independent records that were identified and screened, 17 studies from five countries met all inclusion criteria. Pooled vaccination error prevalence was calculated to be 1.15 per 10,000 vaccine doses (range, 0.005–141.69 per 10,000 doses). The most commonly reported vaccination errors were “wrong vaccine administered” and “off-schedule administration.”International rates of vaccination error reporting remain low, with few reports of significant adverse reactions. Vaccination programs should consider the impact of vaccination errors on individual and population health, particularly focusing on the impact of “wrong vaccine” administration. Continued monitoring and promotion of error reporting will enable further understanding of this topic.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3across-sectional studies 3aguidelines 3ameta-analysis 3amonitoring 3apublic health 3aretrospective studies 3arisk 3asystematic review 3avaccination 3avaccines 0aVaccination error 0aError prevalence 0aError type 0aVaccine safety1 aMarie Hart, Ann0 tVaccine.g2020 Feb. 11, v. 38, no. 7 p.1623-1629dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2019.11.0783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03580naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006400148245012400212300001600336520214800352592002802500596005202528650001802580650001302598650001402611650001102625650002402636650002202660650001302682650001202695650001302707650002102720650002702741650001202768650002602780650001002806650001102816700002402827700002202851700001702873700003102890773010902921856008303030852000903113655001203122IND60768688820221123035845.0220301e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076868882DNAL7 a10.1007/s00468-021-02187-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBandupriya, H.

Genetic stability of regenerated coconut plants was confirmed using simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. Micropropagation of coconut provides a way for a large-scale propagation of elite coconut cultivars for both local and international markets. The use of micropropagated plants in coconut industry depends on the evidence to prove that such materials are not divergent from ordinary plant materials produced through conventional methods. The present study was designed to evaluate the genetic fidelity and various morphological, agronomical, physiological and fruit nutrient component parameters of similar aged micropropagated and seed-derived hybrid coconut CRIC65, after 12 years of growth in the field. Molecular characterization using simple sequence repeat markers (SSR) provides assurance of genetic fidelity of regenerated palms by scoring identical alleles at the genomic SSR loci tested in the study. Sugar profiles of coconut water and proximate compositions of the coconut kernel showed no significant differences between micropropagated and seed-propagated progenies. Micropropagated coconut palms had an overall physiological performance similar to seed-derived palms. While the majority of the fruit components were statistically similar between the micropropagated and seed-derived progenies, a few economically important components of the fruits such as nut weight, kernel fresh weight and kernel dry weight were superior in micropropagated plants. This suggests that the field performance of the clones of CRI65 derived through micropropagation to be comparative or superior depending on the criteria used in the parental selection of hybrid production. Accordingly, in addition to the multiplication of clonal material of genetically improved coconut hybrids micropropagation techniques facilitate the improvement of the clonal progeny by selecting superior mother palms for micropropagation.  aPublisher supplied data  a15 – 124cNational Research Council Sri Lanka 3acoconut water 3acoconuts 3acultivars 3afruits 3agenetic improvement 3agenetic stability 3agenomics 3ahybrids 3aindustry 3amicropropagation 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aprogeny 3aproximate composition 3aseeds 3asugars1 aPerera, S.

Up to now, the PET degradation effect of PETase from Ideonella sakaiensis 201-F6 (IsPETase) variants with low stability and activity was not ideal. In this study, a mutation design tool, Premuse, was developed to integrate the sequence alignment and quantitative selection of the preferred mutations based on natural sequence evolution. Ten single point mutants were selected from 1486 homologous sequences using Premuse, and then two mutations (W159H and F229Y) with improved stability were screened from them. The derived double point mutant, W159H/F229Y, exhibited a strikingly enhanced enzymatic performance. Its Tₘ and catalytic efficiency values (kcₐₜ/Kₘ) respectively increased by 10.4 °C and 2.0-fold using p-NPP as the substrate compared with wild type. The degradation activity for amorphous PET was increased by almost 40-fold in comparison with wild type at 40 °C in 24 h. Additionally, the variant could catalyze biodegradation of PET bottle preform at a mean rate of 23.4 mgPET/h/mgₑₙzyₘₑ. This study allowed us to design the mutation more efficiently, and provides a tool for achieving biodegradation of PET pollution under mild natural environments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aIdeonella 3abiodegradation 3acatalytic activity 3aevolution 3ahumans 3amutants 3amutation 3apollution 3asequence alignment 0aProtein engineering 0aPoly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) biodegradation 0aIsPETase (PETase from Ideonella Sakaiensis)1 aYang, Lixin1 aLiu, Hanqing1 aLi, Qingbin1 aXu, Guoshun1 aZhang, Yan1 aGuan, Feifei1 aZhang, Yuhong1 aZhang, Wei1 aWu, Ningfeng1 aTian, Jian0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2021 June 01, v. 180 p.667-676dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2021.03.0583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02645naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245009500172300001400267520118700281592002801468650002301496650001101519650001501530650001401545650001201559650001901571650000901590650001601599650001901615650002201634650001701656650001401673650001001687650001001697650001001707651001001717653002301727653001501750653002101765653001401786653001401800653002301814700002001837700002101857700001401878700001701892773011001909856008702019852000902106655001202115IND60581437120221120154257.0190318e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058143712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jinsphys.2017.09.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZheng, Jincheng10aAre adult life history traits in oriental fruit moth affected by a mild pupal heat stress?  ap. 36-41.  aThermal stress at one life stage can affect fitness at a later stage in ectotherms with complex life cycles. Most relevant studies have focused on extreme stress levels, but here we also show substantial fitness effects in a moth when pupae are exposed to a relatively mild and sublethal heat stress. We consider the impact of a 35°C heat stress of 2h in three geographically separate populations of the oriental fruit moth (OFM, Grapholita molesta) from northern, middle and southern China. Heat stress negatively affected fecundity but increased adult heat resistance and adult longevity. Fitness effects were mostly consistent across populations but there were also some population differences. In the Shenyang population from northern China, there was a hormetic effect of heat on female longevity not evident in the other populations. Adults from all populations had higher LT50s due to heat stress after pupal exposure to the sublethal stress. These results highlight that the pupal stage is a particularly sensitive window for development and they have implications for seasonal adaptation in uncertain environments as well as changes in pest dynamics under climate warming.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGrapholita molesta 3aadults 3aectothermy 3afecundity 3afemales 3aglobal warming 3aheat 3aheat stress 3aheat tolerance 3ainsect physiology 3alife history 3alongevity 3amoths 3apests 3apupae 3aChina 0aOntogenetic timing 0aLife cycle 0aMild heat stress 0aFecundity 0aLongevity 0aGrapholita molesta1 aCheng, Xiongbin1 aHoffmann, Ary A.1 aZhang, Bo1 aMa, Chun-Sen0 tJournal of insect physiology.g2017 Oct., v. 102 p.36-41dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45772x0022-19107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jinsphys.2017.09.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03129naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245014500170300001600315520173800331592002802069650002302097650002302120650001402143650001502157650001502172650001002187650001202197650001402209650001502223650001602238650001402254650001102268650002502279650002202304650002002326650000802346700002002354700003202374700002402406700002202430700002102452773009602473856008102569852000902650655001202659IND60580760020221118024235.0170929e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058076002DNAL7 a10.1007/s00442-017-3940-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBastias, Daniel A.10aMetabolism or behavior: explaining the performance of aphids on alkaloid-producing fungal endophytes in annual ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum)  ap. 245-256.  aPlant–herbivore interactions are often mediated by plant microorganisms, and the “defensive mutualism” of epichloid fungal endophytes of grasses is an example. These endophytes synthesize bioactive alkaloids that generally have detrimental effects on the performance of insect herbivores, but the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. Our objective was to determine whether changes in the physiology and/or behavior of aphids explain the changes in performance of insects feeding on endophytic plants. We studied the interaction between the aphid Rhopalosiphum padi and the annual ryegrass Lolium multiflorum symbiotic (E+) or not symbiotic (E−) with the fungus Epichloë occultans that can synthesize loline alkaloids. We hypothesized that aphids feeding on E+ plants have higher energetic demands for detoxification of fungal alkaloids, thereby negatively impacting the individual performance, population growth, and structure. Aphids growing on E+ plants had lower values in morphometric and functional variables of individual performance, displayed lower birth rate, smaller population size, and dramatic structural changes. However, aphids exhibited lower values of standard metabolic rate (SMR) on E+ plants, which suggests no high costs of detoxification. Behavioral variables during the first 8 h of feeding showed that aphids did not change the phloem sap ingestion with the presence of fungal endophytes. We hypothesize that aphids may maintain phloem sap ingestion according to their fungal alkaloid tolerance capacity. In other words, when alkaloid concentrations overcome tolerance threshold, ingestion of phloem should decrease, which may explain the observed lower values of SMR in E+ feeding aphids.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLolium multiflorum 3aRhopalosiphum padi 3aalkaloids 3abirth rate 3aendophytes 3afungi 3agrasses 3aingestion 3ametabolism 3amorphometry 3amutualism 3aphloem 3aphytophagous insects 3apopulation growth 3apopulation size 3asap1 aUeno, Andrea C.1 aMachado Assefh, Cristina R.1 aAlvarez, Adriana E.1 aYoung, Carolyn A.1 aGundel, Pedro E.0 tOecologia.g2017 Oct., v. 185, no. 2 p.245-256dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0029-85497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-017-3940-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01738naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245010300167300001800270520074800288592002801036650002601064650001901090650002601109650001901135700001901154700001701173700001801190700002501208773010101233856008101334852000901415655001201424IND60586715420221120232001.0171214e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058671542DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-017-1719-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, Anuruddh12aA numerical study on anomalous behavior of piezoelectric response in functionally graded materials  ap. 2413-2423.  aFinite element-based simulations have been performed on piezoelectric-based functionally graded materials (FGM). PZT (Lead zirconate titanate) and PVDF (Polyvinylidene fluoride) FGM composites have been investigated. Anomalous enhancement in output voltage has been observed at grading index n = 0.05 (Voltage = 210 V), which is 105 and 185% higher than the original material at n = 0 (PVDF) and n = ∞ (PZT), respectively. Further, role of Young’s modulus, dielectric constant, and piezoelectric constant was systematically investigated to understand this enhancement. It is found that performance of FGM not only relies on piezoelectric constants but also largely depends upon values of Young’s modulus and dielectric constant.  aPublisher supplied data 3adielectric properties 3aelectric power 3amodulus of elasticity 3athermoplastics1 aSharma, Anshul1 aVaish, Rahul1 aKumar, Rajeev1 aJain, Satish Chandra0 tJournal of materials science.g2018 Feb., v. 53, no. 4 p.2413-2423dSpringer USx0022-24617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-017-1719-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02547naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245009100164300001300255520137000268592002801638596005801666650001401724650001601738650001101754650001101765650001901776650001401795650001501809700006201824700002301886700002101909700001901930700002301949773010901972856008302081852000902164655001202173IND60768689220221117170923.0220227e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076868922DNAL7 a10.1007/s10453-021-09728-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiki, Kenji10aEvaluating inaccurate pollen concentrations caused by turbulence using passive sampler  ap. 1-12.  aUnderstanding the atmospheric concentration of pollen (which is one of the most common vectors of allergens) is necessary to determine the atmospheric allergen level. Airborne pollen concentrations were predominantly evaluated using volumetric and gravitational particle samplers. However, no previous studies have successfully shown whether these sampling methods can be used to evaluate actual airborne pollen concentrations. In this study, the relationship between wind speed and sampling efficiency was investigated to determine whether the influence of ambient wind speed on sampling efficiency was significant. To this end, the influence of wind speed was analyzed by comparing a volumetric sampler and a gravitational sampler. The experimental results indicate that an increase in the wind speed results in an increase in the sampling efficiency of the gravitational sampler because of fluctuations in the turbulence. Our simulation shows that when pollen is entrained in the turbulence, the changes in the wind speed, turbulence amplitude, and turbulence length influence the deposition rate of pollen on the gravitational sampler. These influences can be explained by the turbulence vibration model. These results show the inadequacy of existing evaluation methods, not only for pollen deposition data, but also for all types of bioaerosol deposition data.  aPublisher supplied data  a201812315cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science 3aallergens 3abioaerosols 3amodels 3apollen 3aturbulent flow 3avibration 3awind speed1 aKawashima, Shigeto1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7078-44831 aKobayashi, Satoshi1 aTakeuchi, Shinji1 aTseng, Yi-Ting1 aNakamura, Kimihito0 tAerobiologia.g2022 Mar., v. 38, no. 1 p.1-12dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3870027x0393-59657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10453-021-09728-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02056naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245010500172300001600277520078200293592002801075650001901103650001601122650001901138650001701157650001001174650002501184650002001209651002101229653000901250653001501259653001301274653002001287653001001307653002801317700002001345700001901365700001701384700002001401773010701421856008501528852000901613655001201622IND60565374020221122221513.0170323e20170403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056537402DNAL7 a10.1080/19393210.2017.12841592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPark, Shin-Woong10aPolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon levels and risk assessment for food from service facilities in Korea  ap. 143-148.  aIn this study, levels of benzo[a]anthracene, chrysene, benzo[b]fluoranthene, benzo[k]fluoranthene, benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), dibenzo[a,h]anthracene, benzo[g,h,i]perylene and indeno[1,2,3-c,d]pyrene in 412 food items collected from food service facilities in Korea were analysed.

Using dehydroabietic acid as a starting material, a series of rosin-based Gemini surfactants (abbreviated as R-n-R, n = 3, 6, 8 and 10, indicating the carbon atom number contained in the spacer) were synthesized and applied as templates in the preparation of ordered mesoporous silica. The structures and morphologies of the samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscope, transmission electron microscope and N₂ adsorption–desorption. The R-n-R surfactants feature rigid tricyclic hydrophobic groups with large volumes, which are beneficial for the formation of a three-dimensional cubic phase. Furthermore, the spacer length was found to have a tremendous effect on the structure of the prepared mesoporous silica materials. The head group of R-3-R, which has a short spacer, is excessively charged, leading to silica nanoparticles with an irregular morphology and a rather low BET surface area. With longer spacer lengths, R-6-R, R-8-R and R-10-R are conducive to generating silica nanoparticles with a novel dumbbell-like morphology and with higher BET surface areas of 1171, 1096 and 1186 m² g⁻¹, respectively. The results demonstrate the particularities of the Gemini surfactant structure in the preparation of mesoporous silica nanoparticles with novel morphologies, and the details of the molecular interactions that occur in the condensation of silicate anions are also revealed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aanions 3acarbon 3achemical structure 3ahydrophobicity 3ananoparticles 3anitrogen 3aporous media 3ascanning electron microscopes 3asilica 3asilicates 3asurface area 3asurfactants 3atransmission electron microscopes1 aXie, Danhua1 aSong, Binglei1 aFeng, Lin1 aPei, Xiaomei1 aCui, Zhenggang0 tJournal of materials science.g2018 Feb., v. 53, no. 4 p.2434-2442dSpringer USx0022-24617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-017-1709-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02188naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005300151245012900204300001800333520096500351592002801316650002501344650001301369650001801382650002001400650001001420650002001430650001901450650001301469650001301482650001901495650002501514653001601539653001001555700001701565700001501582773009801597856008601695852000901781655001201790IND60678433820221119021616.0200330e20200205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067843382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2019.11.0832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJia, Rong1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6960-619910aEnhancing the immunogenicity of a DNA vaccine against Streptococcus mutans by attenuating the inhibition of endogenous miR-9  ap. 1424-1430.  aDNA vaccine provides a promising method for preventing and treating diseases. However, the low immunogenicity restricts its application. New approaches are urgent to be explored to enhance the immune response of DNA vaccine. MicroRNAs are endogenous, small non-coding RNAs which play parts in gene expression inhibition. In this study, microRNA-9 (miR-9) was found to inhibit the expression of the GLU-A-P antigen protein encoded by the anti-caries DNA vaccine. Mutation of miR-9 binding sites in the gene fragment encoding GLU-A-P antigen protein significantly increased the expression of antigen protein. Moreover, miR-9 sponge can improve the expression of the GLU-A-P antigen protein. The co-immunization with miR-9 sponge and anti-caries DNA vaccine significantly enhanced the specific immune response in vivo. In conclusion, attenuating the inhibition of endogenous miR-9 enhanced the antigen expression and immunogenicity of the anti-caries DNA vaccine.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStreptococcus mutans 3aantigens 3abinding sites 3agene expression 3agenes 3aimmune response 3aimmunogenicity 3amicroRNA 3amutation 3anon-coding RNA 3arecombinant vaccines 0aDNA vaccine 0amiR-91 aYan, Lingyan1 aGuo, Jihua0 tVaccine.g2020 Feb. 05, v. 38, no. 6 p.1424-1430dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2019.11.0833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03388naa a2200769 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002200155245006500177520142800242592002801670650002201698650001301720650002201733650001201755650001601767650002101783650001401804650001301818650001501831650002501846650001701871653001301888653001701901653001501918653001401933653001301947653002401960653000801984653000801992653001602000653000802016653000902024653000802033653000902041653000902050653000802059653000902067653000802076653001002084653000802094653001002102653000802112653000902120653000802129653000902137653000902146653000802155653000902163653000902172653000802181653001002189653001002199700005602209700002402265700005802289700001702347700002902364700002302393773009102416856009002507852000902597655001202606IND60758333020221120102107.0220606e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075833302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1330122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPattnaik, Falguni10aCannabis: Chemistry, extraction and therapeutic applications  aCannabis, a genus of perennial indigenous plants is well known for its recreational and medicinal activities.

Uniformly sized PSt microspheres were prepared by the membrane emulsion polymerization strategy, and then modified by (1) conversing resid ual surface vinyl groups to epoxy groups followed by quaternization, and (2) decorating aromatic ring matrix including nitration, reduction and attachment of glycidyltrimethylammonium chloride. The 3-D morphology and porous features of microspheres were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The surface of the modified PSt became roughness but the particle size remained same. Meanwhile, FT-IR spectra and laser scanning confocal microscope (LCSM) indicated that the modification groups had been successfully covalently coated onto the PSt microspheres. Modified PSt microspheres showed greatly improved hydrophilicity and biocompatibility with 0.387mmol/mL ion exchange capacity (IEC). In the application evaluation procedure, exenatide can be purified from 42.9% (peptide crudes) to 88.6% by modified PSt column with 97.1% recovery yield. This modified PSt microspheres had a large potential in application for efficient separation of peptides.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aanion exchange 3aaromatic compounds 3aatomic force microscopy 3abiocompatibility 3achromatography 3acrosslinking 3aemulsions 3ahydrophilicity 3aparticle size 3apeptides 3apolymerization 3apolystyrenes 3aroughness 3ascanning electron microscopes 3ascanning electron microscopy 0aPolystyrene microspheres 0aHydrophilicity 0aAnion-exchange 0aPeptide separation1 aZhao, Lan1 aZhang, Rongyue1 aHuang, Yongdong1 aZhang, Yan1 aZhang, Kun1 aWu, Xuexing1 aZhang, Zhigang1 aGong, Lan'gu,1 aSu, Zhiguo1 aMa, Guanghui0 tJournal of chromatography.g2016 Apr. 01, v. 1017-1018 p.129-135dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12459x1570-02327nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jchromb.2016.02.0443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03422naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245009800167300001800265520209400283592002802377650002702405650001702432650001302449650002402462650001102486650001302497650001202510650003502522650001602557650001902573650001902592650001602611650002102627651001102648651001302659700002102672700001502693700002202708700001602730700001602746773011202762856008102874852000902955655001202964IND60580760320221118024414.0170929e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058076032DNAL7 a10.1007/s10531-017-1380-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRosalino, L. M.10aConservation priorities for elementary school students: Neotropical and European perspectives  ap. 2675-2697.  aNature conservation can only be an efficient process if involving different society actors, especially those that have long-term and multiplying effects on how society relates with nature, such as children/students. To delineate nature conservation strategies, we need to understand the drivers that shape peoples’ behaviors and attitudes towards nature; for students this is mostly determined by their past experience and influence of their socio-economic and familiar context. To test these assumptions, we develop a study focused on elementary school students from Portugal and Brazil. In each country we selected two student’s groups representing two distinct socio-environmental contexts: rural and urban populations. Based on a written questionnaire, we aimed at understanding the effect of parental and socio-environmental contexts, gender, prior contact with nature and online news-associated environmental information, on how students prioritize taxa to be conserved. Furthermore, we analyzed how health, economic and touristic values constrain pro-conservation attitudes. Students from urban areas and from Portugal showed a lower probability of having a pro-conservation attitude. Brazilian and rural students may have a more frequent contact with nature and live in regions of higher biodiversity, two factors that may act synergistically to produce those patterns. Positive attitudes towards conservation seem to be over-ruled by health (i.e. self-preservation) and economical (i.e. financial subsistence) interests and values. Moreover, students prioritize for conservation species that are commonly mentioned in the online news, particularly mammals, and plants. Acknowledging that students rank higher health and economical values over conservation ones, as well as the perceptible importance of contacting with nature and the apparent relevance of online news as information vehicles, may increase the chances of improving the efficacy of nature conservation strategies. Furthermore, this information can lead to an improvement of environmental awareness and literacy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aattitudes and opinions 3abiodiversity 3achildren 3aelementary students 3agender 3aliteracy 3amammals 3anatural resources conservation 3aprobability 3aquestionnaires 3asocioeconomics 3aurban areas 3aurban population 3aBrazil 3aPortugal1 aGheler-Costa, C.1 aSantos, G.1 aGonçalves, M.

The solvent bar microextraction was based on applying hydrophobic ionic liquid to the lumen and wall pores of a hollow fiber. The main factors influencing the extraction including types of ionic liquid, stirring speed, extraction time, extraction temperature, and salt effect were investigated. The proposed method was successfully applied in the analysis of real environmental water samples under the optimal extraction conditions and good spiked recoveries of 86.71–103.7% were obtained. The linear range was 1–200 μg L⁻¹ and the detection limits were 0.015–0.026 μg L⁻¹ for the four OPPs analyzed. These results demonstrated that solvent bar microextraction was a simple and accurate technique with a high enrichment factor.  aPublisher supplied data 3adetection limit 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahydrophobicity 3aionic liquids 3amicroextraction 3amixing 3aorganophosphorus pesticides 3atemperature1 aWang, Ruoyu1 aSu, Ping1 aYang, Yi0 tAnalytical methods.g2013 Sept. 12, v. 5, no. 19 p.5074-5078dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3ay40803e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02808naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100003300144245013700177500001900314520150400333592002801837650001301865650002501878650001201903650001501915650001601930650001501946650001101961650002201972650001301994650002402007650002202031650003302053700002602086700002902112700003102141700001902172773012002191856007802311852000902389655001202398IND60735268220221120052053.0210423e20210401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073526822DNAL7 a10.3390/plants100406822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIsmail-Suhaimy, Noor  Wahida10aOptimizing Conditions for Microwave-Assisted Extraction of Polyphenolic Content and Antioxidant Activity of Barleria lupulina Lindl.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aBarleria lupulina Lindl. (Acanthaceae) as an ornamental plant has been widely used in folklore medicine due to its abundancy in polyphenolic compounds. The present study examined conditions for optimal extraction of antioxidants from B. lupulina leaf extracts by using the microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) method. The effects of ethanol concentrations, microwave power, and extraction time on total phenolic content (TPC), total flavonoid content (TFC), 1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), and 2,20-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothizoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) were investigated by single-factor experiments. Response surface methodology (RSM) was applied to observe interactions of three independent variables (ethanol concentrations, microwave power, and extraction time) on the dependent variables (TPC, TFC, DPPH, and ABTS) to establish optimal extraction conditions. Quadratic polynomial equations in all experimental models yielded favorably with fitted models with R² and R²ₐdⱼ of more than 0.90 and a non-significant lack of fit at p > 0.05. The optimal conditions for the extraction of antioxidant activity were established at 80% (v/v) ethanol, 400 W, and 30 s with TPC (238.71 mg gallic acid equivalent (GAE)/g sample), TFC (58.09 mg QE/g sample), DPPH (87.95%), and ABTS (89.56%). Analysis by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography–quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QTOF/MS) successfully identified four new phenylethanoid glycoside compounds in the species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBarleria 3aantioxidant activity 3aethanol 3aflavonoids 3agallic acid 3aglycosides 3aleaves 3amass spectrometry 3amedicine 3amicrowave treatment 3aornamental plants 3aresponse surface methodology1 aGani, Siti  Salwa Abd1 aZaidan, Uswatun  Hasanah1 aHalmi, Mohd  Izuan Effendi1 aBawon, Paiman 0 tPlants.g2021 Apr. 01, v. 10, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21620x2223-77477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants100406823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02852naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002700151245012900178300001600307500001900323520118400342536022601526592002801752596002001780650001601800650001701816650001801833650001101851650002201862650002101884650002201905650001601927650001501943651001101958653001601969653002001985653001602005653002002021653002002041653002202061700003102083700003102114700002002145773011102165856008502276852000902361655001202370IND60715445820221118052002.0201026e20201001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071544582DNAL7 a10.1080/01650424.2020.17978182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRazo-González, María10aPreliminary evaluation of the nocturnal flight of caddisflies (Insecta: Trichoptera) in a temperate forest in Oaxaca, Mexico  ap. 339-355.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis study examined the flight activity of adult caddisflies (order Trichoptera) in a pine-oak forest in México. Specimens were collected near the locality of Puente de los Trabajos, Sierra de Juárez, Oaxaca State using blacklight traps during four nights between 28 October and 13 November 2015. A total of 1117 specimens were collected, belonging to 10 families, 18 genera, and 28 species. Limnephilus tulatus Denning, 1962, Polycentropus casicus Denning and Sykora, 1966 and the genus Mayatrichia Mosely, 1937 are recorded for the first time from Oaxaca State. Activity and species diversity peaked between 18:00 and 19:30 h. More than 90% of all species observed had been recorded by 00:30 h, and 100% by 05:30 h. Abundance and species richness were significantly correlated with temperature and relative humidity. We found that the seasonal activity of Ochrotrichia yavesia Bueno-Soria and Holzenthal, 2004, increases in late October. Environmental variables as precipitation, wind speed and direction should also be considered, and additional sampling in different seasons of the year in other localities with different environmental conditions is also recommended.  aPosgrado en Ciencias Biológicas program of the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México for financial support during first author doctoral studies.

Two types of derivatives corresponding to distinct structuration levels were prepared from a single technical lignin sample (PB1000): phenol-enriched oligomer fractions and colloidal nanoparticles (CLP). The raw lignin and its derivatives were formulated with cellulose nanocrystals or nanofibrils to prepare films by chemical oxidation or pressure-assisted filtration. The films were tested for their water and lignin retention capacities, radical scavenging capacity (RSC) and antimicrobial properties. A structural investigation was performed by infrared, electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy and microscopy. The composite morphology and performance were controlled by both the composition and structuration level of lignin. Phenol-enriched oligomers were the compounds most likely to interact with cellulose, leading to the smoothest film surface. Their RSC in film was 4- to 6-fold higher than that of the other samples. The organization in CLP led to the lowest RSC but showed capacity to trap and stabilize phenoxy radicals. All films were effective against S. aureus (gram negative) whatever the lignin structure. The results show the possibility to tune the performances of these composites by exploiting lignin multi-scale structure.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodegradability 3acellulose 3aelectron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy 3afiltration 3alignin 3alignocellulose 3amicroscopy 3ananocrystals 3ananofibers 3aoxidation 0aProtobind 1000 0aColloid lignin particles (CLP) 0aCellulose nanocomposite 0aAntioxidant and antibacterial properties 0aPhenoxy radicals 0aElectron paramagnetic resonance1 aRivière, G.N.1 aFoulon, L.1 aFrapart, Y.M.1 aCottyn, B.1 aPernes, M.1 aMarcuello, C.1 aGodon, B.1 aGainvors-Claisse, A.1 aCrônier, D.1 aMajira, A.1 aÖsterberg, M.1 aKurek, B.1 aBaumberger, S.1 aAguié-Béghin, V.0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2021 June 30, v. 181 p.136-149dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2021.03.0813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02175naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245010900175300001600284500001900300520083700319536010401156592002801260596006101288650001001349650001201359650001101371650001701382650001801399653002401417653002601441653001501467653002401482653002401506653002201530700002001552773011101572856008501683852000901768655001201777IND60715445920221118052040.0201026e20201001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071544592DNAL7 a10.1080/01650424.2020.18040652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatsushima, Ryosuke10aFlight capacities of three species of diving beetles (Coleoptera: Dytiscidae) estimated in a flight mill  ap. 332-338.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aTo understand the life history strategies of diving beetles, it is important to obtain information regarding their flight capacities. We estimated the flight capacities of three dytiscid species in Japan using a flight mill. The mean flight distances of Hydaticus bowringii Clark, 1864, Hydaticus grammicus (Germar, 1827), and Rhantus suturalis (MacLeay, 1825) were 5.16, 1.97, and 0.58 km, respectively. Some individuals flew extremely long distances: 20.01 km in H. bowringii and 12.58 km in H. grammicus. The two representatives of the genus Hydaticus Leach, 1817 overwinter on land, far from water bodies or in the mud near emergent plants on the shore of water bodies; R. suturalis uses various water bodies throughout the year. The differences in overwintering sites may be reflected in the species’ flight capacities.  aThis work was supported by the program of Advancing Researcher Experience in University of Tsukuba.  aPublisher supplied data  cAdvancing Researcher Experience in University of Tsukuba 3aJapan 3aRhantus 3aflight 3alife history 3aoverwintering 0adispersal potential 0alife history strategy 0aDytiscidae 0aHydaticus bowringii 0aHydaticus grammicus 0aRhantus suturalis1 aYokoi, Tomoyuki0 tAquatic insects.g2020 Oct. 1, v. 41, no. 4 p.332-338dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl31190x1744-41527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01650424.2020.18040653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03500naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003700151245012200188300001600310520189900326592002802225650002802253650002002281650001202301650001302313650001802326650001702344650001602361650001602377650001102393650001502404650002602419650001902445650001202464650001302476650001502489653001902504653001302523653002002536653002802556653002202584653002602606653002502632653002602657653001202683653001502695700006502710773010002775856008602875852000902961655001202970IND60565077120221120202901.0190214e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056507712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anbehav.2017.02.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlmeida de Carvalho, Maria João10aFood intake and food choice are altered by the developmental transition at critical weight in Drosophila melanogaster  ap. 195-208.  aAn animal's metabolism changes throughout development, obliging the animal to coordinate its feeding behaviour with its stage-specific nutritional requirements. Previous studies in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster showed that the developmental transition known as critical weight alters the response to nutrition in larvae; starvation reduces survival and dramatically delays development in precritical weight larvae, whereas it has more moderate effects on survival and accelerates development in postcritical weight larvae. We thus hypothesized that this change in sensitivity to nutrition might result in differences in feeding behaviour between the two stages. Using both no-choice and two-choice assays, we found that pre- and postcritical weight larvae had similar strategies for macronutrient balancing, both regulating protein intake at the cost of under- or overconsuming carbohydrates. Despite these similarities, precritical weight larvae regulated protein intake within more narrow limits than postcritical weight larvae. In addition, the larvae showed significant differences in the way they regulated macronutrient intake in the presence of bitter, potentially noxious compounds. Whereas precritical weight larvae avoided bitter food and showed only mild deficiencies in protein intake, postcritical weight larvae responded to these compounds by consuming less. When larvae were forced to choose between a higher quality diet tainted with quinine or caffeine and a lower quality diet containing less protein, larvae of both stages showed similar avoidance strategies but precritical weight larvae maintained a more constant protein intake than their postcritical weight siblings. Together, our results show that the developmental transition at critical weight modifies larval feeding behaviour, increasing our understanding of how developmental processes influence behaviour.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3aanimal behavior 3aanimals 3acaffeine 3acarbohydrates 3afood choices 3afood intake 3afruit flies 3alarvae 3ametabolism 3anutrient requirements 3aprotein intake 3aquinine 3asiblings 3astarvation 0abitter flavour 0acaffeine 0acritical weight 0aDrosophila melanogaster 0afeeding behaviour 0amacronutrient balance 0anutritional geometry 0aontogeny of behaviour 0aquinine 0atrade-offs1 aMirth, Christen Kerry1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9765-40210 tAnimal behaviour.g2017 Apr., v. 126 p.195-208dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45841x0003-34727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2017.02.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03467naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006400151245011100215300001600326520151900342592002801861650002601889650001901915650001901934650001601953650001501969650001801984650001102002650001602013650001702029650004402046650003002090650001302120650001302133650002902146653001502175653002002190653003102210653001702241653002102258653000802279653001702287700002602304700006002330700002102390700002202411700006402433700006402497700005902561700005502620773013102675856008602806852000902892655001202901IND60769253320220418000000.0220304e20220121xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076925332DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jproteome.1c008322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBispo, Daniela S.

The use of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) for bone regeneration is a promising alternative to conventional bone grafts, and untargeted metabolomics may unveil novel metabolic information on the osteogenic differentiation of MSCs, allowing their behavior to be understood and monitored/guided toward effective therapies. Our results unveiled statistically relevant changes in the levels of just over 30 identified metabolites, illustrating a highly dynamic process with significant variations throughout the whole 21-day period of osteogenic differentiation, mainly involving amino acid metabolism and protein synthesis; energy metabolism and the roles of glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation; cell membrane metabolism; nucleotide metabolism (including the specific involvement of O-glycosylation intermediates and NAD⁺); and metabolic players in protective antioxidative mechanisms (such as glutathione and specific amino acids). Different metabolic stages are proposed and are supported by putative biochemical explanations for the metabolite changes observed. This work lays the groundwork for the use of untargeted NMR metabolomics to find potential metabolic markers of osteogenic differentiation efficacy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acid metabolism 3abone formation 3acell membranes 3aglutathione 3aglycolysis 3aglycosylation 3ahumans 3ametabolites 3ametabolomics 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aoxidative phosphorylation 3aproteome 3aresearch 3atricarboxylic acid cycle 0astem cells 0adifferentiation 0aosteogenic differentiation 0aosteogenesis 0ametabolic switch 0aNMR 0ametabonomics1 aJesus, Catarina S.

Herein, we report the synthesis of boron-containing phenolic–siloxane hybrid polymers through a facile copper-catalysed azide–alkyne click chemistry (CuAAC) approach. For this, phenolic resoles incorporated with boron (PFB) was propargyl-derivatized and then bridged through triazole moieties using telechelic α, ω azidated polydimethylsiloxane (AZ-PDMS). The propargylated boronated PF (PFBPr) resins exhibited high heat of reaction during thermal cure due to the prevalence of multiple reactions. PFBPr-siloxane hybrid co-polymers exhibited glass transitions in the ranges – 100 to – 75 °C and at 25–35 °C corresponding to soft segment and hard segments. Pyrolysed PFBPr-siloxane products showed mixed phase heterogeneous systems of B and SiC. Introduction of boron and silicon improved the degree of graphitization and reduced the graphite crystallite size of the carbonization products. The pyrolysed compounds of silicon and boron formed during high temperature were conducive for creating a layer of void-free graphitic ordered carbon that improved with boron and silicon content, as revealed by SEM images.  aPublisher supplied data 3aboron 3acarbonization 3acomposite polymers 3acrystallites 3agraphene 3aheat 3amoieties 3apolydimethylsiloxane 3aresins 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asilicon 3asilicon carbide 3atemperature 3atriazoles1 aSunitha, K.1 aGayathri, D.

In this study we investigated how P. albinus “choose” to dig their burrows, especially through the study of their burrow densities both in the nebkas and in flat, sandy-surface habitats; the direction of the openings of the burrows; and the influence of wind and vegetation type on the spatial distribution of P. albinus burrows in the nebkas. Several field samplings were carried out in the sandy coastal area of Zarat (Gabès, in the south-eastern part of Tunisia) between January and December 2013. The mean densities of burrows in the two habitats – nebkas and flat, sandy surfaces – were not significantly different. A low positive correlation was observed between burrow density and nebka area. In each nebka, the burrows of P. albinus were localised within a circular belt in a sector facing towards the south, thus avoiding the main wind direction (E–NE). P. albinus prefers to dig their burrows on nebkas covered with Astragalus armatus and Stipagrostis pungens , and avoids those covered with Calicotome villosa . The absence of burrows at the top of the nebkas might be caused by their exposure to sunlight and drying. The lack of burrows at the base of the nebkas is assumed to be the consequence of the presence of non-porous and non-permeable substratum in direct contact with this base. This substratum creates a barrier, which prevents P. albinus from digging sufficiently deep burrows.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAstragalus 3aPorcellio 3aStipagrostis 3acoasts 3adirect contact 3adrying 3ahabitats 3asolar radiation 3avegetation types 3awind direction 3aTunisia 0aterrestrial isopods 0axeric species 0aburrow distribution 0aburrow orientation 0aabiotic factors 0anebka1 aEl-Gtari, Mohamed1 aHamaied, Sonia1 aCharfi-Cheikhrouha, Faouzia0 tEthology, ecology & evolution.g2017 May 4, v. 29, no. 3 p.280-291dTaylor & Francisx1828-71317nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03949370.2016.11616653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02528naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001700144245016000161500001900321520139800340592002801738650002301766650001701789650003101806650002701837650001501864650002201879650001801901700002201919700002201941700002001963773012001983856007802103852000902181655001202190IND60735265120221120082221.0210423e20210330xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073526512DNAL7 a10.3390/plants100406552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDu, Hongmei 10aSingle-Molecule Long-Read Sequencing of Purslane (Portulaca oleracea) and Differential Gene Expression Related with Biosynthesis of Unsaturated Fatty Acids  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis study aimed to obtain the full-length transcriptome of purslane (Portulaca oleracea); assorted plant samples were used for single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing. Based on SMRT, functional annotation of transcripts, transcript factors (TFs) analysis, simple sequence repeat analysis and long non-coding RNAs (LncRNAs) prediction were accomplished. Total 15.33-GB reads were produced; with 9,350,222 subreads and the average length of subreads, 1640 bp was counted. With 99.99% accuracy, after clustering, 132,536 transcripts and 78,559 genes were detected. All unique SMART transcripts were annotated in seven functional databases. 4180 TFs (including transcript regulators) and 7289 LncRNAs were predicted. The results of RNA-seq were confirmed with qRT–PCR analysis. Illumina sequencing of leaves and roots of two purslane genotypes was carried out. Amounts of differential expression genes and related KEGG pathways were found. The expression profiles of related genes in the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids pathway in leaves and roots of two genotypes of purslane were analyzed. Differential expression of genes in this pathway built the foundation of ω-3 fatty acid accumulation in different organs and genotypes of purslane. The aforementioned results provide sequence information and may be a valuable resource for whole-genome sequencing of purslane in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPortulaca oleracea 3abiosynthesis 3agene expression regulation 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aprediction 3asequence analysis 3atranscriptome1 aKhan, Shah Zaman,1 aHu, Shuiqingqing 1 aChe, Shengquan 0 tPlants.g2021 Mar. 30, v. 10, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21620x2223-77477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants100406553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02143naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005600152245010400208300001600312520084100328592002801169650002401197650001201221650001701233650001201250650002501262650001201287650001101299650000901310650002901319650001501348650002001363653001901383653000801402653002201410653002501432653002301457653001101480700001601491773010601507856008701613852000901700655001201709IND60560557320221116231252.0190409e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056055732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2016.12.0672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJana, Kuntal1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0050-765910aEnvironmental impact of biomass based polygeneration – A case study through life cycle assessment  ap. 256-265.  aMulti-generation or polygeneration is considered to be a potential sustainable energy solution. To assess environmental sustainability of multi-generation, life cycle assessment (LCA) is a useful tool. In this paper, environmental impact of polygeneration using an agro waste (rice straw) is assessed by LCA. Then it is compared with stand alone conventional plants with same utility outputs. Power, ethanol, heating and cooling are utility outputs of the polygeneration plant. System boundary for this polygeneration is defined for surplus biomass only. Exergy based allocation method is used for this analysis. Results of LCA are shown through both mid-point and end-point indicators. Results indicate that polygeneration with surplus rice straw is more environment-friendly than conventional stand-alone generation of same utilities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural wastes 3abiomass 3acase studies 3acooling 3aenvironmental impact 3aethanol 3aexergy 3aheat 3arenewable energy sources 3arice straw 3asystem boundary 0aPolygeneration 0aLCA 0aComparative study 0aSensitivity analysis 0aAgricultural waste 0aExergy1 aDe, Sudipta0 tBioresource technology.g2017 Mar., v. 227 p.256-265dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2016.12.0673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02753naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002500144245009500169300001400264520159900278592002801877650001701905650001201922650001001934650001801944650001501962650001501977650002401992651001202016653001202028653001502040653002102055653001602076653001202092700002402104700002602128773011402154856007802268852000902346655001202355IND60609074620221118031120.0180819e20180801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060907462DNAL7 a10.2478/plua-2018-00032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdepoju, Abimbola O.10aWelfare Implications of Domestic Land Grabs Among Rural Households in Delta State, Nigeria  ap. 19-25.  aRural households are displaced from their lands without any plan in place to resettle or compensate them, for a promise of improvement in their living standards. This has not only resulted in a decline in the living standard of the rural populace, in terms of loss of land and livelihoods, the poor are also further marginalized and impoverished. This study examines the welfare implication of domestic land grabs among rural households in Delta State, Nigeria, employing primary data obtained from one hundred and seventy-three representative farming households. Descriptive analysis revealed that majority were low-income earners and engaged in farming as their major occupation. Econometric analysis revealed land size, secondary education, community leaders’ influence, compensation and the use to which the grabbed land was put into as some of the significant factors influencing domestic land grabs in the study area. Further, the size of land grabbed, no compensation for the use of land and low farm output were found to have negative effects on the welfare of the farmers. Thus, the need to intensify efforts to ensure that the rural populace is not being unreasonably dispossessed of its lands, becomes imperative. The need for commensurate compensation of rural households whose lands were grabbed and periodical checks on community leaders who positively influence domestic land acquisitions arbitrarily also becomes pertinent for improvement in the welfare of the farmers. This is especially so, if these small-scale farmers are to be significant drivers of global food security.  aPublisher supplied data 3aeconometrics 3afarmers 3afarms 3afood security 3ahouseholds 3alivelihood 3asecondary education 3aNigeria 0awelfare 0aland grabs 0arural households 0adelta state 0aNigeria1 aEwolor, Scholastica1 aObayelu, Oluwakemi A.0 tRural Sustainability Research.g2018 Aug. 01, v. 39, no. 334 p.19-25dSciendowJournal:23169x2256-09397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/plua-2018-00033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02657naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245011000163300001600273520121200289592002801501650002001529650002401549650001101573650002101584650001601605650002401621650002201645650001501667650001101682650001101693650001401704650002201718653005301740653000801793653001001801653001401811653002201825653001501847700001701862700001401879700001601893700001801909773015701927856008202084852000902166655001202175IND60565074520221120030427.0190426e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056507452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.hpj.2017.02.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLIU, Longbo10aFlavonols Induced by 5-Aminolevulinic Acid Are Involved in Regulation of Stomatal Opening in Apple Leaves  ap. 323-330.  aFlavonols, the main flavonoids in plant leaves, have newly been proposed as a H2O2 scavenger in guard cells. However, whether 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) is involved in regulating stomatal movement of apple (Malus × domestica Borkh. ‘Fuji’) leaves through flavonol accumulation remains unclear. In this study, using diphenylboric acid 2-amino ethyl ester (DPBA, a flavonol fluorescent dye) and a laser scanning confocal microscope, we observed that 5-ALA pretreatment significantly improved flavonol accumulation in guard cells of apple leaves, especially around the nucleus. Then we demonstrated that 5-ALA pretreatment inhibited ABA-induced stomatal closure via decreasing reaction oxygen species (ROS) accumulation in guard cells. Pretreatment with quercetin or kaempferol, two main kinds of flavonols in plants, also inhibited ABA-induced stomatal closure by decreasing ROS content in the guard cells. Furthermore, exogenous flavonols could suppress H2O2-induced stomatal closure in apple leaves. Taken together, we conclude that ALA-induced flavonol accumulation in guard cells is involved in the inhibitory effect of ALA on ABA-induced ROS accumulation and stomatal closure in apple leaves.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMalus domestica 3aaminolevulinic acid 3aapples 3afluorescent dyes 3aguard cells 3ahorticultural crops 3ahydrogen peroxide 3akaempferol 3aleaves 3aoxygen 3aquercetin 3astomatal movement 0aapple (Malus × domestica Borkh. ‘Fuji’) 0aABA 0a5-ALA 0aflavonols 0astomatal aperture 0aguard cell1 aXIONG, Lijun1 aAN, Yuyan1 aZheng, Jie,1 aWANG, Liangju0 tHorticultural plant journal.g2016 Nov., v. 2, no. 6 p.323-330dElsevier B.V.aChinese Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:23309x2468-01417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.hpj.2017.02.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02610naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245008400168300001400252520130800266592002801574650001801602650001501620650001901635650001401654650001501668650001001683650002401693650001101717650001701728650000901745650001101754650003001765650001201795650003001807653001801837653003201855653002101887653000801908700006101916773009701977856008102074852000902155655001202164IND60581434920221120174625.0171005e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058143492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jim.2017.07.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNelson, Renae S.12aA universal phage display system for the seamless construction of Fab libraries  ap. 41-49.  aThe construction of Fab phage libraries requires the cloning of domains from both the light and the heavy chain of antibodies. Despite the advent of powerful strategies such as splicing-by-overlap extension PCR, obtaining high quality libraries with excellent coverage remains challenging. Here, we explored the use of type IIS restriction enzymes for the seamless cloning of Fab libraries. We analyzed human, murine and rabbit germline antibody repertoires and identified combinations of restriction enzymes that exhibit very few or no recognition sites in the antibody sequences. We describe three phagemid vectors, pUP-22Hb, pUP-22Mc and pUP-22Rc, which were employed for cloning the Fab repertoire of these hosts using BsmBI and SapI (human) or SapI alone (mouse and rabbit). Using human serum albumin as a model immunization, we built a mouse/human chimeric Fab library and a mouse Fab library in a single step ligation and successfully panned multiple cognate antibodies. The overall process is highly scalable and faster than PCR-based techniques, with a Fab insertion success rate of around 80%. By using carefully chosen overhangs on each end of the antibody domains, this approach paves the way to the universal, sequence- and vector-independent cloning and reformatting of antibody libraries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA libraries 3aantibodies 3abacteriophages 3achimerism 3agerm cells 3ahosts 3ahuman serum albumin 3ahumans 3aimmunization 3amice 3amodels 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arabbits 3arestriction endonucleases 0aPhage display 0aType IIS restriction enzyme 0aAntibody library 0aFab1 aValadon, Philippe1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7860-30610 tJournal of Immunological Methods.g2017 Nov., v. 450 p.41-49dElsevier B.V.x0022-17597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jim.2017.07.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03002naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002600144245017000170500001900340520146100359592002801820650002001848650001401868650001201882650002201894650001401916650001401930650001501944650002901959650001401988650002502002650001702027650001502044650001402059650001202073700002402085700002702109700002602136700002002162700002002182700002502202700002402227700002502251700002502276773012002301856007802421852000902499655001202508IND60735265320221120082326.0210423e20210330xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073526532DNAL7 a10.3390/plants100406562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStavridou, Evangelia 10aCharacterization of the Genetic Diversity Present in a Diverse Sesame Landrace Collection Based on Phenotypic Traits and EST-SSR Markers Coupled With an HRM Analysis  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aA selection of sesame (Sesamum indicum L.) landraces of different eco-geographical origin and breeding history have been characterized using 28 qualitative morpho-physiological descriptors and seven expressed sequence tag-simple sequence repeat (EST-SSR) markers coupled with a high-resolution melting (HRM) analysis. The most variable qualitative traits that could efficiently discriminate landraces, as revealed by the correlation analyses, were the plant growth type and position of the branches, leaf blade width, stem pubescence, flowering initiation, capsule traits and seed coat texture. The agglomerative hierarchical clustering analysis based on a dissimilarity matrix highlighted three main groups among the sesame landraces. An EST-SSR marker analysis revealed an average polymorphism information content (PIC) value of 0.82, which indicated that the selected markers were highly polymorphic. A principal coordinate analysis and dendrogram reconstruction based on the molecular data classified the sesame genotypes into four major clades. Both the morpho-physiological and molecular analyses showed that landraces from the same geographical origin were not always grouped in the same cluster, forming heterotic groups; however, clustering patterns were observed for the Greek landraces. The selective breeding of such traits could be employed to unlock the bottleneck of local phenotypic diversity and create new cultivars with desirable traits.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSesamum indicum 3acultivars 3aecology 3agenetic variation 3aheterosis 3alandraces 3aleaf blade 3amultidimensional scaling 3aphenotype 3aphenotypic variation 3aplant growth 3aprovenance 3aseed coat 3atexture1 aLagiotis, Georgios 1 aKalaitzidou, Parthena 1 aGrigoriadis, Ioannis 1 aBosmali, Irini 1 aTsaliki, Eleni 1 aTsiotsiou, Stiliani 1 aKalivas, Apostolos 1 aGanopoulos, Ioannis 1 aMadesis, Panagiotis 0 tPlants.g2021 Mar. 30, v. 10, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21620x2223-77477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants100406563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02752naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002000144245009200164300001400256520161500270592002801885650002401913650001201937650001901949650002001968650002301988650001502011650001302026650001502039651001102054653002202065653001802087653002402105653001402129700002202143773011402165856007802279852000902357655001202366IND60609074720221118031024.0180819e20180801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060907472DNAL7 a10.2478/plua-2018-00042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSiksnāne, Ieva10aAnalysis of Precipitation and Runoff Conditions in Agricultural Runoff Monitoring Sites  ap. 26-31.  aIn order to assess the nature of climate change, it is important to analyze the indicators of climate variability in different scales: spatial and temporal. The analysis at different scales can lead to understanding of the nature of variations. Climate change studies are essential for comprehending the nature of global processes, to refine global climate patterns and also develop further research for natural processes (Meinke, Stone, 2005; Hulme et al., 1999). Processes in nature are united, continuous and in constant interaction. Variance of interaction types are immeasurable, types can be connected with different scales and science fields, for example, biological, ecological, physical etc. If interaction is taking place between the land and atmosphere, it is defined as hydrological interaction. As water is significantly important for many purposes on the Earth, it is relevant to analyze precipitation and water runoff on a local scale. In the territory of Latvia, the amount of precipitation exceeds the level of evapotranspiration. Long-term monitoring data show that precipitation leads to average runoff of 250 mm per year (Ziverts, 2004). The monitoring data collected at three research sites located in Latvia was used for this research including Berze (Lielupe river basin, meteorological station in Dobele), Mellupite (Venta river basin, meteorological station in Saldus monitoring) and Vienziemite (Gauja river basin, meteorological station in Zoseni). The results from this study show that there is a pronounced interaction between runoff and precipitation with an average of 53 to 82%.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural runoff 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3adata collection 3aevapotranspiration 3amonitoring 3avariance 3awatersheds 3aLatvia 0aagricultural land 0aprecipitation 0asubsurface drainage 0adischarge1 aLagzdiņš, Ainis0 tRural Sustainability Research.g2018 Aug. 01, v. 39, no. 334 p.26-31dSciendowJournal:23169x2256-09397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/plua-2018-00043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03031naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245009400165300001600259520165200275592002801927650002101955650001101976650001501987650002002002650001602022650001202038650001302050650001502063650001402078650001802092650001302110650001502123650001702138650001902155650001802174651001002192653001802202653001502220653002502235653002402260653001302284700001602297700001902313773011402332856008202446852000902528655001202537IND60565074620221120030321.0190426e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056507462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.hpj.2016.11.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYANG, Xiaozhu10aEffect of Conservation Tillage Practices on Soil Phosphorus Nutrition in an Apple Orchard  ap. 331-337.  aSoil phosphorus (P) is an essential and limiting element for plant growth, which is significantly affected by different approaches to soil management. In order to reveal the effect of different management approaches on soil P and phosphatase activity in 0–20 cm and 20–40 cm soil, this research was conducted to study variations in the characteristics of P and phosphatase activity under 3-year tillage without mulching (CK), no-tillage with corn straw mulching (NTSM) and no-tillage with grass (NTG) in Liaoning apple orchard. The results showed that NTSM and NTG could significantly increase soil P content (P < 0.05) as compared with CK. However, the effect was different between NTSM and NTG; with the NTSM approach, the improvement in the P content in 20–40 cm was remarkable, and in the NTG approach, the improvement in the soil surface P content was significant. At the same time, soil phosphatase activity significantly increased (P < 0.05) under NTSM and NTG. The soil surface and 20–40 cm phosphodiesterase (PD) activity was enhanced under the two management approaches, however, the effect of NTG was stronger than NTSM. In addition, NTSM was more conducive to increasing alkaline phosphomonoesterase (AlP), and NTG was more conducive to increasing acid phosphomonoesterase (AcP). Our findings highlight the variation of dominant mechanisms involved in soil P with different mulching materials application.

That for, a complete characterization is needed, which is the aim of this work. Peltier devices were manually dismantled in three parts: the thermoelectric legs, the alumina plates on which remain the electrical contacts and the silicone paste used to connect the plates. The characterization was performed using five Peltier devices. It includes mass balances of the components, X-ray diffraction analysis of the thermoelectric legs and elemental analysis of each part of the device. It appears that alumina represents 45% of a Peltier device in weight. The electrical contacts are mainly composed of copper and tin, and the thermoelectric legs of bismuth, tellurium and antimony. Thermoelectric legs appear to be Se-doped Bi ₂Te ₃ and (Bi ₀,₅Sb ₁,₅)Te ₃ for n type and p type semiconductors, respectively. This work shows that Peltier devices can be considered as a copper ore and that thermoelectric legs contain high amounts of bismuth, tellurium and antimony compared to their traditional resources.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3aX-ray diffraction 3aaluminum oxide 3aantimony 3abismuth 3acopper 3aenvironmental technology 3alegs 3araw materials 3arefrigeration 3asemiconductors 3asilicone 3atellurium 3atin 0aChemical characterization 0aspent Peltier devices 0aantimony 0abismuth 0atellurium1 aLegeai, Sophie1 aGaroux, Laetitia1 aLeclerc, Nathalie1 aMeux, Eric0 tEnvironmental technology.g2017 Apr. 3, v. 38, no. 7 p.791-797dTaylor & Francisx1479-487X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09593330.2016.12117483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04137naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245016300168300001800331520245700349592002802806650002002834650001402854650001702868650001702885650002402902650002302926650001502949650001302964650001402977650002402991650002603015650002003041650002803061650001803089650001203107650001603119653002003135653003303155653003103188653001403219700001903233700001603252700001403268700001603282700001903298700002103317700002003338700002003358773011303378856008303491852000903574655001203583IND60678431320221119021654.0200913e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067843132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.clnu.2019.11.0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Tong-chao10aNormal BMI predicts the survival benefits of inductive docetaxel, cisplatin, and 5-fluorouracil in patients with locally advanced oral squamous cell carcinoma  ap. 2751-2758.  aThis study aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of the body mass index (BMI), as well as the association with docetaxel, cisplatin, and 5-fluorouracil (TPF) induction chemotherapy in patients with locally advanced oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC).This retrospective study enrolled 253 patients with locally advanced OSCC between 2008 and 2010 based on our previous prospective, randomized, phase 3 trial (NCT01542931). Univariate and multivariate Cox regression models, and the Kaplan–Meier method were used for survival analyses.Among the 253 patients, the BMI at the time of clinical diagnosis ranged from 13.16 to 34.66 kg/m². Smoking status among patients showed a marked correlation with a higher BMI status at the time of clinical diagnosis (tobacco status: P < 0.001). The distribution of clinical nodal (cN) stage was significantly different, as patients with higher BMIs generally had earlier cN stages (P < 0.021) among the different BMI groups. The Kaplan–Meier analysis showed that the BMI was significantly correlated with overall survival (OS, P = 0.004), disease-free survival (DFS, P = 0.005), locoregional recurrence-free survival (LRFS, P = 0.003) and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS, P = 0.007). When the BMI was included in the multivariate Cox regression model adjusted for potentially confounding clinical variables, the BMI was shown to be an independent predictive factor of OS (P = 0.015), DFS (P = 0.015), LRFS (P = 0.009), and DMFS (P = 0.023). The TPF group showed better 5-year clinical survival rates than the control group when analyzing patients with a normal BMI (OS: 64.2% vs. 55.9%; DFS: 54.7% vs. 46.4%; LRFS: 56.6% vs. 49.6%; DMFS: 64.2% vs. 56.0%), but no significant difference was observed. Subgroup survival analysis indicated that patients with a normal BMI and clinical stage IVA disease who accepted TPF induction chemotherapy had a significantly improved OS (HR: 0.425, 95% CI: 0.187–0.966, P = 0.035) and DMFS (HR: 0.425, 95% CI: 0.187–0.966, P = 0.034).The BMI at the time of clinical diagnosis was showed to be an independent predictive factor for patients with locally advanced OSCC. Compared with normoweight patients, underweight patients may have worse clinical outcomes, while overweight and obese patients have a better prognosis. A normal BMI in clinical stage IVA OSCC patients predicts significant OS and DMFS benefits of TPF induction chemotherapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3abody mass index 3acisplatin 3adrug therapy 3afluorouracil 3aimmunologic factors 3anutritional status 3aoverweight 3apatients 3aprognosis 3aregression analysis 3aretrospective studies 3asmoking (habit) 3asquamous cell carcinoma 3asurvival rate 3atobacco 3aunderweight 0aBody mass index 0aOral squamous cell carcinoma 0aTPF induction chemotherapy 0aPrognosis1 aLiang, Si-yuan1 aJu, Wu-tong1 aLiu, Ying1 aTan, Yi-ran1 aZhu, Dong-wang1 aZhang, Chen-ping1 aZhang, Zhi-yuan1 aZhong, Lai-ping0 tClinical nutrition.g2020 Sept., v. 39, no. 9 p.2751-2758dElsevier LtdwJournal:J000000059x0261-56147nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clnu.2019.11.0373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03238naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100001900180245010900199300001800308500002000326506007600346520161200422592002802034506003702062650002202099650003702121650001202158650001902170650001302189650001402202650002302216650001102239650003702250650001902287650001302306650003302319650001602352650003702368700002702405700002002432700002202452700002002474700002302494773013302517856007302650852000902723655001202732IND60586337620221207125545.0171119e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058633762DNAL7 a10.1002/jctb.53712doi7 aPMC56987412pmcid7 a292005852pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOsman, Ahmed I10aSurface hydrophobicity and acidity effect on alumina catalyst in catalytic methanol dehydration reaction  ap. 2952-2962.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Methanol to dimethyl ether (MTD) is considered one of the main routes for the production of clean bio‐fuel. The effect of copper loading on the catalytic performance of different phases of alumina that formed by calcination at two different temperatures was examined for the dehydration of methanol to dimethyl ether (DME). RESULTS: A range of Cu loadings of (1, 2, 4, 6, 10 and 15% Cu wt/wt) on Al₂O₃ calcined at 350 and 550 °C were prepared and characterized by TGA, XRD, BET, NH₃‐TPD, TEM, H₂‐TPR, SEM, EDX, XPS and DRIFT‐Pyridine techniques. The prepared catalysts were used in a fixed bed reactor under reaction conditions in which the temperature ranged from 180–300 °C with weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) = 12.1 h‐¹. It was observed that all catalysts calcined at 550 °C (γ‐Al₂O₃ support phase) exhibited higher activity than those calcined at 350 °C (γ‐AlOOH), and this is due to the phase support change. Furthermore, the optimum Cu loading was found to be 6% Cu/γ‐Al₂O₃ with this catalyst also showing a high degree of stability under steady state conditions and this is attributed to the enhancement in surface acidity and hydrophobicity. CONCLUSION: The addition of copper to the support improved the catalyst properties and activity. For all the copper modified catalysts, the optimum catalyst with high degree of activity and stability was 6% copper loaded on gamma alumina. © 2017 The Authors.

Two different methods, the deformation of colored bands and digital particle image velocimetry have been used to investigate the flow field. Based on the dynamics during the discharge, the entire granular matrix can be divided into different regimes. The evolution of free surface exhibits a self-similarity of its contour. Though the dynamics of granular flow for any position of the orifice exhibits some general trends, eccentricity of the orifice position induces unique complexity in the flow behavior. The proximity of the orifice with the wall induces a noticeable slip on it. This wall slip has a profound effect on the velocity distribution of the vertical flowing region. The rate of discharge has been observed to increase with eccentricity of the orifice position. Further, a detailed analysis of the inclined flow region reveals a unique velocity distribution with three distinct zones and helps to understand the flow physics.  aPublisher supplied data 3adeformation 3aparticle image velocimetry 3apowders 3asilos 0aRectangular silo 0aEccentric discharge 0aWall slip 0aSelf-similarity 0aDPIV 0aVelocity profile1 aDas, Gargi1 aDāsa, Praśānta Kumāra,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3833-51160 tPowder technology.g2016 Nov., v. 301 p.1054-1066dElsevier B.V.x0032-59107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2016.07.0543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01356naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245005800165300001600223520046900239592002800708650001700736650001000753650002800763650002000791650001500811650001300826650001200839773011100851856008300962852000901045655001201054IND60625299420221120105048.0190624e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062529942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cofs.2018.10.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhmed, Jasim10aAdvances in rheological measurements of food products  ap. 127-132.  aThe measurement of food rheology has improved significantly with time and the advent of instrumentation.

These N application rates determine grey WF too, which is also higher in conventional farms (135 l/kg vs. 58 l/kg). In contrast, the amounts of water consumed per kilogram of banana at the farming stage (green plus blue WF) were higher in the organic farms (313 l/kg vs. 289 l/kg), mainly due to their lower yields. No significant correlations were found among both footprints and farm sizes.Moreover, CF and WF have been calculated for the remaining stages of the whole banana value chain up to final consumption in Europe (1.28 kg CO2e/kg banana and 330 l/kg banana at the consumers’ hands, respectively) and complemented with the analysis of the economic contribution of each phase to the final price (1.40 €/kg), to get a more complete picture of this commodity.The farm system was found to be the major contributor to the whole WF, and the second largest (after fruit distribution) to CF. In contrast to the high environmental impacts of farming (which reveal high water and energy consumption), the economic value of this stage is less important than most of the remaining ones, representing only 15% of the final price and showing that wealth distribution along the value chain is still unfair for the farmers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural industry 3abananas 3acarbon footprint 3aclimate change 3acrop production 3aeconomic valuation 3aenergy 3aenvironmental assessment 3aenvironmental impact 3afarmers 3afarming systems 3afertilizer rates 3ahands 3aharvesting 3aincome and wealth 3ainventories 3anitrogen fertilizers 3aprices 3asupply chain 3awashing 3awater footprint 3awater utilization 3aEcuador 3aEurope 0aFood–energy–water nexus 0aCarbon footprint 0aWater use 0aEcuadorian bananas 0aValue chain1 aElbehri, Aziz1 aHospido, Almudena0 tSustainable Production and Consumption.g2015 Apr., v. 2 p.3-16dElsevier B.V.aThe Institution of Chemical EngineerswJournal:23261x2352-55097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.spc.2015.07.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02799naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002200144245011700166300001600283520135800299592002801657650002201685650001301707650001901720650001601739650001701755650001001772650001101782650000901793650002201802650001001824650001401834650001601848650002401864650001301888650001301901650000901914650001801923653001801941653001401959653001701973653001701990700002202007700002002029700002302049773013302072856007902205852000902284655001202293IND60775630220221122160647.0220426e20220421xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077563022DNAL7 a10.7589/JWD-D-21-001442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aViner, Tabitha C.10aAnticoagulant exposure in golden eagle (aquila chrysaetos) power line electrocution and wind turbine mortalities  ap. 348-355.  aGolden Eagles (Aquila chrysaetos) are susceptible to anthropogenic mortality factors, including toxic compounds in the environment such as anticoagulant rodenticides (AR) and sources of man-made energy. The physical and behavioral effects of some toxins may predispose eagles to certain causes of death (COD). To investigate the influence of ARs on mortality of Golden Eagles at wind turbine farms, we randomly tested liver samples from 31 eagles found dead on wind farms and submitted to the National Fish and Wildlife Forensic Laboratory from 2013–20. The comparison group was composed of 31 Golden Eagles sampled during the same time frame with a COD of power line electrocution as a proxy for a relatively lower effort and altitude activity. Associations between COD, AR exposure, sex, and life stage were assessed. In each group, 12 birds (35%) were found to have been exposed to brodifacoum or bromadiolone prior to death. Logistic regression showed no significant association between COD and sex (P=0.194) or life stage (P=0.895). Across both mortality types, life stage was not a significant predictor of AR exposure (P=0.725), but males were more likely to have been exposed to ARs (P=0.032). These findings suggest that there is no difference in the influence of anticoagulant exposure on higher and lower altitude activity in Golden Eagles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAquila chrysaetos 3aaltitude 3aanticoagulants 3abrodifacoum 3abromadiolone 3adeath 3aenergy 3afish 3aforensic sciences 3aliver 3amortality 3apower lines 3aregression analysis 3atoxicity 3awildlife 3awind 3awind turbines 0aelectrocution 0aforensics 0aGolden Eagle 0awind turbine1 aKagan, Rebecca A.1 aLehner, Andreas1 aBuchweitz, John P.0 tJournal of wildlife diseases.g2022 Apr. 21, v. 58, no. 2 p.348-355dWildlife Disease AssociationwJournal:1978x0090-35587nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.7589/JWD-D-21-001443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01142naa a2200253 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100003100142245008900173300001600262500001400278520032700292592002800619650001600647650001500663650001700678773012700695856004500822852000900867655001200876IND4467119920221121025907.0120609e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446711992DNAL7 a10.1002/ejlt.2012001022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiménez‐Escrig, Antonio10aAnalysis of dietary phytochemicals needs to be applauded: Glycosylated plant sterols  ap. 615-616.  aEDITORIAL  aIn this issue of European Journal of Lipid Science and Technology, Lampi and co‐workers [p. 656–669] report the content of glycosylated plant sterols (steryl glycosides and acylated steryl glycosides) as minor glycolipids found in common edible plants.

They also affect powder properties such as physical and storage stability. Quantification of amorphous components of food powders may be challenging. We developed a dynamic water sorption by dynamic dew point isotherm (DDI) method, which records the change of water activity and weight change (or water content) of a sample continuously. The research was aimed to study the amorphous content of vacuum-dried honey powder produced from different drying temperatures. The DDI method was calibrated using known amorphous contents of amorphous sucrose and mixtures of amorphous sucrose and maltodextrin. Amorphous materials often exhibit higher sorption of water than crystalline materials. In the new approach, water sorption data were differentiated numerically and plotted against water activity. The water sorbed by the sample during recrystallization was measured by integrating the area of the new derived water sorption curve against water activity. The water sorbed was correlated with the amorphous content of the system. The honey powder also exhibited recrystallization of its amorphous sugar during water sorption. The result showed that the higher the drying temperature, the higher the amorphous content of vacuum-dried honey powder.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrystallization 3adewpoint 3adrying 3adrying temperature 3ahoney 3amaltodextrins 3apowders 3asorption 3astorage quality 3asucrose 3awater activity 3awater content 0aAmorphous 0aDynamic water sorption 0aSucrose 0aMaltodextrin 0aHoney powder1 aRoos, Y.H.0 tPowder technology.g2016 Nov., v. 301 p.981-988dElsevier B.V.x0032-59107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2016.07.0553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01739naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005700148245008400205300001600289520075100305592002801056650002301084650001301107650002001120650001201140650002001152650001801172650002301190650000901213773011101222856008301333852000901416655001201425IND60625299620221120105202.0190624e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062529962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cofs.2018.10.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWilson, D Ian1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3950-916510aFouling during food processing – progress in tackling this inconvenient truth  ap. 105-112.  aProgress in understanding fouling in food processing operations is assessed, -based on a review of the literature published from 2014–2017.

The awareness of fouling being one stage in a fouling-cleaning cycle is becoming more widespread and this is being incorporated in the selection of mitigation strategies and development of coatings or new surfaces.

Firstly, an extended morphological multi-attributes profiles algorithm is used to extract spatial information of HSI, and a spatial–spectral multi-features fusion model is established to improve classification results. Then, BPMRF is used for image segmentation and classification because of its superiority in the spatial–spectral combination classification. MRF can describe the spatial distribution features of ground objects based on neighborhood model, and the spectral information of pixels can be integrated into the calculation of conditional probability. BP is used to learn the marginal probability distributions from the multi-features fusion information. Finally, the small sample training set is selected to enhance the computational efficiency. In the experiments of several hyperspectral images, the proposed method provides higher classification accuracy than other methods, and it is efficient for the classification with limited labeled training samples.  aPublisher supplied data  a61461003cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aalgorithms 3ahyperspectral imagery 3alearning 3aprobabilistic models 3aprobability 3aprobability distribution 3aremote sensing 3aspatial data1 aBao, Wenxing1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1636-17970 tJournal of the Indian Society of Remote Sensing.g2019 Feb., v. 47, no. 2 p.307-316dSpringer IndiawJournal:J000001231x0255-660X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12524-018-00934-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02107naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001900143245009800162500001400260520107100274592002801345650001801373650002401391650001201415650002201427650001401449650002101463650001701484700001701501700001801518700002101536773012601557856007701683852000901760655001201769IND60718852620221121072755.0201126e20201102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071885262DNAL7 a10.3390/antiox91110762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPak, Jhang  Ho10aAntioxidant Therapy against Oxidative Damage of the Inner Ear: Protection and Preconditioning  aNAL-light  aOxidative stress is an important mechanism underlying cellular damage of the inner ear, resulting in hearing loss. In order to prevent hearing loss, several types of antioxidants have been investigated; several experiments have shown their ability to effectively prevent noise-induced hearing loss, age-related hearing loss, and ototoxicity in animal models. Exogenous antioxidants has been used as single therapeutic agents or in combination. Antioxidant therapy is generally administered before the production of reactive oxygen species. However, post-exposure treatment could also be effective. Preconditioning refers to the phenomenon of pre-inducing a preventative pathway by subtle stimuli that do not cause permanent damage in the inner ear. This renders the inner ear more resistant to actual stimuli that cause permanent hearing damage. The preconditioning mechanism is also related to the induction of antioxidant enzymes. In this review, we discuss the mechanisms underlying antioxidant-associated therapeutic effects and preconditioning in the inner ear.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal models 3aantioxidant enzymes 3ahearing 3ahearing disorders 3ainner ear 3aoxidative stress 3atherapeutics1 aKim, Yehree 1 aYi, Junyeong 1 aChung, Jong  Woo0 tAntioxidants.g2020 Nov. 02, v. 9, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27130x2076-39217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/antiox91110763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03207naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005600151245008400207300001600291520179700307592002802104650002002132650001102152650001502163650001202178650001602190650001002206650001202216650002102228650001202249653002002261653002102281653002702302653002202329700005602351700005602407700005702463700001902520773015102539856008602690852000902776655001202785IND60532275220221120223617.0190214e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053227522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anbehav.2014.11.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCurren, L.J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5840-383614aThe functions of male–male aggression in a female-dominated mammalian society  ap. 208-216.  aIn most mammals, male–male contests over access to resources select for males to be larger, more aggressive and better armed than females. However, the functional significance of male–male aggression has been little studied in sex-role-reversed species, such as spotted hyaenas, Crocuta crocuta. This species has highly aggressive, socially dominant females, to which male access cannot be directly improved by fighting. Here, we first demonstrated that males nevertheless display intrasexual aggression at rates similar to rates of intrasexual aggression displayed by adult females. We then tested three hypotheses suggesting functions of this aggression among males. Males aggressed significantly less in the presence of an adult female than when adult females were absent, suggesting that they do not use aggression to prevent other males from remaining in close proximity to females. New immigrants received significantly more aggression from other immigrants than did established immigrants, but new and established immigrants were treated equally by adult natal males. These results supported a hypothesis suggesting that male–male aggression functions to restrict clan membership, although the data indicated that immigrants, not adult natal males, engage in aggression for this reason. Finally, a hypothesis suggesting that this behaviour functions to provide access to food was supported by data showing that male–male aggression occurred significantly more frequently, and at higher intensities, in the presence than the absence of food. In contrast to male–male contests in most mammals, those in spotted hyaenas appear to increase a male's access to females only indirectly, which is presumably due to the sex-role-reversed nature of social dominance in spotted hyaenas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCrocuta crocuta 3aadults 3aaggression 3afemales 3aimmigration 3amales 3amammals 3asocial dominance 3asociety 0aCrocuta crocuta 0afemale dominance 0amale–male aggression 0asex-role reversal1 aLinden, D.W.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7117-189X1 aHeinen, V.K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1804-35891 aMcGuire, M.C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2754-330X1 aHolekamp, K.E.0 tAnimal behaviour.g2015 Feb., v. 100 p.208-216dElsevier LtdaThe Association for the Study of Animal BehaviourwJournal:jnl45841x0003-34727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2014.11.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02971naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245012300160300001600283520171000299592002802009650002302037650002702060650002402087650002302111650001902134650002902153650001502182650002302197650001602220650001602236650001302252650001402265650001402279650002202293650001302315700002002328700001202348773009902360856008102459852000902540655001202549IND60082882920221121231402.0141101e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008288292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fsi.2011.06.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Yun12aA multivalent killed whole-cell vaccine induces effective protection against Edwardsiella tarda and Vibrio anguillarum  ap. 595-599.  aEdwardsiella tarda, Vibrio anguillarum, Streptococcus iniae, and Vibrio harveyi are important aquaculture pathogens that affect a wide range of fish species. In this study, we examined in a Japanese founder (Paralichthys olivaceus) model the possibility of developing simple, killed whole-cell vaccines with protective effect against two or more of the above pathogens. For this purpose, we utilized four pathogenic fish isolates: E. tarda TX1, V. anguillarum C312, S. iniae SF1, and V. harveyi T4D. Flounder were immunized with inactivated monovalent TX1, C312, SF1, or T4D, or with different combinations of these strains in the form of (i): TX1, C312, SF1, and T4D mix (M4); (ii) TX1, C312, and SF1 mix (M3); (iii) TX1 and C312 mix (M2). Fish were challenged at two months post-vaccination with E. tarda, V. anguillarum, S. iniae, or V. harveyi and monitored for mortality. The results showed that the monovalent vaccines produced low protections, with relative percent survival (RPS) rates between 33.3% and 53.9%. Compared to monovalent vaccines, M2, M3, and M4 all induced significantly higher levels of protection against E. tarda. In addition, M2 and M4 also effected much higher (∼19%) RPS rates against V. anguillarum. Serum antibody production and bactericidal activity analysis showed a correlation between protection efficacy and antibody level. These results suggest a humoral immunity-based mechanism of protection induced by inactivated whole-cell vaccines, and that there exists a mutual and specific immunostimulatory effect between E. tarda TX1 and V. anguillarum C312, which enables the divalent M2 to induce effective protective immunity against E. tarda and V. anguillarum.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEdwardsiella tarda 3aParalichthys olivaceus 3aStreptococcus iniae 3aVibrio anguillarum 3aVibrio harveyi 3aantibacterial properties 3aantibodies 3aantibody formation 3aaquaculture 3ablood serum 3aflounder 3amortality 3apathogens 3aprotective effect 3avaccines1 aLiu, Chun-sheng1 aSun, Li0 tFish & shellfish immunology.g2011 Oct., v. 31, no. 4 p.595-599dElsevier Ltdx1050-46487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2011.06.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02910naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002300152245010800175300001800283520142400301592002801725650001101753650001401764650001601778650001801794650001401812650001301826650001901839650001901858650000901877650002701886650001001913650001401923650000701937650000901944650001701953650001601970653001301986653002801999653003502027653002802062700002302090700001502113700002102128700002202149773013702171856008702308852000902395655001202404IND60739167020221121064255.0210729e20210731xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073916702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2021.05.1252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGanie, Showkat Ali10aPreparation, characterization, release and antianemic studies of guar gum functionalized Iron complexes  ap. 1495-1504.  aGuar gum is a neutral, non-ionic polysaccharide that has been extensively utilized in the food industry as a stabilizer, excipients, and emulsifier agent. An oxidized derivative of this edible guar gum was prepared and used as a complexing agent for iron to obtain a polysaccharide-bound iron (II) complex. The degree of oxidation varies between 30.12 and 60.63% with a corresponding aldehyde content (0.59–1.79 mmol/g) and carboxyl contents (0.49–1.62 mmol/g), which were determined by the titrimetry method. Sophisticated spectroscopic techniques characterized all the products. The natural polymer-based hydrophilic and hydrophobic formulations as coating were used for achieving the sustained or prolonged release from the complex tablets. Release studies of the tablets were carried out in different mediums of varying pH. The total iron available from the tablets was compared with that obtained from ferrous fumarate prepared under similar conditions, and the results were found to be comparable. Release results demonstrate the pH-sensitive behaviour of the guar gum-based delivery system towards the controlled release of iron. Antianemic effect of new functionalized guar gum iron complexes was investigated on male albino rats. The complexes may exhibit the potential to recover the hematological index of the albino rats with some positive effects on improving rat's growth with iron deficiency anaemia.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalbino 3aaldehydes 3aemulsifiers 3afood industry 3afumarates 3aguar gum 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3airon 3airon deficiency anemia 3amales 3aoxidation 3apH 3arats 3aspectroscopy 3astabilizers 0aGuar gum 0aFunctionalized guar gum 0aMetal-polysaccharide complexes 0aIron deficiency anaemia1 aNaik, Rayees Ahmad1 aAli, Akbar1 aMir, Tariq Ahmad1 aMazumdar, Nasreen0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2021 July 31, v. 183 p.1495-1504dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2021.05.1253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02946naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100002000161245009300181300001400274500000900288520160400297592002801901650001601929650001301945650000901958650001501967650001301982650002101995650002702016650001502043650002102058650002202079650001802101650001502119650002502134650002102159650001702180650001602197700001802213700001802231773014602249856009602395852000902491655001202500IND60667941420221120114329.0191125e198701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066794142DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1987.03615995005100010004x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnderson, S. H.10aInfluence of Spatially Variable Soil Hydraulic Properties on Predictions of Water Stress  ap. 17-22.  aepub  aModels are often used to predict drainage system effects on crop production. Variability of soil hydraulic properties on predictions made by many models have not been evaluated. This study evaluated several methods for predicting water transport properties and corn (Zea mays L.) stress as influenced by variable soil hydraulic properties in a field of Portsmouth sandy loam (Typic Umbraquults). Upflux, drainage volume, and infiltration parameters as functions of water table depth were predicted using hydraulic conductivity and soil water retention functions for three soil horizons measured at 150 locations in a field. Crop stress due to both deficient and excess soil water conditions and relative crop yield were estimated using DRAINMOD, a water management simulation model, for three selected methods of averaging soil property inputs. Small differences existed among the three approaches for the 30-yr average relative corn yield. Large differences in relative corn yield occurred in dry years indicating that the variability of the soil properties was important to consider in predicting crop stress during relatively dry years. More information for the field soil-drainage response was obtained using the individual locations method which allowed soil property inputs to vary from location to location at each of the 150 points in the field. However, the field averages approach is more practical because fewer data are required to perform the necessary computations and only a 3% difference in the 30-yr relative yield resulted between the individual location and field average methods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUmbraquults 3aZea mays 3acorn 3acrop yield 3adrainage 3adrainage systems 3ahydraulic conductivity 3aprediction 3asandy loam soils 3asimulation models 3asoil horizons 3asoil water 3asoil water retention 3awater management 3awater stress 3awater table1 aCassel, D.

As of 2014 more than a fifth of Sub-Saharan Africa’s population remain food insecure according to the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO). The food security challenges in Sub-Saharan Africa are linked to economic, agro-ecological, technological/agronomic, institutional and related factors. These causes however overlay complex interactions and constraints within the key physical resources of Water Land and Energy (WLE), which are necessary for food production, processing, distribution and consumption. The relationship between the WLE interactions and the performance of SSA’s food systems, and the impacts of interventions at different scales are not yet fully understood, particularly in light of the need to maintain essential ecosystem services.This study employs an integrated multi-scale Food System resource analysis approach to examine Uganda’s WLE resource constraints vis-à-vis 2012 and 2050 agricultural resource demand at national, district and local scales, as a test case for Sub-Saharan Africa. The analysis identifies where the competing WLE resource constraints are and the variations from local (sub-county), regional, to national scale so that potential policy interventions can be appropriately targeted. The approach involves a combination of geo-spatial analysis, calorific-demand analysis and Source-to-Service resource transformation modelling. The results are visualised using coupled Sankey diagrams and resource stress maps. The analysis reveals the current competing demands and constraints at different scales, and helps to identify key resource intervention areas to resolve resource stress in Uganda’s food system. The inferences highlight variations in the significance of resource stress at different analytical resolutions and constraints at different locations for the WLE resources. Overall, the analysis helps to inform food security policy and the resource context for the present and future management of Uganda’s food system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFood and Agriculture Organization 3aecosystems 3aenergy 3afood production 3afood security 3aissues and policy 3amodels 3aplague 3aUganda 0aFood security 0aResource demand analysis 0aSub-Saharan Africa 0aWater–Land–Energy nexus 0aMulti-scale modelling 0aResource sustainability1 aFenner, Richard A.0 tSustainable Production and Consumption.g2015 Apr., v. 2 p.79-95dElsevier B.V.aThe Institution of Chemical EngineerswJournal:23261x2352-55097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.spc.2015.07.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02875naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245014200167300001400309520105900323592002801382650001501410650001501425650002401440650001201464650001101476650001701487650001101504650002301515650001401538650001701552653003401569653005501603653004101658653003901699653005701738653002901795653003501824653001501859653001701874653001201891653001301903653001801916653002301934700001501957700001601972700001601988700001202004700001902016700001802035700001402053700001702067773010602084856008602190852000902276655001202285IND60556916820221121081133.0190318e20170102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055691682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2016.08.0382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Anwei10aCarbon disulfide-modified magnetic ion-imprinted chitosan-Fe(III): A novel adsorbent for simultaneous removal of tetracycline and cadmium  ap. 19-27.  aA novel composite of carbon disulfide-modified magnetic ion-imprinted chitosan-Fe(III), i.e., MMIC-Fe(III) composite, was prepared as an efficient adsorbent for the simultaneous removal of tetracycline (TC) and Cd(II). This adsorbent showed excellent performance in removing TC and Cd(II) due to its rapid kinetics, high adsorption capacity, good reusability, and was well suited for use with real water samples. Kinetics studies demonstrated that the adsorption proceeded according to a pseudo-second order model. The adsorption isotherms were well described by the Langmuir model, with maximum adsorption capacity for TC and Cd(II) being 516.29 and 194.31mg/g, respectively. The synergistic effect of TC and Cd(II) adsorption might be due to the formation of TC-Cd(II) complex bridging the adsorbate and adsorbent. These properties demonstrate the potential application of MMIC-Fe(III) for the simultaneous removal of TC and Cd(II), and may provide some information for the synergistic removal of antibiotics and heavy metals from aquatic environments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aaquatic environment 3acadmium 3acarbon 3aheavy metals 3amodels 3asorption isotherms 3asynergism 3atetracycline 0aChitosan (PubChem CID: 71853) 0aTetracycline hydrochloride (PubChem CID: 54704426) 0aCarbon disulfide (PubChem CID: 6348) 0aGlutaraldehyde (PubChem CID: 3485) 0aCadmium nitrate tetrahydrate (PubChem CID: 56924536) 0aEDTA (PubChem CID: 6049) 0aAcetic acid (PubChem CID: 176) 0aAdsorption 0aTetracycline 0aCadmium 0aChitosan 0aIon-imprinted 0aCombined pollution1 aShang, Cui1 aShao, Jihai1 aLin, Yiqing1 aLuo, Si1 aZhang, Jiachao1 aHuang, Hongli1 aLei, Ming1 aZeng, Qingru0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2017 Jan. 02, v. 155 p.19-27dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2016.08.0383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03343naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001700143245013400160500001400294520173700308592002802045650000802073650001302081650002802094650001002122650001002132650001402142650002002156650001602176650000902192650001902201650002802220650001902248650001102267650000902278650001702287650001402304650001202318650002802330650002502358650002402383650001302407650001002420650001002430650001902440700002502459700002102484700002002505700001902525700002102544773012602565856007702691852000902768655001202777IND60718852820221123011050.0201126e20201023xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071885282DNAL7 a10.3390/antiox91110332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKerns, Karl 10aRelationship between the Length of Sperm Tail Mitochondrial Sheath and Fertility Traits in Boars Used for Artificial Insemination  aNAL-light  aThe length of sperm tail midpiece, occupied by the mitochondrial sheath (MS), has been correlated with reproductive traits of mice, fish, and birds; however, it is not known whether such a correlation exists in higher order species such as domestic pigs. As the mitochondria provide for sperm motility and generate the fertility-affecting reactive oxygen species (ROS), we hypothesized that MS length correlates with boar semen parameters and artificial insemination (AI) fertility. Sperm samples collected from 57 boars and used for single sire AI were labeled with ProteoStat Aggresome probe (AGG; Enzo Life Sciences) for MS imaging by epifluorescence microscopy and image-based flow cytometry (IBFC). The mean boar MS length was 7.26 ± 0.2 µm, ranging from 6.94 ± 0.18 µm to 7.65 ± 0.31 µm. The absolute longest MS measured was 9.19 µm and the shortest was 5.83 µm. Boars in the high tertile of MS length had significantly higher conception rate (CR; p = 0.05) and sperm parameters. Boars within the high tertile of average number piglets born per litter had significantly shorter MS and more varied MS length than boars in the low tertile (p = 0.04). MS length data correlated with conventional sperm parameters including percent viable and intact acrosomes (p = 0.03), basal:induced oxidation ratio (measure of intracellular ROS levels; p = 0.02) and Comp DNA (chromatin integrity; p = 0.06) along with many flow cytometric AGG parameters in IBFC. Sperm head AGG intensity median absolute deviation had a negative correlation with total born (r = -0.423 p = 0.004). These data reveal a complex relationship between sperm MS length and aggresome abundance to sperm parameters and boar reproductive success in AI service.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aacrosome 3aartificial insemination 3abirds 3aboars 3achromatin 3aconception rate 3acorrelation 3afish 3aflow cytometry 3afluorescence microscopy 3aimage analysis 3alength 3amice 3amitochondria 3aoxidation 3apiglets 3areactive oxygen species 3areproductive success 3areproductive traits 3asampling 3asemen 3asires 3asperm motility1 aJankovitz, Jennifer 1 aRobinson, Julie 1 aMinton, Amanda 1 aKuster, Chris 1 aSutovsky, Peter 0 tAntioxidants.g2020 Oct. 23, v. 9, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27130x2076-39217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/antiox91110333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03213naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001800153245012900171520150500300592002801805650001301833650001301846650001701859650003001876650001201906650001701918650001801935650001201953650002201965650001301987650001302000650001402013650002302027650001802050650001602068650002002084651001402104653002002118653002802138653001902166653002402185653002202209653003502231700001702266700003002283700001802313700002202331700001802353700001502371700001902386700001402405773011902419856008802538852000902626655001202635IND60753708020221118090301.0211227e20220201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075370802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1508972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Wenping10aPopulation and molecular responses to warming in Netzelia tuberspinifera – An endemic and sensitive protist from East Asia  aWith the effects of global warming becoming ever more obvious, biodiversity conservation is facing severe challenges. Currently, a deeper understanding the mechanisms of the effects of warming on sensitive species has become an important topic in aquatic biodiversity and ecological management. Our study first overcame the “challenge” for a sensitive indicator species (Netzelia tuberspinifera, an endemic testate amoeba species in East Asia) of culturing under laboratory conditions, and then explored its molecular response mechanisms to warming using transcriptomic analysis. Our data indicate that temperature mainly drove the geographical and seasonal variation of N. tuberspinifera populations. Transcriptomic results indicate that when the temperature is <25 °C, rising temperature triggers the biosynthesis of ribosomes; while the temperature is >25 °C, it triggers molecular processes related with cell division, test formation and general biomass increase. However, once the temperature exceeds 40 °C, N. tuberspinifera is unable to survive. Following from these results, the distribution of N. tuberspinifera might expand towards higher altitude or latitude regions under global warming. For the first time, our study showed direct evidence for sensitive protozoa species that presents a very narrow adaptation mechanism to local climate. Our work provides fundamental data for regional biodiversity conservation and scientific reference in subtropical and tropical waterbodies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aProtozoa 3aaltitude 3abiodiversity 3abiodiversity conservation 3abiomass 3abiosynthesis 3acell division 3aclimate 3aindicator species 3alatitude 3aprotists 3aribosomes 3aseasonal variation 3asurface water 3atemperature 3atranscriptomics 3aEast Asia 0aTestate amoebae 0aSubtropical waterbodies 0aTranscriptomic 0aMolecular mechanism 0aMetabolic pathway 0aDifferentially expressed genes1 aGao, Xiaofei1 aNdayishimiye, Jean Claude1 aLara, Enrique1 aLahr, Daniel J.G.1 aQian, Haifeng1 aRen, Kexin1 aChen, Huihuang1 aYang, Jun0 tScience of the total environment.g2022 Feb. 01, v. 806 p.150897-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1508973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02912naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245009200172300001800264500000900282520158200291592002801873650001701901650002101918650002801939650002101967650002501988650000902013650001002022650002002032650001502052650001802067650001802085650002002103650002502123651001302148700002602161700002102187700001902208773016002227856008202387852000902469655001202478IND60667941620221120114354.0191125e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066794162DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj2013.02.00762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee Roberts, Trenton10aAssimilation of 15N Labeled Fertilizer Injected at Various Depths by Delayed-flood Rice  ap. 2039-2044.  aepub  aThe recently developed Nitrogen-Soil Test for Rice or N-STaR requires a 0- to 45-cm soil sample to accurately predict the N fertilizer requirements of rice (Oryza sativa L.) produced on silt loam soils. Following its release questions were raised concerning the ability of rice to assimilate N from soil depths >30 cm. Therefore, a study was established using ¹⁵N-labeled (NH₄)₂SO₄ to determine if rice roots were penetrating and actively using N from depths >30 cm. During 2009 and 2010, research trials were conducted on six silt loam soils across the primary rice producing regions of Arkansas to determine if rice roots were assimilating N at soil depths up to 60 cm. A modified fertilizer injection system was developed to inject ¹⁵N-labeled (NH₄)₂SO₄ at depths of 30, 45, and 60 cm, below the rice crop in an undisturbed soil profile. Statistical analysis indicated that fertilizer placement depth was the only factor significantly influencing the fertilizer nitrogen uptake efficiency (FNUE) (p < 0.0001). As fertilizer placement depth increased, there was a decrease in N recovery with FNUE values of 93, 40, and 9% for the 30-, 45-, and 60-cm depths, respectively. These findings indicate that roots of rice produced on silt loam soils are able to penetrate and use N at depths of 30 to 60 cm. Previous research that indicates a significant amount of potentially mineralizable N at depths up to 60 cm coupled with the data presented here identify the need for modified soil sampling depths during the development of soil-based N tests such as N-STaR.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOryza sativa 3aammonium sulfate 3afertilizer requirements 3aisotope labeling 3anitrogen fertilizers 3arice 3aroots 3asilt loam soils 3asoil depth 3asoil profiles 3asoil sampling 3astable isotopes 3astatistical analysis 3aArkansas1 aNormon, Richard James1 aFulford, Anthony1 aSlaton, Nathan0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g2013 Nov., v. 77, no. 6 p.2039-2044dThe Soil Science Society of America, Inc.wJournal:jnl44580x0361-59957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj2013.02.00763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02640naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245011900170300001300289520111200302592002801414650002401442650002201466650002701488650001701515650001801532650002001550650001801570650001201588650000901600650001101609650001401620650002001634650002201654650001301676653002501689653002501714653002201739653002001761653002201781700001901803700002101822700001601843700001701859700005801876773010501934856008602039852000902125655001202134IND60556916920221121062250.0190318e20170102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055691692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2016.08.0402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShin, Woo Jung10aHyaluronic acid-supported combination of water insoluble immunostimulatory compounds for anti-cancer immunotherapy  ap. 1-10.  aA novel powder-form combination adjuvant system containing two immunostimulatory compounds was firstly developed and evaluated as a therapeutic intervention for cancer immunotherapy. With the help of hyaluronic acid (HA), water insoluble monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL), QS21 and imiquimod (R837), could be easily dispersed in aqueous solution and lyophilized as powder-form, which have an advantage in room-temperature storage stability compared with those conventional liquid formulation that requires cold storage. Two kinds of HA-based combination vaccine adjuvants (HA/MPL/QS21, HMQ and HA/MPL/R837, HMR) contributed to the increase of both humoral and cellular immunity, which is very important for efficient cancer immunotherapy. Through the challenge experiments in EG7-OVA (mouse lymphoma-expressing OVA) tumor-bearing mice model, we found out that the immunostimulatory effects of HMQ and HMR were successful in the inhibition of tumor proliferation. Taken together, both HA-based powder-form combination adjuvant systems are expected to be used as potent prophylactic and therapeutic cancer vaccine.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3aaqueous solutions 3acell-mediated immunity 3acold storage 3afreeze drying 3ahyaluronic acid 3aimmunotherapy 3alipid A 3amice 3amodels 3aneoplasms 3astorage quality 3avaccine adjuvants 3avaccines 0aCancer immunotherapy 0aPowder-form adjuvant 0aImmunostimulation 0aHyaluronic acid 0aCellular immunity1 aNoh, Hyun Jong1 aNoh, Young-Woock1 aKim, Sohyun1 aUm, Soong Ho1 aLim, Yong Taik1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5558-55260 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2017 Jan. 02, v. 155 p.1-10dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2016.08.0403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02331naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100002000137245011900157300001800276520098100294650002101275650001801296650002301314650001201337650001601349650001101365650001501376650001101391650001101402650001401413650001601427650001301443650002901456650001301485700002101498700002701519700002001546700002201566700002201588700002901610700002301639773016201662856004001824852000901864655001201873IND4534977220221119085101.0150915s2014    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND453497722DNAL7 a10.1021/jf50016982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aServillo, Luigi10aN-Methylated Derivatives of Tyramine in Citrus Genus Plants: Identification of N,N,N-Trimethyltyramine (Candicine)  ap. 2679-2684.  aThe distribution of tyramine and its methylated derivatives, N-methyltyramine and N,N-dimethyltyramine, was investigated in tissue parts (leaves and fruits) of several plants of Citrus genus by liquid chromatographyâelectrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS). In the course of our study we discovered the occurrence of N,N,N-trimethyltyramine in all citrus plants examined. This quaternary ammonium compound, known to act in animals as a neurotoxin, was recognized and characterized by mass spectrometric analysis. The substance, never described before in the Citrus genus, is also known as candicine or maltoxin. Results indicate that N,N,N-trimethyltyramine is consistently expressed in leaves of clementine, bitter orange, and lemon. Conversely, low levels were found in the leaves of orange, mandarin, chinotto (Citrus myrtifolia), bergamot, citron, and pomelo. In the edible part of the fruits, N,N,N-trimethyltyramine was found at trace levels. 3aCitrus aurantium 3aCitrus medica 3aammonium compounds 3aanimals 3aclementines 3afruits 3aionization 3aleaves 3alemons 3amandarins 3aneurotoxins 3apummelos 3atandem mass spectrometry 3atyramine1 aGiovane, Alfonso1 aDâOnofrio, Nunzia1 aCasale, Rosario1 aCautela, Domenico1 aFerrari, Giovanna1 aBalestrieri, Maria Luisa1 aCastaldo, Domenico0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2014 Mar. 26, v. 62, no. 12 p.2679-2684dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Divisionx0021-85617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf5001698  aDNAL 7aarticle02706naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001700166245019000183300001800373520131200391592002801703650001201731650002101743650001901764650001401783650001101797650000901808650001601817650001501833650001201848650001101860650001101871650001201882650002401894650005901918650001101977650002901988650000902017651001302026700002002039773009902059856008102158852000902239655001202248IND50073923520221119045301.0150213e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007392352DNAL7 a245357342pmid7 a10.1007/s00436-014-3803-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMacko, J.

(Trematoda: Echinostomatidae), is described and illustrated based on specimens collected from the intestine of the white stork Ciconia ciconia (L.) (Aves: Ciconiidae) from eastern Slovakia and dissected soon after its spring arrival from African wintering. The new species differs from the two existing congeners Echinodollfusia stenon (Dollfus, 1950) and Echinodollfusia bulgarica Vassilev (Sofia 6:327–338, 1958) clearly by the oesophagus bearing diverticula, the bipartite seminal vesicle and gonads situated entirely in anterior body half. The new species E. longiuscula n. sp. can also be distinguished by possessing the following combination of features: a slender body of 12.85–21.06-mm long and maximum of 581–855-μm wide; head collar with 43–47 small collar spines, dorsal in double row; oral sucker more than half the size as ventral sucker, small pharynx, oval and in tandem testes situated pre-equatorial, small ovary at the boundary of anterior third of the body and anteriormost extent of the vitelline fields just reaching the level of posterior margin of the ventral sucker. An amended generic diagnosis of little-known Echinodollfusia Skrjabin et Bashkirova (Osnovy Trematodologii 12:51–930, 1956) is also given here.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCiconia 3aEchinostomatidae 3aanimal ovaries 3aesophagus 3aflukes 3ahead 3anew species 3aparasitism 3apharynx 3aspring 3atestes 2aAnimals 2aBirdsxparasitology 2aEchinostomatidaexanatomy & histologyxclassification. 2aFemale 2aIntestinesxparasitology 2aMale 0aSlovakia1 aŠpakulová, M.0 tParasitology research.g2014 Apr., v. 113, no. 4 p.1581-1584dSpringer-Verlagx0932-01137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-014-3803-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02745naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245010000167520144300267592002801710650001401738650002301752650001101775650000901786650002201795650001101817650001501828650001801843650002401861650002301885651001601908653002501924653001601949653003501965653002202000653002002022700001402042700001602056700001602072700001702088773009802105856008702203852000902290655001202299IND60697018620221119043149.0200819e20200815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069701862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.1151772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPagani, M.10aDistrict heat network extension to decarbonise building stock: A bottom-up agent-based approach  aA novel framework, that is comprised of large-scale, agent-based models of residential buildings and the occupants of the buildings, and a bottom-up heat demand model, is developed to assess scenarios related to the extension of a city’s district heat network. The agent-based models account for the characteristics of the individual buildings and the behaviours of the individual occupants. The bottom-up heat demand model accounts for the spatial and temporal differences in heat demand of individual buildings. It is shown that by accounting for the behaviour of building occupants the time-resolved dynamics of heat demand are more accurately captured and the quantitative prediction of the heat demand is improved compared to prior approaches. The novel framework is applied to assess the extension of the district heat network of a mid-sized city in Switzerland, whereby the likelihood of a building to connecting to the extended network can be considered. By accounting both for the profitability of the predicted heat demand and for the likelihood of a building being connected to the extended network, the internal rate of return of the infrastructure can be increased by 25%, compared to an extension of the network where these aspects are not considered. Overall, this novel framework provides insights and cost-effective solutions for policy makers and energy multi-utilities regarding the decarbonisation of building stock.  aPublisher supplied data 3abuildings 3acost effectiveness 3aenergy 3aheat 3aissues and policy 3amodels 3aprediction 3aprofitability 3aresidential housing 3atemporal variation 3aSwitzerland 0aBottom-up heat model 0aAgent-based 0aPredictive logistic regression 0aRouting algorithm 0aDecarbonisation1 aMaire, P.1 aKorosec, W.1 aChokani, N.1 aAbhari, R.S.0 tApplied energy.g2020 Aug. 15, v. 272 p.115177-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.1151773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02444naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001700141245010800158520148500266592002801751650001801779650001201797650001701809650001201826650001801838700001901856700001701875700002001892700001301912773012001925856007602045852000902121655001202130IND60768231420221119152039.0220225e20220215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076823142DNAL7 a10.3390/ani120404752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNiu, Xiaoke 10aSurround Modulation Properties of Tectal Neurons in Pigeons Characterized by Moving and Flashed Stimuli  aSurround modulation has been abundantly studied in several mammalian brain areas, including the primary visual cortex, lateral geniculate nucleus, and superior colliculus (SC), but systematic analysis is lacking in the avian optic tectum (OT, homologous to mammal SC). Here, multi-units were recorded from pigeon (Columba livia) OT, and responses to different sizes of moving, flashed squares, and bars were compared. The statistical results showed that most tectal neurons presented suppressed responses to larger stimuli in both moving and flashed paradigms, and suppression induced by flashed squares was comparable with moving ones when the stimuli center crossed the near classical receptive field (CRF) center, which corresponded to the full surrounding condition. Correspondingly, the suppression grew weaker when the stimuli center moved across the CRF border, equivalent to partially surrounding conditions. Similarly, suppression induced by full surrounding flashed squares was more intense than by partially surrounding flashed bars. These results suggest that inhibitions performed on tectal neurons appear to be full surrounding rather than locally lateral. This study enriches the understanding of surround modulation properties of avian tectum neurons and provides possible hypotheses about the arrangement of inhibitions from other nuclei, both of which are important for clarifying the mechanism of target detection against clutter background performed by avians.  aPublisher supplied data 3aColumba livia 3amammals 3aoptic tectum 3apigeons 3avisual cortex1 aHuang, Shuman 1 aZhu, Minjie 1 aWang, Zhizhong 1 aShi, Li 0 tAnimals.g2022 Feb. 15, v. 12, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani120404753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02535naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132100001100150245009900161300001600260520124100276592002801517650002501545650001801570650001101588650001601599650000901615650001501624650001701639650001701656650001001673650001801683650001501701650001501716650001401731650001101745650001601756700001501772700001401787700001301801700001301814700001401827773014101841856008601982852000902068655001202077IND4533487320221119164811.0200511e20150101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND453348732DNAL7 a10.1080/14620316.2015.115131972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, D.10aEffect of light from cold cathode fluorescent lamps on tree peony (Paeonia suffruticosa) calli  ap. 375-378.  aLight quality has significant effects on the growth of Paeonia suffruticosa calli in vitro. In this study, callus growth was examined under six different combinations of light of different wavelengths using cold cathode fluorescent lamps (CCFLs): 100% white (W; 410 - 730 nm); 100% red (R; 622 - 625 nm); 100% blue (B; 467 - 470 nm); 80% R plus 20% B; 70% R plus 30% B; or 60% R plus 40% B. Calli grown under regular fluorescent lamps served as the controls. Calli cultured under red light at 622 - 625 nm had the highest average fresh weight (FW; 1.2206 g per callus) and average increase in callus FW (1.1519-fold per callus), compared to calli grown under the other six light conditions. Chlorophyll concentrations per callus were highest in calli cultured under 60% R plus 40% B light. Callus physiology and biochemistry, including total soluble sugar concentrations and peroxidase activity, were higher under 100% R light than under the other six light conditions. Total soluble protein and phenolic compound concentrations were higher under 100% B light than under the other six light conditions.This study indicates that CCFLs are a more effective light source than regular fluorescent lamps for callus growth in P. suffruticosa.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPaeonia suffruticosa 3abiotechnology 3acallus 3achlorophyll 3acold 3aelectrodes 3afluorescence 3ahorticulture 3alamps 3alight quality 3aperoxidase 3aphysiology 3ared light 3asugars 3awavelengths1 aLiu, Y.

Recent reports using massive parallel sequencing technologies have discovered additional cancer driver genes. PBRM1 was found to be mutated in about 40% of ccRCC tumors, whereas BAP1 and SETD2 were each mutated in about 10–15% of ccRCC tumors. JARID1C and UTX, two histone H3 demethylases, were also found to harbor mutations in ccRCC, albeit at lower rates. ccRCC tumors display a high degree of intra-tumoral heterogeneity, with some mutations present in all cancer cells (ubiquitous), whereas others are subclonal. The VHL mutations were always ubiquitous in the tumors; PBRM1 mutations were also ubiquitous but to a lesser extent. On the contrary, mutations in BAP1, SETD2, JARID1C, and UTX were all subclonal, meaning that they were present in a subset of cancer cells in a tumor. The prognostic value of PBRM1 mutations in ccRCC is still controversial, whereas BAP1 mutations were tightly linked to worse clinical outcomes in multiple studies. The molecular functions of these newly identified cancer driver genes are discussed, and they were known readers, writers, or erasers of histone marks on histone H2 and H3 tails that are very close to each other, suggesting that these factors might functionally interact and affect common pathways. The studies on these newly identified tumor suppressors will shed light on ccRCC tumorigenesis and development, and will likely lead to development of novel therapeutic interventions for ccRCC patients.  aPublisher supplied data 0aVHL 0aPBRM1 0aBAP1 0aSETD2 0aJARID1C/KDM5A1 aTesta, Joseph R.1 aYang, Haifeng0 tCancer Genetics.g2015 May, v. 208 p.206-214dElsevier Inc.x2210-77627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cancergen.2015.02.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02855naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002600148245009800174520157000272592002801842650001301870650003101883650001601914650001301930650001601943650001401959650001901973650001401992650001602006650001102022653002002033653001602053653001502069653001902084653001302103653001602116700002302132700002602155700002402181773012402205856008302329852000902412655001202421IND60775501920221119091951.0220531e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077550192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jaap.2022.1055272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSriram, Srinivasa Rao10aProspects of spray pyrolysis technique for gas sensor applications – A comprehensive review  aNanostructured materials have been extensively used in various applications such as photocatalytic activity, solar cells, electrochromic devices, batteries, supercapacitors, and gas sensors. Nowadays, many advanced synthesis techniques are available to construct these nanostructured materials, including hydrothermal, atomic layer deposition, spin coating, spray pyrolysis, electroplating, sputtering, and chemical vapour deposition techniques. The spray pyrolysis method is a simple, low-cost, flexible, non-vacuum requirement, applicable on a large scale, extreme productivity, and a scalable continuous aerosol process for fabricating different nanostructured materials and thin films. This method efficiently synthesizes multiple metal oxides and chemical compounds with other morphological nanostructures. The effect of controlled deposition parameters includes substrate temperature, flow rate, deposition time, the distance between nozzle and substrate, precursor solution, and carrier gas type on nanostructures' morphology such as nanorods and nanowires, nanospheres, and nanoflowers. The morphology of a nanostructured material significantly affects its gas sensing characteristics, including selectivity, sensitivity, response, and recovery times. This review focuses on a detailed discussion of the basic principles and recent advances in the spray pyrolysis method to deposit various nanostructures. Finally, this paper explores the prospects and challenges in spray pyrolysis deposition for gas sensing applications for the future research community.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3aelectrochemical capacitors 3ananoflowers 3ananorods 3ananospheres 3ananowires 3aphotocatalysis 3apyrolysis 3atemperature 3avapors 0aSpray pyrolysis 0aGas sensors 0aThin films 0aNanostructures 0aResponse 0aSelectivity1 aParne, Saidi Reddy1 aPothukanuri, Nagaraju1 aEdla, Damodar Reddy0 tJournal of analytical and applied pyrolysis.g2022 June, v. 164 p.105527-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6382x0165-23707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaap.2022.1055273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03089naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005700147245011400204300001600318520187900334592002802213650002002241650001902261650001902280650001102299650002102310650001602331650001902347650002202366650001002388650002902398700002402427700001702451700001502468773014102483856008202624852000902706655001202715IND60632564320221118083805.0200718e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063256432DNAL7 a10.1007/s12524-018-0900-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSelim, Serdar1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5631-625310aSemi-automatic Tree Detection from Images of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Using Object-Based Image Analysis Method  ap. 193-200.  aThe aim of this study is detection of trees at low cost, fast and reliably through object-based image analysis method by using high-resolution unmanned aerial vehicles data. The study consists of three basic process stages. In the first stage, high-resolution aerial photographs were obtained by using unmanned aerial vehicles. Aerial photographs with approximately 1 cm spatial resolution were obtained from 30 m. flight height with 80% front overlap and 80% side overlap. Orthorectification, mosaicking, georeferencing and filtering processes were performed on the obtained photographs in order to make them ready for the analysis. Orthoimage in three spectral bands (Red, Green, Blue) and digital surface model were generated by processing the aerial images. The second stage of the study constitutes the most important process steps of object-based classification: They are segmentation and classification. In this phase, various parameters such as scale, shape and integrity were used to obtain the best result. Furthermore, accuracy assessments were performed through field observations. In the classification process step, a specified set of rules applied to segmentation result objects; thus, trees and other classes were determined in the study area. The generation of the rule sets was performed using the height information obtained from digital surface model and spectral data collected from orthoimages. Accuracy analysis was performed in the last stage of the study. The number of trees determined in the classification step was compared with the known number of the trees in the field. As the result of comparison, tree numbers and crown widths were found to be consistent. This study tests and implements a method that detects trees at low cost, fast and high accuracy which can be used in ecological studies and specially in determination of tree density.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3ageoreferencing 3aimage analysis 3amodels 3aorthophotography 3aphotographs 3aremote sensing 3aspectral analysis 3atrees 3aunmanned aerial vehicles1 aSonmez, Namik Kemal1 aCoslu, Mesut1 aOnur, Isin0 tJournal of the Indian Society of Remote Sensing.g2019 Feb., v. 47, no. 2 p.193-200dSpringer IndiawJournal:J000001231x0255-660X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12524-018-0900-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02118naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245008100170300001400251520099800265592002801263650001701291650002301308650001001331650001101341650001701352650000901369650001901378650001801397650000701415650001401422650002101436650001601457650001501473700002901488773012301517856008301640852000901723655001201732IND60625300120221122232243.0190624e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062530012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cofs.2018.06.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTola, Yetenayet B10aNovel processing methods: updates on acidified vegetables thermal processing  ap. 64-69.  aConventional thermal processing of low acid foods experiences significant quality loses due to intense thermal processing schedules.

Chromosome numbers and compositions varied between the microspore-derived plants examined. Plant ‘GB-17’ contained 17 chromosomes, of which ten and seven were derived from B. oleracea (genome C) and B. rapa (genome A), respectively. Plant ‘GB-18’ contained 18 chromosomes, including nine C and nine A chromosomes. Plant ‘GB-19’ was an allodiploid plant that contained 19 chromosomes, including nine C and ten A chromosomes. Plant ‘GB-20’ contained 20 chromosomes, including eight C and 12 A chromosomes. Plant ‘GB-26’ contained 26 chromosomes, including 12 C and 14 A chromosomes. Recombinant chromosomes were observed in plants ‘GB-17’ and ‘GB-20’. The morphological features and meiotic behaviour of plant ‘GB-19’ were further examined and compared with the two parental plants. Chromosomal homoeology between the A and C genomes was revealed. Our results provide credible evidence to identify the different chromosomes between the two genomes.

Most previous studies of avian systems investigated the effects of individual personality on offspring recruitment and other fitness correlates, even in species with biparental care. Here we tested the potential for behavioural similarity within mated pairs of wild eastern bluebirds to impact reproductive success. Specifically, we quantified nest defence behaviour of males and females to address three hypotheses: (1) the individual personality hypothesis, which predicts that individuals with more aggressive personalities will have more nestlings survive to fledging; (2) the pair coordination hypothesis, which predicts similarly behaving pairs will have more nestlings survive to fledging; and (3) the pair intensity hypothesis, which predicts pairs with more aggressive personalities will have more nestlings survive to fledging. Pairs that had similar nest defence strategies produced more fledglings in support of the pair coordination hypothesis. We found no support for either the individual personality hypothesis or the pair intensity hypothesis. Thus, particularly in species with biparental care, it is important to consider the behaviour of both pair members to predict effects on reproductive success.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSialia sialis 3aanimal behavior 3abirds 3afemales 3afledglings 3amales 3anestlings 3anests 3aprogeny 3areproductive success 0abehavioural compatibility 0anest defence 0apair coordination 0apersonality 0asimulated territorial intrusion1 aGrindstaff, Jennifer L.0 tAnimal behaviour.g2015 Feb., v. 100 p.174-182dElsevier LtdaThe Association for the Study of Animal BehaviourwJournal:jnl45841x0003-34727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2014.12.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02522naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245011100168520141500279592002801694650002301722650001101745650001601756650001901772653003301791653002601824653002801850653002201878653003001900700001301930700001901943700001601962773009801978856008702076852000902163655001202172IND60697018920221119043240.0200726e20200715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069701892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.1151862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Weicong10aTowards novel low temperature thermodynamic cycle: A critical review originated from organic Rankine cycle  aAs one of the most basic optimization factors of organic Rankine cycle, the working fluid greatly affects the development of organic Rankine cycle and even others low- and medium-temperature thermodynamic cycles. Towards novel thermodynamic cycle using low- and medium-grade energy, a critical review originated from the working fluid in organic Rankine cycle is presented. Three common-applied methods are presented firstly, namely trial method, analytical method and decoupling method. The recent progress of working fluid selection is classified, summarized and compared. Then, the dilemma of current research on thermodynamic cycle is critically analyzed and discussed, which could be summarized as three points: the restriction of limiting performance, the contradiction of working fluid selection and the misunderstanding on the application of zeotropic working fluid. What’s more, the in-depth reason for the above issues from the traditional cycle structure is explored. Finally, from the viewpoints of fundamental research and linked methodology on novel thermodynamic cycle construction, several future development directions are put forward. The purpose of this paper is to summarize the research results, discuss the existing problems and provide suggestions for the future development. This review hopes to promote the development of novel thermodynamic cycle using low- and medium-grade energy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical methods 3aenergy 3atemperature 3athermodynamics 0aLow- and medium-grade energy 0aOrganic Rankine cycle 0aWorking fluid selection 0aZeotropic mixture 0aNovel thermodynamic cycle1 aZhao, Li1 aMao, Samuel S.1 aDeng, Shuai0 tApplied energy.g2020 July 15, v. 270 p.115186-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.1151863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02589naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001400144245013000158300002000288500001900308520108000327592002801407650002101435650001101456650001001467650001301477650001401490650002201504650001401526653001101540653003601551653001001587653003301597653002001630700001701650700001501667700001701682700005301699700001701752700001601769700001801785700005501803700002001858773014201878856007802020852000902098655001202107IND60735370620221119205443.0210423e20210406xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073537062DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.0c226202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Min10aFe(Co)OOH Dynamically Stable Interface Based on Self-Sacrificial Reconstruction for Long-Term Electrochemical Water Oxidation  ap. 17450-17458.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aFeOOH on the real catalytic interface for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is chemically unstable to dissolve in alkaline media. Herein, based on the perspective of the dynamically stable interface, we purposely design the well-dispersed nanorod arrays of CoMoO₄ as a host on activated iron foam (IF) to realize the optimal redeposition of FeOOH, constructing a self-sacrificial template rich in the FeOOH surface. Notably, at long-time oxidation potential, the precatalyst FeOOH–CoMoO₄ can realize MoO₄²– dissolution and redeposition of Co oxyhydroxides on FeOOH host simultaneously, constructing a dynamically stable Fe(Co)OOH interface. The introduction of CoOOH improves conductivity and provides synergistic effect with FeOOH to lower the energy barrier for OER and maintain long-time stability, eventually exhibiting a low overpotential of 298 mV to reach the current density of 100 mA cm–² and high stability over 60 h. This work demonstrates the feasibility of manipulating metal dissolution–redeposition process for a dynamically stable interface.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectrochemistry 3aenergy 3afoams 3ananorods 3aoxidation 3aoxygen production 3asynergism 0aCoMoO4 0aself-sacrificial reconstruction 0aFeOOH 0adynamically stable interface 0awater oxidation1 aXie, Jing-Yi1 aYu, Wen-Li1 aCao, Yu-Ning1 aDong, Bin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4817-62891 aZhou, Ya-Nan1 aWang, Fuli,1 aLi, Qing-Zong1 aZhou, Yu-Lu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2859-06261 aChai, Yong-Ming0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2021 Apr. 06, v. 13, no. 15 p.17450-17458dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c226203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02294naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245012700171300001600298520111400314592002801428650000801456650001301464650001201477650001201489650001301501650001601514653004001530653004301570653003301613653002201646700001801668700002001686700002001706773009801726856008701824852000901911655001201920IND60564598520221117070702.0180830e20170601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056459852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.03.0532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Hui-Jeong10aCooling performance measurement of two cross-flow indirect evaporative coolers in general and regenerative operation modes  ap. 268-277.  aThe main purpose of this study was to evaluate the cooling performances of two different types of cross-flow indirect evaporative coolers (IECs) operated in two different operation modes: general and regenerative. The cooling performances of the IECs were tested in each operation mode in an environmental chamber. In the general mode, the secondary air stream passing through the wet channels was the return air from the conditioned zone; whereas, in the regenerative mode, a portion of the primary air leaving the dry channels was redirected to the secondary channels. The IEC performances were measured under constant primary air inlet temperature and humidity ratio with variations of the primary airflow. As indexes of the IEC performance, the wet-bulb effectiveness and cooling capacity of both IECs in each operation mode were estimated based on the measurement data. The experimental results revealed that, in the general operation mode, both IECs exhibited higher sensible cooling performances in terms of wet-bulb effectiveness than in the regenerative mode in a 100% outdoor air system application.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aair flow 3acoolers 3acooling 3ahumidity 3atemperature 0aIndirect evaporative cooling system 0aCross-flow indirect evaporative cooler 0aDew-point evaporative cooler 0aEnergy efficiency1 aHam, Sang-Woo1 aYoon, Dong-Seob1 aJeong, Jae-Weon0 tApplied energy.g2017 June 01, v. 195 p.268-277dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.03.0533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02548naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002400155245013400179300001600313520124100329592002801570650001301598650001401611650001101625650000901636650002401645650001401669650001701683650001901700650001401719650001401733653002801747653001001775700005701785700002601842700002801868700003101896773011201927856009002039852000902129655001202138IND60613457120221119150231.0190405e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061345712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anireprosci.2018.08.0462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartinez-Ros, Paula10aEffects of short-term intravaginal progestagens on the onset and features of estrus, preovulatory LH surge and ovulation in sheep  ap. 317-323.  aIn the present study, there was a comparison among classical long-term progestagen (fluorogestone acetate) protocols for synchronization of estrus and ovulation (14 days; group FGA14, n = 9 ewes) and short-term protocols based on 7 days of progestagen treatment plus a dose of prostaglandin F2α at either insertion (PG-FGA7, n = 11) or removal (FGA7-PG, n = 12). There were no significant differences in the ovulation rate and progesterone secretion among treatments. The FGA7-PG group, however, had a similar percentage of ewes expressing estrous behavior than the group FGA14 (90.9 and 100%, respectively, with a trend for a lesser percentage in the PG-FGA7 group, 63.6%) and about 90% of the ewes in the FGA7-PG group had the preovulatory surge release of LH 8 h after the onset of estrous behavior. These features may be related to a greater number of preovulatory follicles during growing phases (P < 0.05) and a greater plasma estradiol concentration (P < 0.05) in this group than in the classical 14-day group, which suggest these are more functional preovulatory follicles. In conclusion, therefore, the use of the FGA7-PG treatment may favor efficiency of progestagen-based protocols for reproductive management.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetates 3aestradiol 3aestrus 3aewes 3aluteinizing hormone 3aovulation 3aprogesterone 3aprostaglandins 3aprotocols 3asecretion 0aEstrous synchronization 0aOvine1 aAstiz, Susana1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9718-09031 aGarcia-Rosello, Empar1 aRios-Abellan, Alejandro1 aGonzález-Bulnes, Antonio,0 tAnimal reproduction science.g2018 Oct., v. 197 p.317-323dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl11636x0378-43207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anireprosci.2018.08.0463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02168naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245004300173300001600216520129600232592002801528653002201556653002101578653001901599653001301618653001501631653001401646700001901660773009201679856008601771852000901857655001201866IND60596147720221117064100.0180615e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059614772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.wavemoti.2016.09.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVenegas, Rodolfo10aAcoustics of sorptive porous materials  ap. 162-181.  aSound propagation in conventional rigid-frame porous materials is affected by the viscosity of the saturating gas and the heat transfer between the gas and the solid frame. This paper investigates the acoustical properties of hierarchical porous materials that support mass transfer processes, such as sorption and different types of diffusion, in addition to the previously mentioned effects. The two-scale asymptotic expansion method of homogenisation for periodic media is used to derive the macroscopic acoustic description. This description allowed to conclude that, at the leading order, neither sorption nor diffusion affects the macroscopic fluid flow through the material. However, the effective compressibility is significantly modified by these physical phenomena. Specifically, the real part of the low-frequency bulk modulus can take values much smaller than those found in conventional materials while its imaginary part is increased around the characteristic frequency associated with diffusion. As a consequence, the sound waves are slowed down and more attenuated at low frequencies. The results are exemplified for sorptive porous, fibrous, and granular materials and the influence of their microstructural descriptors on their effective acoustical properties is discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 0aSound propagation 0aPorous materials 0aHomogenisation 0aSorption 0aAdsorption 0aDiffusion1 aBoutin, Claude0 tWave motion.g2017 Jan., v. 68 p.162-181dElsevier B.V.wJournal:26775x0165-21257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wavemoti.2016.09.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02898naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002400189245008900213300002000302506007600322520110900398592002801507506003701535650001501572650001701587650001801604650002001622650001401642650001201656650001101668650001701679650002401696653002201720653002401742653001501766653002601781653002701807653002201834653001701856653002301873653002001896653002401916700002301940700002001963700002301983700002602006700001602032700002402048700002302072700002202095773009902117856008302216852000902299655001202308IND60647439520221207103150.0191231e20190502xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064743952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cell.2019.03.0072doi7 aPMC64996732pmcid7 a309826012pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeneke, Victoria E.10aSelf-Organized Nuclear Positioning Synchronizes the Cell Cycle in Drosophila Embryos  ap. 925-941.e17.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe synchronous cleavage divisions of early embryogenesis require coordination of the cell-cycle oscillator, the dynamics of the cytoskeleton, and the cytoplasm. Yet, it remains unclear how spatially restricted biochemical signals are integrated with physical properties of the embryo to generate collective dynamics. Here, we show that synchronization of the cell cycle in Drosophila embryos requires accurate nuclear positioning, which is regulated by the cell-cycle oscillator through cortical contractility and cytoplasmic flows. We demonstrate that biochemical oscillations are initiated by local Cdk1 inactivation and spread through the activity of phosphatase PP1 to generate cortical myosin II gradients. These gradients cause cortical and cytoplasmic flows that control proper nuclear positioning. Perturbations of PP1 activity and optogenetic manipulations of cortical actomyosin disrupt nuclear spreading, resulting in loss of cell-cycle synchrony. We conclude that mitotic synchrony is established by a self-organized mechanism that integrates the cell-cycle oscillator and embryo mechanics.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDrosophila 3acytoskeleton 3aembryogenesis 3aenzyme activity 3amechanics 3amitosis 3amyosin 3aoptogenetics 3aphysical properties 0aself-organization 0anuclear positioning 0acell cycle 0aembryonic development 0acortical contractility 0acytoplasmic flows 0aoptogenetics 0aactomyosin network 0asynchronization 0acollective dynamics1 aPuliafito, Alberto1 aKrueger, Daniel1 aNarla, Avaneesh V.1 aDe Simone, Alessandro1 aPrimo, Luca1 aVergassola, Massimo1 aDe Renzis, Stefano1 aDi Talia, Stefano0 tCell.g2019 May 02, v. 177, no. 4 p.925-941.e17dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11769x0092-86747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2019.03.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02719naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245019600174300001400370520112200384592002801506650001401534650002301548650001701571650002101588650002101609650001701630650001801647650001801665650001101683650002101694650001401715650001701729650001801746650001401764653001701778653001601795653003101811653002101842653000901863700002901872700001501901700002701916700001901943700002201962700002101984773010202005856008502107852000902192655001202201IND60609336420221122000404.0190628e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060933642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2018.07.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTesone, Agustina I.10aVolcanic ash from Puyehue-Cordón Caulle Volcanic Complex and Calbuco promote a differential response of pro-inflammatory and oxidative stress mediators on human conjunctival epithelial cells  ap. 87-97.  aVolcanic ash could pose a hazard to the ocular surface as it is constantly exposed to environmental particles. We exposed conjunctival cells to Puyehue-Cordón Caulle volcanic complex (PCCVC) or Calbuco ash particles and evaluated proliferation, viability, apoptosis, MUC1 expression, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and oxidative stress markers. Ash particles from these volcanoes vary in size, composition, and morphology. Our results demonstrate that PCCVC but not Calbuco ash particles induce cytotoxicity on human conjunctival epithelial cells viewed as a decrease in cell proliferation and the transmembrane mucin MUC1 expression; a pro-inflammatory response mediated by IL-6 and IL-8; and an imbalance of the redox environment leading to protein oxidative damage. This is the first in vitro study that assesses the biological effect of volcanic ash particles on human conjunctival epithelial cells and the involvement of inflammatory mediators and oxidative stress as the mechanisms of damage. Our results could provide a better understanding of the ocular symptoms manifested by people living near volcanic areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3acell proliferation 3acytotoxicity 3aepithelial cells 3ain vitro studies 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-6 3ainterleukin-8 3amucins 3aoxidative stress 3aviability 3avolcanic ash 3avolcanic land 3avolcanoes 0aVolcanic ash 0aConjunctiva 0aPro-inflammatory cytokines 0aOxidative stress 0aMUC11 aLasagni Vitar, Romina M.1 aTau, Julia1 aMaglione, Guillermo A.1 aLlesuy, Susana1 aTasat, Deborah R.1 aBerra, Alejandro0 tEnvironmental research.g2018 Nov., v. 167 p.87-97dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12442x0013-93517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2018.07.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03311naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001800144245010800162300002000270500001900290520159800309592002801907650001301935650001101948650002101959650002101980650001202001650001502013650001502028650001402043650001302057650002102070653003002091653002702121653002702148653002002175653002402195700001902219700005402238700001702292700001702309700005502326700005702381700005502438700005602493700001502549773014202564856007802706852000902784655001202793IND60735370920221119205402.0210423e20210413xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073537092DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.0c229232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Ruicong10aAmmonium Intercalation Induced Expanded 1T-Rich Molybdenum Diselenides for Improved Lithium Ion Storage  ap. 17459-17466.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aTransition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), particularly molybdenum diselenides (MoSe₂), have the merits of their unique two-dimensional (2D) layered structures, large interlayer spacing (∼0.64 nm), good electrical conductivities, and high theoretical capacities when applied in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) as anode materials. However, MoSe₂ remains suffering from inferior stability as well as unsatisfactory rate capability because of the unavoidable volume expansion and sluggish charge transport during lithiation-delithiation cycles. Herein, we develop a simultaneous reduction-intercalation strategy to synthesize expanded MoSe₂ (e-MoSe₂) with an interlayer spacing of 0.98 nm and a rich 1T phase (53.7%) by rationally selecting the safe precursors of ethylenediamine (NH₂C₂H₄NH₂), selenium dioxide (SeO₂), and sodium molybdate (Na₂MoO₄). It is noteworthy that NH₂C₂H₄NH₂ can effectively reduce SeO₂ and MoO₄²– forming MoSe₂ nanosheets; in the meantime, the generated ammonium (NH₄⁺) efficiently intercalates between MoSe₂ layers, leading to charge transfer, thus stabilizing 1T phases. The obtained e-MoSe₂ exhibits high capacities of 778.99 and 611.40 mAh g–¹ at 0.2 and 1 C, respectively, together with excellent cycling stability (retaining >90% initial capacity at 0.2 C over 100 charge–discharge cycles). It is believed that the material design strategy proposed in this paper provides a favorable reference for the synthesis of other transition metal selenides with improved electrochemical performance for battery applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium 3aanodes 3aelectrochemistry 3aethylenediamines 3alithium 3amolybdenum 3ananosheets 3aselenides 3aselenium 3asodium molybdate 0atwo-dimensional materials 0amolybdenum diselenides 0aammonium intercalation 0aextended layers 0alithium-ion battery1 aWang, Hongchen1 aChang, Jin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7449-40801 aYu, Chenyang1 aDai, Henghan1 aChen, Qiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8592-95181 aZhou, Jinyuan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0284-105X1 aYu, Haidong1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7124-36301 aSun, Gengzhi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8000-89121 aHuang, Wei0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2021 Apr. 13, v. 13, no. 15 p.17459-17466dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c229233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02667naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245009000172300001800262520115400280592002801434650001401462650001601476650002701492650001401519650001701533650001201550650002301562650001001585650001801595650001301613650001301626650000901639650000701648650002101655650002301676650001201699650002701711653002901738653003001767653001801797653002601815700002101841700001801862700001901880700001701899773013701916856008702053852000902140655001202149IND60586973020221119204933.0190131e20180401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058697302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2017.11.1352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTontul, İsmail10aFunctional properties of chickpea protein isolates dried by refractance window drying  ap. 1253-1259.  aIn the present study, the effect of Refractance Window (RW) drying on the functional properties of chickpea protein isolates was investigated and compared to freeze drying at different pH levels. The functional properties investigated were protein solubility, water and oil holding capacity, emulsifying properties, foaming properties, flocculation and coalescence indices and textural properties. The solubility, oil holding capacity and foam stability of the freeze dried protein isolates were determined to be higher than the RW dried samples. On the other hand, the RW dried samples had better water holding capacity and emulsion stability compared to the freeze dried protein isolates. The emulsion activity index, flocculation and coalescence indices of the chickpea protein isolates prepared by different drying techniques showed different tendencies depending on the pH level. Freeze dried protein isolates exhibited higher gelation ability than RW dried samples according to the texture profile analysis. This study clearly showed that the drying technique used in the preparation of protein isolates can affect their functional properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3achickpeas 3aemulsifying 3aemulsifying properties 3aemulsions 3aflocculation 3afoaming 3afoaming properties 3afoams 3afreeze drying 3afreezing 3agelation 3aoils 3apH 3aprotein isolates 3aprotein solubility 3atexture 3awater holding capacity 0aChickpea protein isolate 0aRefractance window drying 0aFreeze drying 0aFunctional properties1 aKasimoglu, Zehra1 aAsik, Serenay1 aAtbakan, Tugce1 aTopuz, Ayhan0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2018 Apr. 01, v. 109 p.1253-1259dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2017.11.1353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02604naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006500150245015300215300001600368520139300384592002801777653002301805653001901828653001601847653002201863700002201885700002201907700002801929700002501957700006601982773013702048856008402185852000902269655001202278IND60553762720221121220915.0161023s2016    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055376272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.medici.2016.04.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUstinavičienė, Ruta1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4512-256510aProblematic computer game use as expression of Internet addiction and its association with self-rated health in the Lithuanian adolescent population  ap. 199-204.  aComputers and the Internet have become an integral part of today's life. Problematic gaming is related to adolescent's health. The aim of our study was to evaluate the prevalence of Internet addiction among 13–18-year-old schoolchildren and its relation to sex, age, and time spent playing computer games, game type, and subjective health evaluation.A total of 1806 schoolchildren aged 13–18 years were interviewed. The evaluation of Internet addiction was conducted by the Diagnostic Questionnaire according to Young's methodology. The relation between the choice of computer games type, time spent while playing computer games and respondents’ Internet addiction were assessed by using multivariate logistic regression analysis.One-tenth (10.6%) of the boys and 7.7% of the girls aged 13–18 years were Internet addicted. Internet addiction was associated with the type of computer game (action or combat vs. logic) among boys (OR=2.42; 95% CI, 1.03–5.67) and with the amount of time spent playing computer games per day during the last month (≥5 vs. <5h) among girls (OR=2.10; 95% CI, 1.19–3.70). The boys who were addicted to the Internet were more likely to rate their health poorer in comparison to their peers who were not addicted to the Internet (OR=2.48; 95% CI, 1.33–4.62).Internet addiction was significantly associated with poorer self-rated health among boys.  aPublisher supplied data 0aInternet addiction 0aComputer games 0aAdolescents 0aSelf-rated health1 aŠkėmienė, Lina1 aLukšienė, Dalia1 aRadišauskas, Ričardas1 aKalinienė, Gintarė1 aVasilavičius, Paulius1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0542-09980 tMedicina.g2016, v. 52 p.199-204dElsevier Urban & Partner Sp. z o.o.aThe Lithuanian University of Health Sciencesx1010-660X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.medici.2016.04.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03489naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002800147245016600175300001800341520178300359592002802142650001802170650002502188650001102213650001402224650001402238650001002252650003702262650001502299650002202314650001402336650001402350650001502364650001802379651001002397651001902407700002402426700002402450700003002474700002402504700002402528700001302552700002202565700002702587700002802614700002402642700002502666700002202691700002202713773011002735856008102845852000902926655001202935IND60488044920221120153021.0160219e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048804492DNAL7 a10.1007/s00436-015-4847-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVadivalagan, Chithravel10aGenetic deviation in geographically close populations of the dengue vector Aedes aegypti (Diptera: Culicidae): influence of environmental barriers in South India  ap. 1149-1160.  aMosquitoes are vectors of devastating pathogens and parasites, causing millions of deaths every year. Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral infection found in tropical and subtropical regions around the world. Recently, dengue transmission has strongly increased in urban and semiurban areas, becoming a major international public health concern. Aedes aegypti (Diptera: Culicidae) is a primary vector of dengue. Shedding light on genetic deviation in A. aegypti populations is of crucial importance to fully understand their molecular ecology and evolution. In this research, haplotype and genetic analyses were conducted using individuals of A. aegypti from 31 localities in the north, southeast, northeast and central regions of Tamil Nadu (South India). The mitochondrial DNA region of cytochrome c oxidase 1 (CO1) gene was used as marker for the analyses. Thirty-one haplotypes sequences were submitted to GenBank and authenticated. The complete haplotype set included 64 haplotypes from various geographical regions clustered into three groups (lineages) separated by three fixed mutational steps, suggesting that the South Indian Ae. aegypti populations were pooled and are linked with West Africa, Columbian and Southeast Asian lineages. The genetic and haplotype diversity was low, indicating reduced gene flow among close populations of the vector, due to geographical barriers such as water bodies. Lastly, the negative values for neutrality tests indicated a bottle-neck effect and supported for low frequency of polymorphism among the haplotypes. Overall, our results add basic knowledge to molecular ecology of the dengue vector A. aegypti, providing the first evidence for multiple introductions of Ae. aegypti populations from Columbia and West Africa in South India.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAedes aegypti 3acytochrome-c oxidase 3adengue 3aevolution 3agene flow 3agenes 3agenetic techniques and protocols 3ahaplotypes 3amitochondrial DNA 3aparasites 3apathogens 3asubtropics 3asurface water 3aIndia 3aWestern Africa1 aKarthika, Pushparaj1 aMurugan, Kadarkarai1 aPanneerselvam, Chellasamy1 aPaulpandi, Manickam1 aMadhiyazhagan, Pari1 aWei, Hui1 aAziz, Al Thabiani1 aAlsalhi, Mohamad Saleh1 aDevanesan, Sandhanasamy1 aNicoletti, Marcello1 aParamasivan, Rajaiah1 aDinesh, Devakumar1 aBenelli, Giovanni0 tParasitology research.g2016 Mar., v. 115, no. 3 p.1149-1160dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0932-01137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-015-4847-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03358naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001700154245011400171300001600285520205300301592002802354650002702382650002002409650002302429650002302452650000902475650001002484650002102494650001102515650001002526650001002536650002302546650001702569650000902586650001402595650001202609650001002621651002902631700002002660700002102680773011402701856008802815852000902903655001202912IND50074083220221119133457.0150206e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007408322DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1439-0418.2012.01738.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWhite, J. A.10aBiased sex ratios, mating frequency and Nosema prevalence in European corn borer, at low population densities  ap. 195-201.  aThe widespread adoption of transgenic Bt maize in the Midwestern United States has led to historically low populations of the European corn borer, Ostrinia nubilalis (Hübner). Reduced population densities might influence mating and/or disease dynamics in O. nubilalis, potentially amplifying or diminishing the benefits of areawide suppression. We hypothesized that O. nubilalis mating success and infection by the microsporidium Nosema pyrausta Paillot would be decreased in areas of low pest density. Over 2 years (2009, 2010), we collected moths from black‐light traps, evaluating sex ratio, mating status and infection by Nosema. We found several locations that exhibited female‐biased sex ratios: to our knowledge, this is the first report of female‐biased sex ratios in O. nubilalis in the Midwestern United States. Despite this bias and subsequent rareness of males, proportion mating was still high (>90%) in most locations, and there were no statistically significant relationships among population density (as measured by black‐light trap catch), sex ratio and proportion of female moths that were mated. Nosema prevalence was highly variable among locations, ranging from 0% to 87% of female moths infected. Nosema infection was not significantly related to population density in either year, but was positively associated with sex ratio in 2009. It is possible that Nosema or some other microbe may be manipulating reproduction in O. nubilalis. Regardless of mechanism, our results indicate that Nosema is being maintained in O. nubilalis, which is an encouraging indication that this important natural enemy may continue to provide biological control to complement transgenic technology. Additional surveys are warranted to better understand the extent of female‐biased sex ratios in low‐density populations of O. nubilalis. Population models developed for studying the risk of Bt resistance in this pest should consider the possible impact of female‐biased sex ratios (vs. the conventional 1 : 1 sex ratio).  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus thuringiensis 3aNosema pyrausta 3aOstrinia nubilalis 3abiological control 3acorn 3amales 3amating frequency 3amodels 3amoths 3apests 3apopulation density 3areproduction 3arisk 3asex ratio 3asurveys 3atraps 3aMidwestern United States1 aBurkness, E.

The animals were anaesthetised with ether and the anaesthesia was deepened with nembuthal injected intraperitoneally. The chinchillas were then transcardially perfused with 0.4 L of 4% buffered paraformaldehyde, and testes, epididymides, and vasa deferentia were collected. The tunica albuginea from one testis from each chinchilla was stained as whole-mount preparation. The tissues were cut into 12 μm-thick cryostat sections, and processed for double-immunofluorescence method. In all organs studied, the most abundant nerve fibres were dopamine β hydroxylase positive (DβH⁺). Some of them contained neuropeptide Y (NPY). Sporadically NPY-positive-only nerve fibres were found. Single DβH⁺ nerve terminals contained also galanine. Small numbers of the nerve fibres supplying studied organs were stained for substance P (SP) and calitonin gene related peptide (CGRP). Almost all SP⁺ fibres were also CGRP⁺, whereas single CGRP⁺ nerves were SPimmunonegative. Some nerve terminals were immunoreactive to vesicular acetylcholine transporter and vasoactive intestinal peptide. The organs studied were innervated unevenly. The highest density of the nerves was found in the areas of the tunica albuginea adjacent to the mesorchial border of the testis and their number gradually decreased towards the free border of the gonad. None of the vascular tissue of the testicular parenchyma was free of the nerve fibres, except sporadically encountered DβH⁺ nerves which supply seminiferous tubules. Within the head of the epididymis a moderate number of nerve terminals were found, but in the body and tail of the organ the number of nerves gradually increased. The vas deferens was supplied with very numerous nerve fibres. There were no differences in the density of the innervation between the funicular and abdominal part of the vas deferens.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChinchilla (Chinchillidae) 3aacetylcholine 3aanesthesia 3aanimals 3adopamine 3aepididymis 3agenes 3ainnervation 3amales 3anerve fibers 3anerve tissue 3aneuropeptide Y 3aseminiferous tubules 3asubstance P 3atail 3avasoactive intestinal peptide 0achinchilla 0amale genital organs 0ainnervation1 aSzczurkowski, Aleksander1 aDudek, Agnieszka1 aKaleczyc, Jerzy0 tBulletin of the Veterinary Institute in Puławy =.g2015 Dec. 01, v. 59, no. 4 p.547-556dSciendowJournal:J000000137x2300-32357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1515/bvip-2015-00823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04489naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001700152245009800169300001600267520283100283592002803114650001603142650002203158650000803180650001003188650002503198650001403223650000903237650001003246650001403256650001903270650000903289650001703298650001203315650001703327650001603344650002103360650001503381650001003396650001503406650001903421650002203440650001103462650002303473650001503496650001303511650001603524650001203540650001103552650001303563651001003576700001803586700001503604700001403619700001703633700001803650773011903668856005503787852000903842655001203851IND4472496520221119114109.0120927e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447249652DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1745-4530.2010.00623.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSimpson, R.,10aTime‐temperature indicator to monitor cold chain distribution of fresh salmon (salmo salar)  ap. 742-750.  aThis article summarizes the application and validation of a specific temperature‐time indicator (TTI) to monitor the shelf life of refrigerated salmon throughout its cold chain distribution. Reaction kinetics of the spoilage process was characterized by determining the kinetics for microbial population growth and chemical degradation (break down of nucleotides). The combined effect of these reactions on perceived organoleptic quality deterioration (appearance, odor, texture, gapping and color) was measured by a trained sensory panel. The TTI color change reaction from green to yellow was monitored with a colorimeter. The activation energies (Ea) for the spoilage reactions in the salmon and the TTI color change reaction were determined and compared for the required similarity. The color change reaction in the TTIs had Ea of 22–23 Kcal/mol, while the microbial growth and chemical degradation reactions were found to have Ea in the order of 17 and 15 Kcal/mol, respectively. Performance of the TTIs was tested under controlled constant and variable time‐temperature storage histories by comparing TTIs color change readings with sensory panel scores. Additionally, TTIs and data loggers were placed in a shipment of refrigerated salmon that traveled from Puerto Montt, Chile, to Gainesville, FL, U.S.A. via a combination of truck and air. Results showed that the TTIs used in this study with Ea of 22–23 Kcal/mol were capable of predicting the shelf life of refrigerated salmon within 10% error in cases of moderate temperature abuse (0–7C). However, TTIs with lower Ea closer to 18–19 Kcal/mol would be needed to accurately predict shelf life if product were to be subjected to more extreme temperature abuse with temperatures reaching 12–14C. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: The list of products monitored by time‐temperature integrators or indicators (TTIs) has been steadily increasing, these include: fresh fruits and vegetables, fresh fish, flowers, frozen foods, dairy products, chocolates, photographic films, medical films, drugs and vaccines, cosmetics, beer, dog food, etc. TTIs can be used to monitor the distribution, and food and biological materials, and more diverse products. A tentative classification of the various applications of TTIs in food products would be: 1 monitoring the distribution and storage; 2 optimization of inventory management; 3 shelf‐life prediction; and 4 sanitary and quality prediction. Several studies have focused on the application of indicators for frozen and chilled foods. Our studies in the evaluation of chilled fish fillets have shown that indicators can be used satisfactorily to evaluate the quality of the product during distribution. The distribution of fish is one of the areas that had the greatest potential for implementation of the TTIs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalmo salar 3aactivation energy 3aair 3abeers 3achemical degradation 3achocolate 3acold 3acolor 3acosmetics 3adairy products 3adogs 3afish fillets 3aflowers 3afrozen foods 3ainventories 3amicrobial growth 3amonitoring 3aodors 3aprediction 3araw vegetables 3areaction kinetics 3asalmon 3asensory evaluation 3ashelf life 3aspoilage 3atemperature 3atexture 3atrucks 3avaccines 3aChile1 aALMONACID, S.1 aNUÑEZ, H.1 aPINTO, M.1 aABAKAROV, A.1 aTeixeira, A.,0 tJournal of food process engineering.g2012 Oct., v. 35, no. 5 p.742-750dBlackwell Publishing Incx0145-88767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-4530.2010.00623.x  aDNAL 7aarticle01841naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245012700169300001800296520059200314592002800906650004400934650002500978650001201003650001801015650001501033650000901048650001501057650002301072700001801095700002201113700001901135700001901154700002001173700002301193700002101216773011601237856008101353852000901434655001201443IND60120865620221123032928.0150212e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012086562DNAL7 a10.1007/s00216-013-6824-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSeichter, Felicia10aMultivariate determination of 13CO 2/ 12CO 2 ratios in exhaled mouse breath with mid-infrared hollow waveguide gas sensors  ap. 4945-4951.  aThe¹²CO₂/¹³CO₂isotope ratio is a well-known marker in breath for a variety of biochemical processes and enables monitoring, e.g., of the glucose metabolism during sepsis.

Existing methods for linking wildlife movement to remotely sensed landscape data generally rely on the application of subjectively derived distance thresholds to represent proximity (i.e., near or far) relative to disturbance, thereby possibly limiting the scope of research questions and insight gained. We develop an alternative method based on semivariogram modeling that quantifies consistency in movement parameters as a function of distance to disturbance features. Our approach uses movement data to identify spatially explicit scales of wildlife response to linear features. We illustrate the benefit of movement-driven approaches for generating hypotheses about wildlife movement with grizzly bear (Ursus arctos) movement data. We concentrate specifically on building hypotheses to explain how seasonal mortality is linked to near road movements. The movement-driven method demonstrated consistency in step length (i.e., spatial scales of response) ranging from 35m–90m from roads, depending on age, sex, and season. Given this pattern, our data suggest a minimum vegetation buffer of 90m to serve as screening cover along roadsides to improve survival in this ecosystem. More broadly, our generalizable method can identify definitive spatial scales of response around human disturbance features in any wildlife system, thereby providing managers with movement-driven insight to reduce impacts on wildlife in multi-use landscapes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUrsus arctos 3aanthropogenic activities 3aecosystems 3aglobal positioning systems 3alandscapes 3amanagers 3amodels 3amortality 3anatural resources conservation 3aremote sensing 3aroads 3aroadsides 3ascreening 3atelemetry 3awildlife 3aAlberta 0aWildlife movement 0aDisturbance 0aSpatial autocorrelation 0aZone of influence 0aGrizzly bear 0aRoads1 aNelson, Trisalyn1 aStenhouse, Gordon1 aDarimont, Chris0 tBiological conservation.g2016 Mar., v. 195 p.24-32dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl44607x0006-32077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2015.12.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02321naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002100144245008300165300001600248520088500264592002801149650002501177650001401202650001001216650001301226650001501239650000901254650001401263650001201277650001101289650002001300650002101320650002101341650001401362650001401376650001701390650002501407650000901432650001401441653000901455653001201464653001401476653001701490700002501507700002201532700002201554773013901576856007901715852000901794655001201803IND60480898320221119131044.0210813e20151201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048089832DNAL7 a10.1515/bvip-2015-00832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOgnik, Katarzyna10aRedox status in the blood of ewes in the perinatal period and during lactation  ap. 557-562.  aThe aim of the study was to determine the effect of the perinatal period on redox status indicators in the blood of ewes before and after lambing and during lactation.

Blood for testing of redox parameters was collected seven times: before pregnancy, 1.5 months and 24 h before lambing, 2 and 24 h after lambing, and in the fourth and eighth weeks of lactation. The following blood indices were determined by spectrophotometry: lipid peroxides, malondialdehyde, superoxide dismutase, catalase, plasma total antioxidant capacity, uric acid, urea, bilirubin, and creatinine. The tests showed that during the perinatal period reactions are generated which lead to oxidative stress.

Splicing is catalyzed by the spliceosome, a multidalton RNA–protein complex, through two successive transesterifications to yield mature mRNAs. In Arabidopsis, more than 61% of all transcripts from intron-containing genes are alternatively spliced, thereby resulting in transcriptome and subsequent proteome diversities for cellular processes. Moreover, it is estimated that more alternative splicing (AS) events induced by adverse stimuli occur to confer stress tolerance. Recently, increasing AS variants encoding normal or novel proteins, or degraded by nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) and their corresponding splicing factors or regulators acting at the posttranscriptional level have been functionally characterized. This review comprehensively summarizes and highlights the advances in our understanding of the biological functions and underlying mechanisms of AS events and their regulators in Arabidopsis and provides prospects for further research on AS in crops.  aThis work was supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China [31700274].  aPublisher supplied data  a31700274 3aArabidopsis 3abehavior 3aproteome 3aspliceosomes 3astress tolerance 3atranscriptome 0aAlternative splicing 0agene expression 0agrowth and development 0aposttranscriptional regulation 0aspliceosome1 aTang, Ziwei1 aLiu, Fuxia1 aMao, Feng1 aYujuan, Gu1 aWang, Zhijuan1 aZhao, Xiangxiang0 tPlant signaling & behavior.g2021 July 03, v. 16, no. 7 p.1917170-dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2184x1559-23247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15592324.2021.19171703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03316naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245008300169300001400252520181500266592002802081650002502109650002402134650001002158650001302168650002002181650001102201650002502212650001702237650002002254650001502274650001202289650001002301650002502311650001302336650001102349650001702360650001802377650001502395651001702410653001802427653002802445653002102473653001302494653001702507700001902524700001602543700001602559773010302575856008702678852000902765655001202774IND60564599120221117065310.0190401e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056459912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jtherbio.2017.03.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCombrink, L.10aNest temperature fluctuations in a cavity nester, the southern ground-hornbill  ap. 21-26.  aSouthern ground-hornbills Bucorvus leadbeateri inhabit savanna and bushveld regions of South Africa. They nest in the austral summer, which coincides with the wet season and hottest daytime temperatures in the region. They are secondary cavity nesters and typically nest in large cavities in trees, cliffs and earth banks, but readily use artificial nest boxes. Southern ground-hornbills are listed as Endangered in South Africa, with reintroductions into suitable areas highlighted as a viable conservation intervention for the species. Nest microclimate, and the possible implications this may have for the breeding biology of southern ground-hornbills, have never been investigated. We used temperature dataloggers to record nest cavity temperature and ambient temperature for one artificial and 11 natural southern ground-hornbill tree cavity nests combined, spanning two breeding seasons. Mean hourly nest temperature, as well as mean minimum and mean maximum nest temperature, differed significantly between southern ground-hornbill nests in both breeding seasons. Mean nest temperature also differed significantly from mean ambient temperature for both seasons. Natural nest cavities provided a buffer against the ambient temperature fluctuations. The artificial nest provided little insulation against temperature extremes, being warmer and cooler than the maximum and minimum local ambient temperatures, respectively. Nest cavity temperature was not found to have an influence on the breeding success of the southern ground-hornbill groups investigated in this study. These results have potentially important implications for southern ground-hornbill conservation and artificial nest design, as they suggest that the birds can tolerate greater nest cavity temperature extremes than previously thought.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBucorvus leadbeateri 3aambient temperature 3abirds 3abreeding 3abreeding season 3acliffs 3ainsulating materials 3amicroclimate 3amicroprocessors 3anest boxes 3anesting 3anests 3areproductive success 3asavannas 3asummer 3athermometers 3atree cavities 3awet season 3aSouth Africa 0aCavity nester 0aTemperature fluctuation 0aNest temperature 0aHornbill 0aConservation1 aCombrink, H.J.1 aBotha, A.J.1 aDowns, C.T.0 tJournal of thermal biology.g2017 May, v. 66 p.21-26dElsevier LtdwJournal:12493x0306-45657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jtherbio.2017.03.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02385naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245011200166300001500278520104200293592002801335650001101363650001701374650001901391650001601410650001101426650002201437650001401459650002901473650001701502650002801519650000901547653002001556653002201576653001301598653003001611653002401641653002001665653002801685773014701713856008201860852000901942655001201951IND60793965120221120223547.0220929e202212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079396512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.esd.2022.09.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShah, Kalim U.10aPotential clean energy transition pathways in the U.S. Virgin Islands using carbon sensitive policy options  ap. 89-103.  aThis study uses the LEAP–OSeMOSYS modeling tool to examine exploratory decarbonization scenarios in the U. S Virgin Islands (USVI). The method combines quantitative modeling of data gathered from utilities and power generators with qualitative information gathered through engagement with experts and diverse business and civil society stakeholder. The results show the effects of two utility scale energy systems - on the islands of St Thomas /St John and St Croix - and future optimized capacity addition with solar, liquefied petroleum gas and wind, whereby renewable energy targets can be achieved over time. Results are also modelled for electric vehicle deployment over time, on the islands. The models take into consideration the effects of extreme weather event impacts on electricity demand; and electric vehicles deployment on the grid, where grid destabilization is a potential risk. These findings can serve as inputs for updating comprehensive island energy strategies in the USVI to meet carbon emissions reduction goals.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3aclean energy 3aclimate change 3aelectricity 3aenergy 3aissues and policy 3apetroleum 3arenewable energy sources 3astakeholders 3asustainable development 3awind 0aEnergy planning 0aScenario analysis 0aOSeMOSYS 0aU.S. Overseas Territories 0aU.S. Virgin Islands 0adecarbonization 0aclean energy transition0 tEnergy for sustainable development.g2022 Dec., v. 71 p.89-103dElsevier Inc.aInternational Energy InitiativewJournal:12424x0973-08267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.esd.2022.09.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03327naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002700143245012600170520173400296536010202030592002802132650001502160650001602175650001702191650001702208650002502225650001102250650001702261650002202278650002502300650001602325650002502341650001402366650001702380653000802397653001502405653000902420653001302429653002602442700002502468700002202493700002702515700002602542700002802568700002402596773011402620856007802734852000902812655001202821IND60770242420221121103849.0220314e20220214xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077024242DNAL7 a10.3897/BDJ.10.e727682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGaite, Paul Lorenzo A.14aThe first complete mitochondrial genome sequence of Cynopterus brachyotis (Chiroptera, Pteropodidae) from the Philippines  aThe technical limitations of capillary sequencing in providing insights on phylogeny have been greatly aided in recent years by the implementation of next generation sequencing platforms which can generate whole mitochondrial genome (mitogenome) sequences. In this study, enriched mitochondrial DNA of Cynopterus brachyotis from Mindanao, Philippines was sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq platform. A total of 653,967 clean paired-end reads was assembled using a MIRA-MITObim pipeline, resulting in a consensus mitogenome sequence length of 17,382 bases and a GC content of 41.48%, which is consistent with other published mitogenomes in fruit bats. The assembled C. brachyotis mitogenome was annotated using the MITOS online server and was able to resolve all mitochondrial genes, except for one transfer RNA gene (trnT) which may be further resolved by additional capillary sequencing of the region. Sequence analysis showed that the Philippine C. brachyotis is only 90%-91% homologous with other Cynopterus spp., based on its full mitogenome sequence. Phylogenetic analysis of fruit bat mitogenomes, deposited in online repositories, revealed that the Philippine C. brachyotis in this study has diverged from Asian Cynopterus, namely Cynopterus brachyotis and Cynopterus sphinx from other parts of Asia (100% bootstrap support) with the latter two forming a separate clade. This divergence at the species level was consistent with phylogentic inference using cytochrome oxidase 1 (CO1) and cytochrome B (cytb) gene markers. Our results strengthen the previously reported hypothesis that the Cynopteruscf.brachyotis in the Philippines is distinct from its Asian counterparts and should be, therefore, treated as a new species.  aDepartment of Science and Technology (DOST) - Philippines, University of the Philippines Mindanao  aPublisher supplied data 3aCynopterus 3aPhilippines 3abiodiversity 3acytochrome b 3acytochrome-c oxidase 3afruits 3amitochondria 3amitochondrial DNA 3amitochondrial genome 3anew species 3anucleotide sequences 3aphylogeny 3atransfer RNA 0aNGS 0amitogenome 0abats 0ataxonomy 0aphylogenetic analysis1 aAala, Jr., Wilson F.1 aBacus, Michael G.1 aLabrador, Christian C.1 aNumeron, April Mae M.1 aGamalo, Lief Erikson D.1 aMurao, Lyre Anni E.0 tBiodiversity data journal.g2022 Feb. 14, v. 10 p.e72768-dPensoft PublisherswJournal:21364x1314-28287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3897/BDJ.10.e727683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03011naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245016400175300001600339520117300355592002801528650002101556650002801577650001801605650002601623650002501649650002801674650001101702650003901713650002001752650001701772650001101789650001501800650001701815650001401832651001501846653002701861653002501888653001701913653001501930653002501945653001901970700001901989700006002008700006002068700006502128700002302193700002002216700002302236773010402259856008502363852000902448655001202457IND60609336820221121215058.0190628e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060933682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2018.07.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarkabayeva, Akbayan10aIncreased prevalence of essential hypertension in areas previously exposed to fallout due to nuclear weapons testing at the Semipalatinsk Test Site, Kazakhstan  ap. 129-135.  aThis study examines the association between environmental radiation exposure and essential hypertension in a series of investigated geographical districts adjacent to the Semipalatinsk nuclear test site in Kazakhstan. The sample consists of 2000 volunteers participants in screening examinations in three administrative districts close to the nuclear test site, which was carried out as part of the Government Programs on Environmental Health Hazard. The cross-sectional study compares prevalence ratios in a population sample with long-term exposure in the low and intermediate dose range. Age-adjusted odds ratios for hypertension were found significantly increased with higher exposure groups. After accounting for main cardiovascular risk factors into the model and stratifying by gender, the prevalence odds ratios for radiation remained significantly increased, with a significant dose-response effect observed for some but not all subgroups. The results support existing evidence of cardiovascular health effects of radiation exposure and of persisting environmental health issues that require attention in both epidemiological surveys and healthcare provision.  aPublisher supplied data 3achronic exposure 3across-sectional studies 3adose response 3aenvironmental hazards 3aenvironmental health 3aepidemiological studies 3agender 3agovernmental programs and projects 3ahealth services 3ahypertension 3amodels 3aodds ratio 3arisk factors 3ascreening 3aKazakhstan 0aCardiovascular disease 0aEnvironmental health 0aHypertension 0aKazakhstan 0aNuclear test fallout 0aRadiation risk1 aBauer, Susanne1 aPivina, Lyudmila1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8035-48661 aBjørklund, Geir1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2632-39351 aChirumbolo, Salvatore1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1789-83071 aKerimkulova, Aiman1 aSemenova, Yulia1 aBelikhina, Tatyana0 tEnvironmental research.g2018 Nov., v. 167 p.129-135dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12442x0013-93517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2018.07.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04217naa a2200709 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245018000162300001600342520211300358592002802471650002802499650002502527650001702552650002702569650001602596650001302612650002102625650001002646650003002656650001602686650004202702650002802744650001902772650003202791650001402823650002602837650001002863650002002873650000902893650001102902650002002913650002202933650001502955650001402970650002502984650002503009650001103034653001103045653001103056653003103067653001903098700001603117700001303133700001603146700001503162700001503177700001803192700001803210700001303228700001603241700001703257700001403274773011603288856008203404852000903486655001203495IND60613457720221119150520.0181015e20181205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061345772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jep.2018.09.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Jing10aSagittaria sagittifolia polysaccharide protects against isoniazid- and rifampicin-induced hepatic injury via activation of nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 signaling in mice  ap. 237-245.  aThe Sagittaria sagittifolia L. polysaccharide (SSP) is a purified form of a homogeneous polysaccharide isolated from the root tubers of S. sagittifolia, which has been used as a protectant against hepatotoxicity induced by coadministration of isoniazid and rifampicin. However, the protective effect of SSP against isoniazid- and rifampicin-induced liver injury has never been studied.In this study, the hepatoprotective effect of SSP and its underlying mechanism were investigated in mice with isoniazid- and rifampicin-induced liver injury.Liver injury was induced in mice by intragastric administration of isoniazid and rifampicin, and the mice were divided into the following six groups: standard control (administration of saline by gavage), model (intragastric administration of isoniazid and rifampicin at 100 mg/kg/day each), positive control (100 mg/kg/day silymarin by gavage 4 h after isoniazid and rifampicin administration), and SSP-treated (200, 400, or 800 mg/kg/day SSP by gavage after isoniazid and rifampicin administration). Subsequently, blood and liver samples were collected from all the animals and were assessed.SSP significantly alleviated the liver injury, as evidenced by decreased activities of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and lactate dehydrogenase in the serum and a decreased level of malondialdehyde in the liver, as well as by an increased level of glutathione and increased activities of superoxide dismutase and catalase in the liver. SSP also effectively reduced the pathological tissue damage. The gene and protein expression of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2E1 and CYP3A4 was inhibited by SSP. The gene and protein expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2), glutamate-cysteine ligase, and heme oxygenase-1 were induced by SSP, whereas that of Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 was inhibited.SSP exerts a protective effect against isoniazid- and rifampicin-induced liver injury in mice. The underlying mechanisms may involve activation of NRF2 and its target antioxidant enzymes and inhibition of the expression of CYPs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSagittaria sagittifolia 3aalanine transaminase 3aantioxidants 3aaspartate transaminase 3ablood serum 3acatalase 3acytochrome P-450 3agenes 3aglutamate-cysteine ligase 3aglutathione 3aheme oxygenase (biliverdin-producing) 3ahepatoprotective effect 3ahepatotoxicity 3aintragastric administration 3aisoniazid 3alactate dehydrogenase 3aliver 3amalondialdehyde 3amice 3amodels 3apolysaccharides 3aprotein synthesis 3arifampicin 3asilymarin 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atraditional medicine 3atubers 0aCYP2E1 0aCYP3A4 0aHepatoprotective mechanism 0aNRF2 signaling1 aLuo, Weizao1 aLi, Bing1 aLv, Junping1 aKe, Xiuhui1 aGe, Dongyu1 aDong, Ruijuan1 aWang, Chunguo1 aHan, Yue1 aZhang, Cong1 aYu, Haichuan1 aLiao, Yan0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2018 Dec. 05, v. 227 p.237-245dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl30651x0378-87417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2018.09.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02714naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245009100177300001800268520128000286536015601566592002801722596004101750650001301791650000901804650002301813650001601836650001001852650001901862650000901881651001001890653001301900653002001913653003001933653001201963653003501975653001402010700001802024700001802042773012602060856008502186852000902271655001202280IND60748375320221121100404.0210827e20211003xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074837532DNAL7 a10.1080/15440478.2019.16911172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEvangeline, Sheela Y.10aLong-Term Performance of Rural Roads Reinforced with Coir Geotextile – A Field Study  ap. 1419-1436.  aIndia has one of the largest road networks in the world, aggregating to about 56 lakh km at present. At sites with inadequate CBR, problems of excessive rutting are very common. In order to overcome this ground improvement techniques such as inclusion of coir geotextile is a good option. Coir geotextiles are manufactured with coir fibers, extracted from the husk of coconut, and are more durable than other natural fibers due to high lignin content. Construction of pavements strengthened with coir geotextiles makes it cost-effective and eco-friendly. In this paper, the results of the performance study conducted on five coir geotextile reinforced and unreinforced roads in different parts of Kerala, after three to 6 years of construction are reported. Coir geotextile had been placed in between subgrade and sub base. The performance was evaluated by conducting Benkelman Beam Deflection (BBD), Field CBR and Dynamic Cone Penetration (DCP) test on reinforced and unreinforced roads. A reduction in characteristic deflection thereby decrease in bituminous Macadam overlay, decrease in DCP Index and improvement in in-situ CBR values ranging from 22% to 178% were obtained for roads on all types of soil. A correlation was also developed between field CBR and field DCPI.  aThe financial support provided by Coir Board, Government of India for conducting the experimental investigation is greatly acknowledged by the authors.  aPublisher supplied data  aNo. CCRI/RES/CGT- CET/3/16/2011/0863 3acoconuts 3acoir 3acost effectiveness 3ageotextiles 3ahulls 3alignin content 3asoil 3aIndia 0aSubgrade 0acoir geotextile 0acharacteristic deflection 0aoverlay 0adynamic cone penetration index 0afield CBR1 aSayida, M.

We aimed to compare the recruitment and distribution patterns of adults and seedlings of an exotic invasive plant, glossy buckthorn (Frangula alnus), with four co-occurring native shrub species within a heterogeneous Wisconsin wetland. Detailed vegetation survey data were analyzed for spatial and compositional patterns of shrub distributions. In adult plant frequency and cover, buckthorn was not significantly different from the native winterberry. However, the number of glossy buckthorn seedlings exceeded by more than seven times the combined number of seedlings of the four native species. Sample units containing buckthorn adults were also much more likely to contain seedlings than for native shrubs. However, native seedlings were not more likely to occur at sites lacking adults, suggesting no greater dependence on recruitment away from adults in native species. Buckthorn, winterberry, poison sumac, and dogwood all showed preference for sites with higher tree densities and lower predominance of obligate wetland species in an ordination of 114 species. Glossy buckthorn adults and seedlings and winterberry seedlings were more widely distributed across seven community types than adults and seedlings of the other native species, suggesting broad tolerance to the conditions in different community types. High recruitment is the key factor that may allow glossy buckthorn to overcome community resistance and spread.  aPublisher supplied data 3asampling 3ashrubs 3aseedlings 3aFrangula alnus 3atrees 3aindigenous species 3ainvasive species 3aadults 0arecruitment1 aMeyer, Gretchen A.1 aReinartz, James A.1 aYoung, Erica B.0 tPlant ecology.g2012 Sept., v. 213, no. 9 p.1425-1436dSpringer-Verlagx1385-02377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11258-012-0101-x  aDNAL 7aarticle02645naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245011700168300001600285520124500301592002801546650001501574650002501589650002001614650002701634650001401661650001501675650001101690650001701701650001101718650001501729650001101744650001301755650001501768653002301783653002101806653001201827653002001839653002401859700002501883700002101908700002001929700001601949773010401965856008502069852000902154655001202163IND60609336920221121215028.0190628e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060933692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2018.07.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRuntti, Hanna10aHow to tackle the stringent sulfate removal requirements in mine water treatment—A review of potential methods  ap. 207-222.  aSulfate (SO42-) is a ubiquitous anion in natural waters. It is not considered toxic, but it may be detrimental to freshwater species at elevated concentrations. Mining activities are one significant source of anthropogenic sulfate into natural waters, mainly due to the exposure of sulfide mineral ores to weathering. There are several strategies for mitigating sulfate release, starting from preventing sulfate formation in the first place and ending at several end-of-pipe treatment options. Currently, the most widely used sulfate-removal process is precipitation as gypsum (CaSO4·2H2O). However, the lowest reachable concentration is theoretically 1500 mg L−1 SO42- due to gypsum's solubility. At the same time, several mines worldwide have significantly more stringent sulfate discharge limits. The purpose of this review is to examine the process options to reach low sulfate levels (< 1500 mg L−1) in mine effluents. Examples of such processes include alternative chemical precipitation methods, membrane technology, biological treatment, ion exchange, and adsorption. In addition, aqueous chemistry and current effluent standards concerning sulfate together with concentrate treatment and sulfur recovery are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3abiological treatment 3acalcium sulfate 3achemical precipitation 3aeffluents 3afreshwater 3agypsum 3aion exchange 3amining 3asolubility 3asulfur 3atoxicity 3aweathering 0aAcid mine drainage 0aDischarge limits 0aSulfate 0aSulfur recovery 0aWater contamination1 aTolonen, Emma-Tuulia1 aTuomikoski, Sari1 aLuukkonen, Tero1 aLassi, Ulla0 tEnvironmental research.g2018 Nov., v. 167 p.207-222dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12442x0013-93517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2018.07.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02552naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245012200167300001600289506010400305506007600409520106500485592002801550506003701578650001901615650002301634650001101657650002901668650002101697650002801718650002401746653003601770653000701806653001801813653003101831653001501862653003201877700001501909773011501924856008202039852000902121655001202130IND60793965320221207133318.0221004e202212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079396532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.esd.2022.09.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHerman, Kyle S.10aHow collaboration with G7 countries drives environmental technology innovation in ten Newly Industrializing Countries  ap. 176-185.  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe development and deployment of environmental technologies (ETs) is critical to avert further environmental destruction, to significantly reduce emissions and to halt climate change. Innovation in ETs is particularly pertinent in newly industrializing countries (NICs), since they will soon overtake developed countries in terms of aggregate greenhouse gas emissions, but also have the economic strength required to scale up ETs rapidly. Even though NICs now supply a substantial share of low-carbon technologies, multilateral climate change policies continue to focus narrowly on technology transfer rather than collaboration and co-invention. In addition, G7 countries have vocalized their intention to collaborate with developing countries to innovate and diffuse ETs, suggesting that collaboration can be a key driver of developing country innovations. Against this background, we conduct an empirical analysis of ten NICs from 1990 to 2017 and demonstrate that technological collaboration with G7 countries significantly increases ET innovation in NICs.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aclimate change 3aempirical research 3aenergy 3aenvironmental technology 3agreenhouse gases 3asustainable development 3atechnology transfer 0aNewly Industrializing Countries 0aG7 0aCollaboration 0aEnvironmental technologies 0aInnovation 0aClean Development Mechanism1 aXiang, Jun0 tEnergy for sustainable development.g2022 Dec., v. 71 p.176-185dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12424x0973-08267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.esd.2022.09.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03144naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002700144245014300171300002000314500001900334520163100353592002801984650001602012650001202028650001902040650001902059650001102078650002602089650001302115653004802128653004102176653001202217653001702229653003202246700002202278700006002300700007002360700006302430773014202493856007802635852000902713655001202722IND60735371320210831000000.0210423e20210412xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073537132DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.1c002272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrito-Pereira, Ricardo10aFluorinated Polymer Membranes as Advanced Substrates for Portable Analytical Systems and Their Proof of Concept for Colorimetric Bioassays  ap. 18065-18076.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPortable analytical systems are increasingly required for clinical analysis or environmental monitoring, among others, being materials with tailored physicochemical properties among the main needs for successful functional implementation. This article describes the processing of fluorinated poly(vinylidene-co-trifluorethylene), P(VDF-TrFE), membranes with tailored morphological and physicochemical properties to be used as microfluidic substrates for portable analytical systems, commonly called point-of-care systems in the medical field. The morphology of the developed membranes includes spherulitic, porous, randomly oriented, and oriented fibers. Furthermore, the processed hydrophobic P(VDF-TrFE) membranes were post-treated by oxygen plasma to make them superhydrophilic. The influence of morphology and plasma treatment on the physicochemical properties and capillary flow rates was evaluated. Microfluidic systems were then designed and printed by wax printing for the colorimetric quantification of glucose. The systems comprise eight reaction chambers, each glucose concentration (25, 50, 75, and 100 mg dL–¹) being measured in two reaction chambers separately and at the same time. The results demonstrate the suitability of the developed microfluidic substrates based on their tailorable morphology, improved capillary flow rate, wax print quality, homogeneous generation of colorimetric reaction, and excellent mechanical properties. Finally, the possibility of being reused, along with their electroactive properties, can lead to a new generation of microfluidic substrates based on fluorinated membranes.  aPublisher supplied data 3acolorimetry 3aglucose 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3aoxygen 3apoint-of-care systems 3apolymers 0amicrofluidic paper-based analytical devices 0apoly(vinylidene-co-trifluorethylene) 0apolymer 0amicrofluidic 0aportable analytical systems1 aMacedo, André S.1 aTubio, Carmen R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6988-82421 aLanceros-Méndez, Senentxu1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6791-76201 aCardoso, Vanessa F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3039-55200 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2021 Apr. 12, v. 13, no. 15 p.18065-18076dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.1c002273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02714naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002100155245007000176300001400246520129800260592002801558650002601586650001301612650001901625650002601644650002301670650001001693650001001703650003701713650001401750650001301764650002301777653002501800653002401825653001401849653002901863653001801892700002501910700002001935700002101955700001901976700002201995773012802017856009002145852000902235655001202244IND60549582620221118223433.0190318e20161205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054958262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2016.08.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStreekstra, Hugo10aFungal strains and the development of tolerance against natamycin  ap. 15-22.  aAntimicrobial resistance is a relevant theme with respect to both antibacterial and antifungal compounds. In this study we address the possible development of tolerance against the antifungal food preservative natamycin. A selection of 20 fungal species, originating from a medical as well as a food product context, was subjected to increasing concentrations of natamycin for prolonged time, a procedure designated as “training”. The range of Minimum Inhibitory Concentrations (M.I.C.) before (1.8–19.2μM) and after (1.8–19.8μM) training did not change significantly, but natamycin-exposure caused an increase of M.I.C. in 13 out of 20 tested strains. The average M.I.C. increased from 6.1 to 8.6μM and 4 strains showed a >2-fold increase of tolerance after training. One strain (of Aspergillus ochraceus) also showed increased tolerance to amphotericin B and nystatin. However, two Fusarium strains showed similar or even decreased tolerance for these other polyene antifungals.The work reported here shows that a continuous and prolonged increasing selection pressure induced natamycin tolerance in individual strains. This implies that such a selection pressure should be avoided in the technical application of natamycin to ensure its continued safe use as a food preservative.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus ochraceus 3aFusarium 3aamphotericin B 3aantibiotic resistance 3afood preservatives 3afoods 3afungi 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3anatamycin 3anystatin 3aselection pressure 0aAntifungal compounds 0aPolyene antibiotics 0aNatamycin 0aAntimicrobial resistance 0aFood additive1 aVerkennis, Alex E.E.1 aJacobs, Robbert1 aDekker, Angelina1 aStark, Jacques1 aDijksterhuis, Jan0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2016 Dec. 05, v. 238 p.15-22dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl35565x0168-16057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2016.08.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03213naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245011100165300001800276520186900294592002802163650001102191650001402202650000902216650001202225650002702237650002402264650002102288650001002309650003302319650001802352650001502370650002302385650001802408700002302426700002202449700005602471700002002527700001902547773012302566856008102689852000902770655001202779IND60630447020221118111624.0190208e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063044702DNAL7 a10.1134/S10642293181201282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmagin, A. V.10aDependence of the Osmotic Pressure and Electrical Conductivity of Soil Solutions on the Soil Water Content  ap. 1462-1473.  aThe osmotic pressure and electrical conductivity were determined with the use of instrumental methods (centrifuging, conductometry, and cryoscopy) in equilibrium soil solutions as the functions of moisture (the mass ratio between solid and liquid phases) for the soils of different geneses and textures. These functions proved to have a nonlinear character with one extremum. A theoretical substantiation to this phenomenon is suggested. It is based on the concept of competing interphase interactions in soil and develops the classical ideas by A.A. Rode. Upon the low soil water content, surface (molecular and ion-electrostatic) forces of the solid phase bind water molecules and prevent them from hydrating ions and dissolving electrolyte salts in the soil solution; as a result, electrical conductivity and osmotic pressure values approach zero in this case. With an increase in the water content, water molecules escape gradually from the energy field of surface forces, and their activity (chemical potential) and dissolving capacity also increase. This results in the expected growth of the electrical conductivity and osmotic pressure of the equilibrium solution extracted from the soil. The maximum values of the studied parameters are observed at the water content approximately equal to the maximum molecular water capacity (or to the boundary zone, within which capillary gravitational forces influencing the soil liquid phase become prevailing over the surface interphase interaction forces). The further increase in the soil water content lowers the electrical conductivity and osmotic pressure of equilibrium solution because of dilution of the fixed mass of electrolyte salts. For quantitative description of the revealed functional dependence, we suggest an empirical mathematical model in the form of modified equation of lognormal distribution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy 3aequations 3aions 3aliquids 3alognormal distribution 3amathematical models 3aosmotic pressure 3asalts 3asoil electrical conductivity 3asoil solution 3asoil water 3asoil water content 3awater content1 aSadovnikova, N.

While fragment size is considered the main factor acting on species diversity for most taxa, it is less clear how it affects amphibian diversity. A possible reason is that the scale at which previous studies were conducted was too small (only few forest fragments and/or a small range of fragment sizes considered) and/or the sampling method was not the most optimal one. We investigate whether amphibian diversity is affected by patch size in the largest study (in terms of number of fragments and range of fragment sizes) ever conducted in tropical forests. We predicted that larger forest remnants hold higher amphibian diversity compared to smaller patches, and that continuously forest sites were more diverse than forest fragments. We used the visual encounter survey method to collect data from 24 sites (21 forest fragments between 1.9 and 619ha and three sites within a large continuous forest remnant) located in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, a highly threatened biodiversity hotspot. We recorded a total of 2839 individuals from 50 species. In line with our predictions, larger fragments had more species, more integer communities and a larger diversity of reproductive modes than smaller ones. In addition, we found higher values for all diversity measures in continuous forest sites compared to fragments. These results indicate that continuous forests are irreplaceable for amphibian conservation, but also show that large forest fragments outside these areas are important for sustaining amphibian diversity. Our study provides robust empirical evidence for the importance of fragment size for amphibian persistence in tropical fragmented landscapes and highlights the need for an adequate sampling design and method that enable the detection of a higher number of species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamphibians 3ahabitat fragmentation 3anatural resources conservation 3aprediction 3asampling 3aspecies diversity 3asurveys 3atropical forests 0aAtlantic forest remnants 0aCommunity composition 0aFrogs 0aSpecies–area relationship 0aSpecies turnover 0aForest specialist species1 aVieira, Marcus Vinícius1 aRocha, Carlos Frederico Duarte1 aMetzger, Jean Paul1 aDe Coster, Greet0 tBiological conservation.g2016 Mar., v. 195 p.89-96dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl44607x0006-32077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2015.12.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02445naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005300144245011100197300002000308500001900328520104200347592002801389650002401417650001501441650002201456650001301478653002401491653001301515653001801528653003201546653004101578700005201619700001701671700001801688700001901706700005801725700002301783773014201806856007801948852000902026655001202035IND60735371520221119205429.0210423e20210409xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073537152DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.1c002682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQiao, Jie1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9571-014910aHighly In-Plane Anisotropic Two-Dimensional Ternary Ta₂NiSe₅ for Polarization-Sensitive Photodetectors  ap. 17948-17956.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIntriguing anisotropic electrical and optoelectrical properties in two-dimensional (2D) materials are currently gaining increasing interest both for fundamental research and emerging optoelectronic devices. Identifying promising new 2D materials with low-symmetry structures will be rewarding in the development of polarization-integrated nanodevices. In this work, the anisotropic electron transport and optoelectrical properties of multilayer 2D ternary Ta₂NiSe₅ were systematically researched. The polarization-sensitive Ta₂NiSe₅ photodetector shows a linearly anisotropy ratio of ≈3.24 with 1064 nm illumination. The multilayer Ta₂NiSe₅-based field-effective transistors exhibit an excellent field-effective mobility of 161.25 cm²·V–¹·s–¹ along the a axis (armchair direction) as well as a great current saturation characteristic at room temperature. These results will promote a better understanding of the optoelectrical properties and applications in new categories of the in-plane anisotropic 2D materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3aanisotropy 3aelectron transfer 3alighting 0ain-plane anisotropy 0aTa2NiSe5 0aphotodetector 0afield-effective transistors 0apolarization-sensitive photodetector1 aFeng, Fu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3725-06901 aWang, Ziming1 aShen, Mengyan1 aZhang, Guoping1 aYuan, Xiaocong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2605-90031 aSomekh, Michael G.0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2021 Apr. 09, v. 13, no. 15 p.17948-17956dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.1c002683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03223naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245012000169300001800289500001500307520177600322592002802098650001402126650001902140650000902159650001402168650002002182650001002202650002102212650001002233650001302243650001002256650001102266650001002277650000902287650001202296650001102308651001202319651001002331651001102341651001402352700002002366700001902386700002202405700002402427700002102451700002102472773011002493856008102603852000902684655001202693IND60488046320221122194411.0160219e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048804632DNAL7 a10.1007/s00436-015-4860-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDiakou, Anastasia10aFirst evidence of the European wildcat (Felis silvestris silvestris) as definitive host of Angiostrongylus chabaudi  ap. 1235-1244.  a2019-12-06  aAngiostrongylus chabaudi (Strongylida, Angiostrongylidae) is a parasitic nematode described for the first time last century from the pulmonary arteries of six European wildcats (Felis silvestris silvestris) in central Italy. Since then, this parasite remained practically unknown until recently, when immature A. chabaudi have been reported from one wildcat in Germany and two domestic cats (Felis silvestris catus) in Italy. The present report describes the first record of A. chabaudi in Greece and, most importantly, the first known case of patent infection by A. chabaudi. The necropsy of a road-killed F. s. silvestris found near the lake Kerkini, in the municipality of Serres (Macedonia, Greece), revealed the presence of nematodes of both sexes in the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery of the heart. All parasites were mature adults and numerous eggs were present in the uteruses of females. The morphological characteristics of the parasites were consistent with those of A. chabaudi. Moreover, Angiostrongylus-like first stage larvae (L1) were present in the faeces of the animal that was negative for any other cardio-pulmonary parasite. Genetic examination of adult parasites and L1 confirmed the morphological identification as A. chabaudi. Histopathological examination of the lungs showed severe, multifocal to coalescing, chronic, interstitial granulomatous pneumonia due to the presence of adult parasites, larvae and eggs. These findings demonstrate for the first unequivocal time that this nematode reproduces in the European wildcat which should be ultimately considered a definitive host of A. chabaudi. Finally, the L1 of A. chabaudi are described here for the first time, opening new prospects for further studies on this neglected parasite.  aPublisher supplied data 3aparasites 3ahistopathology 3acats 3apneumonia 3aAngiostrongylus 3afeces 3apulmonary artery 3aFelis 3anecropsy 3alungs 3alarvae 3aheart 3aeggs 3afemales 3aadults 3aGermany 3aItaly 3aGreece 0aMacedonia1 aPsalla, Dimitra1 aMigli, Despina1 aDi Cesare, Angela1 aYoulatos, Dionisios1 aMarcer, Federica1 aTraversa, Donato0 tParasitology research.g2016 Mar., v. 115, no. 3 p.1235-1244dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0932-01137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-015-4860-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03249naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006300150245009100213300001400304520167900318592002801997650001502025650002302040650001202063650001902075650002002094650001502114650003502129650001402164650001302178650001202191650001002203650001502213650001202228651001802240651001902258653003102277653001302308653001702321653001502338653001902353653002102372700001702393700002402410700003002434700002302464700001802487773012002505856008502625852000902710655001202719IND60605648120221121035524.0190215e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060564812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocon.2015.12.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarrows, Cameron W.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9318-746210aUsing citizen scientists to assess climate change shifts in desert reptile communities  ap. 82-88.  aIdentifying effects of climate change, as well as other drivers of population shifts, across multiple taxa and broad spatial and temporal scales is challenging. Nevertheless these are the data that may be required to catalyze and focus management actions, separating the effects of weather from climate, and climate from a multitude of other stressors. An impediment to initiating research that fulfill these criteria is ensuring financial and institutional sustainability for an effort that necessarily could span decades. Citizen scientists have been put forth as a means for providing that sustainability, but is quality compromised when volunteers are collecting data? Here we evaluate that question for research focused on assessing the effect of environmental change across the transition between the Mojave and Sonoran Desert ecoregions of North America. While our research includes surveys for multiple taxa, here our focus is on measuring the utility of using citizen scientists for surveying diurnal reptiles. We compared data collected by two trained biologists to citizen science teams supervised by one or more biologists on the same plots. We also re-surveyed plots to determine if separate citizen science teams yielded similar results. The number of reptile species detected and the number of individuals detected increased significantly with teams of citizen scientists, and multiple sampling of individual plots showed those results to be repeatable. With carefully designed survey protocols and supervision by biologists, citizen scientists can be an important component of achieving sustainability of scientific research, without losing scientific rigor.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiologists 3acitizen scientists 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3adata collection 3aecoregions 3anatural resources conservation 3aprotocols 3areptiles 3asurveys 3ateams 3avolunteers 3aweather 3aNorth America 3aSonoran Desert 0aMojave and Sonoran Deserts 0aReptiles 0aBiodiversity 0aVolunteers 0aSustainability 0aScientific rigor1 aHoines, Josh1 aVamstad, Michael S.1 aMurphy-Mariscal, Michelle1 aLalumiere, Kristen1 aHeintz, James0 tBiological conservation.g2016 Mar., v. 195 p.82-88dElsevier LtdaElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl44607x0006-32077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2015.12.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03216naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245010200172300001600274520175400290592002802044650001902072650001702091650001502108650002602123650001402149650002402163650001302187650001802200650001202218650001802230650003502248650001602283650002502299650001502324650002002339653001802359653002202377653002202399653002202421653004202443653002202485700002602507773010702533856008502640852000902725655001202734IND60605648220221121035537.0190215e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060564822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocon.2015.12.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBouchard, Mathieu10aIs metapopulation size important for the conservation of understory plants and epiphytic lichens?  ap. 187-195.  aFor a given species, reducing the extent, connectivity and health status of source populations will diminish the probability of colonizing suitable habitats. In this study, we evaluated if metapopulation size helped predict species presence in suitable habitats, by using boreal understory plants and epiphytic lichens as case studies. We sampled a network of 792 vegetation plots located across a 240,000-km2 section of pristine boreal forests. Landscape-level species abundance (LLSA), a proxy for metapopulation size, was quantified in a 50km radius surrounding each plot. The effects of local environmental factors and LLSA on species presence were modelled with general linear models (GLMs). Forty-eight vascular plant species and 8 pendulous epiphytic lichens were abundant enough to be considered in the statistical analyses. Habitat variables explained the presence of 30 vascular plants and 4 lichen species to a relatively strong degree (Tjur's R2>0.15). Among these species, 16 vascular plants and 4 lichens were significantly influenced by LLSA, independently of local habitat characteristics. Vascular plant species whose presence was significantly affected by LLSA did not exhibit particular morphological traits or habitat preferences compared with those that were not affected. By contrast, the 4 epiphytic lichen species that were affected by LLSA were all associated with older forests. No species exhibited obvious metapopulation size thresholds below which the probability of species presence in suitable habitats dropped drastically. In terms of conservation, these results suggest that coarse-filter approaches are probably more robust and easy to implement than species-specific threshold approaches in this kind of ecosystem.  aPublisher supplied data 3aboreal forests 3acase studies 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental factors 3aepiphytes 3ahabitat preferences 3ahabitats 3ahealth status 3alichens 3alinear models 3anatural resources conservation 3aprobability 3astatistical analysis 3aunderstory 3avascular plants 0aBoreal forest 0aEpiphytic lichens 0aHabitat abundance 0aHabitat threshold 0aLandscape-level conservation approach 0aUnderstory plants1 aBoudreault, Catherine0 tBiological conservation.g2016 Mar., v. 195 p.187-195dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl44607x0006-32077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2015.12.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04004naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100006700154245011700221300001600338520254600354592002802900650001602928650002102944650001102965650002302976650002002999650001403019650001103033650001903044650001103063650001603074650001103090650001403101650001703115650001803132650001503150650001603165653003203181653001003213653001003223653001003233653003403243653002303277773012403300856008903424852000903513655001203522IND60553763520221120071846.0190410e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055376352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2016.07.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBorzabadi-Farahani, Ali1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3729-234810aEffect of low-level laser irradiation on proliferation of human dental mesenchymal stem cells; a systemic review  ap. 577-582.  aIdentification of factors that enhance the proliferation of human dental mesenchymal stem cells (DMSCs) is vital to facilitate tissue regeneration. The role of low-level laser irradiation (LLLI) on proliferation of human DMSCs has not been well established.To assess the effect of LLLI on proliferation of human DMSCs when applied in-vitro.Electronic search of literature was conducted (2000–2016) on PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases. Search terms included low-level light therapy, low-level laser irradiation, low-level light irradiation, LLLT, humans, adolescent, adult, cells, cultured, periodontal ligament, dental pulp, stem cells, dental pulp stem cells, mesenchymal stem cells, periodontal ligament stem cell, deciduous teeth, cell proliferation, adult stem cells, radiation, and proliferation.The literature search identified 165 studies with 6 being eligible for inclusion; all used diode lasers; 5 studies used InGaAIP diode lasers; 4 used 660nm, and the other two applied 810nm or 980nm wavelength LLLI. The distance between the DMSCs and the laser spot ranged between 0.5mm to 2mm. The time intervals of cell proliferation analysis ranged from 0h to 7days after LLLI. After 660nm LLLI, an increase in the DMSC's proliferation was reported [DMSCs extracted from dental pulp of deciduous teeth (two irradiations, 3J/cm2, 20mW was more effective than 40mW), adult teeth (two irradiations, 0.5 and 1.0J/cm2, 30mW), and from adult periodontal ligament (two irradiations, 1.0J/cm2 was more effective than 0.5J/cm2, 30mW)]. Similarly, an increase in the proliferation of DMSCs extracted from dental pulp of adult teeth was reported after 810nm LLLI (7 irradiations in 7days, 0.1 and 0.2J/cm2, 60mW) or 980nm LLLI (single irradiation, 3J/cm2, 100mW). However, 660nm LLLI in one study did not increase the proliferation of DMSCs (single irradiation, energy densities of 0.05, 0.30, 7, and 42J/cm2, 28mW).There is limited evidence that in-vitro LLLI (660/810/980nm, with energy densities of 0.1-3J/cm2) increases the proliferation of DMSCs. Considering the limited evidence and their method heterogeneity it is difficult to reach a firm conclusion. Further research is necessary to identify the optimal characteristics of the LLLI setting (wave length, energy density, power output, frequency/duration of irradiations, distance between the cells and the laser spot/probe) to increase proliferation of DMSCs, and assess its impact on replicative senescence, as well as determine feasibility of the use in the clinical setting.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadolescents 3aadult stem cells 3aadults 3acell proliferation 3acell senescence 3adatabases 3aenergy 3aenergy density 3ahumans 3airradiation 3alasers 3aligaments 3aphototherapy 3atissue repair 3atooth pulp 3awavelengths 0aLow-level laser irradiation 0a660nm 0a810nm 0a980nm 0aDental mesenchymal stem cells 0aCell proliferation0 tJournal of photochemistry and photobiology.g2016 Sept., v. 162 p.577-582dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6193x1011-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2016.07.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02223naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002900152245011300181300001400294520133000308592002801638653001701666653002001683653001601703700002101719700002001740773009001760856008601850852000901936655001201945IND60596148820221117063909.0180615e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059614882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.wavemoti.2017.07.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChillara, Vamshi Krishna10aRadial modes of laterally stiffened piezoelectric disc transducers for ultrasonic collimated beam generation  ap. 19-27.  aWe numerically investigate the resonance and vibration characteristics of radial modes of laterally stiffened piezoelectric disc transducers. Lateral stiffening is modelled using a spring and vibration characteristics of the piezo-disc are investigated with increasing lateral stiffness. It is found that the resonant frequency response of the radial modes follows an asymptotic behaviour approaching that of a clamped disc with increasing lateral stiffness. The radial mode vibration pattern of the discs is also found to be affected by lateral stiffness. While the vibration pattern of a free disc corresponds to a Bessel function, laterally stiffened discs show edge-effects where they depart from the Bessel-like behaviour. In addition, a fully clamped piezo-disc is found to have an extra side-lobe when compared to a free disc. Ultrasonic beam profiles generated from radial modes of laterally stiffened discs are numerically investigated. It is found that the free piezo-disc generates a Bessel beam that has multiple side-lobes. Increasing the lateral stiffness results in a significant reduction of side-lobes in the beam profile. This technique of generating a collimated beam with side-lobe reduction finds significant applications in imaging through concrete, drilling mud, and other highly attenuating materials.  aPublisher supplied data 0aRadial modes 0aCollimated beam 0aUltrasonics1 aPantea, Cristian1 aSinha, Dipen N.0 tWave motion.g2018 Jan., v. 76 p.19-27dElsevier B.V.wJournal:26775x0165-21257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wavemoti.2017.07.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02092naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002800151245011500179300001400294520072500308592002801033596011401061650001101175650002301186650002601209650001901235650001701254650001401271650001401285650001101299653002101310653002001331653002901351653001401380700002101394700003201415700002101447773012001468856008501588852000901673655001201682IND60626051720221119140755.0181214e20190102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062605172DNAL7 a10.1080/15440478.2017.13790442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRibeiro, Guilherme Luis10aLow-density polyethylene/sugarcane fiber composites from recycled polymer and treated fiber by steam explosion  ap. 13-24.  aLow-density polyethylene (LDPE) has caused serious environmental damages, and it has been a challenge for waste management in large cities.

However, most membranes still face great challenges in water permeability, antifouling property, and even antibiotic ability. Possessing a pathogen-repellent surface is of great significance as it can enable membranes to minimize the presence of active viral pathogens. Herein, we demonstrate a distinct design with a molecular dynamics simulation-guided experiment for the surface domination of antibiotic zwitterionic nanogel membranes. The zwitterionic nanoparticle gel (ZNG)/Cu²⁺/glutaraldehyde (GA) synergy system is first simulated by introducing a ZNG into a preset CuCl₂ brine solution and into a GA ethanol solution, in which the nanogel is observed to initially swell and subsequently shrink with the increase of GA concentration, leading to the membrane surface structure transition. Then, the corresponding experiments are performed under strict conditions, and the results suggest the surface structure transition from nanoparticles to network nanoflowers, which are consistent with the simulated results. The obtained network structure membrane with superhydrophilic and underwater superoleophobic abilities can significantly enhance the water permeability as high as almost 40% with its original rejection rate in comparison with unoptimizable ZNG-PVDF (polyvinylidene difluoride) membranes. Moreover, the obtained membrane achieves additional excellent antibiofouling capacity with the antibiotic efficiency exceeding 99.3%, manifesting remarkable potential for disinfection applications. By comparison, the conventional antibiotic methods generally improve the membrane’s antibiotic property solely but can hardly improve the other properties of the membrane. That is to say, our simulation combined with the experimental strategy significantly improved the zwitterionic membrane property in this work, which provides a new perspective on the design of high-performance functional materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibacterial properties 3aantibiotics 3aantifouling activities 3abrine solutions 3adisinfection 3aethanol 3ahydrophilicity 3amolecular dynamics 3ananoflowers 3ananogels 3apermeability 3awastewater 3azwitterions 0amolecular dynamics simulation-guided experiment 0azwitterionic nanogel nanofiltration membrane 0asurface structure tuning 0apathogen-repellent surface1 aGuo, Wei1 aLiu, Zi-Yu1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1073-89171 aJin, Zhiqiang1 aFan, Jun-Bing1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3273-934X1 aZhao, Sui0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2021 Apr. 12, v. 13, no. 15 p.18237-18246dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.1c003783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03165naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245015900162300001400321520187600335592002802211650001002239650001702249650003502266650001802301650002702319650001002346650001402356650001602370650001502386650001002401653001402411653001302425653003502438653001702473653001002490653001902500700001902519773011402538856008202652852000902734655001202743IND60480899020210510000000.0210510e20111001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048089902DNAL7 a10.2478/v10298-012-0024-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIrimia, L.10aGis applications in viticulture: the spatial distribution analysis of slope inclination and slope exposure in Huşi vine growing centre – Huşi vineyard  ap. 51-59.  aThe paper presents the results of a study regarding the spatial distribution of slope exposure and slope inclination in Husi vine growing centre, Husi vineyard. These factors determine the ecological suitability of an area for vine growing and influence, to a large extent, both directions of wine production and grape quality. The knowledge in their share and variation in vine growing areas, allows to establish the proper grapevine varieties, to place each variety in the optimum location (microzoning), to choose the optimal training system and the appropriate maintenance techniques for the vineyard area. The technology that allows such analysis and the elaboration of maps with spatial distribution of the ecological factors is GIS (Geographic Information Systems), an instrument of information technologies introduced in the last years in viticulture too. The research presents a case study in which GIS is used to determine the geomorphological features of Husi vine growing center, the local variation of the slopes and the spatial distribution of ecological suitability in the vineyard, depending on these factors. The results show that, in relation to suitability of slope inclination and slope exposure, Husi center includes four areas with different suitability for vine growing. Of the total vineyard area, 42.2% (903.2 ha) has south and predominantly south exposure, the most favorable for vines, and 37.98% (814.58 ha) northern exposure, bad or limiting for vines. The slope analysis shows that 29.19% (624.2 ha) is suitable for high production varieties, and 70.81% (1515.6 ha) for quality wines varieties. According to the suitability of slope inclination and slope exposure, the most favorable for vine cultivation is SD4 area, that includes Recea and Galbena lands, while the worst for the vines is SD1 unit that includes Rusca, Schit and Ochi lands.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVitis 3acase studies 3ageographic information systems 3ageomorphology 3ainformation technology 3avines 3avineyards 3aviticulture 3awinemaking 3awines 0aGrapevine 0aVineyard 0aGeographic Information Systems 0aClimate maps 0aSlope 0aSope exposure.1 aPatriche, C.V.0 tCercetări agronomice în Moldova.g2011 Oct. 1, v. 44, no. 1 p.51-59dVersitawJournal:6287x2067-18657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2478/v10298-012-0024-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03161naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100001400180245008100194300001800275506007600293520128500369592002801654506003701682650002201719650000801741650002101749650001901770650002601789650003101815650001201846650001301858650001601871650000901887650002001896650002901916650001301945653002201958653001501980653001501995653003002010653002602040653002802066653002502094653001302119653001102132653001702143700002102160700002302181700001602204700002402220700002102244700002002265700001802285700001702303773011902320856007502439852000902514655001202523IND60568374420221207085233.0170507e20141107xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056837442DNAL7 a10.1021/pr50035932doi7 aPMC42275502pmcid7 a249027152pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBai, Bing10aIntegrated Approaches for Analyzing U1-70K Cleavage in Alzheimer’s Disease  ap. 4526-4534.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe accumulation of pathologic protein fragments is common in neurodegenerative disorders. We have recently identified in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) the aggregation of the U1-70K splicing factor and abnormal RNA processing. Here, we present that U1-70K can be cleaved into an N-terminal truncation (N40K) in ∼50% of AD cases, and the N40K abundance is inversely proportional to the total level of U1-70K. To map the cleavage site, we compared tryptic peptides of N40K and stable isotope labeled U1-70K by liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (MS), revealing that the proteolysis site is located in a highly repetitive and hydrophilic domain of U1-70K. We then adapted Western blotting to map the cleavage site in two steps: (i) mass spectrometric analysis revealing that U1-70K and N40K share the same N-termini and contain no major modifications; (ii) matching N40K with a series of six recombinant U1-70K truncations to define the cleavage site within a small region (Arg300 ± 6 residues). Finally, N40K expression led to substantial degeneration of rat primary hippocampal neurons. In summary, we combined multiple approaches to identify the U1-70K proteolytic site and found that the N40K fragment might contribute to neuronal toxicity in Alzheimer’s disease.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAlzheimer disease 3aRNA 3aWestern blotting 3ahydrophilicity 3aliquid chromatography 3aneurodegenerative diseases 3aneurons 3apeptides 3aproteolysis 3arats 3astable isotopes 3atandem mass spectrometry 3atoxicity 0amass spectrometry 0aLC−MS/MS 0aproteomics 0aneurodegenerative disease 0aAlzheimer’s disease 0astable isotope labeling 0aproteolytic cleavage 0aU1 snRNP 0aU1-70K 0aRNA splicing1 aChen, Ping-Chung1 aHales, Chadwick

The antiviral effect of thirty fluoroquinolones on the infectivity of African swine fever virus (ASFV) was screened in vitro. There was a severe reduction of the cytopathic effect in ASFV-infected Vero cells when exposed to six independent fluoroquinolones, or to some of their combinations, from an early phase of infection. Moreover, after 7-day treatments, ASFV genome could not be detected by PCR, and the culture supernatants were unable to infect new cell cultures. Pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis revealed a diminished viral DNA replication without identifiable genome fragmentation in cells exposed to fluoroquinolones. In parallel, altered patterns of viral protein synthesis were observed from early infection. The overall results indicate that bacterial topoisomerase inhibitors interfere with the ASFV replication cycle probably by targeting a putative ASFV-topoisomerase II, opening a new window for antiviral treatments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAfrican swine fever 3aAfrican swine fever virus 3aantiviral properties 3acell culture 3acytopathogenicity 3afluoroquinolones 3agenome 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aprotein synthesis 3apulsed-field gel electrophoresis 3ascreening 3avaccines 3aviral proteins 3avirus replication 2aAfrican Swine Fever Virusxdrug effectsxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aAnimals 2aAntiviral Agentsxpharmacology 2aChlorocebus aethiops. 2aFluoroquinolonesxpharmacology 2aMicrobial Sensitivity Tests 2aSwine 2aVero Cells 2aVirus Replicationxdrug effects 0aAfrican swine fever virus 0aFluoroquinolones 0aViral DNA replication 0aViral protein synthesis 0aAntivirals1 aFreitas, Ferdinando B.1 aSimões, Margarida,1 aMartins, Carlos1 aLeitão, Alexandre1 aFerreira, Fernando0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2013 July 26, v. 165, no. 1-2 p.86-94dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8205x0378-11357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2013.01.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03035naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002100166245013600187300001800323520137600341592002801717650001101745650001001756650001901766650001301785650000901798650001801807650001801825650002601843650001001869650001301879650001401892650000901906650001001915650001401925650000901939650001301948650001201961650003201973650003702005650000902042650001402051650005802065650001102123650000902134650000902143650002102152650000902173650002602182700002002208700002002228700002902248773009902277856004802376852000902424655001202433IND50067186820221120173336.0130616e201307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006718682DNAL7 a237083972pmid7 a10.1007/s00436-013-3443-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHervías, Sandra10aEffect of exotic mammalian predators on parasites of Cory's shearwater: ecological effect on population health and breeding success  ap. 2721-2730.  aPredator activity around the nests induces stress in breeding birds, which may have weaker immunity and are therefore more susceptible to parasite infections. The influence of predators on parasites has only been observed in land birds, and most studies are experimental. As seabird colonies offer excellent conditions for parasites, here we assess the influence of mouse, rat, and cat activity on parasites in Cory's shearwater (Calonectris diomedea borealis). Adults were examined for blood parasites and one adult and the juvenile from 53 nests were inspected for ectoparasites over two consecutive years (2010 and 2011). Nests differed in their physical characteristics and indices of mammal predator activity and were checked weekly to assess breeding success. Our results showed absence of blood parasites. Among the environmental factors, predator pressure received the most support (89 %) from the data as influencing nest ectoparasite intensity. Birds most infected had worse body condition, and breeding success was negatively influenced by predator activity and ectoparasite intensity. To our knowledge, this is the first analysis of the interaction between mammal predators and ectoparasites in seabird species and supports greater protection through eradication efforts. In addition, we provide the first data on the endoparasite fauna of Cory's shearwater.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3ablood 3abody condition 3abreeding 3acats 3aectoparasites 3aendoparasites 3aenvironmental factors 3afauna 3aimmunity 3ajuveniles 3amice 3anests 3apredators 3arats 3aseabirds 2aAnimals 2aBird Diseasesxparasitology 2aBirdsxparasitologyxphysiology. 2aCats 2aEcosystem 2aEctoparasitic Infestationsxparasitologyxveterinary. 2aFemale 2aMale 2aMice 2aNesting Behavior 2aRats 2aStress, Physiological1 aRamos, Jaime A.1 aNogales, Manuel1 aRuiz de Ybáñez, Rocío0 tParasitology research.g2013 July, v. 112, no. 7 p.2721-2730dSpringer-Verlagx0932-01137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-013-3443-y  aDNAL 7aarticle03414naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006600150245013400216300001400350520179600364592002802160650001302188650001702201650002002218650001902238650002602257650001302283650003502296650001302331650001102344650001502355650001902370650001902389650002202408650001402430650001502444650001302459651001102472653002302483653003102506653001802537653001602555653001802571700002202589700002602611700002202637700002602659773010502685856008502790852000902875655001202884IND60605648420221121035706.0190215e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060564842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocon.2015.12.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHarpenslager, Sarah F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0338-337210aHarnessing facilitation: Why successful re-introduction of Stratiotes aloides requires high densities under high nitrogen loading  ap. 17-23.  aDense mats of floating vegetation form complex structures that support high biodiversity in wetlands. Since the 1960s, however, high-density stands of Stratiotes aloides have shown strong declines throughout Europe and restoration efforts have often failed, both of which have been linked to high nitrogen (N) input rates. The low success rate of reintroduction is striking, since seemingly healthy, high-density stands are observed to grow under similar environmental conditions. We therefore hypothesise that N tolerance of S. aloides increases with density due to joint N uptake and detoxification. To test our hypothesis, we set up a controlled full factorial mesocosm experiment in which we manipulated N loading and S. aloides density, and investigated interacting effects on habitat biogeochemistry and plant performance. High-density S. aloides stands strongly lowered ammonium availability through shared uptake, even at extremely high N loads. Furthermore, dense stands strongly reduced water layer oxygen concentrations, which stimulated sediment phosphorus mobilisation, and increased carbon dioxide concentrations, which enhanced underwater photosynthesis. High-density stands thus not only detoxify ammonium, but also facilitate population growth through habitat manipulation. Combined, these mechanisms enabled S. aloides to remain viable at high loads of 800kgNha−1y−1, whereas low-density stands already collapsed at 200kgNha−1y−1. Overall, our results show that under similar environmental conditions, high-density stands can thrive, while restoration or natural recruitment by a low number of individuals may be impossible. We therefore conclude that acknowledging and harnessing intraspecific facilitation can be vital for successful conservation and restoration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium 3abiodiversity 3abiogeochemistry 3acarbon dioxide 3aenvironmental factors 3ahabitats 3anatural resources conservation 3anitrogen 3aoxygen 3aphosphorus 3aphotosynthesis 3apollution load 3apopulation growth 3asediments 3avegetation 3awetlands 3aEurope 0aEcosystem engineer 0aIntraspecific facilitation 0aNH4+-toxicity 0aRestoration 0aShared uptake1 aLamers, Leon P.M.1 avan der Heide, Tjisse1 aRoelofs, Jan G.M.1 aSmolders, Alfons J.P.0 tBiological conservation.g2016 Mar., v. 195 p.17-23dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl44607x0006-32077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2015.12.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03425naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100006400154245012600218300001600344520196900360592002802329650001002357650002002367650001702387650002102404650001002425650002202435650001502457650001602472650001302488653003202501653002902533653002502562653005802587653005202645653000902697700001802706700002502724700002002749773012402769856008902893852000902982655001202991IND60553763820221120102313.0190410e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055376382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2016.07.0432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBag, Subhendu Sekhar1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5232-479310aHybridization accompanying FRET event in labeled natural nucleoside-unnatural nucleoside containing chimeric DNA duplexes  ap. 669-673.  aFörster resonance energy transfer (FRET) is a highly efficient strategy in illuminating the structures, structural changes and dynamics of DNA, proteins and other biomolecules and thus is being widely utilized in studying such phenomena, in designing molecular/biomolecular probes for monitoring the hybridization event of two single stranded DNA to form duplex, in gene detection and in many other sensory applications in chemistry, biology and material sciences. Moreover, FRET can give information about the positional status of chromophores within the associated biomolecules with much more accuracy than other methods can yield. Toward this end, we want to report here the ability of fluorescent unnatural nucleoside, triazolylphenanthrene (TPhenBDo) to show FRET interaction upon hybridization with fluorescently labeled natural nucleosides, PerU or OxoPyU or PerU, forming two stable chimeric DNA duplexes. The pairing selectivity and the thermal duplex stability of the chimeric duplexes are higher than any of the duplexes with natural nucleoside formed. The hybridization results in a Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) from donor triazolylphenanthrene of TPhenBDo to acceptor oxopyrene of OxoPyU and/or to perylene chromophore of PerU, respectively, in two chimeric DNA duplexes. Therefore, we have established the FRET process in two chimeric DNA duplexes wherein a fluorescently labeled natural nucleoside (OxoPyU or PerU) paired against an unnatural nucleoside (TPhenBDo) without sacrificing the duplex stability and B-DNA conformation. The hybridization accompanying FRET event in these classes of interacting fluorophores is new. Moreover, there is no report of such designed system of chimeric DNA duplex. Our observed phenomenon and the design can potentially be exploited in designing more of such efficient FRET pairs for useful application in the detection and analysis of biomolecular interactions and in material science application.  aPublisher supplied data 3aB-DNA 3aenergy transfer 3afluorescence 3afluorescent dyes 3agenes 3amaterials science 3amonitoring 3anucleosides 3aproteins 0aOxopyrenyl uridine (OxoPyU) 0aPerylenyl uridine (PerU) 0aUnnatural nucleoside 0aTriazolylphenanthrene nucleobase analogues (TPhenBDo) 0aNatural nucleoside-unnatural nucleoside chimera 0aFRET1 aDas, Suman K.1 aPradhan, Manoj Kumar1 aJana, Subhashis0 tJournal of photochemistry and photobiology.g2016 Sept., v. 162 p.669-673dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6193x1011-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2016.07.0433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03028naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002000155245013300175300001300308520141200321592002801733650002701761650001301788650001901801650001801820650002601838650002301864650001801887650002701905650001201932650000901944650001601953650001101969650002401980650002302004650001802027650002002045653002702065653001502092653002502107653002002132653001302152653001402165700002402179700002502203700002202228700002202250773012702272856009002399852000902489655001202498IND60549583220221118223054.0190318e20161205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054958322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2016.08.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOverney, Anaïs10aDevelopment of synthetic media mimicking food soils to study the behaviour of Listeria monocytogenes on stainless steel surfaces  ap. 7-14.  aListeria monocytogenes is one of the main targets of hygiene procedures in the ready-to-eat food industry due to its ability to persist for months or even years in processing plants, where it can contaminate food during processing. The factors associated with persistence are often those that foster growth, which itself depends on food contamination of surfaces. It is therefore essential to experiment by using food soils or media modelling these soils to understand the behaviour of L. monocytogenes on surfaces of food processing plants. Thus, we set up an experimental plan including three physiological parameters characteristic of the behaviour of cells on surfaces, namely spatial distribution, adhesion forces and the physiological state of sessile L. monocytogenes. These were recorded in two food soils: smoked salmon juice and meat exudate.According to our results, the behaviour of L. monocytogenes on stainless steel surfaces is highly dependent on the food soil used. The presence of viable but non-culturable (VBNC) cells was demonstrated using meat exudate, while all viable cells were recovered using smoked salmon juice. Moreover, on the basis of our criteria and after validation with three strains of L. monocytogenes, we showed that smoked salmon juice can be substituted by a modified culture medium, demonstrating that drawbacks associated with the use of food soils can be overcome.  aPublisher supplied data 3aListeria monocytogenes 3aadhesion 3acell viability 3aculture media 3afood contact surfaces 3afood contamination 3afood industry 3afood processing plants 3ahygiene 3ameat 3ameat juices 3amodels 3aphysiological state 3aready-to-eat foods 3asmoked salmon 3astainless steel 0aListeria monocytogenes 0aFood soils 0aCulture media models 0aStainless steel 0aAdhesion 0aViability1 aChassaing, Danielle1 aCarpentier, Brigitte1 aGuillier, Laurent1 aFirmesse, Olivier0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2016 Dec. 05, v. 238 p.7-14dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl35565x0168-16057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2016.08.0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01797naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001900143245010100162520073900263592002801002650001701030650001201047650001001059650001601069650001401085651001001099653001801109653002101127653001301148700001801161700001901179700001701198700001901215773011401234856007801348852000901426655001201435IND60770243220221121103905.0220314e20220216xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077024322DNAL7 a10.3897/BDJ.10.e768422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Si-Ping10aNeomonodictys aquatica sp. nov.

Although the anti-inflammatory activity of WFF has been reported, the underlying mechanisms for the activity remain unclear. Here, we examined whether the anti-inflammatory activity of WFF is associated with Nrf2, an anti-inflammatory factor, and A20, an ubiquitin-regulator protein that inhibits signaling cascades of endotoxin or cytokines.The water extract of Forsythia suspensa (Thunb.) Vahl was prepared and fingerprinted by HPLC. Cytotoxicity and intracellular ROS induced by WFF were determined by MTT and FACS analyses, respectively. Nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins were analyzed by immunoblot. Expression of mRNA was analyzed by a semi-quantitative RT-PCR. Expression of proteins or genes was quantitated by Image J.WFF activated Nrf2, inducing the expression of Nrf2-dependent genes, such as HO-1, NQO1, and GCLC in RAW 264.7 cells. On the other hand, WFF suppressed NF-κB induced by LPS or TNF-α, which was coincided with the expression of A20. Conversely, WFF failed to suppress NF-κB when A20 expression was silenced by siRNA.WFF activated Nrf2 and expressed A20. Given that Nrf2 suppresses inflammation and A20 broadly disrupts inflammatory signaling cascades, our results suggest that the anti-inflammatory activity of WFF is attributable to Nrf2 and A20.  aPublisher supplied data 3aForsythia suspensa 3aOriental traditional medicine 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3acytotoxicity 3aendotoxins 3agenes 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ainflammation 3amessenger RNA 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 0aWFF 0aTNFAP3 A20 0aHPLC 0aROS 0aMTT 0aFACS 0aRT-PCR 0aHO-1 0aNOQ1 0aGCLC 0aNrf2 0aNF-κB 0aLPS 0aTNF-αα 0aTLR4 0aTNFR 0aForsythia suspensa (Thunb.)

A new species of the genus Pseudidothea Ohlin, 1901 is described from the Burdwood Bank area (South Orkney Islands). It has been collected during the SO-AntEco JR15005 RRS James Clark Ross expedition under the lead of the British Antarctic Survey (BAS). The new species, Pseudidotheaarmata sp. n., is very similar to P.scutata (Stephensen, 1947); however, it is characterised by peculiar supra-ocular spines and a different tubercular pattern.

Although conventional chemotherapy and surgery are effective to some extent, there is always a risk of relapse due to associated side effects, including post-surgical complications and non-discrimination between cancer and normal cells. In this study, we developed a small molecule-based theranostic system, Gal-Dox, which is preferentially taken up by colon cancer cells through receptor-mediated endocytosis. After cancer-specific activation, the active drug Dox (doxorubicin) is released with a fluorescence turn-on response, allowing both drug localization and site of action to be monitored. The therapeutic potency of Gal-Dox was also evaluated, both in vivo and ex vivo, thus illustrating the potential of Gal-Dox as a colorectal cancer theranostic with great specificity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3acolorectal neoplasms 3adoxorubicin 3adrug therapy 3aendocytosis 3afluorescence 3aneoplasm cells 3arelapse 3arisk 3asurgery 0aTargeted drug delivery 0aColon cancer 0aTheranostic 0aβ-Galactosidase 0aDoxorubicin1 aKim, Eun-Joong1 aShi, Hu1 aLee, Jin Yong1 aChung, Bong Geun1 aKim, Jong Seung0 tBiomaterials.g2017, dElsevier Ltdx0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2017.11.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03311naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001800144245013700162300002000299500001900319520191300338592002802251650001902279650001102298650001302309650001602322650001502338650001702353650002302370653001702393653001802410653002702428653002502455700001402480700001302494700001302507700005702520700005602577700001502633773014202648856007802790852000902868655001202877IND60735372120221119205602.0210423e20210407xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073537212DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.1c005542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuiju Zhang, 10aElectron Donor–Acceptor Effect-Induced Organic/Inorganic Nanohybrids with Low Energy Gap for Highly Efficient Photothermal Therapy  ap. 17920-17930.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aFor the design and optimization of near-infrared photothermal nanohybrids, tailoring the energy gap of nanohybrids plays a crucial role in attaining a satisfactory photothermal therapeutic efficacy for cancer and remains a challenge. Herein, we report an electron donor–acceptor effect-induced organic/inorganic nanohybrid with a low energy gap (denoted as ICG/Ag/LDH) by the in situ deposition of Ag nanoparticles onto the CoAl–LDH surface, followed by the coupling of ICG. A combination study verifies that the supported Ag nanoparticles as the electron donor (D) push electrons into the conjugated system of ICG by the electronic interaction between ICG and Ag, while OH groups of LDHs as the electron acceptor (A) pull electrons from the conjugated system of ICG by hydrogen bonding (N···H–O). This induces the formation of the D–A conjugated π-system and has a strong influence on the π-conjugated system of ICG, thus leading to a prominent decrease toward the energy gap and correspondingly an ultra-long redshift (∼115 nm). The resulting ICG/Ag/LDHs show an enhanced photothermal conversion efficiency (∼45.5%) at 808 nm laser exposure, which is ∼1.6 times larger than that of ICG (∼28.4%). Such a high photothermal performance is attributed to the fact that ICG/Ag/LDHs possess a D−π–A hybrid structure and a resulting lower energy gap, thus effectively promoting nonradiative transitions and leading to enhancement of the photothermal effect. Both in vitro and in vivo results confirm the good biocompatible properties and capability of the ICG/Ag/LDHs for NIR-triggered cancer treatment. This research demonstrates a successful paradigm for the rational design and preparation of new nanohybrids through the modulation of electron donor–acceptor effect, which offers a new avenue to achieve efficient phototherapeutic agent for improving the cancer therapeutic outcomes.  aPublisher supplied data 3acancer therapy 3aenergy 3ahydrogen 3ananohybrids 3ananosilver 3aphototherapy 3aphotothermotherapy 0ahydrotalcite 0ahybrid effect 0aelectronic interaction 0aphotothermal therapy1 aLi, Kunle1 aHe, Shan1 aWang, Li1 aGuan, Shanyue1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9842-79821 aZhou, Shuyun1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3189-79761 aXu, Baocai0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2021 Apr. 07, v. 13, no. 15 p.17920-17930dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.1c005543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02916naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094024002200135024001900157040001800176100001900194245010800213300001600321520157800337592002801915653003501943653001901978653002201997653000902019653002702028700002102055700001802076700001802094700002102112700002402133700001402157700002502171700002502196700003102221700002202252700002302274773008902297856008702386852000902473655001202482IND60554853420221117175216.0161025e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055485342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cancergen.2014.10.0022doi7 aPMC42789392pmcid7 a254326682pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVilar, Eduardo10aRole of microsatellite instability-low as a diagnostic biomarker of Lynch syndrome in colorectal cancer  ap. 495-502.  aLynch syndrome is the most common Mendelian disorder predisposing persons to hereditary colorectal cancer. Carriers of MSH6 mutations constitute less than 10% of the total of cases with Lynch syndrome and present with a weaker clinical phenotype, including low levels of microsatellite instability (MSI-L) in colorectal tumors. The frequency of MSH6 mutation carriers among patients presenting with MSI-L colorectal cancer has yet to be determined, as has the appropriate genetic workup in this context. We have reviewed here the clinicopathologic characteristics, immunohistochemistry, and genetic testing results for 71 patients at a single institution diagnosed with MSI-L colorectal cancers. Of 71 patients with MSI-L tumors, 21 underwent genetic testing for MSH6 mutations, three of whom presented with loss of staining of MSH6 and only one of whom carried a pathogenic germline MSH6 mutation in exon 4 (c.2677_2678delCT; p.Leu893Alafs*6). This latter patient had a significant family history of cancer and had a rectal primary tumor that showed instability only in mononucleotide markers. In this cohort of MSI-L patients, we detected no notable clinicopathologic or molecular characteristic that would help to distinguish a group most likely to harbor germline MSH6 mutations. Therefore, we conclude that the prevalence of MSH6 mutations among patients with MSI-L tumors is very low. Microsatellite instability analysis combined with immunohistochemistry of mismatch repair proteins adequately detects potential MSH6 mutation carriers among MSI-L colorectal cancers.  aPublisher supplied data 0aMicrosatellite instability-low 0aLynch syndrome 0acolorectal cancer 0aMSH6 0amononucleotide markers1 aMork, Maureen E.1 aCuddy, Amanda1 aBorras, Ester1 aBannon, Sarah A.1 aTaggart, Melissa W.1 aYing, Jun1 aBroaddus, Russell R.1 aLuthra, Rajyalakshmi1 aRodriguez-Bigas, Miguel A.1 aLynch, Patrick M.1 aYou, Yi-Qian Nancy0 tCancer Genetics.g2014 Oct.,  Dec., v. 207 p.495-502dElsevier Inc.x2210-77627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cancergen.2014.10.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02275naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245009600173300001400269520099300283592002801276650002001304650001701324650001401341650001301355650002001368650002301388650002501411650001301436651001401449653003101463653001301494653001701507653001601524653002701540700001901567700002001586700001901606700002401625773009701649856008601746852000901832655001201841IND60532272920221117172751.0190214e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053227292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anbehav.2014.10.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWolfenden, Andrew10aEndangered pink pigeons treat calls of the ubiquitous Madagascan turtle dove as conspecific  ap. 83-88.  aResponding to allospecific territorial signals may result in the unnecessary expenditure of energy and time and is therefore, in general, not adaptive. The signals of closely related species are often similar owing to common ancestry, especially when species evolve in allopatry. However, selection for species recognition in sympatry tends to result in distinct territorial signals. The endangered pink pigeon, Nesoenas mayeri, endemic to Mauritius, occurs in sympatry with the invasive Madagascan turtle dove, Nesoenas picturata, and their perch-coos are remarkably similar. We conducted playback experiments to test whether pink pigeons respond to coos from Madagascan turtle doves. Pink pigeons responded similarly to playback of conspecific and Madagascan turtle dove coos but not to those of the more distantly related and sympatric Stigmatopelia chinensis. This study stresses the need to identify the impact of N. picturata on the breeding success and conservation of N. mayeri.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNesoenas mayeri 3aStreptopelia 3aallopatry 3aancestry 3aanimal behavior 3aenergy expenditure 3areproductive success 3asympatry 3aMauritius 0aallospecific communication 0abirdsong 0aconservation 0apink pigeon 0aterritorial signalling1 aJones, Carl G.1 aTatayah, Vikash1 aZüel, Nicolas1 ade Kort, Selvino R.0 tAnimal behaviour.g2015 Jan., v. 99 p.83-88dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45841x0003-34727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2014.10.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03177naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001500149245012900164500001900293520207400312592002802386650001702414650002602431650001402457650001202471650001602483651001002499653003102509653002602540653003102566653001402597700001802611773010502629856008402734852000902818655001202827IND60739164420221122055335.0210617e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073916442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cageo.2021.1048222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Jian10aSpatial modelling of hydrothermal mineralization-related geochemical patterns using INLA+SPDE and local singularity analysis  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe complexity of geochemical patterns in surficial media makes it necessary to consider the uncertainty when identifying geochemical anomalies in geochemical prospecting. In this contribution, the type of uncertainty related to spatial modelling of geochemical element distribution based on a limited number of observations is considered. A hybrid method combining the integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) and the stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE), commonly termed “INLA + SPDE”, is employed to simulate the spatial distribution of a geochemical variable. The local singularity analysis (LSA) is then performed on each realization simulated by INLA + SPDE. Based on the ensemble of local singularity exponent maps, geochemical anomalies can be evaluated by considering both the intensity and uncertainty of local singularity. A case study of processing 1:50, 000 stream sediment samples collected from the Fanshan district, Fujian province of China, further illustrates and validates the procedure, and enhance the knowledge of hydrothermal mineralization-related geochemical patterns in this region. The findings indicate that (1) INLA + SPDE offers a viable alternative to existing methods for simulating spatial distribution of geochemical element distributions, with advantages in quantifying uncertainties of model responses as well as model parameters, computational efficiency due to INLA, etc.; (2) it is an effective way to combine INLA + SPDE and LSA to facilitate identifying geochemical anomalies by considering both the intensity and uncertainty of geochemical patterns. The delineated geochemical anomalies based on the mean of local singularity exponents should be paid attention in further geochemical exploration, but those associated with high uncertainty should be taken care of and further verified by other evidences. The workflow that combines INLA + SPDE and LSA can also be used to obtain information from other types of geoscientific data, and can hence enrich the toolbox for further mineral exploration.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3adifferential equation 3asediments 3astreams 3auncertainty 3aChina 0aBayesian spatial modelling 0aGeochemical anomalies 0aLocal singularity analysis 0aINLA+SPDE1 aZuo, Renguang0 tComputers & geosciences.g2021 Sept., v. 154 p.104822-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12438x0098-30047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cageo.2021.1048223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02304naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005300148245007400201300001300275520124900288592002801537650001301565650001301578650001701591650001101608650001301619650001101632650002001643653001701663653001801680653001401698653001901712700001601731773010401747856008201851852000901933655001201942IND60547662020221119002907.0160903e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054766202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gete.2015.10.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMróz, Z.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3933-681510aAnalysis of delamination and damage growth in joined bi-layer systems  ap. 4-28.  aThe analysis of mechanical response of joined bi- or multi-layer systems is a typical problem for both geomechanics and composite technology. The elastic or visco-elastic layers interact through joining interfaces transferring stress state between layers and assuring structure integrity. The typical damage modes are related to progressive delamination at bonding interfaces, affected by distributed layer cracking. The present work is aimed to provide an analytical study of the stress state in a bi-layer system and of the progressive delamination process. The cohesive zone model is applied to simulate the interface response with shear stresses related to displacement discontinuities and to the specific fracture energies in shear mode. The following specific issues are discussed: delamination mode growth with the related critical and post-critical response of evaluation length of the process zone, scale effect of the critical stress. The analysis results can be applied to clarify the effect of material parameters on the damage process and to discuss experimental testing of epoxy joined ceramic elements, with specification of the connection strength, related to both the critical interface stress and the specific fracture energy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aceramics 3acracking 3adelamination 3aenergy 3aepoxides 3amodels 3aviscoelasticity 0aDelamination 0aCohesive zone 0aShear lag 0aDamage process1 aMróz, K.P.0 tGeomechanics for Energy and the Environment.g2015 Dec., v. 4 p.4-28dElsevier Ltdx2352-38087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gete.2015.10.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03097naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001800143245013400161500001400295520142400309592002801733650001601761650001501777650001501792650002501807650001701832650001401849650001101863650001901874650001001893650001701903650000901920650001201929650001501941650001101956650000701967650001201974650001501986650002202001650001602023650001002039650001002049650000902059650001602068700002302084700002002107700002502127700002002152700002002172700002302192700002302215700002402238700002102262773012602283856007702409852000902486655001202495IND60718850320221122225040.0201126e20201028xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071885032DNAL7 a10.3390/antiox91110552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPuri, Chiara 10aUse of a Zwitterionic Surfactant to Improve the Biofunctional Properties of Wool Dyed with an Onion (Allium cepa L.) Skin Extract  aNAL-light  aTo improve the loadability and antioxidant properties of wool impregnated with onion skin extract, the introduction of SB3-14 surfactant in the dyeing process was evaluated. A preliminary investigation on the surfactant–quercetin interaction indicated that the optimal conditions for dye solubility, stability, and surfactant affinity require double-distilled water (pH = 5.5) as a medium and SB3-14 in a concentration above the c.m.c. (2.5 × 10⁻³ M). The absorption profile of textiles showed the flavonoid absorption band (390 nm) and a bathochromic feature (510 nm), suggesting flavonoid aggregates. The higher absorbance for the sample dyed with SB3-14 indicated greater dye uptake, which was further confirmed by HPLC analysis. The Folin–Ciocalteu method was applied to evaluate the total phenol content (TPC) released from the treated wool, while the assays FRAP, DPPH, ABTS, and ORAC were applied to evaluate the corresponding total antioxidant activity (TAC). Higher TPCs (about 20%) and TACs (5–55%) were measured with SB3-14, highlighting textiles with improved biofunctional properties. Spectrophotometric analyses were also performed with an artificial sweat. The potential cytotoxic effect of SB3-14 in both monomeric and aggregated forms, cell viability, and induction of apoptosis were evaluated in RAW 264.7 cells. These analyses revealed that SB3-14 is safe at concentrations below the c.m.c.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAllium cepa 3aabsorbance 3aabsorption 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3aapoptosis 3aassays 3acell viability 3acells 3acytotoxicity 3adyes 3afabrics 3aflavonoids 3aonions 3apH 3aphenols 3asolubility 3aspectral analysis 3asurfactants 3asweat 3awater 3awool 3azwitterions1 aPucciarini, Lucia 1 aTiecco, Matteo 1 aBrighenti, Virginia 1 aVolpi, Claudia 1 aGargaro, Marco 1 aGermani, Raimondo 1 aPellati, Federica 1 aSardella, Roccaldo 1 aClementi, Catia 0 tAntioxidants.g2020 Oct. 28, v. 9, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27130x2076-39217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/antiox91110553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04283naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005600153245013600209500001900345520263800364592002803002650002103030650001903051650001803070650001703088650001603105650001103121650000903132650001303141650002303154650001003177650003003187650002303217650001103240650001403251650001103265650001603276650001003292650001803302650001103320651001203331653002103343653002103364653002503385653002203410653002003432653002103452700001603473700002203489773012103511856008803632852000903720655001203729IND60739164520221122055311.0210610e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073916452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envexpbot.2021.1045262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRepo, Tapani1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7443-627510aAutumn cold acclimation of shoots does not explain the northern distribution limit of three southern exotic tree species in Finland  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aFrost hardiness (FH) is one of the key traits that limits the distribution of tree species in the north. Different species and ecotypes respond differently to the drivers of frost hardening and may therefore have different survival capacities, especially in their northern distribution range. Several southern tree species such as pedunculate oak (Quercus robur L.), Norway maple (Acer platanoides L.), and mountain elm (Ulmus glabra Hudson) have their natural northern distribution limit in Southern Finland. Here, we examined whether insufficient frost hardening in the autumn limits the northwards distribution of these three species. To that end, we monitored phenological events and frost hardening in the autumn in these exotic species in Central Finland, further north from the natural distribution range of the three exotic species, and for the sake of comparison, in the native silver birch (Betula pendula Roth.). In all species, a timely growth cessation was observed. The water content of the stem decreased, and its dry mass content increased rapidly in August before the onset of frost hardening, after which no major changes were observed in these two traits. In the early phase of hardening, there were differences in leaf colouring between the four species. The values of the electrical impedance parameters of the stem changed during frost hardening, with a clear turning point after the first night frosts at the end of September. Depending on the species and hardening phase, the high temperature exotherm (HTE) of the stem was observed between -3 °C and -10 °C, but HTE did not indicate differences between the species in frost hardening. In all four species, frost hardening started at the beginning of September and proceeded first at equal rates, but the hardening was more rapid later in birch than in the other species. The damaging temperature range assessed by the controlled freezing tests became wider with increasing FH. The occurrence rate of the low temperature exotherm (LTE) varied between the species, and the LTE was observed at around -35 °C in the last sampling at the beginning of December (no LTE was observed in birch). We conclude that the hardening of all four species took place in a timely manner so that in each, the frost hardiness was sufficient to survive the autumn frosts at the experimental site in Central Finland. Further studies are needed to examine whether the exotic three species also tolerate temporarily occurring extreme winter conditions such as temperatures below -35 °C, and the high short-term temperature variations in winter and especially in spring.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcer platanoides 3aBetula pendula 3aQuercus robur 3aUlmus glabra 3aacclimation 3aautumn 3acold 3aecotypes 3aelectric impedance 3afrost 3ageographical distribution 3aintroduced species 3aleaves 3aphenology 3aspring 3atemperature 3atrees 3awater content 3awinter 3aFinland 0aAutumn colouring 0aDry mass content 0aElectrical impedance 0aExotherm analysis 0aFrost hardiness 0aLeaf reflectance1 aWu, Dongxia1 aHanninen, Heikki,0 tEnvironmental and experimental botany.g2021 Aug., v. 188 p.104526-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl7512x0098-84727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envexpbot.2021.1045263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03793naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002800150245018000178506011700358506007600475520159300551592002802144506003702172650001302209650001402222650001602236650001902252650003502271650001602306650002302322650001202345650002302357650002102380653001402401653001602415653002502431653001502456653001702471653001902488653002302507653001002530653000802540653000802548653000702556653000702563653000902570653000902579653000902588653000802597653000802605653001002613653000802623653000802631653001002639700002802649700002602677700002702703700002702730700002502757700002602782700002002808700005602828773010502884856008502989852000903074655001203083IND60775499320221207110941.0220628e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077549932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envint.2022.1072502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBabiloni-Chust, Ignacio10aG protein-coupled estrogen receptor activation by bisphenol-A disrupts the protection from apoptosis conferred by the estrogen receptors ERα and ERβ in pancreatic beta cells  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  a17β-estradiol protects pancreatic β-cells from apoptosis via the estrogen receptors ERα, ERβ and GPER. Conversely, the endocrine disruptor bisphenol-A (BPA), which exerts multiple effects in this cell type via the same estrogen receptors, increased basal apoptosis. The molecular-initiated events that trigger these opposite actions have yet to be identified. We demonstrated that combined genetic downregulation and pharmacological blockade of each estrogen receptor increased apoptosis to a different extent. The increase in apoptosis induced by BPA was diminished by the pharmacological blockade or the genetic silencing of GPER, and it was partially reproduced by the GPER agonist G1. BPA and G1-induced apoptosis were abolished upon pharmacological inhibition, silencing of ERα and ERβ, or in dispersed islet cells from ERβ knockout (BERKO) mice. However, the ERα and ERβ agonists PPT and DPN, respectively, had no effect on beta cell viability. To exert their biological actions, ERα and ERβ form homodimers and heterodimers. Molecular dynamics simulations together with proximity ligand assays and coimmunoprecipitation experiments indicated that the interaction of BPA with ERα and ERβ as well as GPER activation by G1 decreased ERαβ heterodimers. We propose that ERαβ heterodimers play an antiapoptotic role in beta cells and that BPA- and G1-induced decreases in ERαβ heterodimers lead to beta cell apoptosis. Unveiling how different estrogenic chemicals affect the crosstalk among estrogen receptors should help to identify diabetogenic endocrine disruptors.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aagonists 3aapoptosis 3abisphenol A 3acell viability 3aendocrine-disrupting chemicals 3aenvironment 3aestrogen receptors 3aligands 3amolecular dynamics 3aprecipitin tests 0aApoptosis 0aBisphenol-A 0aEndocrine disruptors 0aGPER/GPR30 0aHeterodimers 0a17β-estradiol 0aEstrogen receptors 0aBERKO 0aBPA 0aDCF 0aE2 0aER 0aERα 0aERβ 0aGPER 0aLBD 0aMPP 0aPHTPP 0aPLA 0aROS 0asiRNA1 ados Santos, Reinaldo S.1 aMedina-Gali, Regla M.1 aPerez-Serna, Atenea A.1 aEncinar, José-Antonio1 aMartinez-Pinna, Juan1 aGustafsson, Jan-Åke,1 aMarroqui, Laura1 aNadal, Angel1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4178-21520 tEnvironment international.g2022 June, v. 164 p.107250-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6374x0160-41207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2022.1072503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02908naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150100001800168245011900186300001600305520094600321592002801267650001201295650002001307650001401327650001401341650002301355650001701378650001801395650001801413650002401431650001201455650001201467650001801479650002001497650002101517650000901538650001201547650002601559650004701585650001201632650004301644650004601687650002001733650001101753650000901764650000901773650004001782650004701822650001401869650004201883650002201925650001201947700001301959700001901972700001601991700001802007700001402025700001702039773008402056856008502140852000902225655001202234IND4459084020221121025959.0141112e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445908402DNAL7 a216019942pmid7 a10.1016/j.meatsci.2011.04.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Jinquan10aMaternal dietary protein induces opposite myofiber type transition in Meishan pigs at weaning and finishing stages  ap. 221-227.  aTo describe the effects of maternal dietary protein level on offspring skeletal muscle fiber plasticity, 14 Meishan sows were fed on either low-protein (LP) or high-protein (HP) diets throughout gestation and lactation, and the myofiber characteristics of the offspring were observed both at weaning and finishing.

The burden of the intensive treatment required to cure patients is a matter of great concern given the young median age at diagnosis, regardless of tumor location. Thus, a greater understanding of the oncogenic properties of SMARCB1 and the SWI/SNF complex, as well as the clinical aspects of malignant rhabdoid tumors is necessary. Towards this aim, the first international SMARCB1 and rhabdoid tumor symposium was held in Paris, France in December 2013, organized by the collaborative efforts of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (Susan Chi), Swabian Children's Cancer Center/EU-RHAB Center (Michael Frühwald) and Curie Institute (Franck Bourdeaut). This workshop of physicians and other scientists fostered the integration of biologic insights towards clinical application in rhabdoid tumors, and other SWI/SNF-related cancers. The following report is a synopsis of the highlights of this meeting.  aPublisher supplied data 0aRhabdoid 0aATRT 0aSMARCB1 0aINI1 0aSWI/SNF1 aChi, Susan N.1 aFrühwald, Michael C.0 tCancer Genetics.g2014 Sept., v. 207 p.346-351dElsevier Inc.x2210-77627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cancergen.2014.10.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02662naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245021200167300001600379520109000395592002801485650002501513650001601538650001801554650002201572650001301594650000901607650001701616650003101633650001001664650001201674650002501686650001201711650002201723650001201745650001701757650004301774650001901817650001201836700001701848700001901865700002101884700002101905700002001926700002101946773009901967856008102066852000902147655001202156IND60082880520221121001026.0141101e201108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008288052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fsi.2011.05.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Young-Mao10aMolecular cloning and functional analysis of an orange-spotted grouper (Epinephelus coioides) secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC) and characterization of its expression response to nodavirus  ap. 232-242.  aMammalian secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC) is the primary regulator of cell shape and cell adhesion to fibronectin. We, for the first time, report the complete sequencing of SPARC cDNA from orange-spotted grouper. Despite the difference in the lengths of the SPARC transcripts, all of the SPARC molecules encoded a signal peptide, follistain-like copper binding sequence (KGHK) domain, and extracellular domain. The grouper SPARC gene was differentially expressed in vivo and contributed differently to high-level expression of SPARC in muscle. Immunohistochemical staining demonstrated a decreased level of SPARC in nodavirus-infected grouper compared with healthy grouper. Comparative real-time polymerase chain reaction analyses of eye tissues of viral nervous necrosis grouper and healthy grouper were performed. Recombinant SPARC produced changes in grouper cell shape 24 h after treatment. The results provide new insight into the pathogenesis of nodavirus, and demonstrate an experimental rationale for SPARC characterization in nodavirus-infected grouper.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEpinephelus coioides 3aNodaviridae 3acell adhesion 3acomplementary DNA 3acysteine 3aeyes 3afibronectins 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3agrouper 3aimmunohistochemistry 3amammals 3amolecular cloning 3amuscles 3apathogenesis 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asignal peptide 3atissues1 aKuo, Cham-En1 aHuang, Yi-Ling1 aShie, Pei-Shiuan1 aLiao, Jhong-Jian1 aYang, Yuan-Chih1 aChen, Tzong-Yueh0 tFish & shellfish immunology.g2011 Aug., v. 31, no. 2 p.232-242dElsevier Ltdx1050-46487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2011.05.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03352naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002700151245006400178300001500242500001500257520192800272592002802200650002002228650001402248650001002262650001202272650002102284650001002305650000902315650001802324650001302342650001102355650001202366651001002378651001002388653002102398653002302419653002302442653002102465653001502486653002202501653001002523700002202533700005902555773014902614856008602763852000902849655001202858IND60532273020221121023013.0190214e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053227302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anbehav.2014.10.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarcía-Navas, Vicente10aNest decorations: an ‘extended’ female badge of status?  ap. 95-107.  a2019-12-06  aExtended phenotypes as signals are widely distributed among animal taxa. For example, many bird species build eye-catching nests or structures, which can potentially mirror the quality or ability of the builder. Rock sparrow, Petronia petronia, nests are usually overly decorated with feathers belonging to different species. Feather carrying in this and other species seems to play a role beyond their supposed thermoregulatory function, that is, to provide insulation to eggs and developing chicks. In this study, we documented for the first time this intriguing pattern of behaviour in the rock sparrow and experimentally tested its potential role as a sexually selected or status signal by means of a feather supplementation experiment carried out in two distinct populations from Italy and Spain. We found that females were responsible for feather carrying, laid larger clutches and provisioned their young at a lower rate in those nests with experimentally added feathers. Decorated nests sustained fewer intrusions by floater individuals and were defended with greater intensity by both parents than control nests, which supports the role of nest ornamentation as a status signal to conspecifics. Presence of experimental feathers did not significantly increase the frequency with which males provisioned their young but males tended to desert their brood less often and spent more time guarding the brood in experimental nests, indicating that feather presence may also play a role in an intersexual context. Overall, our results allow us to exclude the thermoregulation hypothesis as a likely explanation for the occurrence of these decorations and provide partial evidence for the idea that feather carrying conveys information to the partner and potential competitors. Our study thus supports the notion that nonbodily traits serving a direct (naturally selected) function can also evolve a signalling component.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal behavior 3aphenotype 3anests 3aparents 3athermoregulation 3amales 3aeggs 3aPasseriformes 3afeathers 3achicks 3afemales 3aItaly 3aSpain 0afeather carrying 0anest ornamentation 0afemale competition 0asexual selection 0asignalling 0aPetronia petronia 0abirds1 aValera, Francisco1 aGriggio, Matteo1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5674-05670 tAnimal behaviour.g2015 Jan., v. 99 p.95-107dElsevier LtdaThe Association for the Study of Animal BehaviourwJournal:jnl45841x0003-34727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2014.10.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03165naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245010600165300001100271520163900282592002801921650002301949650002501972650001001997650001902007650001802026650001302044650001602057650001002073650002202083650002002105650001202125650001002137650001302147650001102160650001402171650001702185650002002202650002002222650002802242650002902270650002602299650001702325700005602342700002102398700002802419773010902447856008202556852000902638655001202647IND60632561120221118084114.0190411e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063256112DNAL7 a10.1007/s12041-019-1069-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaeidi, Kobra10aPhaseolus vulgaris genome possesses CAMTA genes, and phavuCAMTA1 contributes to the drought tolerance  ap. 31.  aCalmodulin-binding transcription activators (CAMTAs) are a family of transcription factors that play an important role in plants’ response to the various biotic and abiotic stresses. The common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) is one of the most important crops in the world and plays a pivotal role in sustainable agriculture. To date, the composition of CAMTA genes in genomes of Phaseolus species and their role in resistance to drought stress are not known. In this study, five PhavuCAMTA genes were characterized in common bean genome through bioinformatics analysis, the morphological and biochemical response of 23 Ph. vulgaris genotypes to different levels of drought stress were evaluated and the expression patterns of PhCAMTA1 in the leaf tissues of sensitive and tolerant genotypes were analysed. Gene structure, protein domain organization and phylogenetic analyses showed that the CAMTAs of Phaseolus were structurally similar and clustered into three groups as other plant CAMTAs. Genotypes showed a differential response to drought stress. Thus, the plant height, number of nodes and flower, total chlorophyll and total protein content, and activity of antioxidant enzymes (ascorbate peroxidase and catalase) in plants significantly influenced by genotype and drought stress interaction. Moreover, the resistant and susceptible genotypes were identified according to three-dimensional plots and the expression patterns of PhavuCAMTA1 gene were studied using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The results of the present study serve as the basis for future functional studies on the Phaseolus CAMTA family.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhaseolus vulgaris 3aascorbate peroxidase 3abeans 3abioinformatics 3abiotic stress 3acatalase 3achlorophyll 3acrops 3adrought tolerance 3aenzyme activity 3aflowers 3agenes 3agenotype 3aleaves 3aphylogeny 3aplant height 3aprotein content 3aprotein domains 3asustainable agriculture 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 3awater stress1 aZare, Nasser1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6558-32731 aBaghizadeh, Amin1 aAsghari-Zakaria, Rasool0 tJournal of genetics.g2019 Mar., v. 98, no. 1 p.31-31dSpringer IndiawJournal:jnl16319x0022-13337nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12041-019-1069-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02808naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002700152245011000179500001900289520138500308592002801693650002901721650001201750650002201762650001101784650003001795650002001825650001701845651001101862653001701873653002501890653002401915653001901939700002401958700006601982700006702048700002802115700003402143773011302177856008702290852000902377655001202386IND60739164720221122050534.0210619e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073916472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jaridenv.2021.1045382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSilva, Thiago Abrantes10aEfficiency of technologies to live with drought in agricultural development in Brazil's semi-arid regions  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aVulnerability to water stress brings challenges to water resources management in arid and semi-arid regions and it is an obstacle to socioeconomic development. In this sense, some technologies are used to overcome this bottleneck. The present study sought to investigate the insertion of cisterns and public irrigation schemes in seven sub-basins in Brazil's semi-arid regions, to verify their effects on family farming agricultural development and their suitability according to water availability trend. These technologies were spatialized and agricultural production trend lines, between 1995 and 2017, were generated in order to indicate these technologies efficiency. Finally, the precipitation, surface and subsurface runoff trend was evaluated for all sub-basins. Trend analysis in agricultural production showed that a large part of the municipalities had a decrease in agricultural production and municipalities that had a larger number of cisterns did not achieve good agricultural development, while agricultural irrigation systems brought better results. Regarding physical-natural conditions, subsurface runoff has decreased and an increase in surface runoff was identified, which can be collected through the installation of new cisterns. However, for this purpose, future investigations are important to identify the factors that are affecting cisterns performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural development 3adrought 3airrigated farming 3arunoff 3asocioeconomic development 3asubsurface flow 3awater stress 3aBrazil 0aWater access 0aRainwater harvesting 0aSmallholder farming 0aIrrigation use1 aFerreira, Jéssica,1 aCalijuri, Maria Lúcia1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0918-24751 ados Santos, Vitor Juste1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1224-21061 aAlves, Sabrina do Carmo1 aCastro, Jackeline de Siqueira0 tJournal of arid environments.g2021 Sept., v. 192 p.104538-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl11719x0140-19637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaridenv.2021.1045383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03151naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002800150245017300178506011700351506007600468520124100544592002801785506003701813650001501850650002701865650001101892650001701903650001401920650001601934650001201950650001401962650001601976650001201992650000902004650001402013650001802027650001602045651001102061653001702072653001902089653001502108653001602123653001602139653002402155700002102179700002202200700001902222700002102241700002402262700002602286700002702312700002302339773010502362856008502467852000902552655001202561IND60775499520221207095419.0220628e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077549952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envint.2022.1072522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchwarz, Janine Melanie10aNo evidence for impaired solitary bee fitness following pre-flowering sulfoxaflor application alone or in combination with a common fungicide in a semi-field experiment  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPesticide exposure is considered a major driver of pollinator decline and the use of neonicotinoid insecticides has been restricted by regulatory authorities due to their risks for pollinators. Impacts of new alternative sulfoximine-based compounds on solitary bees and their potential interactive effects with other commonly applied pesticides in agriculture remain unclear. Here, we conducted a highly replicated full-factorial semi-field experiment with the solitary bee Osmia bicornis, an important pollinator of crops and wild plants in Europe, and Phacelia tanacetifolia as a model crop. We show that spray applications of the insecticide sulfoxaflor (product Closer) and the fungicide azoxystrobin (product Amistar), both alone and combined, had no significant negative impacts on adult female survival or the production, mortality, sex ratio and body size of offspring when sulfoxaflor was applied five days before crop flowering. Our results indicate that for O. bicornis (1) the risk of adverse impacts of sulfoxaflor (Closer) on fitness is small when applied at least five days before crop flowering and (2) that azoxystrobin (Amistar) has a low potential of exacerbating sulfoxaflor effects under field-realistic conditions.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aOsmia rufa 3aPhacelia tanacetifolia 3aadults 3aazoxystrobin 3abody size 3aenvironment 3afemales 3amortality 3apollinators 3aprogeny 3arisk 3asex ratio 3asolitary bees 3asulfoxaflor 3aEurope 0aAzoxystrobin 0aOsmia bicornis 0aPesticides 0aPollinators 0aSulfoxaflor 0aMitigation measures1 aKnauer, Anina C.1 aAllan, Matthew J.1 aDean, Robin R.1 aGhazoul, Jaboury1 aTamburini, Giovanni1 aWintermantel, Dimitry1 aKlein, Alexandra-Maria1 aAlbrecht, Matthias0 tEnvironment international.g2022 June, v. 164 p.107252-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6374x0160-41207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2022.1072523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02241naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100001900137245011100156300001800267520098600285650001401271650001701285650004301302650001501345650001401360650001101374650001401385650001501399650001401414650001901428650001101447650001901458650004401477700002301521700002001544700002301564700003301587773016201620856004001782852000901822655001201831IND4534975020221119084752.0150914s2014    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND453497502DNAL7 a10.1021/jf404198w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStorkey, Corin10aMechanisms of Degradation of the Natural High-Potency Sweetener (2R,4R)-Monatin in Mock Beverage Solutions  ap. 3476-3487.  aThe sodium, potassium, or mixed sodium/potassium salt of the naturally occurring high-potency sweetener (2R,4R)-monatin, also known by the common name arruva, degrades over time in model beverage solutions in the presence of light. By use of UHPLC, LCâMS/MS, and peroxide assays, it has been demonstrated that degradation is accelerated by UV/visible light and the presence of trace metal ions. Data are presented that are consistent with a role for singlet oxygen ((1)O(2)), free radicals, and peroxides (both H(2)O(2) and organic peroxides) in monatin oxidation. Separation of degradation products by UHPLC/HPLC or LCâMS/MS provided evidence for the formation of hydroxylated and peroxide species formed on the indole ring (mass increases 16 and 32, respectively) as well as multiple ring and side-chain oxidation and scission products. Model oxidation systems using the photosensitizer Rose Bengal as a source of (1)O(2) support the proposed photodegradation pathways. 3abeverages 3acommon names 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ametal ions 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3aperoxides 3aphotolysis 3apotassium 3asinglet oxygen 3asodium 3atrace elements 3aultra-performance liquid chromatography1 aPattison, David I.1 aGaspard, Dan S.1 aHagestuen, Erik D.1 aDavies, M.

In parallel, ISARM influenced the shape and direction of the United Nations “Draft articles on the law of transboundary aquifers” appended to UN Resolution 63/124 of 2008. Both stimulated cooperation among concerned States, and provided a frame of reference for the legal grounding of such cooperation in aquifer-specific agreements.Through this synergistic paradigm, ISARM has made an impact on the shape and direction of cooperation in the Guaraní Aquifer in South America, and in the Iullemeden and Taoudeni/Tanezrouft Aquifer Systems (ITAS) in the Sahel region of Africa. It is having an influence on the shape and direction of cooperation being negotiated on the Stampriet Aquifer System in Southern Africa, and on the Ocotepeque-Citalá Aquifer in Central America. The link of ISARM to other international aquifer agreements on record is tenuous, and ISARM’s influence on their generation speculative. The visibility of ISARM has faded since 2012, however its legacy is lasting.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSahel 3aUnited Nations 3aaquifers 3agovernance 3aCentral America 3aLatin America 3aSouth America 3aSouthern Africa 0aInternational aquifers 0aInternational aquifers agreements 0aInternational groundwater law 0aUN draft articles on the law of transboundary aquifers0 tJournal of hydrology.g2018 Dec., v. 20 p.15-20dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23229x2214-58187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrh.2018.04.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03818naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245018800166506011700354506007600471520182400547592002802371506003702399650003502436650002202471650001802493650001602511650002002527650001202547650002302559650001902582650001702601650001302618653002102631653002302652653002202675653002402697653001302721700001502734700005502749700001702804700001902821700002002840700001302860700001902873700001502892700001802907700001602925700001502941700001702956700001602973700001502989700001303004773010503017856008503122852000903207655001203216IND60775499620221207095425.0220628e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077549962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envint.2022.1072552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNing, Yujie10aInvestigation of selenium nutritional status and dietary pattern among children in Kashin-Beck disease endemic areas in Shaanxi Province, China using duplicate portion sampling method  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSelenium deficiency is a primary risk factor of Kashin-Beck disease (KBD). This study aimed to investigate whether children in endemic areas could maintain sufficient selenium intake after termination of selenium supplement administration, and evaluate their comprehensive nutritional status and dietary structure. Duplicate portion sampling combined with a questionnaire was adopted to collect data on categories and quantity of all food ingested in three consecutive days. Occipital hair was also collected to detect selenium content by hydride generation atomic fluorescence spectrometry (HGAFS). CDGSS3.0 software and factor analysis were integrated to assess the children’s comprehensive nutritional status and dietary structure. This study included 240 sex-matched (1:1) children aged 7–12 years from KBD endemic (n = 120) and non-endemic (n = 120) areas. Overall, 720 solid food, 720 liquid, and 240 hair samples were collected for selenium determination. The mean selenium level in hair of children in endemic areas (0.38 ± 0.16 mg/kg) was significantly lower than that in children in non-endemic areas (0.56 ± 0.28 mg/kg, Z = −5.249, p < 0.001). The dietary selenium intake of children in endemic areas was 40.0% lower than that in children in non-endemic areas (Z = −9.374, p < 0.001). Children in endemic areas consumed significantly less diverse dietary items leading to significantly less intake of multiple nutrients compared to children in non-endemic areas. The dietary selenium intake of most children in endemic areas was less than the recommended amount. The dietary structure of children was undiversified, which limited the intake of multiple nutrients. Therefore, comprehensive nutrition rather than sole selenium intake should be the primary concern in the future.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3acomputer software 3aeating habits 3aenvironment 3afactor analysis 3aliquids 3anutritional status 3aquestionnaires 3arisk factors 3aselenium 0aSelenium content 0aMultiple nutrients 0aDuplicate portion 0aKashin-Beck disease 0aChildren1 aHu, Minhan1 aChen, Sijie1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4913-63661 aZhang, Feiyu1 aYang, Xiaodong1 aZhang, Qingping1 aGong, Yi1 aHuang, Ruitian1 aLiu, Yanli1 aChen, Feihong1 aPei, Leilei1 aGuo, Xiong1 aKang, Lianke1 aWang, Xinyi1 aZhang, Yan1 aWang, Xi0 tEnvironment international.g2022 June, v. 164 p.107255-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6374x0160-41207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2022.1072553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02561naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002700141245016800168520144600336592002801782650001501810650001901825650001501844650002001859650001501879650001301894700002001907700003101927700001901958700002301977700001802000773012002018856007602138852000902214655001202223IND60768229020221120145519.0220225e20220209xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076822902DNAL7 a10.3390/ani120404112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNekaris, K. Anne-Isola10aTraining in the Dark: Using Target Training for Non-Invasive Application and Validation of Accelerometer Devices for an Endangered Primate (Nycticebus bengalensis)  aAccelerometers offer unique opportunities to study the behaviour of cryptic animals but require validation to show their accuracy in identifying behaviours. This validation is often undertaken in captivity before use in the wild. While zoos provide important opportunities for trial field techniques, they must consider the welfare and health of the individuals in their care and researchers must opt for the least invasive techniques. We used positive reinforcement training to attach and detach a collar with an accelerometer to an individual Bengal slow loris (Nycticebus bengalensis) at the Shaldon Wildlife Trust, U.K. This allowed us to collect accelerometer data at different periods between January–June 2020 and January–February 2021, totalling 42 h of data with corresponding video for validation. Of these data, we selected 54 min where ten behaviours were present and ran a random forest model. We needed 39 15-min sessions to train the animal to wear/remove the collar. The accelerometer data had an accuracy of 80.7 ± SD 9.9% in predicting the behaviours, with 99.8% accuracy in predicting resting, and a lower accuracy (but still >75% for all of them apart from suspensory walk) for the different types of locomotion and feeding behaviours. This training and validation technique can be used in similar species and shows the importance of working with zoos for in situ conservation (e.g., validation of field techniques).  aPublisher supplied data 3aNycticebus 3aaccelerometers 3aalgorithms 3acaptive animals 3alocomotion 3awildlife1 aCampera, Marco 1 aChimienti, M.q(Marianna),1 aMurray, Carly 1 aBalestri, Michela 1 aShowell, Zak 0 tAnimals.g2022 Feb. 09, v. 12, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani120404113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02260naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245011400171520110700285592002801392650001501420650001101435650000901446650002501455650001301480650002401493653001901517653002301536653002301559653001701582653002801599700001801627700002901645700002801674773009001702856008501792852000901877655001201886IND60782786020221119171111.0221004e20221015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078278602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2022.1245862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFarrokhi, Meysam10aDynamic simulation and optimization of a novel energy system with Hydrogen energy storage for hotel buildings  aIn the current study, an innovative smart energy system based on hybrid solar-GT energies is proposed. Transient performance assessment and techno-economic analyses are conducted to evaluate the dynamic performance of the system. The system has three main parts: solar panels, a Hydrogen production and storage system and gas turbine system, a chiller, and several heat exchangers and auxiliary components. The goal is to set a stand-alone system to generate the need of the building, including heating, power, and cooling. The system is an off-grid system due to its energy storage system. The system is analyzed comprehensively from 3E standpoints. A parametric study of key design variables is performed, and optimization is carried out to find the best solution point. Results indicate that at the optimized point, the system reaches the effectiveness of 39.5%, the emission of 0.85 kg/kWh and the Levelized product cost of 0.051 $/kWh. Furthermore, increasing the pressure of the (absorption chiller) AC in the (gas turbine) GT cycle from 1.5 to 7.5 results in a sharp decline in net output work.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aenergy 3aheat 3ahospitality industry 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen production 0aHotel building 0aDynamic simulation 0aRenewable energies 0aOptimization 0aHydrogen energy storage1 aJavani, Nader1 aMotallebzadeh, Roghayyeh1 aEbrahimpour, Abdolsalam0 tEnergy.g2022 Oct. 15, v. 257 p.124586-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2022.1245863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02610naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245006300165300001300228500001900241520169500260592002801955650001401983650002501997650001702022650001502039700001902054700002102073700001602094700002502110773009202135856004802227852000902275655001202284IND50071675820221118030110.0140105e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007167582DNAL7 a10.1007/s10682-013-9658-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJain, Manjari12aA rain forest dusk chorus: cacophony or sounds of silence?  ap. 1-22.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aA rain forest dusk chorus consists of a large number of individuals of acoustically communicating species signaling at the same time. How different species achieve effective intra-specific communication in this complex and noisy acoustic environment is not well understood. In this study we examined acoustic masking interference in an assemblage of rain forest crickets and katydids. We used signal structures and spacing of signalers to estimate temporal, spectral and active space overlap between species. We then examined these overlaps for evidence of strategies of masking avoidance in the assemblage: we asked whether species whose signals have high temporal or spectral overlap avoid calling together. Whereas we found evidence that species with high temporal overlap may avoid calling together, there was no relation between spectral overlap and calling activity. There was also no correlation between the spectral and temporal overlaps of the signals of different species. In addition, we found little evidence that species calling in the understorey actively use spacing to minimize acoustic overlap. Increasing call intensity and tuning receivers however emerged as powerful strategies to minimize acoustic overlap. Effective acoustic overlaps were on average close to zero for most individuals in natural, multispecies choruses, even in the absence of behavioral avoidance mechanisms such as inhibition of calling or active spacing. Thus, call temporal structure, intensity and frequency together provide sufficient parameter space for several species to call together yet communicate effectively with little interference in the apparent cacophony of a rain forest dusk chorus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacoustics 3aanimal communication 3arain forests 3aunderstory1 aDiwakar, Swati1 aBahuleyan, Jimmy1 aDeb, Rittik1 aBalakrishnan, Rohini0 tEvolutionary ecology.g2014 Jan., v. 28, no. 1 p.1-22dSpringer-Verlagx0269-76537nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10682-013-9658-7  aDNAL 7aarticle03294naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003200147245012300179300001400302520135400316592002801670650000801698650002801706650002101734650001501755650001501770650001301785650001601798650002701814650001401841650001901855650002301874650001001897650000901907650001501916650001301931650002101944650001001965650001801975653002001993653002602013653002202039653002102061653002102082653001002103700002902113700002902142700002502171700002202196700003102218700002302249700002502272700007002297700002602367700006502393773011902458856008202577852000902659655001202668IND60622533520221120205825.0190129e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062253352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.abb.2018.11.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCamera, Fernanda Dal’Maso10aCardioprotective effects of physical exercise on redox biology in mice exposed to hand-rolled cornhusk cigarette smoke  ap. 50-55.  aThe present study sought to evaluate the effects of physical training on histological parameters and oxidative stress in the myocardium of mice chronically exposed to hand-rolled cornhusk cigarette (HRCC) smoke. Male Swiss mice (60 days old, 30–35 g) were either exposed to ambient air or passively exposed to the smoke of 12 cigarettes daily over 3 sessions (4 cigarettes per session) for 60 consecutive days with or without physical training for 8 weeks. Forty-eight hours after the last training session, the heart was surgically removed for histological analysis and measurement of oxidative stress parameters. Histological imaging revealed cell disruption, with poorly defined nuclei, in the mice exposed to HRCC smoke, but not in the control group. However, mice exposed to HRCC smoke with physical training displayed signs of tissue repair and improved tissue integrity. Biochemical analysis revealed decreased production of superoxide, 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein (DCF), and nitrite, as well as decreased protein carbonylation, in the physical training groups, likely due to the exercise-induced increase in glutathione peroxidase (GPX) activity and glutathione (GSH) content. Taken together, our results suggest that physical exercise exerts cardioprotective effects by modulating the redox responses in animals exposed to HRCC smoke.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3acardioprotective effect 3achronic exposure 3acigarettes 3acorn husks 3aexercise 3aglutathione 3aglutathione peroxidase 3ahistology 3aimage analysis 3alaboratory animals 3amales 3amice 3amyocardium 3anitrites 3aoxidative stress 3asmoke 3atissue repair 0aCigarette smoke 0aHand-rolled corn-husk 0aPhysical exercise 0aOxidative stress 0aOxidative damage 0aHeart1 aPozzi, Bruna Gianatassio1 aPaganini, Carla de Souza1 aSorato, Helen Rebelo1 aTavares, Fernanda1 aPereira, Bárbara da Costa1 aPedroso, Giulia S.1 aRoman, Silvane Souza1 aSilveira, Paulo Cesar Lock1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4908-22571 aNesi, Renata Tiscoski1 aPinho, Ricardo Aurino1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3116-45530 tArchives of biochemistry and biophysics.g2019 Jan., v. 661 p.50-55dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11658x0003-98617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.abb.2018.11.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03542naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245012200165300001600287520169000303592002801993650002002021650001902041650002502060650002202085650001602107650001202123650002102135650002002156650001402176650001002190650002202200650004502222650001602267650003302283650001402316650001202330650002702342650001102369650001402380650001502394650004702409650001802456650002202474650001302496650002002509650002202529650001402551651001302565700002102578700002502599700002602624700001802650700002502668700002202693773011102715856008102826852000902907655001202916IND60081323820221118051317.0150217e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008132382DNAL7 a10.1007/s10658-014-0460-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNasehi, Abbas10aAnalysis of genetic and virulence variability of Stemphylium lycopersici associated with leaf spot of vegetable crops  ap. 261-273.  aStemphylium lycopersici (Enjoji) W. Yamam was initially described from tomato and has been reported to infect different hosts worldwide. Sequence analyses of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions 1 and 2, including 5.8S rDNA (ITS-5.8S rDNA) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gpd) gene, random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR), as well as virulence studies were conducted to analyze 46 S. lycopersici isolates. Stemphylium lycopersici isolates used in this study were obtained from diseased tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.), eggplant (Solanum melongena L.), pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) and lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) from major vegetable growing regions of Malaysia, including the three states of Pahang, Johor and Selangor between 2011 and 2012. Phylogenetic analysis of a combined dataset of the ITS-5.8S rDNA and gpd regions indicated that all isolates were clustered in the sub-cluster that comprised S. lycopersici, and were distinguished from other Stemphylium species. Cluster analyses using the UPGMA method for both RAPD and ISSR markers grouped S. lycopersici isolates into three main clusters with similarity index values of 67 and 68 %. The genetic diversity data confirmed that isolates of S. lycopersici are in concordance to host plants, and not geographical origin of the isolates. All S. lycopersici isolates were pathogenic on their original host plants and showed leaf spot symptoms; however, virulence variability was observed among the isolates. In cross-inoculation assays, the representative isolates were able to cause leaf spot symptoms on eggplant, pepper, lettuce and tomato, but not on cabbage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCapsicum annuum 3aLactuca sativa 3aSolanum lycopersicum 3aSolanum melongena 3aStemphylium 3acabbage 3acluster analysis 3adata collection 3aeggplants 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3aglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 3ahost plants 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3aleaf spot 3alettuce 3amicrosatellite repeats 3apepper 3aphylogeny 3aprovenance 3arandom amplified polymorphic DNA technique 3aribosomal DNA 3asequence analysis 3atomatoes 3avegetable crops 3avegetable growing 3avirulence 3aMalaysia1 aKadir, Jugah-Bin1 aNasr-Esfahani, Mehdi1 aAbed-Ashtiani, Farnaz1 aWong, Mui-Yun1 aRambe, Siti-Khadijah1 aGolkhandan, Elham0 tEuropean journal of plant pathology.g2014 Oct., v. 140, no. 2 p.261-273dSpringer-Verlagx0929-18737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10658-014-0460-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03327naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100007500145245004700220300001600267500002000283520187500303592002802178650002702206650002502233650001802258650001402276650003102290650001202321650002202333650002602355650001202381650001302393650002202406650001302428650001502441650001202456650004102468650001402509650001102523650001802534700002002552700002302572700001802595700002202613773010902635856008002744852000902824655001202833IND60790293320221119025242.0220824e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079029332DNAL7 a10.1002/2211-5463.122182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuis in ‘t Veld, Robert A.

Previous proteome and transcriptome studies of Neisseria meningitidis have generated limited insight into differential gene expression due to Hfq loss. In this study, reversed‐phase liquid chromatography combined with data‐independent alternate scanning mass spectrometry (LC‐MSᴱ) was utilized for rapid high‐resolution quantitative proteomic analysis to further elucidate the differentially expressed proteome of a meningococcal hfq deletion mutant. Whole‐cell lysates of N. meningitidis serogroup B H44/76 wild‐type (wt) and H44/76Δhfq (Δhfq) grown in liquid growth medium were subjected to tryptic digestion. The resulting peptide mixtures were separated by liquid chromatography (LC) prior to analysis by mass spectrometry (MSᴱ). Differential expression was analyzed by Student's t‐test with control for false discovery rate (FDR). Reliable quantitation of relative expression comparing wt and Δhfq was achieved with 506 proteins (20%). Upon FDR control at q ≤ 0.05, 48 up‐ and 59 downregulated proteins were identified. From these, 81 were identified as novel Hfq‐regulated candidates, while 15 proteins were previously found by SDS/PAGE/MS and 24 with microarray analyses. Thus, using LC‐MSᴱ we have expanded the repertoire of Hfq‐regulated proteins. In conjunction with previous studies, a comprehensive network of Hfq‐regulated proteins was constructed and differentially expressed proteins were found to be involved in a large variety of cellular processes. The results and comparisons with other gram‐negative model systems, suggest still unidentified sRNA analogs in N. meningitidis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNeisseria meningitidis 3aRNA-binding proteins 3aculture media 3adigestion 3agene expression regulation 3aliquids 3amass spectrometry 3amicroarray technology 3amutants 3apeptides 3aprokaryotic cells 3aproteome 3aproteomics 3aregulon 3areversed-phase liquid chromatography 3aserotypes 3at-test 3atranscriptome1 aKramer, Gertjan1 avan der Ende, Arie1 aSpeijer, Dave1 aPannekoek, Yvonne0 tFEBS Open Bio.g2017 June, v. 7, no. 6 p.777-788dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:23386x2211-54637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2211-5463.122183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02620naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245011900165300001600284520136000300592002801660650001501688650001901703650001301722650001501735650001101750650003101761650001701792650001001809650002201819650002301841650001501864650002101879650001701900653002501917653002501942653000901967700001701976700001601993773011702009856005102126852000902177655001202186IND50075733920221119212042.0140410e20120401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007573392DNAL7 a10.1080/00207233.2012.6648102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNiknia, I.12aA novel experimental method to find dust deposition effect on the performance of parabolic trough solar collectors  ap. 233-252.  aOne main reason why the performance of a parabolic trough collector measured experimentally differs from the simulation results is inaccurate prediction of absorbed solar energy. The amount of absorbed energy of such systems mainly depends on optical properties of mirrors, absorber tube and transmissivity of glass cover of absorber tube. This study examines the thermal performances of three collectors during different periods regarding the weight and thickness of deposited dust. A transient computer code is prepared to estimate thermal performances of clean collectors and compare the results with dusty collectors. A special optical instrument is designed and constructed to measure the reflectivity of mirrors with respect to the thickness of dust deposited on the surface of the mirrors. Based on the measurements a new correlation is developed to find thermal performance of a parabolic collector for various dust thicknesses in comparison to a clean collector. Different cleaning schedules are proposed for the collectors’ field; and thermal performance and yearly solar energy absorption of collectors according to each cleaning schedule are also determined. The performance of a solar-fossil hybrid power plant is studied and the impact of different cleaning schedules on reducing fossil fuel consumption and CO₂ emission is investigated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3acarbon dioxide 3acleaning 3acollectors 3aenergy 3aenergy use and consumption 3afossil fuels 3aglass 3aoptical equipment 3aoptical properties 3aprediction 3asolar collectors 3asolar energy 0aSolar thermal energy 0aParabolic collectors 0aDust1 aYaghoubi, M.1 aHessami, R.0 tInternational journal of environmental studies.g2012 Apr. 1, v. 69, no. 2 p.233-252dRoutledgex1029-04007nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00207233.2012.664810  aDNAL 7aarticle02789naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002900147245011800176300001400294500001900308520166700327592002801994650001802022650001202040650002102052650002002073650001202093650001202105650002702117650001802144650002202162650002302184650001602207700001502223700001502238773009302253856004802346852000902394655001202403IND50071676020221118030045.0140105e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007167602DNAL7 a10.1007/s10682-013-9660-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRamírez-Valiente, J.

In addition, natural selection during the species past can contribute to the observed differentiation. In this study, we examine the geographic variation in a set of four traits related to growth and plant architecture in cork oak (Quercus suber) and investigate to what extent this variation is the result of the effects of ongoing evolution in current environments and the past evolutionary history of the species. Cork oak saplings at the common garden trial exhibited differences in plant architecture associated to cpDNA lineage. Eastern lineages, exhibited the lowest apical dominance and highest branchiness, consistent with the analyses in other cork oak trials. In contrast, patterns linked to the evolutionary past were less evident in height and diameter. These results suggest that selective pressures after cpDNA divergence can have blurred patterns in some traits closely related to fitness, while conserving the past evolutionary imprints in plant architectural traits. Introgressed populations did not show significant differentiation in architecture, which suggests that allele exchanges via hybridization have had a limited effect on population differentiation in cork oak. Finally, populations within lineages also showed differences in growth and architecture. Correlation between population architecture and temperature patterns were observed indicating that environmental factors such as climate also could result crucial in the evolution of plant architecture of cork oak within lineages.  aPublisher supplied data 3aQuercus suber 3aalleles 3aapical dominance 3achloroplast DNA 3aclimate 3aecology 3ageographical variation 3aintrogression 3anatural selection 3aplant architecture 3atemperature1 aAlía, R.,1 aAranda, I.0 tEvolutionary ecology.g2014 Jan., v. 28, no. 1 p.55-68dSpringer-Verlagx0269-76537nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10682-013-9660-0  aDNAL 7aarticle03410naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245010100170300001300271520174300284592002802027650001902055650001102074650001202085650001202097650001102109650002802120650003202148650001602180650001502196650002102211650001302232650001502245650000702260650001702267650000902284650001302293650001902306650001302325650001102338650002102349650001502370650002702385650002202412650002202434650001802456650001002474651001202484700001802496700001802514700002202532700002202554773015302576856008202729852000902811655001202820IND60119300820221120090048.0191003e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011930082DNAL7 a10.1007/s10661-014-4184-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZouahri, Abdelmjid10aEvaluation of groundwater suitability for irrigation in the Skhirat region, Northwest of Morocco  ap. 4184.  aMorocco has arid and semiarid climates. Irrigation is an imperative for agriculture. Skhirat region is known for the production of vegetables. Intensive peri-urban agriculture is associated with inconsiderate pumping of groundwater, and water becomes less abundant and of poor quality resulting in degradation of soil and water quality. Therefore, the objective of this research work was the assessment of the quality of irrigation water. The study site is located in a coastal area and dedicated to intensive land use for growing vegetables in a peri-urban agricultural zone. Monitoring of physicochemical parameters of water was carried out in 77 wells. Parameters like pH, electrical conductivity, and piezometric level were measured in situ while others like total dissolved solids and ionic balance were measured in laboratory whereas other parameters were calculated from those measured. Results showed that Na and Ca are predominant cations while Cl and SO₄ are predominant anions. Piper diagram reveals two facies: sodic and calcic chlorinated. Regarding the permeability index, all wells are suitable for irrigation. The US Salinity Laboratory (USSL) diagram reveals that irrigation water has high salinization risk and low to medium alkalinization risk. The groundwater in the region is classified as very hard category; however, it does not present any risk of sodicity. These waters have a high risk of toxicity to chloride ions. In summary, although the groundwater in the Skhirat region presents a high risk of salinization, it is of good quality suitable for irrigation. Agricultural practices should be well managed to secure safe use of the water resource for a sustainable development of the agriculture in the region.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkalinization 3aanions 3acalcium 3acations 3acoasts 3aelectrical conductivity 3agood agricultural practices 3agroundwater 3airrigation 3airrigation water 3aland use 3amonitoring 3apH 3apermeability 3arisk 3asalinity 3asemiarid zones 3asodicity 3asodium 3asoil degradation 3asoil water 3atotal dissolved solids 3aurban agriculture 3avegetable growing 3awater quality 3awells 3aMorocco1 aDakak, Houria1 aDouaik, Ahmed1 aEl Khadir, Mhamed1 aMoussadek, Rachid0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2015 Jan., v. 187, no. 1 p.4184-4184dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl33242x0167-63697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-014-4184-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03589naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005300147245009300200500002200293506011700315506007600432520194000508592002802448506003702476650001902513650000902532650001302541650001102554650003002565650000902595650001502604653001902619653003702638653001602675653001502691653001302706700005602719700005302775700005902828700005802887773010702945856008203052852000903134655001203143IND60741222120221207105443.0220906e20200908xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074122212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gpb.2020.06.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yanze1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8771-727910aConsistent Alterations of Human Fecal Microbes After Transplantation into Germ-free Mice  aPre-press version  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aFecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) of human fecal samples into germ-free (GF) mice is useful for establishing causal relationships between the gut microbiota and human phenotypes. However, due to the intrinsic differences between human and mouse intestines and the different diets of the two organisms, it may not be possible to replicate human phenotypes in mice through FMT; similarly, treatments that are effective in mouse models may not be effective in humans. In this study, we aimed to identify human gut microbes that undergo significant and consistent changes (i.e., in relative abundances) after transplantation into GF mice in multiple experimental settings. We collected 16S rDNA-seq data from four published studies and analyzed the gut microbiota profiles from 1713 human–mouse pairs. Strikingly, on average, we found that only 47% of the human gut microbes could be re-established in mice at the species level, among which more than 1/3 underwent significant changes (referred to as “variable taxa”). Most of the human gut microbes that underwent significant changes were consistent across multiple human–mouse pairs and experimental settings. Consequently, about 1/3 of human samples changed their enterotypes, i.e., significant changes in their leading species after FMT. Mice fed with a controlled diet showed a lower enterotype change rate (23.5%) than those fed with a noncontrolled diet (49.0%), suggesting a possible solution for rescue. Most of the variable taxa have been reported to be implicated in human diseases, with some recognized as the causative species. Our results highlight the challenges of using a mouse model to replicate human gut microbiota-associated phenotypes, provide useful information for researchers using mice in gut microbiota studies, and call for additional validations after FMT.

MicroRNAs may serve as a better tool for specific early diagnostics and propose their utilization in future molecular medicines. We aimed to measure the microRNAs expressions in oxidative stress linked cardiac hypertrophic condition induced through stimulants as Endothelin and Isoproterenol. Cardiac hypertrophic animal models were confirmed by BNP, GATA4 expression, histological assays, and increased cell surface area. High oxidative stress (ROS level) and decreased antioxidant activities were assessed in hypertrophied groups. Enhanced expression of miR-152, miR-212/132 while decreased miR-142-3p expression was observed in hypertrophic condition. Similar pattern of these microRNAs was detected in HL-1 cells treated with H2O2. Upon administration of antioxidants, the miRNAs expression pattern altered from that of the cardiac hypertrophied model. Present investigation suggests that oxidative stress generated during the cardiac pathology may directly or indirectly regulate anti-hypertrophy pathway elements through microRNAs including antioxidant enzymes, which need further investigation. The down-regulation of free radical scavengers make it easier for the oxidative stress to play a key role in disease progression.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGATA transcription factors 3aanimal models 3aantioxidant activity 3acysteine 3adiagnostic techniques 3adisease course 3aenzymes 3afree radical scavengers 3aheart diseases 3ahistology 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aisoproterenols 3amelatonin 3amicroRNA 3aoxidative stress 3asurface area 0aCardiac hypertrophy 0aOxidative stress 0amiRNAs 0aEndothelin 0aIsoproterenol1 aMushtāq, Iram,1 aMaryam, Sonia1 aFarhan, Anam1 aSaba, Kiran1 aJan, Muhammad Ishtiaq1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2770-30401 aSultan, Aneesa1 aAnees, Mariam1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9049-47181 aDuygu, Burcu1 aHamera, Sadia1 aTabassum, Sobia1 aJaved, Qamar1 ada Costa Martins, Paula A1 aMurtaza, Iram1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8092-52110 tArchives of biochemistry and biophysics.g2019 Jan., v. 661 p.56-65dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11658x0003-98617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.abb.2018.11.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03312naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245007000173300001400243520181700257592002802074650001002102650001202112650001502124650000902139650001202148650001702160650001402177650000902191650001402200650001102214650002302225650002002248650001702268650001602285651000902301651001402310651001102324651001602335651001802351651002902369651001802398700002102416700003002437700002502467700002002492700002002512700002502532700001802557773009002575856008402665852000902749655001202758IND60085974420221121053207.0141101e20120803xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008597442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.quaint.2011.04.0392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChambers, Frank M.10aDevelopment and refinement of proxy-climate indicators from peats  ap. 21-33.  aPeat, especially from acidic mires (bogs), is a natural archive of past environmental change. Reconstructions of past climate from bogs commenced in the 19th Century through examination of visible peat stratigraphy, and later formed the basis for a postglacial climatic scheme widely used in Northwest Europe. Nevertheless, misconceptions as to how bogs grow led to a 50-year lacuna in peat-climate study, before the concept of ‘cyclic regeneration’ in bogs was refuted. In recent decades, research using proxy-climate indicators from bogs has burgeoned. A range of proxies for past hydrological change has been developed, as well as use of pollen, bog oaks and pines and other data to reconstruct past temperatures. Most of this proxy-climate research has been carried out in Northern Europe, but peat-based research in parts of Asia and North America has increased, particularly during the last decade, while research has also been conducted in Australia, New Zealand and South America. This paper reviews developments in proxy-climate reconstructions from peatlands; chronicles use of a range of palaeo-proxies such as visible peat stratigraphy, plant macrofossils, peat humification, testate amoebae and non-pollen palynomorphs; and explains the use of wiggle-match radiocarbon dating and relationship to climate shifts. It details other techniques being used increasingly, such as biomarkers, stable-isotopes, inorganic geochemistry and estimation of dust flux; and points to new proxies under development. Although explicit protocols have been developed recently for research on ombrotrophic mires, it must be recognised that not all proxies and techniques have universal applicability, owing to differences in species assemblages, mire formation, topographic controls, and geochemical characteristics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus 3aQuercus 3abiomarkers 3abogs 3aclimate 3ahumification 3ahydrology 3apeat 3apeatlands 3apollen 3aradiocarbon dating 3astable isotopes 3astratigraphy 3atemperature 3aAsia 3aAustralia 3aEurope 3aNew Zealand 3aNorth America 3aNorthern European region 3aSouth America1 aBooth, Robert K.1 aDe Vleeschouwer, Francois1 aLamentowicz, Mariusz1 aLe Roux, Gaël,1 aMauquoy, Dmitri1 aNichols, Jonathan E.1 avan Geel, Bas0 tQuaternary international.g2012 Aug. 3, v. 268 p.21-33dElsevier Ltdx1040-61827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2011.04.0393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03639naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100002000169245013900189300001600328520153700344592002801881650003601909650001301945650001601958650001901974650001501993650001702008650001302025650002402038650001002062650001002072650005802082650002502140650002302165650001902188650002202207650002802229650002402257650002002281650001102301650001102312650005702323650001802380650000902398650001602407650003002423650002402453650003402477650002002511650001702531650002302548700001702571700002002588700001502608700001702623700001502640700001602655700001702671700001802688700001902706773012302725856008402848852000902932655001202941IND60083787120221122055448.0141101e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008378712DNAL7 a222126012pmid7 a10.1016/j.numecd.2011.10.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDimitriadis, K.10aSoluble receptor for advanced glycation end-product levels are related to albuminuria and arterial stiffness in essential hypertension  ap. 382-388.  aBACKGROUND AND AIMS: Emerging evidence suggests that the soluble receptor for advanced glycation end-products (sRAGE) is implicated in the development of vascular disease. We investigated the interrelationships of sRAGE with albumin to creatinine ratio (ACR) and arterial stiffness in essential hypertension. METHODS AND RESULTS: In 309 untreated non-diabetic hypertensives, ACR values were determined as the mean of three non-consecutive morning spot urine samples and aortic stiffness was evaluated on the basis of carotid to femoral pulse wave velocity (c-f PWV). In all subjects, venous blood sampling was performed for the estimation of sRAGE levels. Patients with low (n = 155) compared to those with high sRAGE values (n = 154) had greater 24-h systolic BP (140 ± 8 vs. 134 ± 7 mmHg, p < 0.0001), exhibited higher ACR (36.3 ± 51.6 vs. 17.2 ± 1.2 mg g⁻¹, p < 0.0001) and c-f PWV (8.3 ± 1.5 vs. 7.8 ± 1.1 m s⁻¹, p = 0.003), independently of confounding factors. Multiple regression analyses revealed that age, male sex, 24-h systolic BP and sRAGE were the ‘independent correlates’ of ACR (R² = 0.493, p < 0.0001), while age, 24-h systolic BP and sRAGE were the ‘independent correlates’ of c-f PWV (R² = 0.428, p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: In hypertensives, decreased sRAGE levels are accompanied by pronounced albuminuria and arterial stiffening. The association of sRAGE with ACR and c-f PWV suggests involvement of sRAGE in the progression of hypertensive vascular damage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadvanced glycation end products 3aalbumins 3aalbuminuria 3ablood sampling 3acreatinine 3ahypertension 3apatients 3aregression analysis 3aurine 2aAdult 2aAlbuminuriaxbloodxetiologyxphysiopathologyxurine. 2aAnalysis of Variance 2aBiomarkersxblood. 2aBlood Pressure 2aCreatininexblood 2aCross-Sectional Studies 2aDisease Progression 2aDown-Regulation 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aHypertensionxbloodxcomplicationsxphysiopathology. 2aLinear Models 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aPredictive Value of Tests 2aPulse Wave Analysis 2aReceptors, Immunologicxblood 2aRisk Assessment 2aRisk Factors 2aVascular Stiffness1 aTsioufis, C.1 aKasiakogias, A.1 aMiliou, A.1 aPoulakis, M.1 aKintis, K.1 aBafakis, I.1 aBenardis, E.1 aTousoulis, D.1 aStefanadis, C.0 tNutrition, metabolism, and cardiovascular diseases.g2013 Apr., v. 23, no. 4 p.382-388dElsevier B.V.x0939-47537nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.numecd.2011.10.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02143naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245009700167300001600264520087900280592002801159650002001187650002501207650001401232650001501246650001801261650001601279650001801295651001001313700001601323700002001339700002201359700001601381700001701397700002001414700002201434700001901456700001901475773011501494856008201609961000901691852000901700655001201709IND60555810120221119043405.0190314e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055581012DNAL7 a10.1007/s10086-016-1575-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrasetyo, Agung10aAnatomical characteristics in 20-year-old Zelkova serrata trees from eight half-sib families  ap. 472-476.  aZelkova serrata (Thunb.)

To analyze the among-family variation of anatomical characteristics in Z. serrata, wood fiber length (WFL), vessel element length in earlywood (VEL), fiber wall thickness (FWT), and vessel diameter in earlywood (VD) were investigated for 20-year-old trees from eight half-sib families. Mean values of WFL, VEL, FWT, and VD ranged from 1.31 to 1.51 mm, 0.19 to 0.22 mm, 1.2 to 2.1 µm, and 131 to 188 µm, respectively. Relatively higher F values were obtained by analysis of variance for WFL and VEL, suggesting that these characteristics might be improved though the selection of mother trees under tree breeding programs. In addition, growth characteristics were not significantly correlated with anatomical characteristics, except for FWT.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZelkova serrata 3aanalysis of variance 3aearlywood 3aseed trees 3atree breeding 3awood fibers 3awood industry 3aJapan1 aEndo, Ryota1 aTakashima, Yuya1 aIshiguri, Futoshi1 aTanabe, Jun1 aAiso, Haruna1 aHidayati, Fanny1 aOhshima, Jyunichi1 aIizuka, Kazuya1 aYokota, Shinso0 tJournal of wood science.g2016 Oct., v. 62, no. 5 p.472-476dSpringer JapanwJournal:jnl56734x1435-02117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10086-016-1575-23Available from publisher's site  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle02370naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002800150245008400178520138900262592002801651650002001679650001101699650001201710650001101722650001701733653002501750653002601775653002101801653001901822700001901841773009001860856008501950852000902035655001202044IND60782786420221119171108.0221004e20221015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078278642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2022.1246352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aaus der Wiesche, Stefan10aDimensional analysis and performance laws for organic vapor flow turbomachinery  aNon-dimensional groups of variables are obtained for describing turbomachinery performance working with non-perfect gases. The dimensional analysis follows the Rayleigh method and Buckingham-Π theorem. It employs the bulk modulus, the specific gas constant, and the derivative of the compressibility factor regarding pressure at constant entropy. Following a classical analysis from Traupel, this new similarity number is a valuable measure of the non-perfectness of a gas. As an outcome of the present study, it is found that the compressibility factor is not a primary similarity number for non-perfect gas flows. Still, its derivative is part of such a dimensionless number. At least two new similarity numbers are required for describing non-perfect compressible gas flows in addition to the conventional perfect gas similarity numbers. As a limit case of the dimensional analysis, the well-known similarity numbers for a perfect gas result with the isentropic exponent similarity. The theoretical analysis is applied to flow applications utilizing the closed-loop organic vapor wind tunnel test facility CLOWT at Muenster. These applications cover the experimental investigation of the flow of an organic vapor past a circular cylinder and a centrifugal organic vapor compressor's performance. The results of the test cases support the main findings of the dimensional analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3acompressibility 3aenergy 3aentropy 3avapors 3awind tunnels 0aDimensional analysis 0aNon-perfect gas flows 0aPerformance laws 0aTurbomachinery1 aReinker, Felix0 tEnergy.g2022 Oct. 15, v. 257 p.124635-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2022.1246353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02013naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002100153245008300174520080100257592002801058650001001086650001101096650001801107650002101125650001101146650001901157650001801176653002401194653001801218653001701236653002101253653001901274700001901293700002201312700002201334700002201356700002201378773010601400856008801506852000901594655001201603IND60749945920221118230611.0220914e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074994592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.marpolbul.2021.1129232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFujieda, Shigeru10aStanding stock and mass balance of marine litter in the Seto Inland Sea, Japan  aThe basin of Seto Inland Sea has a population of 31 million people.

The mass balance of marine litter was explained by using a single box model, assuming complete mixing and uniform density. If the standing stock of drifting and beach litter combined was 3400 tons, the inflow of litter from rivers was 3000 tons/year, generation of litter at sea was 1200 tons/year, and inflow from the open sea was 300 tons/year. The amount of marine litter removed from the beach and sea surface was 1400 tons/year, outflow to the open sea was 2400 tons/year, and deposition on the sea bottom was 700 tons/year.  aPublisher supplied data 3aJapan 3abasins 3amarine debris 3amarine pollution 3amodels 3aquestionnaires 3arapid methods 0aEnclosed water area 0aMarine litter 0aMass balance 0aRapid assessment 0aStanding stock1 aHoshika, Akira1 aHashimoto, Eisuke1 aSasakura, Satoshi1 aShimizu, Takanori1 aOkumura, Masataka0 tMarine pollution bulletin.g2021 Nov., v. 172 p.112923-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12420x0025-326X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2021.1129233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03027naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245017200159300001600331520183800347592002802185650001102213650001402224650001402238650001702252650002602269650001202295650001302307650001002320650001302330650001402343650001002357650001502367650001202382700001802394700002202412700001902434700001702453773008602470856004002556852000902596655001202605IND50074100520221119202744.0140319e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007410052DNAL7 a10.1111/ibi.120882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoldán, María14aThe vocal begging display of Great Spotted Cuckoo Clamator glandarius nestlings in nests of its two main host species: genetic differences or developmental plasticity?  ap. 867-876.  aThe begging behaviour of nestlings is part of a communication system by which nestlings solicit food from their parents. In the case of brood parasitic species, nestlings in the nests of host species could achieve appropriate begging calls through three different mechanisms: (1) mimicking the host species' begging calls, (2) emitting a begging call that stimulates a wide range of hosts or (3) tuning the begging call in a way that optimizes food provisioning by foster parents. All three mechanisms could occur as a result of post‐hatching environmental factors, or they may be innate when parasitic females specialize on particular host species. In this study we analysed the begging calls of Great Spotted Cuckoo nestlings in nests of its two main hosts, Eurasian Magpie Pica pica and Carrion Crow Corvus corone corone. We did not find support for the previously suggested mimetic call of cuckoo nestlings, as the structure of begging calls did not differ with respect to host species. In addition, the number of notes per call was the only trait of Cuckoo begging calls that differed when parasitizing different host species, but it was in the opposite direction from that of the begging calls of the nestlings of the two host species. Furthermore, cross‐fostering experiments with nestlings that hatched in nests of the two host species yielded calls that did not support the possibility of genetic determination of begging calls of Cuckoos parasitizing different host species (e.g. host species of origin). Moreover, we found a significant effect of the identity of the host species in explaining variation in the number of notes per call. Therefore, our results suggest that Cuckoo nestlings are able to adjust their begging calls after hatching in nests of different host species by learning efficient begging displays.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCorvus 3aCuculidae 3aPica pica 3adead animals 3aenvironmental factors 3afemales 3ahatching 3ahosts 3alearning 3anestlings 3anests 3aparasitism 3aparents1 aSoler, Manuel1 aMárquez, Rafael,1 aSoler, Juan J.1 aBolton, Mark0 tIbis.g2013 Oct., v. 155, no. 4 p.867-876dBlackwell Science Pubx0019-10197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ibi.12088  aDNAL 7aarticle02236naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245008500164300001300249520120500262592002801467650001301495650001601508650001601524650001601540650002301556650001001579650001201589700001701601700001901618700001701637773015301654856008201807852000901889655001201898IND60119301020221120090112.0191003e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011930102DNAL7 a10.1007/s10661-014-4187-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDong, Linyao10aBarometric and tidal-induced aquifer water level fluctuation near the Ariake Sea  ap. 4187.  aObservations of water levels in coastal aquifers and corresponding tides coupled with meteorological variances near the Ariake Sea show that groundwater in this area mainly fluctuates with atmospheric and tidal variations. Tidal effects occur with semi-monthly, diurnal, or semi-diurnal periodicity, whereas the barometric influences commonly act in the low-frequency domain. Tidal and barometric effects in water levels are separable using wavelet techniques and can be evaluated statistically. Results show the following. (1) The tidal coefficients are 0.002–0.154, attenuating roughly exponentially from the seashore. The time lags in water levels increase linearly approximately with increasing inshore distance. Relations between tidal coefficients and time lags and the inshore distance indicate higher hydraulic diffusivity in the south aquifer, which was confirmed by the hydraulic property calibrations in analytical simulations. (2) Water levels related to meteorological phenomena fluctuate inversely according to barometric loading variation with time lags of 2–3 h. The effective barometric efficiencies are 0.022–0.12. Lower barometric influences were found in the south aquifer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3adiffusivity 3agroundwater 3aperiodicity 3atemporal variation 3atides 3awavelet1 aShimada, Jun1 aKagabu, Makoto1 aYang, Heejun0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2015 Jan., v. 187, no. 1 p.4187-4187dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl33242x0167-63697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-014-4187-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02715naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245014100160300001600301520127600317592002801593650004901621650002401670650001001694650002901704650002301733650001901756650001501775650001601790650001101806650001201817650002601829650001401855650001401869650003301883650001301916650003701929650001301966700001401979700001801993700001602011700001702027773011102044856008102155852000902236655001202245IND60081324020221118051342.0150217e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008132402DNAL7 a10.1007/s10658-014-0462-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCai, Jin10aAntibacterial activity of petroleum ether fraction from Laminaria japonica extracts against Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. sepedonicus  ap. 291-300.  aWe prepared an ethanol extract from Laminaria japonica, and obtained five fractions from the extract using various solvents. We investigated the antibacterial activities of the fractions against Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. sepedonicus (Spieckermann & Kotthoff) Davis et al., the causal agent of bacterial ring rot of potato (BRR). Among all the fractions, the petroleum ether fraction showed the strongest (P < 0.05) antibacterial activity against C. michiganensis subsp. sepedonicus. We analyzed the petroleum ether fraction to detect the components with antibacterial activity, and identified 24 compounds. The main constituents of the petroleum ether extract were esters (35.28 %) and acids (44.84 %). Cell membrane permeability assays, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyses revealed that the petroleum ether fraction caused drastic ultrastructural changes in the cells of the pathogen. The petroleum ether fraction caused envelope disruption, cell deformation, the separation of the cell wall from the cell membrane, and the formation of vacuoles. These results clearly indicate that the petroleum ether fraction obtained from L. japonica shows strong antibacterial activity against the causal agent of BRR.  aPublisher supplied data 3aClavibacter michiganensis subsp. sepedonicus 3aSaccharina japonica 3aacids 3aantibacterial properties 3abacterial ring rot 3acell membranes 3acell walls 3adeformation 3aesters 3aethanol 3amembrane permeability 3apathogens 3apetroleum 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asolvents 3atransmission electron microscopy 3avacuoles1 aFeng, Jia1 aWang, Feipeng1 aXu, Qiufeng1 aXie, Shulian0 tEuropean journal of plant pathology.g2014 Oct., v. 140, no. 2 p.291-300dSpringer-Verlagx0929-18737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10658-014-0462-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01333naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245013000154300001800284520024800302592002800550650001200578650001500590650001700605650002100622650001200643700001900655700001700674700001800691700001900709700001600728700002200744773013400766856007400900852000900974655001200983IND60745708620221120092026.0210723e20210722xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074570862DNAL7 a10.1039/d1cc01706c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Yanan10aOne high-nuclearity Eu₁₈ nanoring with rapid ratiometric fluorescence response to dipicolinic acid (an anthrax biomarker)  ap. 7316-7319.  aOne 18-metal Eu(iii) nanoring (size: 1.0 × 2.7 × 2.7 nm) was constructed as a rapid ratiometric fluorescent probe for the detection of dipicolinic acid with high sensitivity and selectivity, by using two types of polydentate organic ligands.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthrax 3abiomarkers 3afluorescence 3afluorescent dyes 3aligands1 aYang, Xiaoping1 aXiao, Zhiyin1 aLiu, Xiaoming1 aShi, Dongliang1 aNiu, Mengyu1 aSchipper, Desmond0 tChemical communications.g2021 July 22, v. 57, no. 59 p.7316-7319dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1cc01706c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02208naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001800153245014100171520102500312592002801337650001301365650002101378650001801399650001701417650001901434650002301453650001501476651002201491653001801513653001301531653002101544653003001565700001901595700001701614773010601631856008801737852000901825655001201834IND60737648620221120220759.0211114e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073764862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.marpolbul.2021.1123622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLutz, Natasha10aAccumulation and potential for transport of microplastics in stormwater drains into marine environments, Perth region, Western Australia  aStormwater drains are important sinks for microplastics and potentially aid the transport of microplastics from terrestrial to marine environments. Samples were collected from sediments in five stormwater drainage systems with different land uses, area, population, and sediment characteristics. Microplastic concentrations within the drainage network varied between 0 and 3500 microplastics per kg of dry sediment, with a mean concentration of 664 particles per kg. The majority of microplastics found were fibres. Polyethylene and polypropylene were the dominant polymer types (μ-FTIR). Based on a Generalized Linear Mixed Model, the expected number of microplastics for a representative urban drain was 760 particles per kg, with 245 particles per kg expected for an agricultural drain. Sediment grain size was a predictor for microplastic abundance, with sandier sediments containing more microplastics. This study is the first to quantify microplastic pollution in stormwater drainage systems in Western Australia.  aPublisher supplied data 3adrainage 3amarine pollution 3amicroplastics 3apolyethylene 3apolypropylenes 3astatistical models 3astormwater 3aWestern Australia 0aMicroplastics 0aSediment 0aStormwater drain 0aCatchment characteristics1 aFogarty, James1 aRate, Andrew0 tMarine pollution bulletin.g2021 July, v. 168 p.112362-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12420x0025-326X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2021.1123623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02230naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001700145245012900162300001600291500002000307520086900327592002801196596007201224596003001296596002101326596002101347596005501368650001301423650001501436650002001451650001701471650001101488650002201499700001801521700001901539700001501558700001901573700001801592773010901610856008001719852000901799655001201808IND60790293620221119025233.0220824e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079029362DNAL7 a10.1002/2211-5463.122302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Danlei10aOxygen binding and nitric oxide dioxygenase activity of cytoglobin are altered to different extents by cysteine modification  ap. 845-853.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aCytoglobin (Cygb), like other members of the globin family, is a nitric oxide (NO) dioxygenase, metabolizing NO in an oxygen (O₂)‐dependent manner. We examined the effect of modification of cysteine sulfhydryl groups of Cygb on its O₂ binding and NO dioxygenase activity. The two cysteine sulfhydryls of Cygb were modified to form either an intramolecular disulfide bond (Cygb_SS), thioether bonds to N‐ethylmaleimide (NEM; Cygb_SC), or were maintained as free SH groups (Cygb_SH). It was observed that the NO dioxygenase activity of Cygb only slightly changed (~ 25%) while the P₅₀ of O₂ binding to Cygb changed over four‐fold with these modifications. Our results suggest that it is possible to separately regulate one Cygb function (such as O₂ binding) without largely affecting the other Cygb functions (such as its NO dioxygenase activity).  aPublisher supplied data  aBridge Funding GrantcThe Ohio State University College of Medicine  cChina Scholarship Council  aR01EB016096cNIH  aR01HL131941cNIH  cDean’s Bridge Grant from OSU College of Medicine 3acysteine 3acytoglobin 3adisulfide bonds 3anitric oxide 3aoxygen 3asulfhydryl groups1 aHemann, Craig1 aBoslett, James1 aLuo, Aiqin1 aZweier, Jay L.1 aLiu, Xiaoping0 tFEBS Open Bio.g2017 June, v. 7, no. 6 p.845-853dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:23386x2211-54637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2211-5463.122303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02067naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245007200163300001600235520089500251592002801146650001401174650001001188650001001198650001001208650001201218650001401230650001401244650001401258650001601272650000901288700002001297700002301317700001901340700002001359700002601379773018201405856007301587852000901660655001201669IND60125930120221117234714.0150428e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012593012DNAL7 a10.1111/bij.124312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodrigues, Clara F.12aA sad tale: has the small mussel Idas argenteus lost its symbionts?  ap. 398-405.  aIdas argenteus (Bivalvia: Mytilidae) belongs to a genus of mussels that are often associated with sunken wood and vertebrate bones in the deep sea. By contrast to other species currently included within the genus Idas and other related genera, such as Bathymodiolus, I. argenteus was documented to lack chemosynthetic symbionts bacterial symbionts in its gills. In the present study, new specimens are assigned to I. argenteus based on shell and soft parts analysis. Molecular data confirm the absence or low abundance of symbionts. Phylogeny based on five genes indicates that the symbiont‐bearing I. washingtonius is the closest relative of I. argenteus. Symbiosis loss or extreme reduction is thus inferred to have occurred subsequent to the speciation event, 11–13 Mya. This is the first report of a loss of symbiosis within the clade of deep‐sea chemosynthetic mussels.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMytilidae 3abones 3agenes 3agills 3amussels 3aphylogeny 3asymbionts 3asymbiosis 3avertebrates 3awood1 aLaming, Sven R.1 aGaudron, Sylvie M.1 aOliver, Graham1 aLe Bris, Nadine1 aDuperron, Sébastien,0 tBiological journal of the Linnean Society.g2015 Feb., v. 114, no. 2 p.398-405dPublished for the Linnean Society of London by Blackwell [etc.]wJournal:jnl1847x0024-40667nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/bij.124313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03034naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002700151245015100178300001600329500001500345520144600360592002801806650002101834650003701855650004301892650002801935650002201963650001401985650002301999650002302022651001102045653002402056653002002080653002802100653001502128653001802143653001602161700001702177700002102194700001902215700002302234700002002257700002902277700002602306773011302332856008602445852000902531655001202540IND50060489420221119132025.0190408e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006048942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.indcrop.2012.11.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarros, Francisco M.C.10aAntifungal and antichemotactic activities and quantification of phenolic compounds in lipophilic extracts of Hypericum spp. native to South Brazil  ap. 294-299.  a2019-12-06  aPlants of the Hypericum genus are a notable source of new therapeutic agents including antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory. This study reports the antifungal and antichemotactic activities of the lipophilic extracts of five Hypericum species (H. caprifoliatum Cham. & Schlecht., H. carinatum Griseb., H. linoides A. St.-Hil., H. myrianthum Cham. & Schlecht. and H. polyanthemum Klotzsch ex Reichardt) native to South Brazil. Tests were performed using the broth microdilution assay against 10 species of pathogenic yeasts and neutrophils migration inhibition method, respectively. All samples exhibited a broad spectrum of antifungal action as well as reduced neutrophils migration. H. carinatum, H. linoides and H. myrianthum extracts presented the lowest value of minimum inhibitory concentration against Cryptococcus neoformans (MIC≤15.6μg/mL), Rhodotorula mucilaginosa (MIC≤62.5μg/mL), Candida glabrata and Candida tropicalis (MIC range=1.9–250μg/mL). The antichemotactic effect varied from 60 to 100% at concentrations of 0.31–10.0μg/mL. The results of analyses by HPLC demonstrated a strong correlation between the phenolic compounds and the antifungal/anti-inflammatory activities. The extracts that presented high amounts of the dimeric phloroglucinol uliginosin B, japonicin A and hyperbrasilol B were the most active. Thus, Hypericum extracts show potential as source of new anti-infectives and anti-inflammatory drugs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCandida glabrata 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aCryptococcus neoformans 3aRhodotorula rubra 3aHypericum 3aCandida tropicalis 3aphenolic compounds 3aBrazil 0aTorulopsis glabrata 0aAntichemotactic 0aDimeric phloroglucinols 0aAntifungal 0aBenzophenones 0aBenzopyrans1 aPippi, Bruna1 aDresch, Roger R.1 aDauber, Betina1 aLuciano, Suelen C.1 aApel, Miriam A.1 aFuentefria, Alexandre M.1 avon Poser, Gilsane L.0 tIndustrial crops and products.g2013 Jan., v. 44 p.294-299dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49222x0926-66907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2012.11.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03720naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004700113040001800160100002000178245012700198300001600325520177200341592002802113650001202141650002002153650001602173650001702189650001902206650001802225650004302243650001302286650003102299650002102330650000902351650006502360650003502425650002402460650003002484650002802514650001102542650001102553650000902564650001602573650007002589650007102659650004202730650005002772650002202822700001502844700001802859700001202877700002002889773009602909856009303005990002303098852000903121655001203130IND60088889420221122054832.0141102e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008888942DNAL7 a220152322pmid7 a10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2011.09.0482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGeng, Deng-feng10aEffect of cilostazol on the progression of carotid intima-media thickness: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials  ap. 177-183.  aBACKGROUND: It has been well established that cilostazol has anti-proliferative effect against in-stent restenosis. However, it remains unclear whether cilostazol can prevent the progression of carotid atherosclerosis. METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed a meta-analysis of all relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to evaluate the effect of cilostazol on the progression of carotid intima-media thickness (IMT). Five RCTs with 698 patients [597 subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)] were included in this study. Cilostazol was associated with a significant reduction in the progression of carotid IMT (WMD, −0.08mm, 95% CI −0.13, −0.04; P=0.00003). Subgroup analysis shows that cilostazol monotherapy or addition to dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin and clopidogrel) was superior to placebo (WMD, −0.04mm, 95% CI −0.05, −0.03; P<0.00001), no antiplatelet medication (WMD, −0.12mm, 95% CI −0.21, −0.03; P=0.008), aspirin monotherapy (WMD, −0.06mm, 95% CI −0.12, 0.00; P=0.04) or dual antiplatelet therapy (WMD, −0.16mm, 95% CI −0.30, −0.02; P=0.03) in preventing the progression of carotid IMT. Cilostazol resulted in a significant decrease in total cholesterol (WMD −8.47mg/dl, 95% CI −14.18, −2.75; P=0.004) and LDL-C (WMD −8.25mg/dl, 95% CI −14.15, −2.36; P=0.006) and favorable trends in reducing triglyceride (WMD −15.83mg/dl, 95% CI −32.14, 0.48; P=0.06). CONCLUSION: It suggests that cilostazol may have beneficial effects in preventing the progression of carotid atherosclerosis and improving pro-atherogenic lipid profile, especially in patients with T2DM. Whether the anti-atherosclerotic effect of cilostazol is independent of improving pro-atherogenic dyslipidemia is worth further investigation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaspirin 3aatherosclerosis 3acholesterol 3adrug therapy 3ahyperlipidemia 3ameta-analysis 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3apatients 3arandomized clinical trials 3atriacylglycerols 2aAged 2aCarotid Artery Diseasesxdiagnosisxdrug therapyxpathology. 2aCarotid Intima-Media Thickness 2aDisease Progression 2aDrug Therapy, Combination 2aEvidence-Based Medicine 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aPhosphodiesterase 3 Inhibitorsxadverse effectsxtherapeutic use. 2aPlatelet Aggregation Inhibitorsxadverse effectsxtherapeutic use. 2aRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic 2aTetrazolesxadverse effectsxtherapeutic use. 2aTreatment Outcome1 aDeng, Jing1 aJin, Dong-mei1 aWu, Wei1 aWang, Jing-feng0 tAtherosclerosis.g2012 Jan., v. 220, no. 1 p.177-183dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0021-91507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2011.09.0483Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02992naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245014200163300001600305520166000321592002801981650001802009650001002027650001002037650001802047650001302065650001002078650001102088650002202099650002502121650001202146650001602158700002002174700002602194700002602220700001702246700001802263700002502281773018202306856007302488852000902561655001202570IND60125930320221117234634.0150428e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012593032DNAL7 a10.1111/bij.124282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCornuault, Josselin10aMorphological and plumage colour variation in the Réunion grey white‐eye (Aves: Zosterops borbonicus): assessing the role of selection  ap. 459-473.  aThe Réunion grey white‐eye (Zosterops borbonicus), a small passerine endemic to the island of Réunion (Mascarene archipelago), constitutes an extraordinary case of phenotypic variation within a bird species, with conspicuous plumage colour differentiation at a microgeographical scale. To understand whether natural selection could explain such variability, we compared patterns of variation in morphological and plumage colour traits within and among populations. To quantify morphological variation, we used measurements obtained by Frank Gill in the 1960s from 239 individuals collected in 60 localities distributed over the entire island of Réunion. To quantify colour variation, we measured the reflectance spectra of plumage patches of 50 males from a subset of Gill's specimens belonging to the five recognized plumage colour variants and used a visual model to project these colours in an avian‐appropriate, tetrachromatic, colour space. We found that variants occupy different regions of the avian colour space and that between‐variant differences for most plumage patches could be discriminated by the birds. Differences in morphology were also detected, but these were, in general, smaller than colour differences. Overall, we found that variation in both plumage colour and morphology among variants is greater than would be expected if genetic drift alone was responsible for phenotypic divergence. As the plumage colour variants correspond to four geographical forms, our results suggest that phenotypic evolution in the Réunion grey white‐eye is at least partly explained by divergent selection in different habitats or regions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPasseriformes 3abirds 3acolor 3agenetic drift 3ahabitats 3amales 3amodels 3anatural selection 3aphenotypic variation 3aplumage 3areflectance1 aDelahaie, Boris1 aBertrand, Joris A.

Aiming to demonstrate the monitoring potential of radar satellites in the mining sector, we analyze the deformation field in the Riotinto mine, Spain. We propose a new method for combining ascending and descending results into a common dataset that provides better resolution. We project the LOS measurements resulting from both geometries to a common reference system without applying any type of geometric restriction. As a projection system, we use the vertical direction in flat areas and the slope in steep topographies. We then identify and remove outliers and artifacts from the joint dataset to finally obtain a deformation map that combines the two acquisition perspectives. The results in the Atalaya pit are consistent with GNSS measurements. The movements observed in the rock dumps were unknown before this study. We demonstrate the great potential of the Sentinel-1 satellite as a complementary tool for monitoring systems in mining environments and we call for its use to be standardized to guarantee a safe and sustainable supply of mineral resources necessary for a just technological transition.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3adata collection 3adeformation 3ageometry 3ainterferometry 3aradar 3asatellites 3asoil 3aSpain1 aMarzan, Ignacio 1 aMartí, David 1 aTornos, Fernando 1 aFarci, Angelo 1 aSchimmel, Martin 1 aCarbonell, Ramon 1 aFernández, José 0 tRemote Sensing.g2022 June 25, v. 14, no. 13dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs141330613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02419naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245010000169300001400269520133400283592002801617650002101645650004301666650002401709650002201733650001301755651001201768651001801780651001101798651001901809700002101828700001901849773011101868856008101979852000902060655001202069IND60478664520221118130947.0160113e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047866452DNAL7 a10.1007/s10530-015-0987-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDieni, Alessandro10aReconstructing the invasion history of the lily leaf beetle, Lilioceris lilii, in North America  ap. 31-44.  aIdentifying routes of invasions of exotic organisms is an essential step to prevent further introductions and to manage established populations. The invasion of North America by the lily leaf beetle (Lilioceris lilii) is well documented, but the source(s) of the introduced population(s) and the geographical pathway(s) followed by the beetle during its progression in North America remain unknown. We used amplified fragment length polymorphism to characterize the genotype of 516 individuals across 25 locations in North America and 9 locations in Europe. Genetic clustering analyses and principal coordinate analyses revealed clear genetic differences between individuals from Canada and the USA, suggesting two different episodes of introduction in North America, a first one in Montréal, QC, Canada, in 1943 and a second one in Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States of America, in 1992. Population allocation analyses further suggested that the invasive populations of L. lilii originated from northern Europe, probably in southern United Kingdom and the western part of Germany. Finally, dates of first mentions of the beetle across North America, paired with the genetic diversity of the beetles at each location, showed that there are two separate routes of invasion of L. lilii with distinctive patterns of dispersal.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLilioceris lilii 3aamplified fragment length polymorphism 3aecological invasion 3agenetic variation 3agenotype 3aGermany 3aMassachusetts 3aQuebec 3aUnited Kingdom1 aBrodeur, Jacques1 aTurgeon, Julie0 tBiological invasions.g2016 Jan., v. 18, no. 1 p.31-44dSpringer International Publishingx1387-35477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-015-0987-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02799naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245008900161300001600250520147100266592002801737650002701765650000801792650001101800650001601811650001201827650001701839650000901856650001001865650002701875650001201902650001301914650001401927650002101941651001601962700002201978700002302000700002302023700001902046700002402065773018202089856007302271852000902344655001202353IND60125930520221117234624.0150428e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012593052DNAL7 a10.1111/bij.124342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLevine, Brenna A.10aBateman–Trivers in the 21st Century: sexual selection in a North American pitviper  ap. 436-445.  aAssessment of sexual selection in organisms with cryptic life histories is challenging, although accurate parentage assignments using genotypic markers, combined with behavioural observations and a method to account for open population bias, allow for robust estimation of metrics. In the present study, we employed 22 tetranucleotide microsatellite DNA loci to interpret mating and reproductive success in a population of Copperhead (Viperidae, Agkistrodon contortrix) in Connecticut, USA. We sampled DNA from 114 adults (56 males, 58 females) and 137 neonates from known mothers to quantify Bateman gradients (βₛₛ), as well as sex‐specific opportunities for selection (I) and sexual selection (Iₛ). We also estimated selection on male size [snout‐to‐vent length (SVL)], a trait important for successful combat and subsequent copulations. Estimates of male I and Iₛdiffered significantly from those of females when estimated with four different methods and only males had a significant Bateman gradient. As predicted, male reproductive success was positively correlated with increasing SVL. These results contrast with those derived in another study investigating the same population but based solely on observational data and without correction for open population bias. We thus argue that molecular approaches to quantifying reproductive success and strength of sexual selection provide more accurate results than do behavioural observations alone.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgkistrodon contortrix 3aDNA 3aadults 3acorrelation 3afemales 3alife history 3aloci 3amales 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amothers 3aneonates 3aparentage 3asexual selection 3aConnecticut1 aSmith, Charles F.1 aSchuett, Gordon W.1 aDouglas, Marlis R.1 aDavis, Mark A.1 aDouglas, Michael E.0 tBiological journal of the Linnean Society.g2015 Feb., v. 114, no. 2 p.436-445dPublished for the Linnean Society of London by Blackwell [etc.]wJournal:jnl1847x0024-40667nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/bij.124343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02550naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245012500158300002000283520121900303592002801522650004401550650002301594650003701617650002801654650001901682650001601701650001301717650001901730650001301749650001501762650001301777650003801790650003701828700001201865700001501877700001401892700001501906773012401921856007402045852000902119655001202128IND60664142020221121014315.0190910e20121015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066414202DNAL7 a10.1039/c2ra21316h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZheng, Xiaoli10aHigh-throughput, direct exfoliation of graphite to graphene via a cooperation of supercritical CO₂ and pyrene-polymers  ap. 10632-10638.  aA facile and green approach has been developed using supercritical CO₂ as penetrant, expanding agent and antisolvent, and pyrene-polymers as a molecular wedge and modifier, leading to high-throughput graphene dispersions. Herein, two specially designed pyrene-polymers with a large planar aromatic group and two substituted polymer dangling chains have been employed to stabilize the graphene sheets, which show excellent solubility in aqueous and organic solvents. The morphology and quality of the exfoliated graphene sheets are studied by transmission electron microscope (TEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), Raman, FTIR, and wide-scanning X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), which reveal that large scale and high quality graphene flakes are obtained by the facile process. The supercritical CO₂, pyrene-polymers and the solvent system have a significant influence on the exfoliation results. The pyrene-polymers attached to the graphene can further integrate graphene with other polymers to form new functional nanocomposites. This solution-based method combines high-throughput production and functionalization of graphene in one step, providing nanoscale building blocks for practical applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aatomic force microscopy 3acarbon dioxide 3adispersions 3agraphene 3ananocomposites 3apolymers 3asolubility 3asolvents 3atransmission electron microscopes 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aXu, Qun1 aLi, Jianbo1 aLi, Lihua1 aWei, Junyi0 tRSC advances.g2012 Oct. 15, v. 2, no. 28 p.10632-10638dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c2ra21316h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02517naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092040001800122100001800140245008400158300001800242500002400260520154000284650001201824650001101836650001601847650001001863650001601873651001601889700001401905700001901919700002101938700002301959773011101982852000902093856007702102655001202179IND4463897020221119210948.0120817e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446389702DNAL7 a10.2136/vzj2011.01132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aClose, Murray12aA Novel Method for Sampling and Characterizing Unconsolidated Deep Vadose Zones  ap. 1976-1982.  aIncludes references  aThis technical note describes a novel large diameter vadose zone sampler (VZS) that has been developed to permit easy and safe access to deep unconsolidated vadose zone profiles and the gathering of information that has not been possible previously. The purpose is to allow investigations to be performed cost effectively at locations of interest rather than being restricted to areas with suitable exposures. The VZS is designed to be used with 1.2-m-diameter auger holes and consists of a light-weight crane and several 1.15-m-diameter, 1.5-m-high, cylindrical steel sections, which bolt together to provide a temporary casing for the auger hole. The sections have removable openings to permit examination and sampling of the vadose zone profile. The VZS is relatively inexpensive to construct and has been designed to be mobile and provide access to the vadose zone at a wide range of locations, rather than the usual restriction to available outcrops in cuttings or gravel pits. We describe the use of the VZS to characterize the profile of an alluvial gravel system at four locations in Canterbury, New Zealand and to carry out a field calibration for a neutron probe that had been installed to a depth of 3 m into an alluvial gravel profile. The VZS enabled collection of samples for physical, chemical, and gravimetric moisture determination at precise depth locations. This information will ultimately lead to better characterization and understanding of water and contaminant transport and transformation through vadose zones. 3abolting 3agravel 3amethodology 3asteel 3avadose zone 3aNew Zealand1 aDann, Rod1 aFlintoft, Mark1 aHavelaar, Pieter1 aPeterson, Michelle0 tVadose zone journal.g2012 May, v. 11, no. 2 p.1976-1982dSoil Science Society of Americax1539-16637nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/vzj2011.01133Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03132naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245011100169300001600280500001500296520164500311592002801956650001601984650002202000650002802022650003402050650001802084650004302102650003302145650004402178650002002222650001302242650002502255650002002280650002302300653002502323653001902348653001702367700001802384700001502402700001702417700001702434773011602451856008602567852000902653655001202662IND60551851920221121124959.0170124e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055185192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2014.07.0562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKan, Yongjun10aAntioxidant activity of polysaccharide extracted from Ganoderma lucidum using response surface methodology  ap. 151-157.  a2019-12-06  aSuperfine grinding technology was applied for polysaccharide extraction from the fruiting bodies of Ganoderma lucidum, and response surface methodology (RSM) was used to optimize the effects of processing parameters on polysaccharide extraction yield. Results showed that the maximum yield of G. lucidum polysaccharides (GLP) was obtained at an optimum condition: extraction time 137min, extraction temperature 66 ̊C, the ratio of water to material 35mL/g, and the GLP extracting yield reached 2.44% under this condition. GLP were precipitated into three crude polysaccharides, viz. GLP40, GLP60 and GLP80. The basic characterization of polysaccharides was determined by using HPLC and FT-IR methods. GLP, GLP80, GLP60, and GLP40 were composed of Man, Rib, Glc, Gal and Fuc with the molar ratios of 1.27:0.36:22.89:1.61:0.33, 1.40:0.31:23.02:3.46:0.91, 0.96:0.34:25.76:2.47:0.46, and 2.81:1.42:23.83:1.61:0.33, respectively. The result of FT-IR suggested that the monosaccharide residue of the four polysaccharides was β-pyranoid ring. Moreover, the antioxidant activities of these four polysaccharides were evaluated. The results showed that GLP80 had the best reducing power, DPPH radical scavenging ability and oxygen radical scavenging ability followed by GLP, GLP60 and GLP40. Our results demonstrated that RSM might be a valuable technique for optimizing the efficient extraction of GLP, and G. lucidum could be considered as sources of natural antioxidants and preservatives of food industry. Moreover, polysaccharides, especially GLP80, extracted from the fruiting bodies of G. lucidum, exhibited promising antioxidant activities.  aPublisher supplied data 3atemperature 3aGanoderma lucidum 3areactive oxygen species 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3afood industry 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aresponse surface methodology 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3apolysaccharides 3agrinding 3aantioxidant activity 3afruiting bodies 3afood preservatives 0aAntioxidant activity 0aPolysaccharide 0aantioxidants1 aChen, Tiqiang1 aWu, Yanbin1 aWu, Jianguo,1 aWu, Jinzhong0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2015 Jan., v. 72 p.151-157dElsevier B.V.x0141-81307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2014.07.0563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04086naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002000153245012300173300001600296520223600312592002802548650001002576650002002586650003902606650001602645650002002661650002102681650002102702650001902723650001302742650001102755650002102766650002302787650001002810650001202820650001302832650001502845650001702860650001802877650002302895650001202918650001002930653001902940653002402959653002402983653002103007653001003028653001003038700002303048700001903071700002103090700001803111700002303129700002003152700002103172700002403193700002103217773010203238856008703340852000903427655001203436IND60545622420221122182134.0160902e20141015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054562242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2014.07.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPetro, Evi M.L.10aPerfluoroalkyl acid contamination of follicular fluid and its consequence for in vitro oocyte developmental competence  ap. 282-288.  aPerfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) have been shown to induce negative effects in laboratory animals and in vitro experiments. Also, PFAAs have been detected in human tissues and body fluids. The ovarian follicle constitutes a fragile micro-environment where interactions between hormones, growth factors, the oocyte and surrounding somatic cells are essential to generate a fully competent oocyte. In vitro experiments suggest that PFAAs can influence this balance, but very scarce in vivo data are available to confirm this assumption. In fact, the potential PFAA-presence in the follicular micro-environment is currently unknown.Therefore, we investigated if PFAAs are present in human follicular fluid and if their presence could be a risk factor for in vivo exposed developing oocytes. Furthermore, we compared the PFAA-distribution within serum and follicular fluid.PFAAs were analyzed by LC/MS in follicular fluid (n=38) and serum (n=20) samples from women undergoing assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs). Statistical models were used to investigate PFAA-distribution in both body fluids, to compare this behavior with the distribution of lipophilic organic pollutants and to explore the relationship between patient characteristics, ART-results and follicular fluid contamination.Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) was the PFAA found in the highest concentration in follicular fluid [7.5 (0.1–30.4) ng/mL] and serum [7.6 (2.8–12.5) ng/mL]. A new variable, Principal Component 1, representing the overall PFAA-contamination of the follicular fluid samples, was associated with a higher fertilization rate (p<0.05) and a higher proportion of top embryos relative to the amount of retrieved oocytes (p<0.05), after adjusting for age, estradiol-concentration, BMI, male subfertility and the presence of other organic pollutants as explanatory variables.To conclude, overall higher PFAA-contamination in the follicular micro-environment was associated with a higher chance of an oocyte to develop into a high quality embryo. Also, PFAAs have different distribution patterns between serum and follicular fluid compared to the lipophilic organic pollutants. Further research is of course crucial to confirm these new observations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacids 3aadverse effects 3aassisted reproductive technologies 3ablood serum 3abody mass index 3afertilizer rates 3afollicular fluid 3agrowth factors 3ahormones 3ahumans 3ain vitro studies 3alaboratory animals 3amales 3aoocytes 3apatients 3apollutants 3arisk factors 3asomatic cells 3astatistical models 3atissues 3awomen 0aEmbryo quality 0aEndocrine disruptor 0aFemale subfertility 0aFollicular fluid 0aPFAAs 0aSerum1 aD'Hollander, Wendy1 aCovaci, Adrian1 aBervoets, Lieven1 aFransen, Erik1 aDe Neubourg, Diane1 aDe Pauw, Ingrid1 aLeroy, Jo L.M.R.1 aJorssen, Ellen P.A.1 aBols, Peter E.J.0 tScience of the total environment.g2014 Oct. 15, v. 496 p.282-288dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2014.07.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02981naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002900166245016100195300001600356520140900372592002801781650002201809650002801831650001501859650001101874650003901885650002501924650001001949650001001959650001401969650001401983650001501997650001702012650001702029650001302046650005202059650002202111650001102133650003702144700002602181700001702207700002802224700001602252700001802268773009902286856008102385852000902466655001202475IND60080107920221120180230.0140728e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008010792DNAL7 a248032382pmid7 a10.1007/s10482-014-0181-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSathishkumar, Yesupatham10aEffect of low shear modeled microgravity on phenotypic and central chitin metabolism in the filamentous fungi Aspergillus niger and Penicillium chrysogenum   ap. 197-209.  aPhenotypic and genotypic changes in Aspergillus niger and Penicillium chrysogenum, spore forming filamentous fungi, with respect to central chitin metabolism were studied under low shear modeled microgravity, normal gravity and static conditions. Low shear modeled microgravity (LSMMG) response showed a similar spore germination rate with normal gravity and static conditions. Interestingly, high ratio of multiple germ tube formation of A. niger in LSMMG condition was observed. Confocal laser scanning microscopy images of calcofluor flurophore stained A. niger and P. chrysogenum showed no significant variations between different conditions tested. Transmission electron microscopy images revealed number of mitochondria increased in P. chrysogenum in low shear modeled microgravity condition but no stress related-woronin bodies in fungal hyphae were observed. To gain additional insight into the cell wall integrity under different conditions, transcription level of a key gene involved in cell wall integrity gfaA, encoding the glutamine: fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase enzyme, was evaluated using qRT-PCR. The transcription level showed no variation among different conditions. Overall, the results collectively indicate that the LSMMG has shown no significant stress on spore germination, mycelial growth, cell wall integrity of potentially pathogenic fungi, A. niger and P. chrysogenum.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus niger 3aPenicillium chrysogenum 3acell walls 3achitin 3aconfocal laser scanning microscopy 3afructose 6-phosphate 3afungi 3agenes 3agerm tube 3aglutamine 3ametabolism 3amicrogravity 3amitochondria 3amycelium 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3aspore germination 3aspores 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aVelmurugan, Natarajan1 aLee, Hyun Mi1 aRajagopal, Kalyanaraman1 aIm, Chan Ki1 aLee, Yang Soo0 tAntonie van Leeuwenhoek.g2014 Aug., v. 106, no. 2 p.197-209dSpringer-Verlagx0003-60727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10482-014-0181-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02863naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002400140245008500164500001900249500002000268520167800288592002801966596007801994650002002072650001202092650001702104650001702121650001002138650001602148651001102164651001202175700001502187700001802202700005902220773012702279856007402406852000902480655001202489IND60733248320221119215814.0210405e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073324832DNAL7 a10.1111/joss.126392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThibodeau, Margaret10aEnglish version of the food disgust scale: Optimization and other considerations  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe disgust elicited by food plays an important role in food choice and consumption. Recently, Hartmann and Siegrist (Food Quality and Preference, 2018, 63, 38–50) developed and validated in German the food disgust scale (FDS), a 32‐item instrument designed to measure visceral disgust elicited by food. In Study 1, we tested the English language translation of the FDS and its shortened version (FDS‐SHORT) in England (n = 85) and Canada (n = 70). The internal reliability (Cronbach's alpha and mean interitem correlation [MCI]) was acceptable for both the FDS (α = .90, MIC = .22) and the FDS‐SHORT (α = .73, MIC = .25). Exploratory factor analysis revealed that the English and German versions of the FDS had similar underlying structure and good discriminant validity. In Study 2, female participants (n = 159) who completed the FDS where the anchor term disgusted was used had higher FDS‐SHORT scores than either their male counterparts or females for whom the anchor term grossed out was used (F[2, 266] = 11.1, p < .001). As grossed out captures only visceral rather than moral disgust, we recommend its adoption in English versions of these scales. These studies confirm that, as modified, the English FDS and FDS‐SHORT are reliable and can be used with confidence in future research. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: This study has further assessed and optimized an English translation of the food disgust scale, which will allow for its use by food researchers and practitioners in English‐speaking countries. The finding that food disgust scores vary with sex and culture provides guidance to producers and marketers of novel food products and flavors.  aPublisher supplied data  aDiscovery Grant to GPcNatural Sciences and Engineering Council of Canada 3afactor analysis 3afemales 3afood choices 3afood quality 3amales 3anovel foods 3aCanada 3aEngland1 aYang, Qian1 aFord, Rebecca1 aPickering, Gary1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5104-49680 tJournal of sensory studies.g2021 Apr., v. 36, no. 2 p.e12639-dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl66238x0887-82507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/joss.126393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03388naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245017400164520175600338592002802094650002802122650003402150650000802184650002502192650001902217650001802236650002002254650000902274650001402283650004202297650001602339650002002355650002402375650001702399650002902416650002602445653000902471653002102480653002402501653000902525700001402534700001902548700001502567700001302582700001802595700001902613700001902632773011602651856008202767852000902849655001202858IND60710814320221119075626.0220103e20210130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071081432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jep.2020.1133892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGong, Guowei10aAstragaloside IV, a saponin from Astragalus membranaceus var. mongholicus, induces expressions of heme recycle proteins via signaling of Nrf2/ARE in cultured macrophages  aIn traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) theory, “Qi” is classified as energetic essence supporting the life activities in human. “Blood” is categorized as nourishing essence and circulating in the body. “Blood” and “Qi” have an intimate relationship. Astragali Radix (AR; root of Astragalus membranaceus (Fisch.) Bge. Var. mongholicus (Bge.) Hsiao) has a broad spectrum of application for “Qi-Blood” enrichment. Astragaloside IV, a major saponin in AR, has therapeutic functions in erythropoietic, cardiovascular and immune systems. However, the efficacy of astragaloside IV in erythrophagocytosis has not been elucidated.The possible functions of astragaloside IV in heme iron recycling during erythrophagocytosis in cultured macrophage were elucidated.The translational and transcriptional expressions of heme recycling enzymes were determined after incubating of astragaloside IV for 24 h in cultured macrophage.In astragaloside IV-treated macrophage, the expressions, both RNA and protein levels, of regulators of heme recycling, e.g. heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), ferroportin (FPN), biliverdin reductase A and B (BVRA, BVRB), were markedly induced in dose-dependent manners. In parallel, the transcriptional activity of antioxidant response element, cloned within an expression vector as pARE-Luc and transfected in cultured macrophages, was markedly induced after a challenge with astragaloside IV in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, the translocation of Nrf2, a transcriptional factor in regulating expression of heme recycling protein, was induced by astragaloside IV, leading to an enrichment at nucleus fraction.Astragaloside IV shed lights in enhancing the expression of heme recycle proteins via Nrf2/ARE signaling pathway.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAstragalus membranaceus 3aOriental traditional medicine 3aRNA 3aantioxidant activity 3aastragalosides 3adose response 3agenetic vectors 3aheme 3aheme iron 3aheme oxygenase (biliverdin-producing) 3amacrophages 3aprotein content 3asignal transduction 3atherapeutics 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 0aHeme 0aAstragaloside IV 0aErythrophagocytosis 0aNrf21 aYu, Huiru1 aZheng, Yuzhong1 aQi, Baohui1 aHe, Huan1 aYin, Tianpeng1 aDong, Tina TX.1 aTsim, Karl WK.0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2021 Jan. 30, v. 265 p.113389-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl30651x0378-87417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2020.1133893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02565naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245010900158300001600267520132600283592002801609650001801637650001201655650001601667650000901683650000901692650001801701650001401719650000901733650002801742650001001770650001401780650000901794650001101803650000901814650001901823651001801842700001901860773018201879856007302061852000902134655001202143IND60125930820221117234812.0150428e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012593082DNAL7 a10.1111/bij.124222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGoiran, Claire10aParental defence on the reef: antipredator tactics of coral‐reef fishes against egg‐eating seasnakes  ap. 415-425.  aOn coral reefs in New Caledonia, the eggs of demersal‐spawning fishes are consumed by turtle‐headed seasnakes (Emydocephalus annulatus). Fish repel nest‐raiding snakes by a series of tactics. We recorded 232 cases (involving 22 fish species) of antipredator behaviour towards snakes on a reef near Noumea. Blennies and gobies focused their attacks on snakes entering their nests, whereas damselfish (Pomacentridae) attacked passing snakes, as well as nest‐raiders (reflecting territorial defence). Biting the snake was the most common form of attack, although damselfish and blennies also slapped snakes with the tail, or (blennies only) plugged the nest entrance with the parent fish's body. Gobies rarely defended the nest, although they sometimes bit or threw sand at the snake. A snake was more likely to flee if it was attacked before it began feeding rather than after it found the eggs (82% versus 3% repelled) and if bitten on the head rather than the body (68% versus 53%). Tail‐slaps were not effective, although plugging the burrow and throwing sand often caused snakes to flee. These strong patterns reflect phylogenetic variation in fish behaviour (e.g. damselfish detect a snake approach sooner than do substrate‐dwelling blennies and gobies) coupled with intraspecific variation in snake diets.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPomacentridae 3aburrows 3acoral reefs 3adiet 3afish 3afish behavior 3afish eggs 3ahead 3aintraspecific variation 3anests 3aphylogeny 3asand 3asnakes 3atail 3aterritoriality 3aNew Caledonia1 aShine, Richard0 tBiological journal of the Linnean Society.g2015 Feb., v. 114, no. 2 p.415-425dPublished for the Linnean Society of London by Blackwell [etc.]wJournal:jnl1847x0024-40667nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/bij.124223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02109naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245013500167300001200302520100900314592002801323650001901351650002401370650002201394650001201416650001301428650002301441650002101464650000901485700002301494700001801517700002501535773010901560856008101669852000901750655001201759IND60478665120221118130943.0160113e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047866512DNAL7 a10.1007/s10530-015-0999-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSitzia, Tommaso10aUsing forest management to control invasive alien species: helping implement the new European regulation on invasive alien species  ap. 1-7.  aOn 1 January 2015 a new European regulation on invasive alien species entered in force. Key aspects of this regulation are the adoption of a list of invasive alien species which are of European Union concern, the requirement for specific prevention measures, the establishment of early detection and fast eradication measures, and the management of the widely spread invasive alien species. We highlight the potential contribution of the forestry sector to promote the implementation of this regulation. There is a wealth of experience on positive and negative responses of invasive alien species to forestry interventions. This knowledge should be synthesized and further developed to help prevent and manage invasions in forests and adjacent habitats and to minimize the risks of invasive alien species. We thus recommend that decisions regarding the application of the regulation will include actors responsible for, or involved in, the management and use of forests and related semi-natural habitats.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3aecological invasion 3aforest management 3aforests 3ahabitats 3aintroduced species 3ainvasive species 3arisk1 aCampagnaro, Thomas1 aKowarik, Ingo1 aTrentanovi, Giovanni0 tBiological invasions.g2016 Jan., v. 18, no. 1 p.1-7dSpringer International Publishingx1387-35477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-015-0999-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02186naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002200166245011300188300001600301520106000317592002801377650002901405650001001434650002701444650002301471650002201494650003301516650001601549650001101565651002101576700001801597700002001615773009901635856008101734852000901815655001201824IND60080108120221120190044.0150216e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008010812DNAL7 a248196892pmid7 a10.1007/s10482-014-0183-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBhuiyan, Mohammad10aGas chromatography–mass spectrometry analysis of fatty acid profiles of Antarctic and non-Antarctic yeasts  ap. 381-389.  aThe fatty acid profiles of Antarctic (n = 7) and non-Antarctic yeasts (n = 7) grown at different temperatures were analysed by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry.

However, the mechanism underlying its efficacy remains unexplored.This study aims to elucidate the underlying mechanisms, explore potential pathways, and identify the key proteins of JZF for the treatment of dyslipidemia.In this work, Q-Orbitrap high-resolution liquid chromatography mass spectrometry was used to identify the natural ingredients in JZF, rats with dyslipidemia were established via a high-fat diet for four weeks, then the dyslipidemia rats were treated with high-dose JZF (9 g/d) and low-dose JZF (4.5 g/d) for four weeks. After treatment, serum lipid detection and Oil-red-O staining were conducted to assess the efficacy of JZF in ameliorating dyslipidemia. Tandem mass tag (TMT) -based quantitative proteomics technology was then used to evaluate the roles and importance of proteins from the extracted hepatic tissue. The differentially expressed proteins were assessed by Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways, Gene Ontology (GO), and protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks. Western blot and PCR analysis were used to validate the potential targets regulated by JZF.JZF could significantly improve the blood lipid profiles of serum and fat deposits of the liver. A total of 123 differentially expressed proteins were detected after JZF intervention, comprising 65 up-regulated proteins and 58 down-regulated proteins. The KEGG pathway analysis revealed that cholesterol metabolism, the PPAR signaling pathway, and bile secretion were the principal pathways involved in the disordered lipid metabolism, while GO analysis suggested that proteins that are located in the cell, regulate cellular processes, and show binding activity contribute to reductions in lipids. The combination of proteomics, Western blot, and PCR suggested that Apolipoprotein B (APOB), Apolipoprotein E (APOE), cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase A1 (CYP7A1), and Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase 1 (HMGCS1) might play critical roles in JZF's lipid-lowering network.JZF can effectively improve lipid profiles via multiple pathways involved in cholesterol metabolism, the PPAR signaling pathway, and bile secretion. Generally, the proteomics techniques used in this research show that JZF could be a promising drug for the treatment of dyslipidemia.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern blotting 3aapolipoprotein B 3aapolipoprotein E 3abile secretion 3ablood lipids 3ablood serum 3acholesterol 3acholesterol metabolism 3adrugs 3agene expression regulation 3agene ontology 3agenes 3ahigh fat diet 3ahydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase 3ahyperlipidemia 3alipid composition 3aliquid chromatography 3aliver 3amass spectrometry 3aperoxisome proliferator-activated receptors 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aprotein synthesis 3aprotein-protein interactions 3aproteomics 3arats 3asignal transduction 3astaining 3atraditional medicine 0aJiangzhuo formula 0aDyslipidemia 0aTMT-based proteomics 0aTraditional Chinese medicine1 aTian, Yuan1 aSun, Haiyang1 aWang, Yao1 aLiu, Guirong0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2021 Jan. 10, v. 264 p.113390-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl30651x0378-87417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2020.1133903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02056naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245011400164520082200278592002801100650001301128650002001141650003001161650001301191650002101204650001401225650001101239650001601250653002101266653003001287653001601317653001301333700001801346700001301364700001601377700002301393700001401416773012401430856008301554852000901637655001201646IND60777407820221120220314.0220628e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077740782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jaap.2022.1055622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHao, Botian10aHydrothermal liquefaction of municipal sludge: Coupling effects of temperature and time on nitrogen migration  aBiocrude derived from hydrothermal liquefaction of municipal sludge has a high nitrogen content, which limits its direct use.

Among the various factors that contribute towards producing a successful maize crop, seed depth placement is a key determinant. Although most no-till planters on the market work well under good soil and residue conditions, adjustments and even modifications are frequently needed when working with compacted or wet soils or with heavy residues. The main objective of this study, carried out in 2010, 2011 and 2012, was to evaluate the vertical distribution and spatial variability of seed depth placement in a maize crop under no-till conditions, using precision farming technologies and conventional no-till seeders. The results obtained indicate that the seed depth placement was affected by soil moisture content and forward speed. The seed depth placement was negatively correlated with soil resistance and seeding depth had a significant impact on mean emergence time and the percentage of emerged plants. Shallow average depth values and high coefficients of variation suggest a need for improvements in controlling the seeders’ sowing depth mechanism or more accurate calibration by operators in the field.  aPublisher supplied data 3acorn 3acorrelation 3amarkets 3ano-tillage 3aplanters 3aplanting 3aprecision agriculture 3asoil water content 3asowing 3aspatial distribution 3aPortugal1 aBarreiro, P.1 aDias, S.1 aGarrido, M.1 aValero, C.1 ada Silva, J.

The molecular orientations of the CO dipoles by electrospinning technique result in a longitudinal piezoelectric charge co-efficient (d₃₃) value of ∼(3 ± 1) pm V⁻¹ realized by piezoresponse force microscopy, allowing the PBio-e-skin for pressure sensing applications. The robust mechanical strength (Young's modulus ∼50 MPa) of nanofiber membrane ensures PBio-e-skin's superior operational stability over 375 000 cycles. Owing to the superior mechanosensitivity of ∼22 V N⁻¹, PBio-e-skin has the ability to measure subtle movement of muscle in the internal organs such as esophagus, trachea, motion of joints and arterial pressure by recognition of strains on human skin. This flexible and light weight PBio-e-skin precisely detects vital signs and provides important clinical insights without using any external power source. Eventually, the low cost, environmental friendly PBio-e-skin will have a huge impact in a broad range of applications including self-powered wearable health care systems, human–machine interfacing devices, artificial intelligence and prosthetic skin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aartificial intelligence 3aesophagus 3ahealth services 3ahumans 3amicroscopy 3amodulus of elasticity 3amonitoring 3amuscles 3ananofibers 3apolylactic acid 3aprostheses 3askin (animal) 3astrength (mechanics)1 aGhosh, Sujoy Kumar1 aSencadas, Vitor1 aZheng, Tian1 aHiggins, Michael J.1 aMiddya, Tapas Ranjan1 aMandal, Dipankar0 tJournal of materials chemistry B.g2017 Sept. 13, v. 5, no. 35 p.7352-7359dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26902x2050-75187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7tb01439b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02478naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002000166245010500186300001600291520131800307592002801625650002301653650001201676650002001688650003101708650001501739650001901754650001901773650001901792650001401811650001401825700002301839700002101862700002001883773009901903856008102002852000902083655001202092IND60080108520221120190135.0140728e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008010852DNAL7 a248175792pmid7 a10.1007/s10482-014-0187-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWhite, Colin P.10aEndospore surface properties of commonly used Bacillus anthracis surrogates vary in aqueous solution  ap. 243-251.  aThe hydrophobic character and electrophoretic mobility (EPM) of microorganisms are vital aspects of understanding their interactions with the environment. These properties are fundamental in fate-and-transport, physiological, and virulence studies, and thus integral in surrogate selection. Hydrophobic and electrostatic forces are significant contributors to particle and microorganism mobility in the environment. Herein, the surface properties of commonly used Bacillus anthracis surrogate endospores were tested under comparable conditions with respect to culture, endospore purification, buffer type and strength. Additionally, data is presented of endospores suspended in dechlorinated tap water to evaluate the surrogates in regard to a breach of water infrastructure security. The surface properties of B. anthracis were found to be the most hydrophobic and least electronegative among the six Bacillus species tested across buffer strength. The effect of EPM on hydrophobicity varies in a species-specific manner. This study demonstrates that surrogate surface properties differ and care must be taken when choosing the most suitable surrogate. Moreover, it is shown that Bacillus thuringensis best represents Bacillus anthracis-Sterne with respect to both EPM and hydrophobicity across all test buffers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus anthracis 3abuffers 3aelectrophoresis 3aelectrostatic interactions 3aendospores 3ahydrophobicity 3ainfrastructure 3amicroorganisms 3atap water 3avirulence1 aPopovici, Jonathan1 aLytle, Darren A.1 aRice, Eugene W.0 tAntonie van Leeuwenhoek.g2014 Aug., v. 106, no. 2 p.243-251dSpringer-Verlagx0003-60727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10482-014-0187-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02121naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002200146245011400168300002000282520108200302592002801384650002301412650002001435650002301455650002201478650001601500700002501516700002101541700002401562773013001586856008201716852000901798655001201807IND60565688120221120235253.0170327e20150924xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056568812DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.5b053622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWood, Mitchell
A.10aUltrafast Chemistry under Nonequilibrium Conditions and the Shock to Deflagration Transition at the Nanoscale  ap. 22008-22015.  aWe use molecular dynamics simulations to describe the chemical reactions following shock-induced collapse of cylindrical pores in the high-energy density material RDX. For shocks with particle velocities of 2 km/s we find that the collapse of a 40 nm diameter pore leads to a deflagration wave. Molecular collisions during the collapse lead to ultrafast, multistep chemical reactions that occur under nonequilibrium conditions. Exothermic products formed during these first few picoseconds prevent the nanoscale hotspot from quenching. Within 30 ps, a local deflagration wave develops; it propagates at 0.25 km/s and consists of an ultrathin reaction zone of only ∼5 nm, thus involving large temperature and composition gradients. Contrary to the assumptions in current models, a static thermal hotspot matching the dynamical one in size and thermodynamic conditions fails to produce a deflagration wave indicating the importance of nonequilibrium loading in the criticality of nanoscale hot spots. These results provide insight into the initiation of reactive decomposition.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical reactions 3aheat production 3amolecular dynamics 3asimulation models 3atemperature1 aCherukara, Mathew J.1 aKober, Edward M.1 aStrachan, Alejandro0 tThe Journal of Physical Chemistry C.g2015 Sept. 24, v. 119, no. 38 p.22008-22015dAmerican Chemical Societyx1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcc.5b053623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02864naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245011300168300001600281520124900297592002801546650002201574650002201596650002201618650002501640650001201665650001201677650001701689650001501706650001301721650001201734650002101746650000901767650002201776650004301798650002101841650001601862650001901878650002001897650001601917650002201933653002501955653001301980653001701993653002402010653001902034653004202053700001602095773011602111856008602227852000902313655001202322IND60551852720221121092448.0170124e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055185272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2014.08.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGohel, S.D.10aThermodynamics of a Ca2+-dependent highly thermostable alkaline protease from a haloalkliphilic actinomycete  ap. 421-429.  aAn alkaline protease from salt-tolerant alkaliphilic actinomycetes, Nocardiopsis alba OK-5 was purified by a single-step hydrophobic interaction chromatography and characterized. The purified protease with an estimated molecular mass of 20kDa was optimally active at 70°C in 0–3M NaCl and 0–100mM Ca2+ displaying significant stability at 50–80°C. The enzyme was stable at 80°C in 100mM Ca2+ with Kd of 17×10−3 and t1/2 of 32min. The activation energy (Ea), enthalpy (ΔH*), and entropy (ΔS*) for the protease deactivation calculated in the presence of 200mM Ca2+ were 38.15kJ/mol, 35.49kJ/mol and 183.48J/mol, respectively. The change in free energy (ΔG*) for protease deactivation at 60°C in 200mM Ca2+ was 95.88kJ/mol. Decrease in ΔH* reflected reduced cooperativity of deactivation and unfolding. The enzyme was intrinsically stable that counteracted heat denaturation by a weak cooperativity during the unfolding. Further, the enzyme was highly stable in the presence of various cations, surfactants, H2O2, β-mercaptoethanol, and commercial detergents. The compatibility of the enzyme with various cations, surfactants, and detergent matrices suggests its suitability as an additive in the detergents and peptide synthesis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGibbs free energy 3aNocardiopsis alba 3aactivation energy 3abeta-mercaptoethanol 3acalcium 3acations 3adenaturation 3adetergents 3aenthalpy 3aentropy 3aenzyme stability 3aheat 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ahydrophobic interaction chromatography 3amolecular weight 3aproteinases 3asalt tolerance 3asodium chloride 3asurfactants 3athermal stability 0aFilamentous bacteria 0aProtease 0aBiocatalysis 0aEnzyme deactivation 0aThermodynamics 0aDetergent stable thermophilic enzyme.1 aSingh, S.P.0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2015 Jan., v. 72 p.421-429dElsevier B.V.x0141-81307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2014.08.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02956naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245012300170300001600293500001500309520139600324592002801720650002101748650002101769650001601790650002301806650001701829650001501846650001101861650002501872650001901897650001901916650002101935650001301956650002401969650002101993650003602014653002502050653001502075653002402090653002002114653001802134700001402152700001302166700002002179700001302199700001602212773010202228856008702330852000902417655001202426IND60545623120221122051316.0160902e20141015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054562312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2014.07.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Sufang10aCellular target recognition of perfluoroalkyl acids: In vitro evaluation of inhibitory effects on lysine decarboxylase  ap. 381-388.  a2019-12-06  aPerfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) have been shown to bind with hepatic peroxisome proliferator receptor α, estrogen receptors and human serum albumin and subsequently cause some toxic effects. Lysine decarboxylase (LDC) plays an important role in cell growth and developmental processes. In this study, the inhibitory effect of 16 PFAAs, including 13 perfluorinated carboxylic acids (PFCAs) and 3 perfluorinated sulfonic acids (PFSAs), on lysine decarboxylase (LDC) activity was investigated. The inhibition constants obtained in fluorescence enzyme assays fall in the range of 2.960μM to 290.8μM for targeted PFCAs, and 41.22μM to 67.44μM for targeted PFSAs. The inhibitory effect of PFCAs increased significantly with carbon chain (7–18 carbons), whereas the short chain PFCAs (less than 7 carbons) did not show any effect. Circular dichroism results showed that PFAA binding induced significant protein secondary structural changes. Molecular docking revealed that the inhibitory effect could be rationalized well by the cleft binding mode as well as the size, substituent group and hydrophobic characteristics of the PFAAs. At non-cytotoxic concentrations, three selected PFAAs inhibited LDC activity in HepG2 cells, and subsequently resulted in the decreased cadaverine level in the exposed cells, suggesting that LDC may be a possible target of PFAAs for their in vivo toxic effects.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahuman cell lines 3amolecular models 3acell growth 3aestrogen receptors 3afluorescence 3acadaverine 3acarbon 3alysine decarboxylase 3ahydrophobicity 3asulfonic acids 3ain vitro studies 3atoxicity 3ahuman serum albumin 3acarboxylic acids 3acircular dichroism spectroscopy 0aLysine decarboxylase 0aInhibition 0aPerfluoroalkyl acid 0aCellular target 0asulfonic acid1 aLv, Qiyan1 aYang, Yu1 aGuo, Liang-Hong1 aWan, Bin1 aZhao, Lixia0 tScience of the total environment.g2014 Oct. 15, v. 496 p.381-388dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2014.07.0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02850naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002200145245015000167300001400317520145500331592002801786650002501814650001601839650001801855650001201873650001601885650002501901650001501926650001601941650002201957650001001979650001501989650001502004651001002019653002702029653002302056653002202079653001702101700002202118700001702140700002202157773012202179852000902301856008202310655001202392IND4387491820221119033919.0200513e20070201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438749182DNAL7 a10.1007/s10310-006-0243-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaleque, M.

Don) plantations  ap. 14-23.  aWe investigated the effects of line thinning on the abundance of Hymenoptera in two Japanese cedar plantations in northern Hyogo Prefecture, central Japan, in order to evaluate the effectiveness of this silvicultural treatment for ecosystem management. Line thinning is a silvicultural treatment practiced in Japan, where linear stand sections are cut (25%–35% of the total number of trees) retaining one to two rows of trees. We used Malaise traps to capture Hymenoptera from the line-thinned stand (treatment plot, including thinned and retained sections) and the unthinned stand (control plot). Overall, the total number of Hymenoptera was greater in the treatment plot than in the control plot. The treatment plot hosted more functional groups and families of Hymenoptera than the control plot in both plantations. In the Kuchiotani plantation (high-elevation site), the overall abundance of Hymenoptera and of many Hymenopteran functional groups were positively correlated with both species richness and biomass of understory plants. In the Sugi plantation (low-elevation site), understory vegetation was less developed and there was no correlation with abundance of Hymenoptera. Our study indicates that line thinning is an effective silvicultural treatment for future management of overstocked Japanese cedar plantations because it can fulfill biodiversity objectives, but the effectiveness may depend on silvicultural and landscape factors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCryptomeria japonica 3aHymenoptera 3aMalaise traps 3abiomass 3acorrelation 3aecosystem management 3alandscapes 3aplantations 3aspecies diversity 3atrees 3aunderstory 3avegetation 3aJapan 0aArthropod biodiversity 0aEcosystem function 0aForest management 0aMalaise trap1 aIshii, Hiroaki T.1 aMaeto, Kaoru1 aTaniguchi, Shingo0 tJournal of forest research.g2007 Feb. 1, v. 12, no. 1 p.14-23dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl3870061x1610-74037nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10310-006-0243-63Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02126naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002300155245011200178300001400290520087500304592002801179650001201207650001001219650002001229650001101249650001801260650002201278650000901300650001601309650001701325650000901342650001201351653002301363653001001386653000901396653001501405653002301420700001801443700002501461773010701486856009001593852000901683655001201692IND60526403320221118134517.0190405e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052640332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.smallrumres.2016.02.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCastillo, Cristina10aUsefulness of metabolic profiling in the assessment of the flock's health status and productive performance  ap. 28-30.  aProduction diseases are established when there is an intense imbalance between what is offered to the animal (as food) and what is required (in the form of milk/meat/offspring). In such situations, the solution involves not only the assessment of animal ration or the health program, but also, their health status. This information can only be accessed by performing blood tests, measuring a series of specific metabolites and enzymatic activities, and interpreting them in the scenario in which the animals are, which is known as clinical biochemistry. The aim of this paper is to address the information we get through the measurement of the different profiles, with special emphasis on the metabolic ones; when to do it, and when not to, what precautions should be taken so that blood collected by venipuncture can be reliable for further analysis and interpretation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimals 3ablood 3aenzyme activity 3aflocks 3ahealth status 3ahematologic tests 3ameat 3ametabolites 3ametabolomics 3amilk 3aprogeny 0aMetabolic profiles 0aSheep 0aGoat 0aLaboratory 0aClinical pathology1 aAbuelo, Angel1 aHernandez, Joaquín,0 tSmall ruminant research.g2016 Sept., v. 142 p.28-30dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl44843x0921-44887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.smallrumres.2016.02.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03334naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245012300159300001600282520180900298592002802107650001302135650002002148650001702168650001202185650000902197650001202206650001202218650001002230650001102240650002602251650001402277650002202291650002002313650002102333650001702354651001902371700002302390700001902413700001902432700002302451700003102474700002102505700002002526700001802546773018202564856007302746852000902819655001202828IND60125931420221117234700.0150428e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012593142DNAL7 a10.1111/bij.124502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSacchi, Roberto10aContext‐dependent expression of sexual dimorphism in island populations of the common wall lizard (Podarcis muralis)  ap. 552-565.  aThe condition‐dependent sexual dimorphism model explains the evolution and maintenance of sexual dimorphism in traits targeted by sexual selection, and predicts that the magnitude of sexual dimorphism depends on the variability of individual condition, male traits being more variable than female corresponding traits. Most convincing examples concern insects, while studies among vertebrates are scanty because manipulating condition often is not possible, and the time to reach sexual maturity may be too long. Islands offer a unique opportunity to compare how the environment affects the expression of sexual dimorphism, since they represent ‘natural experimental sets’ in which different populations of the same species may experience alternative environmental constraints. We investigated the occurrence of context‐dependent expression in sexual dimorphism of head shape in insular populations of the common wall lizards (Podarcis muralis) inhabiting the Tuscan Archipelago (Tyrrhenian Sea). Alternative models were formulated: H₀assumes that the sexual dimorphism is uninfluenced by islands, H₁assumes the only effect of phylogeny, H₂Aand H₂Baccount for the biogeography of the archipelago (island size and distance from the mainland), while H₃assumes island‐specific effects on sexual dimorphism. Models were compared using Akaike's information criterion adjusted for multivariate analyses. All hypotheses performed better than H₀, but H₃largely outperformed all other alternative hypotheses, indicating that environmental features of islands play an additive effect to ontogenetic, biogeographic and genetic factors in defining variation in head shape sexual dimorphism. Our results support the hypothesis of a context‐dependent sexual dimorphism in common wall lizards.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPodarcis 3aadditive effect 3abiogeography 3afemales 3ahead 3ainsects 3aislands 3amales 3amodels 3amultivariate analysis 3aphylogeny 3asexual dimorphism 3asexual maturity 3asexual selection 3awall lizards 3aTyrrhenian Sea1 aMangiacotti, Marco1 aScali, Stefano1 aSannolo, Marco1 aZuffi, Marco A.

The severity of Yellow Sigatoka, soil fertility and plant nutritional status were evaluated at each point. The spherical model was adjusted for all variables using restricted maximum likelihood. Kriging maps showed the highest infection rate of Sigatoka occurred in high areas of the field which had the highest concentration of sand, while the lowest disease was found in lower areas with lower silt, organic matter, total exchangeable bases, effective cation exchange capacity, base saturation, Ca and Mg in soil, and foliar sulfur (S). These results may help farmers manage Yellow Sigatoka disease more effectively, with balanced fertilization and reduced fungicide application. This practice minimizes the environmental impact and cost of production while contributing to production sustainability.  aPublisher supplied data 3abase saturation 3acalcium 3acation exchange capacity 3aenvironmental impact 3afarmers 3afungicides 3ageoreferencing 3ageostatistics 3akriging 3aleaf spot 3amagnesium 3amodels 3anutritional status 3aorganic matter 3apesticide application 3aplant nutrition 3aproduction costs 3asand 3asilt 3asoil fertility 3asulfur 3ayellow Sigatoka1 aPozza, E.

It is concluded that forensic science’s best assurance to address current and future challenges, particularly in an increasingly digital environment, remains a sound scientific approach, including critical thinking and inter-disciplinary collaborations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aforensic sciences 3apandemic 3asociety 0aTrace 0aBacklog 0aError rate 0aRisk 0aScientific approach 0aInter-disciplinary collaborations1 aWeyermann, Céline1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3533-39190 tForensic science international.g2020 Nov., v. 316 p.110503-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:3523x0379-07387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.forsciint.2020.1105033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01044naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002700140245005500167300001800222520020500240592002800445650001300473650001800486650001900504700002000523700001900543773012100562856007400683852000900757655001200766IND60664143220221121014418.0190910e20121001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066414322DNAL7 a10.1039/c2ra21334f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRasale, Dnyaneshwar B.10aEmerging π-stacked dynamic nanostructured library  ap. 9791-9794.  aWe describe a general strategy to control the state of molecular self-assembly under thermodynamic control in which gelation facilitates formation of a predominating π-stacked nanostructured product.  aPublisher supplied data 3agelation 3ananomaterials 3athermodynamics1 aMaity, Indrajit1 aDas, Apurba K.0 tRSC advances.g2012 Oct. 1, v. 2, no. 26 p.9791-9794dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c2ra21334f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02878naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001800188245016200206300001200368506007600380520160900456592002802065506003702093650001702130650001602147650001202163650001502175650001502190651001202205700002302217700001802240700002402258700002302282773009702305856008102402852000902483655001202492IND60550189320221207113940.0170725e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055018932DNAL7 a10.1186/s12917-016-0822-52doi7 aPMC50120452pmcid7 a276010502pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchulz, Katja10aHunters’ acceptability of the surveillance system and alternative surveillance strategies for classical swine fever in wild boar - a participatory approach  ap. 187.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Surveillance measures can only be effective if key players in the system accept them. Acceptability, which describes the willingness of persons to contribute, is often analyzed using participatory methods. Participatory epidemiology enables the active involvement of key players in the assessment of epidemiological issues. In the present study, we used a participatory method recently developed by CIRAD (Centre de Coopération Internationale en Recherche Agronomique pour le Développement) to evaluate the functionality and acceptability of Classical Swine Fever (CSF) surveillance in wild boar in Germany, which is highly dependent on the participation of hunters. The acceptability of alternative surveillance strategies was also analyzed. By conducting focus group discussions, potential vulnerabilities in the system were detected and feasible alternative surveillance strategies identified. RESULTS: Trust in the current surveillance system is high, whereas the acceptability of the operation of the system is medium. Analysis of the acceptability of alternative surveillance strategies showed how risk-based surveillance approaches can be combined to develop strategies that have sufficient support and functionality. Furthermore, some surveillance strategies were clearly rejected by the hunters. Thus, the implementation of such strategies may be difficult. CONCLUSIONS: Participatory methods can be used to evaluate the functionality and acceptability of existing surveillance plans for CSF among hunters and to optimize plans regarding their chances of successful implementation.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aepidemiology 3ahog cholera 3ahunters 3amonitoring 3awild boars 3aGermany1 aCalba, Clémentine1 aPeyre, Marisa1 aStaubach, Christoph1 aConraths, Franz J.0 tBMC veterinary research.g2016 Dec., v. 12, no. 1 p.187-187dBioMed Centralx1746-61487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12917-016-0822-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02255naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002400166245008900190300001600279520126300295592002801558650002901586650001301615650002101628650001701649650001201666650001701678650001201695650001101707700002301718773008601741856008101827852000901908655001201917IND60081783120221121051115.0141014e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008178312DNAL7 a249649662pmid7 a10.1007/s00412-014-0472-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMalvezzi, Francesca10a“Uno, nessuno e centomila”: the different faces of the budding yeast kinetochore  ap. 447-457.  a“One, no one and one hundred thousand” is a masterpiece of Italian literature, written by Luigi Pirandello. The central theme is that in each individual there are multiple personalities, since one’s perception of one’s self differs from the view of others. As a consequence, a unique identity does not exist, but rather one hundred thousand. This concept can be very well applied to the kinetochore, one of the largest macromolecular complexes conserved in eukaryotes. The kinetochore is essential during cell division and fulfills different sophisticated functions, including linking chromosomes to spindle microtubules and delaying anaphase onset in case of incorrect bi-orientation. In order to perform these tasks, the kinetochore shapes its structure by recruiting different subunits, such as the components of the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) or the monopolin complex during meiosis. It also modifies its internal organization by rearranging intramolecular connections and acquiring a distinct identity at different time points of cell division. In this review, we describe recent insights into the changes in composition and configuration of the kinetochore in mitosis and meiosis, focusing on the kinetochore of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aanaphase 3aeukaryotic cells 3akinetochores 3ameiosis 3amicrotubules 3amitosis 3ayeasts1 aWestermann, Stefan0 tChromosoma.g2014 Oct., v. 123, no. 5 p.447-457dSpringer-Verlagx0009-59157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00412-014-0472-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03167naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245013900165300001600304520138400320592002801704650001701732650001701749650001801766650001201784650001901796650001201815650001101827650001101838650001501849650002201864650001701886650001201903650001401915650001801929650001001947650002001957650001401977650002101991650001402012650001002026650002202036650000902058651001202067651001602079653001802095653001802113653001802131653002702149653001702176700002402193700001802217700002002235700001802255700002002273700002102293773012402314852000902438856008202447655001202529IND4389661320221119033757.0200513e20070401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438966132DNAL7 a10.1007/s10310-006-0258-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aŌhashi, Mizue,14aThe effect of red wood ant (Formica rufa group) mounds on root biomass, density, and nutrient concentrations in boreal managed forests  ap. 113-119.  aRed wood ants (Formica rufa group, RWAs) are common insects in boreal forests in Fennoscandia, and they build large, long-lived mounds as their nests. RWA mounds are enriched with carbon and nutrients, but little information is available about how they affect root distribution and the nutrient uptake of trees. In this study, we investigated the biomass, biomass density, nutrient concentrations, and amounts of fine (<2 mm) and coarse (>2 mm) roots in RWA mounds, and compared them with those of surrounding forest soil in mixed coniferous stands of different age classes in Finland. Neither fine nor coarse root biomasses differed significantly between the aboveground parts of the mounds and the organic layer of the soil. Root biomass density was lower in mounds than in the organic layer. However, fine root biomass and biomass density were higher in the belowground parts of mounds than in the surrounding mineral soil. Macroelement (N, Ca, K, P, S, Mg) and Zn and Cu concentrations in roots in the mounds were significantly higher than those in the organic layer. Root biomass and biomass density did not differ between stands of different age classes. The results of this study indicate that RWA mounds increase heterogeneity in root distribution in forest ecosystems, and also increase the availability of nutrients for plants that extend their roots inside RWA mounds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFormica rufa 3aaerial parts 3aage structure 3abiomass 3aboreal forests 3acalcium 3acarbon 3acopper 3afine roots 3aforest ecosystems 3aforest soils 3ainsects 3amagnesium 3amineral soils 3anests 3anutrient uptake 3anutrients 3aorganic horizons 3apotassium 3atrees 3aunderground parts 3azinc 3aFinland 3aScandinavia 0aClear-cutting 0aBoreal forest 0aNorway spruce 0aNutrient concentration 0aRoot biomass1 aKilpeläinen, Jouni1 aFinér, Leena1 aRisch, Anita C.1 aDomisch, Timo1 aNeuvonen, Seppo1 aNiemelä, Pekka,0 tJournal of forest research.g2007 Apr. 1, v. 12, no. 2 p.113-119dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl3870061x1610-74037nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10310-006-0258-z3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02090naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245013500155300002000290520084100310592002801151650000801179650002401187650001101211650001901222650002201241650001801263650001301281650001801294650001301312650002201325650001401347700001701361700001701378700001701395700001801412700001401430700001801444773012301462856007401585852000901659655001201668IND60664143420221121014209.0190910e20121008xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066414342DNAL7 a10.1039/c2ra21338a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Yong10aElectrospun carbon nanofibrous mats surface-decorated with Pd nanoparticles via the supercritical CO₂ method for sensing of H₂  ap. 10195-10199.  aCarbon nanofibers (in the form of an overlaid mat) were prepared by electrospinning of polyacrylonitrile followed by stabilization in air and carbonization in argon. Pd nanoparticles were then deposited on the surface of nanofibers by using Pd(acac)₂ as the precursor via the supercritical CO₂ method followed by pyrolysis at 600 °C. Structural characterizations indicated that the Pd nanoparticles were composed of single-crystalline clusters with sizes of a few nanometers. The hydrogen sensing properties of electrospun carbon nanofibrous mats surface decorated with Pd nanoparticles were investigated. The results indicated that the resistivity of Pd-decorated nanofibrous mats decreased linearly with the increase of H₂ volume fraction from 0 to 0.7 in H₂/N₂ mixture gas, and the response showed excellent reversibility.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aargon (noble gases) 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon nanofibers 3acarbonization 3ahydrogen 3ananoparticles 3anitrogen 3apolyacrylonitrile 3apyrolysis1 aWang, Xiaoxu1 aLai, Chuilin1 aHe, Guangfei1 aZhang, Lifeng1 aFong, Hao1 aZhu, Zhengtao0 tRSC advances.g2012 Oct. 8, v. 2, no. 27 p.10195-10199dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c2ra21338a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03930naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245016000170300001600330520231700346592002802663650001702691650001302708650001402721650001102735650001102746650000902757650001302766650001302779650001202792650001702804650001702821650001502838650001602853650001002869650000802879650001602887650001302903650001002916650001502926650001302941650001202954650001502966650000902981650002202990650002303012650001403035650001903049650001703068650001303085650001503098651001103113700001803124773009303142856008403235852000903319655001203328IND60085970520221120123927.0141101e20120628xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008597052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.quaint.2012.03.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRusakov, Alexey10aLate Quaternary pedogenesis in periglacial zone of northeastern Europe near ice margins since MIS 3: Timing, processes, and linkages to landscape evolution  ap. 126-141.  aTwo paleosol-sedimentary sequences Koskovo and Puzbol developed within the nearest periglacial zone of Valday glaciation of the East European Plain (56.7°–58.5° N, the Upper Volga River basin) were studied to reconstruct soil mantle and landscape evolution since Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 3. The sequences are formed on terraces at 130–141 and 172m a.s.l., constituted by ancient (Early Valday (Würm) or Late Moscow (RissII)) lake clayey sediments. The buried paleosols are represented by system of horizons Hb–G3b (Histosol), Agb–G3b and AGb horizon (Umbric Gleysol). The ¹⁴C age of the paleosol humus and peat varied between 50,300–39,700 cal. BP. These paleosols were developed under forest-tundra and pine-spruce forests with the meadow plant communities and the areas of swampy vegetation according to palynological data from Puzbol. They represent the northernmost occurrence of the MIS3 fossil soil in Europe dominated by the features of gleyzation, cryogenic aggregation, cracking, and humus and peat formation. Clay coatings in the Middle Valday paleosols and pedosediments are products of Holocene pedogenesis. The upper lithological layers covering the MIS3 paleosols are loess-like (mantle) loams underlain by clayey Late Pleistocene lake deposits. They mark the presence of wide extraglacial lakes with existed within the Upper Volga basin during the maximum advance of the Valday glaciation (MIS2). Based on the stratigraphy of the studied sections, the highstands of these Late Quaternary lakes might exceed ≈170m a.s.l. For the first time it was possible to date the age of humus-clay coatings developed in the Bthk3 horizon (c.1.6–2.0m) of Puzbol where in the upper part of the section the Cutanic Albeluvisol formed. The Early Middle Holocene age of humic acid of humus-clay coatings (≈10,900 cal. BP) and carbonate nodules 7500–8180 cal. BP refer to the first stage of pedogenesis of this polygenetic soil, which occurred from pre-Boreal to the Atlantic period, and was characterized by dark humus accumulation and carbonate precipitation in a poorly drained landscape. The ¹⁴C age of the fulvic acids of these coatings (≈6130 cal. BP) is indicative of the beginning of the second stage, dominated by clay illuviation under a better drained, leaching environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlbeluvisols 3aGleysols 3aHistosols 3abasins 3acarbon 3aclay 3acoatings 3acracking 3aforests 3afossil soils 3afulvic acids 3aglaciation 3ahumic acids 3ahumus 3aice 3ailluviation 3aisotopes 3alakes 3alandscapes 3aleaching 3ameadows 3apalynology 3apeat 3aplant communities 3aradiocarbon dating 3asediments 3asoil formation 3astratigraphy 3aterraces 3awatersheds 3aEurope1 aSedov, Sergey0 tQuaternary international.g2012 June 28, v. 265 p.126-141dElsevier Ltdx1040-61827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2012.03.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02735naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245017300174300001800347500001900365520137500384592002801759650001701787650001301804650002301817650002001840650001201860650002401872650000701896650002001903650002101923653001501944653001701959653001601976700002001992700002002012700002102032700002702053773013702080856008702217852000902304655001202313IND60713289420221122182747.0201209e20201215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071328942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2020.10.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSrivastava, Binti10aImmobilization of keratinase on chitosan grafted-β-cyclodextrin for the improvement of the enzyme properties and application of free keratinase in the textile industry  ap. 1099-1110.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aImmobilization of enzymes is an effective and potential technique for improving the enzyme characteristics and plays an important role in reducing the final cost of enzymatic reactions. However, the method of enzyme immobilization should be easy, cost-effective and environment friendly when applicable at industrial scale. In present study, the successful biochemical characterization of free and immobilized keratinase was evaluated. The enzyme was effectively immobilized on chitosan and chitosan grafted-β-cyclodextrin beads. Enzyme yield of immobilized biocatalyst on chitosan alone and chitosan-β-CD-E was determined to be 90 and 93% respectively. Keratinase was able to act in highly alkaline conditions (optimum pH 11) both in free and immobilized form and showed maximum enzyme activity at 70 and 75 °C respectively. The free and immobilized enzyme exhibited remarkable thermo stability at 70 °C implying that it is capable for its usage in textile industry. The storage stability and reusability of the immobilized keratinase (chitosan-E and chitosan-β-CD-E) was significantly enhanced, with 25 and 53.5% activity, respectively, retained at 4 °C after 30 days of storage. In the preliminary experiments it was found that free keratinase have the potential to improve the quality of woollen fabrics and suitable for application in textile industries.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiocatalysts 3achitosan 3acost effectiveness 3aenzyme activity 3afabrics 3aimmobilized enzymes 3apH 3astorage quality 3atextile industry 0aKeratinase 0aCyclodextrin 0aWool fabric1 aHarpreet Singh,1 aKhatrī, Madhu,1 aSingh, Gursharan1 aArya, Shailendra Kumar0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2020 Dec. 15, v. 165 p.1099-1110dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2020.10.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03373naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245012700165300001300292520195500305592002802260650002302288650001202311650002702323650000902350650001002359650001902369650001102388650001502399650001902414650002102433650002602454650001402480650001902494650001502513650001802528650001402546650002402560650001202584650001502596651001602611700001702627700001702644700001802661773011002679856008102789852000902870655001202879IND60081320920221118232735.0150108e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008132092DNAL7 a10.1007/s10333-014-0444-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, Jeong-Ho10aEcosystem health evaluation of agricultural reservoirs using multi-metric lentic ecosystem health assessment (LEHA) model  ap. 7-18.  aThe objectives of this study were to determine the trophic state of agricultural reservoirs within the four major watersheds and evaluate ecosystem health using a multi-metric fish modeling approach of the lentic ecosystem health assessment (LEHA) in South Korea. Fish survey for the LEHA model was sampled twice from 12 reservoirs (oligotrophic to hypereutrophic reservoirs) during 2008–2010 along with data analysis of water quality monitored by the Ministry of Environment, Korea. The fish sampling gears used in the field were fyke net, trammel net, casting net, and kick net. A regression analysis of N:P ratios showed a negative linear function with total phosphorous (TP) values but not with total nitrogen. The greater relationship to TP was due to low variability and high ambient concentrations of N relative to P. The plots of “TSI (CHL)–TSI (TP)” and “TSI (CHL)–TSI (SD)” suggest that other factors other than phosphorus limited algal biomass (CHL–TP < 0), and that non-algal particles dominated light attenuation (CHL–SD < 0). Nutrients input into the reservoirs during the Asian monsoon exceeded actual nutrient availability for phytoplankton growth. A regression model of the fish trophic components against log-transformed TP showed that the proportions of omnivore and insectivore fish had a positive linear function and negative relationship with TP, respectively. According to the multi-metric LEHA model for agricultural reservoirs, the model value averaged 26 ± 6.5, indicating a “Fair” condition. Overall, ecosystem health was directly influenced by organic matter pollution and high algal production. This new tool appeared particularly relevant to detect the contamination effects on fish communities in reservoirs. The new national biological monitoring methodology in lentic ecosystem would be used as a key tool for ecological restorations and species conservations in Korean lentic ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal communities 3abiomass 3aecological restoration 3afish 3agears 3alentic systems 3amodels 3amonitoring 3amonsoon season 3anitrogen content 3anutrient availability 3anutrients 3aorganic matter 3aphosphorus 3aphytoplankton 3apollution 3aregression analysis 3asurveys 3awatersheds 3aSouth Korea1 aKim, Bomchul1 aKim, Chulgoo1 aAn, Kwang-Guk0 tPaddy and water environment.g2014 Aug., v. 12, no.

The Italian longitudinal study on aging  ap. 220-226.  aBACKGROUND AND AIMS: Three groups of subjects were identified within a representative sample of older Italians: subjects with normal fasting glucose (NFG), with impaired fasting glucose (IFG) or with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D). The aim of the present study was to evaluate the relationship among plasma lipids, lipoproteins, other metabolic factors in the three groups, and their role in predicting total fatal events. METHODS AND RESULTS: 2422 subjects, aged 65–84 years, taking part into the Italian Longitudinal Study on Aging were included in the analyses. Factor analysis was conducted separately for men and women. Factor scores were used as independent variables in Cox Proportional Hazard models, to determine factors predicting death at the follow-up in NFG, IFG and T2D subjects. Four major factors were found for men (“insulin resistance”, “body size”, “total cholesterol”, “HDL cholesterol”) and four also for women (“insulin resistance”, “total cholesterol”, “body size”, “HDL cholesterol”). For NFG and IFG men, and for both T2D men and women, the “HDL cholesterol” was a significant protective factor for total deaths (NFG men: HR = 0.79, 95% CI 0.67–0.93; IFG men: HR = 0.59, 95% CI 0.45–0.79; T2D men: HR = 0.55, 95% CI 0.34–0.89; T2D women: HR = 0.61, 95% CI 0.44–0.86). Among NFG women, the “body size” factor was also a protective factor with respect to total deaths (HR = 0.74, 95% CI 0.57–0.95). CONCLUSION: A factor including HDL Cholesterol and Apo A-I showed protection against all-cause mortality in older men, independently from the glycemia level, and in women only in those diagnosed with T2D.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood glucose 3ablood lipids 3abody size 3adeath 3aelderly 3afasting 3aglucose 3ahigh density lipoprotein cholesterol 3ainsulin resistance 3alongitudinal studies 3amen 3amodels 3amortality 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3aprediction 3arisk factors 3awomen 2aAged 2aAged, 80 and over 2aAging 2aAnthropometry 2aApolipoprotein A-Ixblood 2aBlood Glucosexanalysisxmetabolism. 2aCholesterol, HDLxblood 2aCholesterol, LDL 2aDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2xbloodxdiagnosisxphysiopathology. 2aFactor Analysis, Statistical 2aFasting 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aInsulin Resistance 2aLongitudinal Studies 2aMale 2aPrediabetic Statexbloodxdiagnosisxphysiopathology. 2aRisk Factors 0aItaly1 aMaggi, S.1 aZanoni, S.1 aLimongi, F.1 aZambon, S.1 aCrepaldi, G.0 tNutrition, metabolism, and cardiovascular diseases.g2013 Mar., v. 23, no. 3 p.220-226dElsevier B.V.x0939-47537nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.numecd.2011.06.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02567naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245012400164300001600288520153700304592002801841650002501869650002301894650000901917650001601926650001801942650001301960650001101973650001301984650001101997700001802008773011302026856008102139852000902220655001202229IND60081321020221118233205.0150108e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008132102DNAL7 a10.1007/s10333-014-0445-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHong, Mun Gi10aRole and effects of winter buds and rhizome morphology on the survival and growth of common reed (Phragmites australis)  ap. 203-209.  aTo confirm the role of winter buds and rhizome morphology on the winter survival and subsequent growth of common reed (Phragmites australis), rhizome fragments of varying sizes with and without winter buds from three different P. australis populations were transplanted to small pots in a greenhouse and wintered by exposing them to a dry atmospheric condition. Survival ratios of the rhizome fragments with winter buds were much greater than those without winter buds regardless of population type, supporting that winter buds play a role as the insulator of rhizome fragments from dry atmosphere during winter season. Most growth characteristics of surviving P. australis from the rhizome fragments were similar to those in natural wetlands, indicating preserved growth characteristics through the rhizomes, which is an asexual organ. The average number of rhizome fragment nodes showed negative relationships with the number of blades per culm (P < .05) and basal culm diameter (P < .05) of surviving P. australis. In contrast, the diameter of planted rhizome fragments had significant positive relationships with the final shoot height (P < .05), above-ground dry weight (P < .05), root DW (P < .01), and total DW (P < .05). Rhizome volume also showed a similar correlation with the rhizome diameter. Thicker and larger rhizome fragments particularly with winter buds, indicating the young age of rhizome, seemed likely to guarantee greater survival and higher subsequent shoot growth and biomass production as well.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhragmites australis 3abiomass production 3abuds 3agreenhouses 3aoverwintering 3arhizomes 3ashoots 3awetlands 3awinter1 aKim, Jae Geun0 tPaddy and water environment.g2014 Aug., v. 12, no.

The 16S rRNA gene sequence of strain KBL006ᵀ showed 96.4 % similarity to that of Wohlfahrtiimonas chitiniclastica S5ᵀ. Strain KBL006ᵀ grew optimally at 30 °C, at pH 8.0 and in the presence of 1–2 % (w/v) NaCl. Oxidase activity and catalase activity were positive. The major fatty acids were C₁₈:₁ ω7c, C₁₄:₀, and C₁₆:₀. The major respiratory quinone was ubiquinone-8 (Q-8). The major polar lipids were phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, and diphosphatidylglycerol, and two phospholipids. The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 45.2 mol%. Based on these polyphasic data, strain KBL006ᵀ is considered to represent a novel species in the genus Wohlfahrtiimonas, for which the name Wohlfahrtiimonas larvae sp. nov. is proposed.

The impact of geographic location on the volatile compounds and microbial communities in wheat Qu remains unknown. This study demonstrated significant differences in the volatile compound profiles of wheat Qu from different regions of China. Phenylethyl alcohol, hexadecanoic acid methyl ester, 9-octadecenoic acid methyl ester, and 2-octanone were the main volatile compounds detected. The bacterial and fungal communities in wheat Qu also differed significantly according to geographic location with both communities explaining the variation in volatile compounds (bacteria making the greater contribution). The bacterial community was dominated by Pediococcus, Weissella, and Lactobacillus while the fungal community was dominated by Saccharomycopsis and Rhizopus. Bacteria exhibited more significant associations with volatile compounds than fungi did. Prediction of metabolic function demonstrated significantly different profiles for the bacterial communities from different regions. These data showed that geographic location considerably affects the composition of volatile compounds and microbial communities in wheat Qu, with the bacterial community being the main contributor to variation of volatile compounds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLactobacillus 3aPediococcus 3aRhizopus 3aSaccharomycopsis 3aWeissella 3abacterial communities 3abiochemical pathways 3afermentation 3afungal communities 3afungi 3aoleic acid 3apalmitic acid 3aphenylethyl alcohol 3aprediction 3arice wines 3avolatile compounds 3awheat 3aChina 0aWheat Qu 0aRice wine 0aVolatile compounds 0aMicrobial community 0aGeographic variability1 aWang, Lian1 aZhang, Ying-Gang1 aTu, Ting-Yao1 aWang, Song-Tao1 aShen, Cai-Hong1 aYuan, Hua-Wei1 aZhong, Xiao-Zhong0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2021 Aug., v. 148 p.111752-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2021.1117523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02833naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245015300168300001600321520172400337592002802061650002102089650001602110650001302126650002602139650001202165650001202177651001102189651001002200651001302210700002202223700002302245700001702268773009302285856008402378852000902462655001202471IND60085970920221120123935.0141101e20120628xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008597092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.quaint.2011.07.0362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVacca, Andrea10aFerruginous paleosols around the Cretaceous-Paleocene boundary in central-southern Sardinia (Italy) and their potential as pedostratigraphic markers  ap. 179-190.  aThe properties of seven ferruginous paleosols, formed in alluvial continental deposits of Upper Cretaceous-Paleocene age in central-southern Sardinia (Italy), were examined to understand their genesis. Particular attention has been addressed to their paleoenvironmental and paleogeographic significance, also in comparison with similar paleosols in southern France, and to their potential to represent good pedostratigraphic markers for a larger area. The paleosols are characterized by petroplinthic, pisoplinthic, plinthic or pisolithic horizons. Their genesis started under a warm and humid tropical climate, with distinct wet and dry seasons, of the Latest Maastrichtian-Lower Paleocene and continued, under increasingly dry conditions, during the Middle to Upper Paleocene. The major differences that occur among the paleosols can be related to differences in geomorphic position, parent material characteristics and drainage conditions. The pisolithic paleosols of central-southern Sardinia show a structure and composition comparable to those of the coeval ones in southern France, which were formed under similar climatic conditions. On the basis of the constant stratigraphic position, the large geographic extent and the supposed former lateral continuity, the studied ferruginous paleosols can be considered to be a good pedostratigraphic marker in central-southern Sardinia and in southern France and are informally named as the “Monte Maraconis geosol”. This allows extensive chronostratigraphic correlations as well as regional-scale morphostratigraphic correlations and represents, with its typical pedofacies, a pedostratigraphic unit worthy of consideration in future regional geological mapping.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimatic factors 3acorrelation 3adrainage 3apaleosolic soil types 3aseasons 3atropics 3aFrance 3aItaly 3aSardinia1 aFerrara, Concetta1 aMatteucci, Ruggero1 aMurru, Marco0 tQuaternary international.g2012 June 28, v. 265 p.179-190dElsevier Ltdx1040-61827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2011.07.0363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02328naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001400152245014500166520115800311592002801469650001101497650002301508650001201531650001101543650001101554650002901565653002501594653002901619653002901648653002901677653002301706700002401729700001901753773009801772856008701870852000901957655001201966IND60782783620221119171638.0220824e20221001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078278362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2022.1196302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJani, Ali10aTwo-layer stochastic day-ahead and real-time energy management of networked microgrids considering integration of renewable energy resources  aIn this paper, we propose a multi-time scale energy management for the networked microgrids that considers both day-ahead and real-time scheduling. The proposed multi-time scale energy management system consists of two stages. In the first stage, a stochastic two-layer framework is implemented to minimize the operating costs of the networked microgrid in the day-ahead market. In the second stage, the first operation planning is updated in real-time every 15 min to reduce fluctuations in renewable energy sources. The objective function of the second stage is to minimize the cost of imbalance and optimally regulate the local generation of microgrids. Also, demand response programs have been used to reduce peak demand and the operating cost of MGs. Two case studies have been investigated to evaluate the impact of the proposed method. However, the effect of arbitrage in single and double price markets has been evaluated. The proposed model has been formulated as mixed-integer linear programming and the obtained results show that the proposed model reduces the operating cost by $86.27 and provides better planning by internal power trading.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy 3amanagement systems 3amarkets 3amodels 3aprices 3arenewable energy sources 0aNetworked microgrids 0aHybrid energy management 0aDemand response programs 0aRenewable energy sources 0aReal-time dispatch1 aKarīmī, Ḥamīd,1 aJadid, Shahram0 tApplied energy.g2022 Oct. 01, v. 323 p.119630-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2022.1196303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02536naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001900137245018500156300001800341520144000359592002801799650002601827650001301853650001501866650001301881650001301894650001201907651001401919700002101933700002401954700001901978773012101997856007102118852000902189655001202198IND60745705920221120142620.0210723s2021    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074570592DNAL7 a10.1071/MF202872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDay, Jeremy K.10aDietary analysis and mesocosm feeding trials confirm the eastern rock lobster (Sagmariasus verreauxi) as a generalist predator that can avoid ingesting urchin spines during feeding  ap. 1220-1232.  aWorldwide, lobsters are considered important predators of macroalgae-consuming urchin species, but this has not been tested for Australia’s common lobster, the eastern rock lobster (Sagmariasus verreauxi). We predicted that the abundant urchins, the long-spined urchin (Centrostephanus rodgersii) and the short-spined urchin (Heliocidaris erythrogramma), would form substantial components of lobster diets. To test this hypothesis, we examined 115 lobster stomachs from 9 locations and conducted 14 feeding trials, in which lobsters were offered either urchin species. Dissections revealed various stomach items, with detritus (51%), bivalves (34%), gastropods (28%) and algae (26%) occurring more frequently than urchins (19%). Urchin spines were found in 22 lobsters that ranged in size from 91- to 124-mm carapace length, with all individuals containing H. erythrogramma spines and C. rodgersii spines observed only once. During feeding trials, seven urchins were consumed. Four H. erythrogramma were eaten on Day 1, whereas one was not eaten until Day 11. Two C. rodgersii were eaten on Days 2 and 10. Only three of the six lobsters observed to eat urchins ingested spines. Together, these data show that S. verreauxi is a generalist predator that consumes urchins, although, because urchins could be eaten without ingesting spines, future studies are needed to assess the importance of urchins as dietary items for S. verreauxi.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSagmariasus verreauxi 3adetritus 3afreshwater 3alobsters 3aresearch 3astomach 3aAustralia1 aKnott, Nathan A.1 aSwadling, Daniel S.1 aAyre, David J.0 tMarine & freshwater research.g2021, v. 72, no. 8 p.1220-1232dCSIRO PublishingwJournal:jnl3957320x1323-16507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/MF202873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03269naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001400171245010800185300001400293520170400307592002802011650001202039650001802051650002202069650002202091650001102113650002502124650002502149650001602174650004302190650001802233650002502251650002102276650001102297650002802308651001602336651001602352651001002368700002002378700001502398700002202413700001902435700001602454700001202470700001502482700001702497700001502514700002302529773009902552856005502651852000902706655001202715IND4468162120221117183723.0120727e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446816212DNAL7 a221179302pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-294X.2011.05361.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGAMBA, C.10aAncient DNA from an Early Neolithic Iberian population supports a pioneer colonization by first farmers  ap. 45-56.  aThe Neolithic transition has been widely debated particularly regarding the extent to which this revolution implied a demographic expansion from the Near East. We attempted to shed some light on this process in northeastern Iberia by combining ancient DNA (aDNA) data from Early Neolithic settlers and published DNA data from Middle Neolithic and modern samples from the same region. We successfully extracted and amplified mitochondrial DNA from 13 human specimens, found at three archaeological sites dated back to the Cardial culture in the Early Neolithic (Can Sadurní and Chaves) and to the Late Early Neolithic (Sant Pau del Camp). We found that haplogroups with a low frequency in modern populations—N* and X1—are found at higher frequencies in our Early Neolithic population (∼31%). Genetic differentiation between Early and Middle Neolithic populations was significant (FST∼0.13, P < 10−5), suggesting that genetic drift played an important role at this time. To improve our understanding of the Neolithic demographic processes, we used a Bayesian coalescence‐based simulation approach to identify the most likely of three demographic scenarios that might explain the genetic data. The three scenarios were chosen to reflect archaeological knowledge and previous genetic studies using similar inferential approaches. We found that models that ignore population structure, as previously used in aDNA studies, are unlikely to explain the data. Our results are compatible with a pioneer colonization of northeastern Iberia at the Early Neolithic characterized by the arrival of small genetically distinctive groups, showing cultural and genetic connections with the Near East.  aPublisher supplied data 3afarmers 3agenetic drift 3agenetic variation 3amitochondrial DNA 3amodels 3apopulation structure 2aAgriculturexhistory 2aArchaeology 2aDNA, Mitochondrialxgeneticsxhistory. 2aGenetic Drift 2aHaplotypesxgenetics 2aHistory, Ancient 2aHumans 2aPhylogeographyxhistory 3aMiddle East 0aMiddle East 0aSpain1 aFernández, E.,1 aTIRADO, M.1 aDEGUILLOUX, M.

Phylogenetic analysis based on its 16S rRNA gene sequence placed the isolate into the genus Fontibacillus with Fontibacillus panacisegetis KCTC 13564ᵀ its closest relative with 97.1 % identity. The isolate was observed to be a Gram-positive, motile and sporulating rod. The catalase test was negative and oxidase was weak. The strain was found to reduce nitrate to nitrite and to produce β-galactosidase but the production of gelatinase, caseinase, urease, arginine dehydrolase, ornithine or lysine decarboxylase was negative. Acetoin production and aesculin hydrolysis were found to be positive. Growth was observed to be supported by many carbohydrates and organic acids as carbon source. MK-7 was identified as the predominant menaquinone and the major fatty acid (43.7 %) as anteiso-C₁₅:₀, as occurs in the other species of the genus Fontibacillus. Strain BAPVE7Bᵀ displayed a complex lipid profile consisting of diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, four glycolipids, four phospholipids, two lipids, two aminolipids and an aminophospholipid. Mesodiaminopimelic acid was detected in the peptidoglycan. The G+C content was determined to be 45.6 mol% (Tm). Phylogenetic, chemotaxonomic and phenotypic analyses showed that strain BAPVE7Bᵀ should be considered a new species of genus Fontibacillus, for which the name Fontibacillus phaseoli sp. nov. is proposed (type strain, LMG 27589ᵀ, CECT 8333ᵀ).  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhaseolus vulgaris 3aacetoin 3aarginine 3acarbon 3acatalase 3achemotaxonomy 3aesculin 3afatty acids 3aglycolipids 3ahydrolysis 3alipid composition 3alysine decarboxylase 3amenaquinones 3anew species 3anitrates 3anitrites 3anucleotide sequences 3aornithine 3apeptidoglycans 3aphenotype 3aphospholipids 3aphylogeny 3aurease 3aSpain1 aMulas, Rebeca1 aRamírez-Bahena, Martha-Helena1 aCuesta, María José1 aRivas, Raúl1 aBrañas, Javier1 aMulas, Daniel1 aGonzález-Andrés, Fernando1 aPeix, Alvaro1 aVelázquez, Encarna0 tAntonie van Leeuwenhoek.g2014 Jan., v. 105, no. 1 p.23-28dSpringer Netherlandsx0003-60727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10482-013-0049-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01884naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245018400163300001600347520097800363592002801341650001301369650001401382650002001396700001401416700002201430773009701452856004801549852000901597655001201606IND50074097520221120071345.0140319e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007409752DNAL7 a10.1007/s13744-013-0179-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ada Silva, M14aThe Usefulness of the Sting Apparatus in Phylogenetic Reconstructions in Vespids, with Emphasis on the Epiponini: More Support for the Single Origin of Eusociality in the Vespidae  ap. 134-142.  aThis study aimed at testing the utility of characters derived from chitinous structures of the sting apparatus for elucidating relationships among the genera of Epiponini. The characters were obtained from the spiracular and quadrate plates, gonostylus, and sting. The data matrix was analyzed using parsimony with equal and implied weighting. Sting characters were also optimized on the tree of Wenzel & Carpenter (1994). Consensus of analysis using equal weights parsimony resulted in a tree with low resolution, but the use of implied weighting improved the results and a consensus tree with a better resolution was obtained. Implied weighting analysis showed an interesting result with Vespinae and Epiponini (the taxa that present the highest degree of sociality) together in a clade. The overall uniformity in morphology of sting apparatus and a possible influence of sociality on morphology could explain these results. The evolution of some characters is discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVespidae 3aphylogeny 3asting apparatus1 aNoll, F B1 aCarpenter, J.

Epimedii Folium is an important source of α-glucosidase inhibitors (AGIs), however bioactive compounds and pharmacological mechanisms remained unclear. In this study, a novel strategy was established, which harnessed α-glucosidase functionalized magnetic beads to fish out potential AGIs, followed by UPLC-MS/MS analysis for their identification. Furthermore, molecular docking was employed to predict binding patterns between the AGIs and the enzyme, and IC₅₀ values was estimated as well. After response surface methodology optimization, the highest activity of Fe₃O₄@α-glucosidase has been achieved when 1.17 mg/mL of α-glucosidase was immobilized in phosphate buffer (pH 6.81) for 4.22 h. Moreover, eight flavonoids were fished out from the extract of Epimedii Folium, and then identified to be epimedin A, epimedin B, epimedin C, icariin, sagittatoside A, sagittatoside B, 2"-O-rhamnosyl icariside II and baohuoside I. All of them were further confirmed to be AGIs through in vitro inhibitory assay and molecular docking. Among those, baohuoside I and sagittatoside B possessed stronger inhibitory activity than acarbose. The approach has a significant prospect in conveniently screening bioactive compounds that target various receptors, which provided an efficient platform for new drug development from natural products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacarbose 3adrug development 3aicariin 3aligands 3amagnetism 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3apH 3aphosphates 3aresponse surface methodology 0aLigand fishing 0aMagnetic nanoparticles 0aMolecular docking 0aα-Glucosidase inhibitors 0aEpimedii folium1 aWang, Man1 aZhou, Jinwei1 aChen, Yufei1 aWu, Mengru1 aYang, Zhangzhong1 aChengyu, Yang,1 aXia, Guohua1 aTam, James P.1 aZhou, Cunshan1 aYang, Huan1 aJia, Xiaobin0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2020 Dec. 15, v. 165 p.1361-1372dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2020.10.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02969naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001800137245013300155300001800288520173300306592002802039650002802067650001102095650002002106650000902126650001502135650001402150650001002164650001302174650002002187650001202207650001102219650001702230653001702247653002502264653001302289700001902302700002502321773012102346856007102467852000902538655001202547IND60745706120221120051444.0210723s2021    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074570612DNAL7 a10.1071/MF203052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSephid, Hesam10aSexual development and maturity of the male brown banded bamboo shark, Chiloscyllium punctatum (Elasmobranchii : Hemiscylliidae)  ap. 1160-1172.  aThe present study aimed to assess the reproductive biology of male brown banded bamboo shark (Chiloscyllium punctatum). Morphological and histological changes in the reproductive tract and changes in gonad steroid testosterone were assessed in 110 male C. punctatum collected from Bahrakan Creek between January 2018 and March 2019. The reproductive tract in male C. punctatum consisted of a pair of testes, efferent ducts, epididymidis, ductus deferens, seminal vesicles, Leydig gland and claspers. Four sexual development stages were determined: (1) immature, no calcified claspers (2) maturing, partially calcified claspers; (3) active and resting adults. Both adult resting and active stages had calcified claspers. In this study, immature male C. punctatum without calcified claspers were found from August to October, maturing C. punctatum with partially calcified claspers were found from November to January and adult C. punctatum caught from February to April were active with calcified claspers, whereas adult fish collected from May to July and during the rest of the year (until mid-January in the following year) were in the resting stage with inactive testes. The testis had a lobular structure and the spermatocysts were arranged diametrically (i.e. along the cross-sectional width of the testis) in each lobule. Plasma testosterone concentrations were associated with histomorphological changes in the reproductive tract. Testosterone concentrations peaked in March in active males and then decreased significantly in resting males. Overall, the variations in the reproductive organs during different sexual maturity stages were consistent with their roles in the production, movement and release of spermatozoa.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChiloscyllium punctatum 3aadults 3aductus deferens 3afish 3afreshwater 3ahistology 3amales 3aresearch 3asexual maturity 3astreams 3atestes 3atestosterone 0abamboo shark 0areproductive biology 0asteroids1 aSalamat, Negin1 aSalari, Mohammad Ali0 tMarine & freshwater research.g2021, v. 72, no. 8 p.1160-1172dCSIRO PublishingwJournal:jnl3957320x1323-16507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/MF203053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02141naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002600188245010500214300001200319506007600331520071700407592002801124506003701152650001501189650002501204650002001229650001601249650001101265650001101276650001601287650002601303650001401329700002001343700002001363700001901383700002101402700002001423700002401443700002101467773010501488856008101593852000901674655001201683IND60119298320221207082409.0150411e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011929832DNAL7 a10.1186/s13059-014-0503-22doi7 aPMC42835802pmcid7 a255995642pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFortin, Jean-Philippe10aFunctional normalization of 450k methylation array data improves replication in large cancer studies  ap. 503.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWe propose an extension to quantile normalization that removes unwanted technical variation using control probes.

In addition, poor nutrition status may lead to sarcopenia and physical frailty in KOA and is negatively associated with surgery outcome after TKR. This study investigated the effects of sarcopenic obesity and its confounding factors on recovery in range of motion (ROM) after total knee replacement (TKR) in older adults with KOA. A total of 587 older adults, aged ≥60 years, who had a diagnosis of KOA and underwent TKR, were enrolled in this retrospective cohort study. Sarcopenia and obesity were defined based on cutoff values of appendicular mass index and body mass index for Asian people. Based on the sarcopenia and obesity definitions, patients were classified into three body-composition groups before TKR: sarcopenic-obese, obese, and non-obese. All patients were asked to attend postoperative outpatient follow-up admissions. Knee flexion ROM was measured before and after surgery. A ROM cutoff of 125 degrees was used to identify poor recovery post-surgery. Kaplan-Meier curve analysis was performed to measure the probability of poor ROM recovery among study groups. Cox multivariate regression models were established to calculate the hazard ratios (HRs) of postoperative poor ROM recovery, using potential confounding factors including age, sex, comorbidity, risk of malnutrition, preoperative ROM, and outpatient follow-up duration as covariates. Analyses results showed that patients in the obese and sarcopenic-obese groups had a higher probability of poor ROM recovery compared to the non-obese group (all p < 0.001). Among all body-composition groups, the sarcopenic-obese group yielded the highest risk of postoperative physical difficulty (adjusted HR = 1.63, p = 0.03), independent to the potential confounding factors. Sarcopenic obesity is likely at the high risk of poor ROM outcome following TKR in older individuals with KOA.  aPublisher supplied data 3abody composition 3abody mass index 3acohort studies 3acomorbidity 3amalnutrition 3anutritional status 3aobesity 3aosteoarthritis 3aprostheses 3aretrospective studies 3arisk 3asarcopenia 3asurgery1 aHuang, Shiwei,1 aHuang, Yu-Yun 1 aLin, Che-Li 0 tNutrients.g2021 Oct. 27, v. 13, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu131138173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03138naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100005400145245014000199300001600339500002000355520167500375592002802050596006302078596006302141650002402204650001902228650002602247650001002273650001302283650001002296650001802306650002602324650002202350650001702372700001802389700002102407700002002428700001302448700001802461700001502479773010902494856008002603852000902683655001202692IND60790291020221119025241.0220824e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079029102DNAL7 a10.1002/2211-5463.121982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Xin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8561-692810aDown‐regulation of miR‐146a‐5p and its potential targets in hepatocellular carcinoma validated by a TCGA‐ and GEO‐based study  ap. 504-521.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aOur previous research has demonstrated that miR‐146a‐5p is down‐regulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and might play a tumor‐suppressive role. In this study, we sought to validate the decreased expression with a larger cohort and to explore potential molecular mechanisms. GEO and TCGA databases were used to gather miR‐146a‐5p expression data in HCC, which included 762 HCC and 454 noncancerous liver tissues. A meta‐analysis of the GEO‐based microarrays, TCGA‐based RNA‐seq data, and additional qRT‐PCR data validated the down‐regulation of miR‐146a‐5p in HCC and no publication bias was observed. Integrated genes were generated by overlapping miR‐146a‐5p‐related genes from predicted and formerly reported HCC‐related genes using natural language processing. The overlaps were comprehensively analyzed to discover the potential gene signatures, regulatory pathways, and networks of miR‐146a‐5p in HCC. A total of 251 miR‐146a‐5p potential target genes were predicted by bioinformatics platforms and 104 genes were considered as both HCC‐ and miR‐146a‐5p‐related overlaps. RAC1 was the most connected hub gene for miR‐146a‐5p and four pathways with high enrichment (VEGF signaling pathway, adherens junction, toll‐like receptor signaling pathway, and neurotrophin signaling pathway) were denoted for the overlapped genes. The down‐regulation of miR‐146a‐5p in HCC has been validated with the most complete data possible. The potential gene signatures, regulatory pathways, and networks identified for miR‐146a‐5p in HCC could prove useful for molecular‐targeted diagnostics and therapeutics.  aPublisher supplied data  aNSFC81560489cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aNSFC81360327cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aToll-like receptors 3abioinformatics 3adiagnostic techniques 3agenes 3ahepatoma 3aliver 3ameta-analysis 3amicroarray technology 3asequence analysis 3atherapeutics1 aYe, Zhi‐hua1 aLiang, Hai‐wei1 aRen, Fang‐hui1 aLi, Ping1 aDang, Yi‐wu1 aChen, Gang0 tFEBS Open Bio.g2017 Apr., v. 7, no. 4 p.504-521dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:23386x2211-54637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2211-5463.121983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02353naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245010200165300001800267520103700285592002801322650002601350650002401376650002101400650001001421650001101431650000901442650001301451650001801464650001101482650001201493650001801505650003801523700001701561700001801578700001601596700001801612700001701630700001301647700001701660700001701677773011101694856008101805852000901886655001201895IND60555808020221119043612.0161029e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055580802DNAL7 a10.1007/s00436-016-5178-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Jianxin10aRecombinant T2 RNase protein of Schistosoma japonicum inhibits expression of α-SMA in LX-2 cells  ap. 4055-4060.  aRecombinant T2 RNase glycoprotein, which showed a certain degree of homology to Omega-1 from Schistosoma mansoni eggs, was expressed in adult worms of Schistosoma japonicum, but not in eggs of S. japonicum. The direct biological role of the recombinant T2 RNase protein in activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) remains unknown. In the present study, the immortalized human HSC line (LX-2 cells) was treated with the recombinant T2 RNase protein at indicated concentrations for various time points in vitro. The expression levels of α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and Smad4 were detected by Western blot. The results showed that the recombinant T2 RNase protein significantly diminished the expression levels of α-SMA and Smad4 in LX-2 cells. The upregulated expression levels of α-SMA and Smad4 by TGF-β1 in LX-2 cells were both suppressed by the recombinant T2 RNase protein. These data suggest that the recombinant T2 RNase protein may be a potential target of therapeutic strategy for the treatment of hepatic fibrosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSchistosoma japonicum 3aSchistosoma mansoni 3aWestern blotting 3aactin 3aadults 3aeggs 3afibrosis 3aglycoproteins 3ahumans 3amuscles 3aribonucleases 3atransforming growth factor beta 11 aPeng, Wenxia1 aFeng, Jinrong1 aZhu, Dandan1 aChen, Jinling1 aSun, Xiaolei1 aLyu, Lei1 aJu, Shaoqing1 aDuan, Yinong0 tParasitology research.g2016 Oct., v. 115, no. 10 p.4055-4060dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0932-01137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-016-5178-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01815naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003100150245010500181300001400286520079000300592002801090650001201118650001101130650001301141650001501154650001701169651001001186700002401196700002701220700002101247700002501268773009101293856008401384852000901468655001201477IND60085971420221122014101.0141101e20120717xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008597142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.quaint.2011.05.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTheodorakopoulou, Katerina10aSedimentological response to Holocene climate events in the Istron area, Gulf of Mirabello, NE Crete  ap. 62-73.  aThis paper aims to reveal the depositional environment of Istron and its sedimentological response to Holocene climatic events.

Detailed fieldwork and sampling by drilling cores in the coastal area provided samples for further analytical studies. The identification of the stratigraphy and the distinction of sedimentological units provided evidence for landscape evolution of the coastal area. Changes of sedimentation rates determined by optical dating and sedimentological analysis were also correlated with Holocene climatic phases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3acoasts 3adrilling 3alandscapes 3astratigraphy 3aCrete1 aPavlopoulos, Kosmas1 aAthanassas, Constantin1 aZacharias, Nikos1 aBasiakos, Iōannēs,0 tQuaternary international.g2012 July 17, v. 266 p.62-73dElsevier Ltdx1040-61827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2011.05.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01829naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001300145245010100158300001600259500002000275520079900295592002801094650002001122650001001142650001901152650001301171650001901184650002001203700001301223700001501236700001501251700001501266773010901281856008001390852000901470655001201479IND60790291120221119025344.0220824e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079029112DNAL7 a10.1002/2211-5463.121622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Yi10aAZD0530 sensitizes drug‐resistant ALK‐positive lung cancer cells by inhibiting SRC signaling  ap. 472-476.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aMost tumors develop resistance to targeted cancer drugs, even though these drugs have produced substantial clinical responses. Here we established anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)‐positive drug‐resistant lung cancer cell lines, which are resistant to ceritinib (LDK378). We found that ceritinib treatment resulted in robust upregulation of SRC activity, as measured by the phosphorylation of the SRC substrate paxillin. Knockdown of SRC alone with siRNA effectively sensitized ceritinib resistance in ALK‐positive cells. Furthermore, SRC inhibition by AZD0530 was effective in ALK‐resistant cancer cells. Thus, ALK inhibition by ceritinib may lead to upregulation of SRC signaling, and AZD0530 could serve as a potential drug in the clinic to treat ALK‐resistant lung cancer patients.  aPublisher supplied data 3adrug resistance 3adrugs 3alung neoplasms 3alymphoma 3aneoplasm cells 3aphosphorylation1 aYang, Yi1 aXu, Yunhua1 aLü, Shun,1 aJian, Hong0 tFEBS Open Bio.g2017 Apr., v. 7, no. 4 p.472-476dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:23386x2211-54637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2211-5463.121623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03578naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245007900163520215100242592002802393650001902421650000802440650001202448650001002460650002402470650001402494650001502508650001402523650001602537650001402553650002402567650001702591651001002608653002402618653001502642653000902657653001002666653003502676700001402711700002902725700001702754700001702771700001602788700001502804700001402819700001702833773011602850856008502966852000903051655001203060IND60741218820221119133656.0220606e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074121882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.meegid.2021.1049682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXia, Gao10aTreated with interferon and the gene polymorphism of CGRP and its receptor  aThis case-control study aims to investigate the relationship of polymorphisms of four gene loci (CGRP rs155209 and rs3781719, RAMP1 rs3754701 and rs7590387) with the prognosis of interferon therapy for chronic hepatitis B (CHB). A total of 317 CHB patients receiving interferon alone for the first time were recruited in northern China, and peripheral blood samples were obtained. The single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in rs155209, rs3781719, rs3754701, and rs7590387 were genotyped using Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). Univariate and multivariate logistic regression methods were employed to assess the correlation between CHB prognosis treated with interferon and polymorphisms of these gene loci. The study clearly demonstrated the relevance of polymorphisms of rs155209, rs3781719, rs3754701, and rs7590387 with DNA response and ALT response after interferon treatment. CHB patients with CGRP rs155209C had a lower risk of developing DNA response (CT vs. TT: OR = 0.159, 95% CI = 0.086–0.294, Pₐdⱼ < 0.001; CC vs. TT: OR = 0.131, 95% CI = 0.059–0.288, Pₐdⱼ < 0.001), as well as a lower risk of developing ALT response (CT vs. TT: OR = 0.530, 95% CI = 0.323–0.869, Pₐdⱼ < 0.05). Moreover, CHB patients with RAMP1 rs3754701T allele were more prone to develop DNA response (AT vs. AA: OR = 2.061, 95% CI = 1.237–3.435, Pₐdⱼ < 0.05; TT vs. AA: OR = 5.676, 95% CI =1.247–25.837, Pₐdⱼ < 0.05), and they also more likely to develop ALT response (AT vs. AA: OR = 1.766, 95% CI = 1.098–2.840, Pₐdⱼ < 0.05). We did not find a significant association between CGRP rs3781719 or RAMP1 rs7590387 and DNA response or ALT response. This study revealed that CGRP rs155209 and RAMP1 rs3754701 polymorphisms, but not CGRP rs3781719 and RAMP1 rs7590387, were correlated with interferon therapy prognosis for CHB in Han Chinese population, and RAMP1 rs3754701T was a protective factor for ALT response and DNA response, but CGRP rs155209C carriers were less prone to DNA and ALT responses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChinese people 3aDNA 3aalleles 3ablood 3achronic hepatitis B 3aevolution 3agenotyping 3ainfection 3ainterferons 3aprognosis 3aregression analysis 3atherapeutics 3aChina 0aChronic hepatitis B 0aInterferon 0aCGRP 0aRAMP1 0aSingle nucleotide polymorphism1 aLi, Zhang1 aLin, Zhou,dactive 1978-1 aXuRan, Zheng1 aMengRu, Yang1 aNing, Zhang1 aGang, Yang1 aLei, Yang1 aWenxuan, Liu0 tInfection, genetics, and evolution.g2021 Sept., v. 93 p.104968-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12450x1567-13487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2021.1049683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02434naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245020700165300001600372520117400388592002801562650002601590650002701616650002301643650003001666650002101696650001001717650000901727650001401736650001501750650001601765650001201781650001301793650001601806651001101822700001901833700001801852773009701870856004801967852000902015655001202024IND50074098020221120060107.0140319e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007409802DNAL7 a10.1007/s13744-013-0189-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFoerster, M R10aTemperature-Dependent Parasitism, Survival, and Longevity of Five Species of Trichogramma Westwood (Hymenoptera: Trichogrammatidae) Associated with Anticarsia gemmatalis Hübner (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae)  ap. 176-182.  aEgg parasitoids of the genus Trichogramma Westwood play an important role in the control of the velvetbean caterpillar Anticarisa gemmatalis Hübner in soybean crops in Southern Brazil.

In this context, this study evaluated the effects of five constant temperatures ranging from 14 to 30°C on parasitism, age-specific survival, progeny production and longevity of Trichogramma pretiosum Riley, Trichogramma atopovirilia Oatman & Platner, Trichogramma acacioi Brun, Moraes & Soares, Trichogramma lasallei Pinto, and Trichogramma rojasi Nagaraja & Nagarkatti. We demonstrate that temperature differently affected the species of Trichogramma investigated when using eggs of the velvetbean caterpillar. We also demonstrate that T. pretiosum and T. atopovirilia are better adapted to a wide range of temperatures than the other species evaluated, and are therefore better suited as biocontrol agents for applied biological control programs of A. gemmatalis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnticarsia gemmatalis 3aTrichogramma pretiosum 3abiological control 3abiological control agents 3aclimatic factors 3acrops 3aeggs 3alongevity 3aparasitism 3aparasitoids 3aprogeny 3asoybeans 3atemperature 3aBrazil1 aMarchioro, C A1 aFoerster, L A0 tNeotropical entomology.g2014 Apr., v. 43, no. 2 p.176-182dSpringer-Verlagx1519-566X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13744-013-0189-2  aDNAL 7aarticle02191naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245009200170300001400262520108500276592002801361650001101389650002301400650001601423650001301439650001401452650001501466651001501481651001101496700002401507700002701531700002601558700002901584700002001613773009101633856008401724852000901808655001201817IND60085971620221122053655.0141101e20120717xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008597162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.quaint.2011.08.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEvelpidou, Niki10aHolocene palaeogeographical reconstruction of the western part of Naxos island (Greece)  ap. 81-93.  aNaxos Island is situated in the Cycladic plateau (middle Aegean Sea) and consists of concaved beach zones separated by small headlands. This study investigates the diachronic palaeo-shoreline shift due to the sea level change and its effect to the palaeo-environmental evolution of the western coastal part of Naxos Island during the Late Holocene. For this purpose, six boreholes were drilled and dated using radiocarbon techniques. The associated geomorphological, sedimentological and paleontological investigation concluded that during Late Holocene, the embayments of Naxos western coastal part were frequently exposed, and their communication with the sea was not perennial. The coastal area was wider with many active lagoons and embayment changing from shallow marine environment to coastal environment frequently alternating to brackish mesohaline one. The former sea-level position in western Naxos island should be between −1.5 m and −2 m during the last 2000 years, which may partly reflect eustatic processes and partly a gradual or coseismic land subsidence.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoasts 3amarine environment 3amethodology 3aplateaus 3asea level 3asubsidence 3aAegean Sea 3aGreece1 aPavlopoulos, Kosmas1 aVassilopoulos, Andreas1 aTriantaphyllou, Maria1 aVouvalidis, Konstantinos1 aSyrides, George0 tQuaternary international.g2012 July 17, v. 266 p.81-93dElsevier Ltdx1040-61827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2011.08.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02947naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245014200164520157700306592002801883650001801911650001001929650001201939650001901951650002001970650001401990650002102004650001302025650001602038650003302054650001102087650001602098650001702114650001202131650002802143650001302171653002102184653002702205653001902232653002802251700002102279773009802300856008202398852000902480655001202489IND60737646220221120220738.0220906e20210715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073764622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lfs.2021.1196072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Cho-Won10aEffects of anticancer drugs on the cardiac mitochondrial toxicity and their underlying mechanisms for novel cardiac protective strategies  aMitochondria are organelles that play a pivotal role in the production of energy in cells, and vital to the maintenance of cellular homeostasis due to the regulation of many biochemical processes. The heart contains a lot of mitochondria because those muscles require a lot of energy to keep supplying blood through the circulatory system, implying that the energy generated from mitochondria is highly dependent. Thus, cardiomyocytes are sensitive to mitochondrial dysfunction and are likely to be targeted by mitochondrial toxic drugs. It has been reported that some anticancer drugs caused unwanted toxicity to mitochondria. Mitochondrial dysfunction is related to aging and the onset of many diseases, such as obesity, diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases. Mitochondrial toxic mechanisms can be mainly explained concerning reactive oxygen species (ROS)/redox status, calcium homeostasis, and endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER) stress signaling. The toxic mechanisms of many anticancer drugs have been revealed, but more studying and understanding of the mechanisms of drug-induced mitochondrial toxicity is required to develop mitochondrial toxicity screening system as well as novel cardioprotective strategies for the prevention of cardiac disorders of drugs. This review focuses on the cardiac mitochondrial toxicity of commonly used anticancer drugs, i.e., doxorubicin, mitoxantrone, cisplatin, arsenic trioxide, and cyclophosphamide, and their possible chemopreventive agents that can prevent or alleviate cardiac mitochondrial toxicity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarsenic oxide 3ablood 3acalcium 3acardiomyocytes 3achemoprevention 3acisplatin 3acyclophosphamide 3adiabetes 3adoxorubicin 3aendoplasmic reticulum stress 3aenergy 3ahomeostasis 3amitochondria 3aobesity 3areactive oxygen species 3atoxicity 0aAnticancer drugs 0aMitochondrial toxicity 0aCardiomyocytes 0aReactive oxygen species1 aChoi, Kyung-Chul0 tLife sciences.g2021 July 15, v. 277 p.119607-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11720x0024-32057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2021.1196073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03806naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245011700169300001800286500001900304520217300323592002802496650002202524650002402546650002502570650003102595650002502626650001902651650001502670650000902685650002002694650001002714650002402724650002002748650001902768650001202787650001202799650001002811650001302821650001202834650004302846650001902889650002502908653001302933653001702946653001502963653001502978653001302993700001303006773013703019856008703156852000903243655001203252IND60713290320221123015417.0201209e20201215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071329032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2020.10.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Chenyang10aMolecular characterization, expression and functional analysis of TGFβ1-b in crucian carp (Carassius carassius)  ap. 1392-1401.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aTransforming growth factor β1 (TGFβ1) is a polyfunctional cytokine with important roles in growth, differentiation and immune function in various animals. In this study, PCR, bioinformatics, real-time quantitative PCR, prokaryotic expression, protein purification and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-TOF-MS) were applied to investigate the structural features and function of TGFβ1-b in crucian carp. The complete coding sequence (CDS) of TGFβ1-b was 1134 bp in length and was submitted to GenBank (ID: MH473141). TGFβ1-b encoded a putative protein of 377 amino acids and included a signal peptide consisting of 22 amino acids. TGFβ1-b was relatively conservative in fish and distant from mammals in terms of evolutionary relationship. TGFβ1-b was found to be expressed in various tissues, with the highest expression in the kidney. The expressions of TGFβ1-b in muscle, heart and liver were increased with the addition of Rhodopseudomonas palustris, Bacillus subtilis and Enterococcus faecium at 30 days (p < 0.01). While, the expressions of SMAD2, SMAD3 and SMAD7 were also up-regulated with the addition of R. palustris at 20 days (p < 0.01). The expression of TGFβ1-b could be affected by time and group factors (p < 0.05). Moreover, the expression vector TGFβ1-b-pDE2 was successfully constructed. Prokaryotic expression indicated that a 43 kDa target protein was obtained after induction with 1.5 mM isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) for 3.5 h at 37 °C for 200 r/h. The activities of alkaline phosphatase and lysozyme in injection TGFβ1-b protein group (ITg) and feeding broken bacterial liquid group (BTg) were significantly increased at 24 h (p < 0.01). And the activities of superoxide dismutase in ITg were significantly increased at 36 h (p < 0.01). Besides, the expressions of heat shock protein 30 and heat shock protein 47 in ITg and BTg were significantly increased (p < 0.01). Whereas, the expression of interleukin-11 was significantly reduced (p < 0.01). These results indicated that TGFβ1-b protein might play a role in immunity of crucian carp.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus subtilis 3aCarassius carassius 3aEnterococcus faecium 3aRhodopseudomonas palustris 3aalkaline phosphatase 3abioinformatics 3adesorption 3afish 3agenetic vectors 3aheart 3aheat shock proteins 3aimmune response 3ainterleukin-11 3akidneys 3aliquids 3aliver 3alysozyme 3amuscles 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asignal peptide 3asuperoxide dismutase 0aTGFβ1-b 0aCrucian carp 0aProbiotics 0aExpression 0aImmunity1 aWang, Li0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2020 Dec. 15, v. 165 p.1392-1401dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2020.10.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02771naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148072000900157072000900166100001600175245012800191300001800319500002400337520127500361650002701636650001101663650001601674650001901690650001901709650002201728650001801750650001401768650002401782650001401806650001901820650001801839651001001857653001401867653002801881700001501909700001701924700001501941773014101956852000902097856008802106930003302194945002502227946001302252655001202265IND4412691020221119002517.0081121e200811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441269102DNAL7 a10.1603/0013-8746-101.6.10032doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF821 0aL300 0aL0011 aMazzoni, V.10aRole of Winter Host Plants in Vineyard Colonization and Phenology of Zygina rhamni (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae: Typhlocybinae)  ap. 1003-1009.  aIncludes references  aZygina rhamni Ferrari (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae: Typhlocybinae) is a mesophyll-feeding leafhopper that infests grapevine, Vitis vinifera L. This leafhopper's overwintering strategy and the dynamics of its vineyard colonization, relative to the distance between the grapevines and the winter host plants and different grapevine vegetative densities, are described herein. This species shows a facultative heteroecious life cycle. In autumn, it migrates from vineyards to bramble, Rubus gr. fruticosus, and rose, Rosa chinensis Jacquin. On these host plants, females lay eggs that start to hatch at the end of March. Adults that developed on bramble colonize grapevines beginning in May; the leaf fall of rose, which takes place during the first half of April, probably causes the death of unhatched eggs and nymphs. We found that overwintering females can move back to vineyards and lay eggs until early June. The dynamics of vineyard colonization by the leafhopper involved initial concentration in areas close to bramble (May-early July) with subsequent, progressive spread through the vineyards, with concentration in areas of high vegetative density. Leafhopper presence was negligible in areas of vineyards with levels of vegetative density below a certain threshold. 3alife cycle (organisms) 3aZygina 3ahost plants 3aRubus plicatus 3aRosa chinensis 3aoviposition sites 3aoverwintering 3aphenology 3apopulation dynamics 3avineyards 3aVitis vinifera 3aplant density 3aItaly 0aheteroecy 0aheteroecious life cycle1 aAnfora, G.1 aIoriatti, C.1 aLucchi, A.0 tAnnals of the Entomological Society of America.g2008 Nov., v. 101, no. 6 p.1003-1009dEntomological Society of Americax0013-87467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603/0013-8746-101.6.10033Available from publisher's Web site  a20081201b20081206c00000000  aINDdNZMe2008/12/01  aOther US 7aarticle03301naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006000151245010200211300001300313520181900326592002802145650002202173650002402195650002002219650001002239650001902249650001502268650001202283650000902295650001002304650002002314650001402334650001402348650001502362650001602377650001902393653002802412653001602440653002502456653002402481653001902505700002302524700002902547773014802576856008602724852000902810655001202819IND60622531920221120103611.0210114e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062253192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anbehav.2018.10.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCoomes, Casey M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9062-431610aElevated temperatures reduce discrimination between conspecific and heterospecific sexual signals  ap. 9-15.  aHeat waves are rapidly increasing in frequency and length around the globe. These periods of elevated temperatures are inducing extreme thermal stress in many organisms. One dramatic result of heat waves is mass mortality events, notably in birds. Although much attention is given to lethal events, little is known about how more common sublethal temperatures affect behaviour, especially in endotherms. For example, male song sparrows, Melospiza melodia atlantica, sing at lower rates at higher temperatures. We hypothesized that simulated heat waves may also reduce the ability of females to discriminate between sexual signals. We tested this hypothesis by quantifying whether female zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata, responded more to conspecific song or heterospecific song while at their typical housing temperature compared to temperatures above their upper critical temperature. We collected data on how often the birds selected conspecific over heterospecific songs and how much effort the birds invested in sampling those songs using a matched-pairs design. During housing temperature trials, females preferred conspecific song compared to heterospecific song. In contrast, females no longer showed a preference for conspecific song at temperatures above their upper critical limit, although the birds invested similar effort in sampling songs in both treatments. Our findings provide the first experimental evidence that high temperatures affect female preference for a mating signal in an endotherm. Our results highlight the need for future work to investigate this overlooked effect of climate change on endotherms. Because thermoregulatory processes are phylogenetically conserved, our results generate useful predictions for future studies of heat wave effects on mating behaviours in endotherms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMelospiza melodia 3aTaeniopygia guttata 3aanimal behavior 3abirds 3aclimate change 3aendothermy 3afemales 3aheat 3amales 3amating behavior 3amortality 3aphylogeny 3aprediction 3atemperature 3athermal stress 0abehavioural performance 0aheat stress 0aoperant conditioning 0aspecies recognition 0athermal stress1 aDanner, Raymond M.1 aDerryberry, Elizabeth P.0 tAnimal behaviour.g2019 Jan., v. 147 p.9-15dElsevier LtdaThe Association for the Study of Animal BehaviourwJournal:jnl45841x0003-34727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2018.10.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02497naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245010400162300001800266520095400284592002801238650001801266650002501284650001701309650001801326650001401344650001701358650001401375700002501389700003001414700002101444700001501465700003401480700002501514700002301539700001901562700002401581700002101605700002701626700001701653700002001670700001801690700001901708700002101727700002701748773013301775856007401908852000901982655001201991IND60745706620221120043120.0210723e20210721xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074570662DNAL7 a10.1039/d0np00030b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJeandet, Philippe10aPhytostilbenes as agrochemicals: biosynthesis, bioactivity, metabolic engineering and biotechnology  ap. 1282-1329.  aAlthough constituting a limited chemical family, phytostilbenes represent an emblematic group of molecules among natural compounds. Ever since their discovery as antifungal compounds in plants and their ascribed role in human health and disease, phytostilbenes have never ceased to arouse interest for researchers, leading to a huge development of the literature in this field. Owing to this, the number of references to this class of compounds has reached the tens of thousands. The objective of this article is thus to offer an overview of the different aspects of these compounds through a large bibliography analysis of more than 500 articles. All the aspects regarding phytostilbenes will be covered including their chemistry and biochemistry, regulation of their biosynthesis, biological activities in plants, molecular engineering of stilbene pathways in plants and microbes as well as their biotechnological production by plant cell systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagrochemicals 3abioactive properties 3abiosynthesis 3abiotechnology 3achemistry 3ahuman health 3astilbenes1 aVannozzi, Alessandro1 aSobarzo-Sanchez, Eduardo,1 aUddin, Md.

The bacterium was observed to be Gram positive, oxidase and catalase positive, rod shaped, and motile by subpolar flagella. The bacterium was found to grow at salinities of 0–12 % and at temperatures of 8–45 °C. The isolate was found to hydrolyze aesculin and gelatin, but was unable to reduce nitrate to nitrite. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that strain HYC-10ᵀ belongs to the genus Bacillus, with highest sequence similarity (99.3 %) to Bacillus aerophilus 28Kᵀ, Bacillus stratosphericus 41KF2aᵀ and Bacillus altitudinis DSM 21631ᵀ, followed by Bacillus safensis DSM 19292ᵀ (99.5 %) and Bacillus pumilus DSM 27ᵀ (99.5 %), while the sequence similarities to others were all below 97.6 %. The genomic ANIm values between strain HYC-10ᵀ and three type strains (B. altitudinis DSM 21631ᵀ, B. safensis DSM 19292ᵀ and B. pumilus DSM 27ᵀ) were determined to range from 89.11 to 91.53 %. The DNA–DNA hybridization estimate values between strain HYC-10ᵀ and the three type strains were from 36.60 to 44.00 %. The principal fatty acids identified were iso-C₁₅:₀ (39.1 %), anteiso-C₁₅:₀ (22.7 %), iso-C₁₇:₀ (13.1 %), C₁₆:₀ (6.1 %), anteiso-C₁₇:₀ (5.8 %) and iso-C₁₆:₀ (5.1 %). The G+C content of the chromosomal DNA was determined from the draft genome sequence to be 41.3 mol%. The respiratory quinone was determined to be MK-7 (100 %). Phosphatidylglycerol, diphosphatidylglycerol, aminoglycolipid, two glycolipids and two unknown phospholipids were found to be present. The combined genotypic and phenotypic data show that strain HYC-10ᵀ represents a novel species of the genus Bacillus, for which the name Bacillus xiamenensis sp. nov. is proposed, with the type strain HYC-10ᵀ (=CGMCC NO.1.12326ᵀ = LMG 27143ᵀ = MCCC 1A00008ᵀ).  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus altitudinis 3aBacillus pumilus 3aBacillus safensis 3aMugil cephalus 3abacteria 3acatalase 3aesculin 3aflagellum 3agelatin 3agenes 3agenomics 3aglycolipids 3aintestines 3amullet 3anitrates 3anitrites 3anucleic acid hybridization 3anucleotide sequences 3aphenotype 3aphospholipids 3aphylogeny 3aquinones 3asequence homology 3aChina1 aLiu, Yang1 aShao, Zongze0 tAntonie van Leeuwenhoek.g2014 Jan., v. 105, no. 1 p.99-107dSpringer Netherlandsx0003-60727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10482-013-0057-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03695naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002900151245015100180520234500331592002802676650001702704650002102721650001402742650001002756650001602766650001902782650001302801650001102814650002902825653002402854653003102878653002602909653002202935653002202957700002802979700002103007700002003028700001903048773011103067856008603178852000903264655001203273IND60741219620221119133426.0210729e20210715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074121962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jchromb.2021.1228212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGonzález-Rubio, Soledad12aA comprehensive study on the performance of different retention mechanisms in sport drug testing by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry  aAnti-doping substances listed by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) include hundreds of compounds of very different physico-chemical properties. Anti-doping control laboratories need to screen all these substances in the so-called Initial Testing Procedures (ITPs) what is very challenging from an analytical point of view. ITPs are mostly based on reversed-phase (RP) liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) using C18 columns, which feature poor retention and peak tailing for polar and basic compounds, respectively. While studies on this field dealing with the comparison of stationary phases are focused on certain chemical classes, this research provides a wide multi-target approach. For this purpose, a representative group of 93 anti-doping agents (log P from −2.4 to 9.2) included in ten different classes of prohibited substances was selected. A comprehensive study on the performance of six columns and four eluents on different separation parameters (retention factors, asymmetry factors, co-elutions, total run times) and matrix effects (signal enhancement or suppression) was performed for LC-MS/MS-based ITPs. Columns working in both RP [C18, C8, phenyl hexyl (PH), pentafluorophenyl (PFP) and mixed-mode hydrophilic/RP (HILIC-RP)) and hydrophilic (HILIC)] modes were investigated. Eluents contained methanol or acetonitrile as organic modifiers, with or without the addition of ammonium acetate. The best column-mobile phase binomial for ITPs was PFP using water-methanol (0.1% formic acid) as eluent, while HILIC was the best option for highly polar non-aromatic anti-doping agents, which were poorly addressed by PFP. Excellent good peak shapes and relative acceptable matrix interferences were obtained for HILIC-RP, which was tested for the first time for the analysis of anti-doping agents, although the number of compounds eluting too fast was too high. On the whole, the alkyl phase C18 showed the worst performance and although C8 and PH were better, their performance did not surpass that of PFP. Possible retention mechanisms underlying separation in the different stationary phases were discussed. This research provides valuable information to anti-doping control labs for improving LC-MS/MS-based ITPs and it proposes PFP as a suitable alternative to the already established C18.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetonitrile 3aammonium acetate 3aasymmetry 3adrugs 3aformic acid 3ahydrophilicity 3amethanol 3asports 3atandem mass spectrometry 0aAnti-doping control 0aInitial testing procedures 0aLiquid chromatography 0aMass spectrometry 0aColumn comparison1 aBallesteros-Gómez, Ana1 aCarreras, Daniel1 aMuñoz, Gloria,1 aRubio, Soledad0 tJournal of chromatography.g2021 July 15, v. 1178 p.122821-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12459x1570-02327nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jchromb.2021.1228213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02878naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245016000167300001800327520157600345592002801921650002201949650001201971650000901983650001401992650002502006650002402031650001702055650001702072650001802089651001002107700001802117700001502135700002002150700002202170700002802192700001702220700002002237773010902257856008102366852000902447655001202456IND60081322120221118233130.0150217e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008132212DNAL7 a10.1007/s10641-013-0199-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaker, Laurie L10aReproductive ecology of the female pink cusk-eel (Genypterus blacodes): evaluating differences between fishery management zones in the Chilean austral zone  ap. 1083-1093.  aThe pink cusk-eel (Genypterus blacodes), a benthic-demersal fish confined to the southern hemisphere, supports an important commercial fishery in Chile where it is exploited over an extensive geographic area. Although the fishery was originally divided into a northern (41º28′–47º00′S) and southern (47º00′–57º00′S) zone for the purposes of fisheries management, recent studies have reported significant differences in life history parameters between these zones. Individuals from the southern zone reached larger asymptotic sizes and possessed higher survival rates compared to the northern zone. We estimate and compare the gonadosomatic index (GSI), shape of the maturity ogive, and length at 50 % maturity (L ₅₀%) of female G. blacodes between management zones and across time using biological data collected from the industrial fleet between 1985 and 2009. Females in the northern zone had higher monthly mean GSI than females in the southern zone. Our analyses also revealed L ₅₀%to be significantly higher in the southern zone than in the northern zone from 1985 to 2009. The significant differences in life-history traits between fishery management zones agree with the trade-offs predicted by Charnov’s life history theory. Together these results provide additional support for the hypothesis that two separate stocks exist and suggest that females from the northern zone have developed a life-history strategy, which favours early maturation and a proportionally greater investment in reproduction than females from the southern zone.  aPublisher supplied data 3aearly development 3afemales 3afish 3afisheries 3afisheries management 3agonadosomatic index 3alife history 3areproduction 3asurvival rate 3aChile1 aWiff, Rodrigo1 aQuiroz, JC1 aFlores, Andrés1 aCéspedes, Renato1 aBarrientos, Mauricio A.1 aOjeda, Vilma1 aGatica, Claudio0 tEnvironmental biology of fishes.g2014 Oct., v. 97, no. 10 p.1083-1093dSpringer-Verlagx0378-19097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10641-013-0199-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02995naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002200145245010000167300001600267500002000283520160900303592002801912596006001940596004702000650002102047650001602068650001902084650002402103650001702127650001602144650001002160650001302170650001102183650002702194650001902221650001702240650002102257700002102278700002102299700003102320773010902351856008002460852000902540655001202549IND60790291620221119025251.0220824e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079029162DNAL7 a10.1002/2211-5463.122052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRogowski, Michael10aUptake of 3‐iodothyronamine hormone analogs inhibits the growth and viability of cancer cells  ap. 587-601.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  a3‐Iodothyronamine (T1AM) is a structural analog of thyroid hormone that has been demonstrated to have potent affects on numerous physiological systems. Most studies on T1AM have explored its effects in healthy functional systems; while its potential therapeutic uses and safety, and efficacy in pathological conditions are largely unknown. We sought to evaluate the effects of T1AM and its structural analog SG‐2 on cancer cell growth and viability. We analyzed the cytotoxicity of these analogs on MCF7 breast cancer cells, HepG2 hepatocellular cancer cells as well as normal control cells using primary human foreskin fibroblasts and mouse preadipocytes control cells. The cytotoxicity of T1AM and SG‐2 was determined by cell growth curves, and validated by 3‐(4,5‐dimethylthiazol‐2‐yl)‐2,5‐diphenyltetrazolium bromide cell viability assays. Cellular uptake analysis was conducted using confocal microscopy. Real‐time (RT)‐PCR was conducted to identify gene pathways affected by SG‐2 in cancer cells. The IC₅₀ of T1AM was approximately double the concentration of its analog SG‐2 in cancer cells. Cytotoxicity studies on normal cells revealed that IC₅₀ concentrations of SG‐2 in cancer cells had no significant impact on cell viability in these cell types. Cell‐imaging experiments demonstrated rapid uptake and localization to the mitochondrial membrane. T1AM and SG‐2 are able to reduce cancer cell growth and viability. These findings support the potential for use of these compounds and related analogs for their antiproliferation properties in cancer cells.  aPublisher supplied data  aR01 DC009018cNational Institutes of Health (NIH/NIDCD)  cAchievement Rewards for College Scientists 3abreast neoplasms 3acell growth 3acell viability 3aconfocal microscopy 3acytotoxicity 3afibroblasts 3agenes 3ahepatoma 3ahumans 3amitochondrial membrane 3aneoplasm cells 3atherapeutics 3athyroid hormones1 aGollahon, Lauren1 aChellini, Grazia1 aAssadi‐Porter, Fariba M.0 tFEBS Open Bio.g2017 Apr., v. 7, no. 4 p.587-601dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:23386x2211-54637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2211-5463.122053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02315naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245012400167520087700291592002801168650001301196650002001209650001201229650001901241650001101260650001901271650002001290650001401310653002701324653002101351653001201372653002401384653001701408653002901425700001801454700002001472700001701492700001301509700001801522700001501540700001601555700002101571700001801592700001701610773009801627856008701725852000901812655001201821IND60782784520221119172151.0220824e20221001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078278452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2022.1196392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Chao12aA two-stage circulated fluidized bed process to minimize tar generation of biomass gasification for fuel gas production  aThis study tested a two-stage circulated fluidized bed process consisting of a downer for pyrolysis of biomass and a riser for char gasification and tar removal to produce fuel gas containing tar below 100 mg/Nm³ from pine chips using steam-oxygen (not N₂-oxygen) as the agent. A pilot facility treating 15 kg/h biomass was run at different equivalent ratios (ERs) and steam-to-biomass ratios (S/Bs). Under the typical conditions of S/B = 0.15 and ER = 0.3, the produced fuel gas contained (in volume) 21.64% CO, 21.97% CO₂, 15.34% H₂, 18.59% CH₄, 1.49% CₙHₘ and 1.83 g/Nm³db tar. A long-tern running of the pilot pant realized a tar content low as 95.5 mg/Nm³db in the produced gas.

The aim of this study is to discuss the mechanism of microRNA-146a-3p (miR-146a-3p)/histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1)/Krüppel-like factor 5 (KLF5)/inhibitors of kappa B α (IKBα) signal axis in plaque formation of AS mice.ApoE⁻/⁻ mice were fed with high-fat feed for 12 weeks to establish AS mice model. The expression of miR-146a-3p, KLF5, HDAC1 and IKBα in aortic wall tissues of AS mice was tested. The targeting relationship between miR-146a-3p and HDAC1 was verified. AS mice were injected with miR-146a-3p antagomir or HDAC1 overexpression to verify the impacts of miR-146a-3p and HDAC1 on blood lipids and inflammatory factors in serum, aortic wall apoptotic cells, antioxidant stress capacity and the plaque area in AS mice. VECs proliferation and apoptosis were also measured in vitro.miR-146a-3p and KLF5 were increased while HDAC1 and IKBα were reduced in aortic wall tissues of AS mice. miR-146a-3p directly targeted to HDAC1. Depletion of miR-146a-3p or restoration of HDAC1 was correlated to lower plasma lipid level, reduced inflammatory factors in serum, attenuated aortic wall apoptosis, increased antioxidant stress capacity and improved the stability of pathological plaque of AS mice. miR-146a-3p down-regulation or HDAC1 up-regulation promoted VECs proliferation and inhibited apoptosis.Functional studies show that depleted miR-146a-3p advances HDAC1 and IKBα expression as well as inhibits KLF5 expression to facilitate the stability of pathological plaques in AS mice.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidants 3aapoptosis 3aatherosclerosis 3ablood lipids 3ablood serum 0aAtherosclerosis 0aMicroRNA-146a-3p 0aHistone deacetylase 1 0aKrüppel-like factor 5 0aInhibitors of kappa B α 0aPlaque area1 aWang, Hongwei1 aMa, Jiangwei1 aQiao, Zengyong1 aZhang, Li1 aGe, Guanghao0 tLife sciences.g2021 Nov. 01, v. 284 p.119615-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11720x0024-32057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2021.1196153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04282naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002100188245009300209300001600302506007600318520311800394592002803512506003703540650001203577650002203589650002903611650002003640650001403660650001303674650001503687650001403702650001503716773008703731856008103818852000903899655001203908IND60119299120221207092427.0141211e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011929912DNAL7 a10.1007/s00709-013-0600-12doi7 aPMC39270622pmcid7 a243903112pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHoenger, Andreas10aHigh-resolution cryo-electron microscopy on macromolecular complexes and cell organelles  ap. 417-427.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCryo-electron microscopy techniques and computational 3-D reconstruction of macromolecular assemblies are tightly linked tools in modern structural biology. This symbiosis has produced vast amounts of detailed information on the structure and function of biological macromolecules. Typically, one of two fundamentally different strategies is used depending on the specimens and their environment. A: 3-D reconstruction based on repetitive and structurally identical unit cells that allow for averaging, and B: tomographic 3-D reconstructions where tilt-series between approximately ±60 and ±70° at small angular increments are collected from highly complex and flexible structures that are beyond averaging procedures, at least during the first round of 3-D reconstruction. Strategies of group A are averaging-based procedures and collect large number of 2-D projections at different angles that are computationally aligned, averaged together, and back-projected in 3-D space to reach a most complete 3-D dataset with high resolution, today often down to atomic detail. Evidently, success relies on structurally repetitive particles and an aligning procedure that unambiguously determines the angular relationship of all 2-D projections with respect to each other. The alignment procedure of small particles may rely on their packing into a regular array such as a 2-D crystal, an icosahedral (viral) particle, or a helical assembly. Critically important for cryo-methods, each particle will only be exposed once to the electron beam, making these procedures optimal for highest-resolution studies where beam-induced damage is a significant concern. In contrast, tomographic 3-D reconstruction procedures (group B) do not rely on averaging, but collect an entire dataset from the very same structure of interest. Data acquisition requires collecting a large series of tilted projections at angular increments of 1–2° or less and a tilt range of ±60° or more. Accordingly, tomographic data collection exposes its specimens to a large electron dose, which is particularly problematic for frozen-hydrated samples. Currently, cryo-electron tomography is a rapidly emerging technology, on one end driven by the newest developments of hardware such as super-stabile microscopy stages as well as the latest generation of direct electron detectors and cameras. On the other end, success also strongly depends on new software developments on all kinds of fronts such as tilt-series alignment and back-projection procedures that are all adapted to the very low-dose and therefore very noisy primary data. Here, we will review the status quo of cryo-electron microscopy and discuss the future of cellular cryo-electron tomography from data collection to data analysis, CTF-correction of tilt-series, post-tomographic sub-volume averaging, and 3-D particle classification. We will also discuss the pros and cons of plunge freezing of cellular specimens to vitrified sectioning procedures and their suitability for post-tomographic volume averaging despite multiple artifacts that may distort specimens to some degree.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acameras 3acomputer software 3acryo-electron microscopy 3adata collection 3adetectors 3afreezing 3aorganelles 3asymbiosis 3atomography0 tProtoplasma.g2014 Mar., v. 251, no. 2 p.417-427dSpringer-Verlagx0033-183X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00709-013-0600-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01926naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245011300168300001500281520068200296592002800978650002601006650001301032650001701045650002101062650001301083650004401096650001201140650001401152650001801166650002501184653002101209653002501230653000901255653001301264700001801277700001901295700001401314773011601328856005101444852000901495655001201504IND50075731820221119211846.0140410e20120201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007573182DNAL7 a10.1080/00207233.2012.6193792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHussein, R.M.10aUse of molecular techniques for the analysis of foam-causing bacteria in Al Bireh oxidation ditch, Palestine  ap. 91-101.  aActivated sludge foaming, a worldwide problem, usually consists of filamentous bacteria occurring predominantly in the mixed liquor.

Cell cycle checkpoints are present in each phase of the cell cycle and prevent cell cycle progression when genomic integrity is compromised. The G2 checkpoint is an intricate signaling network that regulates the progression of G2 to mitosis (M). We propose here a node‐based model of G2 checkpoint regulation, in which the action of the central CDK1–cyclin B1 node is determined by the concerted but opposing activities of the Wee1 and cell division control protein 25C (CDC25C) nodes. Phosphorylation of both Wee1 and CDC25C at specific sites determines their subcellular localization, driving them either toward activity within the nucleus or to the cytoplasm and subsequent ubiquitin‐mediated proteasomal degradation. In turn, this subcellular balance of the Wee1 and CDC25C nodes is directed by the action of the PLK1 and CHK1 nodes via what we have termed the ‘nuclear and cytoplasmic decision states’ of Wee1 and CDC25C. The proposed node‐based model provides an intelligible structure of the complex interactions that govern the decision to delay or continue G2/M progression. The model may also aid in predicting the effects of agents that target these G2 checkpoint nodes.  aPublisher supplied data 3acytoplasm 3aeukaryotic cells 3agenomics 3amitosis 3amodels 3aphosphorylation1 avan den Top, Arnout1 aBockaj, Irena1 aBeijnen, Jos H.1 aWürdinger, Thomas1 avan Tellingen, Olaf0 tFEBS Open Bio.g2017 Apr., v. 7, no. 4 p.439-455dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:23386x2211-54637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2211-5463.122063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03687naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245016300167300001600330520203900346592002802385650001302413650001302426650002602439650000902465650001002474650001602484650005002500650001902550650002302569650002502592650001602617650001502633650001102648651001002659653001202669653002602681653001002707653002702717653001202744700001802756700006002774700005702834700005802891700002802949773010802977856008703085852000903172655001203181IND60646252520221119145336.0190913e20190915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064625252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosenv.2019.06.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrasad, P.10aNocturnal, seasonal and intra-annual variability of tropospheric aerosols observed using ground-based and space-borne lidars over a tropical location of India  ap. 185-198.  aThe nocturnal, seasonal and intra-annual variation of vertical distribution of tropospheric aerosols over two nearby stations Gadanki (13.5oN, 79.2oE) and Tirupati (13.6oN, 79.4oE) is investigated using ground-based Micro Pulse Lidar (MPL) and space-borne Lidar (CALIPSO) systems during 2010–2017. The nocturnal variation of aerosol extinction (AE) coefficient reveal high AE below ∼2 km in midnight hours and aerosols are slowly descending towards the surface during early morning hours. From the seasonal variation, AE values are found to be higher at lower altitudes (<2 km) during winter and post-monsoon seasons, a sharp decrease with increasing altitude is found in tandem with boundary layer and low wind speeds. Interestingly, during monsoon season, significant aerosol loading is found in the altitude range of ∼2–5.5 km mainly due to the influence of strong Low Level Jet (LLJ). The clean environment observed below ∼2 km during this season is attributed to the wet scavenging, downward vertical winds and existance of no strong local source. The seasonal mean AE profile derived from CALIPSO matches well with the MPL in all the seasons except in monsoon season where a large bias is noticed below 2 km. The intra-annual variation revealed more than 80% of aerosols existing above (below) the boundary layer during monsoon (winter) months contribute to the total Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD). The depolarization ratio (>0.2) in the month of July shows the dominance of dust particles which includes long-range transport over this locations. Back trajectories reveals that potential sources are changing from season to season at different altitudes and confirms that the aerosols observed at higher altitudes are advected from other land and oceanic regions. Thus, aerosol vertical distribution is mainly controlled by meteorology and dynamics over this region. Further, the reasonably good correlation found between MPL and MODIS AODs suggests that MODIS could provide reliable AOD over land region also.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3aaltitude 3aatmospheric chemistry 3adust 3alidar 3ameteorology 3amoderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer 3amonsoon season 3aseasonal variation 3aspatial distribution 3atroposphere 3awind speed 3awinter 3aIndia 0aAerosol 0aVertical distribution 0aLidar 0aExtinction coefficient 0aCALIPSO1 aRaman, M.Roja1 aRatnam, M.Venkat1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3882-25231 aRavikiran, V.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8773-73361 aMadhavan, B.L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8782-92491 aBhaskara Rao, S.

Here, we present an inventory of the blowfly species associated with the stages of decomposition of pig carcasses in a caatinga area during dry and rainy seasons. The study took place at the Private Reserve for the Environmental Inheritance “Fazenda Almas,” state of Paraíba, Brazil. Using a modified version of the Shannon trap, 32,909 adult specimens belonging to eight species were captured. During the dry season, Cochliomyia macellaria (Fabricius) (52.2%) and Chrysomya albiceps (Wiedemann) (39.9%) were the most abundant species. In the rainy season, when the majority of individuals were captured (93.7%), Chloroprocta idioidea (Robineau-Desvoidy) (71.1%) was the most abundant. Five decomposition stages were recognized, being the active decay the most attractive to colonization by blowflies, except for Lucilia eximia (Wiedemann), which was more abundant in the bloated stage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChrysomya albiceps 3aCochliomyia macellaria 3aLucilia 3aadults 3adry season 3apig carcasses 3awet season 3aBrazil1 aSantos, W E1 aFarias, R C A P1 aCreão-Duarte, A J0 tNeotropical entomology.g2014 Apr., v. 43, no. 2 p.122-126dSpringer-Verlagx1519-566X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13744-013-0195-4  aDNAL 7aarticle02279naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245009700167520099700264592002801261650001301289650001001302650002001312650001701332650001701349650002001366653002001386653002601406653001101432653001201443700002401455700001801479700003701497700001901534700001901553700001801572700002101590700002701611700001801638773009801656856008201754852000901836655001201845IND60737646720221120205859.0220830e20210801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073764672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lfs.2021.1196172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRikhtegar, Reza10aNon-coding RNAs role in intracranial aneurysm: General principles with focus on inflammation  aIntracranial aneurysm (IA) is one of the most challenging vascular lesions in the brain for clinicians. It was reported that 1%–6% of the world's population is affected by IAs. Owing to serious complications arising from these lesions, much attention has been paid to better understand their pathophysiology. Non-coding RNAs including short non-coding RNAs and long non-coding RNAs, have critical roles in modulating physiologic and pathological processes. These RNAs are emerging as new fundamental regulators of gene expression, are related with the progression of IA. Non-coding RNAs act via multiple mechanisms and be involved in vascular development, growth and remodeling. Furthermore, these molecules are involved in the regulation of inflammation, a key process in the formation and rupture of IA. Studying non-coding RNAs can yield a hypothetical mechanism for better understanding IA. The present study aims to focus on the role of these non-coding RNAs in the pathogenesis of IA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaneurysm 3abrain 3agene expression 3ainflammation 3apathogenesis 3apathophysiology 0aNon-coding RNAs 0aIntracranial aneurysm 0aMiRNAs 0aLncRNAs1 aMosimann, Pascal J.1 aRothaupt, Jan1 aMirza-Aghazadeh-Attari, Mohammad1 aHallaj, Shahin1 aYousefi, Mehdi1 aAmiri, Atefeh1 aFarashi, Ebrahim1 aKheyrollahiyan, Atefeh1 aDolati, Sanam0 tLife sciences.g2021 Aug. 01, v. 278 p.119617-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11720x0024-32057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2021.1196173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03441naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245013000157520191500287592002802202650002002230650002302250650001102273650001402284650001202298650002202310650003102332650000902363650002102372650002402393650001602417700002802433700002502461700001902486700002002505700001802525700001502543700002202558700002202580700001902602700002302621700002302644700002202667700001602689700002302705773012302728856007502851852000902926655001202935IND60757836920221120161207.0211125e20211027xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075783692DNAL7 a10.3390/nu131138272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTsaban, Gal 14aThe Effect of Weight-Loss Interventions on Cervical and Chin Subcutaneous Fat Depots; the CENTRAL Randomized Controlled Trial  aAccumulation of cervical and chin subcutaneous adipose tissues (SAT) represent known phenotypes of obesity. We aimed to evaluate the sensitivity of these fat storages to long-term weight-loss directed lifestyle-intervention and to assess their relations to bodily-adiposity, insulin-resistance, and cardiometabolic risk; We randomly assigned 278 participants with abdominal-obesity/dyslipidemia to low-fat or Mediterranean/low-carbohydrate diets +/− physical-activity. All participants underwent an 18 month whole-body magnetic resonance imaging follow-up, from which we assessed cervical and chin SAT-areas; Participants (age = 48 years; 90% men; body-mass-index = 30.9 kg/m²) had an 18-month adherence-rate of 86%. Cervical-SAT and chin-SAT decreased after 6-months (−13.1% and −5.3%, respectively, p < 0.001). After 18-months only cervical-SAT remained decreased compared to baseline (−5%, p < 0.001). Cervical and chin-SAT 18-month changes were associated with changes in weight (r = 0.70, r = 0.66 respectively; <0.001 for both) and visceral-adipose-tissue (VAT; r = 0.35, r = 0.42 respectively; <0.001 for both). After adjustment to VAT, waist-circumference, or weight-changes, chin-SAT 18-month reduction was associated with favorable changes in fasting-glucose (β = 0.10; p = 0.05), HbA1c (β = 0.12; p = 0.03), and homeostasis-model-assessment-of-insulin-resistance (β = 0.12; p = 0.03). Cervical-SAT 18-month reduction was associated with decreased triglycerides (β = 0.16; p = 0.02) and leptin (β = 0.19; p = 0.01) independent of VAT; Cervical and chin-SATs are dynamic fat depots that correspond with weight-loss and are associated with changes in cardiometabolic profile. In long-term, chin-SAT displays a larger rebound compared with cervical-SAT. Chin-SAT accumulation is associated with in insulin-resistance, independent of central obesity.

Bi NPs were fabricated on indium tin oxide (ITO) surfaces from a bismuth trichloride solution using potentiostatic double-pulse techniques. The size and density of electrodeposited Bi NPs were controlled by the pulse parameters. Since the NW diameter is governed by the dimension of the Bi catalyst, the electrodeposition is a reliable method to synthesize nanowires directly on substrates with a desired size and density. We show that the density can be adjusted from individual NWs on several square micrometer to very dense NW networks. The diameter can be controlled between thick nanowires above 100 nm to very thin NW of 7 nm in diameter, which is well below the respective exciton dimension. Hence, especially the thinnest NWs exhibit diameter-dependent photoluminescence energies as a result of quantum confinement effects in the radial dimension.  aPublisher supplied data 3abismuth 3acadmium 3acatalysts 3aindium tin oxide 3ananoparticles 3ananowires 3aphotoluminescence 3asemiconductors1 aLittig, Alexander1 aBehn, Dino1 aMews, Alf0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2013 Dec. 11, v. 135, no. 49 p.18520-18527dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fja408265s3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02434naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245012100163300001800284520105300302592002801355650002201383650003701405650001401442650003001456650001401486650003801500650001501538650001901553650001301572650001801585650001101603650003301614650002401647650002101671650003701692700001901729700002001748700001401768700001401782773010201796856008101898852000901979655001201988IND60575666220221121184503.0170728e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057566622DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-017-0901-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Qiuling12aA novel octahedral MnO/RGO composite prepared by thermal decomposition as a noble-metal free electrocatalyst for ORR  ap. 6656-6669.  aOctahedral MnO/reduced graphene oxide (RGO) composite was synthesized by thermal decomposition method and characterized by XRD, Raman, XPS, TGA/DSC, TEM and SEM. The analysis results show that GO was reduced to RGO, and the octahedral MnO nanoparticles disperse on the RGO sheet by thermal decomposition process. It is important that the as-prepared composite exhibits excellent electrocatalytic performance for oxygen reduction reaction. The onset potential of the octahedral MnO/RGO composite is about 100 and 200 mV positive-shifted compared with that of MnO and RGO, respectively. The current density of O₂ reduction for the MnO/RGO composite is also much higher than that of MnO and RGO, respectively. In addition, the composite shows better stability and tolerance ability toward CH₃OH and CO poisoning than that of commercial Pt-based catalyst. The enhanced electrocatalytic performance of octahedral MnO/RGO may make it available to be an efficient and cheap noble-metal free cathodic catalyst for fuel cells and metal–air batteries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3abatteries 3acarbon monoxide poisoning 3acatalysts 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3afuel cells 3agraphene oxide 3amethanol 3ananoparticles 3aoxygen 3ascanning electron microscopy 3athermal degradation 3athermogravimetry 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aJiang, Meiling1 aZhang, Xiaofeng1 aZhen, Fu,1 aLin, Shen0 tJournal of materials science.g2017 June, v. 52, no. 11 p.6656-6669dSpringer USx0022-24617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-017-0901-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04066naa a2200829 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003600113040001800149100001900167245012000186300001400306520177600320592002802096650001802124650001502142650001902157650001002176650001202186650001502198650001202213650001102225650001202236650003002248650004502278650000902323650003502332650002802367650001502395650001002410650002502420650001802445650001102463650001902474650003202493650001502525650001102540650002902551650002702580650000902607650001602616650003002632650001302662650003602675650002702711650001602738653001302754653000802767653000902775653000902784653001202793653001602805653001702821653000902838653002202847653002402869700001602893700001902909700001902928700001902947700002202966700001702988700001803005700001703023700002003040773007303060856008203133852000903215655001203224IND60099089920221118215741.0161021e20130915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009908992DNAL7 a237513062pmid7 a10.1016/j.gene.2013.05.0642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFourati, Mouna10aAssociation between Leptin gene polymorphisms and plasma leptin level in three consanguineous families with obesity  ap. 75-81.  aLeptin (LEP) gene is one of the most promising candidate genes for obesity. Previous studies have tested the association of polymorphisms in LEP gene with obesity and obesity-related metabolic biomarkers (anthropometric variables, glucose, insulin level, leptin level and lipid profile). However, the results of these studies were still controversial. To determine whether LEP gene is associated with obesity in Tunisian population, we performed a family-based association study between LEP polymorphisms and obesity and obesity-related metabolic biomarkers.Seven single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 5′ region of LEP gene were genotyped in three consanguineous families including 33 individuals. The previously reported LEP SNPs (H1328084, H1328082, rs10487506, H1328081, H1328080, G-2548A and A19G) were evaluated by PCR-RFLP and direct sequencing methods. Single SNP association and haplotype association analyses were performed using the family-based association test (FBAT). To determine allele frequencies of these SNPs in general population, 52 unrelated individuals from the general Tunisian population were also analyzed.Two SNPs showed significant associations with plasma leptin level (H1328084: A>G, Z=2.058, p=0.039; A19G: G>A, Z=2.058, p=0.039). When haplotypes were constructed with these two-markers, the risk AA haplotype (frequency 57.1%) was positively associated with plasma leptin level (Z=2.058, p=0.039). Moreover, SNPs H1328084 and A19G are predicted to modify transcription-factor binding sites.Our study provided that two functional variants in 5′ regulatory region of LEP gene are associated with plasma leptin level as a quantitative trait. It suggested that H1328084 and A19G have an important role in regulating plasma leptin level.  aPublisher supplied data 3abinding sites 3abiomarkers 3agene frequency 3agenes 3aglucose 3ahaplotypes 3ainsulin 3aleptin 3aobesity 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3arisk 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 2a5' Untranslated Regions 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aCase-Control Studies 2aConsanguinity 2aFemale 2aGene Frequency 2aGenetic Association Studies 2aHaplotypes 2aHumans 2aLeptinxbloodxgenetics. 2aLinkage Disequilibrium 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aObesityxbloodxgenetics. 2aPedigree 2aPolymorphism, Single Nucleotide 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aYoung Adult 0aLEP gene 0aSNP 0aFBAT 0aTFBS 0aObesity 0aLeptin gene 0aPolymorphism 0aFBAT 0aAssociation study 0aPlasma leptin level1 aMnif, Mouna1 aKharrat, Najla1 aCharfi, Nédia1 aKammoun, Mahdi1 aFendri, Nourhène1 aSessi, Salwa1 aAbid, Mohamed1 aRebai, Ahmed1 aFakhfakh, Faiza0 tGene.g2013 Sept. 15, v. 527 p.75-81dElsevier B.V.x0378-11197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2013.05.0643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01727naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245006200169520077300231592002801004653000801032653000801040653000801048653000801056653002101064653002401085653001901109653001801128700001501146700002001161700001501181773009801196856008601294852000901380655001201389IND60683539620221119203207.0200330e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068353962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.econlet.2020.1090002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFord, Weixing10aInformation sharing in a contest game with group identity  aIn this paper, we study a private-information contest game with two stages.

While this reaction is highly stereoselective with respect to the amino group, each enzyme can usually catalyse the turnover of a number of different substrates. As the substrate range cannot be inferred from the sequence, it remains an early bottleneck when selecting an enzyme for a biocatalysis application. We have developed a simple first round characterisation method applicable to the broad range of aminotransferases that accept l-glutamate, the central junction of cellular transamination, as one of the amino donors. The assay is based on l-glutamate detection by its highly specific dehydrogenase enzyme in a coupled assay, ending in the reduction of the 2,3-bis-(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide (XTT). While products of most tetrazolium salts are water-insoluble, XTT is reduced to a water soluble colored formazan, allowing direct spectrophotometric detection. The reaction is carried out in microplate format using a single endpoint measurement and is thus suitable for automation. The setup was tested with 7 aminotransferase enzymes: Escherichia coli branched chain amino acid aminotransferase, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae aromatic amino acid AT, Bacillus subtilis histidinol-phosphate AT, and Thermus aquaticus aspartate, serine and histidinol-phosphate AT. In addition to 17 of the 20 proteinogenic amino acids, 32 alternative substrates were tested.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus subtilis 3aEscherichia coli 3aKlebsiella pneumoniae 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aThermus aquaticus 3aaspartic acid 3aautomation 3abiocatalysis 3achemical structure 3aglutamic acid 3asalts 3aserine 3atetrazolium 3atransaminases 3atransamination1 aWard, John M.0 tEnzyme and microbial technology.g2013 Apr. 10, v. 52, no. 4-5 p.218-225dElsevier Inc.x0141-02297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enzmictec.2013.02.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02991naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245014100172520169200313592002802005650001502033650001202048650002002060650001702080650003302097650001702130650001602147650002202163653003902185653001502224653001702239653003902256653001302295700005602308700003202364773011402396856008602510852000902596655001202605IND60734882120221122111556.0211106e20210815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073488212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.1259232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMasoumi, Hadiseh10aSynthesis of polystyrene-based hyper-cross-linked polymers for Cd(II) ions removal from aqueous solutions: Experimental and RSM modeling  aThe hyper-cross-linked polymers (HCPs) based on the polystyrene was synthesized during the Friedel-Craft reaction in various situations. The HCPs synthesis were carried out in various operating conditions including reaction time in the range of 3–23 h, the ratio of cross-linker to monomer in range of 1–5 at temperature of 80 ℃. In addition, the cadmium adsorption process was carried out at a temperature in the range of 25–85 ℃ and initial cadmium concentration in the range of 10–100 mg/L. The response surface methodology (RSM) has been applied for optimizing the process using synthesis and adsorption parameters. The optimized synthesis conditions were obtained 3.32, 11.26 h, 80 ℃, in ratio, synthesis time, and temperature, respectively. Also, the optimized adsorption conditions were obtained 80 mg/L and 35 ℃, initial cadmium ion concentration, and temperature, respectively. The surface area and thermal stability were obtained at 853.89 m²/g and 450 ℃, respectively. The maximum adsorption capacity and removal efficiency had been obtained 950 mg/g and 92% at a temperature of 20 ℃, after 80 min, respectively. The maximum adsorption capacity and removal efficiency were observed in the initial concentration of 120 mg/L and 10 mg/L, respectively. The adsorption process behavior was surveyed using isotherm, kinetic and thermodynamic models. The isotherm results showed that the adsorption of cadmium by HCPs is multi-layer and heterogeneous. The thermodynamic parameters showed that the process is exothermic and spontaneous. Finally, the kinetic results showed that the process occurred physically and slowly as the temperature raised.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acadmium 3aheat production 3apolystyrenes 3aresponse surface methodology 3asurface area 3atemperature 3athermal stability 0aHyper-cross-linked polymers (HCPs) 0aAdsorption 0aCadmium ions 0aResponse surface methodology (RSM) 0aModeling1 aGhaemi, Ahad1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0390-40831 aGannadzadeh Gilani, Hossein0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2021 Aug. 15, v. 416 p.125923-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.1259233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01490naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002300138245023100161300001800392520033100410592002800741650001900769650001400788650002500802650001600827650002700843650002300870650001800893650001400911700002400925773013300949856007301082852000901155655001201164IND60658594320221121200124.0190826e20100309xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065859432DNAL7 a10.1039/b925668g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHanessian, Stephen10aBiomimetic synthesis and structural refinement of the macrocyclic dimer aminoglycoside 66-40C—the remarkably selective self-condensation of a putative aldehyde intermediate in the submerged culture medium producing sisomicin  ap. 2013-2015.  aAminoglycoside 66-40C, an unprecedented 16-membered bis-azadiene macrocyclic natural product isolated from the Micromonospora producer of the antibiotic sisomicin, was synthesized following a biomimetic strategy which definitively established its origin as arising from a remarkably selective non-enzymatic macro-dimerization.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMicromonospora 3aaldehydes 3abiomimetic synthesis 3abiomimetics 3achemical communication 3achemical reactions 3aculture media 3asisomicin1 aMaianti, Juan Pablo0 tChemical communications.g2010 Mar. 9, v. 46, no. 12 p.2013-2015dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b925668g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02338naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100002400135245012000159300001400279520122200293592002801515650002301543650001201566650001601578650001401594650001301608650002001621650001101641650000901652651001401661653002201675653001801697653002201715653001701737700001701754773010001771852000901871856007201880655001201952IND4417651920221123033441.0200510e20090301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441765192DNAL7 a10.1071/MU080252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGatto, Alejandro J.10aProvisioning of mates and chicks by Cayenne and Royal Terns: resource partitioning in northern Patagonia, Argentina  ap. 49-55.  aCayenne (Thalasseus sandvicensis eurygnathus) and Royal Terns (Thalasseus maximus) breed in mixed colonies in Argentina. This paper presents the first detailed information on their breeding diet and assesses differences and overlap between species in the type and size of prey. During 2004 and 2005, observations of prey delivered to mates and chicks were carried out at Punta León, Patagonia. The diet of Cayenne and Royal Terns comprised nine and 10 prey species respectively. Fish comprised >99% of the prey of both species of tern in the two study years. Both species had a fairly specialised diet based on pelagic schooling fish, mostly Argentine Anchovy (Engraulis anchoita) and two species of silversides (Odontesthes spp.). Despite observed overlap in trophic resources, our results showed that Argentine Anchovy was the main prey for Royal Terns, whereas the two species of silversides together with Anchovy comprised the bulk of the diet for Cayenne Terns. Fish delivered by Cayenne Terns were significantly smaller than those by Royal Terns. Results suggested that both type and size of prey may be important factors permitting food partitioning between the two species of tern during the breeding season.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEngraulis anchoita 3aLaridae 3aOdontesthes 3aanchovies 3abreeding 3abreeding season 3achicks 3adiet 3aArgentina 0aArgentine Anchovy 0achick-feeding 0afood-partitioning 0amate-feeding1 aYorio, Pablo0 tEmu.g2009 Mar. 1, v. 109, no. 1 p.49-55dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl3957316x1448-55407nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1071/MU080253Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02658naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001800153245017000171300001600341520144800357592002801805650001501833650001401848650002301862650001301885650001301898650001101911650001101922650000901933650001601942650002401958700001401982700001501996700001202011700001702023700001502040773010902055856008702164852000902251655001202260IND60087690320221118065449.0141102e20130410xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008769032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enzmictec.2013.02.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Xuebing10aKinetics of lipase recovery from the aqueous phase of biodiesel production by macroporous resin adsorption and reuse of the adsorbed lipase for biodiesel preparation  ap. 226-233.  aA commercial macroporous resin (D3520) was screened for lipase recovery by adsorption from the aqueous phase of biodiesel production. The influences of several factors on the adsorption kinetics were investigated. It was found that the kinetic behavior of lipase adsorption by macroporous resin could be well described by pseudo-first-order model. Temperature had no significant effects on lipase adsorption, while resin-to-protein ratio (R) significantly affected both rate constant (k₁) and equilibrium adsorption capacity (Qₑ). No lipase was adsorbed when mixing (shaking) was not performed; however, protein recovery reached 98% after the adsorption was conducted at 200rpm for 5h in a shaker. The presence of methanol and glycerol showed significant negative influence on lipase adsorption kinetics. Particularly, increasing glycerol concentration could dramatically decrease k₁ but not impact Qₑ. Biodiesel was found to dramatically decrease Qₑ even present at a concentration as low as 0.02%, while k₁ was found to increase with biodiesel concentration. The adsorbed lipase showed a relatively stable catalytic activity in tert-butanol system, but poor stability in solvent-free system when used for biodiesel preparation. Oil and biodiesel were also found to adsorb onto resin during transesterification in solvent-free system.

Compared to the control, H2O2, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), ascorbate (ASC), dehydroascorbate (DHA), and glutathione disulfide (GSSG) contents increased, whereas a constant content of glutathione (GSH) and decreases in ASC/DHA and GSH/GSSG ratios were observed in the presence of PEG. The activities of ascorbate peroxidase (APX), dehydroascorbate reductase (DHAR), and glutathione reductase (GR) were upregulated, except for monodehydroascorbate reductase (MDHAR) activity during PEG-induced water deficit. Se application decreased the contents of H2O2, TBARS, DHA, and GSSG, increased the levels of GSH and ASC, and inhibited the decreases of ASC/DHA and GSH/GSSG ratios. Although it did not affect APX activity significantly, Se addition improved the activities of MDHAR, DHAR, and GR. Furthermore, GR activity showed the highest increase followed by that of DHAR and MDHAR in decreasing order. These data indicated that fluctuations in ASC–GSH metabolism resulting from Se may have a positive effect on drought stress mitigation, and the regulation in the ASC–GSH cycle can be attributed mainly to GR and DHAR in PEG + Se-treated T. repens seedlings.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTrifolium repens 3aantioxidant activity 3aascorbate peroxidase 3aglutathione dehydrogenase (ascorbate) 3aglutathione-disulfide reductase 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ametabolism 3amonodehydroascorbate reductase (NADH) 3apolyethylene glycol 3aseedlings 3aselenium 3athiobarbituric acid-reactive substances 3awater stress1 aXu, Heng-Jian1 aLiu, Tao0 tJournal of plant growth regulation.g2011 Dec., v. 30, no. 4 p.436-444dSpringer-Verlagx0721-75957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00344-011-9206-z  aDNAL 7aarticle02629naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100002500180245011600205300002000321506007600341520111700417592002801534506003701562650002201599650001201621650001201633650001401645650001901659650001101678650004401689650002001733650001301753650002001766650003401786700002001820700002401840700002501864700001801889700001501907700001901922773013401941856007502075852000902150655001202159IND60539038120221207124048.0160815e20131211xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053903812DNAL7 a10.1021/ja408550a2doi7 aPMC41171942pmcid7 a242192452pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aClaridge, Shelley

We use a custom-built low-current scanning tunneling microscope to image peptide structures at the single-molecule scale in a model peptide that forms β sheets, a structural motif common in protein misfolding diseases. We successfully differentiate between histidine and alanine amino acid residues, and further differentiate side chain orientations in individual histidine residues, by correlating features in scanning tunneling microscope images with those in energy-optimized models. Beta sheets containing histidine residues are used as a model system due to the role histidine plays in transition metal binding associated with amyloid oligomerization in Alzheimer’s and other diseases. Such measurements are a first step toward analyzing peptide and protein structures at the single-molecule level.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aX-ray diffraction 3aalanine 3aamyloid 3ahistidine 3aimage analysis 3amodels 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aoligomerization 3apeptides 3aprotein folding 3ascanning tunneling microscopy1 aThomas, John C.1 aSilverman, Miles A.1 aSchwartz, Jeffrey

However, the spatial variation of the correlation between solute transport parameters and soil properties are rarely studied. In this study, the spatial correlation among laboratory-measured transport parameters dispersivity and coefficient of distribution of a reactive and a nonreactive solute and soil properties were studied at the scale of a few meters using a dense sampling design. In an area of 84 m² and a depth of 2 m, 55 undisturbed soil samples were taken to determine the soil properties. Column experiments were performed, and the transport parameters were obtained by fitting the experimental data to the analytical solution of the advection-dispersion equation using the computer program CFITM. Stepwise multiple linear regression (MLR) was performed in order to identify the statistically significant variables. The spatial correlation of the variables and between variables were determined using the Stanford Geostatistical Modeling Software. Soil properties presented a moderate coefficient of variation, while hydraulic conductivity and transport parameters were widely dispersed. The difference between its minimum and maximum value was quite large for most of the studied variables evidencing their high variability. Both dispersivity and retardation factor were higher than the expected and this result can be related to the preferential pathways and to the non-connected micropores. None of the physical soil property was strongly correlated to the transport parameters. Coefficient of distribution was strongly correlated to the cation exchange capacity and significantly correlated to mesoporosity and microporosity. Hydraulic conductivity presented significant positive correlation to the effective porosity and macroporosity. Stepwise multiple linear regression analysis indicated that further studies should be performed aiming to include other variables relevant for lateritic soils such as pH, electrical conductivity, the content of Al and Fe, CaCO₃ and soil structure and microstructure. The study of the spatial correlation among transport parameters and soil properties showed that the codispersion among the variables is not constant in space and can be important in dictate the behavior of the combined variables. Our results also showed that some variables that were identified as explanatory in the MLR were not significant in the spatial analysis of the correlation, showing the importance of this kind of analyses for a better decision about the most relevant variables and their relations. The present study was a first attempt to evaluate the spatial variation in the correlation coefficient of transport parameters of a reactive and a nonreactive solute, indicating the more relevant variables and the ones that should be included in future studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3acalcium carbonate 3acation exchange capacity 3acomputer software 3aelectrical conductivity 3aequations 3ageostatistics 3ahydraulic conductivity 3airon 3alaterites 3amicropores 3amicrostructure 3amodels 3apH 3aporosity 3aprediction 3aregression analysis 3asoil sampling 3asolutes 3auncertainty analysis 3awater flow 0aCross-variogram 0aDispersivity 0aRetardation factor 0aColumn experiment 0aUndisturbed soil sample1 aZuquette, Lázaro Valentin1 aGómez-Hernandez, Jaime,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0720-21960 tGeoderma.g2019 Apr. 01, v. 339 p.59-69dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl16374x0016-70617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2018.12.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03665naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002700147245015700174300001400331520225000345592002802595650003402623650002702657650002802684650002802712650002402740650002402764650002602788650000902814650001902823650003102842650001302873650001202886650001402898650001002912650000902922700003002931700002302961700002702984773010503011856008103116961001303197852000903210655001203219IND60083223020221118162300.0141101e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008322302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jip.2011.09.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShapiro-Ilan, David I.10aDirectional movement of entomopathogenic nematodes in response to electrical field: effects of species, magnitude of voltage, and infective juvenile age  ap. 34-40.  aEntomopathogenic nematodes respond to a variety of stimuli when foraging. Previously, we reported a directional response to electrical fields for two entomopathogenic nematode species; specifically, when electrical fields were generated on agar plates Steinernema glaseri (a nematode that utilizes a cruiser-type foraging strategy) moved to a higher electric potential, whereas Steinernema carpocapsae, an ambush-type forager, moved to a lower potential. Thus, we hypothesized that entomopathogenic nematode directional response to electrical fields varies among species, and may be related to foraging strategy. In this study, we tested the hypothesis by comparing directional response among seven additional nematode species: Heterorhabditis bacteriophora, Heterorhabditis georgiana, Heterorhabditis indica, Heterorhabditis megidis, Steinernema feltiae, Steinernema riobrave, and Steinernema siamkayai. S. carpocapsae and S. glaseri were also included as positive controls. Heterorhabditids tend toward cruiser foraging approaches whereas S. siamkayai is an ambusher and S. feltiae and S. riobrave are intermediate. Additionally, we determined the lowest voltage that would elicit a directional response (tested in S. feltiae and S. carpocapsae), and we investigated the impact of nematode age on response to electrical field in S. carpocapsae. In the experiment measuring diversity of response among species, we did not detect any response to electrical fields among the heterorhabditids except for H. georgiana, which moved to a higher electrical potential; S. glaseri and S. riobrave also moved to a higher potential, whereas S. carpocapsae, S. feltiae, and S. siamkayai moved to a lower potential. Overall our hypothesis that foraging strategy can predict directional response was supported (in the nematodes that exhibited a response). The lowest electric potential that elicited a response was 0.1V, which is comparable to electrical potential associated with some insects and plant roots. The level of response to electrical potential diminished with nematode age. These results expand our knowledge of electrical fields as cues that may be used by entomopathogenic nematodes for host-finding or other aspects of navigation in the soil.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHeterorhabditis bacteriophora 3aHeterorhabditis indica 3aHeterorhabditis megidis 3aSteinernema carpocapsae 3aSteinernema feltiae 3aSteinernema glaseri 3aSteinernema riobravis 3aagar 3aelectric field 3aentomopathogenic nematodes 3aforaging 3ainsects 3ajuveniles 3aroots 3asoil1 aLewis, E.

This study aimed to identify major agronomic and physiological traits associated with high grain yields of rice and wheat in the wheatârice rotation system in the lower reaches of Yangtze River of China. Two high-yielding cultivars, each for winter wheat and rice, were field-grown from 2008 to 2010 for 3 years. Two crop management treatments, the local farmer's practice (LFP) and improved high-yielding cultivation (IHC), were used. The IHC adopted two new techniques, i.e., site-specific nitrogen management in both rice and wheat and alternate wetting and moderate drying irrigation in rice and controlled soil drying irrigation in wheat. Across the 3 years, the IHC yielded an average 9.67thaâ»Â¹ of wheat and 12.55thaâ»Â¹ of rice with an annual total of 22.2thaâ»Â¹, an increase of 26.8% when compared with that (17.5thaâ»Â¹) under the LFP. The increased grain yield under the IHC was mainly attributed to expanded sink size as a result of more kernels per spike or more spikelets per panicle, increased kernel weight of wheat and increased percentage of filled grains of rice. When compared with LFP, IHC showed a greater percentage of productive tillers, more pre-anthesis nonstructural carbohydrate (NSC) storage in the stem, greater leaf photosynthetic rate and concentration of cytokinins in root exudates, higher activities of sucrose synthase and adenosine diphosphoglucose pyrophosphorylase in grains, more dry mater production during the grain filling period, and higher harvest index. We conclude that (1) expanding sink capacity through an increase in kernels per spike or spikelets per panicle, (2) enhancing grain filling efficiency by an increase in pre-anthesis NSC in the stem, and (3) increasing post-anthesis dry mater production by an enhancement in root activity during grain filling should be considered as three major strategies for further increases in grain yields of wheat and rice in the lower reaches of Yangtze River of China.  aPublisher supplied data 3afilling period 3ainflorescences 3arice 3amethodology 3ahigh-yielding varieties 3aroots 3asucrose synthase 3airrigation 3acarbohydrates 3agrain yield 3aphotosynthesis 3aleaves 3aseeds 3aharvest index 3awinter wheat 3acrop management 3arice soils 3anitrogen 3aroot exudates 3aagronomic traits 3atillers 3aYangtze River 3aChina 0anew methods1 aLiu, Lijun1 aWang, Zhiqin1 aYang, Jianchnag1 aZhang, Jianhua0 tField crops research.g2012 July 11, v. 133 p.119-129dElsevier B.V.x0378-42907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fcr.2012.04.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02256naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005300148245008300201300002000284520113300304592002801437596005701465596007801522650001101600650001101611650001101622650001401633650001301647651001001660700001301670773015501683856008301838852000901921655001201930IND60780184620221117042637.0220616e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078018462DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-021-18354-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Yao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6867-000610aChanges in carbon emission performance of energy-intensive industries in China  ap. 43913-43927.  aAs the major energy consumers, energy-intensive industries are the key players in achieving carbon emission reduction targets. The paper builds a super slack-based model (SBM) considering this undesirable output and calculates the carbon emission efficiency. Then, the meta-frontier Malmquist–Luenberger productivity index (MF-MLPI) is constructed to dynamically analyze the growth rate changes of the carbon emission efficiency and the regional differences in energy-intensive industries. Furthermore, the carbon emission reduction potential of the energy-intensive industries in various economic regions of China is discussed, and the conclusions are as follows: there is a big difference in the carbon emission technology gap ratios (TGRs) of the energy-intensive industries in different economic regions; the growth rate of the carbon emission efficiency of energy-intensive industries shows a trend of first declining and then slowly recovering, while the carbon reduction potential generally shows a trend of decreasing and then rising; and the carbon emission reduction potential in the eastern region keeps decreasing.  aPublisher supplied data  a19EYB012cJiangsu Provincial Social Science Fund(CN)  a2019SJA0187cJiangsu University Philosophy and Social Science Project(CN) 3acarbon 3aenergy 3amodels 3apollution 3aresearch 3aChina1 aWu, Jing0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2022 June, v. 29, no. 29 p.43913-43927dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-18354-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03181naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245009500170300001600265500001900281520204500300592002802345650001402373650001502387650002202402650002402424650002602448650001202474650001802486650001902504650001702523650001202540650001002552651001902562773013402581856008302715852000902798655001202807IND60701413020221118120617.0200726e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070141302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jneb.2020.04.1922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuelskamp, Amelia10aP145 Results of Using Improvised Kitchen Spaces to Teach Skills-Based Nutrition in Schools  ap.

SCT was integrated into a nutrition curriculum using improvised kitchen space to provide opportunities for observational learning and development of behavioral skills and self-efficacy.This program was designed for high school students living in rural southeastern North Carolina. Teachers at the school were interviewed to identify greatest needs for their students, and a curriculum was planned for the entire 9th grade class.The curriculum was implemented in 4 sessions. Session 1 targeted food groups and nutrients, with practice opportunities to analyze food labels. Students used laptops in session 2 to find recipes for favorite meals, analyze the nutrition content using an online application, and modify recipes to meet nutrition requirements. In session 3, student teams traveled to a supermarket where each team had $10 to purchase ingredients, and session 4 was devoted to preparing and tasting the modified recipes in an improvised kitchen.With IRB approval, the teaching team administered an anonymous follow-up survey to participants (n = 40). Each item (Likert scales) addressed a program objective. Each item began with the stem, “After participating in the nutrition sessions, I feel more confident to:” followed by 12 target behaviors, like “analyze nutrition information for any recipe.”Of 40 participants, 78% reported increased confidence to perform at least 75% of the target behaviors.Integration of SCT in a cooking curriculum could improve self-efficacy to perform cooking related skills. Higher self-efficacy may increase frequency of a behavior (Glanz, Rimer, and Viswanath, p. 163). Improvised kitchen space provides small teams with chances for observational learning, social support, and stress-free opportunities to develop mastery of skills.None.  aPublisher supplied data 3acognition 3acurriculum 3aideal body weight 3anutrition education 3anutrition information 3aobesity 3aself-efficacy 3asocial support 3asupermarkets 3asurveys 3ayouth 3aNorth Carolina0 tJournal of nutrition education and behavior.g2020 July, v. 52, no. 7 p.S84-S85dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl70490x1499-40467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jneb.2020.04.1923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02520naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149100002800167245013100195300001800326520059600344592002800940650002400968650003100992650001001023650001101033650001701044650001201061650008701073650008001160650001601240650004501256650001201301650006201313650000901375650000901384650002501393650002401418650002201442650001701464650006201481650001601543650007101559650007301630650005301703700003201756700002301788773008601811856008401897852000901981655001201990IND4476890420221118070929.0141111e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447689042DNAL7 a218563862pmid7 a10.1016/j.fitote.2011.08.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdão, Camila Rodrigues12aA new steroidal saponin with antiinflammatory and antiulcerogenic properties from the bulbs of Allium ampeloprasum var. porrum  ap. 1175-1180.  aA new steroidal saponin was isolated from the bulbs of Allium ampeloprasum var. porrum L.

Conventionally, capillary electrophoresis fragment analysis on a genetic analyzer is used for the sizing of the CGG repeats of FMR1, but additional Southern blot analysis is required for exact measurement when the repeat number is higher than 200. Here, we present an accurate and robust polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based method for quantification of the CGG repeats of FMR1. The first step of this test is PCR amplification of the repeat sequences in the 5’UTR of the FMR1 promoter using a Fragile X PCR kit, followed by purification of the PCR products and fragment sizing on a microfluidic capillary electrophoresis instrument, and subsequent interpretation of the number of CGG repeats by referencing standards with known repeats using the analysis software. This PCR-based assay is reproducible and capable of identifying the full range of CGG repeats of FMR1 promoters, including those with a repeat number of more than 200 (classified as full mutation), 55 to 200 (premutation), 46 to 54 (intermediate), and 10 to 45 (normal). It is a cost-effective method that facilitates classification of the FXS and Fragile X-associated disorders with robustness and rapid reporting time.  aPublisher supplied data 3a5' untranslated regions 3aSouthern blotting 3acapillary electrophoresis 3acomputer software 3acost effectiveness 3aenzymes 3agenes 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amutation 3apolymerase chain reaction1 aZhu, Xiaofan1 aGui, Baoheng1 aCheung, Wan Chee1 aShi, Mengmeng1 aYang, Zhenjun1 aKwok, Ka Yin1 aLim, Ricky1 aPietilä, Sanna1 aZhu, Yuanfang1 aChoy, Kwong Wai0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2019 Sept. 16, , no. 151 p.e59963-e59963dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/599633Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/59963/a-robust-polymerase-chain-reaction-based-assay-for-quantifying  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02437naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245009700167300001800264520125800282592002801540650002001568650002001588650001901608650001501627650000901642650001801651650002301669650001301692650001401705653002901719653000901748653000701757653000901764700001901773700001701792700001201809773011401821856008301935852000902018655001202027IND60670400220221121203848.0191214e20191202xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067040022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molp.2019.09.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Renshan12aA PIF7-CONSTANS-Centered Molecular Regulatory Network Underlying Shade-Accelerated Flowering  ap. 1587-1597.  aTo compete with their neighbors for light and escape shaded environments, sun-loving plants have developed the shade-avoidance syndrome (SAS), a set of responses including alteration of plant architecture and initiation of early flowering and seed set. Previous studies on SAS mainly focused on dissecting molecular basis of hypocotyl elongation in seedlings under shade light; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying shade-accelerated flowering in adult plants remain unknown. In this study, we found that CONSTANS (CO) and PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTOR 7 (PIF7) have an additive effect on shade-induced flowering, but that LONG HYPOCOTYL IN FAR-RED1 (HFR1) represses early flowering by binding to CO and PIF7 and preventing the binding of CO to the promoter of FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) and the binding of PIF7 to the promoter of pri-MIR156E/F. Under shade, de-phosphorylated PIF7 and accumulated CO, balanced by HFR1, upregulate the expression of FT, TSF, SOC1, and SPLs to accelerate flowering. Moreover, we found that the function of PIF7 in flowering time is independent of phyA. Collectively, these regulatory interactions establish a crucial link between the light signal and genetic network that regulates flowering transition under shade.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadditive effect 3aearly flowering 3aflowering time 3ahypocotyls 3aloci 3amature plants 3aplant architecture 3aseed set 3aseedlings 0ashade avoidance response 0aPIF7 0aCO 0aHFR11 aYang, Chuanwei1 aJiang, Yupei1 aLi, Lin0 tMolecular plant.g2019 Dec. 02, v. 12, no. 12 p.1587-1597dElsevier Inc.wJournal:J000001387x1674-20527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molp.2019.09.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02128naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245009400163300002000257520089100277592002801168650001601196650002401212650001201236650002001248650001001268650001301278650001601291700002601307700001701333700002401350700002001374700002301394700001901417700002801436700001701464700001901481773013401500856007501634852000901709655001201718IND60539038520170628000000.0160815e20131211xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053903852DNAL7 a10.1021/ja408815k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSājid, Muḥammad,10aCarbonylation Reactions of Intramolecular Vicinal Frustrated Phosphane/Borane Lewis Pairs  ap. 18567-18574.  aThe intramolecular frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) Mes₂PCH₂CH₂B(C₆F₅)₂ 4 adds cooperatively to carbon monoxide to form the five-membered heterocyclic carbonyl compound 5. The intramolecular FLP 7 contains an exo-3-B(C₆F₅)₂ Lewis acid and an endo-2-PMes₂ Lewis base functionality coordinated at the norbornane framework. This noninteracting FLP adds carbon monoxide in solution at −35 °C cooperatively to yield a five-membered heterocyclic FLP-carbonyl compound 8. In contrast, FLP 7 is carbonylated in a CO-doped argon matrix at 25 K to selectively form a borane carbonyl 9 without involvement of the adjacent phosphanyl moiety. The free FLP 7 was generated in the gas phase from its FLPH₂ product 10. A DFT study has shown that the phosphonium hydrido borate zwitterion 10 is formed exergonically in solution but tends to lose H₂ when brought into the gas phase.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLewis acids 3aargon (noble gases) 3aborates 3acarbon monoxide 3agases 3ahydrogen 3azwitterions1 aLawzer, Arunlibertsen1 aDong, Weishi1 aRosorius, Christoph1 aSander, Wolfram1 aSchirmer, Birgitta1 aGrimme, Stefan1 aDaniliuc, Constantin G.1 aKehr, Gerald1 aErker, Gerhard0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2013 Dec. 11, v. 135, no. 49 p.18567-18574dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fja408815k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02688naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145242052600166245012200692300001600814520115600830592002801986650001302014650001702027650002002044650003502064650001602099700003002115700002302145773011502168852000902283856008202292655001202374IND4432786620221118070901.0180619e201003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443278662DNAL7 a10.1007/s10040-009-0506-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMassone, Héctor10aDétermination améliorée de la vulnérabilité de l’eau souterraine dans des domaines géologiques homogènes: une étude de cas des Pampas d’Argentine Evaluación optimizada de la vulnerabilidad de aguas subterráneas en área geológicas homogénes: un caso de estudio de las Pampas de Argentina 均质地区增强型地下水脆弱性评价: 以阿根廷Pampas地区为例 Melhoria da avaliação da vulnerabilidade da água subterrânea em áreas geológicas homogéneas: um estudo de caso nas Pampas Argentinas10aEnhanced groundwater vulnerability assessment in geological homogeneous areas: a case study from the Argentine Pampas  ap. 371-379.  aThe southeast area of the Argentine Pampas is characterized by the presence of an unconfined aquifer in a wide plain. A methodology is proposed that deals with the aquifer vulnerability where the homogeneity of the hydrogeological variables used by traditional methods (in this case, DRASTIC-P) causes vulnerability maps to show more than 80% of the territory under the same class. This absence of discrimination renders vulnerability maps of little use to decision-makers. In addition, the proposed methodology avoids the traditional vague classification (high, low, and moderate vulnerability) which is highly dependent on subjectivity in its association of each class with hydrogeological considerations. That traditional vulnerability assessment methodology was adapted using a geographic information system to reclassify classes, based on the Natural Breaks (Jenks) method. The pixel-to-pixel comparison between the result obtained by the DRASTIC-P and the reclassified classes generates the so-called operational vulnerability index (OVI), which shows four classes, associating each with different hydrogeological requirements to make decisions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3acase studies 3adecision making 3ageographic information systems 3agroundwater1 aQuiroz Londoño, Mauricio1 aMartínez, Daniel,0 tHydrogeology journal.g2010 Mar., v. 18, no. 2 p.371-379dSpringer-VerlagwJournal:jnl3943547x1431-21747nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10040-009-0506-33Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02886naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001300145245012100158300001200279520168500291592002801976650001302004650002202017650002602039650003002065650004002095650001702135650001602152650001402168650002202182650001302204651001002217700001502227700001302242700001802255700001802273773010902291856007902400852000902479655001202488IND60749272920221120000500.0210901e201012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074927292DNAL7 a10.1186/1743-422X-7-1782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXie, Yan10aCharacterization of alphasatellites associated with monopartite begomovirus/betasatellite complexes in Yunnan, China  ap. 178.  aBACKGROUND: Alphasatellites are single-stranded molecules that are associated with monopartite begomovirus/betasatellite complexes. RESULTS: Alphasatellites were identified in begomovirus-infected plant samples in Yunnan, China. All samples that contained alphasatellites also contained betasatellites, but only some samples that contained betasatellites contained alphasatellites. Thirty-three alphasatellites were sequenced, and they ranged from 1360 to 1376 nucleotides. All alphasatellites contain 3 conserved features: a single open reading frame (Rep), a conserved hairpin structure, and an adenine-rich (A-rich) region. On the basis of the phylogenetic tree of the complete nucleotide sequences, the alphasatellites were divided into 3 types with one exception. Type 1 was associated with Tomato yellow leaf curl China virus (TYLCCNV)/Tomato yellow leaf curl China betasatellite (TYLCCNB) complex. Type 2 was associated with Tobacco curly shoot virus (TbCSV)/Tobacco curly shoot betasatellite (TbCSB) complex. Type 3 was associated with TbCSV/Ageratum yellow vein betasatellite (AYVB) complex. Within each type, nucleotide sequence identity ranged from 83.4 to 99.7%, while 63.4-81.3% identity was found between types. Mixed infections of alphasatellites associated with begomovirus/betasatellite complexes were documented. CONCLUSIONS: Our results validate that alphasatellites are only associated with begomovirus/betasatellite complexes. Thirty-three sequenced alphasatellites isolated from Yunnan Province, China were divided into 3 types--each associated with a specific begomovirus/betasatellite complex. Mix-infections of alphasatellite molecules may not be unusual.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgeratum 3aAlphasatellitidae 3aBetasatellite (genus) 3aTobacco curly shoot virus 3aTomato yellow leaf curl China virus 3aleaf curling 3anucleotides 3aphylogeny 3asequence analysis 3avirology 3aChina1 aWu, Peijun1 aLiu, Pei1 aGong, Huanran1 aZhou, Xueping0 tVirology journal.g2010 Dec., v. 7, no. 1 p.178-178dBioMed CentralwJournal:J000001738x1743-422X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1743-422X-7-1783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03186naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002000092024003300112040001800145100002000163245010700183300001600290500000900306520169800315592002802013650001802041650002702059650002502086650002102111650002802132650002602160650002002186650002102206650001902227650001802246650001602264650001202280650001902292650002502311650001102336700001802347700001702365773012102382852000902503856011102512856008002623961001302703655001202716IND4371427620221116151037.0191226e200505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437142762DNAL7 a10113/36902hdl7 a10.2134/agronj2004.00492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMehaffey, M.

We examined the photosynthesis and nutritive value of first (first leaves) and third (third leaves) fully expanded leaves (numbered from the apex) in three warm-season (C4) grasses. Net photosynthetic rates at uniform temperature and light both before and after a 2-wk exposure to full sunlight and the effect of leaf position on nutritive value were determined on vegetative tillers in well-established swards of bermudagrass [Cynodon dactylon L. (Per.) cv. Tifton 44], caucasian bluestem [Bothriochloa caucasica (Trin.) C.E. Hubb.], and Atlantic coastal panicgrass [Panicum amarum var. amarulum (Hitchcock and Chase) P.G. Palmer] growing on a Cecil clay loam (clayey, kaolinitic, thermic Typic Hapludults). Bermudagrass had the greatest level of crude protein (CP), followed by panicgrass and bluestem. Fiber was greater in the first leaves than in the third leaves for bermudagrass and panicgrass but not for bluestem. Photosynthetic rates of panicgrass and bluestem third leaves estimated 2 wk after defoliation of the surrounding canopy were less than estimates made before defoliation in the first leaves but were similar to the third leaves before canopy defoliation. The third leaves of bermudagrass 2 wk after defoliation had lesser photosynthetic rates per unit chlorophyll than the first or third leaves before defoliation. Photosynthetic rates were correlated with hemicellulose across leaf classes and species (r ² = 0.93). The photosynthetic decline observed in third leaves of bermudagrass compared with panicgrass and bluestem is evidence of variation in leaf response after defoliation among warm-season grasses.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahemicellulose 3ain vitro digestibility 3aacid detergent fiber 3aCynodon dactylon 3aneutral detergent fiber 3anet assimilation rate 3anutritive value 3acell respiration 3aforage grasses 3acrude protein 3adefoliation 3aPanicum 3aphotosynthesis 3aBothriochloa bladhii 3aleaves1 aFisher, D.

However, studies so far have focused on cavitation characteristics inside the nozzle. Its influence on the flow during control valve opening remains still unclear. In the paper, a computational study focused on the flow and cavitation phenomena within control valve has been reported and the effects of control valve’s structure parameters (including rounded edge, seal cone angle and outflowing control-orifice structure) on the flow and cavitation characteristics have been investigated in detail.Firstly the 3D model has been validated in terms of single injection quantity and fuel injection duration, showing a good consistency. And then, the development from sheet cavitation to cloud cavitation and the relationship between cavitation, pressure and velocity has been discussed. Based on the numerical results obtained, it is shown that not only the variation of pressure but also the velocity is the important factor which affects cavitation. The increase of the flow velocity reduces the pressure within the flow field which can aggravate the development of cavitation. As cavitation region increases, the fuel flow is hindered and the flow velocity decreases. However, the decrease of flow velocity has suppressed the development of cavitation. All of those variations form a cyclical process.  aPublisher supplied data 3adiesel engines 3afuels 3amodels 0aThe effect of structure parameters 0aThe flow and cavitation characteristics 0aControl valve 0aNumerical simulation1 aLi, Guo-Xiu1 aSun, Zuo-Yu1 aWang, Lan1 aSun, Shu-Ping1 aGu, Jiao-Jiao1 aWu, Xiao-Jun0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2016 Sept. 15, v. 124 p.104-115dElsevier Ltdx0196-89047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2016.07.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03279naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245011900168520151700287592002801804650001901832650001601851650002001867650001701887650001701904650002201921650001201943650001901955650001101974650003101985650002302016650001902039650002902058650002102087650002002108650001202128650001102140650001802151650002302169650001602192651001702208653002702225653001902252653002402271653002502295653002402320653001902344700001802363700001802381700001702399700001802416700001502434700001502449773011802464856008602582852000902668655001202677IND60687354720221120101431.0210201e20200615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068735472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2020.1104432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Zhikun10aAssessment of regional greenhouse gas emission from beef cattle production: A case study of Saskatchewan in Canada  aThe beef cattle production has been considered as one of the largest sources of greenhouse gases (GHGs) emission. A large amount of GHGs including N₂O and CH₄ from enteric fermentation and manure are discharged to atmosphere during beef-production process. In addition, a substantial amount of GHGs is also emitted from many other related processes such as feed production, transportation, and energy consumption. In this study, an emission assessment model was developed to quantify the amount of regional GHGs produced from the beef cattle production process. A case study was conducted based on the beef production in Saskatchewan, Canada. The results demonstrated that the GHG emissions from the annual marketed beef cattle in Saskatchewan in 2014 were 8.52 × 10⁹ kg CO₂-eq in total and the cattle-source GHGs (enteric CH₄, manure CH₄, and manure N₂O emission) accounted for more than 90% of the total emission. Sensitivity analysis showed that the most critical factors influencing the GHG emission included feedlot manure handling system, cattle diet, feed additives, maximum methane producing capacity (Bₒ), and climate (temperature, precipitation, and potential evapotranspiration). The potential impacts of climate change on GHG emission from beef cattle production in Saskatchewan were also investigated. An overall decrease in the GHG emission can be observed due to the climate change, which are 3.67%, 4.96%, and 6.63% for 2020–2039, 2040–2059, and 2060–2099, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal manures 3abeef cattle 3abeef production 3acase studies 3acattle feeds 3acattle production 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aenergy 3aenergy use and consumption 3aevapotranspiration 3afeed additives 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agreenhouse gases 3amanure handling 3amethane 3amodels 3anitrous oxide 3arumen fermentation 3atemperature 3aSaskatchewan 0aBeef cattle production 0aGreenhouse gas 0aEmission assessment 0aSensitivity analysis 0aMitigation measures 0aClimate change1 aAn, Chunjiang1 aFang, Hanxiao1 aZhang, Yunlu1 aZhou, Zhigang1 aZhou, Yang1 aZhao, Shan0 tJournal of environmental management.g2020 June 15, v. 264 p.110443-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2020.1104433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02806naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002500146245010800171520150500279592002801784650001601812650001301828650002701841650001201868650001801880650001601898650001101914650002401925650002101949650001201970650001001982650002401992650001402016650000902030650001702039650001102056650001402067650000902081650001802090651001102108700001802119773012202137856008002259852000902339655001202348IND60682777020221119172155.0200131e20191216xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068277702DNAL7 a10.3390/resources80401832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNabukalu, Catherine 10aCharcoal as an Energy Resource: Global Trade, Production and Socioeconomic Practices Observed in Uganda  aAround the world, charcoal has persisted as an energy resource and retained unequivocal dominance in the energy consumption mix of some nations many years on since modern alternatives were invented. Furthermore, it has secured unyielding significance as a commodity on local and international markets and remained an aggressive competitor to electricity and gas for cooking. Here, we analyze the charcoal supply chain and highlight the rudimentary production techniques common within the sub-Saharan region, using Uganda as an example. Top global producers, importers, and exporters are discussed and, based on fieldwork from ten locations in Uganda, we describe common trade practices, economic contributions and the realities of charcoal consumption in areas with concentrated grid and electricity coverage. Indeed, forest degradation and deforestation in the charcoal trade is indiscriminate and the world’s top producers and exporters of charcoal do not necessarily have vast forest resources. Pyrolysis, the process used to produce charcoal from wood, exacerbates risks of wild fires and deteriorates air quality. Our fieldwork indicates that little to no innovation exists to manage waste materials such as ash and polluting gases along the supply chain. Recommendations for the future include better forest conservation practices and more innovation at the cooking level, because effects of localized environmental degradation inevitably lead to negative impacts beyond geographical borders.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair quality 3acharcoal 3aconservation practices 3acooking 3adeforestation 3aelectricity 3aenergy 3aforest conservation 3aforest resources 3aforests 3agases 3ainternational trade 3apyrolysis 3arisk 3asupply chain 3awastes 3awildfires 3awood 3aworld markets 3aUganda1 aGieré, Reto 0 tResources.g2019 Dec. 16, v. 8, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21558x2079-92767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/resources80401833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02712naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245007500168520148100243592002801724650001301752650002901765650001601794650001101810650000901821650002801830650001001858653002501868653002801893653001801921700001601939700001701955700001601972700001701988700001802005700001902023700001502042700001402057700001502071773009602086856008702182852000902269655001202278IND60727946120221120084801.0220606e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072794612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodcont.2021.1079712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Zhiting10aBreed identification of meat using machine learning and breed tag SNPs  aNumerous influential animal breeds and plant varieties provide high-quality and nutritious foods for human.

To improve the accuracy of breed identification, six machine learning methods were evaluated using different number of breed tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and different size of training sets from 13 pig breeds. Herein, six machine learning methods were Naïve Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbor, Random Forest (RF), Artificial Neural Networks and Decision Tree. Results showed that using breed tag SNPs increased identification accuracy compared with random SNPs. For SVM, accuracy of using 20 breed tag SNPs and 200 random SNPs were 99.30 (±0.14%) and 99.13 (±0.11%), respectively. Among the six methods, both RF and SVM methods were robust across all tested scenarios. Additionally, the accuracy of breed identification first increased with the size of training set and then remained stable in Test-in-training breeds test set. Overall, it can be deduced that breed tag SNPs, machine learning methods and training set size play important roles in ensuring the accuracy of breed identification.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaccuracy 3adecision support systems 3afood safety 3ahumans 3ameat 3asupport vector machines 3aswine 0aBreed identification 0aMachine learning method 0aBreed tag SNP1 aDiao, Shuqi1 aTeng, Jinyan1 aChen, Zitao1 aFeng, Xueyan1 aCai, Xiaotian1 aYuan, Xiaolong1 aZhang, Hao1 aLi, Jiaqi1 aZhang, Zhe0 tFood control.g2021 July, v. 125 p.107971-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl56242x0956-71357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2021.1079713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02192naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005200152245012500204500001400329520095500343592002801298650001301326650001701339650002001356650003801376650001201414650001901426650001501445653001401460653001201474653001101486700001801497700001801515700005801533700001901591773010001610856008701710852000901797655001201806IND60710793920221121054312.0210212e20210215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071079392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2020.1280392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Zhou1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6128-142X12aA nanozyme-linked immunosorbent assay based on metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) for sensitive detection of aflatoxin B1  aNAL-light  aIn order to avoid the occurrence of false positives and false negatives caused by conventional enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), we established a novel indirect competitive MOF-linked immunosorbent assay (MOFLISA) method for the high throughput and high sensitive detection of aflatoxin B₁. This method replaces the natural enzyme with functional MOFs to catalyze a chromogenic system. As a result, the limit of detection (LOD) of the MOFLISA method was 0.009 ng·mL⁻¹ with a linear working range from 0.01 to 20 ng·mL⁻¹. The developed MOFLISA method for AFB₁ has a 20-fold improved LOD value compared with the conventional ELISA. The recoveries and relative standard deviations (RSD) ranged from 86.41 to 99.74% and 2.38–9.04%, respectively. The results demonstrate that the recovery rate and accuracy of this detection method is better than that of conventional ELISA, reducing risks offalsepositive andfalsenegativeresults.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaccuracy 3aaflatoxin B1 3adetection limit 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aenzymes 3afood chemistry 3aoccurrence 0aNanozymes 0aMOFLISA 0aMIL-881 aLong, Ling-li1 aChen, Yan-qiu1 aChen, Mao-Long1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3818-49551 aCheng, Yun-Hui0 tFood chemistry.g2021 Feb. 15, v. 338 p.128039-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2020.1280393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02642naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245008200170500001900252520134200271592002801613650001501641650001601656650001701672650001701689650001501706650003401721650003101755650001501786650001301801650002401814650001401838650001801852650002501870653001901895653001301914653002001927700001401947700001501961700001801976773010601994856008702100852000902187655001202196IND60731478120221120033620.0210423e20210605xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073147812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2021.1264632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Xiaoxiao10aCapacitive deionization and methyl orange removal of holey graphene hydrogels  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn this study, we designed a new strategy to synthesize holey graphene hydrogel (r-HGH) using a one-step hydrothermal method by simultaneous reduction and etching. Based on this simple method, the holies on the graphene layers successfully inhibit the collapse of the graphene structure after the drying. Therefore, the r-HGH can form three-dimensional network structure with hierarchical holey. Using as a binderless supercapacitor electrode, the r-HGH exhibits a high specific capacitance of 451 F g⁻¹ and low internal resistance of ~1.6 Ω. The capacitance can maintain 95.6% after 2000 cycles. Applying for capacitive deionization (CDI) for desalination and methyl orange removal, the r-HGH displays a desalination capacity as high as 44.44 mg·g⁻¹ at voltage of 1.2 V with the initial NaCl conductivity of 1600 μS·cm⁻¹, with the short adsorption/desorption equilibrium time of 200 s. Further, the r-HGH has obvious advantages for the electrosorption of charged organic ions. The electrosorption capacity for methyl orange is 57 mg·g⁻¹, and the adsorption/desorption equilibrium time are within 200 s and 100 s, respectively. Thus, the high electrosorption capacity and rate for NaCl and methyl orang enables the r-HGH to be a promising electrode material for capacitive deionization and wastewater treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acapacitance 3adeionization 3adesalination 3adesorption 3aelectric potential difference 3aelectrochemical capacitors 3aelectrodes 3agraphene 3ahot water treatment 3ahydrogels 3amethyl orange 3awastewater treatment 0aHoley graphene 0aHydrogel 0aElectrosorption1 aLiu, Ling1 aZhang, Jie1 aMeng, Qinghan0 tColloids and surfaces.g2021 June 05, v. 618 p.126463-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2021.1264633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03144naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245014700164520154900311592002801860650002201888650001801910650001601928650001201944650002001956650002001976650002301996650002202019650003002041650001102071650001702082650002202099650003302121650001002154650002802164651001002192653003502202653001802237653003302255653001902288653002202307700001702329700001402346700002102360700001302381700001902394773011802413856008602531852000902617655001202626IND60687355320221120101426.0210201e20200615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068735532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2020.1104512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWen, Xin10aDoes the prohibition on open burning of straw mitigate air pollution? An empirical study in Jilin Province of China in the post-harvest season  aStraw open burning is common practice in agricultural production, and has been identified as highly relevant to regional haze. A variety of control measures for straw open burning have been adopted in agricultural areas to mitigate air pollution, but their contribution to air quality improvement is difficult to estimate, and has been addressed by few studies. Using Jilin Province during the post-harvest season (PHS) as a study area, we empirically evaluated the contribution of the Straw Open Burning Prohibition Plan (SOBP) to air quality improvement by response surface methodology (RMS) modeling combined with scenario analysis, and constructed and introduced a stagnant index to the RMS model. The results indicated that the adoption of the SOBP by Jilin Province in the 2018 PHS mitigated air pollution effectively. The contribution of the plan to air quality improvement was also evaluated under two scenarios: if the SOBP had been implemented during the 2015 PHS, 2016 PHS, and 2017 PHS, the cumulative PM₂.₅ concentration would have declined in these years by 23%, 15%, and 22%, respectively, compared with their actual values; if the SOBP had not been implemented in the 2018 PHS, the cumulative PM₂.₅ concentration would have increased by 10%–14% compared with the actual value. The results can provide decision makers with a reference to assess the environmental performance of the SOBP, and guidance for establishing scientific environmental regulations for cleaner agricultural production and sustainable development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3aair pollution 3aair quality 3aburning 3acontrol methods 3adecision making 3aempirical research 3aenvironmental law 3aenvironmental performance 3amodels 3aparticulates 3apollution control 3aresponse surface methodology 3astraw 3asustainable development 3aChina 0aStraw open burning prohibition 0aAir pollution 0aResponse surface methodology 0aStagnant index 0aScenario analysis1 aChen, Weiwei1 aChen, Bin1 aYang, Chengjiang1 aTu, Gang1 aCheng, Tianhai0 tJournal of environmental management.g2020 June 15, v. 264 p.110451-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2020.1104513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02237naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006700139245014300206300001600349500002000365520075800385592002801143596004201171596002801213596006401241596011001305650002601415650001501441650001101456650001001467650000901477650000901486650001601495651001301511651001101524700002501535700002401560700002601584773012201610856007401732852000901806655001201815IND60787067220221118153837.0220807e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078706722DNAL7 a10.1111/jfb.143992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Oliveira, Renildo R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6611-083312aA new species of the Neotropical loricariid Hypostomus cochliodon group (Hypostominae) from the lower Rio Tapajós basin, Brazilian Amazon  ap. 490-498.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aA new species of Hypostomus with spoon‐shaped teeth is described from the Rio Cupari basin, a right margin affluent of the lower Rio Tapajós, Pará State, Brazil.

Location Global. Methods We surveyed ecological and evolutionary concepts related to how a changing climate might alter population persistence. We organized established concepts into a two‐stage framework that relates abiotic change to population persistence via changes in the rates or outcomes of ecological and evolutionary processes. We surveyed reviews of climate change responses, and evaluated patterns in light of our conceptual framework. Results We classified hypotheses for population responses to climate change as one of two types: (1) hypotheses that relate rates of ecological and evolutionary processes (plasticity, dispersal, population growth and evolution) to abiotic change, and (2) hypotheses that relate changes in these processes to four fundamental population‐level responses (colonization, acclimatization, adaptation or extinction). We found that a disproportionate emphasis on response in the climate change literature is difficult to reconcile with ecological and evolutionary theories that emphasize processes. We discuss a set of 24 hypotheses that represent gaps in the literature that limit our ability determine whether observed climate change responses are sufficient to facilitate persistence through future climate change. Main conclusions Though theory relates environmental change to fundamental ecological and evolutionary processes and population‐level responses, clear hypotheses based on theory have not been systematically formulated and tested in the context of climate change. Stronger links between basic theory and observed impacts of climate change are required to assess which responses are common, likely or able to facilitate population persistence despite ongoing environmental change. We anticipate that a hypothesis‐testing framework will reveal that indirect effects of climate change responses are more pervasive than previously thought and related to a few general processes, even though the patterns they create are incredibly diverse.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacclimation 3aclimate change 3aextinction 3apopulation growth 3acolonizing ability 0aadaptation1 aSelig, Elizabeth R.1 aPinsky, Malin L.1 aAltermatt, Florian0 tGlobal ecology and biogeography.g2012 July, v. 21, no. 7 p.693-703dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1466-822X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1466-8238.2011.00713.x  aDNAL 7aarticle03645naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129040001800151100002800169245013800197300001400335500001500349506007600364520220400440592002802644506003702672650001902709650002502728650001702753650001402770650001502784650002402799650001302823650002202836650001702858650002202875650001802897650001702915650002002932650001002952651001302962653001602975773010602991856008103097852000903178655001203187IND50058822320221207051959.0160522e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5005882232DNAL7 a10.1007/s13659-012-0004-52doi7 aPMC41315672pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMhiko, Tinotenda Admire10aDetermination of the causes and the effects of storage conditions on the quality of silo stored wheat (Triticum aestivum) in Zimbabwe  ap. 21-28.  a2019-12-05  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThere are still cases of millers returning poor quality red wheat to the Zimbabwe Grain Marketing Board (GMB) and this has been an ongoing problem over the past few years. A larger amount of this wheat has discoloured and damaged embryos and it is discounted by millers because the germs are brittle and they crumble easily. There have been also many rejections of the red wheat particularly by major traders. Therefore there was an urgent need to investigate the causes and effects of storage conditions on the quality of silo-stored red wheat, since red wheat is one of human beings’ main food supplies. A representative sample of 2.25 kg of red winter wheat was randomly collected from the common red winter wheat incoming to the Grain Marketing Board Depot for storage. This representative sample of 2.25 kg was used as the control sample and its test density was determined. The control sample was then finely ground and analysed for protein, moisture, ash, aflatoxins and falling number. The red winter wheat was then stored in six different silos for a period of 5 months, with each silo having different humidity and temperature conditions. Representative samples of 4.5 kg were randomly collected monthly from each silo during the storage period. The test densities of the representative samples were determined. These representative samples were then finely ground and analysed for protein, moisture, ash, aflatoxins, and falling number. The results of the red wheat in storage were then compared with those of the control sample and analysed by analysis of variance (ANOVA) at the 5% level of significance. Results obtained after data analysis suggest that there were significant differences in the protein content, moisture content and falling number of the wheat before and after storage. However, differences in test density, aflatoxin and ash contents of the wheat before and after storage were not statistically significant at the 5% level of significance. The deterioration in wheat quality was attributed to the high storage temperature and humidity conditions.

The moment ratio and L-moment ratio diagram methods are also proposed as alternative methods for the choice of the pdfs. These two methods have the advantage of allowing an easy comparison of the fit of several pdfs for several time series (stations) on a single diagram. Plotting the position of a given wind speed data set in these diagrams is instantaneous and provides more information than a goodness-of-fit criterion since it provides knowledge about such characteristics as the skewness and kurtosis of the station data set. In this paper, it is proposed to study the applicability of these two methods for the selection of pdfs for wind speed data. Both types of diagrams are used to assess the fit of the pdfs for wind speed series in the United Arab Emirates. The analysis of the moment ratio diagrams reveals that the Kappa, Log-Pearson type III and Generalized Gamma are the distributions that fit best all wind speed series. The Weibull represents the best distribution among those with only one shape parameter. Results obtained with the diagrams are compared with those obtained with goodness-of-fit statistics and a good agreement is observed especially in the case of the L-moment ratio diagram. It is concluded that these diagrams can represent a simple and efficient approach to be used as complementary method to goodness-of-fit criteria.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWeibull statistics 3acase studies 3adata collection 3atime series analysis 3awind power 3awind speed 3aUnited Arab Emirates 0aWind speed 0aProbability density distribution 0aMoment ratio diagram 0aL-moments 0aGoodness-of-fit criteria 0aAdequacy statistics1 aCharron, C.1 aChebana, F.0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2016 Sept. 15, v. 124 p.247-265dElsevier Ltdx0196-89047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2016.07.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02678naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002600146245012200172520150500294592002801799650002101827650001101848650001101859650001301870650001701883650001601900650001601916650001601932650001601948651001201964651002101976651001201997651001202009651001102021651002002032700001602052773012302068856008002191852000902271655001202280IND60682777620221119172105.0200131e20190929xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068277762DNAL7 a10.3390/resources80401632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmir Jabbari, Amirali10aAlterations in Canadian Hydropower Production Potential Due to Continuation of Historical Trends in Climate Variables  aThe vitality, timing, and magnitude of hydropower production is driven by streamflow, which is determined by climate variables, in particular precipitation and temperature. Accordingly, changes in climate characteristics can cause alterations in hydropower production potential. This delineates a critical energy security concern, especially in places such as Canada, where recent changes in climate are substantial and hydropower production is important for both domestic use and exportation. Current Canadian assessments, however, are limited as they mainly focus on a small number of power plants across the country. In addition, they implement scenario-led top-down impact assessments that are subject to large uncertainties in climate, hydrological, and energy models. To avoid these limitations, we propose a bottom-up impact assessment based on the historical information on climatic trends and causal links between climate variables and hydropower production across political jurisdictions. Using this framework, we estimate expected monthly gain/loss in regional hydropower production potential under the continuation of historical climate trends. Our findings show that Canada’s production potential is expected to increase, although the net gain/loss is subject to significant variations across different regions. Our results suggest increasing potential in Yukon, Ontario, and Quebec but decreasing production in the North Western Territories and Nunavut, British Columbia, and Alberta.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimatic factors 3aenergy 3amodels 3apolitics 3apower plants 3astream flow 3atemperature 3auncertainty 3awater power 3aAlberta 3aBritish Columbia 3aNunavut 3aOntario 3aQuebec 3aYukon Territory1 aNazemi, Ali0 tResources.g2019 Sept. 29, v. 8, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21558x2079-92767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/resources80401633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03592naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005800139245014500197300001600342500001900358500002000377520203500397592002802432650001202460650002202472650002202494650001902516650001702535650000902552650002702561650001302588650001102601650001202612651001002624700001902634700001802653700001802671700002102689700002302710700001802733700001902751700006102770700005702831773014002888856007303028852000903101655001203110IND60698440520221119113825.0200612e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069844052DNAL7 a10.1111/jbg.124782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBordin, Fulvio1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2762-986410aGenetic variability following selection for scrapie resistance in six autochthonous sheep breeds in the province of Bolzano (northern Italy)  ap. 395-406.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aScrapie is an ovine transmissible spongiform encephalopathy, and its susceptibility is associated with polymorphisms in the prion protein gene (PRNP). Genetic selection is currently the most effective mean for eradication of the susceptible VRQ allele in favour of resistant ARR allele. Maintenance of genetic diversity should be one of the major objectives in breeding programmes, especially in endangered breeds, and genetic information are an excellent alternative to pedigree data where these information are missing. The aim of our study was to determine changes of genetic variability in six native sheep breeds from autonomous province of Bolzano, northern Italy, following simulation of scrapie selection scenarios. A total of 684 rams were investigated for PRNP polymorphisms and for 10 microsatellite loci to estimate genetic variability. Across all loci, a total of 163 alleles were detected with a mean of 10.4 alleles per locus. Average observed (Ho) and unbiased expected (uHe) heterozygosity overall loci were 0.74 and 0.78, respectively, showing a statistically significant deviation from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) in all breeds. This heterozygosity deficit was confirmed by a positive fixation index (Fis), determining a moderate inbreeding in each breed. Simulating a soft selection, where only rams having at least a VRQ allele should be excluded from reproduction, Ho, uHe and Fis values remained almost unchanged, indicating that genetic variability should not be affected by the removal of these individuals. With a mild selection scenario, considering only rams with at least one ARR allele, we observed a decrease in the mean alleles per breed (8.9) and the maintenance of heterozygosity deficiency, except for two breeds, where it was any longer significant. These results showed that selection strategies allowing use of heterozygous as well homozygous ARR rams might be the right compromise to improve resistance to scrapie and to do not dramatically affect genetic variability of these breeds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalleles 3agenetic selection 3agenetic variation 3aheterozygosity 3ahomozygosity 3aloci 3amicrosatellite repeats 3apedigree 3aprions 3ascrapie 3aItaly1 aDalvit, Chiara1 aCaldon, Mauro1 aZulian, Laura1 aColamonico, Rosa1 aTrincanato, Simone1 aMock, Barbara1 aReale, Stefano1 aMutinelli, Franco1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2903-93901 aGranato, Anna1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1595-43470 tJournal of animal breeding and genetics.g2020 July, v. 137, no. 4 p.395-406dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl57793x0931-26687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jbg.124783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04345naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245017800169300001600347520251900363592002802882650002302910650002902933650001602962650001402978650002702992650001603019650002203035650001703057650001903074650001303093650001403106650001503120650001403135650002103149650001103170650001603181650001003197650002103207650002003228651001003248653001703258653002303275653003503298653002003333653002803353653001603381653002703397700001803424700002203442700002403464700001903488700002603507773011603533856008503649852000903734655001203743IND60630362320221121225457.0191004e20190415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063036232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2019.02.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKeram, Ayjamal10aGap dynamics of natural Populus euphratica floodplain forests affected by hydrological alteration along the Tarim River: Implications for restoration of the riparian forests  ap. 103-113.  aDue to climate change and excessive human activities, runoff dynamics of the Tarim River in northwest China become more pronounced. Understanding the effects of hydrological alteration on the life strategy and dynamics of the Populus euphratica riparian forests is becoming increasingly important. Forest gaps led by such disturbances change the structure and function of the desert riparian forest ecosystems. However, there is a lack of research on the gap formation and dynamics of this special forest type, for which the main driving force of the gap disturbance has always been unknown. In this study, we investigated several parameters of P. euphratica forest gap, such as gap size, gap age, gap fraction, and gap makers to quantify the gap disturbance regimes in the natural floodplain forests along the Tarim River in arid northwest China. In the middle reaches of the Tarim River, a total number of 263 gap makers and 60 gaps in six 50 m × 50 m plots with a total area of 1.5 hm2 were investigated. The result showed that gap fraction was <5%, and approximately 28.5% of the expanded gaps were from 1.0 to 1.2 in size (ratio of gap diameter to tree height), especially when formed around 1997–2006. The median size of the expanded gap (140.57 m2) in the desert riparian forests was smaller than in tropical forests. P. euphratica was the most abundant gap maker, and its share among gap makers was 12–14 times larger than another species. Furthermore, gap makers contributed to the forest gap size, as shown by a significant correlation between the number of gap makers and the size of expanded gaps, especially those that had been created 50–60 years ago (R2 = 0.455, P < 0.01). The DBH distribution of living trees versus dead trees showed that most P. euphratica mortality occurred in small size classes. However, living trees were equally frequent in large classes, which suggested that large trees were not exclusively injured or died in these P. euphratica stands that were affected by poor habitats, such as water scarcity. We concluded that climate change and anthropogenic activities (increasing water use for irrigation) since the 1970s led to the progressive decrease in water resources at the regional scale and resulted in a higher frequency of forest gaps in the riparian forests along the Tarim River. The results of this study provide useful implications for ecological restoration of P. euphratica to improve sustainable management of desert riparian forests.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPopulus euphratica 3aanthropogenic activities 3acanopy gaps 3adead wood 3aecological restoration 3afloodplains 3aforest ecosystems 3aforest types 3aglobal warming 3ahabitats 3ahydrology 3airrigation 3amortality 3ariparian forests 3arivers 3atree height 3atrees 3atropical forests 3awater shortages 3aChina 0aGap dynamics 0aPopulus euphratica 0aForest regeneration/succession 0aRiparian forest 0aHydrological alteration 0aTarim River 0aEcological restoration1 aHalik, Ümüt1 aKeyimu, Maierdang1 aAishan, Tayierjiang1 aMamat, Zulpiya1 aRouzi, Aihemaitijiang0 tForest ecology and management.g2019 Apr. 15, v. 438 p.103-113dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2019.02.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03409naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006300140245008100203300001800284520156000302592002801862650002101890650003101911650002501942650001801967650003101985650001602016650001802032650001402050650001702064650001302081650002502094650002102119650001102140650003602151650001802187650002402205650000902229650001702238650001902255650000902274650002702283650001902310650002202329650001702351650003602368650003202404700001702436700001602453700001902469700001902488700001702507700001602524700001802540700001702558773012502575856007402700852000902774655001202783IND60621064720221121190933.0181115e20181114xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062106472DNAL7 a10.1039/c8fo01445k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJinThese authors contributed equally to this work., Jialei10aIsofraxidin targets the TLR4/MD-2 axis to prevent osteoarthritis development  ap. 5641-5652.  aOsteoarthritis (OA) is a major cause of joint pain and disability, resulting in large socioeconomic costs worldwide. Isofraxidin (ISO), a bioactive coumarin compound isolated from the functional foods Siberian ginseng and Apium graveolens, exerts anti-inflammatory effects in a variety of diseases. However, no studies have reported the protective effects of ISO against OA development. Accordingly, this study aimed to assess the therapeutic effect of ISO in human OA chondrocytes, and in a mouse model of OA induced by destabilisation of the medial meniscus (DMM). In vitro, lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced overproduction of nitric oxide (NO), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) was decreased by ISO pre-treatment. Furthermore, ISO attenuated the increased expression of inflammatory enzymes, including inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), in response to LPS stimulation. Meanwhile, LPS-induced extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation was also reversed by ISO treatment. Mechanistically, ISO competitively inhibited Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)/myeloid differentiation protein-2 (MD-2) complex formation, and thus TLR4/nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signalling cascades. In vivo, ISO treatment not only prevented the calcification and erosion of cartilage, as well as the thickening of subchondral bone, but also reduced the serum levels of inflammatory cytokines in the mouse OA model. Taken together, these data suggest that ISO has potential in the treatment of OA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aApium graveolens 3aEleutherococcus senticosus 3aToll-like receptor 4 3aanimal models 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3ablood serum 3acalcification 3acartilage 3achondrocytes 3acoumarin 3aextracellular matrix 3afunctional foods 3ahumans 3ainducible nitric oxide synthase 3ainterleukin-6 3alipopolysaccharides 3amice 3anitric oxide 3aosteoarthritis 3apain 3aprostaglandin synthase 3aprostaglandins 3aprotective effect 3atherapeutics 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha1 aYu, Xingfang1 aHu, Zhichao1 aTang, Shangkun1 aZhong, Xinyang1 aXu, Jianchen1 aShang, Ping1 aHuang, Yixing1 aLiu, Haixiao0 tFood & function.g2018 Nov. 14, v. 9, no. 11 p.5641-5652dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26907x2042-650X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8fo01445k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02423naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002900139245006400168300001600232500001900248500002000267520124100287592002801528596001301556650001101569650001201580650001101592650001501603650000901618650001101627650001701638650001001655650001101665650002601676650000901702700002001711700006001731773014001791856007301931852000902004655001202013IND60698440620221119114229.0200612e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069844062DNAL7 a10.1111/jbg.124492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVargas Jurado, Napoleón10aLamb wool shedding is a good predictor of ewe wool shedding  ap. 365-373.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aInterest in reducing labour costs due to shearing has led to development of breed types that shed their wool naturally. Selection at young ages can facilitate response. Reliability of predictions of adult from lamb wool shedding (WS) is thus key in the design of breeding programmes to increase shedding. Our objectives were to estimate heritabilities and genetic relationships between WS measured once in lambs and repeatedly in ewes and to assess the accuracy of lamb WS EBV to predict ewe WS EBV based on a multi‐trait threshold or a repeatability model. Data were 4,971 lamb and 3,335 ewe WS records on a Romanov, White Dorper and Katahdin composite flock. For the multivariate model, WS heritability ranged from 0.47 ± 0.03 in lambs to 0.59 ± 0.04 at 1 year of age. For the repeatability model, WS in adult ewes was moderately heritable (0.50 ± 0.03) and repeatable (0.60 ± 0.02). Genetic correlations were 0.72 ± 0.04, 0.65 ± 0.05, 0.50 ± 0.09 and 0.51 ± 0.09 between lamb WS and 1st through 4th record, respectively. Given the moderately high heritability and high correlations between WS performance in lambs and ewes, selecting animals early in life would effectively increase WS in crossbred flocks.  aPublisher supplied data  cSENESCYT 3aDorper 3aRomanov 3aadults 3acrossbreds 3aewes 3aflocks 3aheritability 3alabor 3amodels 3amultivariate analysis 3awool1 aKuehn, Larry A.1 aLewis, Ronald M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1658-443X0 tJournal of animal breeding and genetics.g2020 July, v. 137, no. 4 p.365-373dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl57793x0931-26687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jbg.124493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03164naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245011800167500001900285520182200304592002802126650001602154650002702170650002202197650001502219650001802234650004402252650001602296653003202312653002102344653001902365653001802384700001302402700001702415700001302432700002002445700001702465700005802482773010602540856008702646852000902733655001202742IND60731478420221120045200.0210423e20210605xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073147842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2021.1264662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Cong10aPhysicochemical aspects of zwitterionic core-shell tecto dendrimers characterized by a thorough NMR investigation  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aCore-shell tecto dendrimers (CSTDs) are a class of superstructured dendrimeric nanoconstructs with similar structural characteristics and biomedical performances to the high-generation dendrimers that can be decorated with zwitterions to be availed of good antifouling properties for different biomedical applications. Characterization of the CSTD-based dendrimeric derivatives remains to be a great challenge. Here, we attempted to utilize nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) technologies to investigate the structure and hydrodynamic size of CSTDs functionalized with zwitterionic carboxybetaine acrylamide (CBAA) and confirmed their antifouling property through protein resistance assay. In this study, we initially prepared CSTDs by supramolecular assembly of beta-cyclodextrin (β-CD)-modified generation 5 (G5) poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimers as cores and adamantane (Ad)-decorated G3 PAMAM dendrimers as shells, and then partially modified the CSTD terminal amines with CBAA. The dendrimeric products were thoroughly characterized. Our results show that the obtained CSTDs display strong correlation signals between the Ad and β-CD protons in the two-dimensional NMR spectrum, indicating the strong host-guest interaction existing between G3-Ad and G5-CD in the structure of CSTDs. Diffusion NMR measurements reveal that the hydrodynamic diameter of CSTDs is smaller after partial CBAA surface modification, possibly due to the tightened molecular volume after zwitterionic modification. Lastly, the CBAA-modified CSTDs were demonstrated to have good antifouling property through protein resistance assay. Our findings provide a new strategy to study the framework of the developed CSTDs and CBAA-modified CSTDs, facilitating their further design and surface modification for various biomedical applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacrylamides 3aantifouling activities 3abeta-cyclodextrin 3adendrimers 3ahydrodynamics 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3azwitterions 0aCore-shell tecto dendrimers 0aCharacterization 0aNMR techniques 0aDiffusion NMR1 aGao, Yue1 aChen, Jipeng1 aWang, Le1 aBanyai, Istvan,1 aShen, Mingwu1 aShi, Xiangyang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6785-66450 tColloids and surfaces.g2021 June 05, v. 618 p.126466-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2021.1264663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03691naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245013600161300001800297500002000315520147100335592002801806596012001834596006401954596012102018596005902139596005902198596005902257596005902316596009202375596006302467650001502530650001802545650001702563650001602580650001502596650002002611650001702631650001302648650002202661650002002683650001702703650002202720700002002742700001802762700001802780700005502798700005902853773015302912856007503065852000903140655001203149IND60756353220221121172059.0211113e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075635322DNAL7 a10.1111/ijfs.152992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSheng, Kangliang10aEncapsulation and characterisation of grape seed proanthocyanidin extract using sodium alginate and different cellulose derivatives  ap. 6420-6430.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aGrape seed proanthocyanidin extract (GSPE) has health benefits. However, these phenolic compounds undergo degradation reactions and have undesirable sensorial characteristics. GSPE was encapsulated using sodium alginate (SA), SA‐methyl cellulose (MC) and SA‐hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) for promoting controlled release, pH stability, temperature and storage period tolerance of GSPE. The microcapsules were characterised using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Fourier transform infra‐red (FTIR) analysis. The SA‐MC and SA‐HPMC microcapsules appeared to have a more compact surface than SA‐alone microcapsules. FTIR analysis indicated successful immobilisation of GSPE into the polymeric microcapsules. Moreover, the SA‐MC and SA‐HPMC microcapsules showed higher thermal stability. The microcapsules showed a relatively higher amount of released GSPE at a pH above six than at a lower pH. The SA‐MC and SA‐HPMC microcapsules could be used to retain more GSPE content in the gastric phase and to release it in the intestinal phase for possible absorption. Furthermore, after 28 days of storage at 25 °C, the GSPE retention rate of the microcapsules was still higher than 80%. GSPE encapsulated in SA‐MC and SA‐HPMC microcapsules results in lesser degradation and can be absorbed more effectively. This method has potential for the delivery of colon‐specific materials while exhibiting a sustained‐release characteristic.  aPublisher supplied data  cOpen fund for Discipline Construction, Institute of Physical Science and Information Technology of Anhui University  cDoctoral Scientific Research Foundation of Anhui University  aSKLF‐KF‐201920cOpen Project Program of State Key Laboratory of Food Science and Technology, Jiangnan University  a32000081cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31470218cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31770066cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  cOutstanding Talents Program of Anhui University, China  aKJ2019A0040cNatural Science Foundation of Anhui Higher Education Institutions of China  a1908085QC120cNatural Science Foundation of Anhui Province 3aabsorption 3aencapsulation 3afood science 3agrape seeds 3aintestines 3amethylcellulose 3apH stability 3apolymers 3aproanthocyanidins 3asodium alginate 3astorage time 3athermal stability1 aZhang, Guanghui1 aKong, Xiaowei1 aWang, Jingmin1 aMu, Wanmeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6597-527X1 aWang, Yongzhong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8231-71530 tInternational journal of food science & technology.g2021 Dec., v. 56, no. 12 p.6420-6430dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl41365x0950-54237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ijfs.152993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02687naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245013700167520128700304592002801591650001701619650001701636650001901653650002001672650001501692650002501707650002901732650001801761650002201779650001101801650001501812650001301827650000901840650001201849651001001861653002101871653003101892653002001923653003201943700001901975700002201994773011802016856008602134852000902220655001202229IND60687355520221120101418.0210201e20200615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068735552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2020.1104552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChams, Nour10aBeyond scientific contribution: Assessment of the societal impact of research and innovation to build a sustainable agri-food sector  aDue to the climate change and increased attention toward environmental management issues, the agri-food sector has been extensively relying on research, development, and innovation (RDi) to transform conventional agricultural production into a sustainable and eco-friendly industry. While the academic contribution of research has been relatively easily identified in the literature, the assessment of its societal impact remains underdeveloped. Accordingly, this study employs mixed-method evaluation approaches, mainly ASIRPA framework and Impact Oriented Monitoring (IOM) model to better understand and measure the multi-dimensional impacts of RDi in the agri-food sector in Spain. The objective of this analysis is to identify the impact of research on the society and the ecosystem. An in-depth case study analysis is conducted to examine the “best practices” program to promote sustainable techniques in the rice cultivation. Empirical findings suggest a standardized index to measure the economic, socio-territorial, health, political, capacity building, and environmental impacts, involving the stakeholder-network evaluation. The study highlights important implications for firm management decisions monitoring research uptake and policy design in the agri-food sector.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOryza sativa 3acase studies 3aclimate change 3acrop production 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental impact 3aenvironmental management 3afood industry 3aissues and policy 3amodels 3amonitoring 3apolitics 3arice 3asociety 3aSpain 0aResearch outcome 0aSustainability performance 0aSocietal impact 0aInnovative agri-food sector1 aGuesmi, Bouali1 aGil, José María0 tJournal of environmental management.g2020 June 15, v. 264 p.110455-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2020.1104553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01968naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245007900171500001400250520089400264592002801158650003601186650001901222650002301241650001601264650001601280653001501296653002301311653001301334653001801347700001501365700001601380700001401396773010001410856008701510852000901597655001201606IND60710794320221121044422.0210212e20210215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071079432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2020.1280482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Mengyuan10aEffects of theaflavins on the structure and function of bovine lactoferrin  aNAL-light  aIn this study, theaflavins were used to interact with bovine lactoferrin (bLF) to observe the effects of theaflavins on the structure and functionality of bLF. Spectral experiments verified that theaflavins were able to interact with bLF by a static quenching method. The circular dichroism experiment further showed that the combination of theaflavins would lead a certain change in the structure of bLF. By comparing the calculated data of the spectral experiment and the degree of structural change after bLF binding to theaflavins, the theaflavin-3, 3′-digallate (TFDG), which had the strongest effect on the structure of bLF, was selected to explore its influence on effects of bLF functionality. Conclusions were drawn from iron binding, enzyme-linked immunosorbent and in vitro simulated digestion experiments-the addition of TFDG had a certain effect on the functionality of bLF.  aPublisher supplied data 3acircular dichroism spectroscopy 3afood chemistry 3ain vitro digestion 3alactoferrin 3atheaflavins 0aTheaflavin 0aBovine lactoferrin 0aSpectrum 0aFunctionality1 aXu, Jinhui1 aHan, Tinglu1 aTang, Lin0 tFood chemistry.g2021 Feb. 15, v. 338 p.128048-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2020.1280483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03132naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004600094040001800140100001900158245011800177300001600295520157200311592002801883650002101911650002601932650002801958650002401986650002902010650000902039650002802048650000902076650001702085650001702102650001602119650002102135650002102156650001702177650002202194650001802216650002502234650002202259653002102281653001702302653001702319653001302336700001602349700002402365700001602389773010702405856009302512852000902605655001202614IND60525205220221121182751.0190318e20160301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052520522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.theriogenology.2015.09.0542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGenís, Sandra10aPotential of lactic acid bacteria at regulating Escherichia coli infection and inflammation of bovine endometrium  ap. 625-637.  aAbout 40% of dairy cattle develop uterine disease during postpartum period, causing infertility. Some studies indicate that uterine infection, predominantly by Escherichia coli in the first week postpartum, is associated with metritis, an uterus inflammation in which the cow fails to completely clear bacterial contaminants. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential of four lactic acid bacteria (LAB) (Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Pediococcus acidilactici, Lactobacillus reuteri, and Lactobacillus sakei) to modulate the E coli infection and inflammation in endometrial cells. Primary endometrial epithelial cells were isolated from fresh endometrium of a healthy cow and cultured in vitro to evaluate the effects of LAB at three different doses. Cell extracts were obtained to analyze the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and to quantify E coli infection on MacConkey agar plates. L sakei and L reuteri showed a positive effect preventing E coli infection (87% and 78%, respectively, P < 0.001); however, they were also associated to a dose-variable effect on tissular inflammation that could further exacerbate the proinflammatory status. Infection of E coli was clearly reduced (P < 0.001) up to an 83% with P acidilactici, whereas, the expression of proinflammatory cytokines IL-8 and IL-1β dropped significantly (P < 0.001) up to 85.11 and 5.24 folds, respectively, in the presence of L rhamnosus. In conclusion, these results demonstrate a clear potential of some LAB in the modulation of endometrial infection and inflammation in cattle.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aLactobacillus reuteri 3aLactobacillus rhamnosus 3aLactobacillus sakei 3aPediococcus acidilactici 3aagar 3abacterial contamination 3acows 3adairy cattle 3aendometritis 3aendometrium 3aepithelial cells 3ain vitro culture 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-1beta 3ainterleukin-8 3alactic acid bacteria 3apostpartum period 0aEscherichia coli 0aInflammation 0aLAB bacteria 0aMetritis1 aBach, Alex,1 aFàbregas, Francesc1 aArís, Anna0 tTheriogenology.g2016 Mar. 01, v. 85, no. 4 p.625-637dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl5209x0093-691X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2015.09.0543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03101naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005700139245010800196300001600304500002000320520182500340592002802165596003702193596001602230650002402246650001102270650000902281650001502290650001402305650002302319650002302342650001102365650002202376650002202398700002402420700002602444700001602470773012202486856007402608852000902682655001202691IND60787067720221118154129.0220807e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078706772DNAL7 a10.1111/jfb.143962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMinder, Mario1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1391-694510aDietary specificity and overlap in endorheic river fishes: How do native and nonnative species compare?  ap. 453-464.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe introduction of nonnative species is one of the most critical problems facing freshwater systems today. The rivers of the Great Basin (USA) have been particularly imperilled by nonnative species introductions and represent a valuable location to study the dietary trends of native and nonnative fishes in isolated, endorheic systems. We collected fish from 23 sites, spanning three Great Basin watersheds (Carson, Humboldt and Bear Rivers) and two elevation categories (upland and lowland). Only a single species (speckled dace Rhinichthys osculus) occurred in both elevation zones. Diet item analyses of over 500 fish stomachs indicated significant dietary overlaps between native and nonnative fishes and detailed dietary selectivity for all species. This finding, along with the low species diversity observed in the region, suggests low dietary niche diversity, which could have the potential to amplify the competitive impacts of nonnatives on native species. In upland sites, nonnative trouts were the dominant invaders, while in lowland sites warm‐water nonnatives were prevalent. The management implications we recommend based on our results urge for continued monitoring of water temperature and species occurrences to predict if dietary overlaps observed in this study are likely to change in the future. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The Great Basin is an ideal endorheic region to study dietary trends in native and nonnative fishes. These trends are important in predicting competitive interactions among fishes. By looking at the diets of fishes within this region we were able to identify multiple significant overlaps among native and nonnative fishes. These results represent a baseline for future studies in the region as well as being comparable to other regions with similar invasive/native overlaps.  aPublisher supplied data  a1442595cNSF Macrosystem Biology  c10 Co‐PIs 3aRhinichthys osculus 3abasins 3adiet 3afreshwater 3ahighlands 3aindigenous species 3aintroduced species 3arivers 3aspecies diversity 3awater temperature1 aArsenault, Emily R.1 aErdenee, Bolortsetseg1 aPyron, Mark0 tJournal of fish biology.g2020 Aug., v. 97, no. 2 p.453-464dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:13582x0022-11127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfb.143963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02929naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002200145245016600167300001200333520143500345592002801780650002101808650002201829650001301851650001101864650001201875650001301887650001801900650001301918650001401931650005201945650003001997650003302027650001302060650001202073651001002085700001902095700003602114700001902150700001702169700002202186700001802208700002402226773010902250856007902359852000902438655001202447IND60749274120221120132106.0210901e201012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074927412DNAL7 a10.1186/1743-422X-7-1892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNiyas, Kudukkil P10aMolecular characterization of Chikungunya virus isolates from clinical samples and adult Aedes albopictus mosquitoes emerged from larvae from Kerala, South India  ap. 189.  aChikungunya virus (CHIKV), an arthritogenic alphavirus, is transmitted to humans by infected Aedes (Ae.) aegypti and Ae.albopictus mosquitoes. In the study, reverse-transcription PCR (RT PCR) and virus isolation detected CHIKV in patient samples and also in adult Ae.albopictus mosquitoes that was derived from larvae collected during a chikungunya (CHIK) outbreak in Kerala in 2009. The CHIKV strains involved in the outbreak were the East, Central and South African (ECSA) genotype that had the E1 A226V mutation. The viral strains from the mosquitoes and CHIK patients from the same area showed a close relationship based on phylogenetic analysis. Genetic characterization by partial sequencing of non-structural protein 2 (nsP2; 378 bp), envelope E1 (505 bp) and E2 (428 bp) identified one critical mutation in the E2 protein coding region of these CHIKV strains. This novel, non-conservative mutation, L210Q, consistently present in both human and mosquito-derived samples studied, was within the region of the E2 protein (amino acids E2 200-220) that determines mosquito cell infectivity in many alpha viruses. Our results show the involvement of Ae. albopictus in this outbreak in Kerala and appearance of CHIKV with novel genetic changes. Detection of virus in adult mosquitoes, emerged in the laboratory from larvae, also points to the possibility of transovarial transmission (TOT) of mutant CHIKV strains in mosquitoes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAedes albopictus 3aChikungunya virus 3agenotype 3ahumans 3amutants 3amutation 3apathogenicity 3apatients 3aphylogeny 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3atransovarial transmission 3aviral nonstructural proteins 3avirology 3aviruses 3aIndia1 aAbraham, Rachy1 aUnnikrishnan, Ramakrishnan Nair1 aMathew, Thomas1 aNair, Sajith1 aManakkadan, Anoop1 aIssac, Aneesh1 aSreekumar, Easwaran0 tVirology journal.g2010 Dec., v. 7, no. 1 p.189-189dBioMed CentralwJournal:J000001738x1743-422X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1743-422X-7-1893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01500naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245010900158300001800267520037200285592002800657650002300685650001000708650001400718650001200732650001500744650001300759650001600772650001800788700001300806700001800819700001600837700001200853700001900865700001300884773013400897856007401031852000901105655001201114IND60638718520221120125807.0190430e20160324xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063871852DNAL7 a10.1039/c6cc00492j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLichuanjushi,10aAllostery in molecular self-assemblies: metal ions triggered self-assembly and emissions of terthiophene  ap. 4876-4879.  aBinding of metal ions to the head of a coordinating amphiphile TTC4L substantially changes the emission color of the terthiophene group attached to the chain end via a conformation triggered self-assembly.

Quite often more piles are created than are burned in a given year, however, causing piles to persist, accumulate, and age on the landscape. The effects of burning piles of increasing age has not been studied. We examined the effects of time since construction (i.e., pile age, in roughly six month increments for two years) and burn season (fall and spring) on fuelbed properties, combustion dynamics, fuel consumption, and charcoal formation for hand-constructed piles in thinned ponderosa pine-dominated sites in New Mexico (n = 50 piles) and Washington (n = 49 piles). Piles compacted over time similarly for both study sites, losing approximately 15 percent of their height annually for the first two years following piling. Peak flame height decreased and the duration of flaming combustion increased with increasing pile age for both burn seasons in New Mexico, yet depended on burn season in Washington. Increasing fuel moisture and compaction reduced peak flame height and increased flaming duration modestly for both sites. Peak flame height was reduced 6-7 cm and flaming duration increased 0.9-2.3 minutes for every percentage increase in small fuel moisture. Similarly, peak flame height was reduced 4-5 cm and flaming duration increased 0.6-0.8 minute for every percentage reduction in pile height. Fuel consumption was high, averaging 90 percent in New Mexico and 95 percent in Washington. Fuel consumption patterns differed between locations, however; fuel consumption decreased with age and was slightly higher for spring than fall burns in New Mexico, whereas, neither pile age nor burn season affected fuel consumption in Washington. Charcoal formation as a fraction of pre-burn pile weight averaged 2.8 percent in New Mexico and 1.2 percent in Washington, and was not affected by pile age or burn season. Fuel consumption and charcoal production were unaffected by fuel moisture or compaction levels at either site. Findings from this study will inform fuel and fire managers about the potential effects on fire behavior, fuel consumption, and charcoal formation of burning piles of different age in different seasons under different environmental conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautumn 3aburning 3acharcoal 3acombustion 3aenergy use and consumption 3aenvironmental factors 3afire behavior 3afuel moisture index 3afuels 3alandscapes 3aspring 3aNew Mexico 3aWashington (state) 0acharcoal 0adry conifer forest 0aflame height 0aflaming duration 0afuel treatment 0apile burning1 aEvans, Alexander M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5700-82711 aGrove, Sara1 aHaubensak, Karen A.0 tForest ecology and management.g2019 Feb. 01, dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2019.02.0053Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/FS  aDNAL 7aarticle02761naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001600154245008800170520137500258592002801633650002401661650000901685650002301694650001601717650001001733650001001743650001101753650001001764650001101774650001701785650001501802650001601817653000701833653000701840653000801847653000801855653000801863653000801871653000801879653000801887653001201895653001601907653002701923653004101950700001801991700001802009773011802027856008902145852000902234655001202243IND60790030920221116150859.0221004e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079003092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2022.1154092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAn, Su Hyun10aStandardized ileal digestible lysine requirements of 21–28 days old male broilers  aThe objective of this study was to estimate the standardized ileal digestible (SID) lysine (Lys) requirement for male broiler chickens at the age of 21–28 days. A total of 240 (21 days old) Ross 308 broilers (842 ± 43.9 g; mean ± SD) were allocated to six different dietary treatments in a randomized complete block design with eight replicate cages per treatment. The six experimental diets were formulated based on corn, soybean meal, and synthetic amino acids to contain dietary SID Lys equally increased from 7.5 g/kg to 12.5 g/kg, with a consistent concentration of all amino acids except for Lys. As the SID Lys increased in the experimental diet, the weight gain, feed intake, and G:F increased linearly (P < 0.05) and quadratically (P < 0.05). The Lys intake linearly (P < 0.01) increased as the SID Lys concentration increased. The SID Lys requirements for weight gain and G:F were 10.6 g/kg and 10.9 g/kg for the one-slope broken-line, 11.6 g/kg and 12.1 g/kg for the quadratic line, and 11.0 g/kg and 11.5 g/kg for 95 % of the upper asymptote of the quadratic model, respectively. In summary, the dietary SID Lys for optimum body weight gain and G:F of 21–28 days old male broilers were 10.7 g/kg and 10.9 g/kg, respectively. In addition, the SID Lys for maximum body weight gain and G:F were 11.6 g/kg and 12.1 g/kg, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3abody weight changes 3acorn 3aexperimental diets 3afeed intake 3afeeds 3aileum 3alysine 3amales 3amodels 3asoybean meal 3atechnology 3aweight gain 0aAA 0aBW 0aBWG 0aFCR 0aG:F 0aLys 0aSID 0aSBM 0aBroiler 0aRequirement 0aIdeal amino acid ratio 0aStandardized ileal digestible lysine1 aKang, Hwan-Ku1 aKong, Changsu0 tAnimal feed science and technology.g2022 Oct., v. 292 p.115409-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl7460x0377-84017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2022.1154093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02957naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002300152245011600175300001600291520145800307592002801765650001501793650001801808650001101826650001901837650002401856650001101880650001301891650001301904650002401917650001101941650001101952650001701963650001101980650001301991650001602004650001102020653004902031653001302080653002402093653002702117653002702144700002302171700003002194700003002224773010202254856008602356852000902442655001202451IND60581064420221119103429.0171005e20160915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058106442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2016.07.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTippawan, Phanicha10aUsing glycerol for hydrogen production via sorption-enhanced chemical looping reforming: Thermodynamic analysis  ap. 325-332.  aSorption enhanced-chemical looping reforming (SECLR), which combines a chemical looping reforming method (CLR) and a sorption-enhanced reforming method (SER) in a single-stage process, is proposed for the hydrogen production from glycerol. The model of the SECLR process using a solid oxygen carrier and CO2 absorbent is developed using a flowsheet simulator. The comparison between chemical looping reforming (CLR) with/without CaO sorbent is investigated. The results show that the addition of CaO sorbent provides an increase in a hydrogen concentration. The SECLR process is then deeply analyzed by considering the effect of the primary parameters on its performance in terms of hydrogen production, carbon formation and net energy requirements. The parametric analysis indicates that operating the SECLR at a steam-to-glycerol molar ratio higher than two and a sufficient calcium oxide-to-glycerol molar ratio of three can inhibit the formation of carbon. The hydrogen yield increases significantly upon increasing the reforming temperature. The required energy of the process varies with the amount of nickel oxide used as a solid oxygen carrier. The exergy analysis is considered to identify the optimal operation for self-sufficient energy and the results show that the operation of the SECLR at the nickel oxide-to-glycerol molar ratio of 1.87 is sufficient to be the most optimal condition with regard to both energy and exergy considerations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorbents 3acalcium oxide 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3aenergy requirements 3aexergy 3aglycerol 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen production 3amodels 3anickel 3anickel oxide 3aoxygen 3asorption 3atemperature 3ayields 0aSorption enhanced-chemical looping reforming 0aGlycerol 0aHydrogen production 0aThermodynamic analysis 0aSelf-sufficient energy1 aThammasit, Tidtaya1 aAssabumrungrat, Suttichai1 aArpornwichanop, Amornchai0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2016 Sept. 15, v. 124 p.325-332dElsevier Ltdx0196-89047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2016.07.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03403naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002000146245009000166520205600256592002802312650001802340650001902358650001202377650001102389650001402400650002002414650001002434650001102444650001502455650001802470650001402488650002302502650001502525650002202540650002402562650001902586650002402605650002202629650001502651651001102666700002002677700002402697773012202721856008102843852000902924655001202933IND60682778120221119170715.0200722e20200101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068277812DNAL7 a10.3390/resources90100032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSłyś, Daniel 13aAn Analysis of Waste Heat Recovery from Wastewater on Livestock and Agriculture Farms  aAgriculture is one of the sectors of the economy in which it is possible to conduct much more rational energy economy. The easiest way to achieve financial savings as well as reduce air pollution is to use waste heat sources. Heat pumps are perfect for this. Particularly favorable is the case when the device can operate in an alternative system and serve both heating and cooling purposes. The purpose of this article was to present possible solutions for installations enabling heat recovery from wastewater to supply agri-breeding farms with hot utility and technological water, a financial analysis of their application, and an assessment of the impact of these solutions on possible reduction of pollutant emissions. The tests were carried out for four variants of cooperation between a heat pump and an exchanger. In the first variant, waste heat was used in the process of heating water used to clean stands and prepare feed. In the second variant, waste heat took part in heating the water used for watering plants. In the third variant, waste heat was used in the process of drying cereals. In turn, in the last variant, waste heat supported the preparation of utility hot water for the breeder’s residential building. The study showed the legitimacy of using thermal energy from liquid manure as a waste heat source on farms and farming. This is mainly due to the short payback period, which can be within 2–4 years. In turn, the analysis of pollution reduction associated with the recovery of waste energy showed that the use of heat pumps allowed a significant reduction in the emission of harmful compounds to the atmosphere, in particular carbon dioxide. It is worth noting that livestock breeding is one of the most important branches of agricultural production not only in Poland but also throughout Europe, Asia and South and North America. For this reason, the use of waste heat-recovery systems enables real savings in the purchase of energy and reduction of pollutant emissions arising during traditional production processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair pollution 3acarbon dioxide 3acooling 3adrying 3aemissions 3afarming systems 3afarms 3agrains 3aheat pumps 3aliquid manure 3alivestock 3alivestock breeding 3apollutants 3apollution control 3aresidential housing 3athermal energy 3awaste heat recovery 3awaste utilization 3awastewater 3aPoland1 aPochwat, Kamil 1 aCzarniecki, Dorian 0 tResources.g2020 Jan. 01, v. 9, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21558x2079-92767nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/resources90100033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02697naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001200140245015000152300002000302520141200322592002801734650002201762650001101784650001701795650000901812650001301821650002101834650001601855650001601871700001701887700001501904700001301919700001301932700002101945700001201966700002901978700001802007700002302025773014402048856007402192852000902266655001202275IND60670819420221118060501.0191002e20140909xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067081942DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ta02895c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTao, Li10aGel electrolyte materials formed from a series of novel low molecular mass organogelators for stable quasi-solid-state dye-sensitized solar cells  ap. 15921-15930.  aElectrolyte materials are the key components in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) and are very crucial to the performance and long-term stability of DSCs. We developed a series of diamide derivatives as novel low molecular mass organogelators (LMOGs) for DSCs. These LMOGs contain different numbers (2, 6, 5 and 9) of methylene groups (–CH₂–) between the two amide carbonyl groups and exhibit distinctive self-assembly behaviors. The gel electrolytes prepared by these LMOGs possess high gel-to-solution transition temperatures (over 100 °C) and the stability of DSCs is largely enhanced. More importantly, the parity of the number of –CH₂– and their special molecular arrangements have a remarkable influence on the self-assembly of the gelators resulting in a significantly different morphology, and further influence the photovoltaic performances of DSCs. It is found that the LMOGs containing odd-numbered –CH₂– lead to a much better charge transport of the gel electrolytes, inducing a longer electron lifetime and higher incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency compared with the LMOGs containing even-numbered –CH₂–. Finally, a superior quasi-solid-state DSC based on the gelator containing five –CH₂– is obtained, which exhibits a photoelectric conversion efficiency of 7.53% and excellent thermal and light-soaking stabilities during accelerated aging tests.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaccelerated aging 3aamides 3aelectrolytes 3agels 3amoieties 3amolecular weight 3asolar cells 3atemperature1 aHuo, Zhipeng1 aDing, Yong1 aWang, Lu1 aZhu, Jun1 aZhang, Changneng1 aPan, Xu1 aNazeeruddin, Mohammad K.1 aDai, Songyuan1 aGrätzel, Michael,0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2014 Sept. 9, v. 2, no. 38 p.15921-15930dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ta02895c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02649naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100001600148245017400164300001600338500001900354520146200373592002801835650002201863650001901885650002001904650003501924650003001959650001601989650001702005650001502022700003202037700002502069773011202094856008402206852000902290655001202299IND6036911320221119094028.0141112e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND603691132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.plaphy.2011.02.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGago, Jorge10aVascular-specific expression of GUS and GFP reporter genes in transgenic grapevine (Vitis vinifera L. cv.

Hitherto, constitutive promoters have been used generally to study the effects of transgene expression in grapevine. Given the fact that constitutive gene expression may be harmful to the host plant, affecting plant growth and development, the use of tissue -specific promoters restricting gene expression to tissues of interest and at given developmental stages could be more appropriate. For this purpose, we decided to study in grapevine the activity of the Eucalyptus gunnii CCR promoter that was previously reported to be vascular-preferential. We transformed grapevine with the “Sonication assisted Agrobacterium-mediated transformation” (SAAT) method and a construct where both GUS and GFP (green fluorescent protein) marker genes were under control of the EgCCR promoter. High GUS and GFP activities were found to be associated with the newly formed vascular tissues in stems, leaves and petioles of transformed grapevine, suggesting a preferential activity of the EgCCR promoter in the vascular tissues of grapevine. These results suggest the tissue-specificity of this promoter from eucalyptus is conserved in grapevine and that it could be used to drive expression of defense genes in order to enhance resistance against vascular pathogens.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEucalyptus gunnii 3aVitis vinifera 3agene expression 3agenetically modified organisms 3agreen fluorescent protein 3ahost plants 3aplant growth 3asonication1 aGrima-Pettenati, Jacqueline1 aGallego, Pedro Pablo0 tPlant physiology and biochemistry.g2011 Apr., v. 49, no. 4 p.413-419dElsevier Masson SASx0981-94287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plaphy.2011.02.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02541naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100006300152245011000215500001400325520108100339592002801420650002601448650001701474650002501491650001101516650002401527650001201551650001401563650001401577650001901591650001901610650001101629650002301640653001601663653001001679653001401689653002301703700005801726700002001784700002301804700006001827773010001887856008701987852000902074655001202083IND60710794620221121044307.0201104e20210301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071079462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2020.1280522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarsol-Vall, Alexis1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6860-023810aInfluence of enzymatic treatment on the chemical composition of lingonberry (Vaccinium vitis-idaea) juice  aNAL-light  aThe effects of different enzymes, their dosages, and incubation times on juice yield and chemical composition of lingonberry juice were assessed. Nonvolatile composition including sugars, acids and phenolic compounds (anthocyanins, hydroxycinnamic acids, flavonols and flavan-3-ols) was analyzed using GC-FID, LC-DAD and LC-MS methods, whereas the volatile compound profile was examined using HS-SPME-GC–MS. Selection of the enzyme had a significant effect on the juice yield by increasing it from 70% without enzyme treatment up to 81%. Enzymes significantly increased the contents of most of the phenolic compounds in the juices but had little impact on the contents of sugars and acids. Heat treatment without enzyme addition also significantly affected the composition. Generally, increasing incubation time increased the contents of various phenolic compounds, especially flavan-3-ols and hydroxycinnamic acids, whereas the effects of dosage were mostly negligible. Enzyme treatment increased the contents of volatile compounds, regardless of dosage or incubation time.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVaccinium vitis-idaea 3aanthocyanins 3achemical composition 3adosage 3aenzymatic treatment 3aenzymes 3aflavanols 3aflavonols 3afood chemistry 3aheat treatment 3ajuices 3avolatile compounds 0aLingonberry 0aJuice 0aVolatiles 0aPhenolic compounds1 aKelanne, Niina1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7962-05841 aNuutinen, Antti1 aYang, B.q(Baoru),1 aLaaksonen, Oskar1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2467-85640 tFood chemistry.g2021 Mar. 01, v. 339 p.128052-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2020.1280523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02095naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245009100171520099500262592002801257650002101285650002301306650001901329650002001348650001801368650001301386700002401399700002801423700001901451700002201470700005901492773011101551856008601662852000901748655001201757IND60727947020221120075305.0210423e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072794702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.idairyj.2021.1050272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPujato, Silvina10aAnalysis of CRISPR systems of types II-A, I-E and I-C in strains of Lacticaseibacillus  aA total of 49 strains of Lacticaseibacillus were screened for the presence of CRISPR-Cas systems. Type II-A CRISPR-Cas loci were sequenced for 8 Lacticaseibacillus paracasei and 3 Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus strains. They contained 21 to 49 spacers, a few of them with similarity to plasmids. Cas9 identity was well correlated with spacer content of the strains.

To study the structure-function relationship of coat protein (CP) of LSV, to investigate antigenic relationships between coat protein subunits or intact virons, and to prepare specific antibodies against LSV, substantial amounts of CP protein are needed. RESULTS: Thus, full-length cDNA of LSV coat protein was synthesized and amplified by RT-PCR from RNA isolated from LSV Lanzhou isolate. The extended 33.6 kDa CP was cloned and expressed prokaryoticly and then purified by Ni-ion affinity chromatography. Its identity and antigenicity of recombinant CP were identified on Western-blotting by using the prepared anti-LSV antibodies. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that fusion CP maintains its native antigenicity and specificity, providing a good source of antigen in preparation of LSV related antibodies. Detailed structural analysis of a pure recombinant CP should allow a better understanding of its role in cell attachment and LSV tropism. This investigation to LSV should provide some specific antibodies and aid to development a detection system for LSV diagnostics and epidemiologic surveys.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLily symptomless virus 3aRNA 3aWestern blotting 3aaffinity chromatography 3aantigens 3abulbs 3acoat proteins 3adiagnostic techniques 3aflowers 3astructure-activity relationships 3avirology1 aWang, Guangpeng1 aZhao, Qi1 aZhang, Yu1 aAn, Lizhe1 aWang, Yun0 tVirology journal.g2010 Dec., v. 7, no. 1 p.34-34dBioMed CentralwJournal:J000001738x1743-422X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1743-422X-7-343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02934naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245010900161300001600270520141400286592002801700650002201728650001201750650001701762650001201779650001601791650002501807650002501832650001701857650001801874650001601892650001101908650001601919650001901935650001101954650001801965653002901983653001702012653001302029653001502042653001202057700002302069700002302092700002302115700002002138700001702158773015002175856008202325852000902407655001202416IND60727947220221120075310.0210524e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072794722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fbp.2021.02.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJin, Qing10aTechno-economic analysis of a grape pomace biorefinery: Production of seed oil, polyphenols, and biochar  ap. 139-151.  aProcessing grape pomace (GP), a major waste from the wine industry, into multiple value-added products based on the biorefinery concept has a potential to reduce waste disposal and promote a sustainable bioeconomy. However, its economic feasibility at a commercial scale remains unknown. The present study aims to evaluate the economics of a biorefinery process of GP, by performing comparative techno-economic analysis of three processing scenarios: (1) a whole biorefinery process that fully utilizes GP biomass and produces grape seed oil, polyphenols, and biochar (GSO+GSKP+GB), (2) a process that produces grape seed oil and polyphenols (GSO+GSKP), and (3) a process that produces only grape seed oil (GSO). A plant capacity of about 33,000 metric tons/year was considered in the analysis. Among the three scenarios, the whole biorefinery process (GSO+GSKP+GB) showed the highest economic performance with the net present value (NPV), internal rate of return (IRR), and payback period of 111.7 million US-$, 34.3%, and 2.5 years, respectively, due to the diverse revenues and minimized waste disposal cost. The GSO plant showed the lowest economic performance with a negative NPV. Sensitivity analysis revealed that plant capacity, polyphenol price, polyphenol concentration (percentage) in grape pomace, and biochar price had dominating influences on the economic performance of the biorefinery process.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiobased products 3abiochar 3abioeconomics 3abiomass 3abiorefining 3aeconomic feasibility 3aeconomic performance 3agrape pomace 3agrapeseed oil 3apolyphenols 3aprices 3avalue added 3awaste disposal 3awastes 3awine industry 0aTechno-economic analysis 0aGrape pomace 0aSeed oil 0aPolyphenol 0aBiochar1 aO’Keefe, Sean F.1 aStewart, Amanda C.1 aNeilson, Andrew P.1 aKim, Young-Teck1 aHuang, Haibo0 tFood and bioproducts processing.g2021 May, v. 127 p.139-151dElsevier B.V.aInstitution of Chemical EngineerswJournal:jnl47636x0960-30857nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fbp.2021.02.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02869naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245007800173300001600251520152200267592002801789650003701817650001901854650001401873650002301887650001701910650001101927650001901938650002901957650002101986650001202007650003302019650002002052650001802072650001602090653000902106653002902115653001102144653002102155653001802176700002002194773010202214856008602316852000902402655001202411IND60581064820221119103443.0171005e20160915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058106482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2016.07.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChung, Wei-Chieh10aDry reforming of methane by combined spark discharge with a ferroelectric  ap. 305-314.  aThe increasing anthropogenic emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs) is causing global warming which is a matter of deep public concern. Dry reforming of methane (DRM) is an attractive means of reducing the emission of GHGs, because it can convert CO2 and CH4 into syngas. Non-thermal plasma has been investigated for use in DRM and the results demonstrate that plasma can convert CO2 and CH4 into syngas at a lower temperature than catalysis, but the specific energy is relatively high. Combining a catalyst with non-thermal plasma in hybrid system can produce various synergistic effects that reduce specific energy. In this work, BaZr0.05Ti0.95O3 (BZT) with a perovskite structure and ferroelectric property is packed into the plasma reactor to form a hybrid system. The syngas generation efficiency of BZT with a spark discharge reactor is investigated. The spark discharge reactor yields 49.4% conversion of CO2 and 52.5% conversion of CH4 and the BZT packed bed reactor yields 79.0% conversion of CO2 and 84.2% conversion of CH4. With respect to energy utilization, the BZT packed bed reactor has an specific energy of 0.218MJ/mol, which is 18.7% lower than that of the spark discharge reactor without a ferroelectric (0.268MJ/mol). Characterization of BZT reveals that the presence of BZT increases the charge density in the plasma reactor, favoring CO2 and CH4 dissociation. Also, SEM and XPS results show that BZT is modified with plasma, resulting in a positive synergy between the plasma and the ferroelectric.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3acarbon dioxide 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3adissociation 3aenergy 3aglobal warming 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agreenhouse gases 3amethane 3ascanning electron microscopy 3aspecific energy 3asynthesis gas 3atemperature 0aCCUS 0aDry reforming of methane 0aSyngas 0aPlasma catalysis 0aFerroelectric1 aChang, Moo-Been0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2016 Sept. 15, v. 124 p.305-314dElsevier Ltdx0196-89047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2016.07.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02400naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245012300170520093900293592002801232650001201260650001401272650002301286650002301309650001701332650000901349650001301358650001901371650002001390650001101410650001701421650001901438653001201457653000801469653003401477653001501511653001801526700001201544700005401556700001701610700001501627700001801642700001601660700002101676773011401697856008601811852000901897655001201906IND60687356320221121062204.0200517e20200715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068735632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.1225362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGong, Zhiqiang10aInsights into modified red mud for the selective catalytic reduction of NOx: Activation mechanism of targeted leaching  aRed mud (RM) is a solid waste rich in iron oxide, which has the potential to be utilized as the catalyst for selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NOₓ. We pretreated the RM sample with the selective acid leaching method, after which 97.6 % of the alkali was neutralized, and only 8 % of the Fe₂O₃ were leached out. Once leached, the RM samples were activated for the SCR reaction. It showed NOₓ conversions above 90 % in 310–430 °C and exhibited high resistance to SO₂ and H₂O. After leaching, i. the SBET reached twice as before; ii. the sintering caused by alkali was eliminated; iii. the activated RM exhibited improved Fe³⁺/Fe²⁺ ratio and enhanced chemisorbed surface oxygen (Oα); iv. the oxygen mobility and the surface acidity were promoted. Overall, the selective acid leaching is an efficient method to activate RM for the SCR reaction. The RM based catalysts can be an alternative for SCR technology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidity 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3achemical reduction 3aferric oxide 3airon 3aleaching 3aneutralization 3anitrogen oxides 3aoxygen 3asolid wastes 3asulfur dioxide 0aRed mud 0aNOx 0aSelective catalytic reduction 0aIron oxide 0aAcid leaching1 aMa, Jun1 aWang, Dong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1132-91461 aNiu, Shengli1 aYan, Bohui1 aShi, Qinglong1 aLu, Chunmei1 aCrittenden, John0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2020 July 15, v. 394 p.122536-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.1225363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03336naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245013800172300001600310520195000326592002802276650001302304650002902317650001102346650001902357650001502376650002202391650000902413650001002422650001302432650001402445650001902459650000902478650001502487650001902502650001302521650001402534650001502548650001302563651001202576700002502588700001902613700002702632773010502659856008102764852000902845655001202854IND60575663020221121033452.0170728e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057566302DNAL7 a10.1007/s10933-017-9948-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEarley, Sean Michael10aLinking biogeochemical processes and historic primary producer communities in a SE USA sinkhole lake from the mid-Holocene to present  ap. 295-306.  aMany freshwater resources receive materials from human development causing a decrease in ecological services when compared to pre-disturbance periods. As a result, the understanding of eutrophication and limnological change has increased, but less attention has been given to systems under intense human impact that have not eutrophied so that drivers precluding eutrophication can be documented. The primary objective of this research was to reconstruct allochthonous inputs and in-lake processes for Long Pond, Georgia, USA from the mid Holocene to present and link them to primary producer community changes. Long Pond is a mesotrophic lake located in a highly altered watershed from agricultural and municipal land use and housing developments. A 5 m sediment core was collected from Long Pond, and organic matter, nutrients (C, N, P), metals (Al, Fe, Cu), and photosynthetic pigments were measured. Long Pond existed in three limnological states spanning the past ~6000 years. Prior to modern lacustrine conditions, Long Pond was a wetland/peat system that experienced the highest primary producer abundance recorded in the core. The modern lacustrine state began in the late Holocene and was characterized by increased connectivity with the surrounding watershed and low productivity. Human impacts began around 1900 AD and included high levels of phosphorus and metal deposition but moderate levels of primary producer abundance. As a result, in-lake dynamics are believed to be regulating the trophic status of Long Pond. Low concentrations of available phosphorus in the water column combined with high concentrations of sedimentary phosphorus may imply the binding of phosphorus to the sediments by certain materials such as aluminum and iron. Long Pond serves as an example of the complex in-lake processes that can occur from allochthonous inputs and autochthonous responses in lake systems thus complicating management decisions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3aanthropogenic activities 3acopper 3aeutrophication 3afreshwater 3ahuman development 3airon 3alakes 3aland use 3anutrients 3aorganic matter 3apeat 3aphosphorus 3aphotosynthesis 3apigments 3asediments 3awatersheds 3awetlands 3aGeorgia1 aWaters, Matthew Neal1 aThieme, Donald1 aSmoak, Joseph McDonald0 tJournal of paleolimnology.g2017 Apr., v. 57, no. 4 p.295-306dSpringer Netherlandsx0921-27287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-017-9948-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03210naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005900151245009000210500002200300520198800322592002802310650002402338650002902362650002902391650002602420650001502446650001202461651001002473653001802483653002402501653002702525653002202552700002002574700002802594700001802622773008902640856008602729852000902815655001202824IND60670396820221120081401.0191002e20190923xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067039682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2019.1057672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDondina, Olivia1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8097-197110aPractical insights to select focal species and design priority areas for conservation  aPre-press version  aThe focal species approach claims that a landscape managed for the conservation of a set of focal species, each of which identified as the most threatened by specific processes, also protects all the other species. We investigated the effects of two practical issues of this approach: the problems with identifying the species most affected by threatening processes, which often only target the most area-limited species, and the disregard for the different spatial scales at which processes affect different species. We focused on a fragmented landscape in Northern Italy and selected the most area-limited (Capreolus capreolus) and dispersal-limited (Muscardinus avellanarius) mammal species. We mapped and overlapped the suitable areas for the two species considering 2 suitability scenarios. We then evaluated whether the area-limited species was more effective as a surrogate for the dispersal-limited species, or the opposite held true (a surrogate is a species able to cover at least 50% of the area and the number of patches suitable for another species). Moreover, we evaluated if buffering the suitable areas for the two species with 4 buffer sizes affected their ability as surrogates. Neither the area-limited, nor the dispersal-limited species was found to be an effective surrogate for the other species because of the very different distribution patterns of their suitable areas. Conversely, when buffers around suitable areas were designed, the dispersal-limited species acted as a surrogate for the area-limited species in 7 out of 8 cases (2 suitability scenarios per 4 buffer sizes), while the area-limited species was a surrogate in only one case. Using area-limited species as focal species may thus be detrimental and lead to conservation plans unable to protect species for which the area is not the key factor affecting the distribution pattern. Conversely, when the suitable areas are buffered, dispersal-limited species could become effective focal species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCapreolus capreolus 3aMuscardinus avellanarius 3aenvironmental indicators 3ahabitat fragmentation 3alandscapes 3amammals 3aItaly 0aFragmentation 0aHabitat suitability 0aLandscape connectivity 0aSurrogate species1 aOrioli, Valerio1 aChiatante, Gianpasquale1 aBani, Luciano0 tEcological indicators.g2019 Sept. 23, dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2019.1057673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03553naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003600113040001800149100002600167245017400193300001600367520161300383592002801996650001102024650001002035650001202045650001302057650000902070650005502079650002402134650002502158650001802183650002802201650002802229650005502257650001102312650003202323650001502355650001102370650002002381650003602401650002802437650002302465650004602488650002602534650003902560653001002599653000802609653002202617653001502639653004002654653001002694700002702704700001902731700002302750773007502773856008202848852000902930655001202939IND60099087820221118230025.0161021e20130915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009908782DNAL7 a237276052pmid7 a10.1016/j.gene.2013.05.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlQattan, Mohammad M.12aA Report of Two cases of Al-Awadi Raas-Rothschild Syndrome (AARRS) supporting that “Apparent” Phocomelia differentiates AARRS from Schinzel Phocomelia Syndrome (SPS)  ap. 371-375.  aAlthough there is a long list of syndromes with phocomelia, there are only two syndromes in which there is concurrent pelvic dysplasia and phocomelia: Al-Awadi–Raas-Rothschild syndrome (AARRS) and Schinzel phocomelia syndrome (SPS). Currently, there is a diagnostic confusion between the two syndromes and both have the same MIM entry (MIM 276820). We believe that the two syndromes are different entities and we also believe that the limb defect in SPS is a “true” phocomelia while the limb defect in AARRS is an “apparent” phocomelia. “Apparent” phocomelia describes the most severe form of ulnar ray deficiency in which there is absent ulna with radio-humeral synostosis. “Apparent” phocomelia is diagnosed radiologically by three radiological features: the apparently single bone occupying the arm/forearm appears relatively long, the area of radio-humeral synostosis will have thicker cortex with or without slight angulation, and the lower end of the bone resembles the lower end of a radius and not a humerus. In this paper, we present two new cases of AARRS from two different Saudi Arabian tribes: one case with R292C mutation of WNT7A with bilateral “apparent” phocomelia and a second case with a novel c.814G>T mutation of the WNT7A gene (resulting in wnt7a protein truncation at position 272) with unilateral “apparent” phocomelia. We reviewed previously reported cases of AARRS and SPS to further delineate the differences between these two syndromes. We make the argument that these two syndromes are two different entities and hence require two different MIM entries.  aPublisher supplied data 3acortex 3agenes 3ahumerus 3amutation 3aulna 2aAmenorrheaxclassificationxgeneticsxradiography. 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aCase-Control Studies 2aConsanguinity 2aDNA Mutational Analysis 2aDiagnosis, Differential 2aEctromeliaxclassificationxgeneticsxradiography. 2aFemale 2aGenetic Association Studies 2aHomozygote 2aHumans 2aInfant, Newborn 2aMolecular Diagnostic Techniques 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutation, Missense 2aPelvic Bonesxabnormalitiesxradiography. 2aUterusxabnormalities 2aWnt Proteinsxchemistryxgenetics. 0aAARRS 0aPCR 0aFuhrmann syndrome 0aPhocomelia 0aAl-Awadi–Raas-Rothschild syndrome 0awnt7a1 aAlAbdulkareem, Ibrahim1 aBallow, Mariam1 aAl Balwi, Mohammed0 tGene.g2013 Sept. 15, v. 527 p.371-375dElsevier B.V.x0378-11197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2013.05.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02499naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002100153245009500174300001600269520108200285592002801367650002901395650002901424650001301453650002301466650001201489650002001501650001401521650002201535650001201557650002301569650001901592650001401611650001701625650001601642650001001658650001101668650001101679700003001690700002801720700002201748700002301770700002201793773010601815856008701921852000902008655001202017IND60087687620221120184222.0141102e20130205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008768762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enzmictec.2012.11.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPassoth, Volkmar10aEnhanced ethanol production from wheat straw by integrated storage and pre-treatment (ISP)  ap. 105-110.  aIntegrated storage and pre-treatment (ISP) combines biopreservation of moist material under airtight conditions and pre-treatment. Moist wheat straw was inoculated with the biocontrol yeast Wickerhamomyces anomalus, the xylan degrading yeast Scheffersomyces stipitis or a co-culture of both. The samples and non-inoculated controls were stored at 4 or 15°C. The non-inoculated controls were heavily contaminated with moulds, in contrast to the samples inoculated with W. anomalus or S. stipitis. These two yeasts were able to grow on wheat straw as sole source of nutrients. When ethanol was produced from moist wheat straw stored for four weeks at 4°C with S. stipitis, an up to 40% enhanced yield (final yield 0.15g ethanol per g straw dry weight) was obtained compared to a dry sample (0.107g/g). In all other moist samples, stored for four weeks at 4°C or 15°C, 6–35% higher yields were obtained. Thus, energy efficient bio-preservation can improve the pre-treatment efficiency for lignocellulose biomass, which is a critical bottleneck in its conversion to biofuels.  aPublisher supplied data 3aScheffersomyces stipitis 3aWickerhamomyces anomalus 3abiofuels 3abiological control 3abiomass 3abiopreservation 3acoculture 3aenergy efficiency 3aethanol 3aethanol production 3alignocellulose 3anutrients 3apretreatment 3awheat straw 3axylan 3ayeasts 3ayields1 aTabassum, Muhammad Rizwan1 aNair, Harikrishnan A.S.1 aOlstorpe, Matilda1 aTiukova, Ievgeniia1 aStåhlberg, Jerry0 tEnzyme and microbial technology.g2013 Feb. 5, v. 52, no. 2 p.105-110dElsevier Inc.x0141-02297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enzmictec.2012.11.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03475naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245015800172300001600330520195500346592002802301650001102329650003402340650001602374650002902390650001402419650002302433650003002456650003102486650001202517650003302529650001402562650001102576650001002587650001602597650001402613650001002627650001302637650001002650650001002660650000902670650001202679650001402691651001702705700001902722700001902741773010702760856008102867852000902948655001202957IND60083220020221118162012.0141101e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008322002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jip.2011.07.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMalan, Antoinette P.10aIsolation and identification of entomopathogenic nematodes from citrus orchards in South Africa and their biocontrol potential against false codling moth  ap. 115-125.  aA survey was conducted to determine the diversity and frequency of endemic entomopathogenic nematodes (EPN) in citrus orchards in the Western Cape, Eastern Cape and Mpumalanga provinces of South Africa. The main aim of the survey was to obtain nematodes as biological control agents against false codling moth (FCM), Thaumatotibia leucotreta, a key pest of citrus in South Africa. From a total of 202 samples, 35 (17%) tested positive for the presence of EPN. Of these, four isolates (11%) were found to be steinernematids, while 31 (89%) were heterorhabditids. Sequencing and characterisation of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region was used to identify all nematode isolates to species level. Morphometrics, morphology and biology of the infective juvenile (IJ) and the first-generation male were used to support molecular identification and characterisation. The Steinernema spp. identified were Steinernema khoisanae, Steinernema yirgalemense and Steinernema citrae. This is the first report of S. yirgalemense in South Africa, while for S. citrae it is the second new steinernematid to be identified from South Africa. Heterorhabditis species identified include Heterorhabditis bacteriophora, Heterorhabditis zealandica and an unknown species of Heterorhabditis. Laboratory bioassays, using 24-well bioassay disks, have shown isolates of all six species found during the survey, to be highly virulent against the last instar of FCM larvae. S. yirgalemense, at a concentration of 50IJs/FCM larva caused 100% mortality and 74% at a concentration of 200IJs/pupa. Using a sand bioassay, S. yirgalemense gave 93% control of cocooned pupae and emerging moths at a concentration of 20IJs/cm². This is the first report on the potential use of EPN to control the soil-borne life stages of FCM, which includes larvae, pupae and emerging moths. It was shown that emerging moths were infected with nematodes, which may aid in control and dispersal.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCitrus 3aHeterorhabditis bacteriophora 3aSteinernema 3aThaumatotibia leucotreta 3abioassays 3abiological control 3abiological control agents 3aentomopathogenic nematodes 3ainstars 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3ajuveniles 3alarvae 3amales 3amorphometry 3amortality 3amoths 3aorchards 3apests 3apupae 3asand 3asurveys 3avirulence 3aSouth Africa1 aKnoetze, Rinus1 aMoore, Sean D.0 tJournal of invertebrate pathology.g2011 Oct., v. 108, no. 2 p.115-125dElsevier Inc.x0022-20117nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jip.2011.07.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03059naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005900151245014500210520144600355592002801801650002201829650002001851650001301871650002601884650001101910650001301921650001001934650001601944650001401960653002801974653002302002653001902025653002802044653001502072700002302087700002502110700005702135700002702192700002302219700002302242700002102265700002202286700002102308700002702329773011402356856008602470852000902556655001202565IND60734879520221122044941.0211106e20210815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073487952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.1258902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeloire, Maëva1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6460-589910aStability and radioactive gaseous iodine-131 retention capacity of binderless UiO-66-NH2 granules under severe nuclear accidental conditions  aIn the present work, we aim to investigate the ability of the zirconium-based MOF-type compound UiO-66-NH₂, to immobilize molecular gaseous iodine under conditions analogous to those encountered in an operating Filtered Containment Venting System (FCVS) line. Typically, the UiO-66-NH₂ particles were exposed to ¹³¹I (beta and gamma emitters) and submitted to air/steam at 120 °C, under gamma irradiation (1.9 kGy h⁻¹). In parallel to this experiment under simulated accidental conditions, the stability of the binderless UiO-66-NH₂ granules under steam and gamma irradiation was investigated. In order to fit with the specifications required by typical venting systems, and to compare the efficiency of the selected MOF to porous materials commonly used by the industry, scale-up syntheses and UiO-66-NH₂ millimetric-size shaping were realized. For this task, we developed an original binderless method, in order to analyze solely the efficiency of the UiO-66-NH₂ material. The shaped MOF particles were then submitted separately to gamma irradiation, steam and temperature, for confirming their viability in a venting process. Their structural, textural and mechanical behaviors were characterized by the means several techniques including gas sorption, powder X-ray diffraction, infrared spectroscopy and crushing tests. Promising results were obtained to trap gaseous molecular iodine in severe accidental conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3agamma radiation 3aindustry 3ainfrared spectroscopy 3aiodine 3asorption 3asteam 3atemperature 3aviability 0aNuclear severe accident 0aGaseous iodine-131 0aImmobilization 0aMetal-Organic Framework 0aUiO-66-NH21 aDhainaut, Jérémy1 aDevaux, Philippe F.,1 aLeroy, Olivia1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7379-16061 aDesjonqueres, Hortense1 aPoirier, Stéphane1 aNerisson, Philippe1 aCantrel, Laurent1 aRoyer, Sébastien1 aLoiseau, Thierry1 aVolkringer, Christophe0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2021 Aug. 15, v. 416 p.125890-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.1258903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04190naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245013500169520221200304592002802516650001502544650002802559650001702587650001702604650001502621650001602636650002102652650001402673650001902687650001602706650001602722650001502738650000802753650001702761650001702778650002102795650002902816650004402845650001002889650001002899650001602909651001202925651001902937651001102956651001602967651001102983653001502994653001303009653000903022653001103031653001503042700002103057700001803078700002003096700001903116700002303135700002203158700002103180700001603201700002103217700002203238700002103260773010503281856008503386852000903471655001203480IND60683537020221119201803.0200318e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068353702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envint.2020.1055392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDe Ruyck, Karl10aMycotoxin exposure assessments in a multi-center European validation study by 24-hour dietary recall and biological fluid sampling  aThe European Food Consumption Validation (EFCOVAL) project includes 600 men and women from Belgium, the Czech Republic, France, the Netherlands, and Norway, who had given serum and 24-hour urine samples, and completed 24-hour dietary recall (24-HDR) interviews. Consumption, according to 24-HDR, was matched against the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) databases of mycotoxin contaminations, via the FoodEx1 standard classifications, producing an indirect external estimate of dietary mycotoxin exposure. Direct, internal measurements of dietary mycotoxin exposure were made in serum and urine by ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. For the first time, mycotoxin exposures were thoroughly compared between two 24-HDRs, and two 24-hour urine samples collected during the same days covered by the 24-HDRs. These measurements were compared to a single-time point serum measurement to investigate evidence of chronic mycotoxin exposure. According to 24-HDR data, all 600 individuals were exposed to between 4 and 34 mycotoxins, whereof 10 found to exceed the tolerable daily intake. Correlations were observed between two time points, and significant correlations were observed between concentrations in serum and urine. However, only acetyldeoxynivalenol, ochratoxin A, and sterigmatocystin were found to have significant positive correlations between 24-HDR exposures and serum, while aflatoxin G1 and G2, HT-2 toxin, and deoxynivalenol were associated between concurrent 24-HDR and 24-hour urine. Substantial agreements on quantitative levels between serum and urine were observed for the groups Type B Trichothecenes and Zearalenone. Further research is required to bridge the interpretation of external and internal exposure estimates of the individual on a time scale of hours. Additionally, metabolomic profiling of dietary mycotoxin exposures could help with a comprehensive assessment of single time-point exposures, but also with the identification of chronic exposure biomarkers. Such detailed characterization informs population exposure assessments, and aids in the interpretation of epidemiological health outcomes related to multi-mycotoxin exposure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHT-2 toxin 3aacceptable daily intake 3aaflatoxin G1 3aaflatoxin G2 3abiomarkers 3ablood serum 3achronic exposure 3adatabases 3adeoxynivalenol 3adiet recall 3afood safety 3ainterviews 3amen 3ametabolomics 3aochratoxin A 3asterigmatocystin 3atandem mass spectrometry 3aultra-performance liquid chromatography 3aurine 3awomen 3azearalenone 3aBelgium 3aCzech Republic 3aFrance 3aNetherlands 3aNorway 0aMycotoxins 0aExposure 0aRisk 0aEurope 0aAflatoxins1 aHuybrechts, Inge1 aYang, Shupeng1 aArcella, Davide1 aClaeys, Liesel1 aAbbeddou, Souheila1 aDe Keyzer, Willem1 aDe Vries, Jeanne1 aOcke, Marga1 aRuprich, Jiří,1 aDe Boevre, Marthe1 aDe Saeger, Sarah0 tEnvironment international.g2020 Apr., v. 137 p.105539-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6374x0160-41207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2020.1055393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02994naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002000153245018000173300001600353520140800369592002801777650002301805650001301828650002601841650002901867650001801896650001701914650001401931650001501945650001501960650001201975650002501987650002302012650001602035650001502051650003302066650001102099650001102110650002402121650001602145700001502161700001702176700002002193700002402213700001802237700001902255773010602274856008702380852000902467655001202476IND60087687820221120184333.0141102e20130205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008768782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enzmictec.2012.11.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdachi, Daisuke13aAn integrative process model of enzymatic biodiesel production through ethanol fermentation of brown rice followed by lipase-catalyzed ethanolysis in a water-containing system  ap. 118-122.  aWe attempted to integrate lipase-catalyzed ethanolysis into fermentative bioethanol production. To produce bioethanol, ethanol fermentation from brown rice was conducted using a tetraploid Saccharomyces cerevisiae expressing α-amylase and glucoamylase. The resultant ethanol was distilled and separated into three fractions with different concentrations of water and fusel alcohols. In ethanolysis using the first fraction with 89.3% ethanol, a recombinant Aspergillus oryzae whole-cell biocatalyst expressing Fusarium heterosporum lipase (r-FHL) afforded the highest ethyl ester content of 94.0% after 96h. Owing to a high concentration of water in the bioethanol solutions, r-FHL, which works best in the presence of water when processing ethanolysis, was found to be more suitable for the integrative process than a commercial immobilized Candida antarctica lipase. In addition, r-FHL was used for repeated-batch ethanolysis, resulting in an ethyl ester content of more than 80% even after the fifth batch. Fusel alcohols such as 1-butanol and isobutyl alcohol are thought to decrease the lipase activity of r-FHL. Using this process, a high ethyl ester content was obtained by simply mixing bioethanol, plant oil, and lipase with an appropriate adjustment of water concentration. The developed process model, therefore, would contribute to biodiesel production from only biomass-derived feedstocks.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus oryzae 3aFusarium 3aPseudozyma antarctica 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aalpha-amylase 3abiocatalysts 3abiodiesel 3abioethanol 3abrown rice 3aethanol 3aethanol fermentation 3aethanol production 3aethanolysis 3afeedstocks 3aglucan 1,4-alpha-glucosidase 3amixing 3amodels 3aplant fats and oils 3atetraploidy1 aKoda, Risa1 aHama, Shinji1 aYamada, Ryosuke1 aNakashima, Kazunori1 aOgino, Chiaki1 aKondo, Akihiko0 tEnzyme and microbial technology.g2013 Feb. 5, v. 52, no. 2 p.118-122dElsevier Inc.x0141-02297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enzmictec.2012.11.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03134naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245015200165300001600317520149500333592002801828650001501856650002001871650001401891650001801905650002101923650001401944650001401958650001501972650001901987650001002006650001302016650001502029650001702044650001102061650001402072650003702086650001002123653004002133653004602173653004402219653001002263653001602273653001502289700001302304700001402317700001602331700001802347700001702365773010402382856008502486852000902571655001202580IND60626405620221120045151.0200117e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062640562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2018.12.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZeng, Yuan10aIn vitro oral and inhalation bioaccessibility of hydrophobic organic contaminants (HOCs) in airborne particles and influence of relevant parameters  ap. 134-140.  aThe bioaccessibility of environmental contaminants has been assessed widely using in vitro simulation; however, the physiological parameters used vary greatly. In this study, we assessed the influence of various physiological parameters and food material on the oral or inhalation bioaccessibility of PM₂.₅-bound hydrophobic organic contaminants (HOCs), including halogenated flame retardants (HFRs), organophosphorus flame retardants (OPFRs), and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). The results showed that physiologically based pepsin and pancreatin have a small influence on the HOC liberation from particles. The bioaccessibility increased dramatically when the bile salt concentrations exceeding the critical micelle concentration, and application of porcine bile salts probably lead to underestimated bioaccessibility. Protein and carbohydrates significantly increased the bioaccessibility of most HOCs, while a significant bioaccessibility reduction was caused by green tea. The bioaccessibility of most HOCs was not promoted by liquor under normal physiological condition, but was significantly promoted under fast condition. Long residence time of PM₂.₅ in the lung (15 days) would result in higher mobilization of PAHs into the lung fluid than short time (one day). However, the inverse time-dependence for OPFRs suggests degradation in the lung fluid. A mechanism of hydrolysis of organophosphorus ester is hypothesized, and the half lives ranged from 17 to 90 days.  aPublisher supplied data 3abile salts 3abioavailability 3abreathing 3acarbohydrates 3aflame retardants 3agreen tea 3ahalf life 3ahydrolysis 3ahydrophobicity 3alungs 3amicelles 3apancreatin 3aparticulates 3apepsin 3apollution 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3aswine 0aHalogenated flame retardants (HFRs) 0aOrganophosphorus flame retardants (OPFRs) 0aPolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) 0aPM2.5 0aLung fluids 0aHydrolysis1 aFan, Yun1 aYan, Xiao1 aZheng, Jing1 aChen, She-Jun1 aMai, Bi-Xian0 tEnvironmental research.g2019 Mar., v. 170 p.134-140dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12442x0013-93517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2018.12.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02508naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005800153245012400211300001800335520134700353592002801700650002201728650000801750650001301758650000901771650001401780650000901794650001001803650001401813650001401827650001501841650001601856700005901872773011901931856008702050852000902137655001202146IND60647692620221121163730.0190620e20190430xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064769262DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.9b004212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Lingfeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5505-917910aFeasibility of Using the Frank–Kamenetskii Theory To Predict the Spontaneous Ignition of the Crude Oil–Sand Mixture  ap. 4816-4825.  aLight crude oil usually has more saturate-type components, which have much lower activation energy than the other components. In a lower temperature range, light crude oil will generate more enthalpy than heavy crude oil. The heat generated by the low-temperature oxidation of light crude oil may promote the oxidation process to a high-temperature oxidation range. Thus, light oil has more potential to achieve spontaneous ignition than heavy crude oil. This paper studies the feasibility of using the Frank–Kamenetskii theory to predict the spontaneous ignition of light crude oil. Oven experiments can directly show whether a certain oil can achieve spontaneous ignition under certain conditions. If the Frank–Kamenetskii theory is able to predict the spontaneous ignition of crude oil, petroleum engineers could much more easily design a proper process for air injection process (AIP) projects. This paper will first review the theory of Semenov and Frank–Kamenetskii. Then, the oven test results will be compared to Frank–Kamenetskii theoretical predictions. Finally, conclusions will be drawn on the feasibility of applying the Frank–Kamenetskii theory to study the spontaneous ignition of crude oil. The Frank–Kamenetskii theory is found to be not feasible to predict the spontaneous ignition of a crude oil–sand mixture.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivation energy 3aair 3aenthalpy 3aheat 3aoil sands 3aoils 3aovens 3aoxidation 3apetroleum 3aprediction 3atemperature1 aSheng, James J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1778-14860 tEnergy & fuels.g2019 Apr. 30, v. 33, no. 6 p.4816-4825dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.9b004213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02824naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245012300167300001500290520147900305592002801784650001801812650001801830650001501848650001901863650001701882650001301899650001401912650002501926653001501951653000901966653000901975700001501984700001301999700001702012700001602029700001502045700001902060700001302079700001202092700001502104700001302119700001602132773010002148856008502248852000902333655001202342IND60683537220221119201645.0200221e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068353722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molimm.2020.01.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShi, Lianjie10aCD70-mediated CD27 expression downregulation contributed to the regulatory B10 cell impairment in rheumatoid arthritis  ap. 92-100.  aRegulatory B10 cells have been shown to exhibit impaired functions in autoimmune diseases. However, the underlying mechanism is still obscure. In the present study, we aimed to understand the regulatory characteristics of regulatory B10 cells and how these cells are involved in the development of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Here, we chose CD19⁺CD24ʰⁱCD27⁺ as the phenotype of regulatory B10 cells. We found that the frequencies of CD19⁺CD24ʰⁱCD27⁺ regulatory B10 cells were decreased and that their IL-10-producing function was impaired in patients with RA compared with healthy controls (HCs). The impairment in CD19⁺CD24ʰⁱCD27⁺ B10 cells was partially attributed to the decreased expression of CD27 induced by the upregulated CD70 expression on CD19 + B cells and CD4 + T cells. The proportion of CD19⁺CD24ʰⁱCD27⁺ regulatory B10 cells could be restored by blocking the CD70-CD27 interaction with an anti-CD70 antibody. Furthermore, the CD70-CD27 interaction significantly elevated IL-10 expression and might compensate for the decreased number of CD19⁺CD24ʰⁱCD27⁺ B cells. Hence, the CD70-CD27 interaction might play a critical role in the numerical and functional impairments of regulatory B10 cells, thus contributing to RA pathogenesis. In conclusion, the change in CD19⁺CD24ʰⁱCD27⁺ regulatory B10 cells in RA was only a consequence, not the cause, of RA development, but the increased expression of CD70 might be the culprit.  aPublisher supplied data 3aB-lymphocytes 3aT-lymphocytes 3aantibodies 3ainterleukin-10 3apathogenesis 3apatients 3aphenotype 3arheumatoid arthritis 0aRegulatory 0aCD70 0aCD271 aHu, Fanlei1 aZhu, Lei1 aXu, Chuanhui1 aZhu, Huaqun1 aLi, Yingni1 aLiu, Hongjiang1 aLi, Chun1 aLiu, Na1 aXu, Liling1 aMu, Rong1 aLi, Zhanguo0 tMolecular immunology.g2020 Mar., v. 119 p.92-100dElsevier LtdwJournal:12510x0161-58907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molimm.2020.01.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02175naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001600155245011800171300001600289520102000305592002801325650002101353650002201374650002201396650002501418653002201443653003401465653002701499653002301526700001301549700001401562700001701576700001701593700001701610773007601627856008901703852000901792655001201801IND60531509720221119174202.0160723e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053150972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2016.02.0352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Qilin10aEnhancing post aerobic digestion of full-scale anaerobically digested sludge using free nitrous acid pretreatment  ap. 152-158.  aPost aerobic digestion of anaerobically digested sludge (ADS) has been extensively applied to the wastewater treatment plants to enhance sludge reduction. However, the degradation of ADS in the post aerobic digester itself is still limited. In this work, an innovative free nitrous acid (HNO2 or FNA)-based pretreatment approach is proposed to improve full-scale ADS degradation in post aerobic digester. The post aerobic digestion was conducted by using an activated sludge to aerobically digest ADS for 4 days. Degradations of the FNA-treated (treated at 1.0 and 2.0 mg N/L for 24 h) and untreated ADSs were then determined and compared. The ADS was degraded by 26% and 32%, respectively, in the 4-day post aerobic digestion period while being pretreated at 1.0 and 2.0 mg HNO2–N/L. In comparison, only 20% of the untreated ADS was degraded. Economic analysis demonstrated that the implementation of FNA pretreatment can be economically favourable or not depending on the sludge transport and disposal cost.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated sludge 3aaerobic digestion 3aeconomic analysis 3awastewater treatment 0aFree nitrous acid 0aAnaerobically digested sludge 0aPost aerobic digestion 0aSludge degradation1 aZhou, Xu1 aPeng, Lai1 aWang, Dongbo1 aXie, Guo-Jun1 aYuan, Zhiguo0 tChemosphere.g2016 May, v. 150 p.152-158dElsevier Ltdx0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2016.02.0353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02875naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245009500168300001400263520130100277592002801578650002201606650002501628650001201653650001201665650001301677650001801690650001701708650001701725650001601742650002201758650001901780650001601799650002501815653002301840653003701863653005101900653003101951700001501982700001301997700001902010700001702029700001202046700002002058700002102078700001702099700002502116773011002141856008502251852000902336655001202345IND60567210620221121205051.0181102e20170801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056721062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.memsci.2017.04.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Jun-Wei10aPorous β-Sialon planar membrane with a robust polymer-derived hydrophobic ceramic surface  ap. 63-69.  aA novel method of fabricating an all-ceramic hydrophobic membrane is proposed. First, porous β-Sialon planar ceramic membrane was prepared by a phase inversion and sintering method. Then, the β-Sialon ceramic membrane was coated with a uniform polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) layer through a poly-condensation reaction. Finally, through post-heat treatment in N2 atmosphere, the polymer layer was transformed into a tough hydrophobic vesicular ceramic layer with strong covalent Si-O and Si-N skeleton and Si-CH3 terminal groups in the surface. High contact angles were measured between the water and the modified hydrophobic membrane, ~140°, attributed to the presence of terminal Si-CH3 groups, which were derived from the polymer, and the micro- and nano-hierarchical lotus leaf-like structure of the surface. The high hydrophobicity was perfectly maintained after a 24h exposure of the produced membranes to humic acid, boiling water, aqueous solution of HCl, and benzene. Membrane distillation water desalination tests were also conducted. A water flux of 14.08l/m²h was obtained at 90°C, while the rejection rate was over 99% over the duration of the test that lasted for more than 70h, which supports that the produced membrane had excellent long-term stability and good recovery ability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaqueous solutions 3aartificial membranes 3abenzene 3aboiling 3aceramics 3acontact angle 3adesalination 3adistillation 3ahumic acids 3ahydrochloric acid 3ahydrophobicity 3amethodology 3apolydimethylsiloxane 0aβ-Sialon membrane 0aPolymer-derived ceramic modifier 0aHierarchical lotus leaf-like surface structure 0aRobust hydrophobic surface1 aLi, Xi-Zhe1 aFan, Min1 aGu, Jian-Qiang1 aHao, Lu-Yuan1 aXu, Xin1 aChen, Chu-Sheng1 aWang, Zhengming,1 aHao, You-Zhi1 aAgathopoulos, Simeon0 tJournal of membrane science.g2017 Aug. 01, v. 535 p.63-69dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12468x0376-73887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2017.04.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03214naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100002600191245011100217300001600328506007600344520163900420592002802059506003702087650001302124650001302137650002502150650001102175650002502186650002602211650001202237650002002249650001302269650001702282650001502299653002502314653002102339653001402360653001302374653002502387700001802412700001302430700001602443700002202459700001702481773010402498856008502602852000902687655001202696IND60626405920221207133203.0200117e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062640592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2018.12.0272doi7 aPMC64107392pmcid7 a306238812pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhachatoorian, Careen10aIdentification and quantification of electronic cigarette exhaled aerosol residue chemicals in field sites  ap. 351-358.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aElectronic cigarette (EC) users may exhale large clouds of aerosol that can settle on indoor surfaces forming ECEAR (EC exhaled aerosol residue). Little is known about the chemical composition or buildup of this residue.Our objective was to identify and quantify ECEAR chemicals in two field sites: an EC user's living room and a multi-user EC vape shop.We examined the buildup of ECEAR in commonly used materials (cotton, polyester, or terrycloth towel) placed inside the field sites. Materials were subjected to different lengths of exposure. Nicotine, nicotine alkaloids, and tobacco-specific nitrosamines (TSNAs) were identified and quantified in unexposed controls and field site samples using analytical chemical techniques.Nicotine and nicotine alkaloids were detected in materials inside the EC user's living room. Concentrations of ECEAR chemicals remained relatively constant over the first 5 months, suggesting some removal of the chemicals by air flow in the room approximating a steady state. ECEAR chemicals were detected in materials inside the vape shop after 6 h of exposure and levels continually increased over a month. By 1 month, the nicotine in the vape shop was 60 times higher than in the EC user's living room. ECEAR chemical concentrations varied in different locations in the vape shop. Control fabrics had either no detectable or very low concentrations of chemicals.In both field sites, chemicals from exhaled EC aerosols were deposited on indoor surfaces and accumulated over time forming ECEAR. Non-smokers, EC users, and employees of vape shops should be aware of this potential environmental hazard.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aaerosols 3aair flow 3achemical composition 3acotton 3aelectronic equipment 3aenvironmental hazards 3afabrics 3ahuman resources 3anicotine 3anitrosamines 3apolyesters 0aElectronic cigarette 0aPassive exposure 0aVape shop 0aNicotine 0aEnvironmental hazard1 aJacob, Peyton1 aSen, Amy1 aZhu, Yifang1 aBenowitz, Neal L.1 aTalbot, Prue0 tEnvironmental research.g2019 Mar., v. 170 p.351-358dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12442x0013-93517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2018.12.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02795naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001800142245005500160300002000215520152100235592002801756650001301784650001901797650001301816650001501829650001401844650001101858700001901869700001501888700002701903700001901930700005801949700005302007700005902060700005602119773014902175856007602324852000902400655001202409IND60667772920221118050058.0190919e20190825xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066777292DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.9b077852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Zuochen10aActive Patchy Colloids with Shape-Tunable Dynamics  ap. 14853-14863.  aControlling the complex dynamics of active colloids—the autonomous locomotion of colloidal particles and their spontaneous assembly—is challenging yet crucial for creating functional, out-of-equilibrium colloidal systems potentially useful for nano- and micromachines. Herein, by introducing the synthesis of active “patchy” colloids of various low-symmetry shapes, we demonstrate that the dynamics of such systems can be precisely tuned. The low-symmetry patchy colloids are made in bulk via a cluster-encapsulation-dewetting method. They carry essential information encoded in their shapes (particle geometry, number, size, and configurations of surface patches, etc.) that programs their locomotive and assembling behaviors. Under AC electric field, we show that the velocity of particle propulsion and the ability to brake and steer can be modulated by having two asymmetrical patches with various bending angles. The assembly of monopatch particles leads to the formation of dynamic and reconfigurable structures such as spinners and “cooperative swimmers” depending on the particle’s aspect ratios. A particle with two patches of different sizes allows for “directional bonding”, a concept popular in static assemblies but rare in dynamic ones. With the capability to make tunable and complex shapes, we anticipate the discovery of a diverse range of new dynamics and structures when other external stimuli (e.g., magnetic, optical, chemical, etc.) are employed and spark synergy with shapes.  aPublisher supplied data 3acolloids 3aelectric field 3ageometry 3alocomotion 3amagnetism 3asteers1 aWang, Zhisheng1 aLi, Jiahui1 aCheung, Simon Tsz Hang1 aTian, Changhao1 aKim, Shin-Hyun1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4095-57791 aYi, Gi-Ra1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1353-89881 aDucrot, Etienne1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8737-86681 aWang, Yufeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9409-72500 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2019 Aug. 25, v. 141, no. 37 p.14853-14863dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.9b077853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03065naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245013000170300001400300520165100314592002801965650001301993650002502006650001302031650001702044650001502061650002702076650001302103650001702116650002402133650002602157650001702183650001502200653004002215653002002255653001902275653000802294653001802302700001502320700001902335700001702354700002002371773011002391856008502501852000902586655001202595IND60567210820221121205036.0180830e20170715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056721082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.memsci.2017.04.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Qing-Lin10aElectrospun ultrafine fibrous PTFE-supported ZnO porous membrane with self-cleaning function for vacuum membrane distillation  ap. 73-82.  aIn this work, novel photocatalytic porous membranes consisting of ZnO supported by a poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE) substrate were fabricated by sintering electrospun PTFE/poly(vinylalcohol) (PVA)/zinc acetate dehydrate composite membranes after removal of the PVA carrier. The rheological properties of spinning solution were investigated. Results showed that the spinning solution exhibited good electrospinning performance and the membranes exhibited excellent flexibility, high chemical stability, and a highly specific surface area. The photocatalyst-ZnO particles derived from the thermal decomposition of zinc acetate dehydrate were homogeneously immobilized on the surface of ultrafine PTFE fibers to avoid the influence of agglomeration and sedimentation when ZnO particles were added directly. The performances of PTFE/ZnO membranes were investigated in vacuum membrane distillation (VMD) with photo-degradation experiments. Results indicated that appropriate PTFE/ZnO membranes could be an effective way for salt rejection and dye removal at the same time. In the VMD with photo-degradation experiments, the salt rejection was up to 99.70% and the dye removal rate of feed solution was up to 45% after 10-h operating time. Meanwhile, the PTFE/ZnO membranes also showed good self-cleaning ability. The fouled membranes could be cleaned after the 3-h UV irradiation with a permeate flux recovery rate of more than 94% after UV irradiation cleaning for 3-h. The immobilization of ZnO on substrate of ultrafine fibrous PTFE porous membranes may provide a wide range of potential applications for the treatment of dye-containing effluent.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetates 3aasymmetric membranes 3acleaning 3adistillation 3aphotolysis 3arheological properties 3aspinning 3asurface area 3athermal degradation 3aultraviolet radiation 3azinc acetate 3azinc oxide 0aPTFE/ZnO ultrafine fibrous membrane 0aElectrospinning 0aPhotocatalysis 0aVMD 0aSelf-cleaning1 aHuang, Yan1 aXiao, Chang-Fa1 aYou, Yan-Wei1 aZhang, Chao-Xin0 tJournal of membrane science.g2017 July 15, v. 534 p.73-82dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12468x0376-73887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2017.04.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03154naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154100002600163245010600189300001600295500012000311500002400431500002400455500001500479520120900494650002301703650003001726650002301756650001501779650002301794650002201817650002301839650001101862650002201873650001401895650001801909650001301927650001501940650002501955650001401980650002301994650002502017651001202042653002302054653003502077653004302112653002802155653002002183700002802203700002802231773011602259852000902375856008502384930003302469945002502502946001302527655001202540IND4435399720221118113046.0100416e201003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443539972DNAL7 a10.1637/8746-032709-Reg.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL833 0aP0501 aHandberg, Kurt Jensen10aGenetic Analysis of Avian Influenza Virus from Wild Birds and Mallards Reared for Shooting in Denmark  ap. 420-425.  aPaper presented at the 7th International Symposium on Avian Influenza, held on April 5-8, 2009, in Athens, Georgia.  aIncludes references  aSummary in Spanish.  a2019-12-06  aDenmark forms a geographical bottleneck along the migration route of many water birds breeding from northeastern Canada to north Siberia that gather to winter in Europe and Africa. Potentially, the concentration of such large numbers of water birds enhances the risk of avian influenza virus (AIV) introduction to domestic poultry. In 2003, Denmark initiated a nationwide survey of AIV in wild birds and mallards reared for shooting. Partial sequence analysis of the six internal genes from a total of 12 low pathogenic (LP) AIV isolates obtained in 2003 showed that genes from these viruses were closely related with genes from AIV circulating in northern Europe. For the Danish sequences only the PB2 and NS genes differ, so they cluster to more than one cluster in the phylogenetic trees. In spring 2006, highly pathogenic (HP) AIV H5N1 was detected in 44 cases of wild birds in Denmark. Sequence analysis of the HP H5N1 virus genome showed that it was not related to the LPAIV isolated previously, but closely related to the HPAIV H5 (Asian type) detected in the rest of Europe at that time. Even though only partial sequences were applied, this gave the idea for future full-length sequence studies. 3aAnas platyrhynchos 3ageographical distribution 3avertebrate viruses 3agame birds 3adisease reservoirs 3asequence analysis 3amigratory behavior 3agenome 3aInfluenza A virus 3aphylogeny 3apathogenicity 3agenotype 3awild birds 3anucleotide sequences 3awaterfowl 3amicrobial genetics 3adisease surveillance 3aDenmark 0amigration behavior 0alow pathogenic avian influenza 0ahighly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 0amolecular sequence data 0adisease control1 aTherkildsen, Ole Roland1 aJørgensen, Poul Henrik0 tAvian diseases.g2010 Mar., v. 54, no. 1 p.420-425dAmerican Association of Avian Pathologistsx0005-20867nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1637/8746-032709-Reg.13Available from publisher's Web site  a20100807b20100903c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/07/13  aOther US 7aarticle02636naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245007300162300002000235520143400255592002801689596005901717596005901776650002501835650001001860650001101870650001201881650001101893650001401904650001301918650002601931650001701957700005301974773015502027856008302182852000902265655001202274IND60780181920221117042250.0220616e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078018192DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-022-18776-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Ming10aStudy on the effect of income perception on cleaner-production fraud  ap. 44638-44652.  aWe investigated a single-cycle product supply chain in a game model, where a supplier is the leader. By innovatively introducing cleaner production fraudulent income perception factor into a game model, we studied the mechanism of the effect of enterprise social responsibility and environmental awareness on cleaner production fraud. The results showed that the income of retailers and suppliers changes under different perceptions of fraudulent income. That is, the value of cleaner production fraudulent income perception factor will affect the enterprise’s choice of differentiation strategy. When the enterprise’s sense of social responsibility is weak, it is more likely to choose cleaner production fraud. Conversely, under the constraints of high social responsibility, it more likely avoids production fraud. Regarding government supervision, the income of suppliers and retailers changes under different government penalties. Furthermore, a reasonable punishment for cleaner production fraud can reduce such violations. However, after the punishment reaches a level, the efficiency of supervision begins to decline. In views of that, improving enterprise social responsibility through institutional reform is a more effective way to reduce cleaner production fraud. To contribute to a healthy competitive market environment, government supervision should establish a feedback mechanism, and make timely adjustments.  aPublisher supplied data  a71991465cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a71774053cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3abusiness enterprises 3afraud 3aincome 3amarkets 3amodels 3apollution 3aresearch 3asocial responsibility 3asupply chain1 aLi, Yemei1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7577-50010 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2022 June, v. 29, no. 29 p.44638-44652dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-022-18776-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03245naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100002100191245014600212300001600358506007600374520116200450592002801612506003701640650001901677650002401696650002101720650001601741650002501757650001101782650001401793650002001807650001001827650002001837650002101857650002101878650001701899650001801916650001201934650001301946653001401959653000801973653001001981653001401991653003202005653003702037653001902074653002202093653001602115653002602131653001802157653000902175653001702184653002002201653001302221653000902234653001602243653001302259700002302272700002102295700002402316773010102340856008502441852000902526655001202535IND60683537520221207093529.0200221e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068353752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molimm.2020.01.0202doi7 aPMC71126852pmcid7 a320146322pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPremraj, Avinash10aCamelid type I interferons: Identification and functional characterization of interferon alpha from the dromedary camel (Camelus dromedarius)  ap. 132-143.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aInvestigations into the molecular immune response of dromedary camel, a key livestock species of the arid, have been limited due to the lack of species-specific reagents. Here we describe for the first time, the identification and characterization of type I IFNs of dromedary camel, which are the most important cytokines in the innate host immune response against viruses. We cloned camel IFN-α coding sequences and identified a total of eleven subtypes. The canonical IFN-α subtype designated as IFN-α1 contained a 555-bp Open Reading Frame encoding a protein of 184 amino acids. Recombinant IFN-α1 protein was produced in E. coli and purified from inclusion bodies. Recombinant camel IFN-α1 induced the mRNA expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) in camel kidney cells. The purified protein also showed potent in-vitro antiviral activity against Camelpox Virus in kidney cells. The identified camel IFN-α protein and the subtypes will facilitate a better understanding of the host immune response to viral infections in camel and the development of potential antiviral biologicals for zoonotic diseases for which camel act as a reservoir.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCamelpox virus 3aCamelus dromedarius 3aEscherichia coli 3aamino acids 3aantiviral properties 3acamels 3acytokines 3agene expression 3agenes 3aimmune response 3ainclusion bodies 3ainterferon-alpha 3akidney cells 3amessenger RNA 3aviruses 3azoonoses 0aAntiviral 0aIFN 0aVirus 0aInfection 0aInterferon-stimulated genes 0aRecombinant protein purification 0aInclusion body 0aProtein refolding 0aRare codons 0aColumn chromatography 0aReal-time PCR 0aRACE 0aGene walking 0aCamel cell line 0aZoonotic 0aMERS 0aCoronavirus 0aPoxvirus1 aAleyas, Abi George1 aNautiyal, Binita1 aRasool, Thaha Jamal0 tMolecular immunology.g2020 Mar., v. 119 p.132-143dElsevier LtdwJournal:12510x0161-58907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molimm.2020.01.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02167naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001500153245009700168300001500265520096800280592002801248650002501276650002901301650001901330650001401349650001701363650001301380650001401393650001101407700001701418700001601435700001501451700001701466700001601483700001601499700001801515700002301533773010501556856008701661852000901748655001201757IND60087688320221120162958.0141102e20130205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008768832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enzmictec.2012.11.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorata, A.10aReduction of 4-ethylphenol production in red wines using HCDC+ yeasts and cinnamyl esterases  ap. 99-104.  aHydroxycinnamate decarboxylase (HCDC) activity has been evaluated in several commercial yeast strains. The combined effect of using cinnamyl esterases (CE) and HCDC+ Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains has been studied in the formation of vinylphenolic pyranoanthocyanins (VPAs) during fermentation, analysing the kind and concentration of pigments formed according to the yeast strain used. Wines fermented with yeasts HCDC+ were contaminated with Dekkera bruxellensis and afterwards analysed to evaluate the formation of ethylphenols (EPs). The musts treated with CE and later fermented with HCDC+ yeast strains showed lower contents of 4-ethylphenol than those fermented with HCDC− strains. This reduction in the EP content is due to the transformation of hydroxycinnamic acids in stable VPAs pigments. The associated use of CEs and HCDC+ Saccharomyces strains is a natural strategy to reduce the formation of EPs in wines contaminated by Dekkera/Brettanomyces.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDekkera bruxellensis 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3acoumaric acids 3aesterases 3afermentation 3apigments 3ared wines 3ayeasts1 aVejarano, R.1 aRidolfi, G.1 aBenito, S.1 aPalomero, F.1 aUthurry, C.1 aTesfaye, W.1 aGonzález, C.1 aSuárez-Lepe, J.A.0 tEnzyme and microbial technology.g2013 Feb. 5, v. 52, no. 2 p.99-104dElsevier Inc.x0141-02297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enzmictec.2012.11.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02942naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245010800158300002000266520171100286592002801997650001502025650000802040650001502048650001102063650002102074650001402095650001102109650001702120650002602137650001202163650001302175650001102188650002102199700002302220700002202243700001702265700002002282773013402302856007502436852000902511655001202520IND60539036320221120063730.0160815e20131211xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053903632DNAL7 a10.1021/ja40637132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHof, Ferdinand10aNew Basic Insight into Reductive Functionalization Sequences of Single Walled Carbon Nanotubes (SWCNTs)  ap. 18385-18395.  aThe reactivity of reduced single walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) (carbon nanotubides), prepared under strict inert conditions in a glovebox with respect to the covalent functionalization with hexyl iodide and subsequent exposure to ambient conditions (air, moisture), was systematically investigated by Raman, absorption, fluorescence, and IR spectroscopy as well as by TG/MS measurements. We have discovered that the alkylation does not lead to a complete discharging of the tubes since follow-up reactions with moisture still take place leading to mixed functionalized carbon nanotube derivatives containing H- and OH-addends (but no carboxylates) next to the hexyl groups. This was confirmed by the exposure of carbon nanotubides to ambient conditions. The degree of hexylation determined both under strict inert (ic) and ambient (ac) conditions increases with an increasing K:C ratio of the reduced SWCNT starting material. The presence of OH-groups covalently attached to the nanotubes was also confirmed by postfunctionalization reactions with 2-thiophenecarbonyl chloride, leading to the corresponding esters. Control experiments with KO₂ give rise to the formation of the same oxygen functionalities. These combined findings allowed for the suggestions of a plausible reaction mechanism, describing all the observed reactions on the SWCNTs side walls. The amount of subsequent side reactions after the treatment of reduced SWCNTs with electrophiles is strongly influenced by the reduction potential of the electrophile, which is responsible for the extent of reoxidation. Incomplete quenching of negative charges allows stronger oxidants/electrophile (e.g., O₂) to perform follow-up reactions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aair 3aalkylation 3acarbon 3acarbon nanotubes 3achlorides 3aesters 3afluorescence 3ainfrared spectroscopy 3aiodides 3aoxidants 3aoxygen 3asuperoxide anion1 aBosch, Sebastián,1 aEigler, Siegfried1 aHauke, Frank1 aHirsch, Andreas0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2013 Dec. 11, v. 135, no. 49 p.18385-18395dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fja40637133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03286naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006300140245012100203300001800324500002000342520163900362592002802001596014002029596015202169650002802321650001302349650001302362650000902375650002502384650001602409650001602425650001602441650002502457650002102482650002402503650000902527651001102536700002902547700003202576700002802608773012002636856007502756852000902831655001202840IND60795128120221120160828.0221001e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079512812DNAL7 a10.1002/agj2.211502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHungria, Mariangela1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5132-868510aImproving maize sustainability with partial replacement of N fertilizers by inoculation with Azospirillum brasilense  ap. 2969-2980.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aMaize (Zea mays L.) is a major cereal crop worldwide and demands N fertilizers, which can be replaced partially by plant growth‐promoting bacteria. In Brazil, inoculants carrying Azospirillum brasilense strains Ab‐V5 and Ab‐V6 have exponentially grown, but a quantitative study on the replacement of N fertilizer by inoculants is still missing. Under greenhouse conditions, we investigated the effects of A. brasilense cells and metabolites applied via seeds or leaf‐sprayed at the V3 growth stage on roots and confirmed strong benefits in traits that improve the uptake of water and nutrients. In the field, 30 trials were performed at 13 sites in Brazil over 10 yr, comparing noninoculated and inoculated maize receiving 0, 50, 75, and 100% (90 kg ha–¹ of N) of N fertilizer (urea) applied as side‐dress 35 d after emergence. Overall, inoculation significantly increased grain yield by 3.1%. Increases were confirmed in lower and higher yield levels, subtropical and tropical conditions, and clayey and sandy soils, with low and higher soil organic carbon levels. Yield increases due to inoculation were statistically significant at all levels of N fertilizer, except for at 50%. Inoculation with the supply of 75% of N increased yield by 4.6% compared with the noninoculated counterpart and, noteworthy, did not differ statistically from the non‐inoculated control receiving 100% of N. These results confirmed the feasibility of replacing 25% of N‐fertilizer applied as side‐dress by seed inoculation with A. brasilense, besides the possibility of avoiding the emission of 4.95 million Mg of CO₂‐e per year.  aPublisher supplied data  aCNPq 465133/2014‐4cINCT ‐ Plant Growth‐Promoting Microorganisms for Agricultural Sustainability and Environmental Responsibility  aFundação Araucária‐STI 043/cINCT ‐ Plant Growth‐Promoting Microorganisms for Agricultural Sustainability and Environmental Responsibility 3aAzospirillum brasilense 3aZea mays 3aagronomy 3acorn 3adevelopmental stages 3agrain yield 3agreenhouses 3ametabolites 3anitrogen fertilizers 3aseed inoculation 3asoil organic carbon 3aurea 3aBrazil1 aBarbosa, Julierme Zimmer1 aRondina, Artur Berbel Lirio1 aNogueira, Marco Antonio0 tAgronomy journal.g2022 Sept., v. 114, no. 5 p.2969-2980dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44592x0002-19627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/agj2.211503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03352naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245009000169300001200259500001900271520211700290592002802407650000902435650002102444650002002465650001502485650001702500650001502517650001302532650002402545650001702569650001102586650001002597700001802607700002202625700002202647700001802669700001702687773013402704856008302838852000902921655001202930IND60701410920221118120218.0200726e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070141092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jneb.2020.04.1702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPerez, Angelique10aP123 Nourishing Food Literacy, Community Health, and Sense of Place in Louisville, KY  ap. S74.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe Food Literacy Project (FLP) has cultivated rich, experiential programming to address the lack of access to healthy nutrition opportunities in their community since 2006. In 2018, FLP received a 2-year, USDA NIFA grant to support programming and build community capacity in an area of Louisville, KY with health disparities.The purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of the nutrition education and food system engagement programming, as well as the organization's ability to mobilize community capacity to address nutrition and food access challenges.Qualitative data were collected through interviews and focus groups of program participants (youth who participated in summer and school-year programming and farming employment) and key stakeholders (community members, teachers, business owners, physicians, and legislators).The interview and focus group sessions lasted approximately 30-60 minutes and were audio-recorded. Field notes of observations were recorded as well. All interview and focus group data were transcribed verbatim and compiled with data from field notes. Data were coded into emergent themes and discussion of the themes ensued until all researchers reached consensus.A total of 15 individuals (7 youth and 8 key stakeholders) engaged in interviews or focus groups. Emergent themes among youth included not realizing inequities regarding access to healthy foods in less affluent neighborhoods, and frustration with decision-makers not listening and addressing their needs. Emergent themes among key stakeholders included significant concerns to avoid community mistrust and an appreciation for the organization being a model program for youth development.The FLP is on-target to meet its overall mission of providing programming and building community capacity. Areas to focus future attention would be to continue to offer excellent food literacy and leadership programming to not only give youth a voice but to connect them with appropriate decision-makers, and to include more community members in conversations and programming to continue to build community trust.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUSDA 3acommunity health 3adecision making 3aemployment 3afocus groups 3aleadership 3aliteracy 3anutrition education 3astakeholders 3asummer 3ayouth1 aBrown, Aishia1 aElmore, Shakeyrah1 aHartson, Kimberly1 aO'Neal, Carol1 aKing, Kristi0 tJournal of nutrition education and behavior.g2020 July, v. 52, no. 7 p.S74-S74dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl70490x1499-40467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jneb.2020.04.1703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02905naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245014800166520124400314592002801558650003101586650001901617650000801636650001201644650001201656650002001668650001601688650001101704650001101715650002101726650002801747650002201775650001401797650001401811650001301825650000901838650001301847653001401860653001001874653001301884653001201897653002101909700001401930700001401944700001301958700001801971700001301989700005302002700001502055700005902070773011502129856008602244852000902330655001202339IND60734880320221121221912.0220110e20210905xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073488032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.1259002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQi, Wen-Yu10aSelenium nanoparticles ameliorate Brassica napus L. cadmium toxicity by inhibiting the respiratory burst and scavenging reactive oxygen species  aCadmium (Cd) is a widely distributed soil contaminant which induces oxidative damage and is therefore toxic to plants. Although selenium oxyanions such as selenite (SeO₃²⁻) and selenate (SeO₄²⁻) can alleviate Cd stress to plants, it is not known whether selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs) are able to do the same. The present study demonstrated the positive impact of both SeNPs and SeO₃²⁻ on Brassica napus L. growth under conditions of Cd stress. Underlying mechanisms were elucidated using an oxidative stress detection assay, whole-genome RNA sequencing, and RT-qPCR. Application of selenium, especially in the form of SeNPs, decreased Cd-induced reactive oxygen species production by inhibiting the expression of NADPH oxidases (BnaRBOHC, BnaRBOHD1, and BnaRBOHF1) and glycolate oxidase (BnaGLO), thereby decreasing oxidative protein and membrane lipid damage. In addition, SeNPs improved resistance to Cd stress by decreasing Cd accumulation, maintaining intracellular calcium homeostasis, promoting disulfide bond formation, and restoring the waxy outer layer of the leaf surface. Although both forms of selenium decreased Cd toxicity, the beneficial concentration range was more extensive for SeNPs than for SeO₃²⁻.  aPublisher supplied data 3a(S)-2-hydroxy-acid oxidase 3aBrassica napus 3aRNA 3acadmium 3acalcium 3adisulfide bonds 3ahomeostasis 3aleaves 3alipids 3aoxidative stress 3areactive oxygen species 3arespiratory burst 3aselenates 3aselenites 3aselenium 3asoil 3atoxicity 0aCd stress 0aSeNPs 0aSelenite 0aRNA-seq 0aOxidative stress1 aLi, Qiang1 aChen, Hui1 aLiu, Jun1 aXing, Su-Fang1 aXu, Meng1 aYan, Zhen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6213-90541 aSong, Chao1 aWang, Shu-Guang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9381-17710 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2021 Sept. 05, v. 417 p.125900-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.1259003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01266naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002500138245010800163300001800271520028400289592002800573650002700601650002300628650001600651650001700667650002300684650001300707700002800720773013400748856007300882852000900955655001200964IND60658592620221121103723.0190826e20100413xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065859262DNAL7 a10.1039/b925459e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChandrasekhar, Naisa10aEngineering self-assembled fluorescent organic nanotapes and submicrotubes from π-conjugated molecules  ap. 2915-2917.  aFluorescent elongated nanotapes and nearly monodispersed short submicrotubes were successfully prepared in a controlled manner from two tailor-made π-conjugated organic building blocks 1 and 2, respectively in dichloromethane solvent via a supramolecular self-assembly approach.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical communication 3achemical reactions 3aengineering 3afluorescence 3amethylene chloride 3asolvents1 aChandrasekar, Rajadurai0 tChemical communications.g2010 Apr. 13, v. 46, no. 17 p.2915-2917dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b925459e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03113naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245007600168300001400244520187600258592002802134650002502162650001302187650001402200650002802214650001802242650001302260650001102273650001302284650001702297650001202314650002002326653001302346653002102359653002402380653001302404700001602417700002102433700002102454773011002475856008502585852000902670655001202679IND60567211020221121163035.0181102e20170801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056721102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.memsci.2017.04.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBenet, Eduard14aThe porous media's effect on the permeation of elastic (soft) particles  ap. 10-19.  aTo further the ability to design membranes for separation/fractionation of deformable particles (such as, cells, liposomes, vesicles, and droplets in emulsions and oil-water suspensions), we have developed a 2-d multiscale computational approach to study how the pressure drops and bulk flow within the depth of a porous "membrane" influences the mobility of an immiscible droplet through that structure. We use a combination of the extended finite element method to describe the creeping fluid flow (Re ~ 0) inside a portion of a filtration membrane with an embedded fluid droplet, coupled with a particle method that interpolates the droplet's interfacial position, as well as, the corresponding velocity and pressure fields using least square fitting. We calculated how the combination of several model 2-d porous network domain geometries (pore size and distribution), and a soft particle's deformation-related property (surface tension), influences the particles' velocity relative to the bulk fluid flux (aka sieving) in model porous domains made up of circular obstacles. The focus in this paper is on the scaling relationship between the particle's properties, the geometry of the system, and the overall droplet's sieving through a periodic domain. We present first the case of a droplet permeating through an individual pore to determine its critical pressure. Then, the base case of a single pore and droplet is extended to include arrays of obstacles (creating a porous network domain) with different droplet volume fraction. In this case, the applied trans-domain pressure gradient is not the same pressure drop each droplet experiences when it needs to deform in order to pass between obstacles (a pore throat), which results in a non-intuitive motion. These cases can provide a set of scaling rules to guide membrane design for droplet separation purposes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aartificial membranes 3adroplets 3aemulsions 3afinite element analysis 3afractionation 3ageometry 3amodels 3aporosity 3aporous media 3asieving 3asurface tension 0aColloids 0aDepth filtration 0aImmiscible droplets 0aModeling1 aBadran, Aly1 aPellegrino, John1 aVernerey, Franck0 tJournal of membrane science.g2017 Aug. 01, v. 535 p.10-19dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12468x0376-73887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2017.04.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01419naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002700138245011300165300001800278520022100296592002800517650002700545650002300572650001100595650000900606650001200615650001300627650001300640700001800653700001800671700002100689700001800710700002000728700001900748700002100767700001800788773013400806856007200940852000901012655001201021IND60658592720221121103811.0190817e20100323xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065859272DNAL7 a10.1039/b925469b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTanh Jeazet, Harold B.10aSelf-assembly of neutral hexanuclear circular copper(ii) meso-helicates: topological control by sulfate ions  ap. 2373-2375.  aBis-pyridylimine ligands with different linking elements are capable of forming unique hexanuclear circular Cu(ii) meso-helicates; the self-assembly is controlled by coordination of sulfate ions to the metal centres.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical communication 3achemical reactions 3acopper 3aions 3aligands 3asulfates 3atopology1 aGloe, Kerstin1 aDoert, Thomas1 aKataeva, Olga N.1 aJäger, Anne,1 aGeipel, Gerhard1 aBernhard, Gert1 aBüchner, Bernd,1 aGloe, Karsten0 tChemical communications.g2010 Mar. 23, v. 46, no. 14 p.2373-2375dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b925469b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02208naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002000152245012900172300001600301500002000317520071400337592002801051596002901079596003401108650001101142650002601153650002001179650001501199650002301214650002201237650001601259650001701275650002001292650001601312650003501328650002701363650002301390650002001413650001501433651001001448700001901458700002101477773014201498852000901640856008901649655001201738IND4379623820221120161232.0200107e200605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437962382DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1467-8276.2006.00874.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKuosmanen, Timo10aSpecification and Estimation of Production Functions Involving Damage Control Inputs: A Two‐Stage, Semiparametric Approach  ap. 499-511.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aProductivity assessment of damage control inputs (such as pesticides) is complicated because their effect depends on the exposure to damage agents (such as pests). We discuss some open specification and estimation issues. The contribution is threefold. First, we elaborate the separability conditions for the damage control function and production function. Second, we employ a two‐stage semiparametric technique to combine attractive features of both nonparametric and parametric approaches. Third, we model the interaction between pest exposure and damage control inputs by using slope dummies. An application to productivity analysis of small scale Bt cotton production in China illustrates the approach.  aPublisher supplied data  cEmil Aaltonen Foundation  aQLK5-CT-2002-01666cEU ECOGEN 3acotton 3ainsecticidal proteins 3acrop production 3atransgenes 3aGossypium hirsutum 3atransgenic plants 3acrop damage 3apest control 3acontrol methods 3acrop losses 3aagricultural management models 3aBacillus thuringiensis 3aeconometric models 3apest resistance 3apesticides 3aChina1 aPemsl, Diemuth1 aWesseler, Justus0 tAmerican journal of agricultural economics.g2006 May, v. 88, no. 2 p.499-511dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl44932x0002-90927nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-8276.2006.00874.x3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03287naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245012600170300001200296500001900308520214600327592002802473650001102501650002302512650002402535650002202559650001102581650002402592650001202616650002202628650002402650650001002674651001502684773013402699856008302833852000902916655001202925IND60701411120221118120952.0200726e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070141112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jneb.2020.04.1722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSrivastava, Deepa10aP125 Role of Cooperative Extension in Obesity Prevention Efforts: Program Implementation, Effectiveness, and Implications  ap. S75.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aTo demonstrate how Cooperative Extension (CE) can successfully implement federally-funded obesity prevention programs across limited-resource populations and settings.Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program - Education (SNAP-Ed) evaluation framework was utilized spanning multiple levels of the Social-Ecological Model (SEM).Preschoolers, youth, and adults.During 2019, 2 federally-funded nutrition education programs namely CalFresh Healthy Living, University of California (CFHL, UC) and Expanded Food & Nutrition Education Program (EFNEP) were implemented in preschool, schools, and community settings in 2 counties through CE.Age-appropriate observational tools and surveys were used to assess participants’ goals, intentions and behaviors about healthy eating, physical activity, and food resource management. Policy, systems, and environmental (PSE) changes including community partnerships were also recorded.CFHL, UC evaluation results indicated behavioral and organizational changes through direct nutrition education (n = 10,761 children and youth, and 822 adults reached) and indirect nutrition education (n = 31, 421) across 74 locations of various settings from preschools, schools, to community. PSE changes were recorded at 42 sites reaching 21,087 participants with 59 PSE changes across all settings (eg, 41 nutrition changes, 15 PA changes, and 3 nutrition/PA changes combined). EFNEP evaluation results indicated behavioral changes in nutrition, food resource management, and PA practices among adult participants (n = 187) who completed the program.CE plays a critical role in obesity prevention efforts by implementing federally-funded nutrition education programs in local communities to empower children, youth, and families with knowledge and skills to make healthy living choices. The CE System with offices in most counties across the state brings together expertise and capacity to promote healthy living among qualified settings and the SNAP-Ed eligible population. Taken together, CE is a good fit for obesity prevention programming to achieve a broader impact that has public value significance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aeducation programs 3aextension education 3aissues and policy 3amodels 3anutrition education 3aobesity 3aphysical activity 3aresource management 3ayouth 3aCalifornia0 tJournal of nutrition education and behavior.g2020 July, v. 52, no. 7 p.S75-S75dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl70490x1499-40467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jneb.2020.04.1723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03010naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245011000167300001400277500001500291520177200306592002802078650003402106650001802140650001702158650001302175650001402188650002002202650002802222650003302250650004402283650001902327650001302346650001202359653001802371700001902389773011002408856008502518852000902603655001202612IND60567211220221121163117.0180830e20170715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056721122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.memsci.2017.04.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Jinpeng10aHigh-flux thin-film composite polyelectrolyte hydrogel membranes for ethanol dehydration by pervaporation  ap. 83-91.  a2019-12-06  aA thin-film composite (TFC) membrane for ethanol dehydration by pervaporation with a very high flux and a moderately high separation factor was fabricated using a strong polyelectrolyte hydrogel as an active layer. The thin-film hydrogel was graft-polymerized with vinyl sulfonic acid (VSA) as the polymer monomer and N, N′-methylenbisacrylamide (MBAA) as the cross-linker monomer, employing the UV photo-initiation method on a polyethersulfone ultrafiltration support. The successful grafting was confirmed by ATR-FTIR, and AFM and SEM studies showed that TFC membranes with an active layer of 100–300nm were fabricated. The IEC of the active layer increased up to ca. 3meq/g when the cross-linker fraction was changed from 1% to 5% MBAA and then decreased at 10% MBAA, probably due to the high cross-linker fraction in the active layer. The degree of swelling decreased with the cross-linker concentration and with the duration of the UV irradiation.The pervaporation performance of the TFC membranes was studied with a 90% ethanol solution at 50°C. The separation factor coincided with the increase in the IEC, which is attributed to the higher sorption of water molecules to the active layer. The degree of swelling had a lesser influence on the membrane performance than the IEC, but greater swelling decreased the performance for similar IEC values. The optimal membrane with a 7.5kgm⁻² h⁻¹ flux and a separation factor of 313 was obtained at the highest IEC and a limited degree of swelling, making it one of the membranes with the highest pervaporation separation index reported to date. However, the stability of the membrane should be improved, as its high performance decreased after 24–48h and reached a plateau after a few days of operation.  aPublisher supplied data 3athin film composite membranes 3apervaporation 3aelectrolytes 3asorption 3ahydrogels 3aultrafiltration 3aatomic force microscopy 3ascanning electron microscopy 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3asulfonic acids 3apolymers 3aethanol 0asulfonic acid1 aBernstein, Roy0 tJournal of membrane science.g2017 July 15, v. 534 p.83-91dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12468x0376-73887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2017.04.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04007naa a2200865 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003600113040001800149100001300167245010300180300001600283520161900299592002801918650001101946650001401957650000901971650001101980650001301991650003102004650001002035650004302045650002502088650001802113650001602131650001102147650001202158650005202170650001102222650005202233650001202285650002802297650000902325650002502334650003402359650006202393650003702455650005702492650003202549650005602581653000902637653000702646653000902653653000802662653001002670653001102680653000902691653000802700653000802708653000802716653000902724653001002733653000802743653000802751653000902759653001002768653000702778653000902785653002402794653001402818653002602832653001302858653001002871700001502881700001702896700001802913700001402931700001802945773007502963856008203038852000903120655001203129IND60099088720221118215347.0161021e20130915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009908872DNAL7 a237746882pmid7 a10.1016/j.gene.2013.05.0722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Rong12al-Dopa methyl ester attenuates amblyopia-induced neuronal injury in visual cortex of amblyopic cat  ap. 115-122.  aIn the present study, we aimed to assess the potential anti-amblyopic effects of l-dopa methyl ester (LDME) on visual cortex area 17 in an amblyopic feline model induced by monocular vision deprivation. After LDME administration, pathophysiologic and ultrastructural observations were utilized to examine the morphological changes of nerve cells in visual cortex area 17. Dopamine (DA) and its metabolite contents in visual cortex area 17 were investigated through HPLC analysis. Apoptotic cells in visual cortex area 17 were evaluated by TUNEL assay. Additionally, the c-fos expression both at gene and protein levels was assessed using RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry analyses, respectively. The contents of DA and its metabolites were elevated in visual cortex area 17. Neuronal rejuvenation which occurred in visual cortex area 17 was observed through anatomical and physiological assessments. Similarly, TUNEL results showed that neuronal apoptosis was inhibited in the visual cortex of amblyopic cats by both l-dopa and LDME therapies. Meanwhile, the c-fos expression was notably up-regulated at both the mRNA and protein levels by the treatments. These findings suggested that LDME treatment could effectively increase DA and its metabolite contents, and restrain the apoptotic process, as well as elevate the c-fos expression in nerve cells of visual cortex area 17. Taken together, LDME might ameliorate the functional cytoarchitecture in visual cortex area 17 through mechanisms that elevate DA content and increase endogenous c-fos expression, as well as inhibit neuronal lesion in visual cortex tissue.  aPublisher supplied data 3aL-dopa 3aapoptosis 3acats 3acortex 3adopamine 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aimmunohistochemistry 3amessenger RNA 3ametabolites 3amodels 3aneurons 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3avision 2aAmblyopiaxdrug therapyxmetabolismxpathology. 2aAnimals 2aApoptosisxdrug effects 2aCats 2aDopaminexmetabolism 2aGene Expressionxdrug effects 2aLevodopaxadministration & dosagexanalogs & derivatives. 2aNeuronsxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aProto-Oncogene Proteins c-fosxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aUp-Regulationxdrug effects 2aVisual Cortexxdrug effectsxmetabolismxpathology. 0aLDME 0aDA 0aHPLC 0aTEM 0aTUNEL 0aRT-PCR 0amRNA 0aCNS 0aBBB 0aPBS 0aEDTA 0aDOPAC 0aHVA 0aDAB 0acDNA 0aANOVA 0aSD 0aAP-1 0al-Dopa methyl ester 0aAmblyopia 0aVisual cortex area 17 0aDopamine 0ac-fos1 aLiang, Tao1 aChen, Zhaoni1 aZhang, Shijun1 aLin, Xing1 aHuang, Renbin0 tGene.g2013 Sept. 15, v. 527 p.115-122dElsevier B.V.x0378-11197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2013.05.0723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03373naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004500094040001800139100001600157245008100173300001600254520173700270592002802007650001002035650002202045650001002067650001002077650002602087650002502113650002002138650001002158650001102168650001202179650002402191650001802215650002102233650001102254650001302265650002702278650001002305651001502315653002702330653002002357653001302377653002102390700002402411700002502435700002002460700002102480700001902501700001802520700002202538700002102560773011302581856009202694852000902786655001202795IND60670398320221121062625.0191126e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067039832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2019.09.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRaja, Rekha10aCrop signalling: A novel crop recognition technique for robotic weed control  ap. 278-291.  aWeed control is a significant cost for speciality crop producers, especially on organic farms. Agricultural operations are still largely dependent on hand weeding that is labour intensive and labour shortages and rising wages have led to a surge in food production costs. Thus, there is an inherent need to automate weed control and contain both labour costs and demands. Automatically distinguishing weeds from the crop plant is a complex problem since weeds come in a wide variety of colours, shapes, and sizes, and crop plant foliage is often overlapped with itself or occluded by the weeds. Current technology in commercial use, cannot reliably and effectively perform the differentiation task in such complex scenarios in real-time. As a solution to this problem, our team at the University of California, Davis has developed a novel concept called crop signalling, a technology to make crop plants machine readable and reliably distinguishable from weeds for automatic weed control. Four different techniques have been investigated and developed to make smart crop marking systems such as a) systemic markers, b) fluorescent proteins, c) plant labels and d) topical markers. Indoor experiments have been conducted for each method. Field experiments, using plant labels and the topical markers methods, have been successfully conducted for real-time weed control in tomato and lettuce. The results demonstrated that robots could automatically detect and distinguish 99.7% of the crop plants with no false positive errors in dense complex outdoor scenes with high weed densities. The crop/weed differentiation was thus effective, fast, reliable, and commercialisation of robotic weed control using the technique may be feasible.  aPublisher supplied data 3acolor 3acommercialization 3acrops 3afarms 3afield experimentation 3afluorescent proteins 3afood production 3alabor 3aleaves 3alettuce 3amanual weed control 3aplant density 3aproduction costs 3arobots 3atomatoes 3awages and remuneration 3aweeds 3aCalifornia 0aAutomatic weed control 0aCrop signalling 0aRobotics 0aImage processing1 aSlaughter, David C.1 aFennimore, Steven A.1 aNguyen, Thuy T.1 aVuong, Vivian L.1 aSinha, Neelima1 aTourte, Laura1 aSmith, Richard F.1 aSiemens, Mark C.0 tBiosystems engineering.g2019 Nov., v. 187 p.278-291dElsevier LtdaIAgrEwJournal:jnl70639x1537-51107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2019.09.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01863naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001300142245013000155300002000285520074300305592002801048650001101076650002301087650002301110650001801133650001101151700001501162700001501177700005501192700005501247773015001302856007601452852000901528655001201537IND60667773420221118050355.0190919e20190906xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066777342DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.9b079572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYou, Cai10aNickel-Catalyzed Desymmetric Hydrogenation of Cyclohexadienones: An Efficient Approach to All-Carbon Quaternary Stereocenters  ap. 14560-14564.  aNickel-catalyzed desymmetric hydrogenation has been achieved.

When Cd²⁺ is removed from water by adsorption, it will be inhibited by these two ions. Titanate nanotubes (TNTs) have an effective adsorption capacity for Cd²⁺ due to extraordinary ion exchange property. However, TNTs also adsorb Ca²⁺ and Mg²⁺ in water. In this study, carbon-modified TNT (TNT/C) and TNT/C further treated with acid (TNT/HC) were synthesized by hydrothermal synthesis. The transmission electron microscope (TEM) images show that TNT/C or TNT/HC still keep nanotube morphology. The experimental results show the order of adsorption amount to Cd²⁺ is TNT (171.56 mg/g) > TNT/C (166 mg/g) > TNT/HC (159.88 mg/g) when there is no Ca²⁺ or Mg²⁺. But when there is 0.1 M Ca²⁺ or Mg²⁺ in the water, the order of Cd²⁺ adsorption capacity becomes TNT/HC (44.28, 49.04 mg/g) > TNT/C (58.84, 69.32 mg/g) > TNT (65.52, 70.6 mg/g). It indicates that the surface carbon modification can alleviate the hindrance of Ca²⁺ or Mg²⁺ to Cd²⁺ removal. This is because the carbon on the surface of TNT captured part of Ca²⁺ or Mg²⁺; it made more Cd²⁺ be successfully absorbed by TNT through ion exchange. This mechanism was confirmed by the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra analysis. The results of this paper can provide ideas for the adsorption and removal of Cd²⁺ in water in the presence of Ca²⁺ or Mg²⁺.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aadsorption 3acalcium 3acarbon 3aion exchange 3amagnesium 3ananotubes 3apollution 3aresearch 3atransmission electron microscopes1 aLu, Linghong1 aZhou, Tao1 aMa, Yi1 aWeng, Zhengsong0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2022 June, v. 29, no. 29 p.44794-44805dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-022-19002-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01367naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002400138245008900162300001800251520034000269592002800609650000800637650001100645650001800656650002700674650002300701650001100724650002300735650002100758700001800779700001700797773013300814856007300947852000901020655001201029IND60658592920221121103804.0190826e20100521xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065859292DNAL7 a10.1039/b925499d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBénard, Sébastien10aCopper-promoted N-cyclopropylation of anilines and amines by cyclopropylboronic acid  ap. 3393-3395.  aReaction of anilines, primary and secondary aliphatic amines with cyclopropylboronic acid in dichloroethane in the presence of Cu(OAc)₂ (1 equiv.), 2,2′-bipyridine (1 equiv.) and sodium carbonate or sodium bicarbonate (2 equiv.) under air atmosphere afforded the corresponding N-cyclopropyl derivatives in good to excellent yields.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aamines 3aboronic acids 3achemical communication 3achemical reactions 3acopper 3asodium bicarbonate 3asodium carbonate1 aNeuville, Luc1 aZhu, Jieping0 tChemical communications.g2010 May 21, v. 46, no. 19 p.3393-3395dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b925499d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03199naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002000153245009300173300001600266520179800282592002802080650003702108650001502145650001702160650001502177650001902192650002002211650002102231650002002252650002802272650001202300650002002312650000902332650001702341650001302358650001302371650001102384650003702395650001502432700001902447700001802466700001602484700001502500773010602515856008702621852000902708655001202717IND60087688920221120081956.0141102e20130305xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008768892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enzmictec.2012.12.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Juanjuan10aAmperometric glucose biosensor based on glucose oxidase–lectin biospecific interaction  ap. 134-140.  aAn amperometric glucose biosensor based on high electrocatalytic activity of gold/platinum hybrid functionalized zinc oxide nanorods (Pt–Au@ZnONRs) and glucose oxidase (GOx)–lectin biospecific interaction was proposed. The Pt–Au@ZnONRs, which were prepared through a multiple-step chemosynthesis, were modified onto the surface of glassy carbon electrode (GCE) by a simple casting method due to the excellent film forming ability of the Pt–Au@ZnONRs suspension. Subsequently, a layer of porous gold nanocrystals (pAu) film was assembled onto the Pt–Au@ZnONRs film by immersing the electrode in HAuCl₄ solution to perform the electrochemical deposition at a constant potential of −0.2V. Following that, Concanavalin A (ConA) was immobilized onto the surface of pAu film through physical adsorption and covalent binding interactions between gold nanomaterials and the amino groups or thiol groups of ConA protein. Finally, the GOx was easily immobilized on the ConA/pAu/Pt–Au@ZnONRs/GCE by the biospecific interaction between GOx and ConA. The Pt–Au@ZnONRs composites were characterized using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was used to characterize the assembly process of the modified electrode. Proposed biosensor showed a high electrocatalytic activity to the glucose with a wide linear range covering from 1.8μM to 5.15mM, a low detection limit of 0.6μM and a low apparent Michaelis–Menten constant (KM ᵃᵖᵖ) of 0.41mM. Furthermore, the biosensor exhibited good reproducibility and long-term stability, as well as high selectivity. The integration of Pt–Au@ZnONRs and GOx–lectin biospecific interaction would offer potential promise for the fabrication of biosensors and biocatalysts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aadsorption 3abiocatalysts 3abiosensors 3aconcanavalin A 3adetection limit 3aelectrochemistry 3aenzyme kinetics 3aglassy carbon electrode 3aglucose 3aglucose oxidase 3agold 3ananocrystals 3ananorods 3aplatinum 3athiols 3atransmission electron microscopy 3azinc oxide1 aWang, Chengyan1 aChen, Shihong1 aYuan, Dehua1 aZhong, Xia0 tEnzyme and microbial technology.g2013 Mar. 5, v. 52, no. 3 p.134-140dElsevier Inc.x0141-02297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enzmictec.2012.12.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03732naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005300150245011900203300001600322520204300338592002802381650002002409650002302429650002802452650001802480650001102498650001402509650002302523650001602546650002302562650002502585651001002610653002802620653002302648653001402671653000902685653001002694700001702704700001902721700001702740700001802757700001502775700001302790700005802803700001702861700001502878700001702893700001602910700005402926773010402980856008503084852000903169655001203178IND60626406620221120095013.0200117e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062640662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2018.12.0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Kejia1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1175-358010aSpatiotemporal or temporal index to assess the association between temperature variability and mortality in China?  ap. 344-350.  aEpidemiological studies increasingly provide evidence about the adverse health effects of temperature variability (TV), which reflects short-term intra- and inter-day temperature change. However, calculation of TV only considers the temporal variability and lacks spatial variability. This study intends to investigate whether the lack of spatial variability in TV calculations has biased the health effect estimates. We collected daily data from the fine-gridded hourly temperatures and more than 2 million all-cause mortality counts in Zhejiang province in China from 2009 to 2015. A spatiotemporal TV index was developed by calculating the standard deviation of the hourly temperatures based on records from multiple sites. This new index could be compared to the two typical temporal TV indices that are calculated based on the hourly temperatures from one-site and area-average records. The three types of TV are compared using a three-stage analytical approach: district-specific time series Poisson regression, meta-analysis, and calculation of attributable mortality fraction. We observe that both spatiotemporal and temporal TVs produce very similar TV–mortality associations, attributable mortality fractions, and model fits at the district level. For example, the mortality increase associated for every increase of 1 °C during 0–7 exposure days is 1.53% (95% CI: 1.31, 1.73) in spatiotemporal TV, whereas it is 1.48% (95% CI: 1.27, 1.68) and 1.45% (95% CI: 1.24, 1.67) in the one-site and area-average temporal TV, respectively. Thus, time series models using temporal TV index are equally good at estimating the associations between TV and mortality as spatiotemporal TV at the district level in population-based epidemiological studies in China. Epidemiological studies using temperature from one site or the averages of multiple sites in TV calculation will not bias the effect estimates of TV. Our study could provide an important guidance method for future TV-related research in China and even in other countries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3aanalytical methods 3aepidemiological studies 3ameta-analysis 3amodels 3amortality 3astandard deviation 3atemperature 3atemporal variation 3atime series analysis 3aChina 0aTemperature variability 0aTemperature change 0aMortality 0aRisk 0aChina1 aLi, Shanshan1 aZhong, Jieming1 aYang, Xuchao1 aFei, Fangrong1 aChen, Feng1 aZhao, Qi1 aZhang, Yunquan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2618-50881 aChen, Gongbo1 aChen, Qian1 aYe, Tingting1 aGuo, Yuming1 aQi, Jiaguo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8183-02970 tEnvironmental research.g2019 Mar., v. 170 p.344-350dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12442x0013-93517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2018.12.0373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03042naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002700148245014900175300001600324520165800340592002801998650002902026650002502055650002002080650001602100650001602116650001002132650001302142650001102155650002002166650001102186650001802197650001402215651001302229653002502242653002102267653001602288653001302304653002202317700002502339700002902364773010002393856008202493852000902575655001202584IND60544602420221118034723.0190417e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054460242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ejrh.2015.02.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDinka, Megersa Olumana10aHydrochemical characterization of various surface water and groundwater resources available in Matahara areas, Fantalle Woreda of Oromiya region  ap. 444-456.  aThe Matahara region is located in the East Showa zone of Oromiya regional state (Ethiopia). Matahra Sugar Estate and Lake Basaka (highly saline, alkaline and sodic lake) are situated within the flat plains of Matahara region. The area is vulnerable to the occurrences of various tectonic and volcanic activities due to its location in the upper most part of the Main Ethiopian Rift Valley region.In this study, the hydrochemical properties of different surface water and groundwater bodies available at Matahara region have been characterized for quality compositions. Water samples were collected from different water sources and analyzed for important major quality parameters following standard test procedures. Other chemical indices were derived from the measured quality parameters. The potential sources of minerals were suggested for each of the considered water sources based on their quality characteristics.Overall, the study result elucidates that the chemical composition of different water bodies are due to natural processes and/or anthropogenic activities within the region. The local anthropogenic processes could be discharges from factory, domestic sewage and farming activities. Some of the water types are found to have relatively higher concentration of dissolved constituents. Irrigation waters have almost equal chemical compositions, indicating their hydrochemical sources are almost the same. Most of the concentrations are relatively high in Lake Basaka, groundwater and hot springs. It is easy to imagine the potential damaging effects of such quality waters on crop production, soil properties and environment of the region.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropogenic activities 3achemical composition 3acrop production 3agroundwater 3ahot springs 3alakes 3aminerals 3asewage 3asoil properties 3asugars 3asurface water 3atectonics 3aEthiopia 0aChemical composition 0aChemical indices 0aLake Basaka 0aMatahara 0aNatural processes1 aLoiskandl, Willibald1 aNdambuki, Julius Musyoka0 tJournal of hydrology.g2015 Mar., v. 3 p.444-456dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23229x2214-58187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrh.2015.02.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03448naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002200171245011900193300001600312520147600328592002801804650002601832650002201858650002301880650002401903650001901927650001701946650002101963650001501984650001101999650003402010650002202044650002302066650001802089650001602107650002202123650001002145650004002155650005802195650002102253650002802274650002502302650001102327650001802338650004202356650001102398650000902409650003402418651001102452700001702463700001602480700001802496700001902514700001502533700001902548700001702567700001802584700000702602773010102609856005502710852000902765655001202774IND4488252320221118231617.0120727e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448825232DNAL7 a223090712pmid7 a10.1111/j.1467-789X.2011.00940.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSummerbell, C.

These reviews included three critical and narrative reviews of educational strategies and psychological approaches explaining young children's acquisition and formation of energy‐balance related behaviours, and the management of these behaviours, and also a systematic review of behavioural models underpinning school‐based interventions in preschool and school settings for the prevention of obesity in children aged 4–6 years. This paper summarises and translates the findings from these reviews into practical evidence based recommendations for researchers and policy‐makers to consider when developing and implementing interventions for the prevention of overweight and obesity in young (aged 4–6 years) children. The recommendations focus on two behaviours, physical activity and sedentary behaviour, and healthy eating, and include general recommendations, intervention approaches, interventions content, and simple messages. The review also briefly examines the role that the commercial sector plays in hindering or facilitating attempts to create healthy food environments for children. This paper also recognises that childhood obesity is not an issue for the education sector alone; it needs to be tackled at a multi sectoral level, recognizing the particularly important role of local governments, nongovernment organizations and the media.  aPublisher supplied data 3abehavior modification 3achildhood obesity 3adisease prevention 3aeducational methods 3aenergy balance 3ahealthy diet 3alocal government 3amass media 3amodels 3anongovernmental organizations 3aphysical activity 3apreschool children 3apsychotherapy 3aresearchers 3asystematic review 2aChild 2aChild Nutrition Sciencesxeducation 2aChild Nutritional Physiological Phenomenaxphysiology 2aChild, Preschool 2aEvidence-Based Medicine 2aExercisexphysiology 2aFemale 2aHealth Policy 2aHealth Promotionxmethodsxstandards. 2aHumans 2aMale 2aObesityxprevention & control 0aEurope1 aMoore, H.

Three trials were performed with 186 Corriedale ewes: 111 multiparous [(control – CON (n = 60) and synchronization – SYNC groups (n = 51)], forty-two 1.5 yr-old nulliparous (group NUL), and 33 lactating ewes with at least 28 postpartum (group PtP). All ewes were treated with a MAP sponge for 6 days. Twenty-four hours before the sponge withdrawal, all animals received 0.24 mg of cloprostenol sodium and 300 IU of eCG, and 0.05 mg of gonadorelin 36 h after sponge withdrawal and artificially inseminated (AI) 27-30 h after the GnRH administration (Day 0). A second intravaginal sponge was inserted to all groups (except for SYNC group), on Day 12. On Day 17, early pregnancy diagnosis was performed with doppler ultrasound in all ewes. Sponge withdrawal occurred on Day 18, and a new GnRH dose (0.05 mg) was administrated 36 h after it. Once again, AI 27-30 h after the GnRH administration. A final pregnancy diagnosis on Day 42 was performed in all ewes for confirmation of first diagnosis and the data were confirmed by parturition. Ewes in all groups presented estrus signs (SYNCH – 94.1%; CON – 71.7%; NUL – 83.3%; PtP – 39.4% at first AI and CON – 65.2%; NUL – 76.5%; PtP – 62.5% at the second). Pregnancy rate and pregnancy loss were not different between synchronized and resynchronized multiparous ewes (SYNCH – 56.9% vs. CON – 58.3% pregnant at D42 and SYNCH – 5.9% vs. CON – 7.1% fetal loss at D42). No differences were found between resynchronized multiparous and nulliparous ewes at the first FTAI, only fecundity was higher in multiparous ewes [CON – 0.88 vs. NUL – 0.62 (P = 0.04)]. Resynchronized multiparous ewes had higher reproductive performance than postpartum ewes that only presented pregnancy after the second FTAI [CON – 73.3% vs. PtP – 15.1% total pregnancy (P = 0.003)]. Overall, synchronization-resynchronization FTAI treatments may be included in reproductive programs in nulliparous ewes, but the treatments cannot superimpose to the limiting conditions imposed by postpartum lactating status. The resynchronization treatments allow to include practical managements with no deleterious effects in the results of the first FTAI.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCorriedale 3aartificial insemination 3acloprostenol 3aestrus 3afecundity 3afetal death 3agonadotropin-releasing hormone 3aovulation 3aparturition 3apregnancy diagnosis 3apregnancy rate 3areproductive performance 3aultrasonography 0aSheep 0aDoppler ultrasound 0aArtificial insemination 0aPregnancy diagnosis 0aProgesterone1 aBrandão, Felipe Zandonadi1 aPinto, Pedro Henrique  Nicolau1 aClariget, Raquel Perez1 aUngerfeld, Rodolfo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4685-21050 tLivestock science.g2021 May, v. 247 p.104461-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl5113x1871-14137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.livsci.2021.1044613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03148naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245008800176300001400264520176600278592002802044650000802072650001302080650001702093650002502110650001602135650001702151650001502168650002802183650001202211650002402223650000902247650001502256650001402271650001702285650001402302653001502316653002002331653002902351653000902380653002602389653001802415700002302433773011502456856008602571852000902657655001202666IND60628398120221118003322.0190325e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062839812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jconhyd.2018.12.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGharedaghloo, Behrad10aCharacterizing the immiscible transport properties of diesel and water in peat soil  ap. 11-25.  aExtensive pipeline and railway corridors crossing Canadian peatlands make them vulnerable to hydrocarbon spills, potentially impairing ecosystem health, so it is important to be able to forecast hydrocarbon fate and transport within and beyond the peatland. The redistribution of hydrocarbon liquids in groundwater systems are controlled by the multiphase flow characteristics of the aquifer material including capillary pressure-saturation-relative permeability (Pc-S-kr) relations. However, these relations have never been characterized for the hydrocarbon-water phases in peat. To address this, the flow and transport of diesel and water in peat soils were examined through a number of one dimensional vertical immiscible displacement tests, in which diesel was percolated into peat pore space displacing peat water, leading to a two-phase flow regime. Inverse modelling simulations using both Brooks and Corey's and power law relative permeability models, matched the data of the immiscible displacement tests well. Irreducible water saturation (Swirr) and the curvature of water relative permeability relation increased with peat bulk density. The residual diesel saturation (SNr) ranged between 0.3% and 17% and increased with bulk density of peat. In a given peat, SNr was a function of saturation history and increased with increasing maximum diesel saturation. The receding contact angles of water in water-air systems and diesel in diesel-air systems, respectively, were 51.7° and 61.2°, showing that the wetting tendency of peat in the air imbibition condition is toward the draining liquid. These experiments advance our knowledge on the behavior of hydrocarbons in peat, and can improve numerical modelling of hydrocarbon transport after a spill.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aaquifers 3abulk density 3aenvironmental health 3agroundwater 3ahydrocarbons 3aimbibition 3aimmiscible displacement 3aliquids 3amathematical models 3apeat 3apeat soils 3apeatlands 3apermeability 3arailroads 0aNAPL spill 0aMultiphase flow 0aResidual NAPL saturation 0aPeat 0aRelative permeability 0aContact angle1 aPrice, Jonathan S.0 tJournal of contaminant hydrology.g2019 Feb., v. 221 p.11-25dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl42311x0169-77227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jconhyd.2018.12.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02321naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245012300158300001800281520121400299592002801513650001201541650001901553650001501572650001801587650001201605650001101617650002101628650001601649700001701665700001601682700001501698700001201713700001801725773012001743856007501863852000901938655001201947IND60534041120221119030854.0160802e20131017xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053404112DNAL7 a10.1021/ef401220h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXie, Yongliang10aExperimental and Numerical Study on Laminar Flame Characteristics of Methane Oxy-fuel Mixtures Highly Diluted with CO2  ap. 6231-6237.  aAn experimental and numerical study on laminar flame characteristics of methane oxy-fuel mixtures highly diluted with CO₂ was conducted using a constant volume chamber and CHEMKIN package. The effects of high CO₂ dilution on combustion chemical reaction, flame instability, and flame radiation of CH₄/CO₂/O₂ mixtures were studied. The laminar burning velocities of CH₄/CO₂/O₂ mixtures decrease with the increase of the CO₂ fraction. CO₂ directly participates in the chemical reaction through the elementary reaction OH + CO = H + CO₂ and inhibits the combustion process by the competition of the H radical between the reverse reaction of OH + CO = H + CO₂ and the reaction H + O₂ = O + OH. This effect is more obvious for highly diluted CO₂ in the case of CH₄/CO₂/O₂ mixtures. CO₂ suppresses the flame instability by the combined effect of hydrodynamic and thermal-diffusive instabilities. The radiation of CH₄ oxy-fuel combustion is much stronger than that of CH₄/air combustion mainly because of the existence of a large fraction of CO₂ in CH₄/CO₂/O₂ flames, which will influence the wall temperature and temperature distribution in the gas turbine combustor.  aPublisher supplied data 3aburning 3acarbon dioxide 3acombustion 3ahydrodynamics 3amethane 3aoxygen 3asuperoxide anion 3atemperature1 aWang, Jinhua1 aZhang, Meng1 aGong, Jing1 aJin, Wu1 aHuang, Zuohua0 tEnergy & Fuels.g2013 Oct. 17, v. 27, no. 10 p.6231-6237dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fef401220h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03026naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245009400173300001600267520160300283592002801886650001101914650001901925650001901944650002201963650001101985650001701996650002902013650001802042650001802060650002102078650001702099650000902116650002002125650002502145650001602170653000802186653000802194653000802202653000802210653000802218653003402226653001802260653003202278700001602310773009802326856008702424852000902511655001202520IND60560440620221120141933.0180830e20170315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056044062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.12.1252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLucheroni, Carlo10aCO2 volatility impact on energy portfolio choice: A fully stochastic LCOE theory analysis  ap. 278-290.  aMarket based pricing of CO2 was designed to control CO2 emissions by means of the price level, since high CO2 price levels discourage emissions. In this paper, it will be shown that the level of uncertainty on CO2 market prices, i.e. the volatility of CO2 prices itself, has a strong influence not only on generation portfolio risk management but also on CO2 emissions abatement. A reduction of emissions can be obtained when rational power generation capacity investors decide that the capacity expansion cost risk induced jointly by CO2 volatility and fossil fuels prices volatility can be efficiently hedged adding to otherwise fossil fuel portfolios some nuclear power as a carbon free asset. This intriguing effect will be discussed using a recently introduced economic analysis tool, called stochastic LCOE theory. The stochastic LCOE theory used here was designed to investigate diversification effects on energy portfolios. In previous papers this theory was used to study diversification effects on portfolios composed of carbon risky fossil technologies and a carbon risk-free nuclear technology in a risk-reward trade-off frame. In this paper the stochastic LCOE theory will be extended to include uncertainty about nuclear power plant construction times, i.e. considering nuclear risky as well, this being the main uncertainty source of financial risk in nuclear technology. Two measures of risk will be used, standard deviation and CVaR deviation, to derive efficient frontiers for generation portfolios. Frontier portfolios will be analyzed in their implications on emissions control.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon markets 3aeconomic analysis 3aenergy 3afossil fuels 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3amarket prices 3anuclear power 3apower generation 3apower plants 3arisk 3arisk management 3astatistical analysis 3auncertainty 0aQ40 0aG31 0aG32 0aL94 0aM21 0aLevelized cost of electricity 0aNuclear power 0aRisk and deviation measures1 aMari, Carlo0 tApplied energy.g2017 Mar. 15, v. 190 p.278-290dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.12.1253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02099naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005500094040001800149100002000167245015900187300001600346520097300362592002801335653002101363653002601384653002101410653002901431700001801460700001801478700002401496700001701520773012401537856011501661852000901776655001201785IND60130339320221118231647.0151127e200704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013033932DNAL7 a10.2983/0730-8000(2007)26[201:EOSJRF]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMELENDRE, P.

To reduce these losses, eggs of Pacifastacus leniusculus were incubated at a density of 6.6 cm⁻⁻² and different removal frequencies of stage 2 juveniles from the incubators were tested: every 5, 4, 3, and 2 days, daily and only once at the end of incubation. Formaldehyde was used to control growth of fungi. The best final survival rate (88.6%) was obtained when stage 2 juveniles were removed daily from the incubators. There were no significant differences nor between removals every 2 and 3 days (79.6% and 76.5%, respectively) neither between 4 and 5 days (72.6% and 69.8%, respectively). Considering all treatments, final survival rates decreased as juvenile removal was delayed up to only one removal at the end of incubation.  aPublisher supplied data 0aastacid crayfish 0aartificial incubation 0ajuvenile removal 0aPacifastacus leniusculus1 aCELADA, J.

In this study, two polysaccharides (MCP-C and MCP-S) from Mesona chinensis were extracted by using cellulase assisted extraction (CAE) and sodium carbonate assisted extraction (SAE), separately. Then the different physicochemical characteristics, rheological and thermal properties of two polysaccharides were analyzed by ion chromatography, high-performance gel permeation chromatography (HPGPC), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), rheological and thermogravimetric analysis. Results indicated that the contents of total sugar and uronic acid of MCP-C were higher than MCP-S, while the protein content and molecular weight was lower than that of MCP-S. MCP-S and MCP-C had differences in the surface morphology by SEM, while they all had the typical IR spectra characteristic and amorphous morphology of polysaccharides. The rheological experiments showed that MCP-C and MCP-S exhibited typical pseudoplasticity fluids behavior. The apparent viscosity (η), storage modulus (G′) and complex viscosity (η*) of MCP-S were higher than MCP-C. The three-stage decomposition patterns were observed in MCP-C and MCP-S. MCP-S was more stable and had higher initial decomposition temperature (Ti) than MCP-C.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aPlatostoma palustre 3ablack beans 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3agel chromatography 3aingredients 3aion exchange chromatography 3amolecular weight 3apolysaccharides 3aprotein content 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asodium carbonate 3astorage modulus 3atemperature 3athermal properties 3athermogravimetry 3atraditional medicine 3auronic acids 3aviscosity 3aAsia 0aExtraction method 0aMesona chinensis polysaccharides 0aCellulase 0aRheology 0aThermal stability1 aLiu, Suchen1 aShen, Mingyue1 aJiang, Lian1 aRen, Yanming1 aLuo, Yu1 aWen, Huiliang1 aXie, Jianhua1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3906-12600 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2019 Apr. 01, v. 126 p.30-36dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.12.2113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03558naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100003400140245007300174300001800247500002000265520202200285592002802307650002702335650001702362650001002379650002302389650001202412650004102424650001102465650004302476650001502519650001202534650001002546650001402556650001202570650001602582650001302598650002302611650001802634650001502652700004102667700002002708700002602728700002302754700001802777700002802795773013402823856007402957852000903031655001203040IND60572133220221121060025.0170712e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057213322DNAL7 a10.1111/ijfs.134112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBautista‐Ortín, Ana Belén10aApplication of high‐power ultrasounds during red wine vinification  ap. 1314-1323.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aWine colour is one of the main organoleptic characteristics influencing its quality. It is of special interest in red vinifications due to the economic resources that wineries have to invest for the extraction of the phenolic compounds responsible for wine colour, compounds that are mainly located inside the skin cell vacuoles, where the volatile compounds are also found. The transfer of phenolic compounds from grapes to must during vinification is closely related to the type of grapes and the winemaking technique. During traditional winemaking, grapes are crushed and skin macerated for several days, with pumps overs to facilitate the colour extraction. To increase this extraction, some chemical (maceration enzymes) or physical technologies (thermovinification, cryomaceration, flash‐expansion) can be applied. In this work, a new methodology has been tested. This methodology consists in the application of high‐power ultrasounds to crushed grapes to increase the extraction of phenolic compounds. Crushed grapes were treated with this non‐thermal technology and vinified, with 3, 6 and 8 days of skin maceration time, and the results were compared with a control vinification, where crushed grapes were not subjected to any treatment and were skin macerated during 8 days. The wine chromatic characteristics (determined spectrophotometrically) and the individual phenolic compounds (anthocyanins and tannins, determined by HPLC) were followed during the maceration period, at the end of alcoholic fermentation and after two months in bottle. Also, the wine volatile compounds were determined by GC‐MS. The wines made with ultrasound‐treated grapes showed differences with the control wine, especially regarding total phenol content and tannin content. The wines elaborated with sonicated grapes and with only three days of skin maceration time presented similar concentration of anthocyanins and twice the concentration of tannins than control wines elaborated with 8 days of skin maceration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalcoholic fermentation 3aanthocyanins 3acolor 3aeconomic resources 3aenzymes 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3agrapes 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3amaceration 3aphenols 3apumps 3ared wines 3atannins 3aultrasonics 3avacuoles 3avolatile compounds 3awine industry 3awinemaking1 aJiménez‐Martínez, María Dolores1 aJurado, Ricardo1 aIniesta, Juan Alberto1 aTerrades, Salvador1 aAndrés, Ana,1 aGómez‐Plaza, Encarna0 tInternational journal of food science & technology.g2017 June, v. 52, no. 6 p.1314-1323dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0950-54237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ijfs.134113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03239naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003400113024002200147040001800169100002000187245012000207300001600327500001500343506007600358520115300434592002801587506003701615650002601652650004601678650001501724650002701739650001101766650003101777650001901808650002601827650001301853650004101866650007101907650007701978650005702055650007602112650005502188653003302243653002702276653004002303653002702343653002902370653005602399653001502455700001802470773010702488856008102595852000902676655001202685IND60112523020221207071459.0190405e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011252302DNAL7 a235412102pmid7 a10.1016/j.fm.2012.12.0082doi7 aPMC44254552pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Jiangjiang10aDetection of Escherichia coli via VOC profiling using secondary electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (SESI-MS)  ap. 412-417.  a2019-12-04  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aEscherichia coli O157:H7 (EC O157:H7), as well as its recently emerging non-O157 relatives, are a notorious group of pathogenic bacteria associated with foodborne outbreaks. In this study, we demonstrated that secondary electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (SESI-MS) could be a rapid and accurate detection technology for foodborne pathogens. With SESI-MS volatile organic compound (VOC) profiling, we were able to detect and separate a group of eleven E. coli strains from two major foodborne bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus and Salmonella Typhimurium in three food modeling media. In addition, heatmap analysis of relative peak intensity show that there are six core peaks (m/z of 65, 91, 92, 117, 118 and 119) present and at a similar intensity in all eleven E. coli strains at the experimental conditions we tested. These peaks can be considered conserved VOC biomarkers for E. coli species (robustly produced after just 4 h of growth). Bacterial strain-level differentiation was also attempted via VOC profiling, and we found that EC O157:H7 and EC O145 were differentiable from all other EC strains under the conditions investigated.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry 3abiomarkers 3aSalmonella Typhimurium 3amodels 3avolatile organic compounds 3afood pathogens 3aEscherichia coli O157 3abacteria 2aBacterial Typing Techniquesxmethods 2aEscherichia colixchemistryxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aSalmonella typhimuriumxchemistryxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aSpectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionizationxmethods 2aStaphylococcus aureusxchemistryxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aVolatile Organic Compoundsxchemistryxmetabolism. 0aFoodborne bacteria detection 0aSalmonella Typhimurium 0aVolatile organic compound profiling 0aSalmonella typhimurium 0aEscherichia coli O157:H7 0aSecondary electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry 0aBiomarkers1 aHill, Jane E.0 tFood microbiology.g2013 June, v. 34, no. 2 p.412-417dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34976x0740-00207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fm.2012.12.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02093naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002900138245010600167520110600273592002801379650001201407650002001419650001201439650001501451650002101466650001801487650001901505651001101524651001101535700002001546773012001566856007201686852000901758655001201767IND60648808620221120191258.0190701e20171116xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064880862DNAL7 a10.3390/f81104452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSundstrom, Lisa McIntosh10aPrivate Forest Governance, Public Policy Impacts: The Forest Stewardship Council in Russia and Brazil  aUnder what conditions do private forest governance standards influence state policy and behavior to become more oriented toward sustainability? We argue that governance schemes targeting firms may indirectly shape state behavior, even when designed to bypass state regulation. Through an examination of the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) in Russia and Brazil, we find that the FSC has influenced domestic rhetoric, laws, and enforcement practices. FSC has had a more disruptive and consequential impact on Russia’s domestic forest governance; in Brazil, earlier transnational environmental campaigns had already begun to shift domestic institutions toward sustainability. Based on interview data and textual analysis of FSC and government documents, we identify the mechanisms of indirect FSC influence on states—professionalization, civil society mobilization, firm lobbying, and international market pressure, and argue that they are likely to be activated under conditions of poor and decentralized governance, overlapping and competing regulations and high foreign market demand for exports.  aPublisher supplied data 3aexports 3aforeign markets 3aforests 3agovernance 3aprivate forestry 3apublic policy 3asupply balance 3aBrazil 3aRussia1 aHenry, Laura A.0 tForests.g2017 Nov. 16, v. 8, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f81104453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02555naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001500154245008800169300001600257500001900273500002000292520146000312592002801772650001901800650002801819650002301847650001101870650002001881650001001901650001101911700002101922700001601943700001701959773012001976856008802096852000902184655001202193IND60734334420221118002320.0210417e199912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073433442DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1469-8137.1999.00538.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFEUGEY, L.10aInduced defence responses limit Hartig net formation in ectomycorrhizal birch roots  ap. 541-547.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aRoots of clonal birches (Betula pendula) were inoculated with the ectomycorrhizal fungi Paxillus involutus (isolates P0 and Mi) and Hebeloma cylindrosporum (strains D1 and D105). These fungi showed different rates of mycorrhiza formation in vitro. Mature mycorrhizas were obtained after only 2–4 d with H. cylindrosporum, whereas 6–8 d were necessary with P. involutus isolate P0, and P. involutus isolate Mi was not able to form mature mycorrhiza during the 10 d of the experiment. Temporal changes in PAL activity and the expression of genes encoding intracellular pathogenesis‐related proteins were followed after inoculating birch roots with these fungi. Transient increase of PAL activity, and transient induction of expression of the wound‐inducible Bet v1‐SC1 gene, were observed in roots challenged with both H. cylindrosporum strains and the P. involutus isolate P0. These changes were found to coincide with hyphal penetration between root cells during Hartig net formation, and were never observed in roots inoculated with the poorly aggressive P. involutus isolate Mi. Examination of mycorrhizal root sections under u.v. light indicated the presence of phenolic compounds in the host cell walls at the vicinity of the Hartig net. These results strongly suggest that hyphal penetration between the root cells triggers a transient defence response which, in turn, could limit Hartig net formation to the outer layer of the root cortex.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBetula pendula 3aHebeloma cylindrosporum 3aPaxillus involutus 3acortex 3aectomycorrhizae 3agenes 3ahyphae1 aSTRULLU, D.‐G.1 aPOUPARD, P.1 aSIMONEAU, P.0 tnew phytologist.g1999 Dec., v. 144, no. 3 p.541-547dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl44665x0028-646X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1469-8137.1999.00538.x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02831naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100003200152245018000184300001600364520128300380592002801663650002401691650002301715650001901738650001801757650002501775650002401800650001301824650001301837650002601850650003501876650003301911650000901944650000901953653001901962653001501981653000801996653002302004653002902027700002602056700002502082700002302107773013502130856008702265852000902352655001202361IND60629093520221120193956.0220214e20190401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062909352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2019.01.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSabapathy, Poorna Chandrika10aPolyhydroxyalkanoate production from statistically optimized media using rice mill effluent as sustainable substrate with an analysis on the biopolymer's degradation potential  ap. 977-986.  aThe present study focuses on the optimization of the bioprocess for the fermentative production of polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) by Acinetobacter junii BP 25 using rice mill effluent as a cheap substrate, henceforth to develop an economically feasible biopolymer production process. Statistical tools like Plackett-Burman design (PBD) and Response Surface Methodology (RSM) were used to evaluate the important variables that influence the yield of PHA. Initially from PBD three factors (glycerol, KH₂PO₄ and incubation time) were taken for further optimization using Box-Behnken design where, the interaction between each of the factors were studied in detail, providing a final optimized media for the high concentration of PHA. Before the optimization process the concentration of PHA was 0.52 ± 0.05 g/l for 1.07 ± 0.32 g/l cell dry mass (CDM) after which a 5.84 fold increase in PHA concentration was observed with 3.04 g/l of PHA. Biodegradation studies of the produced PHA sheets were investigated briefly in both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystem, showing degradation within 8 weeks in soil and 4 weeks in water which was very promising, as the non-degrading property of the conventional plastic have made scientist to research on biopolymers mainly.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcinetobacter junii 3aaquatic ecosystems 3abiodegradation 3abioprocessing 3aeconomic feasibility 3aexperimental design 3aglycerol 3aplastics 3apolyhydroxyalkanoates 3apotassium dihydrogen phosphate 3aresponse surface methodology 3arice 3asoil 0aBiodegradation 0aBiopolymer 0aPHA 0aRice mill effluent 0aStatistical optimization1 aDevaraj, Sabarinathan1 aParthipan, Anburajan1 aKathirvel, Preethi0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2019 Apr. 01, v. 126 p.977-986dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2019.01.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03401naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245011500164520164100279592002801920650001801948650001301966650001401979650001301993650001302006650001102019650001702030650002202047650001702069650002502086650003002111650001902141650002902160650001102189650002602200650001202226650002302238650001102261650001302272650001902285650001902304650001402323650001302337650001602350650001802366650001102384653003002395653002902425653002602454653002202480700001202502700001602514700001702530700001802547773012702565856008602692852000902778655001202787IND60702685320221122060448.0220207e20201110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070268532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1230062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Xin10aLife cycle assessment of lithium nickel cobalt manganese oxide (NCM) batteries for electric passenger vehicles  aThis study evaluated and quantified the life cycle environmental impacts of lithium-ion power batteries (LIBs) for passenger electric vehicles to identify key stages that contribute to the overall environmental burden and to find ways to reduce this burden effectively. Primary data for the assessment were collected onsite from the two Chinese leading LIB suppliers, two leading cathode material producers and two battery recycling corporations from 2017 to 2019. Six environmental impact categories, including primary energy demand (PED), global warming potential (GWP), acidification potential (AP), photochemical oxidant creation potential (POCP), eutrophication potential (EP) and human toxicity potential (HTP), were considered in accordance with the ISO 14040/14044 standards. The results indicate that material preparation stage is the largest contributor to the LIB’s life cycle PED, GWP, AP, POCP, EP and HTP, with the cathode active material, wrought aluminum and electrolytes as the predominant contributors. In the production stage, vacuum drying and coating and drying are the two main processes for all the six impact categories. In the end-of-life stage, waste LIBs recycling could largely reduce the life cycle POCP and HTP. Sensitivity analysis results depict that replacing NCM 622 by NCM 811 as the cathode active material could increase all the six environmental impacts. We hope this study is helpful to reduce the uncertainties associated with the life cycle assessment of LIBs in existing literatures and to identify opportunities to improve the environmental performance of LIBs within the whole life cycle.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidification 3aaluminum 3abatteries 3acathodes 3acoatings 3acobalt 3acorporations 3aelectric vehicles 3aelectrolytes 3aenvironmental impact 3aenvironmental performance 3aeutrophication 3aglobal warming potential 3ahumans 3alife cycle assessment 3alithium 3amanganese monoxide 3anickel 3aoxidants 3aphotochemistry 3aprimary energy 3arecycling 3atoxicity 3auncertainty 3avacuum drying 3awastes 0aLithium-ion power battery 0aBattery electric vehicle 0aLife cycle assessment 0aBattery recycling1 aSitong,1 aZhang, Zhan1 aMeng, Fanran1 aYang, Jianxin0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2020 Nov. 10, v. 273 p.123006-dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1230063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02103naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245006400166300001400230520093900244592002801183650001501211650001101226650001901237650001301256650001301269650001501282650001301297650001701310653000801327653000801335653002001343653000901363653000801372653001601380653002101396700005301417773012901470856008501599852000901684655001201693IND60722335920221122092649.0210101e20201130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072233592DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jproteome.0c004092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yang10aProteome-Scale Analysis of Protein S-Acylation Comes of Age  ap. 14-26.  aProtein S-acylation (commonly known as palmitoylation) is a widespread reversible lipid modification, which plays critical roles in regulating protein localization, activity, stability, and complex formation. The deregulation of protein S-acylation contributes to many diseases such as cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. The past decade has witnessed substantial progress in proteomic analysis of protein S-acylation, which significantly advanced our understanding of S-acylation biology. In this review, we summarized the techniques for the enrichment of S-acylated proteins or peptides, critically reviewed proteomic studies of protein S-acylation at eight different levels, and proposed major challenges for the S-acylproteomics field.

Lantana camara an invasive weed has become the common part of a bushes. The mutualistic relationship between this weed plant and butterflies are well known. Butterflies depend on Lantana camara for food, oviposition site, larval development etc. In this context we are highlighting the role of this invasive weed for butterfly conservation and maintaining total butterfly abundance. In this study the species richness highest for the site where the bushes were dominated by Lantana camara and lowest for the site where LCA abundance was low. The butterfly abundance and LCA abundance maintain a strong positive relationship and LCA abundance, species richness and and butterfly abundance are strongly correlated and dominance is negatively correlated with other three variables. So we can use the Lantana camara as a model organism for conservation and maintaining the butterfly abundance in Purulia, West Bengal, India.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLantana camara 3abutterflies 3aecosystems 3ainvasive species 3alarval development 3aoviposition sites 3aspecies richness 3aweeds 3aIndia 0aButterfly 0aConservation 0aButterfly abundance1 aAhmed, Md Tousif1 aHossain, Asif0 tActa ecologica Sinica.g2021 Feb. 22, dElsevier B.V.aEcological Society of ChinawJournal:J000000040x1872-20327nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chnaes.2021.02.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02208naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245014000156300002000296520090500316592002801221650001501249650001801264650001401282650001301296650002001309650001401329650002401343650001001367650001901377650001901396650001801415650001901433650001901452650001701471650002101488700002501509700001601534700001701550773012401567856007401691852000901765655001201774IND60664430520221118073018.0190912e20130722xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066443052DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ra22950e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Minmin10aGreen chemistry synthesis of a nanocomposite graphene hydrogel with three-dimensional nano-mesopores for photocatalytic H₂ production  ap. 13169-13177.  aIn this work, we have developed a nanocomposite graphene hydrogel (NGH) based on green chemistry, employing vitamin C (VC) to attain a supramolecular 3D network of hybrid nanostructured materials.

Finally, we demonstrate practical applications of utilizing the NGH with water containing pores for photocatalytic H₂ production. An important pragmatic consideration of using a NGH is the ease of separation and recovery of the nanosized catalyst after the photoreaction which would otherwise require extensive and expensive nanofiltration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aascorbic acid 3acatalysts 3agraphene 3agreen chemistry 3ahydrogels 3ahydrogen production 3alight 3ananocomposites 3ananofiltration 3ananoparticles 3aphotocatalysis 3asemiconductors 3asurface area 3atitanium dioxide1 aPeh, Connor Kang Nuo1 aOng, Wei Li1 aHo, Ghim Wei0 tRSC advances.g2013 July 22, v. 3, no. 32 p.13169-13177dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3ra22950e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02867naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005700148245017100205300001600376520129000392592002801682650001101710650001401721650002101735650001701756650001901773650001401792650000901806650001301815650001101828653003301839653000901872653001501881653003001896653001701926700001501943700001801958700001701976700001801993700001802011700006102029700002002090700005802110773012502168856008302293852000902376655001202385IND60733943120221120075149.0220103e20210815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073394312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2021.03.0812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMehmood, Asad1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8744-110510aDevelopment of a highly active Fe[sbnd]N[sbnd]C catalyst with the preferential formation of atomic iron sites for oxygen reduction in alkaline and acidic electrolytes  ap. 148-157.  aNitrogen-doped porous carbons containing atomically dispersed iron are prime candidates for substituting platinum-based catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in fuel cells. These carbon catalysts are classically synthesizedviacomplicated routes involving multiple heat-treatment steps to form the desired Fe-Nₓ sites. We herein developed a highly active FeNC catalyst comprising of exclusive Fe-Nₓ sites by a simplified solid-state synthesis protocol involving only a single heat-treatment. Imidazole is pyrolyzed in the presence of an inorganic salt-melt resulting in highly porous carbon sheets decorated with abundant Fe-Nₓ centers, which yielded a high density of electrochemically accessible active sites (1.36 × 10¹⁹ sites g⁻¹) as determined by the in situ nitrite stripping technique. The optimized catalyst delivered a remarkable ORR activity with a half-wave potential (E₁/₂) of 0.905 VRHE in alkaline electrolyte surpassing the benchmark Pt catalyst by 55 mV. In acidic electrolyte, an E₁/₂ of 0.760 VRHE is achieved at a low loading level (0.29 mg cm⁻²). In PEMFC tests, a current density of 2.3 mA cm⁻² is achieved at 0.90 VᵢR₋fᵣₑₑ under H₂–O₂ conditions, reflecting high kinetic activity of the optimized catalyst.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acatalysts 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrolytes 3aheat treatment 3aimidazole 3airon 3anitrites 3aoxygen 0aNon-precious metal catalysts 0aFeNC 0aFuel cells 0aOxygen reduction reaction 0aSite density1 aAli, Basit1 aGong, Mengjun1 aGyu Kim, Min1 aKim, Ji-Young1 aBae, Jee-Hwan1 aKucernak, Anthony1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5790-96831 aKang, Yong-Mook1 aNam, Kyung-Wan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6278-63690 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2021 Aug. 15, v. 596 p.148-157dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2021.03.0813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03004naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245014900158300001800307500002000325520202900345592002802374650001402402650001402416650002102430650001902451650001302470700002302483773011302506856007402619852000902693655001202702IND60579483820221122030949.0170818e20171001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057948382DNAL7 a10.1002/pola.287012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTakada, Kohei10aReversible addition‐fragmentation chain transfer polymerization of diisopropyl fumarate using various dithiobenzoates as chain transfer agents  ap. 3266-3275.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aDialkyl fumarates as 1,2‐disubstituted ethylenes exhibit unique features of radical polymerization kinetics due to their significant steric hindrance in propagation and termination processes and provide polymers with a rigid chain structure different from conventional vinyl polymers. In this study, we carried out reversible addition‐fragmentation chain transfer polymerization of diisopropyl fumarate (DiPF) in bulk at 80 °C using various dithiobenzoates with different leaving R groups as chain transfer agents to reveal their performance for control of molecular weight, molecular weight distribution, and chain end functionality of the resulting poly(DiPF) (PDiPF). 2‐(Ethoxycarbonyl)‐2‐propyl dithiobenzoate (DB1) and 2,4,4‐trimethyl‐2‐pentyl dithiobenzoate (DB2) underwent fragmentation and reinitiation at a moderate rate and consequently led to the formation of PDiPF with well‐controlled chain structures. It was confirmed that molecular weight of PDiPF produced by controlled polymerization with DB1 and DB2 agreed with theoretical one and molecular weight distribution was narrow. Dithiobenzoate and R fragments were introduced into the polymer chain ends with high functionality as 95% by the use of DB1. In contrast, polymerizations using 1‐(ethoxycarbonyl)benzyl dithiobenzoate (DB3), 1‐phenylethyl dithiobenzoate (DB4), and 2‐phenyl‐2‐propyl dithiobenzoate (DB5) resulted in poor control of molecular weight, molecular weight distribution, and chain end structures of PDiPF. Fragmentation and reinitiation rates of the used benzoates as chain transfer agents significantly varied depending on the R structures in an opposite fashion; that is, introduction of bulky and conjugating substituents accelerated fragmentation, but it retarded initiation of DiPF polymerization. It was revealed that balance of fragmentation and reinitiation was important for controlled polymerization of DiPF. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Polym. Sci., Part A: Polym.

Therefore, it is important to evaluate permeability of edible casing in order to determine the value of water vapour transmission, O2 and CO2 gas transmission and thickness. The aims of this research were to determine the amount of water vapour transmission by following ASTM Standard E-96 and and evaluate gas permeability. The gas barrier properties of the casing films were analysed using manometric method (ASTM D 1434). The experimental design used in this research was Randomized Block Design with 2 factors; plasticiser type (glycerol, sorbitol, sucrose) and garlic concentration (2.5%, 5%, 10%) with three replicates. The properties evaluated were thickness and value of O2 and CO2 gas transmission. The results showed that type of plasticiser and concentration of garlic affect significantly on thickness, water vapour transmission, O2 and CO2 gas transmission. The interaction of two factors has also significantly affected on thickness, water vapour transmission, O2 and CO2 gas transmission. The best combination according to Zeleny method was obtained on sucrose plasticiser and garlic 5% with thickness 0.073 mm, water vapour transmission 0.56 g/m2/h, O2 gas transmission 1.6 × 10-4 cc.mm/m2.24h.kPa and CO2 gas transmission 3.4 × 10-4 cc.mm/m2.24h.kPa.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aexperimental design 3afood science 3agarlic 3aglycerol 3apermeability 3aplasticizers 3apollution 3asausages 3ashelf life 3asorbitol 3asucrose 3asustainable agriculture 3awater vapor 0aedible casing 0ao2 0aco21 aLastriyanto, Anang1 aLastriyanto, Anang0 tAdvances in Food Science, Sustainable Agriculture, and Agroindustrial Engineering.g2019 July, v. 2, no. 1 p.1-5dUniversitas Brawijaya, Fakultas Teknologi PertanianwJournal:27915x2622-59217nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.21776/ub.afssaae.2019.002.01.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02555naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245010800170300001800278520146300296592002801759650001101787650001701798650001101815650001601826650000901842651001901851651001801870653003201888653001601920653002001936653002901956700002201985773009202007856008502099852000902184655001202193IND60611987020221120022338.0210527e20181115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061198702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2018.08.1282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaiser, Mark J.12aA hybrid scenario-based decommissioning forecast for the shallow water U.S. Gulf of Mexico, 2018–2038  ap. 1150-1177.  aThe U.S. Gulf of Mexico is one of the oldest and most prolific offshore hydrocarbon basins in the world, producing over 52 billion barrels oil equivalent, 20.7 billion barrels of oil and 187 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, from 1947 to 2017. In recent years, the shallow water region has witnessed record levels of decommissioning activity due to aging fields, sustained low oil and gas prices, and greater regulatory oversight and scrutiny. It is no longer possible for operators to ‘kick the decommissioning can’ down the road and the result is that production and the number of structures on the shelf has declined significantly and are expected to continue to decrease in the future. The purpose of this paper is to present a model framework to estimate decommissioning activity in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico in water depth less than 400 ft (122 m). The problem is challenging because offshore structures are diverse, numerous, and are used in several different ways. Decline curves and cash-flow models represent best practices for producing structures, but for structures without production new approaches are needed. Three decommissioning models are developed using a hybrid scenario and probabilities characterize transitions between classes. From 2017 to 2022, between 474 and 828 structures are expected to be decommissioned in the shallow water Gulf of Mexico, and by 2027, between 704 and 1199 structures are expected to be decommissioned.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3aenergy costs 3amodels 3anatural gas 3aoils 3aGulf of Mexico 3aUnited States 0aDecommissioning forecasting 0aPhase space 0aSchedule models 0aTransition probabilities1 aNarra, Siddhartha0 tEnergy.g2018 Nov. 15, v. 163 p.1150-1177dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2018.08.1283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02621naa a2200289 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075024005100099040001800150100001800168245013600186300001400322500000900336520160500345592002801950650002101978650002301999650001602022650001902038650001902057700001702076773011902093852000902212856009802221655001202319991574758590742620221123003334.0191122e197401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7490320792DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci1974.0011183X001400010015x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarker, R.

Heritability Estimates for Alkaloid Concentration  ap. 50-53.  aepub  aOur objectives were to estimate genotypic and environmental variances and heritability of indole alkaloid concentration in reed canarygrass (Phalaris arundinacea L.) The variance component estimates for genotype ✕ environment and genotype ✕ cutting interactions were significant but small as compared to the estimate for genetic variance among 31 unrelated clones of diverse origin. Genotype ✕ environment ✕ replication in environments interactions were statistically nonsignificant. Thus, variation in alkaloid concentration was largely associated with genotypes. Heritability studies included 36 clones and their 18 two-clone crosses grown at 2 locations. Heritability estimates from the second cutting were higher than corresponding estimates from the third cutting. Combining data from two regrowth cuttings in one season reduced the bias introduced as a result of sampling the forage at different growth stages. When based on parents in the 0.17 to 1.37% overall alkaloid concentration range, realized heritability estimates for the combined August and September cuttings ranged from 0.67 to 0.72. All heritability estimates were slightly higher for the high alkaloid concentration range compared to estimates for the low range. Narrow-sense heritability estimates were nearly as large as the corresponding broad-sense estimates; thus, total genetic variance was largely additive. Parent-offspring regression analyses of identical materials confirmed this conclusion. Our results suggest that genetic gain in alkaloid concentration can be realized from selection among individual plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aplant physiology 3aplant biochemistry 3afield crops 3aplant genetics 3aplant breeding1 aHovin, A.

Phylogenetic analysis of a broad taxon sample demonstrated that this Asian species is not a member of the genus Quedius but forms the sister taxon to the Neotropical genus Quediomacrus. Both taxa were shown to be members of a hitherto unrecognized lineage with a highly disjunct distribution. The lineage is hypothesized to be Asian in origin, with dispersals to the Americas during the early Eocene climatic maximum via Beringia and to Australia via land connections in the late Miocene. The current distribution of the lineage is considered to be relictual. New phylogenetic hypotheses within ‘Quediina’ and Staphylinini as a whole are proposed and the general tree topology of Staphylinini recovered by recent morphological studies is refined. Phylogenetic relationships within the Quedius complex remain unclear. Alesiella Brunke and Solodovnikov gen.n., is erected for Quedius lineipennis and the Quedius subgenus Quedionuchus is reinstated to genus level with new combinations as follows: Quedionuchus atl (Smetana, 1975), comb.n.; Quedionuchus calli (Smetana, 1976), comb.n.; Quedionuchus cipactli (Smetana, 1976), comb.n.; Quedionuchus coatl (Smetana, 1976), comb.n.; Quedionuchus ehacatl (Smetana, 1976), comb.n.; Quedionuchus ollin (Smetana, 1976), comb.n.; Quedionuchus ozomatli (Smetana, 1975), comb.n.; Quedionuchus reitterianus (Bernhauer, 1944), comb.n.; Quedionuchus samuraicus (Bernhauer and Schubert, 1916), comb.n.; Quedionuchus schultzei (Smetana, 1975), comb.n.; Quedionuchus tecpatl (Smetana, 1976), comb.n.; Quedionuchus xochitl (Smetana, 1976). Quedius lugubris Lokay, 1913 is transferred from the subgenus Quedionuchus to the subgenus Distichalius and placed in synonymy: Quedius punctatellus (Heer, 1839) = Quedius lugubris Lokay, 1913, syn.n.

Based on corn straw, attapulgite, zeolite, starch, and iron oxide, a series of hematite-modified biochar-clay granular composites (HGCs) were synthesized through a two-step pyrolysis process and were shown to be efficient materials for Cr(VI) removal from an aqueous solution. The physicochemical properties and morphologies of HGCs were characterized by SEM, FTIR, XRD, and XPS, which confirmed that hematite was successfully generated on the surface of HGCs. HGCs also showed a well-developed mesoporous structure as analyzed by N₂ physisorption. The maximum adsorption capacity of Cr(VI) on the HGCs at pH = 5.0 was 19.51 mg/g as calculated by the Langmuir model. The experimental data revealed that both pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-order models fitted well with adsorption kinetics of Cr(VI) on HGCs. The mechanisms of Cr(VI) removal by HGCs involved predominately with electrostatic interaction, hydrogen bond attraction, redox reaction, and coprecipitation reaction. Moreover, the strengthened electrostatic interaction between HGCs and Cr(VI) might explain the decreased adsorption capacities of Cr(VI) along with pH increasing from 1.0 to 10.0. HGCs are applied to wastewater treatment, which conforms to the concept of waste resource recovery and the topic of sustainable development. Since this novel material was proposed in this work, a new range of application is possible for water treatment processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aadsorption 3aagricultural wastes 3aaqueous solutions 3achromium 3acoprecipitation 3acorn straw 3aelectrostatic interactions 3ahematite 3ahydrogen bonding 3amodels 3ananoparticles 3anitrogen 3apH 3aporous media 3apyrolysis 3araw materials 3aredox reactions 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asewage treatment 3asorption isotherms 3astarch 3asustainable development 3awaste utilization 3awastewater treatment 3azeolites 0aAdsorption 0aWastewater 0aBiochar 0aClay 0aCr(VI)1 aWang, Shuai1 aYang, Xiao1 aTufail, Shah1 aChen, Chong1 aWang, Xiang1 aShang, Jianying0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2020 Dec. 10, v. 276 p.123009-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1230093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03446naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245010600169520197000275592002802245650001202273650001102285650002202296650001202318650001802330650002902348650001502377650001902392650001202411650003102423650001302454650001902467650002302486650001102509650001602520650001502536650001102551651001402562653002802576653002602604653001502630700002002645700001602665700001702681700001602698700001802714773010102732856008602833852000902919655001202928IND60758207720221122150725.0220103e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075820772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.1084262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPringle, M.J.10aUsing remote sensing to forecast forage quality for cattle in the dry savannas of northeast Australia  aIn the dry savannas of northeast Australia, forage quality is just as important for cattle production as forage quantity. The seasonal trend of forage quality is broadly predictable by land managers, but it is more difficult to predict the point when quality—which depends on local climate, management, and pasture condition—falls below the requirement for animal maintenance. In this study we use statistical modelling to forecast how forage quality might change at the crucial time of year, i.e., as the summer wet season transitions to the dry winter. We do this with the aid of historical information associated with a long-term cattle-grazing trial in the dry savannas. We combined multiple years of two measures of forage quality (dietary crude protein and in vivo dry-matter digestibility; respectively DCP and DMD) and ground cover information (specifically the ratio of ‘green grass’ cover to ‘dead (i.e., non-photosynthetic) grass’ cover, derived from an archive of Landsat satellite imagery) into a linear mixed model that explicitly considered the correlations with time and between variables. DCP and DMD were estimated by near-infrared spectroscopy of fresh faecal samples; values did not have to be temporally coincident with the satellite imagery. With the end of May considered a nominal decision-point, we forecast monthly averages of forage quality for June to August, over a 12-year period at the study site. Over all months and all years, the median absolute error of the forecasts was DCP = 0.86%, and DMD = 0.95%. The remote sensing information served as a correlated, oft-sampled covariate that helped to guide the forecasts of forage quality. We propose summarising the forecasts (and their uncertainty) as a near-real-time graphical tool for decision-support. Such a product could potentially benefit cattle-grazing enterprises in the northeast of Australia, enabling more timely management of herds through the dry season.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3acattle 3acattle production 3aclimate 3acrude protein 3adry matter digestibility 3adry season 3aforage quality 3agrasses 3anear-infrared spectroscopy 3apastures 3aremote sensing 3astatistical models 3asummer 3auncertainty 3awet season 3awinter 3aAustralia 0afaecal NIR spectroscopy 0aPasture digestibility 0aRangelands1 aO'Reagain, P.J.1 aStone, G.S.1 aCarter, J.O.1 aOrton, T.G.1 aBushell, J.J.0 tEcological indicators.g2021 Dec., v. 133 p.108426-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.1084263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02300naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002200145245009800167300001800265520110900283592002801392650000901420650004401429650001001473650001301483650001501496650001401511650001301525650001101538650001301549650001601562650003101578650001001609700002001619700002501639700002201664700002301686773009101709856008101800852000901881655001201890IND4472772220221122233959.0171006e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447277222DNAL7 a10.1007/s10570-011-9584-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSimonović, Jasna10aAnisotropy of cell wall polymers in branches of hardwood and softwood: a polarized FTIR study  ap. 1433-1440.  aThe mechanical and physical properties of wood fibres are dependent on the organisation of their constituent polymers (cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin). Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) microscopy was used to examine the anisotropy of the main wood polymers in isolated cell wall fragments from branches of maple and Serbian spruce. Polarised FTIR measurements indicated an anisotropy, i.e. orientation of the cellulose microfibrils that was more or less parallel to the longitudinal axis of the cell wall. The hemicelluloses, glucomannan and xylan appeared to have a close link to the orientation of the cellulose and, thus, an orientation more parallel to the axis of the cell wall. An important result is that, in both maple and spruce samples, lignin was found to be organised in a parallel way in relation to the longitudinal cell wall axis, as well as to the cellulose. The results show that, despite the different lignin precursors and the different types of hemicelluloses in these two kinds of wood, lignin has a similar orientation, when it comes to the longitudinal axis of the cell wall.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcer 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aPicea 3abranches 3acell walls 3acellulose 3ahardwood 3alignin 3asoftwood 3awood fibers 3awood mechanical properties 3axylan1 aStevanic, Jasna1 aDjikanović, Daniela1 aSalmén, Lennart,1 aRadotić, Ksenija,0 tCellulose.g2011 Dec., v. 18, no. 6 p.1433-1440dSpringer Netherlandsx0969-02397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10570-011-9584-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02419naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001700143245016500160300001400325520110500339592002801444650001201472650001001484650001201494650001501506650002301521650001201544650004401556650001901600653003201619653004001651653005101691653001601742700002301758700001801781773014801799856007701947852000902024655001202033IND60521660520221116214455.0160530e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052166052DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1982-01082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHabben, Carl10aReaktionen von Mehrfachbindungssystemen mit dem 1.2.4-Trithia-3.5-diborolan-Ring / Reactions of Multiple Bond Systems with the 1,2,4-Trithia-3.5-diborolane Ring  ap. 43-53.  a3,5-Dibromo-1,2,4-trithia-3,5-diborolane reacts with alkynes to give ⊿⁴-2-bromo-1,3,2- dithiaborolenes.

Isocyanates and di-i-propylcarbodiimide, respectively, react with 3,5-dimethyl-1,2,4-trithia-3,5-diborolane by formation of 5-methyl-1,4-dithia-2-azacyclopentanethiones(3) or of -pentanones(3). 3,5-Dimethyl-1,2,4-trithia-3,5-diborolane reacts with o-acetylaminophenole to give 3-acetyl-2-methyi-4,5-benzo-l-oxa-3-aza-2-boracyclopentane. ¹H, ¹¹B, ¹³C NMR, mass and IR spectra are reported.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkynes 3aboron 3abromine 3abyproducts 3achemical reactions 3alithium 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aprimary amines 0a⊿4 -1,3,2-Dithiaborolenes 0a⊿2,5 -1,4-Thiaboracyclohexadienes 0a2-Methyl-4-trimethylsilyl-1,3,2-dithiaborolane 0aNMR Spectra1 aMaringgele, Walter1 aMeiler, Anton0 tZeitschrift für Naturforschung.g2014 June 2, v. 37, no. 1 p.43-53dVerlag der Zeitschrift für NaturforschungwJournal:23182x0932-07767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/znb-1982-01083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03513naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245011200165300001600277520191400293592002802207650001902235650001302254650001402267650001502281650002402296650002102320650001402341650001102355650000702366650002102373650001102394650001302405650001202418650001602430650001702446650001102463650001802474651001402492653001502506653001402521653001402535653001702549653001702566653001802583700001202601700001502613700001502628700002002643700001402663700002102677773014302698856008502841852000902926655001202935IND60730551020221118234343.0210813e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073055102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chnaes.2021.02.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRozirwan, 10aAssessment the macrobenthic diversity and community structure in the Musi Estuary, South Sumatra, Indonesia  ap. 346-350.  aThe macrobentic community in the Musi Estuary is very diverse. However, it has been showing a declining trend recently due to an increase in waste from human activities entering the waters. This study aimed to assess the macrobenthic diversity and community structure and correlated to the water quality parameters of the Musi Estuary, South Sumatra. The method used was a survey collecting water quality parameters at eight observation stations. The salinity is measured with a refractometer, temperature is measured with a digital thermometer, pH is measured with a pH meter. The dissolved oxygen (DO), brightness and current are measured with a DO meter, Seichii disk, and current meter, respectively. The Ekman grab was used to collect the samples, and then we used a diversity index, a similarity index, and principal components analysis (PCA) for analysis. The results show that the water quality is found in a good condition for macrobenthos growths. The salinity is ranging between 0 and 15 ppt, temperature is about 29–30.8 °C, pH is about 7.6–8.1, the dissolved oxygen is found to be 3.2–12.5 mg/L, the brightness is about 4.71–31.67% and the current speed is about 0.02–0.08 m.s⁻¹. The analysis also indicates that the microbenthic compositions consist of 18 species, which is grouped into five classes, namely Gastropods 56%, Crustacea 22%, Bivalve 11%, Actinopterygii 6%, and Polychaeta 5%, with an abundance of 0,67 to 13,33 Ind.m⁻². The diversity index is generally in low categories (H′ < 1), and the dominance index is more than 0.5. Based on the PCA analysis, it was found that the water quality parameters (e.g. dissolved oxygen and temperature) show significant correlation with similarity index at all observation stations. The macrobenthic diversity and community structure in the Musi Estuary is found to be increasing offshore and decreasing towards the river.  aPublisher supplied data 3aActinopterygii 3aBivalvia 3aCrustacea 3aPolychaeta 3acommunity structure 3adissolved oxygen 3aestuaries 3ahumans 3apH 3arefractive index 3arivers 3asalinity 3asurveys 3atemperature 3athermometers 3awastes 3awater quality 3aIndonesia 0aAssessment 0aDiversity 0aGastropod 0aMacrobenthos 0aMusi estuary 0aWater quality1 aMelki, 1 aApri, Rezi1 aFauziyah, 1 aAgussalim, Andi1 aHartoni, 1 aIskandar, Iskhaq0 tActa ecologica Sinica.g2021 Aug., v. 41, no. 4 p.346-350dElsevier B.V.aEcological Society of ChinawJournal:J000000040x1872-20327nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chnaes.2021.02.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02097naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001600144245011800160300001600278520082000294592002801114650002201142650002101164650001601185650003801201650001201239650001901251650001301270651001901283651003101302653001501333653002001348653001301368653001001381700002501391700002201416700003001438773013201468856007801600852000901678655001201687IND60743108320221121002313.0210707e20210705xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074310832DNAL7 a10.7589/JWD-D-20-000912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHouck, Emma10aSeroprevalence of Sarcoptes scabiei in Free-Ranging Black Bears (Ursus americanus) in Eastern North Carolina, USA  ap. 628-631.  aRecent sarcoptic mange epizootics have affected free-ranging black bears (Ursus americanus) in the northeastern US, but not in North Carolina. To determine whether black bears in eastern North Carolina have exposure to Sarcoptes scabiei, serum samples from hunter-harvested black bears (n=45) were collected and evaluated for antibodies using a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay previously validated in black bears. No dermal lesions consistent with sarcoptic mange were identified in the sampled bears. The seroprevalence among these asymptomatic bears was 18%, with no significant difference between sexes or association with age. This suggests that exposure to Sarcoptes scabiei occurs within the population, and highlights the importance of serosurveys in regions without a history of clinical mange.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSarcoptes scabiei 3aUrsus americanus 3ablood serum 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3ascabies 3aseroprevalence 3awildlife 3aNorth Carolina 3aNortheastern United States 0aBlack bear 0asarcoptic mange 0aserology 0aursid1 aOlfenbuttel, Colleen1 aStoskopf, Michael1 aKennedy-Stoskopf, Suzanne0 tJournal of wildlife diseases.g2021 July 5, v. 57, no. 3 p.628-631dWildlife Disease AssociationwJournal:1978x0090-35587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.7589/JWD-D-20-000913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03938naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001600138245016000154520282100314592002803135650003603163650001303199650001403212650001103226650001503237650002403252650001403276650001803290650001603308650001003324651001003334700001603344700001503360773012003375856007203495852000903567655001203576IND60648808920221120195731.0190701e20171117xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064880892DNAL7 a10.3390/f81104462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Yunxia10aUsing Linear Mixed-Effects Models with Quantile Regression to Simulate the Crown Profile of Planted <em>Pinus sylvestris</em> var. <em>Mongolica</em> Trees  aCrown profile is mostly related to the competition of individual trees in the stands, light interception, growth, and yield of trees. A total of 76 sample trees with a total number of 889 whorls and 3658 live branches were used to develop the outer crown profile model of the planted Pinus sylvestris var. mongolica trees in Heilongjiang Province, China. The power-exponential equation, modified Kozak equation, and simple polynomial equation were used and the model which showed the best performance was used as the basic model. The dummy variable approach was used to analyze the effect of stand age and stand density on the crown profile. Quantile regression for linear mixed-effects model, where the correlations between the series measurements on the same subject were considered, was used to model the outer crown profile. The results indicated that the power-exponential equation had the smallest error and was used as the basic model. Based on the dummy variable approach, stand age and stand density showed significant effects on the crown profile on the whole. Thus, they were directly included into the linear form of the power-exponential equation by a natural logarithm transformation to develop the quantile regression for the linear mixed-effects model. The 0.95th quantile regression model performed best in modeling the outer crown profile when compared to other quantiles. The prediction accuracy of the 0.95th quantile regression model by adding the random effects increased when compared to the quantile regression without random effect. The quantile regression for the linear mixed-effects model also showed an excellent performance in the largest crown radius prediction when compared to the quantile regression model. From suppressed trees to dominant trees, the crown radius increased, with tree size increasing for the same stand age and stand density increases. The crown radius of the suppressed trees from 21 to 40 year stands was the largest and the smallest was from older (>40 years) stands. The crown radius for both the intermediate and dominant trees from 21 to 40 year stands were similar and were larger than the younger (10–20 years) stands. The crown radius increased with tree size when the stand variables were constant. Furthermore, the crown radius increased with the increase of stand age, decreased with increasing stand density, and decreased with increased ratio of tree height to diameter at the breast height (HD) for trees with the same tree variables. Stand density had a weaker effect on the crown profile when compared to the HD. The growth rate of the crown radius of planted Pinus sylvestris var. mongolica trees increased with increasing stand age, and decreased with decreasing stand density. The growth rate of the crown radius decreased with increasing HD.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus sylvestris var. mongolica 3abranches 3aequations 3amodels 3aprediction 3aregression analysis 3astand age 3astand density 3atree height 3atrees 3aChina1 aGao, Huilin1 aLi, Fengri0 tForests.g2017 Nov. 17, v. 8, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f81104463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02856naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245011800167300001600285520129900301592002801600650001501628650002401643650002101667650002801688650002401716650001701740650001701757650001901774650000901793650000901802650001101811653001401822653001101836653002401847653001701871653002001888653002101908700001301929700001501942700001801957700001801975700001701993700005202010700005802062773013402120856008702254852000902341655001202350IND60629093820221120153826.0200628e20190501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062909382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2019.01.1462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShi, Yixin10aSynthesis of N-doped carbon quantum dots from bio-waste lignin for selective irons detection and cellular imaging  ap. 537-545.  aFacile synthesis of carbon quantum dots with high fluorescence and excellent biocompatibility from plentiful and biocompatible materials still attracts much attention because of their great potential value in sensors and imaging. In this study, a highly fluorescent and super biocompatible N-doped carbon quantum dots derived from green precursor of aminated alkali lignin has been synthesized for cellular imaging. The amine-rich lignin carbon quantum dots (AL-CQDs) was firstly synthesized by introduction of secondary amine groups into lignin backbones via both Mannich and Machael addition reaction. The resulted AL-CQDs within the range of 4–10 nm exhibited excitation-dependent and pH-stable fluorescence properties and was employed for the detection of irons with a wide range from 100 nM to 1 mM and a low detection limit of 8 nM, in which the Fe³⁺ ions could be captured by the amine groups of the AL-CQDs to form an absorbent complex, resulting in a significant fluorescence quenching. Meanwhile, the AL-CQDs were successfully applied to cell imaging and intracellular irons detection benefited from low cytotoxicity and good biocompatibility. This work would shed much light on converting agricultural waste into bio-based nanomaterials and their potential applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorbents 3aagricultural wastes 3abiocompatibility 3abiocompatible materials 3acarbon quantum dots 3acytotoxicity 3afluorescence 3aimage analysis 3aions 3airon 3alignin 0aAmination 0aLignin 0aCarbon quantum dots 0aFluorescence 0aIrons detection 0aCellular imaging1 aLiu, Xin1 aWang, Meng1 aHuang, Jianbo1 aJiang, Xueqin1 aPang, Jinhui1 aXu, Feng1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2893-49671 aZhang, Xueming1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5352-86160 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2019 May 01, v. 128 p.537-545dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2019.01.1463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02587naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005400094040001800148100002400166245016800190300001400358520143300372592002801805653001501833653001301848653001401861653002501875700002401900700002501924700002001949700002401969700002301993773012202016856011402138852000902252655001202261IND60130339920221118231352.0151127e200704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013033992DNAL7 a10.2983/0730-8000(2007)26[25:PRANSS]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMAHIDOL, CHULABHORN10aPhylogenetic relationships among nine scallop species (bivalvia: pectinidae) inferred from nucleotide sequences of one mitochondrial and three nuclear gene regions  ap. 25-32.  aCurrent knowledge of the evolutionary relationships among scallop species (Mollusca: Bivalvia: Pectinidae) in the Indo-Pacific region is rather scanty. To enhance the understanding of the relationships within this group, phylogenies of nine species of scallops with the majority from coastal regions of Thailand, were reconstructed by maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian methods using sequences of the 16S rRNA of the mitochondrial genome, and a fragment containing the ITS1, 5.8S and ITS2 genes of the nuclear DNA. The trees that resulted from the three methods of analysis were topologically identical, however, gained different levels of support at some nodes. Nine species were clustered into two major clades, corresponding to two subfamilies (Pectininae and Chlamydinae) of the three currently recognized subfamilies within Pectinidae. Overall, the relationships reported herein are mostly in accordance with the previous molecular studies that used sequences of the mtDNA cytochrome oxidase subunit I, and the classification system based on microsculpture of shell features and morphological characteristics of juveniles. Levels of divergences were different among genes (i.e., the 5.8S gene showed the lowest levels of nucleotide divergence at all levels, whereas the 16S rRNA showed the highest level of variation within species, and ITS2 gene revealed the highest level of divergence at higher levels).  aPublisher supplied data 0aPectinidae 0ascallops 0aphylogeny 0anucleotide sequences1 aNA-NAKORN, UTHAIRAT1 aSUKMANOMON, SRIJANYA1 aYOOSUK, WANTANA1 aTANIGUCHI, NOBUHIKO1 aNGUYEN, THUY T.

Furthermore, they could be readily processed into nanofibers with reversibly photoswitchable fluorescence by electrospinning. They can be potentially applied in fabricating microdevice, optical switching, information storage, anti-counterfeiting as well as biological imaging.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon nanoparticles 3acomposite polymers 3afluorescence 3aimage analysis 3airradiation 3ananofibers 3astyrene1 aWang, Wu1 aLong, Peng1 aDeng, Xiaoting1 aHe, Benqiao1 aLiu, Qingquan1 aYi, Shoujun0 tCarbon.g2015 Sept., v. 91 p.30-37dElsevier Ltdx0008-62237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2015.04.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03657naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100002400191245011900215246005000334506007600384520198100460592002802441506003702469650001902506650001502525650002102540650001402561650001002575650002802585650000902613650002002622650001302642650000902655650002002664650001802684650001402702650001602716650002102732651001302753700002402766700002702790700002102817700002002838700002502858700001902883700002602902773007302928856008403001961000903085852000903094655001203103IND60121620020221207115839.0150316e20130304xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012162002DNAL7 a10.1371/journal.pone.00586302doi7 aPMC35875802pmcid7 a234840432pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWyckoff, A.

Prions are known to associate with clay and other soil components, enhancing their persistence and surprisingly, transmissibility. Currently, few detection and quantification methods exist for prions in soil, hindering an understanding of prion persistence and infectivity in the environment. Variability in apparent infectious titers of prions when bound to soil has complicated attempts to quantify the binding capacity of soil for prion infectivity. Here, we quantify the prion adsorption capacity of whole, sandy loam soil (SLS) typically found in CWD endemic areas in Colorado; and purified montmorillonite clay (Mte), previously shown to bind prions, by BioAssay of Subtracted Infectivity in Complex Solutions (BASICS). We incubated prion positive 10% brain homogenate from terminally sick mice infected with the Rocky Mountain Lab strain of mouse-adapted prions (RML) with 10% SLS or Mte. After 24 hours samples were centrifuged five minutes at 200×g and soil-free supernatant was intracerebrally inoculated into prion susceptible indicator mice. We used the number of days post inoculation to clinical disease to calculate the infectious titer remaining in the supernatant, which we subtracted from the starting titer to determine the infectious prion binding capacity of SLS and Mte. BASICS indicated SLS bound and removed ≥ 95% of infectivity. Mte bound and removed lethal doses (99.98%) of prions from inocula, effectively preventing disease in the mice. Our data reveal significant prion-binding capacity of soil and the utility of BASICS to estimate prion loads and investigate persistence and decomposition in the environment. Additionally, since Mte successfully rescued the mice from prion disease, Mte might be used for remediation and decontamination protocols.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPrPSc proteins 3aadsorption 3abinding capacity 3abioassays 3abrain 3achronic wasting disease 3aclay 3adecontamination 3ainoculum 3amice 3amontmorillonite 3apathogenicity 3apathogens 3aremediation 3asandy loam soils 3aColorado1 aLockwood, Krista L.1 aMeyerett-Reid, Crystal1 aMichel, Brady A.1 aBender, Heather1 aVerCauteren, Kurt C.1 aZabel, Mark D.1 aFujinami, Robert Shin0 tPloS one.g, v. 8, no. 3dPublic Library of Sciencex1932-62037nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.00586303Available from publisher's site  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle02470naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001700144245014300161300001600304520096200320592002801282650003501310650001501345650001901360650001201379650001001391650001801401650000701419650001701426650001301443650002201456650001601478650001401494650001301508653001201521653002501533653001501558653001401573653001401587653002801601653001501629653001201644653002001656700001801676700002001694700001901714773013201733856007801865852000901943655001201952IND60743108420221121013855.0210707e20210705xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074310842DNAL7 a10.7589/JWD-D-20-001052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTurner, Anna10aTemperature as a driver of the pathogenicity and virulence of amphibian chytrid fungus batrachochytrium dendrobatidis: a systematic review  ap. 477-494.  aChytridiomycosis, caused by the chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), is a leading cause of global amphibian declines. Severe infections with Bd can lead to cardiac arrest, and mass deaths during epidemics have been reported. Temperature, pH, salinity, and moisture are important determinants of the survival, growth, reproduction, and pathogenicity of Bd, as well as its effect on amphibian populations. Here, we synthesize current knowledge on the role of temperature as a driver of the pathogenicity and virulence of Bd to better understand the effects of temperature on amphibian defense mechanisms against infection. This review advises on research direction and management approaches to benefit amphibian populations affected by Bd. We conclude by offering guidelines for four levels of temperature monitoring in amphibian field studies to improve consistency between studies: regional climate, habitat, microhabitat, and amphibian host.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBatrachochytrium dendrobatidis 3aamphibians 3acardiac arrest 3aclimate 3afungi 3amicrohabitats 3apH 3areproduction 3asalinity 3asystematic review 3atemperature 3avirulence 3awildlife 0aDisease 0aenvironmental refuge 0afreshwater 0aguideline 0aintensity 0akey threatening process 0aprevalence 0athermal 0awildlife health1 aWassens, Skye1 aHeard, Geoffrey1 aPeters, Andrew0 tJournal of wildlife diseases.g2021 July 5, v. 57, no. 3 p.477-494dWildlife Disease AssociationwJournal:1978x0090-35587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.7589/JWD-D-20-001053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03239naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245017100163300001600334520150600350592002801856650001101884650003501895650001501930650001601945650002101961650001001982650001101992650001402003650001102017650001902028650002002047650001502067650001002082651001502092651001802107653001802125653002102143653002402164653003602188653002902224653003702253700005302290700001502343700001702358700001402375700001602389700001702405700001502422700001602437700001702453773010002470856008202570852000902652655001202661IND60544601620221118034624.0190417e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054460162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ejrh.2014.12.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDailey, D.10aGeophysical, remote sensing, GIS, and isotopic applications for a better understanding of the structural controls on groundwater flow in the Mojave Desert, California  ap. 211-232.  aMojave Desert, USA.An integrated (near-surface geophysics, remote sensing, isotopic analyses) study was conducted in the Mojave River Basin and Morongo Groundwater Basin to investigate potential effects that the Helendale Fault [HF] and basement uplifts might have on groundwater flow in the Mojave Desert.The HF traces were mapped using LiDAR and Geoeye-1 imagery (surface) and magnetic profiles (subsurface). Shallow basement parallel to and west of the HF was detected using the Vertical Electrical Soundings (VESs). Conductive water-saturated breccia was detected along the HF using the Very Low Frequency (VLF) electromagnetic measurements. Isotopic analyses (δD and δ18O) for groundwater samples from productive shallow wells, and springs sampled west of the HF and the basement uplift are less depleted (Group I: Fifteenmile Valley Groundwater sub-basin [FVGS]; average δD: −86.8‰; δ18O: −11.8‰) than samples east of the basement uplift (Group II: Lucerne Valley Groundwater sub-basin [LVGS]; average δD: −95.0‰; δ18O: −12.1‰), whereas samples proximal to, the fault have compositions similar to Group I but show evidence for mixing with Group II compositions (Group III; average δD: −88.8‰; δ18O: −11.5‰). Findings are consistent with the HF channeling groundwater from the San Bernardino Mountains with basement uplifts acting as barriers to lateral groundwater flow and could be applicable to similar settings across the Mojave Desert and elsewhere worldwide.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3ageographic information systems 3ageophysics 3agroundwater 3agroundwater flow 3alidar 3amixing 3amountains 3aoxygen 3aremote sensing 3asprings (water) 3awatersheds 3awells 3aCalifornia 3aMojave Desert 0aMojave desert 0aGroundwater flow 0aStructural controls 0aGeophysics (VLF, Magnetic, VES) 0aIsotopic analyses (O, H) 0aRemote sensing (LiDAR, GeoEye-1)1 aSauck, W.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2911-30441 aSultan, M.1 aMilewski, A.1 aAhmed, M.1 aLaton, W.R.1 aElkadiri, R.1 aFoster, J.1 aSchmidt, C.1 aAl Harbi, T.0 tJournal of hydrology.g2015 Mar., v. 3 p.211-232dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23229x2214-58187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrh.2014.12.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02983naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005100092040001800143100001900161245008200180300001800262500000900280500001500289520184900304592002802153650002202181650001902203650002302222650001602245650001002261650001502271650002002286650001502306650002102321653001602342700002102358773012302379852000902502856009802511655001202609IND2039477120221119002303.0191122e199311  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203947712DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci1993.0011183X003300060015x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKnapp, Eric E.10aOutcrossing Rates of Alfalfa Populations Differing in Ease of Floret Tripping  ap. 1181-1185.  aepub  a2019-12-04  aBreeding alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) with florets that are easier for honey bees (Apis mellifera L.) to trip has been proposed as a means of increasing the efficiency of pollination and improving seed yield, but the impact of selection for ease of tripping on the mating system is not known. This study was conducted to evaluate ease of tripping, self-fertility, and outcrossing rate of alfalfa populations selected for ease of tripping. Easy-to-trip, hard-to-trip, and ‘CUF101’ parent populations were planted in a randomized complete block design with three replicates at Davis, CA. Ease of tripping of the populations was measured, self-fertility evaluated, and open-pollinated seed harvested in each of two years. The mode of inheritance of the Peroxidase-2 and Fluorescent Esterase-1 allozyme loci was verified. Allozyme genotype at these two loci was determined for progeny arrays grown from the open-pollinated seed, and the data used to calculate outcrossing rate of each population using multilocus maximum likelihood estimation procedures. The easy-to-trip population was easier to trip and the hard-to-trip population was harder to trip than the unselected parent population. Self-fertility did not differ among populations. Both Peroxidase-2 and Fluorescent Esterase-I segregated as expected for monomeric enzymes at single tetrasomic loci. The outcrossing rate of the easy-to-trip population (0.76) did not differ from the outcrossing rate of the hard-to-trip population (0.75) or the CUF101 parent population (0.77). Selection for ease of tripping is an easily utilized indirect method which may improve alfalfa seed yield and does not alter the proportion of self-pollinated seed produced.

During this period the relationship of fiber length to seed volume in each cultivar fit the model L = βVᵅ ~ with R² = 0.99, where L = fiber length, V = seed volume, and α and β are the growth parameters. The α value in each was near 0.5, indicating tbat seed volume was increasing as the square of fiber length. This relationship suggests that biological partitioning of available resources within the cotton plant controls some agronomically important parameters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aplant physiology 3aplant biochemistry 3afield crops1 aKerr, Thomas0 tCrop science.g1974 Jan., v. 14, no. 1 p.118-120dCrop Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44570x0011-183X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2135/cropsci1974.0011183X001400010036x3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02451naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245010900155300002000264520121800284592002801502650001101530650001901541650001401560650002301574650001301597650001801610650001201628650001801640650001101658650001301669650002101682650001301703700001901716700001801735700001901753700001501772700001601787773014301803856007401946852000902020655001202029IND60671151520221118192337.0191002e20150804xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067115152DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ta03565a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDai, Tian,10aHollow zeolite encapsulated Ni–Pt bimetals for sintering and coking resistant dry reforming of methane  ap. 16461-16468.  aHighly dispersed Ni–Pt bimetallic nanoparticles encapsulated in hollow silicalite-1 single crystals (1.5Ni–0.5Pt@Hol S-1) were a superior catalyst for sintering and coking resistant dry (CO₂) reforming of CH₄. Large Ni particles loaded on the surface of solid silicalite-1 crystals triggered coke formation, which simultaneously degraded the catalytic activity of small Ni particles. With Ni encapsulated in hollow crystals, the small Ni particles inhibited coke formation. The encapsulating shell prevented coke formed outside from degrading the activity of nickel on the inside, leading to stable high activity even in the presence of carbon. Compared with single metals (Ni or Pt), 1.5Ni–0.5Pt@Hol S-1 enhanced the dispersion of nickel and platinum. In the dry reforming of methane, the 1.5Ni–0.5Pt@Hol S-1 catalyst operated stably under high gaseous hourly space velocity (GHSV = 72 000 ml g⁻¹ h⁻¹) without any inert gas. Only 1.0 wt% carbon deposition was observed by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) after 6 h of the reaction. Hollow zeolite crystals can reliably support coke resistant catalysts for dry reforming of CH₄ and multi-metallic catalysts with well-dispersed nanoparticles.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acrystals 3aencapsulation 3amethane 3ananoparticles 3anickel 3aplatinum 3athermogravimetry 3azeolites1 aZhang, Shaohua1 aZhang, Anfeng1 aSong, Chunshan1 aShi, Chuan1 aGuo, Xinwen0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2015 Aug. 4, v. 3, no. 32 p.16461-16468dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ta03565a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02310naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001300148245013500161300001400296520104700310592002801357650001201385650001101397650001401408650002301422650001801445650001401463650001101477653000801488653001501496653001401511653002701525653001601552700001501568700001701583700001401600700001501614700001501629700001901644773012101663856008301784852000901867655001201876IND60733943420221120095243.0210513e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073394342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2021.03.1562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Yang14aThe behavior of surface acidity on photo-Fenton degradation of ciprofloxacin over sludge derived carbon: Performance and mechanism  ap. 84-93.  aSludge derived carbon (SC) has been widely used in advanced oxidation processes as an effective and economic catalyst. In this study, we applied surface modified SC for the first time to catalyze the heterogeneous photo-Fenton process with ciprofloxacin, a highly concerned emerging contaminant, as a model substance. H₂SO₄ was used to acidify the SCs under varying acid dosages, temperatures, and reaction time lengths. The surface acidity of SCs was quantitatively characterized with NH₃-TPD. A strong correlation between the surface acidity and the catalytic activity was clearly demonstrated. The highest catalytic activity was obtained with SC whose acidity was 0.149 mmol·g⁻¹ after being modified with 6 mol·L⁻¹ H₂SO₄ at −20 ℃ for 24 h. In addition, XRD, XRF, BET, XPS, and HRTEM were also used to characterize the obtained SC. ·OH radicals were found to be the main reactive species by EPR. Ten transformation products were identified by GC–MS, based on which three possible reaction pathways were proposed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidity 3acarbon 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3aciprofloxacin 3aoxidation 3asludge 0aAOP 0aWastewater 0aOxidation 0aHeterogeneous catalyst 0aAntibiotics1 aSun, Yifei1 aZhou, Yuanbo1 aXu, Anlin1 aXu, Yanhua1 aHuang, Fei1 aZhang, Yongjun0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2021 Sept., v. 597 p.84-93dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2021.03.1563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02727naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002000137245008100157300001600238520159100254592002801845650001101873650001501884650002501899650000901924650001101933650001401944650001201958650001401970650002201984650000902006650001102015650001602026650001802042650001602060650000902076651002402085700002002109773009602129856007102225852000902296655001202305IND60518470220221119005024.0160417e196701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051847022DNAL7 a10.2307/19334302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFitch, Henry S.10aPreliminary Experiments on Physical Tolerances of Eggs of Lizards and Snakes  ap. 160-165.  aIn lizards and snakes the egg is a vulnerable stage in the life cycle with limitations that must often restrict geographic range or local occurrence of a species. Eggs of the rat snake, racer, ring—necked snake, Great Plains skink and five—linked skink were exposed in mixed groups to various controlled conditions of temperature and humidity to determine some of the differences between species in their ranges of tolerance. In atmospheres of 60 to 90% relative humidity eggs of all kinds tested lost water rapidly over periods of days and were short—lived. Mold contributed to mortality. At higher humidities survival was prolonged. At 97.5% relative humidity eggs dehydrated slowly but sometimes survived for several weeks and produced normal hatchlings. The small, thin—shelled eggs of ring—necked snakes deteriorated much more rapidly than eggs of the other species tested, and those of the racer were most resistant. In incubation media of decaying wood, loamy humans, crushed limestone and sand, with water content of 2 to 68%, eggs of all kinds tested gained weight by absorption of moisture and most eventually hatched. Gains in weight were gradual and were not proportional to the moisture content of the medium. For all species tested the eggs were eury—thermal with limits of tolerance near 41@?C and lower limits near the freezing point, but there were minor differences between species, and for the ring—necked snake the range of tolerance was several degrees narrower that it was for the skinks. For the egg, temperature is much less limiting than moisture.  aPublisher supplied data 3aElaphe 3aabsorption 3adevelopmental stages 3aeggs 3ahumans 3alimestone 3alizards 3amortality 3arelative humidity 3asand 3asnakes 3atemperature 3awater content 3aweight gain 3awood 3aGreat Plains region1 aFitch, Alice V.0 tEcology.g1967 Jan., v. 48, no. 1 p.160-165dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2307/19334303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03271naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003900113040001800152100001600170245017900186300001600365520109900381592002801480650003701508650002701545650002601572650001801598650001501616650001801631650001001649650001901659650002501678650001001703650000701713650001901720650002001739650002401759650001201783650004001795650001701835650002201852650003201874650004601906650004101952650003201993650002802025650005102053650002402104650002002128650004002148651001102188653003702199653001602236653001202252653001302264653002002277700001802297700002002315700001702335700001602352700002102368773010102389856008602490852000902576655001202585IND50060420820221120041734.0190402e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006042082DNAL7 a232734712pmid7 a10.1016/j.meatsci.2012.11.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBiscola, V.10aIsolation and characterization of a nisin-like bacteriocin produced by a Lactococcus lactis strain isolated from charqui, a Brazilian fermented, salted and dried meat product  ap. 607-613.  aA Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis strain (L. lactis 69) capable to produce a heat-stable bacteriocin was isolated from charqui, a Brazilian fermented, salted and sun-dried meat product. The bacteriocin inhibited, in vitro, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, several lactic acid bacteria isolated from foods and spoilage halotolerant bacteria isolated from charqui. The activity of the bacteriocin was not affected by pH (2.0–10.0), heating (100°C), and chemical agents (1% w/v). Treatment of growing cells of L. monocytogenes ScottA with the cell-free supernatant of L. lactis 69 resulted in complete cell inactivation. L. lactis 69 harbored the gene for the production of a nisin-like bacteriocin, and the amino acid sequence of the active peptide was identical to sequences previously described for nisin Z. However, differences were observed regarding the leader peptide. Besides, the isolate was able to survive and produce bacteriocins in culture medium with NaCl content up to 20%, evidencing a potential application as an additional hurdle in the preservation of charqui.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLactococcus lactis subsp. lactis 3aListeria monocytogenes 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aculture media 3adried meat 3afood spoilage 3agenes 3aheat treatment 3alactic acid bacteria 3anisin 3apH 3asignal peptide 3asodium chloride 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aAnti-Bacterial Agentsxpharmacology 2aFermentation 2aFood Microbiology 2aLactobacillusxdrug effects 2aLactococcus lactisxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aListeria monocytogenesxdrug effects 2aMeat Productsxmicrobiology 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aNisinxisolation & purificationxpharmacology. 2aPeptidesxchemistry 2aSalt Tolerance. 2aStaphylococcus aureusxdrug effects 0aBrazil 0aLactococcus lactis subsp. lactis 0aBacteriocin 0aCharqui 0aSpoilage 0aBiopreservation1 aTodorov, S.D.1 aCapuano, V.S.C.1 aAbriouel, H.1 aGálvez, A.1 aFranco, B.D.G.M.0 tMeat science.g2013 Mar., v. 93, no. 3 p.607-613dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8541x0309-17407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meatsci.2012.11.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01363naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001800138245013800156300001800294520035700312592002800669650002200697650002300719650001100742700013300753773012900886856007301015852000901088655001201097IND60658320120221119230326.0190817e20081120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065832012DNAL7 a10.1039/b812306c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCraig, Donald12aA quantitative structure–reactivity relationship in decarboxylative Claisen rearrangement reactions of allylic tosylmalonate esters  ap. 6054-6056.  aFirst-order rate constants have been determined for the decarboxylative Claisen rearrangement reactions at 293 K of substituted methyl (E)-3-phenyl-2-propenyl 2-tosylmalonate esters, which show a linear free-energy relationship indicative of the development of positive charge on the benzylic position in the sigmatropic rearrangement transition-state.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGibbs free energy 3achemical reactions 3aesters1 aSlavovPresent address: Institut für Organische Chemie, Universität zu Köln, Greinstrasse 4, 50939 Köln, Germany., Nikolay K.0 tChemical communications.g2008 Nov. 20, , no. 45 p.6054-6056dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b812306c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03134naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094024002200136024001900158040001800177100001900195245017300214300002100387520168100408592002802089650002202117650001102139650002402150650001302174650001402187650002602201650001502227650001302242650001702255650002002272650001102292650001002303651001802313700002302331700002602354700002002380700002102400700002202421773010102443856008802544990002302632852000902655655001202664IND60098569220221120191202.0141104e201111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009856922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fertnstert.2011.08.0392doi7 aPMC32781612pmcid7 a219586902pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKarmon, Anatte10aAssociation of ethnicity with involuntary childlessness and perceived reasons for infertility: baseline data from the Study of Women’s Health Across the Nation (SWAN)  ap. 1200-1205.e1.  aOBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether ethnicity is associated with involuntary childlessness and perceived reasons for difficulties in becoming pregnant. DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis of baseline data from a longitudinal cohort. SETTING: Multiethnic, community-based observational study of US women. PATIENT(S): Women in midlife (3,149), aged 42–52 years. INTERVENTION(S): None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Involuntary childlessness and perceived etiology of infertility. RESULT(S): One hundred thirty-three subjects (4.2%) were involuntarily childless, defined by a reported history of infertility and nulliparity. Ethnicity was significantly associated with self-reported involuntary childlessness. After controlling for economic and other risk factors, African American (odds ratio [OR] 0.30; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.15–0.59) and Chinese women (OR 0.36; 95% CI 0.14–0.90) were less likely to suffer from involuntary childlessness compared with non-Hispanic white women. In addition, 302 subjects reported a perceived etiology of infertility. An unexpectedly large proportion of these women (24.5%, 74 of 302) reported etiologies not known to cause infertility (i.e., tipped uterus, ligaments for tubes were stretched), with African American women having been most likely to report these etiologies (OR 2.81; 95% CI 1.26–6.28) as the reason for not becoming pregnant. CONCLUSION(S): Ethnicity is significantly associated with involuntary childlessness and perceived etiology of infertility. Misattribution of causes of infertility is common and merits further consideration with respect to language or cultural barriers, as well as possible physician misattribution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAfrican Americans 3aWhites 3aconfidence interval 3aetiology 3aligaments 3aobservational studies 3aodds ratio 3apatients 3arisk factors 3asocial barriers 3auterus 3awomen 3aUnited States1 aHailpern, Susan M.1 aNeal-Perry, Genevieve1 aGreen, Robin R.1 aSantoro, Nanette1 aPolotsky, Alex J.0 tFertility and sterility.g2011 Nov., v. 96, no. 5 p.1200-1205.e1dElsevier Inc.x0015-02827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fertnstert.2011.08.0393Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03579naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100001700191245011500208246003400323500001500357506007600372520191900448592002802367506003702395650002602432650001602458650001102474650002602485650001402511650005202525650001302577650001002590650002502600650001902625650001902644650003102663650001302694653001302707700001202720700001302732700002102745700001402766700001702780700001802797700001702815700001802832773007302850856008402923961000903007852000903016655001203025IND60121620120221207130148.0150316e20130319xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012162012DNAL7 a10.1371/journal.pone.00593582doi7 aPMC36019602pmcid7 a235271722pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHou, Hongmin10aGenomic Organization, Phylogenetic Comparison and Differential Expression of the SBP-Box Family Genes in Grape3 aSBP-Box Family Genes in Grape  a2019-12-04  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe SBP-box gene family is specific to plants and encodes a class of zinc finger-containing transcription factors with a broad range of functions. Although SBP-box genes have been identified in numerous plants including green algae, moss, silver birch, snapdragon, Arabidopsis , rice and maize, there is little information concerning SBP-box genes, or the corresponding miR156/157 , function in grapevine. Eighteen SBP-box gene family members were identified in Vitis vinifera , twelve of which bore sequences that were complementary to miRNA156/157 . Phylogenetic reconstruction demonstrated that plant SBP-domain proteins could be classified into seven subgroups, with the V. vinifera SBP-domain proteins being more closely related to SBP-domain proteins from dicotyledonous angiosperms than those from monocotyledonous angiosperms. In addition, synteny analysis between grape and Arabidopsis demonstrated that homologs of several grape SBP genes were found in corresponding syntenic blocks of Arabidopsis . Expression analysis of the grape SBP-box genes in various organs and at different stages of fruit development in V. quinquangularis ‘Shang-24’ revealed distinct spatiotemporal patterns. While the majority of the grape SBP-box genes lacking a miR156/157 target site were expressed ubiquitously and constitutively, most genes bearing a miR156/157 target site exhibited distinct expression patterns, possibly due to the inhibitory role of the microRNA. Furthermore, microarray data mining and quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis identified several grape SBP-box genes that are potentially involved in the defense against biotic and abiotic stresses. The results presented here provide a further understanding of SBP-box gene function in plants, and yields additional insights into the mechanism of stress management in grape, which may have important implications for the future success of this crop.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3atranscription factors 3aArabidopsis 3agrapes 3amicroarray technology 3aphylogeny 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3amicroRNA 3agenes 3anucleotide sequences 3aabiotic stress 3aVitis vinifera 3agene expression regulation 3afruiting 0aproteins1 aLi, Jun1 aGao, Min1 aSinger, Stacy D.1 aWang, Hao1 aMao, Linyong1 aFei, Zhangjun1 aWang Xiping,1 aUnver, Turgay0 tPloS one.g, v. 8, no. 3dPublic Library of Sciencex1932-62037nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.00593583Available from publisher's site  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle02809naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245008600162300002000248520132600268592002801594650002301622650002201645650001301667650001401680650001101694650001101705650002201716650001301738650001301751650002201764650001401786650001501800650001801815650001801833650002101851650001601872700001501888700001201903700003001915700001701945700001901962700002501981700001702006700001902023700002302042773014302065856007402208852000902282655001202291IND60671151620221118192434.0191002e20150707xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067115162DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ta03570h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBijelić, Mirjana10aLong cycle life of CoMn₂O₄ lithium ion battery anodes with high crystallinity  ap. 14759-14767.  aCoMn₂O₄ nanomaterials are prepared by a low temperature precipitation route employing metal acetates and NaOH. Structural changes, induced by different annealing temperatures, are comprehensively analyzed by X-ray powder diffraction and Raman spectroscopy. With rising annealing temperature the crystal lattice of CoMn₂O₄ undergoes changes; AO₄ tetrahedra expand due to thermally induced substitution of Co²⁺ by larger Mn²⁺ metal ions on the A-site of the spinel structure, while in contrast, BO₆ octahedra shrink since the B-site becomes partially occupied by smaller Co³⁺ metal ions on account of the migrated Mn ions. CoMn₂O₄ particle sizes are easily fine-tuned by applying different annealing temperatures; the particle size increases with increasing annealing temperature. During the battery operation, pulverization and reduction of particle sizes occurs regardless of the initial size of the particles, but the degree of division of the particles during the operation is dependent on the initial particle properties. Thus, contrary to the common assumption that nanostructuring of the anode material improves the battery performance, samples with the largest particle sizes exhibit excellent performance with a capacity retention of 104% after 1000 cycles (compared to the 2ⁿᵈ cycle).  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aacetates 3aannealing 3aanodes 3acobalt 3acrystal structure 3ageometry 3agrinding 3alithium batteries 3amanganese 3ametal ions 3ananomaterials 3aparticle size 3asodium hydroxide 3atemperature1 aLiu, Xiang1 aSun, Q.1 aDjurišić, Aleksandra B.1 aXie, Mao Hai1 aNg, Alan M.

Mitochondria are important organelle involved in ATP production and are the center of energy metabolism. In this work, we firstly investigated the effect of HACC on the thermogenic curve of isolated mitochondrial metabolism by microcalorimetry. The results showed that different concentration of HACC had great influence on the mitochondrial energy metabolism. Specifically, low level of HACC stimulated the metabolic activity of mitochondria and the inhibition was found with high concentration of HACC. Then, the effect of HACC on mitochondrial respiratory chain was studied, which was consistent with the results of microcalorimetry. Finally, the alteration of mitochondrial structure induced by HACC was observed and it showed that the membrane of mitochondria was dramatically damaged. These new findings can help us deeply understand the influence and action mechanism of HACC in the metabolic process and provide theoretical and practical foundation for the biosafety of HACC as a medical carrier.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aammonium salts 3abiosafety 3acalorimetry 3acell adhesion 3achitosan 3aelectron transport chain 3amitochondria 3amitochondrial membrane 3aquaternary ammonium compounds 3awater solubility 0aChitosan quaternary ammonium salt (HACC) 0aMicrocalorimetry 0aMitochondria 0aMicroscopic1 aLi, Wei1 aFu, Boqiao1 aQin, Caiqin0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2019 Apr. 01, v. 126 p.828-833dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.12.2723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02521naa a2200265 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075024005100099040001800150100002000168245009600188300001400284500000900298520160200307592002801909650002101937650002301958650001601981700002001997773011902017852000902136856009802145655001202243991574753890742620221122161908.0191122e197401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7490320752DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci1974.0011183X001400010011x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMajor, Roger L.10aSeed Dormancy Characteristics of Sideoats Gramagrass, Bouteloua curtipendula (Michx.) Torr.  ap. 37-40.  aepub  aSeed sources of sideoats gramagrass [Bouteloua curtipendula (Michx.) Torr.] were accumulated from central and western United States, Mexico, and Argentina to evaluate duration and pattern of seed dormancy and to locate and identify dormancy conditioning factors of intact seed units (spikes of multiple spikelets). Dormant and nondormant seed sources were chosen for detailed investigations. Effects of time, removal of floral parts (glumes, lemmas, paleas, and awns), soil, leaching treatments, enriched oxygen atmosphere on germination, and potential inhibitors of seed units on germination of seed were studied. Postharvest dormancy was present in seed units of all sources, but disappeared after 4 to 6 months of dry storage after harvest. Postharvest dormancy was conditioned by nature of the caryopses. Long-term dormancy persisted in seed units for 5 years in dormant sources without viability change. Long-term dormancy was broken when floral parts were removed from caryopses. Placing seed units in soil, in enriched oxygen atmosphere, and in sodium hypochlorite was effective in breaking dormancy. The mechanism of longterm dormancy of sideoats gramagrass seed units involved interactions among the following factors: light weight of caryopses, impermeable floral parts of caryopses, and presence of coumarin-like inhibitory compounds. Association of dormancy with establishment under stress environments of grasslands is to be determined. Results of this investigation offer approaches to select and characterize germplasm with dormancy qualities that may be favorable to establishment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aplant physiology 3aplant biochemistry 3afield crops1 aWright, L.

The experiments were performed at salinities of 3.0 PSU (96.87 mmol/kg), 7.3 PSU (235.73 mmol/kg), 15 practical salinity unit (PSU) (484.39 mmol/kg) and 25 PSU (807.32 mmol/kg) in conditions of hypoxia (saturation == 15% O₂), anoxia (saturation <1% O₂) and control conditions in aerated water (saturation == 100% O₂), at a constant temperature of 10°°C. Hypoxia (saturation == 15% O₂) had no statistically significant effect (P > 0.05) on the osmoregulation of S. entomon in comparison with the control samples. Anoxia (saturation <1% O₂) decreased the osmotic concentration of hemolymph in S.entomon. After 6 h only at salinity 3 PSU there was a statistically significant difference between the anoxic and control samples (P < 0.05). After 96 h there was a statistically significant tendency (P < 0.05) for the osmotic concentrations to decrease in anoxic conditions at all the salinities tested except 25 PSU. A tendency was observed for the Na⁺⁺ concentrations in the hemolymph to decrease in anoxic conditions, which was statistically significant at salinity 7.3 PSU (P < 0.05) after 96 h but not statistically significant at the other salinities tested. The results show a low concentration of K⁺⁺ in the hemolymph of S. entomon and slight fluctuations of K⁺⁺ concentrations, but at environmental salinities the K⁺⁺ concentration decreases under anoxic conditions but not to a statistically significant extent (P > 0.05).  aPublisher supplied data 0aanoxia 0ahypoxia 0aK++ and Na++ regulation 0aosmoregulation 0aS. entomon 0aBaltic isopod1 aSzaniawska, Anna,0 tJournal of shellfish research.g2007 Apr., v. 26, no. 1 p.147-152dNational Shellfisheries Associationx0730-80007nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2983%2F0730-8000%282007%2926%5B147%3ATEOHAA%5D2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02157naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245007000165300001600235520135600251592002801607650001101635650001101646650001701657700002001674773010501694856004801799990002301847852000901870655001201879IND50070258720221117202519.0131030e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007025872DNAL7 a10.1007/s10961-013-9302-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBolli, Thomas10aCompetition and R&D cooperation with universities and competitors  ap. 768-787.  aThis paper analyses the relationship between competitive environment and R&D cooperation with universities and competitors. Our simple model suggests that cooperation creates benefits in terms of synergies but also induces costs due to spillovers. Since the value of these synergies and spillovers depends on the competitive pressure, cooperation propensity depends on the competitive environment. Differentiating between the dimensions of competition, we hypothesize that university cooperation corresponds to quality competition, while horizontal cooperation relates to price competition. Furthermore, we predict that a higher number of competitors reduces the incentives for horizontal cooperation as it diminishes the gains from “collusion”. We test these hypotheses using Swiss firm-level panel data that allows us to control for simultaneity of cooperation decisions and endogeneity of competition. Our empirical analysis supports the relevance of distinguishing between competition dimensions and cooperation partners, respectively. We find that price competition has an influence on university cooperation in the form of an inverted U. Quality competition only has an influence on university cooperation and the relationship shows a U-form. Moreover, we see that the number of principal competitors reduces cooperation between competitors.  aPublisher supplied data 3amodels 3aprices 3auniversities1 aWoerter, Martin0 tJournal of technology transfer.g2013 Dec., v. 38, no. 6 p.768-787dSpringer-Verlagx0892-99127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10961-013-9302-2  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01834naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245005900170300001800229520047200247592002800719596004300747596007800790596006400868596004800932650001800980650001500998650001701013650004401030650001001074650002201084653003201106653001301138653001701151700002201168700002701190773012501217856008501342852000901427655001201436IND60616214520221122030706.0181015e20181102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061621452DNAL7 a10.1080/14786419.2017.14232992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWisetsai, Awat12aA novel cyclohexenone from Trachyspermum roxburghianum  ap. 2499-2504.  aA novel cyclohexenone, roxydienone (1), together with 13 known compounds (2–14), were isolated from the seeds of Trachyspermum roxburghianum.

For the inert crystal Al₂O₃, we found that the surface oxygen vacancy amount of Al₂O₃ can be controlled by pretreatment of CO reduction, and the nearby coordinatively unsaturated Al-O (Alcᵤ-O) pairs can effectively catalyze propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The C₃H₆ formation rate of γ/δ-Al₂O₃ is in line with the concentration of oxygen vacancies. The experiments and DFT calculations illuminate the importance of oxygen vacancy on the surface of Al₂O₃ for PDH reaction. The consumption of lattice oxygen reduces the one coordination number of the bonding Al, the formed Alcᵤ-O as defective acid-base pairs, can be an effective way to tune the adsorption energy of the intermediates and the barriers of key steps (the first CH activation and H₂ formation) to enhance the performance of PDH through both site-dependent concerted and stepwise mechanisms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acarbon-hydrogen bond activation 3acatalytic activity 3adehydrogenation 3aenergy 3aoxygen 3apropane 0aPropane dehydrogenation 0aAlumina 0aCO reduction 0aOxygen vacancy 0aCoordinatively unsaturated Al-O pairs 0aReaction mechanism1 aLi, Zhi1 aTang, Peng1 aSong, Yangyang1 aZhao, Zhen1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0044-55121 aKong, Lian1 aFan, Xiaoqiang1 aXiao, Xia0 tJournal of catalysis.g2021 May, v. 397 p.172-182dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11700x0021-95177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcat.2021.03.0333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03144naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245011600171300001600287520183300303592002802136650001402164650002302178650001302201650001702214653001402231653000802245653000802253653000802261653000802269653000902277653000802286653000902294653000802303653000802311653002702319653002402346653002502370653001502395653001302410653001702423653001802440700002002458773009102478856008402569852000902653655001202662IND60676775120221119201424.0200503e20200501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067677512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ymeth.2019.11.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThone, Melissa N.10aExtracellular blebs: Artificially-induced extracellular vesicles for facile production and clinical translation  ap. 135-145.  aExtracellular vesicles (EVs) have emerged as promising biologic and comprehensive therapies for precision medicine. Despite their potential demonstrated at the benchtop, few EV formulations have made it to the clinic due to challenges in regulatory compliant scalable production; including purity, homogeneity, and reproducibility. For translation of this technology, there is a strong need for novel production methods that can meet clinical production criteria. Initial research aimed to address these challenges by taking advantage of natural pathways to increase EV yields. Such “conventional” approaches moderately increased yields but produced inhomogeneous EVs. Additionally, as there are currently no standard methods for isolation, characterization, or quantification, isolated EVs were often impure, contaminated with proteins and other biomacromolecules, and highly diverse in function. The use of shear stress and extrusion methods for EV-like vesicle production has also been investigated. While these processes can produce large EV-like vesicle yields nearly immediately, the harsh processes still result in inhomogeneous loading, and still suffer from poor purity. Chemically-induced membrane blebbing is a promising alternative production method that has the potential to overcome the previously insurmountable barriers of these current methods. This technique produces pure, and well defined EV-like vesicles, termed extracellular blebs (EBs), in clinically relevant scales over the course of minutes to hours. Furthermore, blebbing agents act on the cell in a way which locks the current surface properties and contents, preventing change, allowing for homogeneous EB production, and further preventing post-production changes. EBs may provide a promising pathway for clinical translation of EV technology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aextrusion 3aprecision medicine 3aproteins 3ashear stress 0aBCA assay 0aDLS 0aDTT 0aEBs 0aEVs 0aMVBs 0aNEM 0aNIbS 0aNTA 0aPFA 0aExtracellular vesicles 0aExtracellular blebs 0aClinical translation 0aProduction 0aExosomes 0aNanovesicles 0aMicrovesicles1 aKwon, Young Jik0 tMethods.g2020 May 01, v. 177 p.135-145dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12000x1046-20237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ymeth.2019.11.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02669naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245008200172300001400254520143700268592002801705650002701733650001701760650002501777650001901802650001101821650001701832650000701849650001801856650002201874650001601896653001701912653003201929653001701961653002101978700002201999700002102021700002202042773009002064856008402154852000902238655001202247IND60547572120221120151717.0160903s2015    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054757212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.proenv.2015.07.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKuwabara, Takeshi10aPurification and Characterization of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 Asparaginase  ap. 72-77.  aThe prevalence of bacterial infection has been gradually increased for the last decades. This phenomenon is predicted as one of serious problems to human security in the next decades. Helicobactorpylorihas been clarified to be related to gastric inflammation and a variety of diseases including gastric cancer. Recently, it has been known that H. pylori asparaginase is necessary for the growth in host infection and might be involved in inhibition of lymphocyte function at gastric niche. On the other hand, Pseudomonas aeruginosa is known to cause a fence-sitting infectious disease. However, no studies on a physiological role of asparaginase in relation to pathogenicity of P. aeruginosahave been found. Also, there are no studies on its physiological role in relation to pathogenicity of P. aeruginosa have been found. Therefore, we focused on purification and characterization of P. aeruginosaPAO1 asparaginase in order to clarify its physiological roles in this study. Intracellular asparaginase was highly purified and characterized from P. aeruginosa PAO1. The profile of DEAE-cellufine A 500 column chromatography suggested that two types of asparaginases were produced in P. aeruginosaPAO1. The optimum pH and temperature of the one enzyme was 9.5 and 40°C, respectively while those of the another was 9.5 and 65°C, respectively. Those results indicated that P. aeruginosa PAO1 had two different types of asparaginases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aasparaginase 3abacterial infections 3achromatography 3ahumans 3ainflammation 3apH 3apathogenicity 3astomach neoplasms 3atemperature 0aAsparaginase 0aPseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 0apurification 0acharacterization1 aPrihanto, Asep A.1 aWakayama, Mamoru1 aTakagi, Kazuyoshi0 tProcedia Environmental Sciences.g2015, v. 28 p.72-77dElsevier B.V.x1878-02967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.proenv.2015.07.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03071naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245012100172300001600293520138700309592002801696650004401724650002201768650003701790650002901827650001601856650002801872650001401900650001801914650001001932650001301942650000901955650001401964650001901978650001301997650001902010650001902029650002702048650003302075650002202108650003702130653002902167653001102196653001302207653001802220653001302238700005902251773013502310856008702445852000902532655001202541IND60629092820221120184201.0220214e20190401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062909282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.12.2582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrusty, Kalyani10aRelease of ciprofloxacin drugs by nano gold embedded cellulose grafted polyacrylamide hybrid nanocomposite hydrogels  ap. 765-775.  aThe present work involves the designing of the porous nano gold embedded cellulose grafted polyacrylamide (PAM/C/Au) nanocomposite hydrogel which has been prepared by in situ polymerization process with an objective of application for the in vitro release of ciprofloxacin drugs. The structure, composition, morphology behaviour of the nanocomposite hydrogels are explored using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction study (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS); field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The thermal stability of the as synthesized nanocomposite hydrogels are studied by TGA. The gelling actions of prepared nanocomposite hydrogels are determined by the rheological study. The investigations of cytotoxicity tests and antibacterial behaviour along with negative and positive actions of nanocomposite hydrogels are investigated. The study of the release rate of ciprofloxacin drugs is carried out by measuring water retention and swelling properties of nanocomposite hydrogels. The in vitro release rate of ciprofloxacin antibiotic drug is found to be 96.6% in 5 h. The PAM/C/Au nanocomposite hydrogels with improved thermal and rheological properties are suitable proposed as a good carrier towards in vitro release of the ciprofloxacin drugs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aantibacterial properties 3aantibiotics 3aatomic force microscopy 3acellulose 3aciprofloxacin 3adrugs 3agelation 3agold 3ahydrogels 3ananocomposites 3ananogold 3apolyacrylamide 3apolymerization 3arheological properties 3ascanning electron microscopy 3athermal stability 3atransmission electron microscopy 0aNanocomposites hydrogels 0aAu NPs 0aRheology 0aCiprofloxacin 0aIn vitro1 aSwain, Sarat K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1889-43750 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2019 Apr. 01, v. 126 p.765-775dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.12.2583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02795naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001600146245012700162300001800289520134400307650001601651650001901667650001101686650002101697650002001718650001501738650001001753650004101763650001301804650003301817650001301850650001501863650001501878650003301893650001801926650000901944650001201953650001601965650001801981700001901999700001602018700001702034700001502051700001802066773016102084856004702245852000902292655001202301IND60523504120221120152013.0160621e20160601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052350412DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.6b009092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTian, Jiang10aBiodegradation of the Organophosphate Trichlorfon and Its Major Degradation Products by a Novel Aspergillus sydowii PA F-2  ap. 4280-4287.  aTrichlorfon (TCF) is an important organophosphate pesticide in agriculture. However, limited information is known about the biodegradation behaviors and kinetics of this pesticide. In this study, a newly isolated fungus (PA F-2) from pesticide-polluted soils was identified as Aspergillus sydowii on the basis of the sequencing of internal transcribed spacer rDNA. This fungus degraded TCF as sole carbon, sole phosphorus, and sole carbon–phosphorus sources in a mineral salt medium (MSM). Optimal TCF degradation conditions were determined through response surface methodology, and results also revealed that 75.31% of 100 mg/L TCF was metabolized within 7 days. The degradation of TCF was accelerated, and the mycelial dry weight of PA F-2 was remarkably increased in MSM supplemented with exogenous sucrose and yeast extract. Five TCF metabolic products were identified through gas chromatography–mass spectrometry. TCF could be initially hydrolyzed to dichlorvos and then be degraded through the cleavage of the P–C bond to produce dimethyl hydrogen phosphate and chloral hydrate. These two compounds were subsequently deoxidized to produce dimethyl phosphite and trichloroethanal. These results demonstrate the biodegradation pathways of TCF and promote the potential use of PA F-2 to bioremediate TCF-contaminated environments. 3aAspergillus 3abiodegradation 3acarbon 3achemical bonding 3achloral hydrate 3adichlorvos 3afungi 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3ahydrogen 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3amycelium 3aphosphates 3aphosphorus 3aresponse surface methodology 3aribosomal DNA 3asoil 3asucrose 3atrichlorfon 3ayeast extract1 aDong, Qiaofeng1 aYu, Chenlei1 aZhao, Ruixue1 aWang, Jing1 aChen, Lanzhou0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2016 June 1, v. 64, no. 21 p.4280-4287dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Divisionx0021-85617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.6b00909  aDNAL 7aarticle02606naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100001600161245007600177300001300253506002800266520136900294592002801663506003701691650001301728650002501741650002001766650001901786650002001805650001801825650001201843650001001855650001201865650001301877653002901890653002301919700002101942773014001963856009602103852000902199655001202208IND60785625220221207115716.0200914e198812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078562522DNAL7 ahttps://doi.org/10.37833/cord.v4i01.2072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDavis, T.A.10aCoconut bisexual flowers and their significance for hybrid seed gardens  ap. 7-14.  aResource is Open Access  aAmong the tall and dwarf varieties of coconut as well as the hybrids between them, occasionally one comes across hermaphro­dite or bisexual flowers. Some indNridual palms produce a high percentage of hermaphrodite flowers while a great majority of others do not produce any bisexual flower at all. There is clear evidence that coconut flowers at the primordial stage are bisexual with the potential. to develop both stamens and pistils in the same flower. But at a later stage of development, one grows into a female flower whose male organs are reduced to a ring of six staminodes. Another develops into a staminate flower whose pistils are reduced to three pistillodes. However, due to genetic, ecological, physiological or other factors, some unisexual. flowers show an atavistic display of hermaphroditisin. Bisexual flowers are observed among tall. and dwarf variety palms. The negligible percent­age of bisexual flowers that occur in large estates where the fruits are not used as seeds has no major disadvantage. But in seed gardens, especially where inter‑varietal hybrid seeds are produced, hermaphrodite flowers are capable of reducing the percentage of true hybrids. Timely removal of hermaphrodite flowers, therefore, would reduce the occurrence of undesirable true‑to‑mother type progeny and enhance the success of intervarietal hybridization.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acoconuts 3adevelopmental stages 3adwarf cultivars 3afemale flowers 3ahermaphroditism 3ahybridization 3ahybrids 3amales 3aprogeny 3aresearch 0acoconut bisexual flowers 0ahybrid seed garden1 aMaliangkay, R.B.0 tCORD.

We find that the primary decomposition reactions of tripalmitin initiate with the successive scission of the alkyl-oxygen bond to form three straight chain C₁₆H₃₁O₂˙ (RCOO˙) radicals and C₃H₅˙ radical. The deoxygenated alkyl chain is produced through the decarboxylation of the RCOO˙ radical with concurrent production of CO₂. The resulting alkyl and C₃H₅˙ radicals further undergo recombination and decomposition to yield mainly alkanes and alkenes, with the actual product distribution being dependent on reaction temperature. β-Scission plays an important role in alkyl chain decomposition with a concomitant release of C₂H₄. Compared to 1500 K, this reaction is accelerated at 2000 K. In addition, the formation of cyclic hydrocarbon is also observed at 2000 K. As opposed to previous proposed Diels–Alder reactions or intramolecular cyclizations of alkenyl radicals mechanisms, it is found that cyclopentane could be produced by intramolecular cyclization of a biradical.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkanes 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon dioxide production 3acatalytic activity 3acleavage (chemistry) 3acycloaddition reactions 3adecarboxylation 3aethylene 3afree radicals 3amolecular dynamics 3apyrolysis 3asimulation models 3atemperature 3atriacylglycerols 3atripalmitin1 aYan, Kefeng1 aZhang, Jilong0 tRSC advances.g2013 Apr. 16, v. 3, no. 18 p.6401-6407dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3ra22902e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02740naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005700151245008300208300001600291520106000307592002801367650002001395650001401415650001301429650001301442650001501455650001301470650002201483653001901505653001001524653002001534653001701554653001501571700006301586700002101649700006101670700005801731700005901789700002401848700006201872700001601934700002101950700006101971773013202032856008502164852000902249655001202258IND60722335420221122031731.0210101e20200908xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072233542DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jproteome.0c003822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaito, Mak A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6040-929510aDevelopment of an Ocean Protein Portal for Interactive Discovery and Education  ap. 326-336.  aProteins are critical in catalyzing chemical reactions, forming key cellular structures, and in regulating cellular processes. Investigation of marine microbial proteins by metaproteomics methods enables the discovery of numerous aspects of microbial biogeochemical processes. However, these datasets present big data challenges as they often involve many samples collected across broad geospatial and temporal scales, resulting in thousands of protein identifications, abundances, and corresponding annotation information. The Ocean Protein Portal (OPP) was created to enable data sharing and discovery among multiple scientific domains and serve both research and education functions. The portal focuses on three use case questions: “Where is my protein of interest?”, “Who makes it?”, and “How much is there?” and provides profile and section visualizations, real-time taxonomic analysis, and links to metadata, sequence analysis, and other external resources to enable connections to be made between biogeochemical and proteomics datasets.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3aeducation 3ametadata 3aproteome 3aproteomics 3aresearch 3asequence analysis 0ametaproteomics 0aocean 0abiogeochemistry 0adata sharing 0aweb portal1 aSaunders, Jaclyn K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1023-62391 aChagnon, Michael1 aGaylord, David A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7987-68701 aShepherd, Adam1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4486-94481 aHeld, Noelle A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1073-08511 aDupont, Christopher1 aSymmonds, Nicholas1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9436-03511 aYork, Amber1 aCharron, Matthew1 aKinkade, Danie B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1134-73470 tJournal of proteome research.g2020 Sept. 08, v. 20, no. 1 p.326-336dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23605x1535-39077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jproteome.0c003823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02833naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245012200170520134500292592002801637650001101665650002601676650001401702650001101716650001901727650001701746650000901763650001201772650002201784650002701806650001401833650002001847650002901867650001501896650001001911650001701921651001001938653002201948653002101970653002101991653002502012653002102037700002002058700002002078700002102098773011302119856008602232852000902318655001202327IND60702684620221119104541.0201209e20201201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070268462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1229982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDabaieh, Marwa12aA comparative study of life cycle carbon emissions and embodied energy between sun-dried bricks and fired clay bricks  aThis study presents a comparison of the life cycle carbon emission (LCCO₂) and embodied energy calculation between two kinds of bricks, sun-dried and fired clay, as means of evaluating the energy and climate impact of each brick type and the economics of production. Focus is paid to the differences across the whole production chain between sun-dried clay bricks, which represent the traditional norm, and fired clay bricks, which are the most widely-used walling materials in conventional buildings. A case study was carried out in Dakhla Oasis in the Western Desert of Egypt. The results of this study show that if sun-dried bricks are used instead of fired bricks, a reduction of up to 5907 kg CO₂e (in CO₂ emissions) and 5305 MJ of embodied energy for every1000 bricks produced could be achieved. The paper concludes by offering alternative scenarios for brick-making and suggestions for improving sun-dried brick production. The methodology used in this study contributes to the development of an investigative-comparative way to assess choices between building materials. It also intends to help inform local homeowners and building practitioners not only in Egypt, but also globally, about resource depletion, energy consumption, and harmful emissions from fired industrial bricks as a common building construction material.  aPublisher supplied data 3abricks 3abuilding construction 3abuildings 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acase studies 3aclay 3aclimate 3acomparative study 3aconstruction materials 3aeconomics 3aembodied energy 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3ahomeowners 3aoases 3asolar drying 3aEgypt 0aCarbon life cycle 0aCarbon emissions 0aCradle to cradle 0aSun-dried clay brick 0aFired clay brick1 aHeinonen, Jukka1 aEl-Mahdy, Deena1 aHassan, Dalya M.0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2020 Dec. 01, v. 275 p.122998-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1229983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03395naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245013600170520194400306592002802250650001502278650001702293650002002310650001102330650001502341650001302356650001402369650002102383650002302404650002402427650001302451650001502464651001002479653001302489653002802502653004002530653001802570653002202588700001502610700001802625700001502643700001502658700001802673700001402691773010102705856008602806852000902892655001202901IND60758206820221122150706.0220103e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075820682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.1084172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Chunyan10aImpacts of vegetation properties and temperature characteristics on species richness patterns in drylands: Case study from Xinjiang  aEnergy availability at trophic and hydrologic level dominates species richness gradients by constraining food resources, and regulating population sizes and extinction rates. Remote sensing datasets have mapped vegetation productivities as a proxy for energy availability, for example, using Dynamic Habitat Indices (DHIs). Considering the sparse vegetation across drylands, we developed indices of Land surface temperature (ILST) based on daytime land surface temperature from Terra and Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), which has three components: (1) annual mean temperature (LSTmean), (2) annual maximum temperature (LSTmax), and (3) standard deviation of temperature (LSTstd). We hypothesized that the temperature variables, such as ILST, would predict species richness better than productivity proxies across drylands. Thus, our objective was to determine how well they would predict the richness of plants, mammals and birds across the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. We calculated the DHIs and ILST from the MODIS vegetation and temperature products from 2001 to 2015. We found that: (1) ILST could capture more additive information compared with DHIs in terms of the relatively high variance explanation of species richness and high variable importance, and the combination of ILST and DHIs gave better predictions than single metrics for species richness patterns. (2) Plants and birds were more sensitive to temperature than vegetation productivity, probably due to physiological tolerance and evolutionary processes. (3) LSTstd was the most important variable affecting species richness, except on mammals. High LSTstd was related to more food resources and habitats, and low LSTstd represented extreme environment and environmental stress. Combined vegetation properties and temperature variabilities are good determinants of species richness, and should be carefully considered in future research.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarid lands 3acase studies 3adata collection 3aenergy 3aextinction 3ahabitats 3ahydrology 3aspecies richness 3astandard deviation 3asurface temperature 3avariance 3avegetation 3aChina 0aDrylands 0aDynamic habitat indices 0aIndices of land surface temperature 0aRandom forest 0aEnergy hypothesis1 aLi, Liping1 aGuan, Yanning1 aCai, Danlu1 aChen, Hong1 aBian, Xiaolin1 aGuo, Shan0 tEcological indicators.g2021 Dec., v. 133 p.108417-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.1084173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01726naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001600137245006400153300001400217520075200231592002800983650001101011650001701022650001401039650001601053650001001069650001901079650002401098650002601122650001501148651001601163651002301179773009401202856007101296852000901367655001201376IND60518469420221119004958.0160417e196701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051846942DNAL7 a10.2307/19334202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNeushul, M.10aStudies of Subtidal Marine Vegetation in Western Washington  ap. 83-94.  aObjectively defined, benthic plant associations in the Puget Sound region are compared with associations recorded by other workers, in this and other areas.

The purpose of this paper is to analyze some of the links between the two notions of sustainable diet and sustainable food system in order to facilitate their implementation. The notion of sustainable diet was defined in 2010, combining two very different perspectives: nutrition, focused on individuals, and global sustainability, in all its dimensions, environmental, economic and social. The nutrition perspective can be easily linked to the objective of health improvement. The sustainability perspective requires more complex analyses. We propose to consider it as the contribution of a diet to the sustainability of a food system. Such an approach, covering the three dimensions of sustainable development, enables to identify interactions and interrelations between food systems and diets. It gives the possibility to find levers of change towards sustainability. Diets are at the same time the result of the way food systems function and drivers of systemic changes. Drivers of change for each category of actors inside food systems, consumers, private sector… are different and can be triggered by different concerns (health, environment, social and cultural aspects). Integrating these different dimensions and motivations can encourage transition towards sustainable diets, depending on the specificities of each food system. Adoption of sustainable diets can be facilitated and activated by the very structure of food systems, as well as by appropriate policies and incentives.  aPublisher supplied data 3adiet 3ahunger 3aissues and policy 3amalnutrition 3amotivation 3aprivate sector 3asustainable development 0aAlimentation durable 0aSystèmes alimentaires durables 0aDéveloppement durable 0aSécurité alimentaire et nutrition 0aRégime méditerranéen 0aSustainable diet 0aSustainable food systems 0aSustainable development 0aFood security and nutrition1 aGitz, Vincent0 tCahiers de Nutrition et de Dietetique.g2016 Dec., v. 51 p.304-314dElsevier Masson SASwJournal:jnl17549x0007-99607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cnd.2016.09.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02558naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245013700168300001800305520139000323592002801713650001401741650002201755650001501777650001801792650001601810653002201826653002701848653002001875653003101895653003201926700002201958700003001980773009202010856008502102852000902187655001202196IND60611986420221122041611.0201202e20181101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061198642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2018.08.1082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLešnik, Maja10aDesign parameters of the timber-glass upgrade module and the existing building: Impact on the energy-efficient refurbishment process  ap. 1125-1138.  aRefurbishment of old existing buildings means an enormous potential for improving their energy efficiency. Besides the established renovation methods encompassing mostly measures applied to the thermal envelope, the extension of existing buildings with lightweight structural upgrades has become popular especially in densely populated urban areas. While being beneficial to the reduction of the transmission losses through the roof of the existing building, the above solution also results in acquisition of new floor surface. Despite the increasing number of such renovations in practice, this topic is rather poorly supported by scientific research, which results in a lack of general design guidelines.The paper discusses the impact the timber-glass upgrade module has on energy-efficient refurbishment of multi-family buildings. The main variable design parameters of the numerical study are the height of the upgrade module and the existing building, relevant to the number of storeys, alongside with the thermal transmittance of the module envelope elements, its glazing size and orientation. The key of the study is to explore to which extent the application of the timber-glass upgrade module influences the energy need of the hybrid building regarding the aforementioned design parameters with the aim of establishing design guidelines for refurbishment with attic extension.  aPublisher supplied data 3abuildings 3aenergy efficiency 3aguidelines 3atransmittance 3aurban areas 0aenergy efficiency 0aBuilding refurbishment 0aAttic extension 0aBuilding design parameters 0aTimber-glass upgrade module1 aPremrov, Miroslav1 aLeskovar, Vesna Žegarac,0 tEnergy.g2018 Nov. 01, v. 162 p.1125-1138dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2018.08.1083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03335naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002800150245008800178300001400266520216400280592002802444650001102472650001202483650001502495650001102510650002502521650002102546650001202567651001302579653001902592653002602611653001602637653001702653653001402670700002202684700002002706700001602726773009002742856008402832852000902916655001202925IND60547572420221117170930.0160903s2015    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054757242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.proenv.2015.07.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJani, Haza Hanurhaza Md12aA Review on the Medina Charter in Response to the Heterogeneous Society in Malaysia  ap. 92-99.  aMalaysia is a Muslim country which comprises of a heterogeneous society. Through the efforts of the current and previous government, Malaysia has beenattempting to include the Islamic principles into its governance. Firstly, it starts with the concept of the Asian values, moving on to Islam Hadhari, and the recent one is the idea of One Malaysia. These gestures speculate that Malaysia is in the process of bringing and applying back the Islamic way of governance system with reference to the first Islamic law, the Medina charter. Based on the Islamic history, the Medina charter was the first constitution drafted and documented in Islam providing the basis of the city-state between Muslim and non-Muslim in the medieval Muslim city of Medina. The content of the charter manages to unite a multi-religious and multi-ethnicity (heterogeneous) in the city. Therefore, this study is conducted to enlighten people's understanding on the success of the Medina charter, in relation to the heterogeneous society in Malaysia. The charter is applicable to be adapted into the Malaysian government in which the citizens are heterogeneous society. Hence, the aim of this study is to learn the reasons behind the success of the Medina charter in response to the heterogeneous society in Malaysia. In order to achieve the aim of this study, several objectives are highlighted to identify the purpose and function of the charter as well as to analyze the success of the charter to heterogeneous society in Malaysia. This study is based on the qualitative research methodology; thus, the document analysis is adopted to define and understand the Medina charter. The findings of this study emphasize three main aspects, namely, i) the condition of the Medina city before and after the establishment of the charter, and ii) the relationship of the charter with heterogeneous society, and iii) the importance of the charter to the Islamic city-state, especially in Malaysia. The outcomes of this study will assist to strengthen the understanding towards the importance of Medina charter and the significance of upholding the Islamic principles and values in heterogeneous.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMedina 3aMuslims 3agovernance 3apeople 3aqualitative analysis 3aresearch methods 3asociety 3aMalaysia 0aMedina charter 0aHeterogeneous society 0aIslamic law 0aHuman rights 0aMalaysia.1 aHarun, Nor Zalina1 aMansor, Mazlina1 aZen, Ismawi0 tProcedia Environmental Sciences.g2015, v. 28 p.92-99dElsevier B.V.x1878-02967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.proenv.2015.07.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01916naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245011600155300001600271520076200287592002801049650002901077650002501106650001401131650001301145650001401158650001101172650002601183650001501209651001001224653003601234653001501270700001501285700001901300773014101319856007301460852000901533655001201542IND60743107620221120123919.0210707e20210705xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074310762DNAL7 a10.18474/JES20-632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTu, Huizhen10aResponse of Acetylcholinesterase to Insecticides in Reticulitermes chinensis Snyder (Isoptera: Rhinotermitidae)  ap. 343-348.  aThe subterranean termite Reticulitermes chinensis Snyder is an important pest in China. We determined the inhibition of six selected insecticides to acetylcholinesterase (AChE) extracted from R. chinensis. Our results yielded half maximal inhibitory concentrations (I₅₀) for each of the insecticides to be 3.49 × 10–³ M for methomyl, 3.87 × 10–² M for phoxim, 2.18 × 10–³ M for triazophos, 1.89 × 10–³ M for profenosos, 1.10 × 10–³ M for malathion, and 4.39 × 10–² M for omethoate. Furthermore, the inhibitory activity of AChE by the six insecticides was increased with the increase of insecticide concentration from 3.3 × 10–⁷ to 5 × 10–³ M. These results provide a theoretical basis for the management of R. chinensis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aReticulitermes chinensis 3aacetylcholinesterase 3amalathion 3amethomyl 3aomethoate 3aphoxim 3asubterranean termites 3atriazophos 3aChina 0aReticulitermes chinensis Snyder 0aI50 values1 aTang, Fang1 aYang, Haijiang0 tJournal of entomological science.g2021 July 5, v. 56, no. 3 p.343-348dGeorgia Entomological SocietywJournal:jnl43038x0749-80047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.18474/JES20-633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02624naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001700112245015000129300001400279506002800293520147300321592002801794506003701822650001401859650001601873650002601889650000901915650000901924650001301933650002401946650001701970653002201987653001402009653002102023700002102044700001802065700002002083773012602103852000902229655001202238IND60785625520221207115717.0211228e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078562552DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlizadeh, F.10aEffect of Supplementary Irrigation at Different Growth Stages on the Yield and Water Productivity of Autumn Rapeseed Cultivar Rohan (Khorramabad)  ap. 15-26.  aResource is Open Access  aIn areas with high rainfall distribution, proper irrigation management, including complementary irrigation, is one of the effective strategies to increase crop production. In order to investigate the effect of supplementary irrigation in different growth stages on the yield and water productivity of Autumn rapeseed, an experiment in the form of a complete randomized block design with five irrigation management treatments including rainfed (I1), single irrigation at flowering stage (I2), single Irrigation at pod filling stage (I3), two irrigation at pod filling stage and flowering (I4), three irrigation at flowering, and pod filling and grain Filling stages (I5) was carried out at Lorestan University Research Field. Results showed that there was a significant difference between the effects of different irrigation treatments at 1% level. The lowest grain yield, biological yield and oil yield were obtained in I1 treatment with 44.62%, 50.95% and 53.58% decrease, as compared to I5 treatment. The results also showed that by applying irrigation at pod filling stage, grain yield and oil yield were increased by 13.22% and 20.23%, as compared to I1 treatment. The highest total productivity for the grain yield and oil yield was obtained in I5 treatment with 0.252 and 0.073 kg / m3. In general, due to the fact that drought stress in rapeseed calving stages reduces yield, the higher the number of irrigations in rapeseed calving stages, the more the yield.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acultivars 3agrain yield 3airrigation management 3aoils 3arain 3arapeseed 3auniversity research 3awater stress 0asingle irrigation 0aoil yield 0abiological yield1 aNasrolahi, A.

Investigation of the sequence of the 16S rRNA genes in a clinical isolate of V. furnissii by visual inspection of a sequencing electropherogram revealed two sites of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; positions 460 A/G and 1261 A/G) in these genes. A test of 12 strains each of V. fluvialis and V. furnissii revealed these SNPs to be common in V. furnissii but not in V. fluvialis. Divergence of SNP frequency was observed among the strains of V. furnissii tested. Because the SNPs described in V. furnissii produce a difference in the target sequence of restriction enzymes, a combination of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of the 16S rRNA genes using conventional primers and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis using Eco RV and Eae I was shown to discriminate between V. fluvialis and V. furnissii. This method is simple and alleviates the need for expensive equipment or primer sets specific to these bacteria. Therefore, we believe that this method can be useful, alongside specific PCR and mass spectrometry, when there is a need to discriminate between V. fluvialis and V. furnissii.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA primers 3aVibrio furnissii 3abacteria 3aequipment 3agenes 3amass spectrometry 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arestriction endonucleases 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3aribosomal RNA 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 0a16S rRNA gene 0aSingle-nucleotide polymorphism 0aVibrio fluvialis 0aVibrio furnissii1 aYamada, Akiteru1 aUmeki, Kazumi1 aSaeki, Yuji1 aHashikura, Yuuki1 aYamamoto, Ikuo1 aUmekita, Kunihiko1 aUrayama-Kawano, Midori1 aYamasaki, Shogo1 aTaniguchi, Takako1 aMisawa, Naoaki1 aOkayama, Akihiko0 tJournal of microbiological methods.g2018 Jan., v. 144 p.22-28dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6372x0167-70127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mimet.2017.10.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01697naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245007100165300001400236520079700250592002801047650001301075650001201088650001001100650001401110650001001124650001201134650001001146700001601156700001701172700002101189773009201210856004801302852000901350655001201359IND4485390620221118020333.0120727e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448539062DNAL7 a10.1007/s10164-011-0296-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKasatani, Asami10aCourtship tactics by male Ilyoplax pusilla (Brachyura, Dotillidae)  ap. 69-74.  aMating in the dotillid crab Ilyoplax pusilla occurs after the female enters the maleâs burrow in the tidal flat. Males use two tactics to cause females to enter their burrows for mating: the male either directs claw waving to the female (courting-wave display), to which the females responds by following the male to his burrow, or the male runs rapidly away from, then back toward, his burrow (dash-out-back display), which startles the female into his burrow. Males more often used the courting-wave than the dash-out-back display, but mating success did not differ between the two tactics. Male use of either tactic was influenced by date, female density and male size; the courting-wave display was used by larger males, later in the breeding period, and under higher female density.  aPublisher supplied data 3abreeding 3aburrows 3aclaws 3acourtship 3acrabs 3afemales 3amales1 aWada, Keiji1 aYusa, Yoichi1 aChristy, John H.0 tJournal of ethology.g2012 Jan., v. 30, no. 1 p.69-74dSpringer-Verlagx0289-07717nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10164-011-0296-7  aDNAL 7aarticle03381naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245012900169520194600298592002802244650001902272650001802291650001102309650001102320650002902331650002502360650002902385650002902414650001402443650002602457650001402483650001102497650002102508650001102529650001502540651001002555653003202565653002202597653002302619653003102642653001502673700001502688773011302703856008602816852000902902655001202911IND60702684820221119104537.0201024e20201120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070268482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1230012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAkbar, Arslan10aAssessing recycling potential of carbon fiber reinforced plastic waste in production of eco-efficient cement-based materials  aThe improper management and disposal of carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) waste to landfill or incineration can cause serious environmental implications. In recent years, efforts have been made to utilize recycled carbon fibers (rCFs) into the cement composites. However, no information is available on the environmental impacts of utilizing rCFs into the cement composites. In this study, efforts were made to assess the resourceful recycling of this waste to cement-based materials and to investigate the effects of recycled carbon fibers (rCFs) as reinforcement on the mechanical performance and environmental impacts of cement composites. Moreover, in-use stocks of carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) in commercial aeronautical and wind power sectors of China were calculated to estimate the prospective CFRP waste available in China for recycling. The experimental results resolved that the addition of rCFs to cement composites can provide significant improvement in mechanical performance. Among other notable results, cement composite reinforced with 1% by volume of rCFs showed optimum performance with an increase in elastic modulus, splitting tensile strength, and fracture toughness of up to 57%, 188%, and 325%, respectively. Environmental impact assessment revealed that the addition of 1% of rCFs while replacing 10% of cement with silica fume, the overall global warming potential (GWP) in terms of CO₂ emissions, comes out to be 13.69% less than plain cement paste GWP impact. On the other hand, 222% of energy consumption and 70% of the cost can be saved by replacing the virgin carbon fibers (vCFs) with rCFs into the cement composites. Estimation of in-use stocks of CFRP highlighted that about 97000 Tons of CFRP waste would be cumulated into the landfills of China by the year 2044 that can be recycled to recover carbon fibers to effectively utilize them in the production of eco-friendly cement composites.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon fibers 3acement 3aenergy 3aenvironmental assessment 3aenvironmental impact 3aglobal warming potential 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3alandfills 3amodulus of elasticity 3arecycling 3asilica 3atensile strength 3awastes 3awind power 3aChina 0aRecycled carbon fiber (rCF) 0aCement composites 0aFracture toughness 0aSplitting tensile strength 0aCFRP waste1 aLiew, K.M.0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2020 Nov. 20, v. 274 p.123001-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1230013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02159naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245008400169300001600253520093700269592002801206650001001234650002501244650001701269650001801286650001201304650001501316650002001331650001601351650001601367653003401383653001501417653003001432653002701462700002101489700002001510773013501530856008701665852000901752655001201761IND60629093120221120163922.0220214e20190401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062909312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.12.2662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiong, Xiong14aThe antioxidant activities of phosphorylated polysaccharide from native ginseng  ap. 842-845.  aThe extraction method and antioxidant activities of polysaccharides from native ginseng were studied.

The yield of polysaccharide was 27%. The polysaccharide was chemically modified with phosphorus oxychloride-pyridine to obtain phosphorylated derivative. Antioxidant test showed that polysaccharide from native ginseng had significant scavenging effect on free radicals. It indicated that the phosphorylated derivative had higher scavenging ability to every kind of radicals than the underivatized polysaccharide.

They are also a good supply of carbohydrates and micronutrients, as well as high quality dietary fibers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUnited Nations 3acarbohydrates 3adietary fiber 3aessential amino acids 3agrains 3ahealthy diet 3aFrance 0aLégumineuses 0aLégumes secs 0aComposition 0aConsommation 0aIntérêt nutritionnel 0aPulse 0aComposition 0aConsumption 0aNutritional interest0 tCahiers de Nutrition et de Dietetique.g2017 Apr., v. 52 p.71-77dElsevier Masson SASaSociété française de nutritionwJournal:jnl17549x0007-99607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cnd.2016.11.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03652naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245011900169520171700288592002802005650002002033650002102053650002702074650001502101650001202116650000902128650001202137650001302149650002202162650002002184650001302204650002002217650002002237650001102257650001802268650001102286650002102297650001702318650001902335650001902354650001002373650001802383651001002401653003002411653002802441653001702469653002602486653001202512653002502524700001602549700001902565700001602584700001802600700001602618700002602634700001602660700001702676700001902693700005802712773011302770856008602883852000902969655001202978IND60702684920221119104530.0201209e20201201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070268492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1230022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Zhi-Quan10aCoupling phytoremediation of cadmium-contaminated soil with safe crop production based on a sorghum farming system  aWith increasing environmental pressure and soil pollution, sustainable energy and food production for a steadily growing world population is a grand challenge. Globally, nearly 12 million hectares of croplands are contaminated by cadmium (Cd), and how to develop a production system for the cleaning and utilisation of such contaminated land is essential for sustainability. Herein, a diverse panel of 166 sorghum accessions was grown in typical Cd-contaminated fields in two consecutive years, and the effect of different accessions and organs on the phytoremediation potential was evaluated by analysing the Cd concentrations of stems, leaves and grains at maturity. Both the bioaccumulation factors (BCFs) and the aboveground Cd accumulation varied substantially and the differences were up to 13–24 fold. The aboveground Cd accumulation was positively associated with important bioenergy traits including biomass, stem Brix, internode numbers and plant height, as envisaged by the high Cd concentration in sweet sorghum accessions, while BCF was significantly negatively correlated with relevant agronomic traits except Brix. The genetic regulation of Cd concentration in grains is different from those in leaves and stems, which allowed us to screen for three types of sorghum resources with the potential to couple soil phytoremediation with the production of bioethanol, safe grains and forage. A sorghum farming system was further proposed, which could reduce soil Cd concentration below the safe level within 12 years and obtain economic returns of about 70.5–169.5 million Chinese Yuan (CNY) by producing bioethanol, safe grains and forage in one season in 30% of the Cd-contaminated soil in China.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSorghum bicolor 3aagronomic traits 3abioaccumulation factor 3abioethanol 3abiomass 3abrix 3acadmium 3acleaning 3acosts and returns 3acrop production 3acropland 3afarming systems 3afood production 3aforage 3agrain sorghum 3aleaves 3aphytoremediation 3aplant height 3apolluted soils 3asoil pollution 3astems 3asweet sorghum 3aChina 0aSorghum (Sorghum bicolor) 0aSustainable agriculture 0aCadmium (Cd) 0aSoil phytoremediation 0aBiofuel 0aSafe crop production1 aLi, Hong-Li1 aZeng, Xian-Jie1 aLü, Cheng,1 aFu, Jing-Ying1 aGuo, Li-Jun1 aKimani, Wilson Mwangi1 aYan, Hui-Li1 aHe, Zhen-Yan1 aHao, Huai-Qing1 aJing, Hai-Chun1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9329-069X0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2020 Dec. 01, v. 275 p.123002-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1230023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02645naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245015800156300001800314500002000332520149600352592002801848650001301876650001301889650002601902650001201928650001301940650001301953700001701966700002001983700001902003700001802022700001702040700001802057773011302075856007402188852000902262655001202271IND60579483420221122030912.0170818e20171001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057948342DNAL7 a10.1002/pola.287002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMi, Zhiming10aSoluble polyimides containing 1,4:3,6‐dianhydro‐d‐glucidol and fluorinated units: Preparation, characterization, optical, and dielectric properties  ap. 3253-3265.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAiming to develop soluble and colorless polyimides, two novel diamines, 2,5‐bis(2‐trifluoromethyl‐4‐amino‐phenoxy)‐1,4:3,6‐dianhydrosorbitol (2a) and 2,5‐bis(2‐methyl‐4‐amino‐phenoxy)‐1,4:3,6‐dianhydrosorbitol (2b), were designed and synthesized by the reduction of corresponding dinitro monomer which was obtained via solvent‐free melt heating method. Polyimides (PI–(1–5)) containing 1,4:3,6‐dianhydro‐d‐glucidol fragments were prepared from 2a and five kinds of common dianhydrides and PI–6 was synthesized from 2b and 4,4′‐(hexafluoroisopropylidene)‐diphthalic anhydride (6FDA) via a two‐step thermal imidization. All the polyimides were readily soluble in common polar solvents and could afford flexible, tough, and transparent films with transparency as high as 87% at 450 nm. Meanwhile, PI–(1–6) exhibited unexpectedly low dielectric constants of 2.02–2.52 at 1 MHz. In addition, analogs PI–7 derived from 2,5‐bis(4‐amino‐phenoxy)‐1,4:3,6‐dianhydrosorbitol (2c) and 6FDA and PI–8 derived from 4,4′‐bis(4‐amino‐2‐trifluoromethylphenoxy)biphenyl (2d) and 6FDA were also obtained via a two‐step thermal imidization for comparision with PI–(1–6) on aspects of thermal, mechnical, optical, electrical, and morphological properties. The structure–property relationships of PI–(1–8) were discussed in detail. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Polym. Sci., Part A: Polym.

The use of microbe-derived fuel alcohols is a viable alternative, as they are renewable, emit fewer greenhouse gasses, and require little augmentation of current energy infrastructure as compared to other sustainable transportation options such as electric vehicles and fuel cells. Here, we present a brief overview of candidate substrates for alcohol production with a focus on lignocellulosic sources, relevant microorganisms under research for industrialization and the biotechnological techniques used to improve alcohol production phenotypes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalcohols 3abiofuels 3aenergy 3aenvironmental impact 3afossil fuels 3afuel cells 3agreenhouses 3aindustrialization 3ainfrastructure 3amicroorganisms 3aphenotype 3atransportation1 aDufour, Nicholas1 aSwana, Jeffrey0 tIn vitro cellular & developmental biology.g2011 Dec., v. 47, no. 6 p.637-649dSpringer-Verlagx1054-54767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11627-011-9374-3  aDNAL 7aarticle01680naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003000147245007200177300001800249520041200267592002800679650002400707650002100731650002300752650002300775650002200798650002200820653002000842653001700862653003600879700002900915700002900944700003700973700002601010700003001036700004601066773008001112856008101192852000901273655001201282IND60551342920221120134015.0161018e20140520xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055134292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2013.12.0362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Oliveira Lopes, Raquel10aContinuous flow whole cell bioreduction of fluorinated acetophenone  ap. 3239-3242.  aSeveral microorganism strains were used to reduce 2,2,2-trifluoroacetophenone (1) and 4′-Br-2,2,2-trifluoroacetophenone (3).

This study examined the seasonal variation of A. nodosum in phenolic contents and subsequent antioxidant, α-glucosidase and α-amylase inhibitory activities. A. nodosum was harvested monthly and extracted in hot water and the resulting extracts were spray-dried. The results indicate a clear seasonal variation in terms of phenolic content, with June and July being the highest (36.4 and 37 mg/g, respectively) and May the lowest (21.8 mg/g). The antioxidant activities, in terms of 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical scavenging activity, correlated with the phenolic contents observed (r = 0.81), with the month of July being the highest (58%) and April the lowest (26%). Similarly in terms of Trolox equivalent, July had the highest activity (15.53 μM) and April and May the lowest (8.40 and 8.27 μM, respectively). α-glucosidase inhibitory activity exhibited a pattern similar to the phenolic contents observed with July having the highest inhibitory activity (IC70 2.23 μg) and April the lowest (IC70 26.13 μg), resulting in an inverse correlation between IC70 values and total phenolic content (r = −0.89). Such seasonal variation is believed to be caused by temperature-related stress considering that A. nodosum is a cold water species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAscophyllum nodosum 3aantioxidant activity 3acold 3afree radical scavengers 3aharvesting 3amacroalgae 3aseasonal variation 2aAntioxidantsxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aAscophyllumxchemistry 2aDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2xprevention & control 2aEnzyme Inhibitorsxchemistryxisolation & purificationxpharmacology. 2aFree Radical Scavengersxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aGlycoside Hydrolase Inhibitors 2aPhenolsxchemistryxisolation & purificationxpharmacology. 2aSeasons 2aTemperature 2aalpha-Amylasesxantagonists & inhibitors 3aUnited States1 aKarayannakidis, Panagiotis D.1 aKwon, Young-In1 aLee, Chong M.1 aSeeram, Navindra P.0 tPlant foods for human nutrition.g2011 Nov., v. 66, no. 4 p.313-319dSpringer-Verlagx0921-96687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11130-011-0250-4  aDNAL 7aarticle02413naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245008900161300001600250520125800266592002801524650001301552650001101565650002501576650001801601650001201619650001601631650001301647650001301660650001601673650001701689650001001706650001501716651001701731651001201748700001401760700002101774700001801795700001701813773009201830856004801922852000901970655001201979IND50066808120221118045053.0130601e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006680812DNAL7 a10.1007/s11104-012-1478-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHenry, A.10aLand use effects on erosion and carbon storage of the Río Chimbo watershed, Ecuador  ap. 477-491.  aBACKGROUND AND AIMS: Soil carbon storage is an important component of global carbon cycling. Andean Andisols have high carbon content and are vulnerable to erosion because of agricultural intensification and deforestation. This study examines the effects of land use on erosion and soil carbon storage in the Río Chimbo watershed of Ecuador. METHODS: Soil carbon content, age, and erosion estimated from ¹³⁷Cs inventories was measured along an elevational transect under annual cropping, natural forest, páramo, pasture, and tree plantations. RESULTS: Land use, particularly annual cropping, affected ¹³⁷Cs levels in the upper soil layers, but did not have an impact on total carbon storage to a depth of 1 m. Relative erosion rates estimated from ¹³⁷Cs inventories at sites under annual cropping averaged 27 t ha⁻¹ y⁻¹ over the erosion rate of non-cultivated sites. A linear relationship was observed between soil carbon age (determined by ¹⁴C levels) and ¹³⁷Cs levels, where pasture sites had lower ¹³⁷Cs and older carbon compared to natural forest sites.

DESIGN: A randomized controlled trial. SETTING: University teaching hospital. PATIENT(S): Ten anovulatory women with PCOS and 5 fertile ovulatory women. INTERVENTION(S): Patients received 2.5 mg of letrozole on cycle days 3–7 (5 patients, 1 cycle) or 50 mg of CC on cycle days 5–9 (5 patients, 1 cycle). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Serum estrogen (E) and progesterone (P) endometrial protein and messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), dickkhopf homolog 1 (DKK-1), fibroblast growth factor 22 (FGF-22), and endometrial mRNA expression of LIF/GP130 receptor (LIFR). RESULT(S): No statistically significant differences were observed between groups compared with fertile ovulatory women when serum E and P were examined, or between body mass index (BMI), and cycle day at time of biopsy. Letrozole increased mRNA expression of LIF, DKK1, LIFR, and FGF-22, whereas CC only increased endometrial mRNA expression of LIF. Letrozole mRNA expression directly translated into increased protein expression of like genes in the endometrium. The CC protein expression of DKK-1 was significantly decreased compared with controls. CONCLUSION(S): Letrozole positively influences a number of markers of endometrial receptivity compared with CC.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal ovaries 3aanovulation 3abiopsy 3ablood serum 3abody mass index 3acitrates 3aendometrium 3afibroblast growth factors 3agene expression 3agenes 3aleukemia inhibitory factor 3amessenger RNA 3apatients 3apolycystic ovary syndrome 3aprogesterone 3aprotein synthesis 3arandomized clinical trials 3atranslation (genetics) 3awomen1 aJohnson, Venessia1 aSopelak, Victoria1 aHines, Randall0 tFertility and sterility.g2011 Oct., v. 96, no. 4 p.1051-1056dElsevier Inc.x0015-02827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fertnstert.2011.07.10923Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03442naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100004700152245012700199500001900326520175400345592002802099650002902127650001702156650003502173650001202208650002102220650001702241650000902258650001202267650001302279650001702292650002002309650000902329650001302338650001902351650002402370650001202394650002502406651001102431653002702442653002002469653002402489700003502513700003702548700002902585700003602614700003902650700001902689773009602708856008702804852000902891655001202900IND60733941520221122190540.0210603e20211001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073394152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.geoderma.2021.1151192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWilliams Araújo do Nascimento, Clístenes10aGeopedology-climate interactions govern the spatial distribution of selenium in soils: A case study in northeastern Brazil  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSelenium (Se) is an essential trace element in humans with critical roles in immune functioning and antioxidant systems. Plant foods growing on soils with sufficient Se levels are the primary dietary sources of selenium. Therefore, knowing the factors that drive the concentration of Se in soils is essential to map Se deficiencies and toxicities and implement biofortification programs to enhance foodstuffs' mineral composition. Here, we assessed how geopedology-climate interactions govern the background concentration and spatial distribution of Se in soils from two northeastern Brazil states. A soil geochemical survey covering roughly 110,000 km² collected 198 composite samples in sites with minimal anthropogenic influence and wide variation concerning soil types, geological and climatological settings. The samples had their Se concentrations determined by hydride generation atomic absorption spectroscopy (HGAAS) after microwave acid digestion. The results indicate that climate (precipitation) and bedrock are the main broad-scale factors on regional soil Se distribution, while soil contents of clay and organic matter influence Se values locally. Geographically weighted regression (GWR) showed that these factors change over space and exist in a spatial non-stationarity relationship with selenium. Se-deficient soils are most likely to occur in semi-arid settings overlying crystalline rocks, in which pedogenesis and climate drive low contents of clay and soil organic carbon, and Se air-borne inputs are low. The risk of inadequate Se intake by humans and animals in the region is high. This study can aid public policies addressing Se malnutrition in the study region and similar geopedological and climate settings worldwide.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropogenic activities 3aantioxidants 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3abedrock 3abiofortification 3acase studies 3aclay 3aclimate 3ahydrides 3amalnutrition 3amineral content 3arisk 3aselenium 3asoil formation 3asoil organic carbon 3asurveys 3awet digestion method 3aBrazil 0aAtmospheric deposition 0aHuman nutrition 0aSelenium deficiency1 aBruno Viera da Silva, Fernando1 ade Brito Fabricio Neta, Adelazil1 aMiranda Biondi, Caroline1 aAparecida da Silva Lins, Simone1 aBezerra de Almeida Júnior, Agenor1 aPreston, Welka0 tGeoderma.g2021 Oct. 01, v. 399 p.115119-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl16374x0016-70617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2021.1151193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02453naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245019000167300001300357520100800370592002801378650002501406650002601431650001301457650001701470650002301487650001601510650001701526650001801543650001301561653002801574653001601602653002501618653002401643653002701667700001701694700002101711700001501732700001601747700001701763773013101780856008701911852000901998655001202007IND60629091920221121062942.0200628e20190501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062909192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2019.01.0942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShen, Siqi12aA back-door Phenylalanine coordinates the stepwise hexameric loading of acyl carrier protein by the fatty acid biosynthesis enzyme β-hydroxyacyl-acyl carrier protein dehydratase (FabZ)  ap. 5-11.  aThe fatty acid biosynthesis pathway (FAS) was a fundamental procedure to generate a diversity of lipid components for cellular metabolism in bacteria, while the mechanism of substrate recognition remains unclear. The β-hydroxyacyl-acyl carrier protein dehydratase hexamer (FabZ) is an essential module in the elongation cycle of type-II FAS, catalyzing the dehydration of β-hydroxyacyl-lipid substrate carried by the holo form acyl carrier protein (holo-ACP). We previously elucidated an alternating seesaw-like ACP loading manner within a FabZ dimer subunits, mediated by a front-door residue Tyrosine (Tyr100). Here, we demonstrated that a back-door residue Phenylalanine (Phe83) of FabZ regulates the stepwise hexameric loading of ACP. Our finding represents clues as to the dynamic ACP recognition and catalysis mechanism of dehydratase in fatty acid biosynthesis, and provides critical information for developing antimicrobials targeting the dehydratase module in fatty acid biosynthesis pathway.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacyl carrier protein 3aanti-infective agents 3abacteria 3abiosynthesis 3acatalytic activity 3afatty acids 3ahydro-lyases 3aphenylalanine 3atyrosine 0aFatty acid biosynthesis 0aDehydratase 0aAcyl carrier protein 0aHelicobacter pylori 0aDynamic ACP regulation1 aHang, Xudong1 aZhuang, Jingjing1 aZhang, Lin1 aBi, Hongkai1 aZhang, Liang0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2019 May 01, v. 128 p.5-11dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2019.01.0943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02720naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002200146245015800168300001800326520109100344650002401435650001201459650002201471650001801493650003101511650001001542650003401552650001201586650001001598650001201608650001201620650002101632650001701653650001801670650002201688650002401710650000901734650002401743650001401767650001101781650001901792650003201811650001701843700002201860700001501882700002401897700002001921700002001941773016101961856004702122852000902169655001202178IND60523503520221120151906.0160621e20160601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052350352DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.6b006652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFukuda, Toshihiko10aAdenine Inhibits TNF-α Signaling in Intestinal Epithelial Cells and Reduces Mucosal Inflammation in a Dextran Sodium Sulfate-Induced Colitis Mouse Model  ap. 4227-4234.  aAdenine (6-amino-6H-purine), found in molokheiya (Corchorus olitorius L.), has exerted vasorelaxation effects in the thoracic aorta. However, the mode of action of the anti-inflammatory effect of adenine is unclear. Thus, we investigated to clarify the effect of adenine on chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. In intestinal epithelial cells, adenine significantly inhibited tumor necrosis factor-α-induced interleukin-8 secretion. The inhibition of adenine was abolished under the treatment of inhibitors of adenyl cyclase (AC) and protein kinase A (PKA), indicating the effect of adenine was mediated through the AC/PKA pathway. Adenine (5, 10, and 50 mg/kg BW/day) was administered orally for 14 days to female BALB/c mice, and then 5% dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) was given to induce colitis. Adenine (5 mg/kg BW/day) significantly prevented DSS-induced colon shortening, expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and histological damage in the colon. These results suggest that adenine can be a promising nutraceutical for the prevention of intestinal inflammation. 3aCorchorus olitorius 3aadenine 3aadenylate cyclase 3aanimal models 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3aaorta 3acAMP-dependent protein kinase 3acolitis 3acolon 3adextran 3afemales 3afunctional foods 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-8 3aintestinal mucosa 3amechanism of action 3amice 3aoral administration 3asecretion 3asodium 3asodium sulfate 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3avasodilation1 aMajumder, Kaustav1 aZhang, Hua1 aTurner, Patricia V.1 aMatsui, Toshiro1 aMine, Yoshinori0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2016 June 1, v. 64, no. 21 p.4227-4234dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Divisionx0021-85617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.6b00665  aDNAL 7aarticle02985naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002700145245013800172300001600310500001500326520154900341592002801890650001801918650002101936650003701957650002101994650002202015650002002037650001702057650001502074650001102089650001202100650001402112650001002126650003802136650002602174650002202200650001902222650001602241650001402257650001902271653002802290700002602318773010202344856004802446852000902494655001202503IND4469031020221119093535.0120727e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446903102DNAL7 a10.1007/s11738-011-0825-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbdel-Fattah, Gamal M.10aArbuscular mycorrhizal fungal application to improve growth and tolerance of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) plants grown in saline soil  ap. 267-277.  a2019-12-06  aA pot experiment was conducted to examine the effects of three different arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, Glomus mosseae, G. deserticola and Gigaspora gergaria, on growth and nutrition of wheat (Triticum aestivium L. cv. Henta) plants grown in saline soil. Under saline condition, mycorrhizal inoculation significantly increased growth responses, nutrient contents, acid and alkaline phosphatases, proline and total soluble protein of wheat plants compared to non-mycorrhizal ones. Those stimulations were related to the metabolic activity of the each mycorrhizal fungus. The localization of succinate dehydrogenase “SDH” (as a vital stain for the metabolically active fungus) in the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi was variable. In general, mycorrhizal shoot plant tissues had significantly higher concentrations of P, N, K and Mg but lower Na concentration than those of non-mycorrhizal plants. In saline soil, growth and nutrition of wheat plants showed a high degree of dependency on mycorrhizal fungi (especially G. mosseae). The use of the nitroblue tetrazolium chloride method as a vital stain for SDH activity showed that all the structures of mycorrhizal infections in the wheat plant estimated by the trypan blue staining (non-vital stain) were not metabolically active. Interestingly, the reduction in Na uptake along with associated increases in P, N and Mg absorption and high proline, phosphatase activities and chlorophyll content in the mycorrhizal plants could be important for salt alleviation in plants growing in saline soils.  aPublisher supplied data 3aplant tissues 3anutrient content 3avesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae 3aacid phosphatase 3amycorrhizal fungi 3aplant nutrition 3asaline soils 3aabsorption 3ashoots 3aproline 3achlorides 3awheat 3asuccinate dehydrogenase (quinone) 3anitroblue tetrazolium 3aTriticum aestivum 3aGlomus mosseae 3achlorophyll 3aGigaspora 3aplant proteins 0asuccinate dehydrogenase1 aAsrar, Abdul-Wasea A.0 tActa physiologiae plantarum.g2012 Jan., v. 34, no. 1 p.267-277dSpringer-Verlagx0137-58817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11738-011-0825-6  aDNAL 7aarticle02625naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245006600166300001400232520116900246592002801415650002001443650001401463650001401477650002701491650002001518650002101538650001201559650001601571650001601587650001701603650001701620650001701637650003001654650001601684650001301700650001401713650001901727653002701746653001901773653002801792700005601820700005901876773011701935856008202052852000902134655001202143IND60676774020221120172701.0200103e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067677402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfda.2019.11.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoh, Yen-Chun10aRecent advances in cancer chemoprevention with phytochemicals  ap. 14-37.  aOver the past few decades, phytochemicals widely present in edible plants have exhibited compelling positive biological impact on human health, including treating some cancers. In some cases, metabolites and artificially modified products of these natural compounds have shown better chemopreventive effects than their natural counterparts. Along with direct chemopreventive strategies using phytochemicals to treat cancer by leading to cell cycle arrest, autophagy and apoptosis, natural compounds have been shown to reverse adverse epigenetic regulation, including altering DNA methylation and histone modification, modulating miRNA expression, promoting expression of phase II enzyme for detoxification, balancing inflammation responses, recovering circadian rhythm from misalignment, and modifying gut microbiota. These have all become part of indirect but effective and novel strategies in cancer prevention using phytochemicals. Therefore, in this review, we are going to summarize some findings of phytochemicals in cancer chemoprevention via several distinct strategies, both to highlight promising treatments and to encourage new ideas for future studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA methylation 3aapoptosis 3aautophagy 3acell cycle checkpoints 3achemoprevention 3acircadian rhythm 3aenzymes 3aepigenetics 3afood plants 3ahistone code 3ahuman health 3ainflammation 3aintestinal microorganisms 3ametabolites 3amicroRNA 3aneoplasms 3aphytochemicals 0aCancer chemoprevention 0aGut microbiota 0aEpigenetic modification1 aHo, Chi-Tang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8273-20851 aPan, Min-Hsiung1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5188-70300 tYàowù shípǐn fēnxī.g2020 Jan., v. 28, no. 1 p.14-37dElsevier Taiwan LLC.wJournal:23274x1021-94987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfda.2019.11.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02778naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001500139245015200154300001600306500002000322520133900342592002801681650002701709650002001736650002601756650002501782650002301807650003501830650003701865650001201902650001201914650001801926650001201944650001501956650001401971700001501985700001702000700001302017700001602030700001102046700001302057700001502070700001802085773011102103856007302214852000902287655001202296IND60579482220221121061156.0170818e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057948222DNAL7 a10.1111/aab.123652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDong, S.S.10aPersistence of transgenes in wild rice populations depends on the interaction between genetic background of recipients and environmental conditions  ap. 202-213.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe persistence of transgenes in wild populations may cause unintended ecological consequences, and the possibility of transgenes' persistence and introgression is dependent on fitness performance of transgenic crop–wild hybrids. To investigate the effects of transgene and genotype × environment on the fitness of crop–wild rice hybrids, a total of 11 cross‐combination progenies between insect‐resistant transgene (CpTI and Bt/CpTI) rice lines and wild rice (Oryza rufipogon) were evaluated at different sites with contrasting insect treatments. The results showed that fitness performance varied between transgenic hybrids having different wild parents and under different environmental conditions, indicating that fitness effects of transgenes on hybrid progenies depend heavily on the genetic background of recipient plants and growing environment. Significant fitness advantages conferred by transgenes were found only in some hybrids under high insect pressure condition, demonstrating that the level of target insects in the field environment influences the persistence and spread of insect‐resistant transgenes in wild rice populations. These findings suggest that evolutionary fate of escaped transgenes is different in wild populations with diverse genetic backgrounds under various environmental conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus thuringiensis 3aOryza rufipogon 3aenvironmental factors 3aenvironmental impact 3agenetic background 3agenetically modified organisms 3agenotype-environment interaction 3ahybrids 3ainsects 3aintrogression 3aparents 3atransgenes 3awild rice1 aXiao, M.Q.1 aOuyang, D.X.1 aRong, J.1 aLu, B.‐R.1 aSu, J.1 aWang, F.1 aChen, J.K.1 aSong, Z.‐P.0 tAnnals of applied biology.g2017 Sept., v. 171, no. 2 p.202-213dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0003-47467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/aab.123653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01326naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100003000143245020100173300001800374520020200392592002800594650001100622650001300633650002100646653003000667653002200697653001400719653002700733700001400760773015200774856007700926852000901003655001201012IND60521658820221116214015.0160530e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052165882DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1981-09232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchneiderwind, Ruth G.

The drawbacks associated with recognized feedstocks necessitate the need to explore new feedstocks for biofuel production. Fish processing units and domestic markets generate millions of tons of lipid (30–35% w/w) rich fish discards every year. Apart from lipids (oil/fat), fish discards are also a possible source of biocatalyst (lipase) and heterogeneous chemical catalysts. However, these fish discards generally utilized to prepare animal feed and fertilizer, but the main bulk is dumped into the environment, causing pollution. In recent years, fish discards triggered as a promising alternative feedstock for the sustainable production of biofuel (biodiesel and biogas). Around 90% biodiesel yield had been noted from fish discards using base catalyst. This review mainly focuses on how the fish discards could be employed for biofuel production, fuel properties, advantages over other feedstocks, and prospects. Additionally, some factors, such as fish waste oil quality, biodiesel preparation method, alcohol to oil ratio, type and amount of catalyst, reaction temperature, and time influence conversion yield and quality of biodiesel from fish discard (oil) also a comprehensively reviewed. Thus, present communication is beneficial to a group of people working on the fish processing industries, fishery waste management, and biofuel production to reduce the negative impact of such high organic wastes and introduce the alternative renewable feedstock for biofuel production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalcohols 3abiocatalysts 3abiodiesel 3abiogas 3acarboxylic ester hydrolases 3adomestic markets 3aenergy 3afeeds 3afeedstocks 3afertilizers 3afish discards 3afish processing 3afish processing plants 3afish waste 3afossil fuels 3afuel production 3aglobal warming 3alipids 3aoils 3apollution 3atemperature 3awaste management 0aFish lipids 0aFatty acid composition 0aBiofuel production 0aFuel properties 0aBiojet fuel1 aKudre, Tanaji G.0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2020 Dec. 01, v. 275 p.122985-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1229853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03313naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092024003700113040001800150100002000168245005200188300001800240500002000258500000900278520136000287592002801647650001401675650001101689650001601700650001401716650002801730650001301758650002201771650002401793650001601817650001301833650001901846650002701865650003001892700001301922700001801935700002101953700001901974700001301993700001702006700001602023700001602039700001502055700001102070700001202081700001802093700001502111700002502126700002002151700001902171700001802190700002202208700001802230700002002248700001802268773012302286852000902409856011202418856008402530961001302614655001202627IND4438622320221121173517.0220513e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443862232DNAL7 a10113/433762hdl7 a10.2135/cropsci2009.09.05512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCampbell, B.

In addition to its fiber, the oil and protein portion of the cottonseed also represents significant economic value. To protect the worldwide economic value of cotton fiber and cotton byproducts, coordinated efforts to collect and maintain cotton genetic resources have increased over the last 100 yr. The classified genetic resources of cotton are extensive and include five tetraploid species in the primary gene pool, 20 diploid species in the secondary gene pool, and 25 diploid species in the tertiary gene pool. This report provides information on the status and contents of eight major cotton germplasm collections present across the world. Based on the findings of this report, a number of classified Gossypium species are not maintained in these collections, and several are underrepresented and vulnerable to extinction. This report presents several critical challenges and opportunities facing international efforts to enhance and preserve the world's Gossypium genetic resources. Multinational communication and collaboration are essential to protect, secure, and evaluate the global cotton germplasm resources. Without global, collaborative efforts, the rarest and most unique cotton germplasm resources are vulnerable to extinction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGossypium 3acotton 3afiber crops 3agermplasm 3aplant genetic resources 3agenotype 3agenetic variation 3acottonseed products 3atetraploidy 3adiploidy 3awild relatives 3agermplasm conservation 3ainternational cooperation1 aSaha, S.1 aPercy, Roger,1 aFrelichowski, J.1 aJenkins, J.

We have hypothesized that graminoids with opportunistic nutrient‐acquisition strategies are strongly influenced by nutrient limitation imposed by microbes, whereas growth forms such as dwarf shrubs are less affected by the mobilization–immobilization cycles in microbes. By adding NPK fertilizer, labile C (sugar) and fungicide (benomyl) over a 5 yr period in a fully factorial design, we aimed to manipulate the sink–source potential for nutrients in a non‐acidic heath tundra soil. After 2 yr, N and P accumulated in the microbial biomass after fertilization with no change in microbial C, which suggests that nutrients did not limit microbial biomass growth. After 5 yr, microbial C was enhanced by 60% in plots with addition of labile C, which points to C‐limitation of the microbial biomass. Microbial biomass N and P tended to increase following addition of labile C, by 10 and 25%, respectively. This caused decreased availability of NH₄⁺ and P, showing close microbial control of nutrient availability. The most common graminoid, Festuca ovina, responded to fertilizer addition with a strong increase, and to labile C addition with a strong decrease in cover, providing the first direct field evidence that nutrient limitation imposed by immobilizing microbes can affect the growth of tundra plants. Also in support of our hypothesis, following addition of labile C the concentrations of N and K in leaves and that of N in roots of F. ovina decreased, whilst the demand of roots for P increased. In contrast, the most common dwarf shrub, Vaccinium uliginosum, was only slightly sensitive to changes in resource availability, showing no cover change after 4 yr addition of labile C and fertilizer, and little change in leaf nutrient concentrations. We suggest that the differential responses of the two growth forms are due to differences in storage and nutrient uptake pathways, with the dwarf shrub having large nutrient storage capacity and access to organic forms of N through its mycorrhizal association. While the fungicide had no effect on ericoid mycorrhizal colonization of roots or symbiotic function inferred from plant ¹⁵N natural abundance, it decreased microbial biomass C and N after 2 yr. Throughout the fifth season, the availability of soil NO₃⁻ and inorganic P was decreased with no change in microbial biomass C, N or P, suggesting a negative impact of benomyl on N and P mineralization.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFestuca ovina 3aNPK fertilizers 3aVaccinium uliginosum 3abenomyl 3afungicides 3agraminoids 3agrasses 3alabile carbon 3aleaves 3amicrobial biomass 3amineralization 3anutrient availability 3anutrient uptake 3ashrubs 3asugars 3atundra 3atundra soils1 aGRAGLIA, ENRICO1 aSCHMIDT, INGER K.1 aJONASSON, SVEN1 aSLEEP, DARREN1 aQUARMBY, CHRIS0 tnew phytologist.g1999 Sept., v. 143, no. 3 p.523-538dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl44665x0028-646X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1469-8137.1999.00479.x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02546naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002700141245008800168500001400256520126000270592002801530650001301558650002801571650001001599650002001609650001101629650001001640650000901650650001501659650001401674650002601688650001001714700002001724700002401744700002601768700003301794700003301827700003001860700001901890773011901909856007502028852000902103655001202112IND60702238220221120085424.0200717e20200526xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070223822DNAL7 a10.3390/ani100609252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFernandez-Novo, Aitor 10aPregnancy Loss (28–110 Days of Pregnancy) in Holstein Cows: A Retrospective Study  aNAL-light  aThe objective of this retrospective study was to investigate the prevalence of pregnancy loss (PL; between 28–110 pregnancy days) and its relationship with factors: farm, year (2015–2018), season, artificial insemination (AI)-rank, parity, AI-type (fixed-time vs. oestrus-AI), previous PL, days in milk (DIM), fixed-time-AI protocol, AI-technician, bull, and semen-type (sexed vs. conventional). Data of 19,437 Holstein cattle AIs from eight Spanish farms were studied. Overall conception rate was 34.3% (6696/19,437) and PL 12.3% (822/6696). The PL was more likely to occur in primiparous (10.8%, odds ratio (OR) = 1.35; p = 0.04) and multiparous (15.3%; OR = 2.02, p < 0.01) than in heifers (PL = 6.9%, reference). Pregnancies achieved with AI after observed oestrus and natural breedings were associated with less PL than pregnancies after fixed-time-AI (12.7 vs. 11.9%; OR = 0.12, p = 0.01). First AIs related to higher PL than ≥2nd AIs (PL = 13.8% vs. 11.2; OR = 0.73, p < 0.01). The factors season, fixed-time-AI protocol, DIM, bull, AI-technician, or type of semen were not significantly associated with PL. Therefore, farmers and consultants should adapt their preventive strategies relating to PL, particularly, to the parity of the cattle.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolstein 3aartificial insemination 3abulls 3aconception rate 3aestrus 3afarms 3amilk 3aodds ratio 3apregnancy 3aretrospective studies 3asemen1 aFargas, Octavi 1 aLoste, Juan  Manuel1 aSebastian, Francisco 1 aPerez-Villalobos, Natividad 1 aPesantez-Pacheco, Jose  Luis1 aPatron-Collantes, Raquel 1 aAstiz, Susana 0 tAnimals.g2020 May 26, v. 10, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani100609253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02739naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005700152245013400209300001400343520151300357592002801870650002001898650001401918650001101932651001601943651001101959653001901970653002201989653002002011653002502031700001802056700002102074700002102095700002002116700002502136773009602161856008702257852000902344655001202353IND60628396920221123045314.0190320e20190401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062839692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.geomorph.2019.01.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPetit, Carole1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8798-116810aRiver incision and migration deduced from 36Cl cosmic-ray exposure durations: The Clue de la Cerise gorge in southern French Alps  ap. 81-88.  aWe estimate recent (20 ka) incision and lateral migration rate on a spectacular ~N-S striking gorge cross-cutting N-dipping limestones in a fold-and-thrust belt of the external Southern French Alps. Upstream of the gorge, the river makes a right angle turn and follows the limestone surface parallel to the bedding direction (~EW). Eighteen samples were gathered along two vertical river polished profiles and three others on the denuded north-dipping surface layer, in order to determine river incision and lateral migration timing and rates. Surface age exposures of polished river cliff and bedding surface have been obtained from 36Cl cosmogenic nuclide dating and allow us to constrain the rate of vertical incision and of surface denudation of the Jurassic limestone layer. Fifteen 36Cl exposure ages have been obtained and range from ~21 ka to ~3 ka. Samples clearly define two age/height linear trends, which slopes correspond to incision rates of 1 and 0.3 mm/yr, respectively. The transition from low to high incision rate occurs at about ~12 ka, i.e. during the Younger Dryas glacial phase. Data also indicate that the vertical incision of the N-S branch of the gorge is coeval with the lateral (northward) river migration of its E-W branch associated with the denudation of the limestones surface. Extrapolating incision rates deduced from 36Cl exposure ages through time suggests that the incision of the Clue and denudation of the Jurassic limestones started about 500–600 ka ago.  aPublisher supplied data 3aJurassic period 3alimestone 3arivers 3aAlps region 3aFrance 0aRiver incision 0aLateral migration 0aLate Quaternary 0aSouthern French Alps1 aRolland, Yann1 aBraucher, Régis1 aBourlès, Didier1 aGuillou, Valery1 aPetitperrin, Vincent0 tGeomorphology.g2019 Apr. 01, v. 330 p.81-88dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12407x0169-555X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geomorph.2019.01.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03154naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001600138245015800154520173800312592002802050650002102078650002602099650001202125650001102137650001502148650002202163650001202185650002102197650001402218650001702232650001602249650001502265650001902280650002102299650002702320650001802347650002102365651001002386700001302396700001802409700001602427700001502443700001302458773012002471856007202591852000902663655001202672IND60648807320221120090028.0190701e20171112xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064880732DNAL7 a10.3390/f81104282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShen, Yafei10aShort-Term Effects of Low Intensity Thinning on the Fine Root Dynamics of <em>Pinus massoniana</em> Plantations in the Three Gorges Reservoir Area, China  aFine roots play an important role in plant growth as well as carbon (C) and nutrient cycling in terrestrial ecosystems. Fine roots are important for understanding the contribution of forests to the global C cycle. Knowledge about this topic is still limited, especially regarding the effects of different forest management practices. This study investigated the seasonal dynamics of fine roots (<2 mm) in masson pine (P. massoniana) plantations for one year after low intensity thinning by using a sequential soil coring method. The fine roots showed pronounced seasonal dynamics, with a peak of fine root biomass (FRB) occurring in September. Significant differences were noted in the seasonal dynamics of FRB for the different diameter size sub-classes (≤0.5 mm, 0.5–1 mm and 1–2 mm); also FRB was inversely related to soil depth. Moreover, the FRB (≤0.5 mm and 0.5–1 mm except 1–2 mm) in the thinning plots was greater than that in the control only in the upper soil layer (0–10 cm). Furthermore, the FRB varied significantly with soil temperature, moisture and nutrients depended on the diameter sub-class considered. Significant differences in the soil temperature and moisture levels were noted between low-intensity thinned and control plots. Soil nutrient levels slightly decreased after low-intensity thinning. In addition, there was a more sensitive relationship between the very fine roots (diameter < 0.5 mm) and soil nutrients. Our results showed an influence of low-intensity thinning on the fine root dynamics with a different magnitude according to fine root diameter sub-classes. These results provide a theoretical basis to promote the benefits of C cycling in the management of P. massoniana forests.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus massoniana 3abiogeochemical cycles 3abiomass 3acarbon 3afine roots 3aforest management 3aforests 3anutrient content 3anutrients 3aplant growth 3aplantations 3asoil depth 3asoil nutrients 3asoil temperature 3aterrestrial ecosystems 3awater content 3awater reservoirs 3aChina1 aWang, Na1 aCheng, Ruimei1 aXiao, Wenfa1 aYang, Shao1 aGuo, Yan0 tForests.g2017 Nov. 12, v. 8, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f81104283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02589naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245010700168520144600275592002801721650002301749650002201772650001201794650001801806650001101824650001801835650001301853651001001866653001201876653002101888653001801909653002801927653001001955700001301965700001701978773011301995856008602108852000902194655001202203IND60702683620221119110342.0220719e20201210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070268362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1229882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Jingbo10aValuing wetland ecosystem services based on benefit transfer: A meta-analysis of China wetland studies  aWhile wetlands contribute significantly to ecosystem services, their nature as a public good implies that the public sector, rather than the market, values their conservation, utilization, and trade-offs among various ecosystem services. Thus, the valuation of wetlands and their ecosystem services is important for policy makers. This study conducts a meta-analysis of valuation research on China’s wetlands based on 133 independent studies involving 146 cases published during 2000–2017. The study evaluates the weight of different factors in the existing valuation results, discusses the errors of benefit transfer, and applies the benefit transfer method to evaluate the ecosystem services of Yancheng wetland in Jiangsu province. The primary results are as follows. Wetland size influences wetland service valuation results most significantly. The value of all ecosystem services increases as wetland area increases with an average elasticity of 0.83. Factors such as economic and social development level, wetland type, research time, literature source, and valuation methods have impacts only on several individual service types. It is feasible to apply the meta-analysis results to benefit transfer. Compared with the per unit area value model, which is more stable in transfer errors, the wetland service value has better goodness of fit. Therefore,in conducting benefit transfer, the wetland service value models are suggested.  aPublisher supplied data 3aecosystem services 3aissues and policy 3amarkets 3ameta-analysis 3amodels 3apublic sector 3awetlands 3aChina 0aWetland 0aBenefit transfer 0aMeta-analysis 0aEcosystem service value 0aChina1 aWu, Jian1 aGong, Yazhen0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2020 Dec. 10, v. 276 p.122988-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1229883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02500naa a2200265 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075024005100099040001800150100001600168245009900184300001400283500000900297520158100306592002801887650002101915650002301936650001601959700002101975773011901996852000902115856009802124655001202222991574755310742620221122194401.0191122e197401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7490320682DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci1974.0011183X001400010004x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLawn, R.

Merr.] varieties, ‘Chippewa 64’ and ‘Clay,’ was measured at 7 to 10 day intervals starting at flowering, using the acetylene reduction assay. At he end of flowering, treatments were applied which were designed to alter the relationship between the photosynthetic source and sink components in the plants. The treatments were supplemental light, 25% shade, 50% depodding, 60% defoliation, and control. Total acetylene reduction activity per plant increased in both varieties during the flowering period, reached a maximum near the end of flowering, and then declined markedly during the early podfilling stage. The activity decline was due to a decline in the specific activity of the nodules, and occurred immediately prior to the time when the growth rate of the pods (including seed) exceeded that of the total plant tops in the respective varieties. Treatments designed to enhance he photosynthetic source/sink ratio (supplemental light and depodding) maintained nodule activity well above the control in both varieties. Conversely, treatments designed to reduce the source/sink ratio (shading and defoliation) decreased nodule activity below the level of the control. Treatment effects on total plant protein recovered at maturity closely reflected the treatment effects on total nodule activity. The results of this study are interpreted as evidence that symbiotic nitrogen fixation in these varieties declined during podfilling as the result of inadequate assimilate supply to the nodules.  aPublisher supplied data 3aplant physiology 3aplant biochemistry 3afield crops1 aBrun, William A.0 tCrop science.g1974 Jan., v. 14, no. 1 p.11-16dCrop Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44570x0011-183X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2135/cropsci1974.0011183X001400010004x3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02143naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245012100175300001400296520089100310592002801201650001201229650002501241650002101266650001201287650001301299650001101312650001701323650002901340650001201369650001701381650001501398651001001413653001801423653001701441653002101458653001101479653001901490700001701509773009001526856008401616852000901700655001201709IND60547571420221120071457.0160903s2015    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054757142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.proenv.2015.07.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRistanti, Eky Yenita10aLesson Learned from Government and Private-sponsored ‘Woody Biomass’ Project —case Study of Shimokawa and Hita  ap. 21-26.  aThis study is aimed at synthesizing the social value-based model of Shimokawa, Hokkaido with economic value-based model of Hita, Oita to implement woody biomass renewable energy business in Japan.

The adjustable density of chromatin also regulates gene expression, thus this post-genetic molecular mechanism is one of the routes by which phenotype is shaped. Phenotypes that arise without a concomitant mutation of the underlying genome are termed epigenetic phenomena. Here we discuss epigenetic phenomena from histone and DNA modification as it pertains to the dynamic regulatory processes of the circadian clock. Epigenetic phenomena certainly explain some regulatory aspects of the mammalian circadian oscillator.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3achromatin 3acircadian rhythm 3aepigenetics 3agene expression 3agenome 3ahistones 3amammals 3amutation 3aphenotype1 aMerrow, Martha0 tFEBS letters.g2011 May 20, v. 585, no. 10 p.1406-1411dElsevier B.V.x0014-57937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.febslet.2011.04.0473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02925naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002200112245010500134300001600239506002800255520171800283592002802001506003702029650000802066650001902074650000902093650001902102650002202121650001602143650002702159650000902186650002002195650002402215650001702239650001502256653001502271653001602286653001502302700001902317700001702336773014102353852000902494655001202503IND60785624120221207115630.0160915e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078562412DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aÖrüng, İbrahim12aA research on ventilation efficiency of piped ventilation systems in geothermally heated greenhouses  ap. 164-170.  aResource is Open Access  aGreenhouse play significant roles in human nutrition. Vegetable and fruit consumption at certain amounts is the basic pre-condition for a well nutrition. It is possible to produce sufficient quantities of fruits and vegetables in places with available climate conditions. However, fruits and vegetables should be grown in special buildings to have a year-long production in places without available climate conditions. These places include under-cover production facilities, greenhouses, low and high tunnel facilities. Environmental conditions are adjusted are adjusted in greenhouses as to provide proper conditions for plant growth and development. Ventilation is used to remove excess heat, moisture and carbon dioxide from the greenhouses. Either natural or mechanical ventilation is used in greenhouses. Mechanical ventilation systems have various advantages over natural systems. However, mostly natural ventilation systems are preferred because of their low installation and operational costs. Both systems operates based on negative pressure. Air exchange rates are usually low in winters and it is quite hard to evenly distribute cold fresh air within the greenhouse. Air inlets are usually placed over side walls and outlets are commonly placed along the ridge. In this study an alternative natural ventilation system was proposed for more efficient ventilation of the greenhouses. In this system, fresh air gets into the greenhouse through ventilation pipes installed beneath the greenhouse floor. The incoming fresh air also heated with geothermal hot water lines, thus direct contact of cold fresh air is prevented. The design and efficiency of piped ventilation systems were provided in this paper.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aair 3acarbon dioxide 3acold 3adirect contact 3afruit consumption 3agreenhouses 3agrowth and development 3aheat 3ahuman nutrition 3anatural ventilation 3aplant growth 3avegetables 0aGreenhouse 0aventilation 0ageothermal1 aKaraman, Sedat1 aSirin, Ünal0 tCurrent Trends in Natural Sciences.g2016 July, v. 5, no. 9 p.164-170dEditura Universitatii din PitestiwJournal:27829x2284-953X7nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle04420naa a2200853 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003000133040001800163100002600181245015100207300001800358500002400376506007600400520149200476506003701968650002602005650001802031650001402049650001302063650001602076650001302092650001202105650001202117650002102129650002002150650002102170650002102191650002102212650003002233650001202263650001802275650003002293650001402323650001702337650001602354650001402370650002702384650003102411650001202442650004402454650001402498650003002512650002302542650001502565650001502580650003802595650004002633650001102673650001602684650001702700650003102717650002802748650003502776650003402811650005102845650004802896650000902944650000902953650004202962650006203004650008703066650003003153650008603183700001703269773011803286852000903404856008003413856006103493655001203554IND4395317420221207144547.0070923s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439531742DNAL7 a176203492pmid7 aPMC20445512pmcid7 a10.1128/IAI.00725-072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIvory, Catherine P.A.10aIntranasal Immunization with Gal-Inhibitable Lectin plus an Adjuvant of CpG Oligodeoxynucleotides Protects against Entamoeba histolytica Challenge  ap. 4917-4922.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe development of an effective amebiasis vaccine could improve child health in the developing world, reducing cases of amebic colitis and liver abscess. An ideal vaccine would be comprised of a well-characterized parasite antigen and an adjuvant, which would have high potency while driving the immune response in a Th1 direction. This study describes a mucosal vaccine composed of the Entamoeba histolytica galactose/N-acetyl-D-galactosamine-inhibitable lectin (Gal-lectin) and CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG-ODN). The Gal-lectin is a protein involved in parasite virulence and adherence and is known to activate immune cells, while CpG-ODN are known to be potent inducers of type 1-like immune responses. We demonstrated that intranasal administration of the vaccine resulted in strong Gal-lectin-specific Th1 responses and humoral responses. Vaccination induced the production of Gal-lectin-specific T cells and the production of the proinflammatory cytokine gamma interferon. Vaccinated animals had detectable serum anti-Gal-lectin immunoglobulin G (IgG) and stool anti-Gal-lectin IgA capable of blocking parasite adherence to target cells in vitro. One week after immunization, gerbils were challenged intrahepatically with live trophozoites. Vaccinated gerbils had no detectable abscesses after day 5, whereas control gerbils developed larger abscesses. These results show that mucosal vaccination with Gal-lectin and CpG-ODN can induce both systemic and humoral immune responses.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEntamoeba histolytica 3aT-lymphocytes 3aamebiasis 3aantigens 3ablood serum 3achildren 3acolitis 3agerbils 3ahumoral immunity 3aimmune response 3aimmunoglobulin A 3aimmunoglobulin G 3ainterferon-gamma 3aintranasal administration 3alectins 3aliver abscess 3aoligodeoxyribonucleotides 3aparasites 3atrophozoites 3avaccination 3avirulence 2aAdjuvants, Immunologic 2aAdministration, Intranasal 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Protozoanxanalysisxblood. 2aCHO Cells 2aCell Adhesionximmunology 2aCell Proliferation 2aCricetinae 2aCricetulus 2aEntamoeba histolyticaximmunology 2aEntamoebiasisxprevention & control 2aFemale 2aGerbillinae 2aImmunization 2aImmunoglobulin Axanalysis 2aImmunoglobulin Gxblood 2aInterferon-gammaxbiosynthesis 2aIntestinal Mucosaximmunology 2aLectinsximmunologyxisolation & purification. 2aLiver Abscess, Amebicxprevention & control 2aMale 2aMice 2aOligodeoxyribonucleotidesximmunology 2aProtozoan Proteinsximmunologyxisolation & purification. 2aProtozoan Vaccinesxadministration & dosageximmunologyxisolation & purification. 2aT-Lymphocytesximmunology 2aVaccines, Subunitxadministration & dosageximmunologyxisolation & purification.1 aChadee, Kris0 tInfection and immunity.g2007 Oct., v. 75, no. 10 p.4917-4922dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0019-95677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/IAI.00725-073Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://iai.asm.org/3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03934naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003000133040001800163100002400181245016000205300001800365500002400383506007600407520165300483506003702136650002202173650001802195650003902213650001602252650002002268650001102288650000902299650001202308650001302320650001902333650001402352650001202366650005202378650001802430650001402448650003302462650003502495650002802530650006402558650004202622650005102664650002502715650001302740650004402753650001902797650005202816650003402868650002402902650004702926700002002973700002302993773011803016852000903134856008003143856006103223655001203284IND4395316920221207144533.0070923s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439531692DNAL7 a176358702pmid7 aPMC20445432pmcid7 a10.1128/IAI.00550-072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKendall, Melissa M.10aGlobal Effects of the Cell-to-Cell Signaling Molecules Autoinducer-2, Autoinducer-3, and Epinephrine in a luxS Mutant of Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli  ap. 4875-4884.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIntrakingdom cell-to-cell communication and interkingdom cell-to-cell communication play essential roles in the virulence of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC). Four signals, autoinducer 2 (AI-2), AI-3, and the human hormones epinephrine and norepinephrine, are important in this communication. The effect of these signaling compounds on the transcriptome of EHEC was examined in this study. We demonstrated that the luxS mutation affects primarily central metabolic genes in both pathogenic and nonpathogenic strains of E. coli and that addition of exogenous AI-2 does not fully restore the expression profile in a luxS-deficient strain lacking the ability to synthesize AI-2. Addition of AI-3 or epinephrine increased expression of the locus of enterocyte effacement regulon, which is known to play a pivotal role in EHEC virulence. Moreover, when epinephrine was added to the culture medium, the greatest number of gene alterations was observed. These alterations included a greater proportion of alterations in EHEC genes than in MG1655 genes, suggesting that epinephrine may be a global virulence signal. Detailed examination with real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) confirmed the increases in virulence gene expression with addition of AI-3 and epinephrine. Additional studies with real-time RT-PCR examining the EHEC secreted effectors and putative fimbrial gene expression showed a variable expression profile, indicating that there is differential regulation of the secreted molecules. This study began to examine the global signaling networks in EHEC and revealed expression profiles that are signal and pathogen specific.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aavirulent strains 3aculture media 3aenterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli 3aepinephrine 3agene expression 3ahumans 3aloci 3amutants 3amutation 3anorepinephrine 3apathogens 3aregulon 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3atranscriptome 3avirulence 2aBacterial Proteinsxgenetics 2aCarbon-Sulfur Lyasesxgenetics 2aEpinephrinexmetabolism 2aEscherichia coli O157xgeneticsxmetabolismxpathogenicity. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Bacterial 2aHomoserinexanalogs & derivativesxmetabolism. 2aLactonesxmetabolism 2aMutation 2aOligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis 2aQuorum Sensing 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aSignal Transductionxgenetics 2aVirulencexgenetics 2aVirulence Factorsxbiosynthesisxgenetics.1 aRasko, David A.1 aSperandio, Vanessa0 tInfection and immunity.g2007 Oct., v. 75, no. 10 p.4875-4884dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0019-95677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/IAI.00550-073Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://iai.asm.org/3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01586naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002000152245011800172300001800290500002400308520056400332650002500896650001900921650001700940650001100957700002700968700002100995700002601016700002501042773010401067852000901171856009201180655001201272IND4395107520221118014350.0070916s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439510752DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1567-1364.2007.00255.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDemkiv, Olha M.10aFormaldehyde dehydrogenase from the recombinant yeast Hansenula polymorpha: isolation and bioanalytic application  ap. 1153-1159.  aIncludes references  aA recombinant yeast clone, a derivative of the recipient Hansenula polymorpha strain NCYC 495, was chosen as an NAD and glutathione-dependent formaldehyde dehydrogenase overproducer.

Besides its function as an enzyme, Pyc1p is required for assembly of peroxisomal alcohol oxidase (AO). Hence, Pyc1p-deficient cells share aspartate auxotrophy (Asp⁻) with a defect in growth on methanol as sole carbon source (Mut⁻). To identify regions in Hansenula polymorpha Pyc1p that are required for the function of HpPyc1p in AO assembly, a series of random mutations was generated in the HpPYC1 gene by transposon mutagenesis. Upon introduction of 18 mutant genes into the H. polymorpha PYC1 deletion strain (pyc1), four different phenotypes were obtained, namely Asp⁻ Mut⁻, Asp⁻ Mut⁺, Asp⁺ Mut⁻, and Asp⁺ Mut⁺. One mutant showed an Asp⁺ Mut⁻ phenotype. This mutant produced HpPyc1p containing a pentapeptide insertion in the region that links the conserved N-terminal biotin carboxylation domain (BC) with the central transcarboxylation (TC) domain. Three mutants that were Asp⁻ Mut⁻ contained insertions in the TC domain, suggesting that this domain is important for both functions of Pyc1p. Analysis of a series of constructed C-terminal and N-terminal truncated versions of HpPyc1p showed that the TC domain of Pyc1p, including the region linking this domain to the BC domain, is essential for AO assembly. 3aHansenula polymorpha 3aalcohol oxidase 3aaspartic acid 3abiotin 3acarbon 3acarboxylation 3agenes 3amethanol 3amutagenesis 3amutants 3aphenotype 3apyruvate carboxylase 3atransposons 3ayeasts1 aKlompmaker, Sandra H.1 aVisser, Nina1 aVeenhuis, Marten1 avan der Klei, Ida J.0 tFEMS yeast research.g2007 Oct., v. 7, no. 7 p.1082-1092dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1567-13567nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1567-1364.2007.00214.x3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02184naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002600092040001800118100003100136245008000167300001600247500002400263520101900287650001901306650001901325650001401344650002501358650001701383650001901400650004101419650001501460650001101475650002201486650001201508650000901520650002101529650001501550700002301565773011301588852000901701856007601710655001201786IND4394666120221118014147.0070902s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439466612DNAL7 a10.1002/ffj.18202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHongratanaworakit, Tapanee10aChemical composition and stimulating effect of Citrus hystrix oil on humans  ap. 443-449.  aIncludes references  aKaffir lime essential oil was obtained from fresh peels of Citrus hystrix (Rutaceae) by hydrodistillation and analysed by GC and GC-MS.

The kaffir lime oil caused a significant increase in blood pressure and a significant decrease in skin temperature. Regarding the behavioural parameters, subjects in the kaffir lime oil group rated themselves more alert, attentive, cheerful and vigorous than subjects in the control group. These findings are likely to represent stimulating/activating effects of the kaffir lime oil and provide some evidence for the use of kaffir lime oil in aromatherapy, such as causing relief from depression and stress in humans. 3aCitrus hystrix 3ablood pressure 3abreathing 3achemical composition 3acitrus peels 3aessential oils 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3aheart rate 3ahumans 3ahydrodistillation 3amassage 3aoils 3askin temperature 3avolunteers1 aBuchbauer, Gerhard0 tFlavour and fragrance journal.g2007 Sept., v. 22, no. 5 p.443-449dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x0882-57347nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ffj.18203Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01467naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002600092040001800118100001700136245007900153300001600232500002400248520038900272650001100661650002300672650001900695650004100714650001500755650002200770650001100792650000900803651001100812700002000823700001400843700001500857700002300872773011300895852000901008856007601017655001201093IND4394665820221118014325.0070902s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439466582DNAL7 a10.1002/ffj.18172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarrer, R.P.10aEssential oil variation among Brazilian accessions of Salvia guaranitica L  ap. 430-434.  aIncludes references  aThe oil from leaves of Salvia guaranitica Benth. accessions from southern Brazil obtained by hydrodistillation is reported.

TUGS model employs Wilcock and Crowe's (2003) bedload transport equation for simulation of gravel and sand transport, and is capable of simulating the dynamics of bed material grain size distributions, including the fractions of sand in the deposits. The model has been examined with three large-scale flume experiments and a flushing flow flume experiment with good agreements in bed profiles, gravel characteristic grain sizes and fractions of sand in the deposits. These examinations, along with descriptions of model development, are presented in a manuscript submitted concomitantly elsewhere (Cui, 2007), and this paper expands model examinations to a natural river. Eight runs are conducted with the Sandy River, Oregon as the prototype river, focusing on the responses of bed material grain size distributions under different hydrologic and sediment supply conditions. Simulation with the recorded discharge and the best understanding of sediment supply in the Sandy River produced good agreement in river longitudinal profile. This simulation also produced decreased median grain size and increased sand fraction in the downstream direction that match well with the general observations in the field. Examinations with varied sand supply indicate that bed material sand fractions are positively correlated with sand supply. Examinations with varied water discharge indicate that increased discharge under the same sediment supply conditions results in decreased bed material sand fraction. Examination of a hypothetical backwater effect from the Columbia River indicates that backwater effect results in increases in bed material sand fractions. Simulation of the sedimentation process upstream of a 14-m tall dam during dam operation produced similar current bed profile and a stratified sediment deposit very similar to those observed in the field.

Twenty seven different fatty acids were determined in the composition of Vimba vimba tenella. Monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) were found to be in higher amounts than saturated fatty acids (SFAs) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in all seasons. Oleic acid (C18:1 n9) was the major MUFA in all seasons. Palmitic acid (C16:0) was identified as the major SFA in all four seasons. Arachidonic acid (C20:4 n6), docosahexaenoic acid (C22:6 n3), linoleic acid (C18:2 n6), and eicosapentaenoic acid (C20:5 n3) were at the highest levels among the PUFAs. In the present study, n-3/n-6 ratios were found to be 1.4,1.5,1.2 and 1.4 in spring, summer, autumn and winter, respectively. Vimba vimba tenella may be a valuable food for human consumption in terms of fatty acids. 3aseasonal variation 3afatty acid composition 3alakes 3afreshwater fish 3amonounsaturated fatty acids 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 3afood analysis 3afood composition 3aomega-3 fatty acids 3aTurkey (country) 0aVimba vimba tenella1 aKıssal, Seçil1 aAktumsek, Abdurrahman0 tFood chemistry.g2009 Oct. 1, v. 116, no. 3 p.728-730dElsevier Sciencex0308-81467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2009.03.0163Available from publisher's Web site  a20090722b20090801c00000000  aINDd3CTe2009/06/29  aNon-US 7aarticle02326naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150072000900159100001700168245009800185300001600283500002400299520091100323650002101234650001601255650002001271650002001291650000901311650001301320650002901333650001801362650002501380650002401405650002801429650002101457650001801478650002101496653002801517700001801545700002001563773009301583852000901676856009001685930003301775945002501808946001101833655001201844IND4421100820221118014805.0090529e20091001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442110082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2009.03.0652doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ122 0aQ5021 aCandogan, K.10aEffect of starter culture on proteolytic changes during processing of fermented beef sausages  ap. 731-737.  aIncludes references  aFermented beef sausages inoculated with four different starter cultures (Pediococcus acidilactici, Lactobacillus curvatus, Lactobacillus sake, or Streptomyces griseus) were evaluated for proteolysis during process stages (prefermentation, fermentation, drying and heating). Increases (p <=0.05) in the nonprotein nitrogen (NPN) fraction were found at sequential stages of processing, while starter cultures had no major effects on NPN content. Concentrations of most free amino acids increased (p <=0.05) during fermentation and drying, and culture effects were found for differences among concentrations of some individual free amino acids. From SDS-PAGE analysis of sarcoplasmic and myofibrillar protein fractions after fermentation and drying, myosin heavy and light chains, actin and troponin were degraded during processing.

Four free-living fish were identified as wild by their fatty acids profile, n3/n6 ratio and by principal component analysis. To identify the farm of origin of farmed salmon, Bayesian belief networks (BBN) and support vector machines (SVM) were the best methods classifying correctly 58 (BBN and GC) and 56 (SVM and ¹³C NMR) of the 59 reference samples. Of the 12 free-living fish identified as farmed, four seemed to originate from farm 2 and 3 from farm 4.

The survey present here is an accurate reflection of folate consumed as all food samples were prepared ready for consumption. 3anutrient intake 3anutrient content 3afood groups 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aprepared foods 3afolic acid 3adietary surveys 3aUnited Kingdom 0adiet 0a5-methyltetrahydrofolate1 aBuss, D.H.1 aLoughridge, J.1 aLeeming, R.J.1 aHughes, K.1 aBlair, J.A.0 tJournal of human nutrition and dietetics.g1992 Aug., v. 5, no. 4 p.237-244x0952-38717nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aNon-US 7aarticle01318naa a2200277 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001600115245004200131300001200173500001500185520059100200650002200791650001700813650002300830653002100853653001400874773007900888852000900967939003300976945000801009946001101017655001201028991628141410742620221118014643.0921029s1992    xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI920033062DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDowning, D.10aEditorial policy and medical progress  ap. 3-6.  a2019-12-04  aThis Editorial expresses the opinion that in terms of clinical practice, nutrition is a "step-child" of the medical profession and that patient care suffers from "the almost complete neglect by the medical profession at large of the published literature on the potent therapeutic impact of diets and nutrients."

Owing to the presence of BT disease and its vectors in countries adjacent to Switzerland, an initial entomological survey was conducted in 2003, which established the presence of several midges of the genus Culicoides (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae). Subsequently, a sentinel herd monitoring system was established with the primary entomological aim being the determination and further study of Culicoides population compositions. Insects were collected in 2005 and 2006 at seven sentinel herd sites in the south of Switzerland (canton of Ticino) near the border of Italy, using Onderstepoort-type light traps. This region is botanically and zoologically similar to the Mediterranean and is one of the warmest and most humid areas of the country, hence it is considered a potential access path for BT disease into Switzerland. Collections were made at four cattle farms, two equestrian centres and one goat farm. Sites were sampled four times per month from June to October. Traps were operated from dusk until dawn and samples were collected monthly for analysis through microscopy as well as a Culicoides imicola-specific PCR. Results confirmed the absence of C. imicola (Kieffer) and demonstrated that the potential BT virus vectors are highly abundant, notably: Culicoides obsoletus (Meigen), Culicoides scoticus (Downes & Kettle) and Culicoides dewulfi (Goetghebuer) subgenus Avaritia and Culicoides pulicaris (Linnaeus) subgenus Culicoides. These findings expand the current knowledge of Culicoides population composition in the southern part of the Switzerland. Culicoides cataneii (Clastrier), Culicoides flavipulicaris (Dzhafarov), Culicoides indistinctus (Khalaf), Culicoides nubeculosus (Meigen) and species of the Grisescens complex were reported for the first time in Switzerland. 3aCulicoides 3amidges 3aspecies diversity 3ainsect vectors 3aBluetongue virus 3ainsect surveys 3atrapping 3anew geographic records 3adisease surveillance 3asentinel animals 3acattle 3ahorses 3agoats 2aAnimals 2aBluetonguextransmission 2aBluetongue virus 2aCattle 2aCattle Diseasesxtransmission 2aCeratopogonidaexclassificationxphysiology. 2aDemography 2aInsect Vectorsxclassification 2aSentinel Surveillance 2aTime Factors 3aSwitzerland 0aSwitzerland 0asentinel herds1 aRACLOZ, V.1 aDELÉCOLLE, J.C.1 aKuhn, M.1 aMATHIS, A.1 aGRIOT, C.1 aSTÄRK, K.D.C.1 aVANZETTI, T.0 tMedical and veterinary entomology.g2009 June, v. 23, no. 2 p.93-98dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0269-283X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2915.2009.00803.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090825b20091002c00000000  aINDdNZMe2009/08/25  aNon-US 7aarticle01506naa a2200337 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001800115245010000133300001600233520054000249650002500789650001700814650001800831650002100849650002000870650001600890650001800906650002100924651001600945700001700961773010200978852001301080939003301093945000801126946001301134852000901147655001201156991628139500742620221118014515.0921027e199208  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI920032552DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDouglas, P.D.10aComputerized analysis of selected menu items: A practical tool for the university nutritionists  ap. 992-993.  aNutritionists are in a key position to help college students make wise food choices and have an impact on their lifelong eating habits.

Glutamine is an important nitrogen-carrying amino acid that may be "conditionally essential" in certain disease states to support the gut barrier and immune function and overall protein use. Colonic irrigations with SCFA preparations have demonstrated enhanced healing of bowel tissue in animals and human beings. Dietary fiber supports bacterial SCFA production, normal stool output, and the gut barrier and immune function. However, optimal fiber doses for various medical conditions are not known, and the risk for gastrointestinal (GI) obstruction, diarrhea, gas, and bloating necessitates careful selection of patients and daily monitoring of fiber tolerance. A review of the current literature indicates that widespread use of glutamine and SCFA additives parenterally and enterally awaits further evidence of safety and efficacy in human beings, establishment of appropriate doses, and advances in formulation technology. Administration of dietary fiber to enhance bowel motility should be considered in long-term tube-fed patients with intact GI function and sufficient fluid tolerance to permit hydration of fiber. Industrywide agreement on fiber analysis methods and labeling standards (eg, fiber fermentability vs solubility) would facilitate selection of enteral products. To streamline studies and optimize research efforts in future clinical trials, standard criteria for evaluating GI function, diarrheagenic factors, and intestinal outcome variables should be established. 3aglutamine 3ashort chain fatty acids 3aintestinal absorption 3aimmune response 3adigestive system diseases 3anitrogen 3agastrointestinal motility 3adietary fiber 2aAnimals 2aDietary Fiberxadministration & dosage 2aEnergy Metabolism 2aEnteral Nutrition 2aFatty Acids, Volatilexadministration & dosagexpharmacokinetics. 2aFood, Formulated 2aGlutaminexadministration & dosagexpharmacokinetics. 2aHumans 2aIntestinesximmunologyxphysiology. 2aPectinsxadministration & dosage 2aPolysaccharidesxadministration & dosage 2aSoybeans1 aShronts, E.P.0 tJournal of the American Dietetic Association.g1992 Oct., v. 92, no. 10 p.1239-1246x0002-82237nnas  aDNAL FNC  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aOther US  aDNAL 7aarticle01879naa a2200541 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001600133245005400149300001800203520044600221650001900667650002300686650002400709650002500733650002400758650001400782650001000796650002100806650001000827650000900837650002000846650001700866650001100883650002200894650002400916650001100940650001300951650001600964650002600980650003101006650001901037650001601056700001701072700001901089700002001108700001601128773010501144852001301249939003301262945000801295946001301303852000901316655001201325991628139160742620221118014456.0921028e199210  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI920032672DNAL7 a14016692pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDomel, S.B.12aA pilot weight control program for Hispanic women  ap. 1270-1271.  aObesity is common among the poor and minorities.

These data provide for the first time an estimate of the distribution of usual nutrient intakes in a national probability sample. For several nutrients, 10% to 25% of respondents may habitually consume substantially less than the Recommended Dietary Allowance, despite apparently adequate group means. Hispanics reported higher energy and carbohydrate intakes and a lower percentage of energy from fat than blacks or whites (35.6%, 38.4%, and 38.7% of energy from fat for Hispanics, blacks, and whites, respectively). Whites had lower cholesterol intake than the other two groups, and blacks had a higher intake of sweets. Alcohol intake was lower among women and persons older than 65 years, but no other differences in alcohol intake emerged. Use of adjustment factors improved nutrient intake estimates from this shortened questionnaire to levels similar to those obtained from other national dietary surveys. The nutrient intake data from this research can be used to compare demographic subgroups and to describe the mean and distribution of nutrient intake.

However, a question persists: “which estimate would best account for temperature: the weather station temperature, the average of the vertical profile of air temperature or its 3D distribution within the canopy?” We present experimental results accounting for spatial heterogeneity of air temperature within a maize canopy throughout the crop cycle. Data analysis focused on small-scale variability by studying air temperatures across an inter-row of maize over time at varying heights above the soil. Air temperature was in fact horizontally homogeneous across a maize inter-row at a given height during the growing and senescing period. Thus, measured or simulated vertical profiles adequately reflect the spatial distribution of air temperature within a canopy. These conclusions were fully valid for nighttime periods. For daytime periods, they were valid except at the canopy core height around noon on a few low wind, sunny days. We discuss the few cases of horizontally heterogeneous air temperature as well as the factors that favored them. 3aZea mays 3acanopy 3aplant development 3aspatial distribution 3adevelopmental stages 3aair temperature 3acorn 3aheight 3adiurnal variation 3aspatial variation 3aFrance 0atemporal variation 0ainterrows 0aplant physiology1 aCellier, Pierre0 tAgricultural and forest meteorology.g2009 Aug. 3, v. 149, no. 8 p.1294-1300dElsevier Science Ltd.x0168-19237nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2009.02.0163Available from publisher's Web site  a20090722b20090801c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/06/23  aOther US 7aarticle02772naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004100092040001800133072000900151072000900160100001700169245007100186300001800257500002400275500001500299520146900314650002701783650002201810650001801832650002001850650000901870650001901879650001401898650002901912650002001941651001001961653001001971700001401981700001801995700001802013773011402031852000902145856009102154930003302245945002502278946001102303655001202314IND4421091220221118052214.0090529e20090701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442109122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2009.03.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aJ2001 aGuillén, J.10a²¹⁰Pb and stable lead content in fungi: Its transfer from soil  ap. 4320-4326.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe uptake and transfer of natural radionuclides, other than ⁴⁰K, from soil to mushrooms has been somewhat overlooked in the literature. Their contribution to the dose due to the consumption of mushrooms was considered negligible. But the contribution of ²¹⁰Pb in areas unaffected by any recent radioactive fallout has been found to be significant, up to 35% of the annual dose commitment in Spain. More than 30 species of mushrooms were analyzed, and the ²¹⁰Pb detected was in the range of 0.75-202 Bq/kg d.w. A slight difference was observed between species with different nutritional mechanisms (saprophytes >= mycorrhizae). The ²¹⁰Pb content was correlated with the stable lead content, but not with its predecessor in the uranium radioactive series, ²²⁶Ra. This suggested that ²¹⁰Pb was taken up from the soil by the same pathway as stable lead. The bioavailability of ²¹⁰Pb in soil was determined by means of a sequential extraction procedure (NH₄OAc, 1M HCl, 6M HCl, and residue). About 30% of the ²¹⁰Pb present in the soil was available for transfer to mushrooms, more than other natural radionuclides in the same ecosystem. Lycoperdon perlatum, Hebeloma cylindrosporum, and Amanita curtipes presented the highest values of the available transfer factor, ATF. As reflected in their ATF values, the transfer from soil to mushroom of some natural and anthropogenic radionuclides was in the following order: [graphic removed] 3achemical concentration 3auptake mechanisms 3aradionuclides 3abioavailability 3alead 3asoil chemistry 3amushrooms 3asoil transport processes 3astable isotopes 3aSpain 0afungi1 aBaeza, A.1 aOntalba, M.A.1 aMíguez, M.P.0 tScience of the total environment.g2009 July 1, v. 407, no. 14 p.4320-4326dElsevier Sciencex0048-96977nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2009.03.0253Available from publisher's Web site  a20100127b20100205c00000000  aINDdNZMe2010/01/27  aNon-US 7aarticle03321naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004300111040001800154072000900172100001800181245011100199300001600310500002400326520128500350650002601635650002001661650002101681650002301702650002801725650001601753650001501769650001801784650002101802650001401823650001201837650001101849650002801860650006801888650007501956650003302031650002702064650006602091650001102157650001202168650003202180650002302212650003002235650002002265650001702285651001402302651002902316653003902345700001602384773012402400852000902524856009302533930003302626945002502659946001102684655001202695IND4421092820221118052203.0090529e20090630xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442109282DNAL7 a194469042pmid7 a10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2009.04.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ2021 aSignorini, M.10aQuantitative risk assessment for verocytotoxigenic Escherichia coli in ground beef hamburgers in Argentina  ap. 153-161.  aIncludes references  aA quantitative risk assessment was developed for verocytotoxigenic Escherichia coli (E. coli VTEC) following hamburger consumption. The assessment considers initial contamination levels, cross-contamination and decontamination events during the cattle slaughter process and the distribution, storage and consumption patterns in Argentina and in similar countries in Latin-American. The model predicted an infection risk of 8.12x10⁻⁷, a probability of Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS) of 4.6x10⁻⁸ and a probability of mortality of 5.9x10⁻⁹ per meal for adults. For children, the estimates per meal were 3.23x10⁻⁷, 1.8x10⁻⁸ and 6.31x10⁻¹⁰ for infection, HUS and mortality, respectively. The risk of infection and HUS, were sensitive to the type of storage at home (r =-0.416), slaughterhouse storage temperature (r =0.240) and bacterial concentration in the cattle hide (r =0.239). There was an association between home preparation of hamburgers (r =-0.116) and the risk of illness, although this was a result of the type of storage at retail (r =-0.110) and at home and not their intrinsic characteristics. The most sensitive stages of the process were identified through the risk assessment and these can be used as a basis for measures of risk management. 3aquantitative analysis 3arisk assessment 3aEscherichia coli 3afood contamination 3abacterial contamination 3aground beef 3ahamburgers 3afood analysis 3ameat composition 2aAbattoirs 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aConsumer Product Safety 2aEscherichia coli Infectionsxepidemiologyxetiologyxmortality. 2aEscherichia coli O157xgrowth & developmentxisolation & purification. 2aFood Contaminationxanalysis 2aFood Handlingxmethods 2aHemolytic-Uremic Syndromexepidemiologyxetiologyxmortality. 2aHumans 2aHygiene 2aMeat Productsxmicrobiology 2aModels, Biological 2aPredictive Value of Tests 2aRisk Assessment 2aRisk Factors 3aArgentina 0aArgentinaxepidemiology. 0averocytotoxigenic Escherichia coli1 aTarabla, H.0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2009 June 30, v. 132, no. 2-3 p.153-161dElsevier Sciencex0168-16057nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2009.04.0223Available from publisher's Web site  a20091010b20091106c00000000  aINDd3CTe2009/09/22  aNon-US 7aarticle02838naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150072000900159072000900168100001600177245007500193300001600268500002400284520152200308650002201830650001001852650002801862650002501890650002301915650002301938650001201961653002601973700002001999700002002019700001502039700002202054700001702076700001602093773010302109852000902212856009002221930003302311945002502344946001102369655001202380IND4421095520221118052539.0090529e200908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442109552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.plantsci.2009.04.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF200 0aF600 0aF4001 aKumar, Ajay10aQTL analysis for grain colour and pre-harvest sprouting in bread wheat  ap. 114-122.  aIncludes references  aA major objective in wheat breeding is the development of pre-harvest sprouting (PHS) tolerant wheat varieties with amber grain colour (GC), the latter being preferred both by the consumer in Asian markets, and by the processing industry globally. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) for these two traits were identified using a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population derived from an intervarietal cross, PH132 (red grain and PHS tolerant)xWL711 (amber grain and PHS susceptible). As many as 12 QTL for GC and 11 QTL for PHS were identified; 4 QTL for the two traits were co-localized. Most of the phenotypic variation (PV) for the two traits was explained by the main-effect QTL (M-QTL) having no interaction with environment, suggesting that selection may prove effective for improvement of both the traits. A major QTL for GC (PVE up to 40.42%), coincident with a minor QTL for PHS (PVE up to 8.10%), on the distal region of 3BL and a novel and major GC independent PHS QTL (PVE up to 29.47%) in proximal region of 6AL may prove useful for breeding PHS tolerant amber-grained wheat genotypes. Comparative genomic analysis revealed that the wheat genomic region carrying the major QTL for GC on 3BL is orthologous to a 1.63Mb segment on rice chromosome 1, and the genomic region carrying the major QTL for PHS on 6AL is orthologous to a 5.47Mb segment on rice chromosome 2. These rice genomic sequences may be exploited for fine mapping leading to map-based cloning of the above two major QTL, one each for GC and PHST. 3aTriticum aestivum 3awheat 3aquantitative trait loci 3aphenotypic variation 3alinkage (genetics) 3achromosome mapping 3aalleles 0apre-harvest sprouting1 aKumar, Jitendra1 aSingh, Ravinder1 aGarg, Tosh1 aChhuneja, Parveen1 aBalyan, H.S.1 aGupta, P.K.0 tPlant science.g2009 Aug., v. 177, no. 2 p.114-122dElsevier Science Ireland Ltd.x0168-94527nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plantsci.2009.04.0043Available from publisher's Web site  a20090707b00000000c00000000  aINDdRSCe2009/07/07  aNon-US 7aarticle03343naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150100002100159245008300180300001500263500002400278500001500302520145200317650002501769650002201794650001801816650002001834650002501854650001401879650001901893650001901912650002101931650003701952650002001989650002202009650002102031650002202052650001502074650002002089650002202109650002202131653002202153653001502175653001502190653002902205653002502234653002402259653002002283700002002303700001602323700002102339700002102360700002102381700002102402773010202423852000902525856009002534930003302624945002502657946001102682655001202693IND4421096120221118052502.0090529e200908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442109612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.plantsci.2009.04.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF6001 aSchlangen, Karin10aChalcone 3-hydroxylation is not a general property of flavonoid 3'-hydroxylase  ap. 97-102.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aIn contrast to the well-studied B-ring hydroxylation of several flavonoid classes, knowledge on the establishment of the B-ring hydroxylation pattern in chalcones is still limited. Previous studies using enzyme preparations from Dahlia variabilis petals showed that a NADPH-dependent, membrane bound enzyme is responsible, but the possible involvement of the common flavonoid 3'-hydroxylase (F3'H) remained unclear. Therefore, we tested for the first time recombinant F3'Hs from eleven ornamental plant species, mostly Asteraceae, for their acceptance of chalcones as substrates. Ten of the 11 enzymes tested were not able to hydroxylate the 6'-deoxychalcone isoliquiritigenin at position 3, indicating the involvement of a specific enzyme in the hydroxylation of chalcones in ring B. Recombinant F3'H from Tagetes erecta accepted isoliquiritigenin as a substrate but low conversion rates and kinetic data clearly indicate that flavonoids are the preferred substrates. As microsomal preparations from Tagetes erecta petals do not hydroxylate chalcones at position 3, the observed low chalcone 3-hydroxylase activity of recombinant Tagetes F3'H seems to be a result of the use of a heterologous overexpression system. Cytochrome P450 reductase-specific antibodies provided final evidence that the CH3H reaction is catalyzed by a cytochrome-P450-dependent monooxygenase. This supports future cloning strategies based on respective conserved regions. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aornamental plants 3ahydroxylation 3aRudbeckia hirta 3arecombinant proteins 3achalcones 3aDahlia pinnata 3aTagetes erecta 3acytochrome P-450 3astructure-activity relationships 3aenzyme kinetics 3aenzyme substrates 3aCentaurea cyanus 3aCosmos sulphureus 3aoxygenases 3aenzyme activity 3aCichorium intybus 3aAntirrhinum majus 0aisoliquiritigenin 0aflavonoids 0aAsteraceae 0aflavonoid 3'-hydroxylase 0aOsteospermum hybrida 0aEchinops bannaticus 0aGerbera hybrida1 aMiosic, Silvija1 aTopuz, Fuat1 aMuster, Gerlinde1 aMarosits, Thomas1 aSeitz, Christian1 aHalbwirth, Heidi0 tPlant science.g2009 Aug., v. 177, no. 2 p.97-102dElsevier Science Ireland Ltd.x0168-94527nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plantsci.2009.04.0023Available from publisher's Web site  a20090707b00000000c00000000  aINDdRSCe2009/07/07  aNon-US 7aarticle03617naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150072000900159100002200168245012100190300001600311500002400327500001500351520187800366650001802244650001202262650001802274650001702292650001402309650002102323650002502344650003102369650001702400650004902417650001802466650002002484650001502504650001702519650001302536650002202549650001902571650001902590653001502609653000902624653002502633653002902658653002102687700002002708700001802728773011302746852000902859856009002868930003302958945002502991946001103016655001203027IND4421096820221118052434.0090529e200909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442109682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2008.09.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ101 0aQ5011 aKim, Esther H.-J.10aSurface composition of industrial spray-dried milk powders. 1. Development of surface composition during manufacture  ap. 163-168.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aDevelopment of the surface composition of milk powders during manufacture was investigated in three industrial spray-dried milk powders (skim milk powder, whole milk powder and instant whole milk powder). Samples were obtained from commercial production plants and were collected at different manufacturing stages. As the powder properties of milk powder are defined in spray-drying and the subsequent manufacturing processes, the powder samples were collected at the exit of the spray drying chamber and the exit(s) of the fluidized bed(s), and the surface compositions of the powder samples collected were studied using electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis (ESCA). For all three industrial spray-dried milk powders, no significant differences in surface composition were observed between the samples collected at different manufacturing stages, except for a slight increase (3%) in the surface fat coverage for whole milk powder after the fluidized bed drying process. These results indicate that the surface composition of milk powders is determined to a large extent during the spray drying process and that the subsequent fluidized bed drying and handling processes have no or little effect on the surface composition of milk powders, even though these processes affect the final powder quality (e.g. moisture content, particle size). For whole milk powder and instant whole milk powder, no fat appeared to leak out on to the powder surface during the fluidized bed drying process; however, the fat present on the powder surface after the spray-drying process appeared to flow over the particle surfaces, resulting in a slight increase in the surface fat coverage. After lecithin treatment (instantization), because a mixture of lecithin and anhydrous milk fat was sprayed on the powder, a slight increase in the thickness of the surface fat layer was observed. 3amilk analysis 3alactose 3afood surfaces 3aspray drying 3askim milk 3afree fatty acids 3aphosphatidylcholines 3aparticle size distribution 3amilk quality 3aelectron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy 3awater content 3adried skim milk 3awhole milk 3afat globules 3amilk fat 3aprocessing stages 3awater activity 3afluidized beds 0adried milk 0aESCA 0afluidized bed drying 0amilk surface composition 0amilk composition1 aChen, Xiao Dong1 aPearce, David0 tJournal of food engineering.g2009 Sept., v. 94, no. 2 p.163-168dElsevier Science Pub.

It was recently demonstrated that this is applicable for 'rubbery' particle-wall contacts at relatively low wall temperatures. In this work, experimental investigation was carried out at quasi-steady and relatively elevated wall temperatures to better represent industrial operation of such dryers. Deposition fluxes were collected using Teflon and stainless steel plates. Results indicated that lower wall surface energy does reduce the deposition of amorphous particles, further illustrating the applicability of this approach in industrial condition. This advantage is even more pronounced for deposition of droplets. Utilizing an air operated tester, it was found that wall surface energy only affects the tendency for deposits to detach within certain operation 'window' limits. Such analysis will be critical in evaluating the application of having a less 'sticky' wall. 3awater content 3apowdered foods 3aspray drying 3adryers 3astainless steel 3asurface active properties 3asurface temperature 3asurface tension 3aenergy 3asucrose 3amaltodextrins 3aaqueous solutions 3aglass transition 3aglass transition temperature 3awater activity 3athermodynamics 3aparticles 3aprocess control 0awall surface energy 0aamorphous particles 0adeposition1 aDaud, W.R.W.1 aTasirin, S.M.1 aTalib, M.Z.M.0 tJournal of food engineering.g2009 Sept., v. 94, no. 2 p.192-198dElsevier Science Pub.

The nitrate cycle of the alluvial aquifer of the Plain has been summarized in a seasonal-dependent conceptual model, where the shallow alluvial aquifer plays a fundamental role contributing to contamination of irrigation channels during periods of no manure application. Based on isotopic fingerprinting, chemical characterization and agricultural practices, the main nitrate source involved in the nitrate cycle in the study area is manure that is applied during the fall and winter periods. A nitrogen contribution from the deep alluvial-lacustrine aquifer was also documented in this study. The isotope data also showed the occurrence of denitrification occurring in nitrate pools in the shallow aquifer, which is characterized by low-permeability layers. The nitrate pool in the shallow aquifer is related to infiltration after the application of manure. The isotope and concentration data showed that the increase of nitrate in the irrigation channels under non-runoff conditions is controlled by seepage from the shallow aquifer. The cycle ends with a new application of manure, generating considerable increases of “fresh” nitrate concentration in the channels. The historical trend of decreasing water table conditions and increasing nitrate content in the shallow aquifer threatens the deep aquifer, used for drinking purposes, since heavy pumping can induce the transport of nitrate from the shallow aquifer toward the capture zone of the deep wells. 3aagricultural watersheds 3anitrate nitrogen 3abiogeochemistry 3anitrogen 3aaquifers 3agroundwater 3asurface water 3ainfiltration (hydrology) 3asoil amendments 3aanimal manures 3agroundwater contamination 3adenitrification 3airrigation water 3aseepage 3aItaly1 aFracchiolla, Domenico1 aAravena, Ramon1 aBarbieri, Maurizio0 tJournal of hydrology.g2009 June 15, v. 372, no. 1-4 p.124-135dElsevierx0022-16947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2009.04.0093Available from publisher's Web site  a20090611b20090703c00000000  aINDdRHFe2009/06/11  aNon-US 7aarticle04906naa a2200757 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003600133040001800169072000900187100002800196245010100224300001800325500002400343506007600367520251000443506003702953650002302990650001403013650001903027650001603046650002003062650002503082650002503107650003403132650002003166650000803186650002603194650002303220650003603243650002303279650001603302650001903318650002303337650001003360650001603370650002003386650001903406650002803425650002003453650002303473650001103496650001103507650001803518650004903536650002603585650001103611650006803622650002203690650001603712651001803728700002703746700002103773700001603794700002403810773013603834852000903970856008603979930003304065945002504098946001304123655001204136IND4421082020221207135959.0090529e200906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442108202DNAL7 a194651822pmid7 aPMC40988302pmcid7 a10.1016/j.jada.2009.03.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT0001 aRifas-Shiman, Sheryl L.10aDietary Quality during Pregnancy Varies by Maternal Characteristics in Project Viva: A US Cohort  ap. 1004-1011.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBackground: Maternal diet may influence outcomes of pregnancy and childhood, but data on correlates of food and nutrient intake during pregnancy are scarce. Objective: To examine relationships between maternal characteristics and diet quality during the first trimester of pregnancy. Secondarily we examined associations of diet quality with pregnancy outcomes. Methods: As part of the ongoing US prospective cohort study Project Viva, we studied 1,777 women who completed a food frequency questionnaire during the first trimester of pregnancy. We used linear regression models to examine the relationships of maternal age, prepregnancy body mass index, parity, education, and race/ethnicity with dietary intake during pregnancy. We used the Alternate Healthy Eating Index, slightly modified for pregnancy (AHEI-P), to measure diet quality on a 90-point scale with each of the following nine components contributing 10 possible points: vegetables, fruit, ratio of white to red meat, fiber, trans fat, ratio of polyunsaturated to saturated fatty acids, and folate, calcium, and iron from foods. Results: Mean AHEI-P score was 61±10 (minimum 33, maximum 89). After adjusting for all characteristics simultaneously, participants who were older (1.3 points per 5 years, 95% confidence interval [CI] [0.7 to 1.8]) had better AHEI-P scores. Participants who had higher body mass index (-0.9 points per 5 kg/m², 95% CI [-1.3 to -0.4]), were less educated (-5.2 points for high school or less vs college graduate, 95% CI [-7.0 to -3.5]), and had more children (-1.5 points per child, 95% CI [-2.2 to -0.8]) had worse AHEI-P scores, but African-American and white participants had similar AHEI-P scores (1.3 points for African American vs white, 95% CI [-0.2 to 2.8]). Using multivariate adjusted models, each five points of first trimester AHEI-P was associated lower screening blood glucose level (β -.64 [95% CI -0.02 to -1.25]). In addition, each five points of second trimester AHEI-P was associated with a slightly lower risk of developing preeclampsia (odds ratio 0.87 [95% CI 0.76 to 1.00]), but we did not observe this association with first trimester AHEI-P (odds ratio 0.96 [95% CI 0.84 to 1.10]). Conclusions: Pregnant women who were younger, less educated, had more children, and who had higher prepregnancy body mass index had poorer-quality diets. These results could be used to tailor nutrition education messages to pregnant women to avoid long-term sequelae from suboptimal maternal nutrition.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3amaternal nutrition 3apregnancy 3apregnant women 3afood intake 3anutrient intake 3anutrition assessment 3anutritional adequacy 3afood frequency questionnaires 3abody mass index 3aage 3aparity (reproduction) 3aeducational status 3anationalities and ethnic groups 3aDietary Guidelines 3afood groups 3acohort studies 3anutritional status 2aAdult 2aAge Factors 2aBody Mass Index 2aCohort Studies 2aCross-Sectional Studies 2aDietxstandards 2aEducational Status 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aLinear Models 2aMaternal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aMultivariate Analysis 2aParity 2aPregnancyxphysiologyxpsychologyxstatistics & numerical data. 2aPregnancy Outcome 2aYoung Adult 0aUnited States1 aRich-Edwards, Janet W.1 aKleinman, Ken P.1 aOken, Emily1 aGillman, Matthew W.0 tJournal of the American Dietetic Association.g2009 June, v. 109, no. 6 p.1004-1011dAmerican Dietetic Associationx0002-82237nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jada.2009.03.0013Available from publisher's Web site  a20090629b20090703c00000000  aINDdPNNe2009/06/29  aOther US 7aarticle03356naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100002400149245017000173300001600343500002400359520212900383650002802512650002702540650001202567650001502579650001602594650002002610650001302630650001302643650001902656650002002675650001802695650001402713651001102727651001102738651001802749700002402767773009402791852000902885856005202894655001202946IND4440578920221118052328.0100730e20100811xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444057892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2010.05.0452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRanalli, Anthony J.14aThe importance of the riparian zone and in-stream processes in nitrate attenuation in undisturbed and agricultural watersheds - A review of the scientific literature  ap. 406-415.  aIncludes references  aWe reviewed published studies from primarily glaciated regions in the United States, Canada, and Europe of the (1) transport of nitrate from terrestrial ecosystems to aquatic ecosystems, (2) attenuation of nitrate in the riparian zone of undisturbed and agricultural watersheds, (3) processes contributing to nitrate attenuation in riparian zones, (4) variation in the attenuation of nitrate in the riparian zone, and (5) importance of in-stream and hyporheic processes for nitrate attenuation in the stream channel. Our objectives were to synthesize the results of these studies and suggest methodologies to (1) monitor regional trends in nitrate concentration in undisturbed 1st order watersheds and (2) reduce nitrate loads in streams draining agricultural watersheds. Our review reveals that undisturbed headwater watersheds have been shown to be very retentive of nitrogen, but the importance of biogeochemical and hydrological riparian zone processes in retaining nitrogen in these watersheds has not been demonstrated as it has for agricultural watersheds. An understanding of the role of the riparian zone in nitrate attenuation in undisturbed watersheds is crucial because these watersheds are increasingly subject to stressors, such as changes in land use and climate, wildfire, and increases in atmospheric nitrogen deposition. In general, understanding processes controlling the concentration and flux of nitrate is critical to identifying and mapping the vulnerability of watersheds to water quality changes due to a variety of stressors. In undisturbed and agricultural watersheds we propose that understanding the importance of riparian zone processes in 2nd order and larger watersheds is critical. Research is needed that addresses the relative importance of how the following sources of nitrate along any given stream reach might change as watersheds increase in size and with flow: (1) inputs upstream from the reach, (2) tributary inflow, (3) water derived from the riparian zone, (4) groundwater from outside the riparian zone (intermediate or regional sources), and (5) in-stream (hyporheic) processes. 3aagricultural watersheds 3aatmospheric deposition 3aclimate 3aecosystems 3agroundwater 3aland use change 3anitrates 3anitrogen 3ariparian areas 3astream channels 3awater quality 3awildfires 3aCanada 3aEurope 3aUnited States1 aMacalady, Donald L.0 tJournal of hydrology.g2010 Aug. 11, v. 389, no. 3-4 p.406-415dElsevierx0022-16947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2010.05.045 7aarticle03631naa a2200769 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001700164245011300181300001600294500002400310520137200334650001701706650001601723650002301739650001101762650000901773650002701782650002201809650001201831650001401843650003001857650002001887650000901907650002201916650001601938650001701954650002801971650002801999650003302027650002702060650001902087650001702106650002002123650002002143650003802163650002902201650005702230650002302287650003702310650001402347650001902361650003202380650005602412650001602468653001202484653002602496653002202522653001202544653001702556653002702573653002102600700001502621700001702636700001502653700001202668700001302680700001702693773008202710852000902792856004802801655001202849IND4393035020221118052339.0070715e200708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439303502DNAL7 a175416322pmid7 a10.1007/s00425-007-0525-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Wenzhen10aIdentification and fine mapping of a thermo-sensitive chlorophyll deficient mutant in rice (Oryza sativa L.)  ap. 785-795.  aIncludes references  aA thermo-sensitive chlorophyll deficient mutant was isolated from more than 15,000 transgenic rice lines. The mutant displayed normal phenotype at 23°C or lower temperature (permissive temperature). However, when grown at 26°C or higher (nonpermissive temperature) the plant exhibited an abnormal phenotype characterized by yellow green leaves. Genetic analysis revealed that a single nuclear-encoded recessive gene is responsible for the mutation, which is tentatively designed as cde1(t) (chlorophyll deficient 1, temporally). PCR analysis and hygromycin resistance assay indicated the mutation was not caused by T-DNA insertion. To isolate the cde1(t) gene, a map-based cloning strategy was employed and 15 new markers (five SSR and ten InDels markers) were developed. A high-resolution physical map of the chromosomal region around the cde1(t) gene was made using F₂ and F₃ population consisting of 1,858 mutant individuals. Finally, the cde1(t) gene was mapped in 7.5 kb region between marker ID10 and marker ID11 on chromosome 2. Sequence analysis revealed only one candidate gene, OsGluRS, in the 7.5 kb region. Cloning and sequencing of the target region from the cde1(t) mutant showed that a missense mutation occurred in the mutant. So the OsGluRS gene (TIGR locus Os02 g02860) which encode glutamyl-tRNA synthetase was identified as the Cde1(t) gene. 3aOryza sativa 3achlorophyll 3achromosome mapping 3aleaves 3aloci 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amissense mutation 3amutants 3aphenotype 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arecessive genes 3arice 3asequence analysis 3atemperature 3atransfer DNA 2aCarotenoidsxmetabolism 2aChlorophyllxdeficiency 2aChloroplastsxultrastructure 2aChromosome Segregation 2aDNA, Bacterial 2aGenes, Plant 2aGenetic Linkage 2aGenetic Markers 2aGlutamate-tRNA Ligasexmetabolism 2aMutagenesis, Insertional 2aMutant Proteinsxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aMutationxgenetics 2aOryzaxgeneticsxultrastructure. 2aPhenotype 2aPhotosynthesis 2aPhysical Chromosome Mapping 2aPlant Proteinsxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aTemperature 0acde1(t) 0aChlorophyll deficient 0aMap-based cloning 0aOsGluRS 0aPhysical map 0aRice (Oryza sativa L.) 0aThermo-sensitive1 aFu, Yaping1 aHu, Guocheng1 aSi, Huamin1 aZhu, Li1 aWu, Chao1 aSun, Zongxiu0 tPlanta.g2007 Aug., v. 226, no. 3 p.785-795dSpringer-Verlagx0032-09357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00425-007-0525-z 7aarticle02814naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002600111040001800137100001600155245011800171300001800289500002400307520133100331650002701662650002001689650001301709650001801722650000901740650001301749650001601762650001201778650002801790650003101818650000901849650004101858650000901899650002301908650002701931650002401958650004001982650002602022650002602048700002102074700001802095700002202113700001802135773010702153852000902260856003902269655001202308IND4443258920221118052229.0101001e201010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444325892DNAL7 a208787012pmid7 a10.1002/ptr.31422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMissima, F.14aThe Effect of propolis on Th1/Th2 cytokine expression and production by melanoma-bearing mice submitted to stress  ap. 1501-1507.  aIncludes references  aSince propolis possesses immunomodulatory and antitumoral activities, this work aimed to evaluate its effect on Th1 (IL-2 and IFN-γ) and Th2 (IL-4 and IL-10) cytokines mRNA expression and production by melanoma-bearing mice submitted to immobilization stress. C57BL/6 male mice were inoculated with B16F10 cells, treated with propolis and submitted to stress for 14 days. Spleen cells were assessed for Th1/Th2 cytokine expression and production. Stress induced a higher tumor area, while propolis-treated mice, stressed or not, showed a melanoma development similar to the control. In groups without melanoma, stress or propolis treatment did not affect IL-2, IL-4 and IL-10 gene expression. On the other hand, IL-2 and IL-10 expression was inhibited in melanoma-bearing mice, stressed or not. Th1 cytokine production was also inhibited in melanoma-bearing mice. Propolis administration to melanoma-bearing mice submitted to stress stimulated IL-2 expression, as well as Th1 cytokine (IL-2 and IFN-γ) production, indicating the activation of antitumor cell-mediated immunity. Propolis also stimulated IL-10 expression and production, which may be related to immunoregulatory effects. The data indicate that propolis exerted an immunomodulatory activity in this assay, which may be related to its antitumoral action in vivo. 3acell-mediated immunity 3agene expression 3amelanoma 3amessenger RNA 3amice 3apropolis 3asplenocytes 2aAnimals 2aCytokinesxbiosynthesis 2aGene Expression Regulation 2aMale 2aMelanoma, Experimentalxdrug therapy 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred C57BL 2aPropolisxpharmacology 2aRestraint, Physical 2aStress, Physiologicalxdrug effects 2aTh1 Cellsximmunology 2aTh2 Cellsximmunology1 aPagliarone, A.C.1 aOrsatti, C.L.1 aAraújo, J.P.

In this study, we investigated the role of free IAA in pollen-pistil interactions during pollen germination and tube growth in Nicotiana tabacum L. through using histo and subcellular immunolocalization with auxin monoclonal antibodies, quantification by HPLC and ELISA together with GUS staining in DR5::GUS-transformed plants. The results showed that free IAA in unpollinated styles was higher in the apical part and basal part than in the middle part, and it was more abundant in the transmitting tissue (TT). At the stage of pollen germination, IAA reached its highest content in the stigma and was mainly distributed in TT. After the pollen tubes entered the styles, the signal increased in the part where pollen tubes would enter and then rapidly declined in the part where pollen tubes had penetrated. Subcellular localization confirmed the presence of IAA in TT cells of stigmas and styles. Accordingly, a schematic diagram summarizes the changing pattern of free IAA level during flowering, pollination and pollen tube growth. Furthermore, we presented evidence that low concentration of exogenous IAA could, to a certain extent, facilitate in vitro pollen tube growth. These results suggest that IAA may be directly or indirectly involved in the pollen-pistil interactions. Additionally, some improvements of the IAA immunolocalization technique were made. 3aNicotiana tabacum 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aflowering 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aindole acetic acid 3amonoclonal antibodies 3apollen tubes 3apollination 3astigma 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquid 2aEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay 2aFlowersxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aIndoleacetic Acidsxmetabolism 2aPollenxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aPollen Tubexgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aTobaccoxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism.1 aZhao, Jie0 tPhysiologia plantarum.g2008 Sept., v. 134, no. 1 p.202-215dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0031-93177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1399-3054.2008.01125.x 7aarticle02553naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245011900163300001800282500002400300520130600324650002001630650001201650650001201662650001601674650001601690650001801706650001301724650001601737650001101753650001101764650001701775650001401792650001201806650001301818650001601831650002001847650002001867650001201887700001901899700001601918773010401934852000902038856004802047655001202095IND4443993720221118052226.0101022e201011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444399372DNAL7 a10.1007/s11738-010-0496-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRai, Manoj K.10aRegeneration of plantlets of guava (Psidium guajava L.) from somatic embryos developed under salt-stress condition  ap. 1055-1062.  aIncludes references  aThe present study demonstrates the regeneration of plantlets of guava (Psidium guajava L.) from somatic embryos developed under salt-stress conditions. With increasing concentrations of NaCl in induction medium (MS + 4.52 μM 2,4-d + 5% sucrose) from 0 to 200 mM, the number of somatic embryos per responsive explant decreased. Somatic embryos induced on 0-100 mM NaCl containing medium developed into torpedo stages, whereas, the development of somatic embryos that differentiated on 150 and 200 mM NaCl-supplemented medium was arrested prior to torpedo stage and did not undergo maturation phase. Somatic embryos that developed on NaCl-containing medium, showed better germination in the presence of NaCl as compared with those developed on medium without NaCl. The effect of increasing salt-stress was also investigated on plant growth, chlorophyll and carotenoids, Na⁺ and K⁺, and proline and glycine betaine accumulation in in vitro grown plantlets. The level of Na⁺ in leaves increased with increasing concentrations of NaCl in the medium. Accumulation of free proline and glycine betaine in leaves significantly increased with increasing salinity. The results suggest that accumulation of proline and glycine betaine may be important for osmotic adjustment in guava under salinity stress. 3aPsidium guajava 3aTorpedo 3abetaine 3acarotenoids 3achlorophyll 3aembryogenesis 3aexplants 3agermination 3aguavas 3aleaves 3aplant growth 3aplantlets 3aproline 3asalinity 3asalt stress 3asodium chloride 3asomatic embryos 3asucrose1 aJaiswal, V.

On Ute Mountain, the USDA will be delivering 35,000 lbs. of commodities monthly to be distributed to eligible households; the distribution plan is thought to be more advantageous than food stamps because regular supermarkets are distant and few Utes have transportation. The White Earth and Leech Lake Reservations also found food stamp participation to be low--again due to transportation problems but also to the discomfort of working with "outsiders". These two reservations find food distribution programs more equitable, with each qualifying 4-person household getting about 280 lbs. monthly. An Indian nutritionist reports that the distribution programs are useful tools to supplement and add variety to their diets but that nutrition education is still necessary. 3aAmerican Indians 3afood distribution programs 3alow income households 0aprogram effectiveness 0aCultural factors 0aFood stamp programs 0aProgram design1 aLancaster, David.0 tFood & nutrition.g1980 Aug., v. 10, no. 4 p.4-117nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19801002c00000000  aFNC  aUSDA 7aarticle01832naa a2200277 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100002600115245004100141300001200182520107600194650004601270650003001316650002401346653001901370653002201389773005901411852001301470930003301483945000801516946000901524852000901533655001201542991628124410742620221118052231.0850808e198410  xx ||||go|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI850076542DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVachon, Jane Mattern.10aBuilding a better food stamp program  ap. 2-6.  aThrough a nationwide campaign called Operation Awareness, USDA has been encouraging states to share expertise, ideas, and effective management strategies at regional and national conferences. Improvements have been noted in error rate, Food Stamp losses with reductions in fraud, and errors made by case workers. Awards and citations have provided incentives for states to improve programs. A Catalogue of Program Improvement Activities is a reference guide for local program managers which explains and describes successful management techniques. The computer has been utilized for claims tracking, interviewing, and crosschecking items such as unreported assets in bank accounts, jail matches to prevent incarcerated persons from receiving food stamps, interstate matches to prevent a person from filing a claim in more than one place, and "drug matches" where a drug arrest finds people with large sums of money. Many success stories are used to illustrate program effectiveness. Operation Awareness is helping to restore the integrity of the Food Stamp Program.

Institutions apply for alternate approval from the administering state agency when they are unable to receive state or local licensing. Because day care homes have to be sponsored by a qualifying organization (such as a church), the rules encourage more sponsorships in order to expand the CCFP service. There are separate fixed rates of reimbusement for administrative costs and food service payments. Centers with high enrollments of low income children can receive more funds and reduce their record keeping. In 1980, 18,000 child care centers and 11,500 day care homes were participating in CCFP, but the new rules may boost these figures substantially.

We estimated how drifting plankton from a reservoir contribute to downstream food webs and showed that they alter community structures over a 10-km reach below the dam. To estimate the contribution of the drifting plankton to macroinvertebrates, we used C and N isotopes and an IsoSource mixing model. In spring and autumn, contributions of plankton to collector-filterer species were highest 0.2 km downstream of the dam, and clearly decreased from 0.2 to 10 km. At 0.2 km, the contribution of plankton to a predator stonefly was remarkably high. These results indicated that drifting plankton from a dam reservoir could subsidize downstream food webs and alter their energy base, but the importance of this subsidy decreased as distance from the reservoir increased. The general linear models indicated that the abundance of collector-filterers and predators was related positively to zooplankton density in stream water. Thus, food source alteration by drifting plankton also influenced the community structures downstream of the dam. 3aautumn 3acommunity structure 3aecosystems 3aenergy 3afood webs 3afoods 3aisotopes 3alinear models 3amacroinvertebrates 3apredators 3aspring 3astreams 3asubsidies 3azooplankton 2aAnimals 2aCarbon Isotopesxanalysis 2aEcosystem 2aFood Chain 2aInvertebratesxchemistryxphysiology. 2aModels, Biological 2aNitrogen Isotopesxanalysis 2aPlanktonxchemistryxphysiology. 2aPopulation Density 2aRivers 2aSeasons 0aJapan1 aChang, Kwang-Hyeon1 aAndo, Takamitsu1 aImai, Hiroyuki1 aNakano, Shin-ichi1 aKajimoto, Akio1 aKatano, Izumi0 tOecologia.g2008 May, v. 156, no. 2 p.363-371dSpringer-Verlagx0029-85497nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-008-0988-z 7aarticle01569naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245006200126300001600188500002400204520063600228650003900864650001900903650001400922650002200936650001000958650002100968650001200989650001101001650002201012650001401034650002801048650001601076700001301092773010501105852000901210655001201219IND2061766020221118052343.0980210e199406  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206176602DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYunlong, C.10aSustainability in Chinese agriculture: challenge and hope  ap. 279-288.  aIncludes references  aBased upon a framework of three (i.e. biophysical, sociopolitical and techno-economic) dimensions of sustainability in agriculture, this paper discusses the current situation of Chinese agriculture in relation to sustainability.

Ketosis induction, begun at d 15 postpartum, caused ketonemia and gradual development of clinical ketosis by d 40 to 45. None of the cows in the control or glucose-treated groups became ketotic. Concentrations of NEFA in plasma of cows that became ketotic increased 3.0-, 2.6-, and 1.9-fold at 3 wk before, 2 wk before, and at ketosis, respectively, but increased nonsignificantly for glucose-treated cows. Concurrently, beta-hydroxybutyrate increased 3.5-, 5.8- and 8.4-fold for cows that became ketotic but 1.6-fold or less for glucose-treated cows. Plasma acetate increased dramatically 2 wk before ketosis. Liver glycogen content decreased to nearly 0 by 2 wk before ketosis occurred but it increased to prepartal values in glucose-treated cows. Liver triglycerides averaged 2.0% of wet weight at d 5 for all cows but increased to 8 to 10% for about 2 wk before ketosis occurred. Microscopy of liver samples demonstrated progressive accumulation of lipid globules, which began in hepatocytes near the central vein and progressed toward the portal triad. Visible lipid content reached a peak 2 wk before ketosis. Hepatic in vitro gluconeogenic capacity decreased significantly for ketosis induction protocol cows when clinical ketosis was detected. Results indicate that experimental ketosis was preceded by metabolic abnormalities up to 2 wk before clinical ketosis occurred. The key events for onset of clinical ketosis, however, were not elucidated. 3adairy cows 3aketosis 3afatty liver 3arestricted feeding 3ablood glucose 3ametabolites 3ainsulin 3alactation 3amilk yield 3abody weight 3afeed intake 3afatty acids 3ahistology 3aenzyme activity 3aliver 2a3-Hydroxybutyric Acid 2aAcetatesxblood 2aAnimals 2aBlood Glucosexanalysis 2aBody Weight 2aCattle 2aCattle Diseasesxdrug therapyxetiologyxmetabolism. 2aEating 2aFatty Acids, Nonesterifiedxblood 2aFatty Liverxdrug therapyxetiologyxmetabolismxveterinary. 2aFemale 2aGluconeogenesis 2aHydroxybutyratesxblood 2aInsulinxblood 2aKetosisxdrug therapyxetiologyxmetabolismxveterinary. 2aLactation 2aLipidsxanalysis 2aLiverxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aLiver Glycogenxanalysis 2aPostpartum Periodxmetabolism 2aTriglyceridesxanalysis 0adry matter1 aDrackley, J.K.1 aRichard, M.J.1 aSanderson, T.P.1 aMiller, L.D.1 aYoung, J.W.0 tJournal of dairy science.g1991 Dec., v. 74, no. 12 p.4238-4253x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02478naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245009200126300001800218500001500236520138400251650002201635650001601657650002901673650002301702650001601725650002901741650001001770650001201780650002001792653001701812653001601829653001201845700001801857700001601875700001601891700002101907773008501928852000902013939003302022946001302055655001202068IND9203867520221118052250.0920617e199112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920386752DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOberg, C.J.10aEffects of Lactobacillus helveticus culture on physical properties of Mozzarella cheese  ap. 4101-4107.  a2019-12-04  aSix-liter vats of Mozzarella cheese were made using either single strains of Lactobacillus helveticus or paired strains of L. helveticus and Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus. Lactobacillus helveticus strains were either strongly or weakly proteolytic as established by the o-phthaldialdehyde test. Three cheeses were made with each culture type and stored at 4 degrees C. Stretch, melt, color, moisture, and pH values were determined at 1, 7, 14, and 28 d. All cheeses lost stretch rapidly from d 1 to 7 and slowly declined between d 7 and 28. Melt increased rapidly for all cheeses from d 1 to 7 and then remained constant. Differences in stretch and melt from one culture type to another were not significant. Cheese made with proteinase-deficient strains had more stretch after holding for 14 and 28 d than cheese made with nondeficient strains. Time of storage significantly affected both stretch and melt over 28 d. Cheeses made from all four culture types decreased in cook color over 28 d of storage. There were no significant strain differences in cook color, but the culture by time interaction was significant. Cheese made with pairs or single strains of L. helveticus had the same melt, more stretch, and less cook color than cheese made with paired strains of Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and S. salivarius ssp. thermophilus studied previously. 3amozzarella cheese 3aproteinases 3aStreptococcus salivarius 3astrain differences 3aproteolysis 3aLactobacillus helveticus 3acolor 3amelting 3acheese starters 0acheesemaking 0aconsistency 0astretch1 aMerrill, R.K.1 aMoyes, L.V.1 aBrown, R.J.1 aRichardson, G.H.0 tJournal of dairy science.g1991 Dec., v. 74, no. 12 p.4101-4107x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03736naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001900128245011100147300001800258520168000276650001501956650002001971650001801991650002102009650000702030650002502037650001402062650001502076650002302091650001202114650003602126650002702162650003702189650003002226650001102256650003102267650006102298650002202359650003202381650003002413650003002443650006502473650002902538650005602567650004402623650003002667650003102697650006802728650003602796653001802832653001902850700001502869700001502884700001502899700001502914700001702929773008502946852000903031939003303040946001303073655001203086IND9203868220221118052236.0920617e199112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920386822DNAL7 a17871872pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSordillo, L.M.10aPathological changes in bovine mammary glands following intramammary infusion of recombinant interleukin-2  ap. 4164-4174.  aEighteen lactating dairy cows were used to evaluate the physiological response of mammary glands to increasing doses of recombinant bovine interleukin-2. Right front and rear quarters were intramammarily infused with five different doses (.1 to 100 micrograms per quarter) of interleukin-2 as either a single or multiple treatment. Left front and rear quarters were intramammarily infused with a saline placebo and served as within-animal controls. Milk secretion samples for compositional analysis were collected from each quarter prior to infusion and at 12, 24, 36, and 48 h following infusion. Animals were slaughtered by exsanguination immediately following the 48-h sampling period, and mammary gland tissue was obtained for morphometric analysis. No changes in milk composition were observed between control quarters and those infused with up to 10 micrograms of interleukin-2 per quarter, administered as either a single or multiple treatment. Quarters infused with a single 100-microgram dose of interleukin-2 or three consecutive doses of 25 and 100 Kg of interleukin-2 had significantly lower lactose concentrations; there was a concomitant increase in bovine serum albumin, pH, and SCC compared with preinfusion concentrations or with control quarters. Morphometric analysis of tissue demonstrated an increase in stroma, a decrease in lumenal area, and a marked increase in the number of infiltrating leukocytes in those quarters infused with the higher doses of interleukin-2. Results suggest that interleukin-2 can be intramammarily infused at doses as high as 10 micrograms per quarter without adversely affecting milk quality or normal mammary gland function. 3adairy cows 3aimmunopathology 3ainterleukin-2 3amilk composition 3apH 3abovine serum albumin 3ahistology 3aleukocytes 3asomatic cell count 2aAnimals 2aCattleximmunologyxphysiology. 2aCell Countxveterinary 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aEosinophilsxdrug effects 2aFemale 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aInterleukin-2xadministration & dosagexadverse effects. 2aLactosexanalysis 2aLeukocyte Countxveterinary 2aLymphocytesxdrug effects 2aMacrophagesxdrug effects 2aMammary Glands, Animalxdrug effectsxpathologyxphysiology. 2aMast Cellsxdrug effects 2aMastitis, Bovineximmunologyxprevention & control. 2aMilkxanalysisxcytologyxdrug effects. 2aNeutrophilsxdrug effects 2aPlasma Cellsxdrug effects 2aRecombinant Proteinsxadministration & dosagexadverse effects. 2aSerum Albumin, Bovinexanalysis 0acell counting 0amammary tissue1 aSnider, M.1 aHughes, H.1 aAfseth, G.1 aCampos, M.1 aBabiuk, L.A.0 tJournal of dairy science.g1991 Dec., v. 74, no. 12 p.4164-4174x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02265naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001800128245010600146300001800252520123800270650001801508650002001526650002201546650001501568650001501583650001201598650002401610650002501634650002301659650001301682653001301695653002301708700002001731773008501751852000901836939003301845946001301878655001201891IND9203870020221118052233.0920617e199112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920387002DNAL7 a17872022pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoldman, K.G.10aDerivative-free restricted maximum likelihood estimation in animal models with a sparse matrix solver  ap. 4337-4343.  aEstimation of (co)variance components by derivative-free REML requires repeated evaluation of the log-likelihood function of the data. Gaussian elimination of the augmented mixed model coefficient matrix is often used to evaluate the likelihood function, but it can be costly for animal models with large coefficient matrices. This study investigated the use of a direct sparse matrix solver to obtain the log-likelihood function. The sparse matrix package SPARSPAK was used to reorder the mixed model equations once and then repeatedly to solve the equations by Cholesky factorization to generate the terms required to calculate the likelihood. The animal model used for comparison contained 19 fixed levels, 470 maternal permanent environmental effects, and 1586 direct and 1586 maternal genetic effects, resulting in a coefficient matrix of order 3661 with .3% nonzero elements after including numerator relationships. Compared with estimation via Gaussian elimination of the unordered system, utilization of SPARSPAK required 605 and 240 times less central processing unit time on mainframes and personal computers, respectively. The SPARSPAK package also required less memory and provided solutions for all effects in the model. 3aanimal models 3aanimal breeding 3acomputer software 3aalgorithms 2aAlgorithms 2aAnimals 2aComputer Simulation 2aLikelihood Functions 2aModels, Biological 2aSoftware 0amatrices 0amaximum likelihood1 aVan Vleck, L.D.0 tJournal of dairy science.g1991 Dec., v. 74, no. 12 p.4337-4343x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03192naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092024002200123024001900145040001800164100002200182245009600204300001300300500002400313506007600337520171100413506003702124650002502161650002602186650002602212650001202238650001102250650001802261650002002279650001302299700002902312700002402341700002102365700002002386700001902406700002302425700002402448700001602472773011102488852000902599856008102608856003302689655001202722IND4394890720221207144615.0070909e200709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439489072DNAL7 a10.1104/pp.107.1011622doi7 aPMC19765882pmcid7 a176446272pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStrasser, Richard10aEnzymatic Properties and Subcellular Localization of Arabidopsis β-N-Acetylhexosaminidases  ap. 5-16.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPlant glycoproteins contain substantial amounts of paucimannosidic N-glycans lacking terminal GlcNAc residues at their nonreducing ends. It has been proposed that this is due to the action of β-hexosaminidases during late stages of N-glycan processing or in the course of N-glycan turnover. We have now cloned the three putative β-hexosaminidase sequences present in the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) genome. When heterologously expressed as soluble forms in Spodoptera frugiperda cells, the enzymes (termed HEXO1-3) could all hydrolyze the synthetic substrates p-nitrophenyl-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-β-D-glucopyranoside, p-nitrophenyl-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-β-D-galactopyranoside, 4-methylumbelliferyl-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-β-D-glucopyranoside, and 4-methylumbelliferyl-6-sulfo-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-β-D-glucopyranoside, albeit to a varying extent. HEXO1 to HEXO3 were further able to degrade pyridylaminated chitotriose, whereas pyridylaminated chitobiose was only cleaved by HEXO1. With N-glycan substrates, HEXO1 displayed a much higher specific activity than HEXO2 and HEXO3. Nevertheless, all three enzymes were capable of removing terminal GlcNAc residues from the α1,3- and α1,6-mannosyl branches of biantennary N-glycans without any strict branch preference. Subcellular localization studies with HEXO-fluorescent protein fusions transiently expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana plants showed that HEXO1 is a vacuolar protein. In contrast, HEXO2 and HEXO3 are mainly located at the plasma membrane. These results indicate that HEXO1 participates in N-glycan trimming in the vacuole, whereas HEXO2 and/or HEXO3 could be responsible for the processing of N-glycans present on secretory glycoproteins.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aNicotiana benthamiana 3aSpodoptera frugiperda 3aenzymes 3agenome 3aglycoproteins 3aplasma membrane 3avacuoles1 aBondili, Jayakumar Singh1 aSchoberer, Jennifer1 aSvoboda, Barbara1 aLiebminger, Eva1 aGlössl, Josef1 aAltmann, Friedrich1 aSteinkellner, Herta1 aMach, Lukas0 tPlant physiology.g2007 Sept., v. 145, no. 1 p.5-16dAmerican Society of Plant Biologistsx0032-08897nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1104/pp.107.1011623Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.plantphysiol.org/ 7aarticle02792naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002000152245008400172300001600256500002400272520172900296650001402025650001902039650002302058650002502081650002402106650002602130650001202156650000902168650001902177650001802196700001902214700001602233773011702249852000902366856005502375655001202430IND4458452520221118052438.0110527e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445845252DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1477-9552.2011.00297.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUzea, Adrian D.10aActivists and Animal Welfare: Quality Verifications in the Canadian Pork Sector  ap. 281-304.  aIncludes references  aAnimal welfare is an emotive topic. Although most governments legislate against outright animal cruelty, animal welfare organisations have actively lobbied for more stringent farm animal welfare regulations. Food retailers and restaurant chains have faced pressure from animal welfare organisations to implement more stringent animal welfare requirements for their suppliers. Is the demand for more stringent farm animal welfare protocols primarily determined by a subset of consumers with very strong preferences or does it signal a more fundamental underlying change in societal preferences? Given the credence nature of farm animal welfare, whom do consumers trust for credible quality assurances? This article analyses the role of quality verification in a market characterised by consumers with heterogeneous preferences for animal welfare. Of particular interest are the relative strength of preferences for humane animal treatment assurances and the credibility of these quality claims. Using data from a Canadian survey targeted at two distinct samples - a general population group and members of animal welfare organisations - a discrete choice experiment is used to assess consumer attitudes towards animal welfare assurances for pork products. The credibility of quality verification by public sector, private sector and third party agents is assessed. Evidence confirms that consumer preferences for farm animal welfare assurance and the source of verification are indeed heterogeneous. Although a portion of consumers remain largely indifferent to pork products with animal welfare assurances, a group of highly motivated consumers exist with an economic incentive to lobby for tougher animal welfare standards. 3aactivists 3aanimal welfare 3aconsumer attitudes 3aconsumer preferences 3aeconomic incentives 3afarmed animal species 3amarkets 3apork 3aprivate sector 3apublic sector1 aHobbs, Jill E.1 aZhang, Jing0 tJournal of agricultural economics.g2011 June, v. 62, no. 2 p.281-304dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0021-857X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1477-9552.2011.00297.x 7aarticle02861naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001600129245011500145300001600260500002400276520122000300650001501520650001901535650001701554650001901571650002001590650001201610650001401622650000901636650001001645650001001655650002701665650001101692650001701703650002401720650002301744650001601767650000901783650001001792650001501802650001201817650003201829650003101861650004301892650001401935650001101949650006101960650001602021650000902037650002502046700001702071700001502088700001702103700001802120773011202138852000902250655001202259IND4364958520221118052427.0041014e200402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436495852DNAL7 a147476792pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZafar, T.A.10aNondigestible oligosaccharides increase calcium absorption and suppress bone resorption in ovariectomized rats  ap. 399-402.  aIncludes references  aNondigestible oligosaccharides (NDO) including inulin and fructooligosaccharides (FOS) have been reported to stimulate calcium absorption. Here we report the effect of a mixture of inulin and FOS (Raftilose Synergy 1, Orafti) on calcium and bone metabolism in ovariectomized (OVX) rats. OVX rats (6 mo old) were fed a semipurified diet for 3 mo in our animal care laboratory for stabilization after ovariectomy. They were then divided into two groups (n = 13/group) and fed either a control or a NDO-supplemented diet (55 g/kg) for 21 d. Catheters were placed in their jugular veins. After 2 d, a tracer (45Ca) was administered by gavage or i.v. and blood was sampled for up to 300 min. Urine and fecal samples were collected for 4 d after 45Ca administration. Femurs were measured for bone mineral density (BMD), breaking strength, and total calcium. Calcium absorption, femoral calcium content, BMD, and bone balance (V(bal)) were significantly increased (P < 0.05) by NDO, whereas the bone resorption rate relative to the bone formation rate was significantly depressed by NDO. We conclude that feeding NDO at 5.5 g/100 g for 21 d has a positive effect on calcium absorption and retention in ovariectomized rats. 3aabsorption 3ablood sampling 3abone density 3abone formation 3abone resorption 3acalcium 3acatheters 3adiet 3afeces 3afemur 3afructooligosaccharides 3ainulin 3ajugular vein 3alabeling techniques 3alaboratory animals 3aovariectomy 3arats 3aurine 2aAbsorption 2aAnimals 2aBone Resorptionxmetabolism 2aBone and Bonesxmetabolism 2aCalciumxmetabolismxpharmacokinetics. 2aDigestion 2aFemale 2aOligosaccharidesxadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aOvariectomy 2aRats 2aRats, Sprague-Dawley1 aWeaver, C.M.1 aZhao, Y.D.1 aMartin, B.R.1 aWastney, M.E.0 tJournal of nutrition.g2004 Feb., v. 134, no. 2 p.399-402dAmerican Institute of Nutritionx0022-31667nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02293naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001800171245012900189300001600318500002400334500001500358520086100373650001201234650002001246650001001266650000901276650002101285650001601306650003101322650001101353650001201364650004101376650003601417650000901453650004301462650004301505650004201548653001601590700002601606700002201632773011701654852000901771856005501780655001201835IND4402802520100501093940.0080314e200804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440280252DNAL7 a180053702pmid7 a10.1111/j.1439-0264.2007.00808.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aÖzdemİr, V.10aSubgross and Macroscopic Investigation of Blood Vessels Originating from Aortic Arch in the Chinchilla (Chinchilla lanigera)  ap. 131-133.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aA total of 10 adult, healthy, male chinchilla (Chinchilla lanigera) were used to investigate the vessels originating from aortic arch.

The acid hydrolyzed extracts which represented the total starch lipid [TSLI content ranged from 0.1% (potato) to 0.8% (corn). The combined action of CM and PW resulted in almost complete removal of starch lipids (>98.6%) from most of the starches, the exception being wheat, where the solvent extraction efficiency (% TSL) was 96.3%. The free lipids in the CM extracts (% TSL) ranged from 5.0% (corn) to 62% (fababean), whereas the free and bound lipids in the PW extracts ranged (% TSL) from 44.2% (potato) to 94.8% (corn). Neutral lipids (NL) formed the major lipid class in the CM extracts of all starches, while in PW extracts these were NL in corn and cassava, NL and phospholipids (PL) in potato, and PL in wheat, rice and fababean. There was a great variation among the starches with respect to the major components of the lipid classes in both CM and PW extracts. Monoacyl lipids were most abundant in cereal starches (>78% TSL). The fatty acid composition of NL, GL and PL in CM and PW extracts was determined. 3agrain crops 3alegumes 3atubers 3astarch granules 3aphospholipids 3aglycolipids 3atriacylglycerols 0afood composition tables 0aroot crops1 aHoover, R.0 tFood chemistry.g1991, v. 43, no. 1 p.19-27x0308-81467nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aNon-US 7aarticle01590naa a2200325 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100002000115245009200135300001400227520069500241650001000936650001600946650002200962650002000984650002601004650002001030650001801050651001201068653002801080700001801108773006501126852000901191939003301200945000801233946001101241655001201252991628117340742620221118052014.0920521s1991    xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI920016222DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEne-Obong, H.N.10aNigerian soup condiments: traditional processing and potential as dietary fibre sources  ap. 29-34.  aNigerian soups/sauces have watery or thick consistencies depending on their composition.

Patients were clinically evaluated by means of medical history, physical examination, skin testing, and, if necessary, double-blind placebo-controlled food challenges. Psychological instruments included the MMPI, SCL-90, Eating Attitudes-26, Locus of Control, Recent Life Events Questionnaire, and Profile of Moods Test. Patients with confirmed and unconfirmed reactions did not differ in locus of control orientation or in measures of recent life stress. Those with unconfirmed reactions scored higher than did the confirmed group for hypochondriasis and hysteria on the MMPI, and higher for somatization and the Positive Symptom Distress Index on the SCL-90. More patients with unconfirmed reactions scored at the 90th percentile or higher for one or more factor scores on the EAT-26. Although there is evidence of psychopathology among the unconfirmed group, it is not clear whether this reflects underlying psychiatric disturbance or adverse reactions to certain foods. 3apsychosocial factors 3afood allergies 3adietary supplements 3aadverse effects 3aadults 0adiet 0acharacteristics1 aGarner, D.M.1 aLeznoff, A.1 aSussman, G.L.1 aTarlo, S.M.1 aKrondl, M.0 tInternational journal of eating disorders.g1991 July, v. 10, no. 4 p.433-439x0276-34787nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle02864naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002400145245013500169300001500304500002400319520120000343650001101543650001901554650001101573650001101584650001101595650001901606650002001625650001301645650000901658650002001667650001401687650001701701650001101718650001901729651002101748651001401769651001301783700002401796700002001820700002001840700001701860700002001877700001901897700001701916700001901933700002101952700001801973700001701991700001902008700002002027700001802047700001502065700001902080773009402099852000902193856004802202655001202250IND4456491520221118052008.0110411e201105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445649152DNAL7 a10.1007/s10584-010-0002-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRosenzweig, Cynthia10aDeveloping coastal adaptation to climate change in the New York City infrastructure-shed: process, approach, tools, and strategies  ap. 93-127.  aIncludes references  aWhile current rates of sea level rise and associated coastal flooding in the New York City region appear to be manageable by stakeholders responsible for communications, energy, transportation, and water infrastructure, projections for sea level rise and associated flooding in the future, especially those associated with rapid icemelt of the Greenland and West Antarctic Icesheets, may be outside the range of current capacity because extreme events might cause flooding beyond today's planning and preparedness regimes. This paper describes the comprehensive process, approach, and tools for adaptation developed by the New York City Panel on Climate Change (NPCC) in conjunction with the region's stakeholders who manage its critical infrastructure, much of which lies near the coast. It presents the adaptation framework and the sea-level rise and storm projections related to coastal risks developed through the stakeholder process. Climate change adaptation planning in New York City is characterized by a multi-jurisdictional stakeholder-scientist process, state-of-the-art scientific projections and mapping, and development of adaptation strategies based on a risk-management approach. 3acities 3aclimate change 3acoasts 3aenergy 3afloods 3ainfrastructure 3amap projections 3aplanning 3arisk 3arisk management 3asea level 3astakeholders 3astorms 3atransportation 3aAntarctic region 3aGreenland 3aNew York1 aSolecki, William D.1 aBlake, Reginald1 aBowman, Malcolm1 aFaris, Craig1 aGornitz, Vivien1 aHorton, Radley1 aJacob, Klaus1 aLeBlanc, Alice1 aLeichenko, Robin1 aLinkin, Megan1 aMajor, David1 aO'Grady, Megan1 aPatrick, Lesley1 aSussman, Edna1 aYohe, Gary1 aZimmerman, Rae0 tClimatic change.g2011 May, v. 106, no. 1 p.93-127dSpringer Netherlandsx0165-00097nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-010-0002-8 7aarticle03926naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002900164245011200193300001600305500002400321500001500345520196400360650002502324650002102349650001002370650001402380650001502394650001302409650001802422650002002440650003802460650001202498650001402510650001602524650002202540650001002562650001902572650006302591650001202654650002902666650003402695650001702729650001302746650006202759650005402821650003102875651001302906653002302919653001502942653002202957653003002979653003103009700002903040700002403069700002103093773011703114852000903231856004803240655001203288IND4447233620221118052100.0110107e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444723362DNAL7 a208782342pmid7 a10.1007/s11250-010-9694-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMansoor, Muhammad Khalid10aPreparation and evaluation of chicken embryo-adapted fowl adenovirus serotype 4 vaccine in broiler chickens  ap. 331-338.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe current study was planned to develop an efficient vaccine against hydropericardium syndrome virus (HSV). Currently, formalin-inactivated liver organ vaccines failed to protect the Pakistan broiler industry from this destructive disease of economic importance. A field isolate of the pathogenic hydropericardium syndrome virus was adapted to chicken embryos after four blind passages. The chicken embryo-adapted virus was further serially passaged (12 times) to get complete attenuation. Groups of broiler chickens free from maternal antibodies against HSV at the age of 14 days were immunized either with 16th passage attenuated HSV vaccine or commercially formalized liver organ vaccine. The antibody response, measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was significantly higher (P < 0.05) in the group immunized with the 16th passage attenuated HSV vaccine compared to the group immunized with liver organ vaccine at 7, 14, and 21 days post-immunization. At 24 days of age, the broiler chickens in each group were challenged with 10³.⁸³ embryo infectious dose₅₀ of pathogenic HSV and were observed for 7 days post-challenge. Vaccination with the 16th passage attenuated HSV gave 94.73% protection as validated on the basis of clinical signs (5.26%), gross lesions in the liver and heart (5.26%), histopathological lesions in the liver (1.5 ± 0.20), and mortality (5.26%). The birds inoculated with liver organ vaccine showed significantly low (p < 0.05; 55%) protection estimated on the basis of clinical signs (40%), gross lesions in the liver and heart (45%), histopathological lesions in the liver (2.7 ± 0.72), and mortality (35%). Birds in the unvaccinated control group showed high morbidity (84%), mortality (70%), gross (85%), and histopathological lesions (3.79 ± 0.14) with only 10% protection.

Data on sap flow, measured by heat pulse, or compensation technique, were compared between two contrasting sites (referred to as sites A and B), characterised by clear differences in the salinity levels of the water table. Site A, located near the karstic Uccellina hills was characterised by more favourable hydrologic conditions as it was likely receiving lateral rainfall drainage from the hills. Water electrical conductivity (EC) values at the upper surface of the water table of this site were lower than 12 dS/m. By contrast, the more typical site B, located further away from the hills, did not benefit from lateral water movement in the soil and showed values of EC of about 17-20 dS/m, half the value of seawater. This amounted to a difference in soil osmotic potential of about 0.4-0.5 MPa across sites. Despite this difference in salinity, measurements of needle water potential during September 2000 did not differ across sites (average of about -1.5 and -2.4 for pre-dawn and midday water potentials, respectively). In contrast to water potentials, the dynamics of sap flow clearly differed across sites. Larger seasonal reductions in maximum daily sapwood-related sap flux density were recorded at site B both during summer (0.005-0.015 10(-3) m3 m(-2) s(-1)) and spring-autumn (0.030-0.045 10(-3) m3 m(-2) s(-1)) than at site A (0.010-0.018 and 0.025-0.035 10(-3) m3 m(-2) s(-1), for summer and spring-autumn, respectively). The different behaviour of water potentials and transpiration rates across sites could be explained by higher values of soil-to-leaf hydraulic resistance at site B during the dry season. Rainfall accumulated in the soil during winter formed a top layer of fresh water, which was then used by plants during the following spring/summer. When fresh water supplies were depleted, the pines drew from the underlying salty water with clear seasonal differences between the two sites. 3aPinus pinea 3acoasts 3adrainage 3adry season 3aelectrical conductivity 3aenvironmental factors 3afreshwater 3aheat 3ahigh water table 3ahills 3aosmotic pressure 3arain 3asalinity 3asandy soils 3asap 3asap flow 3aseasonal variation 3aseawater 3asoil water movement 3aspring 3asummer 3asurface water 3atranspiration 3atrees 3awater potential 3awinter 3aItaly1 aMencuccini, M.1 aPiussi, P.0 tPlant ecology.g2004, v. 171, no. 1-2 p.23-33dKluwer Academic Publishersx1385-02377nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.kluweronline.com/issn/1385-0237/contents 7aarticle02834naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245014800165300001600313500002400329520161300353650002101966650002001987650001202007650001302019650001902032650001502051650001102066650001302077650002302090650001702113650002502130650001102155650001202166650001102178651001502189651002802204700002602232773009702258852000902355856004802364655001202412IND4423694620221118051951.0090724e200907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442369462DNAL7 a10.1007/s10980-009-9349-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKirk, Thomas A.10aDeveloping and testing a landscape habitat suitability model for the American marten (Martes americana) in the Cascades mountains of California  ap. 759-773.  aIncludes references  aWe used field surveys and Geographic Information System data to identify landscape-scale habitat associations of American martens (Martes americana) and to develop a model to predict their occurrence in northeastern California. Systematic surveys using primarily enclosed track plates, with 10-km spacing, were conducted across a 27,700 km² area of largely forested, mountain terrain. Martens were detected at 20/184 (10.8%) of the sample units, aggregated in three distinct regions. We investigated habitat selection at multiple scales using circular assessment areas of 3, 20, and 80 km². The model for the largest assessment area best fit the data and included the following predictors: amount of reproductive habitat, number of habitat patches and land ownership category. These results support the hypothesis that martens select habitat based upon broad scale landscape conditions and that these conditions vary with ownership. We tested the model using an independent set of data, collected primarily during the winter. Poor fit of the test data in some locations raised concerns that our model, which was developed using data collected during the snow-free season, may not predict winter distribution well. We are investigating possible causes for the seasonal variation and until they can be incorporated our model represents a conservative view of marten habitat suitability based on summer occupancy. During the summer months, which is the reproductive season, martens are predicted to occur largely in relatively undisturbed landscapes where high-elevation, late-successional forests are common. 3aMartes americana 3adata collection 3aforests 3ahabitats 3aland ownership 3alandscapes 3amodels 3asampling 3aseasonal variation 3aspatial data 3aspatial distribution 3asummer 3asurveys 3awinter 3aCalifornia 3aCascade Mountain region1 aZielinski, William J.0 tLandscape ecology.g2009 July, v. 24, no. 6 p.759-773dSpringer Netherlandsx0921-29737nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10980-009-9349-5 7aarticle02148naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001700154245012600171300001600297500001500313520107500328650002501403650001701428650002101445650002101466650002001487650001801507650001201525650001701537650001401554653001601568773009201584852000901676856005701685939003301742946001101775655001201786IND9100191120221118052050.0910110e199012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910019112DNAL7 a10.1093/oxfordjournals.aob.a0880882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTurner, L.B.14aThe extent and pattern of osmotic adjustment in white clover (Trifolium repens L.) during the development of water stress  ap. 721-727.  a2019-12-04  aWhite clover plants were subjected to water stress following the cessation of watering. As a water deficit developed, water and osmotic potentials were measured in stolon tips, leaves from the stolon tip and leaves from the plant crown. Pressure potentials were calculated. Pressure potential was maintained in stolon tips even when water potential fell to around −2·0 MPa. In contrast, pressure potential in leaves fell rapidly as water stress developed. Total amino acid and potassium levels were largely unaffected in both stolon tips and leaves. Water-soluble carbohydrates and proline accumulated during water stress. The increase in proline level in leaves did not follow the same pattern as that in stolon tips, although toward the end of the water stress period the level had increased by a similar extent in both parts of the plant. Additionally, pressure potential and osmotic potential appeared to be significantly related to proline content in stolon tips. No such relationship was found for leaves. The role of proline in osmotic adjustment is discussed. 3achemical composition 3abiosynthesis 3aTrifolium repens 3aosmotic pressure 3astress response 3acarbohydrates 3aproline 3awater stress 3apotassium 0aamino acids0 tAnnals of botany.g1990 Dec., v. 66, no. 6 p.721-727wJournal:jnl44715x0305-73647nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oxfordjournals.aob.a088088  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02251naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002200110040001800132100001700150245008100167300001600248500001500264520081000279650002501089650001201114650001601126650001201142650001301154650002801167650002301195650001001218650001201228650007001240650002001310650001801330650002201348650003301370650001001403650001301413650001401426650001901440653001601459653002701475653001501502653002301517653001301540700001801553700001601571773006701587852000901654939003301663946001301696655001201709IND9100175520221118052115.0910109e199012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910017552DNAL7 a20768182pmid7 aPMC12042842pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMooney, J.L.10aGenetic analysis of suppressors of the veA1 mutation in Aspergillus nidulans  ap. 869-874.  a2019-12-04  aLight-dependent conidiation in the filamentousascomycete, Aspergillus nidulans, is contingent on the allelic state of the velvet (veA) gene. Light dependence is abolished by a mutation inthis gene (veA1), which allows conidiation to occur in the absence of light.We have isolated and characterized six extragenic suppressors of veA1 thatrestore the light-dependent conidiation phenotype. Alleles of four genes,defined by complementation tests, were subjected to extensive genetic andphenotypic analysis. The results of light-dark shifting experiments and the phenotypes of double mutant combinations are consistent with the possibility thatthe expression of the light-dependent phenotype is regulated by specificinteractions of the suppressor gene products with the velvet gene product and with eachother. 3aAspergillus nidulans 3aalleles 3asporulation 3aconidia 3amutation 3agenetic complementation 3alinkage (genetics) 3alight 2aAlleles 2aAspergillus nidulansxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aGenes, Dominant 2aGenes, Fungal 2aGenes, Suppressor 2aGenetic Complementation Test 2aLight 2aMutation 2aPhenotype 2aSpores, Fungal 0avelvet gene 0aAspergillus nidulellus 0aregulation 0agenetic regulation 0avea gene1 aHassett, D.E.1 aYager, L.N.0 tGenetics.g1990 Dec., v. 126, no. 4 p.869-874x0016-67317nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03145naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002200110040001800132100001500150245007700165300001800242520139600260650002801656650001601684650001201700650002501712650001701737650000801754650000801762650002201770650001801792650001001810650001301820650001701833650001401850650001201864650001201876650002301888650003001911650003801941650002401979650001102003650001702014650001502031650000902046650003102055650001402086650002302100650002002123650001902143650002702162650002702189653002202216653002502238653001802263653001602281653001702297653001702314700001602331773006902347852000902416939003302425946001302458655001202471IND9100177020221118052001.0910109e199012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910017702DNAL7 a17062902pmid7 aPMC12042692pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeng, X.B.10aCharacterization of Enhancer-of-white-apricot in Drosophila melanogaster  ap. 1061-1069.  aThe white-apricot (w(a)) allele differs from thewild-type white gene by the presence of the retrovirus-like transposable element copia within the transcription unit. Most RNAs derived from w(a) have 3' termini within this insertion, and only small amounts ofstructurally normal RNA are produced. The activity of w(a) is reduced in trans by a semidominant mutation inthe gene Enhancer-of-white-apricot E(w(a). Flies that are w(a) and heterozygous for the enhancer have eyes which are much lighter than the orange-yellow of w(a) alone while E(w(a)) homozygotes have white eyes. This semidominant effect on pigmentation is correlated with a corresponding decrease in whiteRNA having wild type structure, and flies homozygous for E(w(a)) have increased levels of aberrant RNAs. Three revertant alleles of E(w(a)) generated by reversion of the dominant enhancer phenotypewith gamma radiation are noncomplementing recessive lethals, with death occurring during thelarval stage. The effects on w(a) eye pigmentation of varying doses of the original E(w(a)) allele,the wild type allele, and the revertant alleles suggest that the original E(w(a)) allele produces a product that interferes with the activity of the wild type gene and that the revertants are null alleles. We proposethat the E(w(a)) gene product influences the activity of the downstream copia long terminalrepeat in 3' end formation. 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3atransposons 3aalleles 3aincomplete dominance 3acell biology 3aDNA 3aRNA 3aNorthern blotting 3acompound eyes 3acolor 3amutation 3alethal genes 3aphenotype 2aAlleles 2aAnimals 2aBlotting, Northern 2aDNA Transposable Elements 2aDrosophila melanogasterxgenetics 2aEye Colorxgenetics 2aFemale 2aHeterozygote 2aHomozygote 2aMale 2aNucleic Acid Hybridization 2aPhenotype 2aPoly Axmetabolism 2aRNAxmetabolism 2aRNA, Messenger 2aReproductionxgenetics 2aTranscription, Genetic 0arecessive lethals 0along terminal repeat 0acopia element 0aw(a) allele 0ae(wa) allele 0anull alleles1 aMount, S.M.0 tGenetics.g1990 Dec., v. 126, no. 4 p.1061-1069x0016-67317nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03457naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002100152245009800173300001600271500002400287520238900311650002702700653001302727653001402740653000902754653002002763700002202783773014202805852000902947856007602956856005503032930003303087946001103120655001203131IND4386914320221118051910.0070116e200701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438691432DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1095-8312.2007.00753.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSEDDON, NATHALIE10aSong divergence at the edge of Amazonia: an empirical test of the peripatric speciation model  ap. 173-188.  aIncludes references  aThe evolutionary divergence of mating signals provides a powerful basis for animal speciation. Divergence in sympatry strengthens reproductive isolation, and divergence in allopatry can reduce or eliminate gene flow between populations on secondary contact. In birds, the first of these processes has empirical support, but the second remains largely hypothetical. This is perhaps because most studies have focused on oscine passerines, whose song learning ability may reduce the influence of vocalizations in reproductive isolation. In suboscine passerines, the role of learning in song development is thought to be minimal, and the resultant signals are relatively fixed. To investigate the role of song in the early stages of peripatric speciation, we therefore studied a suboscine, the chestnut-tailed antbird Myrmeciza hemimelaena. We recorded male songs in a natural forest island (isolated for < 3000 years) at the southern fringe of Amazonia, and at two nearby sites in continuous forest. A previous study found the isolated population to be weakly differentiated genetically from the ancestral population suggesting that peripatric speciation was underway. In support of this, although we detected minor but significant differences in song structure between each site, the most divergent songs were those of island birds. On simulating secondary contact using playback, we found that pairs from the forest island responded more strongly to island (i.e. local) songs than to those from both non-island sites, and vice versa. This pattern was not observed in pairs from one non-island site, which responded with equal strength to local songs and songs from the other non-island site. Island females were more likely to approach and sing after hearing local male songs, rather than songs from the non-island populations, and vice versa; non-island females did not appear to discriminate between local songs and those from the other non-island site. These findings are consistent with the idea that vocal divergence arising in small populations at the edge of Amazonia may result in partial reproductive isolation when contact is resumed. They also suggest the possibility that song divergence in peripatry may, after much longer time-frames, act as a barrier to gene flow in suboscines, perhaps because of an inability to learn or recognize divergent songs on secondary contact. 3ageographical variation 0aantbirds 0aperipatry 0asong 0asuboscine birds1 aTOBIAS, JOSEPH A.0 tBiological journal of the Linnean Society.g2007 Jan., v. 90, no. 1 p.173-188dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl1847x0024-40667nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8312.2007.00753.x3electronic resource40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8312.2007.00753.x  a20070116b20070202c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02155naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001900152245013000171300001600301500002400317520118000341650002101521653002401542653002701566700001801593773012501611852000901736856007601745930003301821946001101854655001201865IND4386913420221118052044.0070116e200701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438691342DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1095-8312.2007.00715.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBengtsson, Bo.10aDirect and indirect selection in moth pheromone evolution: population genetical simulations of asymmetric sexual interactions  ap. 117-123.  aIncludes references  aFemale moths generally use pheromones to attract males. Normally, all females in a population produce a specific chemical blend with only a limited variance, and the local males are highly attracted to this blend. To better understand the direct and indirect selective forces acting on this communication system, where, unusually, it is the reproductively limited sex that signals for matings, a population genetical model has been constructed and numerically analysed. Basic to the model is the assumption that the pheromone attraction system functions asymmetrically, leading to strong sexual selection between males but no direct sexual selection between females. Evolutionary simulations using the model show that sexual selection in males causes an indirect stabilizing selection on the pheromone blends produced by females. Thus, a more narrow range of pheromone variation is selected for, even in the absence of female sexual selection. The strength of the selection is analysed, and it is suggested that this indirect stabilizing selection becomes particularly important in situations where geographically adjacent populations have evolved different pheromone blends. 3asexual selection 0acomputer simulation 0aevolutionary stability1 aLÖFSTEDT, C.0 tBiological journal of the Linnean Society.g2007 Jan., v. 90, no. 1 p.117-123dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0024-40667nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8312.2007.00715.x3electronic resource  a20070116b20070202c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01705naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001700129245006000146300001800206520085000224650002001074650002201094650001901116650001601135650001201151650002801163653003001191700001601221773009901237852000901336939003301345946001301378655001201391IND9100213320221118051856.0900111e199012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910021332DNAL7 a163483722pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHigson, F.K.10aBacterial degradation of ring-chlorinated acetophenones  ap. 3678-3685.  aTwo strains, Alcaligenes sp. strain ACA and Pseudomonas fluorescens ACB, isolated from acetophenone and 4'-hydroxyacetophenone enrichments, respectively, cometabolize a range of chlorinated acetophenones (CAs). A biological Baeyer-Villiger reaction converts the CA to chlorophenyl acetate. This is evident only in the presence of an esterase inhibitor, since the CA is normally rapidly hydrolyzed to a chlorophenol which has the same substitution pattern as the original ketone. The oxygenase that attacks the ketone uses NADPH in the incorporation of one atom of 18O2 and is strongly inhibited by phenols that bear an ortho or meta chlorine or bromine, but much less by cresols or phenol itself. A feedback phenomenon may thus account for the inability of strain ACA to grow on CAs, which also fail to induce the cells for their own metabolism. 3achlorfenvinphos 3atetrachlorvinphos 3abiodegradation 3aAlcaligenes 3astrains 3aPseudomonas fluorescens 0ahalogenated acetophenones1 aFocht, D.D.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g1990 Dec., v. 56, no. 12 p.3678-3685x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02454naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134072000900152072000900161072000900170072000900179100002400188245013100212300001400343500002400357520102700381650001701408650002001425650001801445650001901463650002001482650001401502650002001516650001001536650003301546650001901579650002801598650002301626650002401649651002401673700001501697773010401712852000901816856007601825930003301901945002501934946001301959655001201972IND4386895420221118052154.0070116e200702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438689542DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1745-4565.2007.00061.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT120 0aQ200 0aT000 0aE7201 aBenny-Ollivierra, C10aHygienic practices by vendors of the street food "DOUBLES" and public perception of vending practices in Trinidad, West Indies  ap. 66-81.  aIncludes references  aThis study investigated the hygienic practices by vendors of street food "doubles" and the public perception of these practices.

Most vendors are male (61.7%), had been vending for 5 years (81.7%) and received primary level of education (72.5%). Preparation of doubles was mainly by family (84.2%) in the morning of vending (81.7%). Vendors were appropriately dressed (99.2%), used forks/spoons (100%) and tongs (81.7%) for serving. At vending sites, containers with faucets supplied water (85.7%) and toilets were not close (97.5%). Most respondents (86.1%) consumed doubles. Some (30.6%) felt ill from eating doubles, but only 2.7% reported to a medical doctor/health authority.

This antimicrobial substance appeared to be proteinaceous because its activity was completely inactivated by proteinase K and α-chymotrypsin. It was heat and pH stable. The apparent molecular mass of the purified bacteriocin, determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, was 8.0 kDa. The amino acid composition of the studied bacteriocin was found to be quite different from known lactococcal bacteriocins. The calculation of the number of amino acid residues in the bacteriocin molecule revealed that it contained 62 amino acids. 3afood spoilage 3atraditional foods 3aGram-positive bacteria 3aacid tolerance 3achymotrypsin 3abacteriocins 3asecondary metabolites 3amolecular weight 3aenzyme inhibition 3acheese starters 3aLactococcus lactis subsp. lactis 3aantagonists 3afood biopreservation 3aamino acid composition 3aantibacterial properties 3abiosynthesis 3aheat stability 3alactic acid bacteria 3acheeses 3apH 3aproteinase inhibitors 3aTurkey (country) 0aisolation1 aDilek Avsaroglu, M.1 aSimsek, O.1 aAkcelik, M.0 tJournal of food safety.g2007 Feb., v. 27, no. 1 p.17-29dBlackwell Publishing Incx0149-60857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-4565.2007.00056.x3electronic resource  a20070221b20070303c00000000  aINDdPNNe2007/02/20  aOther US 7aarticle04166naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134072000900152072000900161100001300170245014100183300001400324500002400338500001500362520236000377650003002737650001102767650000902778650001702787650001402804650001002818650001902828650002502847650001202872650001702884650001202901650001602913650001202929650002802941650001202969650003602981650001103017650002003028653001903048653001203067653002803079653002803107653003303135653003003168700001303198700001403211700001203225700001403237773011903251852000903370856009203379930003303471945002503504946001103529655001203540IND4386906720140723000000.0070116e200702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438690672DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1439-037X.2006.00244.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aF2001 aWang, F.14aThe Differences in Grain Weight and Quality Within a Rice (Oryza sativa L.)

There were significant differences in GW and filling grain percentage (FGP) among superior and inferior grains for compact-panicle varieties (Xiushui 994 and Xiushui 63), while not for loose-panicle ones (Xiushui 11 and Chunjiang 15). The floret-removal treatment significantly improved the development of inferior florets and reduced the differences in FGP and GW between superior and inferior grains for the compact-panicle variety, while leaf-deleting treatment reduced FGP and GW of both superior and inferior grains. For the loose-panicle varieties, the two treatments had little effect. The difference in chalky grain percentage (CGP) and amylose content (AC) between the two kinds of florets was larger in compact-panicle varieties than in loose-panicle ones. Both floret-removal and leaf-deleting treatments caused the changes in CGP and AC of superior or inferior grains for compact-panicle varieties, but not for loose-panicle ones. The difference in starch content (SC) between superior and inferior grains was much larger for Xiushui 994 than for Xiushui 11, and the two varieties differed in the response of SC to the change of source-sink relation. The differences in AGP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (ADPG-Ppase), starch branching enzyme (SBE) and soluble starch synthase (SSS) activities between the two kinds of grains were basically same for the two varieties, with superior being higher than inferior ones at early filling stage and smaller at later stage. In floret-removal treatment, the activities of ADPG-PPase, SSS, and SBE in superior grains of Xiushui 994 decreased at early filling stage and increased at middle or later stages. Meanwhile, the activities of SSS and SBE in both kinds of grains at early filling stage, and of ADPG-PPase and granule-bound starch synthase (GBSS) in inferior grains over the whole stage were increased. In leaf-deleting treatment, the activities of ADPG-PPase and SBE at early filling stage and GBSS at later filling stage were reduced in superior grains, while SSS activity at middle filling stage and SBE activity at later stage were increased. 3asource-sink relationships 3aweight 3arice 3acrop quality 3acultivars 3aseeds 3afilling period 3aplant growth control 3aamylose 3aOryza sativa 3atexture 3arice starch 3aflowers 3anucleotidyltransferases 3apruning 3achemical constituents of plants 3aleaves 3astarch synthase 0ainflorescences 0aenzymes 0aleaf-deleting treatment 0astarch branching enzyme 0aAGPglucose pyrophosphorylase 0afloret-deleting treatment1 aChen, S.1 aCheng, F.1 aLiu, Y.1 aZhang, G.0 tJournal of agronomy and crop science.g2007 Feb., v. 193, no. 1 p.63-73dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0931-22507nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-037X.2006.00244.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20071029b20071102c00000000  aINDd2CTe2007/10/10  aNon-US 7aarticle03362naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134072001700152072001700169072001700186100001500203245011900218300001400337500002400351500001500375520172000390650001902110650001202129650002102141650001102162650002102173650001302194650002102207650002302228650002102251650002602272650001002298650001502308650002402323650002502347651001202372653002402384700001602408700001502424700001902439773013702458852000902595856009202604856005502696930003302751945002502784946001102809655001202820IND4386906320180615000000.0070116e200702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438690632DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1439-037X.2006.00242.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Greater amounts of nitrate in autumn are at risk of being leached during the winter half of the year. In two field experiments, nitrate leaching was measured over 2 years after reseeding of a 9-year-old grassland field in spring on a sandy soil in northwest Germany. During the experiments, major management factors that can influence the intensity of mineralization were varied: Type of fertilizer, mineral N fertilizer or organic manure, and the level of fertilization, 0, 160 or 320 kg N ha⁻¹ a⁻¹, before renewal of the grassland, and level of fertilization, 0, 160 or 320 kg N ha⁻¹ a⁻¹ in mineral form, after renewal of the grassland. The type of fertilization as well as the level of N fertilization before ploughing had no significant effect on the soil mineral nitrogen content (SMN) in autumn and N leaching in the year following the grassland renewal. N fertilizer level after sward renovation had a significant effect on the nitrate leaching losses in the two following years. Fertilization at a rate of 320 kg N ha⁻¹ resulted in leaching losses of 7 and 61 kg N ha⁻¹ in the first and second subsequent years, respectively. At fertilizer rates of 0 and 160 kg N ha⁻¹ leaching losses were lower than 5 kg N ha⁻¹. It is concluded that for mown grassland no restriction of the N fertilization before the renovation of the sward is necessary to reduce the nitrate leaching risk as long as the amount of N fertilized does not exceed the N-uptake by the crop. Similarly, the N fertilization after the sward renewal does not bear a particular leaching risk. 3amineralization 3aplowing 3afertilizer rates 3amowing 3anitrate nitrogen 3aleaching 3alosses from soil 3aseasonal variation 3aland restoration 3afield experimentation 3asward 3agrasslands 3aorganic fertilizers 3anitrogen fertilizers 3aGermany 0amineral fertilizers1 aMüller, J.1 aKayser, M.1 aIsselstein, J.0 tJournal of agronomy and crop science.g2007 Feb., v. 193, no. 1 p.30-36dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl57791x0931-22507nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-037X.2006.00242.x3Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-037X.2006.00242.x  a20071029b20071102c00000000  aINDd2CTe2007/10/10  aNon-US 7aarticle02535naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154072000900163072000900172072000900181100002000190245008400210300001600294500002400310500001500334520108900349650002401438650001601462650002101478650001901499650002301518650001301541650002501554650002101579651001001600653002501610653001501635700002101650700001601671700001401687700001901701700001701720700002101737773010001758852000901858856006901867930003301936945002501969946001101994655001202005IND4386874620221118051932.0070116e20060406xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438687462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jep.2005.09.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aS200 0aX380 0aL600 0aF0001 aVijayakumar, M.10aAction of Hygrophila auriculata against streptozotocin-induced oxidative stress  ap. 356-361.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aHygrophila auriculata (K. Schum.) Heine (Family: Acanthaceae) is a wild herb widely used in 'Ayurveda' as 'Rasayana' drug for treatment of various disorders. Treatment of diabetic rats with aerial parts of Hygrophila auriculata extract (HAEt, 100 and 250 mg/kg body weight) for 3 weeks showed significant reduction in blood glucose, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and hydroperoxide in both liver and kidney. The treatment with HAEt significantly increased the glutathione (GSH), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione S-transferase (GST) and catalase (CAT) in the drug-treated group, which is comparable to the control group. HAEt and glibenclamide-treated rats also showed decreased lipid peroxidation that is associated with increased activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase. The ability of HAEt on tissue lipid peroxidation and antioxidant status in diabetic animals has not been studied before. The result of this study thus shows that HAEt possesses significant antidiabetic activity along with potent antioxidant potential in diabetic conditions. 3ahypoglycemic agents 3aethnobotany 3amedicinal plants 3aplant extracts 3aAyurvedic medicine 3adiabetes 3amedicinal properties 3aoxidative stress 3aIndia 0atraditional medicine 0aHygrophila1 aGovindarajan, R.1 aRao, G.M.M.1 aRao, C.V.1 aShirwaikar, A.1 aMehrotra, S.1 aPushpangadan, P.0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2006 Apr. 6, v. 104, no. 3 p.356-361dElsevier.x0378-87417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2005.09.0303electronic resource  a20070315b20070402c00000000  aINDdMKSe2007/03/15  aNon-US 7aarticle02458naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004300092040001800135072000900153072000900162072000900171072000900180100001700189245010900206300001600315500002400331500001500355520081400370650002301184650001401207650002401221650001201245650001901257650002501276650003001301650001701331650001501348650001901363650002001382650002201402650002701424650002501451650001701476650002301493653001501516653001801531653002101549653001801570653001901588700001601607773010201623852000901725856007701734930003301811945002501844946001101869655001201880IND4386874420221118052025.0070116e200610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438687442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.postharvbio.2006.05.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ115 0aQ205 0aF831 0aQ3051 aSchnabel, G.10aUse of a Muscodor albus pad delivery system for the management of brown rot of peach in shipping cartons  ap. 121-123.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aBiofumigation of peaches in shipping cartons with pads containing culture of the volatile-producing fungus Muscodor albus was investigated for the control of brown rot caused by Monilinia fructicola.

The effect was compared with the activity of indomethacin, cyperoheptadine and dexamethasone against different types of inflammation. The chloroform extract at doses of 50, 100 and 200 mg/kg exhibited significant (P < 0.001) anti-inflammatory activity in acute and chronic inflammatory models. At 200 mg/kg the chloroform extract showed maximum inhibition of 48.12% in carrageenan-induced rat paw oedema while the standard indomethacin inhibited it by 54.32% after 3 h of carrageenan injection. The chloroform extract (50, 100 and 200 mg/kg) significantly (P < 0.001) and dose-dependently inhibited dextran, histamine and serotonin-induced rat paw oedema compared with control group (vehicle-treated). In the chronic inflammatory model, the chloroform extract (100 and 200 mg/kg) inhibited the granuloma weight by 15.42 and 21.12%, respectively, whereas the indomethacin and dexamethasone inhibited it by 29.29 and 34.13%, respectively. The results obtained suggest marked anti-inflammatory activity of the extract at the dose levels examined. 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3amedicinal plants 3aplant extracts 3abioassays 3aedema 3achemical constituents of plants 3aTrichodesma 3aroots 3arats 0aTrichodesma indicum 0amedicinal properties1 aSharma, S.K.1 aPillai, K.K.0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2006 Apr. 6, v. 104, no. 3 p.410-414dElsevier.x0378-87417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2005.08.0773electronic resource  a20070315b20070402c00000000  aINDdMKSe2007/03/15  aNon-US 7aarticle03597naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154072000900163072000900172072000900181100001500190245010300205300001600308500002400324500001500348520191400363650002502277650003102302650001602333650002102349650001902370650001002389650001102399650002102410651002102431653004002452653002202492653002002514653002502534653002102559653002102580653004002601653002102641653002102662653002102683653002502704700001402729700001702743773010002760852000902860856006902869930003302938945002502971946001102996655001203007IND4386871220221118052110.0070116e20060406xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438687122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jep.2005.09.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aS200 0aX380 0aL600 0aF0001 aKupeli, E.10aAnti-inflammatory and antinociceptive activities of Seseli L. species (Apiaceae) growing in Turkey  ap. 310-314.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe ethyl acetate and methanol (80%) extracts obtained from 10 Seseli L. species (Apiaceae) growing in Turkey, Seseli andronakii Woron., Seseli campestre Besser, Seseli gummiferum Pall. ex Sm. subsp. corymbosum (Boiss. and Heldr.)

Koso-Pol., Seseli resinosum Freyn and Sint., Seseli tortuosum L. were evaluated for their in vivo anti-inflammatory and antinociceptive activities. For the preliminary screening of anti-inflammatory activity, carrageenan-induced hind paw edema and for the antinociceptive activity, p-benzoquinone-induced abdominal constriction test were used. Among the plant extracts, the ethyl acetate extracts from Seseli andronakii, Seseli campestre, Seseli gummiferum subsp. corymbosum, Seseli petraeum, Seseli resinosum and Seseli tortuosum showed 30.1, 32.3, 36.9, 39.8, 35.1, 37.6% inhibition in p-benzoquinone-induced abdominal constriction test, respectively. The ethyl acetate extracts of Seseli gummiferum subsp. corymbosum, Seseli petraeum, Seseli resinosum and Seseli tortuosum also exhibited notable inhibition, ranging between 24.5-29.7, 28.1-33.3, 17.4-27.5 and 27.9-31.3%, respectively, in carrageenan-induced hind paw edema model at 100 mg/kg dose without inducing any gastric damage, quite comparable to indomethacin (41.8-44.8% inhibition) as a reference sample. During the acute toxicity evaluation, neither death nor gastric bleeding was observed for any of the plant extracts. Results have supported the traditional use of some Seseli species against inflammatory disorders. Further studies are warranted to define and isolate the active anti-inflammatory and antinociceptive components from the active species which may yield safe and effective agents to be used in current treatments. 3atraditional medicine 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3aethnobotany 3amedicinal plants 3aplant extracts 3aedema 3aSeseli 3aanalgesic effect 3aTurkey (country) 0aSeseli gummiferum subsp. corymbosum 0aSeseli andronakii 0aSeseli petraeum 0aSeseli peucedanoides 0aSeseli tortuosum 0aSeseli campestre 0aSeseli gummiferum subsp. gummiferum 0aSeseli hartvigii 0aSeseli resinosum 0aSeseli libanotis 0amedicinal properties1 aTosun, A.1 aYesilada, E.0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2006 Apr. 6, v. 104, no. 3 p.310-314dElsevier.x0378-87417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2005.09.0213electronic resource  a20070315b20070402c00000000  aINDdMKSe2007/03/15  aNon-US 7aarticle03296naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154072000900163072000900172072000900181100002000190245016700210300001600377500002400393520159400417650002302011650001302034650002102047650001002068650000902078650003602087650001902123650002502142650001302167650001802180650002402198650001402222650000902236650002502245650001602270651001102286653002802297653001502325653001502340700001702355700002702372700001502399700002002414700001302434773010002447852000902547856006902556930003302625945002502658946001102683655001202694IND4386871020221118052039.0070116e20060406xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438687102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jep.2005.08.0752doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aS200 0aX380 0aL840 0aF0001 aKamtchouing, P.10aAnti-diabetic activity of methanol/methylene chloride stem bark extracts of Terminalia superba and Canarium schweinfurthii on streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats  ap. 306-309.  aIncludes references  aStem bark extracts of Terminalia superba Engl. and Diels and Canarium schweinfurthii Engl. are used in Africa for the treatment of various ailments, including diabetes mellitus. The anti-diabetic effects of the methanol/methylene chloride extracts of the stem barks on streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes were evaluated on male rats. Through the subcutaneous route, diabetes was induced using 60 mg/mL of streptozotocin. After 2 days, the rats received, by gavage, 150 mg/kg and 300 mg/kg of extract daily for 14 days. At 300 mg/kg, the two extracts (Terminalia superba and Canarium schweinfurthii), significantly showed at least 67.1% and 69.9% reduction in blood glucose level, respectively, while insulin (three units) given subcutaneously and once daily, had 76.8% reduction compared to diabetic untreated control rats. Similarly, the weight gains were 6.6% and 4.9%, respectively, and were comparable to the normal rats, whereas, diabetic untreated rats lost 14.1% body weight. Still with the same dose, there was 68.5% and 58.5% (p < 0.001) significant decrease in food consumption and 79.7% and 64.0% (p < 0.001) in fluid intake by diabetic rats treated with the respective plant extracts. The insulin-treated rats showed 56.4% and 75.8% decrease in food and fluid intake compared to an augmentation for diabetic control rats, 43.0% and 383.8%, respectively, at the end of the second week of experimentation. These results showed that the plant extracts can reverse hyperglycemia, polyphagia and polydipsia provoked by streptozotocin, and thus, they have anti-diabetic properties. 3aTerminalia superba 3aCanarium 3amedicinal plants 3astems 3abark 3achemical constituents of plants 3aplant extracts 3amedicinal properties 3adiabetes 3ahyperglycemia 3ahypoglycemic agents 3abioassays 3arats 3atraditional medicine 3aethnobotany 3aAfrica 0aCanarium schweinfurthii 0apolyphagia 0apolydipsia1 aKahpui, S.M.1 aDjomeni Dzeufiet, P.D.1 aTedong, L.1 aAsongalem, E.A.1 aDimo, T.0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2006 Apr. 6, v. 104, no. 3 p.306-309dElsevier.x0378-87417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2005.08.0753electronic resource  a20070315b20070402c00000000  aINDdMKSe2007/03/15  aNon-US 7aarticle02740naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154072000900163072000900172072000900181100001300190245010400203300001600307500002400323500001500347520110400362650002501466650003101491650001001522650003601532650001601568650003101584650001901615650002101634650002201655650002701677650001301704651001401717653002501731653002501756653001701781653002501798653002501823700001401848700001601862700001901878700001601897773010201913852000902015856006902024930003302093945002502126946001102151655001202162IND4386867620221118051933.0070116e20060308xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438686762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jep.2005.08.0612doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aS200 0aX380 0aL600 0aF0001 aLi, R.W.10aInhibition of COXs and 5-LOX and activation of PPARs by Australian Clematis species (Ranunculaceae)  ap. 138-143.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe species of Clematis (Ranunculaceae) have been traditionally used for inflammatory conditions by indigenous Australians. We have previously reported that the ethanol extract of Clematis pickeringii inhibited COX-1. In this study, we examined the ethanol extracts and fractions of three Clematis species, Clematis pickeringii, Clematis glycinoides and Clematis microphylla, on cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX). We further examined the activating effects on the protein expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) and gamma (PPARγ) in HepG2 cells. The ethanol extracts of three Clematis species inhibited the activities of COX-1, COX-2 and 5-LOX in the different extents. The stem extract of Clematis pickeringii showed the highest inhibitory activities among the three species on COX-1, COX-2 and 5-LOX with the IC50 values of 73.5, 101.2 and 29.3 μg/mL. One of its fractions also significantly elevated PPARα expression by 173, 280 and 435% and PPARγ expression by 140, 228 and 296% at 4, 8 and 16 μg/mL, respectively. 3atraditional medicine 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3astems 3achemical constituents of plants 3aethnobotany 3alinoleate 13S-lipoxygenase 3aplant extracts 3amedicinal plants 3aenzyme inhibitors 3aprostaglandin synthase 3aClematis 3aAustralia 0aClematis glycinoides 0aClematis microphylla 0alipoxygenase 0amedicinal properties 0aClematis pickeringii1 aLin, G.D.1 aLeach, D.N.1 aWaterman, P.G.1 aMyers, S.P.0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2006 Mar. 8, v. 104, no. 1-2 p.138-143dElsevier.x0378-87417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2005.08.0613electronic resource  a20070314b20070402c00000000  aINDdMKSe2007/03/14  aNon-US 7aarticle02760naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154072000900163072000900172072000900181100002100190245006600211300001600277500002400293520121700317650002301534650002801557650001901585650001801604650001201622650002401634650002001658650002101678650001101699650001001710650001001720650000901730650003601739650001901775650002501794650001301819650002401832650002501856650001601881653002701897700002101924773010201945852000902047856006902056930003302125945002502158946001102183655001202194IND4386867420221118052007.0070116e20060308xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438686742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jep.2005.08.0672doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aS200 0aX380 0aL840 0aF0001 aVillasenor, I.M.10aComparative anti-hyperglycemic potentials of medicinal plants  ap. 129-131.  aIncludes references  aValidation of the ethnobotanical use of the leaves of Artemisia vulgaris Linn.

At the same dosages of 5 mg/20 g mouse, Syzygium cumini-treated mice showed a significant decrease in blood glucose levels (BGLs) at 30 min (α = 0.10) and from 45 min onwards at α = 0.05. Vitex negundo exhibited greater anti-hyperglycemic activity than Eucalyptus tereticornis. Both showed a significant decrease in BGLs at 60 min but at α = 0.05 for Vitex negundo and at α = 0.07 for Eucalyptus tereticornis. There was no significant lowering in BGLs for Imperata cylindrica and Solanum nigrum while there was even an increase in BGLs for Nopalea cochinellifera and Artemisia vulgaris. 3aArtemisia vulgaris 3aEucalyptus tereticornis 3aSolanum nigrum 3aVitex negundo 3aOpuntia 3aImperata cylindrica 3aSyzygium cumini 3amedicinal plants 3aleaves 3astems 3aroots 3abark 3achemical constituents of plants 3aplant extracts 3amedicinal properties 3adiabetes 3ahypoglycemic agents 3atraditional medicine 3aethnobotany 0aNopalea cochinellifera1 aLamadrid, M.R.A.0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2006 Mar. 8, v. 104, no. 1-2 p.129-131dElsevier.x0378-87417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2005.08.0673electronic resource  a20070314b20070402c00000000  aINDdMKSe2007/03/14  aNon-US 7aarticle03015naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154072000900163072000900172072000900181100001400190245015500204300001600359500002400375500001500399520164100414650001602055650002102071650001902092650002102111650001902132650002302151650002402174650001902198651001002217653002702227653002502254700001702279773010202296852000902398856006902407930003302476945002502509946001102534655001202545IND4386868020221118052112.0070116e20060308xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438686802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jep.2005.08.0642doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aS200 0aX380 0aL840 0aF0001 aJainu, M.10aAntiulcerogenic and ulcer healing effects of Solanum nigrum (L.) on experimental ulcer models: Possible mechanism for the inhibition of acid formation  ap. 156-163.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aSolanum nigrum, an herbal plant which is recommended in ayurveda for the management of gastric ulcers. Therefore, the purpose of the study was to investigate the antiulcer effect of Solanum nigrum fruits extract (SNE) on cold restraint stress (CRU), indomethacin (IND), pyloric ligation (PL) and ethanol (EtOH) induced gastric ulcer models and ulcer healing activity on acetic acid induced ulcer model in rats. The treatment with SNE at higher dose significantly inhibited the gastric lesions induced by CRU (76.6%), IND (73.8%), PL (80.1%) and EtOH (70.6%), respectively, with equal or higher potency than omeprazole. SNE showed concomitant attenuation of gastric secretory volume, acidity and pepsin secretion in ulcerated rats. In addition, SNE (200 and 400 mg/kg b.w.) accelerated the healing of acetic acid induced ulcers after the treatment for 7 days. Further, to ascertain the antisecretory action, the effects of SNE on H+K+ATPase activity and plasma concentration of gastrin hormone in ulcerated rats were determined. SNE significantly inhibits H+K+ATPase activity and decreases the gastrin secretion in EtOH-induced ulcer model. The severity of the reaction of ulcerogen and the reduction of ulcer size by SNE was evident by histological findings. Toxicity studies of SNE have also been carried out for its safety evaluation. SNE, thus, offers antiulcer activity by blocking acid secretion through inhibition of H+K+ATPase and decrease of gastrin secretion. These results further suggest that SNE was found to possess antiulcerogenic as well as ulcer healing properties, which might also be due to its antisecretory activity. 3aethnobotany 3amedicinal plants 3aplant extracts 3aherbal medicines 3aSolanum nigrum 3aAyurvedic medicine 3aanti-ulcer activity 3astomach ulcers 3aIndia 0afruits (plant anatomy) 0amedicinal properties1 aDevi, C.S.S.0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2006 Mar. 8, v. 104, no. 1-2 p.156-163dElsevier.x0378-87417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2005.08.0643electronic resource  a20070314b20070402c00000000  aINDdMKSe2007/03/14  aNon-US 7aarticle00878naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245002600125300001400151520015800165650002200323650001600345650001700361650001600378650002400394700001600418773008600434852000900520930003300529945001300562946001300575655001200588IND2037541520221118051854.0940225e199311  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203754152DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWootan, M.14aThe great trans wreck  ap. 10-12.  aTrans fatty acids are believed to a contributor to cardiovascular diseases.

Upon elevated temperatures, heat stress transcription factors (Hsfs) are activated to up-regulate the expression of molecular chaperones to protect cells against heat damages. In higher plants, the phenomenon is unusually complex both at the level of Hsfs and heat stress proteins (Hsps). Over-expression of both Hsfs and Hsps and the use of RNA interference for gene knock-down in a transient system in tomato protoplasts allowed us to dissect the in vivo chaperone functions of essential components of thermotolerance, such as the cytoplasmic sHsp, Hsp70 and Hsp100 chaperone families, and the regulation of their expression. The results point to specific functions of the different components in protection from protein denaturation and in refolding of denatured proteins. 3aRNA interference 3adenaturation 3agenes 3aheat 3aheat stress 3aheat tolerance 3amesophyll 3amolecular chaperones 3aprotoplasts 3astress response 3atemperature 3atomatoes 3atranscription factors 2aDNA, Complementaryxgenetics 2aDNA-Binding Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGene Knockdown Techniques 2aHSP70 Heat-Shock Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aHeat-Shock Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSolanum lycopersicumxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aProtein Denaturation 2aProtoplastsxmetabolism 2aRNA Interference 2aRNA, Plantxgenetics 2aTranscription Factorsxgeneticsxmetabolism.1 aMISHRA, SHRAVAN KUMAR1 aScharf, Klaus-Dieter.0 tPlant, cell and environment.g2009 Feb., v. 32, no. 2 p.123-133dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0140-77917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3040.2008.01902.x 7aarticle02639naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001400149245016400163300001800327500001500345520095600360650002101316650002201337650002301359650002501382650000901407650002901416650002301445650001201468650003801480650001101518650001701529650000901546650002401555650002101579650002101600650003401621650004001655650002501695650003101720653003801751653002201789653002601811653001001837700001501847700001701862700001801879700001501897773008101912852000901993930003302002945001302035946001302048655001202061IND2041229720221118051010.0940803e199405  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204122972DNAL7 a81689262pmid7 aPMC1863792pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLim, P.L.10aTransgene-encoded antiphosphorylcholine (T15+) antibodies protect CBA/N (xid) mice against infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae but not Trichinella spiralis  ap. 1658-1661.  a2019-12-05  aImmunodeficient CBA/N (xid) mice are highly susceptible to Streptococcus pneumoniae infection. Previous studies indicated that this susceptibility may be attributed to the lack of antibodies to phosphorylcholine (PC) in the circulation of these animals. We now provide direct proof that when these mice are genetically manipulated to produce significant amounts of circulating anti-PC immunoglobulin G antibodies of the T15 idiotype, they can be protected against a lethal challenge with S. pneumoniae. Transgenic mice were also used to investigate whether the transgene-encoded antibodies could protect the animals against another PC-bearing microorganism, Trichinella spiralis; in this case, there was no protection. These results were further supported by experiments with CFW mice which had been immunized to produce high levels of anti-PC antibodies but which were found to be just as susceptible to T. spiralis infection as nonimmunized animals. 3aimmunoglobulin G 3aimmunosuppression 3atransgenic animals 3aTrichinella spiralis 3amice 3aStreptococcus pneumoniae 3adisease resistance 2aAnimals 2aAntibodiesxgeneticsximmunology. 2aFemale 2aImmunization 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred BALB C 2aMice, Inbred CBA 2aMice, Transgenic 2aPhosphorylcholineximmunology 2aPneumococcal Infectionsximmunology 2aTrichinella spiralis 2aTrichinellosisximmunology 0aimmunosuppression (physiological) 0aphosphorylcholine 0abiological resistance 0aigg2b1 aChoy, W.F.1 aChan, S.T.H.1 aLeung, D.T.M.1 aNg, S.S.M.0 tInfection and immunity.g1994 May, v. 62, no. 5 p.1658-1661x0019-95677nnas  aDNAL  a19940907b19940913c00000000  aINDdCLD  aOther US 7aarticle02825naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001700149245009100166300001800257520139300275650002601668650000901694650001701703650001501720650001801735650001301753650001701766650001201783650001201795650002301807650002001830650002301850650002701873650003801900650004001938650001101978650001201989650004002001650005202041700001702093700001702110700001502127700001602142773008102158852000902239930003302248945001302281946001302294655001202307IND2041230120221118050906.0940803e199405  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204123012DNAL7 a81689332pmid7 aPMC1863922pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheung, A.L.10aRole of the sar locus of Staphylococcus aureus in induction of endocarditis in rabbits  ap. 1719-1725.  aA regulatory locus on the Staphylococcus aureus chromosome, designated sar, is involved in the expression of cell wall proteins, some of which are potentially important in the pathogenesis of endocarditis. For instance, mutant 11D2 (sar::Tn917LTV1) was found to bind substantially less to matrix proteins (i.e., fibrinogen and fibronectin) than parent strain DB. Remarkably, these two strains did not differ in other phenotypes considered important in the initiation of endocarditis (e.g., binding to platelets and resistance to platelet-derived microbicidal proteins). The isogenic pair were compared for pathogenicity in a rabbit endocarditis model. There were significant differences in infectivity rates between the two strains (71 and 88% for DB versus 17 and 42% for mutant 11D2 at inocula and CFU, respectively). In early adherence studies, parent DB adhered substantially better than the mutant to valvular vegetations at an inoculum of 10(6) CFU (P = 0.05). Southern blot analysis of colonies indicated that the location of the Tn917LTV1 insert in mutant 11D2 remained stable after animal passage. In vitro adherence assays revealed that mutant 11D2 was less adherent to cultured human endothelium than parent DB. These studies suggest that the sar locus is involved in the initial adherence of S. aureus to the fibrin-platelet-endothelium matrix on damaged valvular endothelium. 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aloci 3aendocarditis 3acell walls 3apathogenicity 3aadhesion 3apathogenesis 3arabbits 2aAnimals 2aBacterial Adhesion 2aCells, Cultured 2aChromosome Mapping 2aChromosomes, Bacterial 2aEndocarditis, Bacterialxetiology 2aEndothelium, Vascularxmicrobiology 2aHumans 2aRabbits 2aStaphylococcal Infectionsxetiology 2aStaphylococcus aureusxgeneticsxpathogenicity.1 aYeaman, M.R.1 aSullam, P.M.1 aWitt, M.D.1 aBayer, A.S.0 tInfection and immunity.g1994 May, v. 62, no. 5 p.1719-1725x0019-95677nnas  aDNAL  a19940907b19940913c00000000  aINDdCLD  aOther US 7aarticle03138naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001800129245016800147300001800315500001500333520123500348650001301583650004501596650002001641650002801661650001301689650001801702650001401720650001101734650001701745650002301762650002001785650003001805650001801835650001101853650002201864650002501886650001201911650006201923650002701985650002502012650001802037650004002055650003902095650004602134650004502180650001702225651001302242653001402255700001502269700001702284700001302301700001502314700001802329773008702347852000902434930003302443945001302476946001102489655001202500IND2333163520221118050851.0030620e200211  iau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233316352DNAL7 a124306912pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPadungtod, P.10aIdentification of Campylobacter jejuni isolates from cloacal and carcass swabs of chickens in Thailand by a 5' nuclease fluorogenic polymerase chain reaction assay  ap. 1712-1716.  a2019-12-05  aA rapid 5' nuclease fluorogenic polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for identifying Campylobacter jejuni was applied to Campylobacter isolates from chicken cloacal and carcass swabs collected from three chicken farms and a slaughterhouse in Thailand. The primers and the probe were based on the sequence of the gyrA gene in C. jejuni. C. jejuni isolates were identified by fluorogenic PCR assay of bacterial cells directly from Campylobacter-selective agar medium. This assay allowed the identification of C. jejuni within 1 day after colonies appeared on selective media. The fluorogenic PCR assay yielded results comparable to those of the conventional test kit (kappa = 0.76) but required less time. When the two methods disagreed with regard to species identification, results were confirmed by PCR restriction fragment length polymorphism of 23S rRNA genes. In these instances, the fluorogenic PCR assay correctly identified more isolates of C. jejuni than did the conventional test kit (six of seven isolates were unidentifiable by the conventional test kit). The fluorogenic PCR assay is a rapid and specific method that outperforms the conventional test kit in the identification of C. jejuni from environmental samples. 3achickens 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3aslaughterhouses 3abacterial contamination 3ataxonomy 3aribosomal RNA 3anucleases 3aassays 3afluorescence 3afood contamination 3aselective media 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arapid methods 3acloaca 3achicken carcasses 3aCampylobacter jejuni 2aAnimals 2aCampylobacter jejunixgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aChickensxmicrobiology 2aCloacaxmicrobiology 2aCulture Media 2aDNA, Bacterialxanalysisxgenetics. 2aPolymerase Chain Reactionxmethods 2aPolymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 23Sxanalysisxgenetics. 2aTime Factors 3aThailand 0aisolation1 aHanson, R.1 aWilson, D.L.1 aBell, J.1 aLinz, J.E.1 aKaneene, J.B.0 tJournal of food protection.g2002 Nov., v. 65, no. 11 p.1712-1716x0362-028X7nnas  aDNAL  a20030801b20030801c00000000  aINDdPNN  aNon-US 7aarticle02015naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001300129245008000142300001600222520086000238650001601098650001901114650001701133650002601150650001901176650001701195650002601212650004101238650003101279650002801310650003901338700002201377700001201399700001201411700001101423700001301434773007801447852000901525930003301534945001301567946001301580655001201593IND2328116420221118050928.0020719e200202  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232811642DNAL7 a118158602pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXian, M.10aProduction of linolenic acid by Mortierella isabellina grown on octadecanol  ap. 141-144.  aThe production of linolenic acid in mycelial lipids reached 0.31 mg/ml of culture broth when Mortierella isabellina was cultivated in a medium consisting of 2% octadecanol, 1% yeast extract, and 25 mmol/L of Mg(2+) at 23 degrees C for 5 days.

CLA - particularly the 9c,11t CLA - exerted an inhibitory effect on the initiation and development of these tumours, whereas a similar effect has not been observed in humans, whose intake level is much lower than the threshold required for an antitumour effect to be detectable in rodents. The aforementioned effect has been obtained in animal models at prolonged and high intakes, from 0.5 to 2% of the total energy intake, which corresponds approximately to 5-10 g/day in humans.

Piping has been shown to be a major factor supporting the hypothesis that subsurface flow can be a significant contributor to quickflow by field experiments ranging from the United Kingdom to Canada, India and China. This research has demonstrated that, at least in some areas, soil pipes may contribute up to nearly 50% of stormwater discharge. Piping processes therefore merit inclusion within rainfall-runoff simulation models, but this has yet to be achieved. Some progress has been made in modelling pipeflow itself, but integration within a catchment model presents major problems, not least in quantifying or parameterizing the nature and distribution of pipe networks. The wider environmental implications of soil piping are also only just beginning to be recognized. These range from the effects of changing residence times on water chemistry, especially on the acidification of surface waters, to the effects of hillslope drainage patterns on soil development and vegetation diversity. 3aacidification 3adrainage 3afield experimentation 3ahydrochemistry 3ahydrologic factors 3asimulation models 3asoil 3asubsurface flow 3asurface water 3avegetation 3awatersheds 3aChina 3aIndia 3aUnited Kingdom0 tHydrological processes.g2010 June 15, v. 24, no. 12 p.1548-1566dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x0885-60877nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.7634 7aarticle03105naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092024002200122024001900144040001800163100002600181245015500207300001800362500002400380506007600404520147300480506003701953650001301990650001602003650001302019650001502032650002402047650001502071650001602086650001202102650002102114650002202135650002102157650002702178650001602205650001802221650001402239650001602253651001402269700002802283700001802311773013302329852000902462856008002471856004802551655001202599IND4382620820221207140013.0060806e200608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438262082DNAL7 a10.1128/AEM.00423-062doi7 aPMC15387662pmcid7 a168852722pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMacGregor, Barbara J.10aComparison of rRNA and Polar-Lipid-Derived Fatty Acid Biomarkers for Assessment of ¹³C-Substrate Incorporation by Microorganisms in Marine Sediments  ap. 5246-5253.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWe determined whether a recently developed method to isolate specific small-subunit (SSU) rRNAs can be used in ¹³C-labeling studies to directly link community structure and function in natural ecosystems. Replicate North Sea sediment cores were incubated at the in situ temperature following addition of ¹³C-labeled acetate, propionate, amino acids, or glucose. Eukaryotic and bacterial SSU rRNAs were separated from total RNA by means of biotin-labeled oligonucleotide probes and streptavidin-coated paramagnetic beads, and the ¹³C content of the isolated rRNA was determined by elemental analysis-isotope ratio mass spectrometry. The SSU rRNA yield with the bead-capture protocol was improved by using helper probes. Incorporation of label into bacterial SSU rRNA was detectable after 2 h of incubation. The labeling was always much greater in bacterial SSU rRNA than in eukaryotic SSU rRNA, suggesting that bacteria were the main consumers of the ¹³C-labeled compounds. Similar results were obtained with the ¹³C-labeled polar-lipid-derived fatty acid (PLFA) approach, except that more label was detected in bacterial PLFA than in bacterial SSU rRNA. This may be attributable to the generally slow growth of sediment microbial populations, which results in low ribosome synthesis rates and relatively few ribosomes per cell. We discuss possible ways to improve the probe-capture protocol and the sensitivity of the ¹³C analysis of the captured SSU rRNA.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aacetates 3aamino acids 3abacteria 3abiomarkers 3acommunity structure 3aecosystems 3afatty acids 3aglucose 3amarine sediments 3amass spectrometry 3amicrobial growth 3aoligonucleotide probes 3apropionates 3aribosomal RNA 3aribosomes 3atemperature 3aNorth Sea1 aBoschker, Henricus T.S.1 aAmann, Rudolf0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2006 Aug., v. 72, no. 8 p.5246-5253dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.00423-063Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://aem.asm.org/contents-by-date.0.shtml 7aarticle03269naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092024002200123024001900145040001800164100001700182245011100199300001800310500002400328506007600352520184600428506003702274650002202311650001802333650001702351650001702368650001702385650000702402650002002409650001602429650001202445700001502457700002302472700001302495700001602508700001802524700001702542700001902559700001602578773011502594852000902709856008102718655001202799IND4415956020221207140008.0090206e200902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441595602DNAL7 a10.1104/pp.108.1290072doi7 aPMC26338372pmcid7 a190521532pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Xiaohong10aPhosphatidylinositol (4,5)Bisphosphate Inhibits K⁺-Efflux Channel Activity in NT1 Tobacco Cultured Cells  ap. 1127-1140.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn the animal world, the regulation of ion channels by phosphoinositides (PIs) has been investigated extensively, demonstrating a wide range of channels controlled by phosphatidylinositol (4,5)bisphosphate (PtdInsP₂). To understand PI regulation of plant ion channels, we examined the in planta effect of PtdInsP₂ on the K⁺-efflux channel of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum), NtORK (outward-rectifying K channel). We applied a patch clamp in the whole-cell configuration (with fixed "cytosolic" Ca²⁺ concentration and pH) to protoplasts isolated from cultured tobacco cells with genetically manipulated plasma membrane levels of PtdInsP₂ and cellular inositol (1,4,5)trisphosphate: "Low PIs" had depressed levels of these PIs, and "High PIs" had elevated levels relative to controls. In all of these cells, K channel activity, reflected in the net, steady-state outward K⁺ currents (IK), was inversely related to the plasma membrane PtdInsP₂ level. Consistent with this, short-term manipulations decreasing PtdInsP₂ levels in the High PIs, such as pretreatment with the phytohormone abscisic acid (25 μM) or neutralizing the bath solution from pH 5.6 to pH 7, increased IK (i.e. NtORK activity). Moreover, increasing PtdInsP₂ levels in controls or in abscisic acid-treated high-PI cells, using the specific PI-phospholipase C inhibitor U73122 (2.5-4 μM), decreased NtORK activity. In all cases, IK decreases stemmed largely from decreased maximum attainable NtORK channel conductance and partly from shifted voltage dependence of channel gating to more positive potentials, making it more difficult to activate the channels. These results are consistent with NtORK inhibition by the negatively charged PtdInsP₂ in the internal plasma membrane leaflet. Such effects are likely to underlie PI signaling in intact plant cells.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aNicotiana tabacum 3aabscisic acid 3acell culture 3aion channels 3amyo-inositol 3apH 3aplasma membrane 3aprotoplasts 3atobacco1 aShor, Oded1 aDiminshtein, Sofia1 aYu, Ling1 aIm, Yang Ju1 aPerera, Imara1 aLomax, Aaron1 aBoss, Wendy F.1 aMoran, Nava0 tPlant physiology.g2009 Feb., v. 149, no. 2 p.1127-1140dAmerican Society of Plant Biologistsx0032-08897nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1104/pp.108.1290073Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02886naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002000152245009000172300001600262500002400278520165300302650001401955650001401969650001201983650003501995650001502030650002302045650001702068650001502085650001402100650001502114650001302129650001302142650001002155651001602165700001902181700002502200700002202225700002302247773011802270852000902388856005502397655001202452IND4460107420221118050718.0110715e201108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446010742DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1461-9563.2010.00517.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLogan, David P.10aInfluence of landscape structure on endemic cicadas in New Zealand kiwifruit orchards  ap. 259-271.  aIncludes references  a1 The endemic cicada species Amphipsalta cingulata (Fabricius) and Amphipsalta zelandica (Boisduval) are pests of New Zealand kiwifruit. 2 We determined the abundance of A. cingulata and A. zelandica by counting final-instar exuviae in a block of ‘Hayward' kiwifruit, the dominant cultivar, on each of 70 blocks on separate orchards in the Bay of Plenty, New Zealand. 3 We used a geographic information system and fragstats to generate predictive variables describing landscape structure in four nested landscapes ranging in size between 6.25 and 400 ha for each site. Other variables described the physical characteristics of the site and management practices. Data were analyzed by boosted regression trees, a method that combines the advantages of regression trees and machine learning. 4 The most influential variables differed for each species. Modified coastal landscapes with high densities of ‘Hayward' kiwifruit were most favourable for A. cingulata. For A. zelandica, favourable landscapes contained significant areas of native forest. The 12 most influential variables accounted for 51% and 46% of the total influence of all variables measured for A. cingulata and A. zelandica, respectively. 5 Landscape structure was more influential than insecticide use and local site factors. Despite the apparent low vagility of cicadas, landscape structure at relatively large scales of ≥25 ha was influential for both A. cingulata and A. zelandica. The ability to use a wide range of hosts within the production landscape may account for this pattern. Key variables need to be confirmed by identifying the same patterns in other landscapes. 3aCicadidae 3acultivars 3aforests 3ageographic information systems 3ahost range 3aindigenous species 3ainsecticides 3aintegument 3akiwifruit 3alandscapes 3alearning 3aorchards 3apests 3aNew Zealand1 aHill, M.

In total, 600 specimens were examined. The sex ratio oscillated close to 1 : 1. Females were found to mature at 98.6-120 mm SL (118-145.1 mm TL, compared to 171-254 mm TL in the native North American populations). Spawning took place in May and June, although the spawning period in 2007 was more protracted. Based on the analyses of annual gonadal cycle and oocyte size distribution, the black bullhead is considered a multiple spawner with asynchronous oocyte development and indeterminate fecundity. Absolute fecundity ranged from 1238 to 4755 (mean 2610), and relative fecundity from 36.2 to 154.3 (mean 56.1) oocytes g⁻¹. The high flexibility in the life history of the black bullhead as demonstrated by its non-native populations, as well as its extreme tolerance and capability to live in systems with poor water quality, suggests that this species has a high potential to invade new areas and establish viable populations. 3afecundity 3afemales 3alife history 3aoocytes 3arivers 3asex ratio 3aspawning 3awater quality 3aSlovakia1 aKováč, V.0 tJournal of applied ichthyology.g2009 Feb., v. 25, no. 1 p.79-84dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0175-86597nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0426.2008.01166.x 7aarticle04428naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002900145245012200174300001600296500002400312520308400336650001203420650001303432650001303445650001503458650001003473650001503483650001703498650002003515650001503535650001103550650001903561650001103580650002103591650001503612650000903627650001103636650002003647650001803667650001503685651001003700700002003710700002003730700002203750773010503772852000903877856004803886655001203934IND4433367520221118050814.0100228e201003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443336752DNAL7 a10.1007/s11368-009-0099-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoreno-Jiménez, Eduardo14aThe fate of arsenic in soils adjacent to an old mine site (Bustarviejo, Spain): mobility and transfer to native flora  ap. 301-312.  aIncludes references  aBackground, aim, and scope The mobility of arsenic in soils and its transfer to other environmental components present significant environmental risks. The management of polluted land is determined by the availability, mobility, and transfer of inorganic pollutants to different ecosystem compartments. In this paper, the fate of arsenic at this mining site has been evaluated to determine future management practises to minimise such risk. Materials and methods In a field study carried out in the area adjacent to a mining site at Bustarviejo (North Madrid, Spain), samples of soils, plants, and water were collected from areas adjacent to the core of the former mining activity. The following parameters were investigated in soil samples: pH, organic matter, pseudo-total As, P, and Fe, and labile As and P, and a sequential extraction procedure was performed to investigate As speciation in soil. Plant materials were analysed for both As and P. Arsenic concentrations in water samples (surface and soil pore water collected in the field) were also measured. Results are considered in tandem with previous data on metal concentrations in soils and plants from this site. Results Despite high As concentrations in soils impacted by former mining activities (spoil accumulation and drainage from spoil heaps resulted in concentrations of up to 3,000 mg kg⁻¹), it was not present in a labile form. Sequential extraction revealed that arsenic was mainly retained by Al- and Fe-(oxihydr)oxides (up to 80%). Therefore, only a small proportion of the total soil pool was potentially available for plant uptake (0.3% and 7% extracted by (NH₄)₂SO₄ and NH₄H₂PO₄, respectively). There was very limited transfer of arsenic from soil to plants, and concentrations of arsenic in shoot tissues were relatively low (<8 μg g⁻¹). There was no evidence of phytotoxic effects in the flora that had colonised this site, indicating that a sustainable ecosystem had been established. Discussion High levels of arsenic occur at this site, but arsenic mobility appears to be primarily controlled by the presence of amorphous and crystalline Fe and Al hydrous oxides. Although a low labile As fraction was extracted, concentrations of arsenic in both surface and soil pore water are of concern. The risk of arsenic remobilisation by plant uptake or transfer to the food chain via plant consumption is relatively low in these soils. Large amounts of metals and arsenic remain at the site, and potential risks need to be monitored. Some possible remediation strategies that take into account the presence of both arsenic and heavy metals will be suggested. Recommendations Natural attenuation and phytostabilisation processes are taking place in several parts of the study area. These natural processes could be enhanced by application of both compost and a suitable Fe-based amendment. This augmentation of the re-vegetation of the affected area could act to promote both arsenic and metal stabilisation in mine tailings with additional benefits for further vegetation establishment. 3aarsenic 3acomposts 3adrainage 3aecosystems 3aflora 3afood chain 3aheavy metals 3aland management 3amine spoil 3amining 3aorganic matter 3aoxides 3aphytoremediation 3apollutants 3arisk 3ashoots 3asoil pore water 3asoil sampling 3avegetation 3aSpain1 aManzano, Rebeca1 aEsteban, Elvira1 aPeñalosa, Jesús0 tJournal of soils and sediments.g2010 Mar., v. 10, no. 2 p.301-312dSpringer-Verlagx1439-01087nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11368-009-0099-4 7aarticle01664naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245012000130300001600250520084000266650001001106650000901116650001201125650001201137650001201149650002201161653001001183773010301193852000901296930003301305945001301338946001101351655001201362IND2048652120221118050640.0951108e199505  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204865212DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRosenthal, A.J.10aApplication of aged egg in enabling increased substitution of sucrose by Litesse (polydextrose) in high-ratio cakes  ap. 127-131.  aPrevious reports show that replacing sucrose by polydextrose in cakes leads to an elevation of the starch gelatinisation temperature such that it no longer coincides with the egg protein denaturation transition. It is known that as eggs age, the ovalbumin transforms to S-ovalbumin with a higher denaturation temperature. Linking these observations led to the hypothesis that baking reduced-sugar cakes with aged eggs might bring the starch gelatinisation into proximity of the protein denaturation thereby improving the final texture. Baking trials and instrumental texture evaluations of the resulting high-ratio cakes were carried out with fresh egg and egg that had been aged at 37 degrees C for 3, 7 and 14 days. Texture changes that do exist are principally related to differences in the cake crumb density and crumb springiness. 3acakes 3aeggs 3asucrose 3atexture 3aglucose 3asugar substitutes 0aaging0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g1995 May, v. 68, no. 1 p.127-131x0022-51427nnas  aDNAL  a19951204b19951207c00000000  aINDdJFM  aNon-US 7aarticle01909naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002100110245011700131300001600248520106000264650001001324650002001334650001601354650002101370650001801391700001501409700001401424773010301438852000901541930003301550945001301583946001101596655001201607IND2048651720221118050529.0951108e199505  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204865172DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBen-Ghedalia, D.10aComposition and in-vitro digestibility of carbohydrates of wheat plants harvested at bloom and soft-dough stages  ap. 111-116.  aWheat plants (Triticum aestivum) were harvested at the bloom and soft-dough stages, separated into leaves + sheaths, stems and spikes, and the effect of stage of maturity on neutral detergent fibre (NDF) composition and degradability was studied. the accumulation of starch in the spikes compensated for the decrease in the degradability of NDF polysaccharides so that the in-vitro digestibility of the organic matter (OM) was not changed between the bloom and soft-dough stages. Minor compositional changes occurred in the NDF of the various botanical fractions which can hardly explain the drop in NDF degradability with maturity. There was a decline in the ratio of hemicellulose to lignin, and the changes in NDF-monosaccharide degradability were probably related to the extension of covalent bonding between those matrix components during maturation. Irrespective of botanical fraction and maturity stage, NDF xylose was less digestible than NDF glucose. Between bloom and soft-dough stages there was an increase of 36% in the yield of digestible OM. 3awheat 3amonosaccharides 3adegradation 3afood composition 3adietary fiber1 aKabala, A.1 aMiron, J.0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g1995 May, v. 68, no. 1 p.111-116x0022-51427nnas  aDNAL  a19951204b19951207c00000000  aINDdJFM  aNon-US 7aarticle02822naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100002000149245006000169300001800229520129300247650002701540650002101567650001201588650001401600650002301614650002201637650002401659650002301683650003101706650002301737650002201760650003901782650002401821650006001845650003201905650001601937650002201953650002401975650002301999653001702022700002002039700001702059700001602076700001802092700002002110773008202130852000902212930003302221945001302254946001302267655001202280IND2050699420221118050537.0960408e199503  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205069942DNAL7 a78682232pmid7 aPMC1731052pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChidambaram, M.10aIsolation of Pasteurella haemolytica leukotoxin mutants  ap. 1027-1032.  aTwo mutants of Pasteurella haemolytica A1 that do not produce leukotoxin were isolated. Following mutagenesis, colonies were screened with antiserum by a filter assay for absence of the secreted leukotoxin. The two mutants both appeared to produce normal amounts of other antigens, as judged by reactivity with polyclonal serum from an animal with pasteurellosis, and were not altered in beta-hemolytic activity as seen on blood agar plates. There was no evidence of either cell-associated or secreted leukotoxin protein when Western blots (immunoblots) were carried out with the polyclonal serum or with a monoclonal antibody directed against the leukotoxin. Southern blots revealed that both mutants show the wild-type restriction pattern at the leukotoxin locus, although the strain with the lktA2 mutation showed differences in other regions of the chromosome on analysis by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. The strain with the lktA2 mutation grew more slowly than did the wild-type strain, while the strain with the lktA1 mutation was indistinguishable from the wild-type strain in its growth properties. The strain with the lktA1 mutation should be valuable in determining the role of the leukotoxin in virulence as well as in identifying other virulence factors of P. haemolytica. 3aMannheimia haemolytica 3abacterial toxins 3amutants 3avirulence 3abacterial antigens 3aSouthern blotting 3arestriction mapping 3astrain differences 2aBacterial Toxinsxgenetics 2aBlotting, Southern 2aBlotting, Western 2aElectrophoresis, Gel, Pulsed-Field 2aExotoxinsxgenetics 2aMannheimia haemolyticaxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aMicrobial Sensitivity Tests 2aMutagenesis 2aNitrosoguanidines 2aRestriction Mapping 2aSelection, Genetic 0agrowth curve1 aSharma, Binaya.1 aPetras, S.F.1 aReese, C.P.1 aFroshauer, S.1 aWeinstock, G.M.0 tInfection and immunity.g1995 Mar., v. 63, no. 3 p.1027-1032x0019-95677nnas  aDNAL  a19960503b19960510c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle01972naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245009500127300001600222520084400238650002301082650002901105650001601134650001701150650002301167650001601190650002101206650001601227650002901243650001601272650002101288650000901309653002501318653001201343700001601355700002101371773010401392852000901496930003301505945001301538946001101551655001201562IND2048880220221118050744.0951121e199503  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204888022DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSzymczyk, B.14aThe effect of leaf protein concentrate from red clover on plasma cholesterol level in rats  ap. 299-301.  aThe effect of native and defatted leaf protein concentrate (LPC) from red clover on plasma cholesterol level in rats was studied. Fat-free casein was used as a control protein. The native LPC contained 212 g kg-1 of ether extract and oleic acid (C18:1) was its main fatty acid. LPC protein was relatively poor in sulphur-containing amino acids. Each protein studied was given to rats with or without soya bean oil.

Original fat present in the native LPC though rich in unsaturated fatty acids had no hypocholesterolaemic effect. LPC was hypocholesterolaemic compared with casein in diets not containing added soya bean oil, although the difference did not reach statistical significance. 3aTrifolium pratense 3aleaf protein concentrate 3acholesterol 3ablood plasma 3aexperimental diets 3afatty acids 3afeed formulation 3asoybean oil 3ahigh density lipoprotein 3aamino acids 3anutrient content 3arats 0afat restricted diets 0aclovers1 aGwiazda, S.1 aHanczakowski, P.0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g1995 Mar., v. 67, no. 3 p.299-301x0022-51427nnas  aDNAL  a19960102b19960111c00000000  aINDdRAM  aNon-US 7aarticle02439naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245019300127300001400320500001500334520141200349650001601761650001301777650003101790650002501821650002001846650001301866653002101879700001601900700001801916773010101934852000902035930003302044945001302077946001102090655001202101IND2048647520221118050624.0951108e199505  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204864752DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDepardon, N.10aBreakdown of peptides from a soya protein hydrolysate by rumen bacteria. Simultaneous study of enzyme activities and of two physico-chemical parameters: molecular weight and hydrophobicity  ap. 25-31.  a2019-12-05  aBreakdown of soya peptides by an inoculum of ruminal mixed bacteria was studied in vitro. Peptides were hydrolysed at 75% after 5 h. The dipeptidyl-aminopeptidase type 1 (DAP-1), exoaminopeptidase and leucine aminopeptidase (LAP) activities were measured using GlyArg-MNA, Ala-pNA and Leu-pNA as substrates, respectively. While the total proteolytic activity remained stable throughout peptide breakdown, the DAP-1 already present at the beginning of fermentation was multiplied by two. This peptidase activity is a major index for the presence of Prevotella ruminicola. The exoaminopeptidase activity increased during the exponential phase of bacterial growth. A peak of LAP activity was observed after 3 h of incubation. This activity which was associated to the production of lactate after 3 h suggested the Streptococcus bovis was present in the environment. Measuring by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) gel filtration the size of peptides during their breakdown showed that high-molecular-weight peptides (4000-5000) were apparently more rapidly broken down relative to intermediate peptides (2000-3000) and to small assimilable peptides (1000-500). Separation of soya peptides by reverse-phase HPLC showed a disappearance of hydrophilic and hydrophobic peptides. This study showed that there is no preferential breakdown of hydrophilic peptides relative to hydrophobic peptides in vitro. 3asoy protein 3apeptides 3aphysicochemical properties 3aprotein hydrolysates 3aenzyme activity 3abacteria 0asoybean products1 aDebroas, D.1 aBlanchart, G.0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g1995 May, v. 68, no. 1 p.25-31x0022-51427nnas  aDNAL  a19951204b19951207c00000000  aINDdJFM  aNon-US 7aarticle04270naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001700149245017500166300001600341500001500357520204100372650001902413650002202432650002902454650001602483650001802499650002602517650001602543650001902559650002102578650002202599650001302621650001602634650001802650650001202668650004102680650003602721650005102757650003202808650002002840650003102860650002602891650001102917650003302928650004602961650004403007650004303051650000903094650002103103650004303124650002503167650004803192650003803240650002703278653003803305653001703343653001503360700001703375700002003392773008003412852000903492930003303501945001303534946001303547655001203560IND2050698420221118050736.0960408e199503  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205069842DNAL7 a78682432pmid7 aPMC1730662pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCandolfi, E.10aRoles of gamma interferon and other cytokines in suppression of the spleen cell proliferative response to concanavalin A and toxoplasma antigen during acute toxoplasmosis  ap. 751-756.  a2019-12-05  aSuppressed splenocyte proliferation in response to mitogen and toxoplasma lysate antigen (TLA) is observed in mice acutely infected with Toxoplasma gondii. Recently, we reported that NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (NMMA), an inhibitor of reactive nitrogen intermediate (RNI) production, partially restored proliferative responses of splenocytes from infected mice. In the present study we have examined the effect of NMMA on production of cytokines by splenocytes from mice acutely infected with T. gondii and assessed the role of gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) and interleukin-10 (IL-10) in the RNI-mediated suppression. Stimulation with concanavalin A (ConA) or TLA of splenocytes from CBA/Ca mice infected for 7 days resulted in increased production of IFN-gamma, IL-4, and IL-10 but reduced levels of IL-2 when compared with cultures of splenocytes from uninfected mice. Whereas addition of NMMA did not alter levels of cytokines produced by splenocytes from uninfected mice, splenocytes from infected mice stimulated with ConA produced significantly higher levels of IL-10 and reduced levels of IL-2 and IL-4. Addition of anti-IFN-gamma monoclonal antibodies to cultures of spleen cells from mice infected for 7 or 14 days remarkably decreased the levels of nitrite and resulted in a 47- and 4-fold increase in proliferation induced by stimulation with ConA or TLA, respectively. Anti-IL-10 did not reduce levels of nitrite produced in culture but did result in a fourfold increase in the proliferative response of splenocytes from mice infected for 14 days. In vivo administration of anti-IFN-gamma or anti-IL-10 monoclonal antibodies to infected mice partially restored ex vivo spleen cell proliferative responses by approximately 40 and 15%, respectively. Our data indicate that IFN-gamma is important in inducing the RNI-mediated immunosuppression, which, in turn, affects production of cytokines by splenocytes. Our data also demonstrate that IL-10 is involved in the suppression observed but that this activity is independent of RNI. 3aconcanavalin A 3aimmunosuppression 3alymphocyte proliferation 3aantagonists 3atoxoplasmosis 3amonoclonal antibodies 3asplenocytes 3ainterleukin-10 3aimmunocompetence 3aToxoplasma gondii 3anitrites 3ainterferons 2aAcute Disease 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Monoclonalxpharmacology 2aAntigens, Protozoanximmunology 2aArgininexanalogs & derivativesxpharmacology. 2aCell Divisionxdrug effects 2aCells, Cultured 2aConcanavalin Aximmunology 2aCytokinesxmetabolism 2aFemale 2aImmune Toleranceximmunology 2aInterferon-gammaximmunologyxmetabolism. 2aInterleukin-10ximmunologyxmetabolism. 2aLymphocytesxdrug effectsximmunology. 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred CBA 2aNitric Oxidexantagonists & inhibitors 2aNitritesxmetabolism 2aSpleenxcytologyxdrug effectsximmunology. 2aToxoplasmosis, Animalximmunology 2aomega-N-Methylarginine 0aimmunosuppression (physiological) 0ainterleukins 0ainhibitors1 aHunter, C.A.1 aRemington, J.S.0 tInfection and immunity.g1995 Mar., v. 63, no. 3 p.751-756x0019-95677nnas  aDNAL  a19960503b19960510c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle02662naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245010300168300001600271520138700287592002801674650002401702650001801726650002501744650001301769650001401782650001201796650001301808650002301821650001601844650001901860650000901879650001401888650002001902650002201922651001201944700001901956700001901975700002001994773012402014856008102138852000902219655001202228IND60647018920221118123504.0190614e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064701892DNAL7 a10.1134/S10674136190300202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGandour, Mhemmed10aComparison of Salinity Tolerance in Geographically Diverse Collections of Thellungiella Accessions  ap. 249-255.  aSalinity is a serious problem all over the world with an average of 830 M ha being affected. In order to investigate the screening attributes that can be used to determine early growth stage sensitivity of Thellungiella plants to salt stress, 8 Thellungiella genotypes were grown in pots containing fine sand as growth medium and subjected to five different salinity levels, i.e. 0, 200, 300 and 400 and 500 mM of NaCl. Thirteen phenotypic and physiologic traits related to vegetative growth were evaluated for their responses to salinity stress. Co-relating the different parameters; T. botschantzevii and T. halophila shown to be more tolerant than T. salsuginea. When comparing ecotypes within T. salsuginea, Altai 1 and Altai 2 ecotypes were identified as salt tolerant, Tuva and Buriatia were classified as salt sensitive and the more popular ecotype “shandong” as moderately tolerant. Furthermore, results show that salt susceptible ecotypes treated at 500 mM NaCl had 7 folds higher proline than that of tolerant genotypes treated under similar concentration. These finding indicate the potential for selecting plants or traits with improved salt tolerance within that species. Method used allows detection plants or traits within enhanced salinity tolerance after 2 months of growth for the ability to grow at salt concentration that prevents the growth of other plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEutrema salsugineum 3aculture media 3adevelopmental stages 3aecotypes 3aphenotype 3aproline 3asalinity 3asalt concentration 3asalt stress 3asalt tolerance 3asand 3ascreening 3asodium chloride 3avegetative growth 3aSiberia1 aGharred, Jihed1 aTaamalli, Wael1 aAbdelly, Chedly0 tRussian journal of ecology.g2019 May, v. 50, no. 3 p.249-255dPleiades PublishingwJournal:jnl4237798x1067-41367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S10674136190300203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02336naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245011500158300001800273520102600291592002801317650002601345650001601371650002401387650002101411650001501432650002001447650002201467650001501489650001301504650001801517650001801535650001501553650001301568650002201581700001901603700003101622700002001653700002001673773012601693856007401819852000901893655001201902IND60619239820221122024515.0181031e20181029xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061923982DNAL7 a10.1039/c8gc01424h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZajac, Adrian10aIonic liquids as bioactive chemical tools for use in agriculture and the preservation of agricultural products  ap. 4764-4789.  aOrganic salts called “ionic liquids” have already quite a long history; nevertheless, they still attract major attention from the scientific community and increaselly industry. In this review article, we present the recent progress made in the field of ionic liquids bearing bioactive components, with a particular emphasis on their use as chemical tools in agriculture and the preservation of agricultural products. The article comprehensively describes the use of ionic liquids as bactericides, fungicides, herbicides, wood preservation agents, plants stimulants, growth regulators, and their possible advantages in comparison with conventional, presently used formulations. Ionic liquid's unique properties and multifunctionality are underlined in particular, in order to show their high value as bioactive substances. Moreover, the ILs biodegradability, toxicity, and the methods for their determination and prediction are discussed. An outlook on possible future progression in this field finalizes this article.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural products 3aantibiotics 3abioactive compounds 3abiodegradability 3afungicides 3agreen chemistry 3agrowth regulators 3aherbicides 3aindustry 3aionic liquids 3aorganic salts 3aprediction 3atoxicity 3awood preservation1 aKukawka, Rafal1 aPawlowska-Zygarowicz, Anna1 aStolarska, Olga1 aSmiglak, Marcin0 tGreen chemistry.g2018 Oct. 29, v. 20, no. 21 p.4764-4789dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26906x1463-92707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8gc01424h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02662naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245006600160520139000226592002801616650001801644650001101662650001701673650001901690650002201709650002701731650001401758650002501772650001901797650002501816650002601841650001601867650001401883650001901897650002401916650002001940700002001960700001901980700002501999773012102024856007402145852000902219655001202228IND60757723020221122202226.0211125e20211115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075772302DNAL7 a10.3390/f121115712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVanova, Rozalia 10aEnvironmental Impact of a Mass Timber Building—A Case Study  aThe study focuses on a life cycle assessment of a wood-based residential building and evaluates the magnitude of individual construction components—foundations, flooring, peripheral wall, inner walls, ceiling, roof, windows, and doors—in terms of climate change; acidification; eutrophication; photochemical oxidation; depletion of abiotic elements and fossil fuels; and water scarcity categories within the system boundaries of the Product stage of the life cycle. The assessment was done using the SimaPro software and the ecoinvent database. The results pointed at the advantages of mass timber as a construction material and highlighted the significance in the type of insulation used. Foundations were found to bear the highest share of impact on photochemical oxidation reaching nearly 30% and depletion of fossil fuels accounting for about 25% of that impact. Peripheral wall was ranked the worst in terms of impact on acidification and eutrophication (more than 25% of both), depletion of elements (responsible for 50% of that impact), and had about 60% impact on water scarcity. After adding up carbon emissions and removals, the embodied impact of the whole construction on climate change was detected to be 8185.19 kg CO₂ eq emissions which corresponded with 57.08 kg CO₂ eq/m² of gross internal area.

It is, thus, necessary to review all the aspects that may have a negative effect on their ecosystem functions and the services that they provide. In this paper, a set of indicators is proposed that allow for a preliminary evaluation of some of the main disservices and factors that Mediterranean UFs present and the ways to maximize their benefits for users. For this purpose, 20 indicators, divided into three categories—Biodiversity, Accessibility/Facilities, and Infrastructure—were selected. Within these three categories, a range of values was established, from low to high or absence/presence. The indicators were tested in 24 urban forests of different types, all of which are representative of a medium-sized compact Mediterranean city. The results highlight that the UFs have adequate species richness and diversity, but among the species present are quite a few that emit BVOCs and allergens, as well as some that have invasive behavior. Poor cleaning, absence of night lightning, and scarcity of water points are aspects to improve in a good number of UFs; while a high surface area of impermeable soil, low tree cover, and extensive areas of grass that require large amounts of water for maintenance are the main issues of the infrastructure block that need medium-term planning to be addressed. It can be concluded that the proposed set of indicators allows for a general assessment of the readiness of UFTs in Mediterranean cities for the upcoming climatic, social, and ecological challenges.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3aclimate change 3aecosystems 3agrasses 3ainfrastructure 3alightning 3asoil 3aspecies richness 3asurface area 3atrees1 aCariñanos, Paloma 0 tForests.g2021 Sept. 27, v. 12, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f121013203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02410naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005700094040001800151100002000169245011000189300001400299520142600313592002801739653002101767653002501788653001401813653002401827700001901851773013601870856011702006852000902123655001202132IND60126920320221120062001.0151108e200101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012692032DNAL7 a10.1603/0013-8746(2001)094[0091:BABOPC]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBelliure, Belen10aBiology and Behavior of Pseudodorus clavatus (Diptera: Syrphidae), an Important Predator of Citrus Aphids  ap. 91-96.  aThe behavior and biology of the aphidophagous hoverfly Pseudodorus clavatus (F.) were studied in the laboratory. The survival of P. clavatus larvae fed Aphis spiraecola Patch was 24% from egg to adult, not significantly different from larvae fed Toxoptera citricida (Kirkaldy) (36%). However, larval development was significantly faster on the T. citricida diet and the resulting adults were 50% heavier. Cannibalism of eggs and larvae was common among newly eclosed larvae independent of the presence of aphids, but not among older larvae. The adult sex ratio at eclosion was 0.485 (♀♀:♂♂) but 50% of females died before oviposition. Male flies lived for a mean of 16.8 ±± 3.8 d and ovipositing females for 29.8 ±± 1.9 d at 23°°C. The prereproductive period for females averaged 6 d, and the majority of eggs were laid during morning hours, oviposition peaking between 0830 and 1030 hours. There was no preference among naïïve females to oviposit near either aphid species and eggs were also laid on aphid-infested terminals containing conspecific eggs or larvae. Oviposition was elicited on plant tissues with aphids or residues of aphid honeydew but not on clean plant tissues. Samples of P. clavatus larvae collected from Aphis spiraecola on Viburnum spp. in winter in central Florida were heavily parasitized by the solitary parasitoid Eurydinotelloides bacchadis (Burks) (Hymenoptera: Pteromalidae).  aPublisher supplied data 0aAphis spiraecola 0aPseudodorus clavatus 0aSyrphidae 0aToxoptera citricida1 aMichaud, J.

Parameters of animal density and dispersal were calculated based on the results of live-trap censuses taken before and immediately after the removal trapping. Resident population density in the latter case was accounted for not only by animals that escaped removal but also by those that moved in from surrounding areas during the next few days. Local reduction of animal numbers resulted in increased dispersal.

All 720 larvae, 1,035 adult females and 994 adult males, censused in the field over 3 yr (1997––1999) and in 20 populations located along all the distribution area of the species were living on one single host plant, Hormathophylla spinosa Küüpfer (Cruciferae). This differs from other Old World Timarcha, which are adapted to feed on Plantaginaceae and Rubiaceae. Laboratory experiments confirmed these observational results; all 130 beetles tested fed only on H. spinosa, and no beetle accepted any other plant species either in choice or nonchoice experiments. Larval and adult preference proved identical, both stages selecting only H. spinosa. We suggest that T. lugens has evolved the ability to attack an atypical host.  aPublisher supplied data 0aChysomelidae 0aTimarcha 0ahost range 0afeeding preference 0aspecialization1 aGóómez, Joséé Maríía0 tAnnals of the Entomological Society of America.g2001 Jan., v. 94, no. 1 p.110-115dEntomological Society of Americax0013-87467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603%2F0013-8746%282001%29094%5B0110%3AAALPRA%5D2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02803naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002600144245008000170300001600250500001500266520114800281592002801429650002001457650001201477650001101489650001301500650001901513650001901532650001701551650002901568650001301597650002001610650000901630650002601639650001401665650001901679650002101698650001901719650002301738650001001761653001601771653001701787653002901804653001701833700002601850700002001876700002501896700002601921700002001947700003101967773015201998856007802150852000902228655001202237IND60523050620221119181107.0160605e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052305062DNAL7 a10.1515/znc-2004-5-6092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aInés, Concepcián de10aCytotoxic Activity of Halogenated Monoterpenes from Plocamium cartilagineum  ap. 339-344.  a2019-12-06  aNine halogenated monoterpenes isolated from the red alga Plocamium cartilagineum have been evaluated for their cytotoxic effects on the tumor cell lines CT26 (murine colon adenocarcinoma), SW480 (human colon adenocarcinoma), HeLa (human cervical adenocarcinoma) and SkMel28 (human malignant melanoma) with several multidrug resistance mechanisms and the mammalian non-tumor cell line CHO (Chinese hamster ovary cells). The activities of these compounds were compared with those of the insecticide γ-hexachlorocyclohexane (lindane) due to chemical structure similarities. Compounds 1, 2, 3, and 5 exhibited selective cytotoxicity against colon and cervical adenocarcinoma cells. Interestingly, the effect of compound 3 was specific and irreversible to human colon adenocarcinoma SW480 cells, which overexpress the transmembrane P-glycoprotein often related to chemoresistance. None of the anti-tumor doses of these compounds was cytotoxic against CHO cells.

To investigate the structure–activity relationships of these polymers, low polydispersity polymethacrylates of varying but uniform molecular weight and composition were synthesized, using a reversible addition–fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) approach. In a facile second reaction, pendant amine groups were converted to guanidines, allowing for direct comparison of cation structure on activity and toxicity. The guanidine copolymers were much more active against Staphylococcus epidermidis and Candida albicans compared to the amine analogues. Activity against Staphylococcus epidermidis in the presence of fetal bovine serum was only maintained for guanidine copolymers. Selectivity for bacterial over mammalian cells was assessed using hemolytic and hemagglutination toxicity assays. Guanidine copolymers of low to moderate molecular weight and hydrophobicity had high antimicrobial activity with low toxicity. Optimum properties appear to be a balance between charge density, hydrophobic character, and polymer chain length. In conclusion, a suite of guanidine copolymers has been identified that represent a new class of antimicrobial polymers with high potency and low toxicity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCandida albicans 3aStaphylococcus epidermidis 3aantimicrobial peptides 3aantimicrobial properties 3acations 3acomposite polymers 3afetal bovine serum 3aguanidines 3ahemagglutination 3ahemolysis 3ahydrophobicity 3amammals 3amolecular weight 3astructure-activity relationships 3atoxicity1 aMichl, Thomas D.1 aValentin, Jules

However, these studies are mainly qualitative or conceptual, while comprehensive quantitative research in this field is still missing. This paper aims at filling this gap by quantifying the value of weather information for Oklahoma farmers in all climate regions, based on profitability analysis, USDA NASS and agricultural output statistics, as well as crop budgets from the Oklahoma Extension Center.The results show that the cumulative economic benefits for agricultural production in Oklahoma from utilizing Mesonet information (assuming the profitability factor of 3.7% and with 73% of farmers applying Mesonet) amounted to $183.1 million in 2006–2014 (combining generated profits and prevented losses in agricultural production). Mesonet information was found to provide higher annual economic benefits in terms of prevented losses than additional production profits, especially in drought years. A regional analysis for Oklahoma climate regions revealed the highest cumulative benefits of Mesonet applications in the Southwest ($45.9 million), North Central region ($38.2 million), and in Panhandle ($34.5 million) in 2006–2014. Also, high temporal variations were found for all Oklahoma climate regions.This research is focused on the agricultural sector, while it also sets the baseline for a more holistic understanding of the economic value and benefits of weather information provided by the Oklahoma Mesonet that can further be applied to other sectors in the state.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUSDA 3aagricultural industry 3acase studies 3aclimate 3adecision making 3adrought 3aeconomic valuation 3aenvironmental monitoring 3afarmers 3afarms 3afinancial economics 3ameteorological data 3aprofitability 3aprofits and margins 3aquantitative analysis 3astatistics 3atemporal variation 3aOklahoma 0aWeather and environmental information 0aAgriculture 0aFarm profitability 0aEconomics 0aMesonet 0aDecision-making0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2018 Oct. 01, v. 265 p.503-512dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34709x0167-88097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2018.07.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03273naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002900150245011100179300001800290520201100308592002802319650002002347650001102367650002402378650002102402650001102423650001902434650001602453650000902469650001602478650001302494651001302507653005302520653003702573700002602610700002302636773012302659856008402782852000902866655001202875IND60122841720221117160958.0150428e20131101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012284172DNAL7 a10.1080/02626667.2013.8383222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHanaish, Ibrahim Suliman10aOn the potential of Bartlett Lewis rectangular pulse models for simulating rainfall in Peninsular Malaysia  ap. 1690-1703.  aThe applicability of two versions of the Bartlett Lewis rectangular pulse model, the original and the modified model, is discussed for describing the temporal and spatial variation of rainfall patterns observed at 15 raingauge stations in Peninsular Malaysia over the period 1971–2008; 17 different sets of moment combinations are fitted to these models based on the generalized method of moments approach. The common statistics included in all sets are the mean, variance, lag-1 autocorrelation and the probability of dry based on the hourly rainfall data. The analysis was carried out on hourly rainfall data from all 15 stations for all months of the year. Two stations, Petaling Jaya and Kemaman, located on the west and east coasts of the Peninsula, respectively, are considered for illustration of the results, taking the months of July and November, which correspond to the driest and wettest months, corresponding to the southwest monsoon (May–August) and northeast monsoon (November–February), respectively. The best moment combination found for the illustrative results is based on the common statistics, as well as the mean and variance based on 24-h aggregated rainfall data, the inclusion of which successfully improved the model performance; the errors were significantly reduced. It was also found that the performance of the fitted models based on the mean absolute deviate error varies according to the type of Bartlett Lewis model applied: errors are much smaller for the fitted model based on the modified model as compared to the original model. In addition, the fitted statistics: mean, lag-1 autocorrelation and probability of dry are quite well fitted for several aggregated time scales; however, the variances are underestimated in both models for all aggregated time scales, particularly in the case of the original model. The results of extreme value analysis indicate that the modified model failed to reproduce the annual hourly and daily rainfall extremes satisfactorily.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautocorrelation 3acoasts 3ameteorological data 3amodel validation 3amodels 3amonsoon season 3aprobability 3arain 3arain gauges 3avariance 3aMalaysia 0aBartlett Lewis rectangular pulse rainfall models 0aspatio-temporal rainfall pattern1 aIbrahim, Kamarulzaman1 aAbdul Aziz Jemain,0 tHydrological sciences journal.g2013 Nov. 1, v. 58, no. 8 p.1690-1703dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2013x2150-34357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02626667.2013.8383223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02920naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100001900189245011300208300001300321506007600334520153000410592002801940506003701968650002802005650000802033650002202041650001402063650001902077650001802096650001102114650002102125650002202146650001302168650001002181700001902191700002202210700002402232700002002256773010702276856008202383852000902465655001202474IND60119420420221207045853.0141214e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011942042DNAL7 a10.1186/gb-2011-12-12-r1192doi7 aPMC33346142pmcid7 a221364582pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPont, Caroline10aRNA-seq in grain unveils fate of neo- and paleopolyploidization events in bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)  ap. 2736.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Whole genome duplication is a common evolutionary event in plants. Bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is a good model to investigate the impact of paleo- and neoduplications on the organization and function of modern plant genomes. RESULTS: We performed an RNA sequencing-based inference of the grain filling gene network in bread wheat and identified a set of 37,695 non-redundant sequence clusters, which is an unprecedented resolution corresponding to an estimated half of the wheat genome unigene repertoire. Using the Brachypodium distachyon genome as a reference for the Triticeae, we classified gene clusters into orthologous, paralogous, and homoeologous relationships. Based on this wheat gene evolutionary classification, older duplicated copies (dating back 50 to 70 million years) exhibit more than 80% gene loss and expression divergence while recent duplicates (dating back 1.5 to 3 million years) show only 54% gene loss and 36 to 49% expression divergence. CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that structural shuffling due to duplicated gene loss is a rapid process, whereas functional shuffling due to neo- and/or subfunctionalization of duplicates is a longer process, and that both shuffling mechanisms drive functional redundancy erosion. We conclude that, as a result of these mechanisms, half the gene duplicates in plants are structurally and functionally altered within 10 million years of evolution, and the diploidization process is completed after 45 to 50 million years following polyploidization.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBrachypodium distachyon 3aRNA 3aTriticum aestivum 3aevolution 3afilling period 3agene deletion 3amodels 3amultigene family 3asequence analysis 3aunigenes 3awheat1 aMurat, Florent1 aConfolent, Carole1 aBalzergue, Sandrine1 aSalse, Jérôme0 tGenome biology.g2011 Dec., v. 12, no. 12 p.2736-2736dSpringer-VerlagwJournal:19127x1474-760X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/gb-2011-12-12-r1193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02213naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001200139245007300151300001800224520100700242592002801249650002501277650001001302650001701312650001401329650001901343650001901362650001001381650000901391650001801400650002601418650001801444650001101462650001201473700001501485700001201500700001501512700001401527700001801541700001601559773010801575856007501683852000901758655001201767IND60532751420221118003023.0160728e20131111xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053275142DNAL7 a10.1021/bm401129j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Man10aBiobehavior in Normal and Tumor-Bearing Mice of Tobacco Mosaic Virus  ap. 4032-4037.  aViral nanoparticles (VNPs) have shown great potential as platforms for biomedical applications. Before using VNPs for further biomedical applications, it is important to clarify their biological behavior in vivo, which is rare for rod-like VNPs. In this paper, a study of tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), a typical rod-like VNP, is performed on blood clearance kinetics, biodistributions in both normal and tumor-bearing mice, histopathology and cytotoxicity. TMV was radiolabeled with ¹²⁵I using Iodogen method for in vivo quantitative analysis and imaging purpose. In the normal mice, the accumulation of TMV in the immune system led to a rapid blood clearance. The uptake of TMVs in the liver was less than that in the spleen, which is opposite to the results observed in the case of spherical VNPs. No signs of overt toxicity were observed in examined tissues according to the results of histological analysis. In addition, similar biodistribution patterns were observed in U87MG tumor-bearing mice.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTobacco mosaic virus 3ablood 3acytotoxicity 3ahistology 3ahistopathology 3aimage analysis 3aliver 3amice 3ananoparticles 3aquantitative analysis 3aradiolabeling 3aspleen 3atissues1 aShi, Jiyun1 aFan, Di1 aZhou, Quan1 aWang, Fan1 aNiu, Zhongwei1 aHuang, Yong0 tBiomacromolecules.g2013 Nov. 11, v. 14, no. 11 p.4032-4037dAmerican Chemical Societyx1526-46027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fbm401129j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02683naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245011600160520128000276592002801556650001401584650000801598650001601606650002501622650001601647650002101663650001501684650001201699650001001711650001401721650002601735650001801761650002001779651001101799651002901810700002601839700002301865700002401888700002301912700001701935700003101952700002501983773012202008856007402130852000902204655001202213IND60754213520221120115329.0211023e20210928xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075421352DNAL7 a10.3390/f121013232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWartalska, Pola 10aDothistroma septosporum Not Detected in Pinus sylvestris Seed Trees from Investigated Stands in Southern Poland  aIn recent years, the decline of pine stands in Europe, including Poland, has been caused by the emerging needle pathogen Dothistroma septosporum. Although this fungus appears to preferentially infect Pinus pini, P. pinaster or P. radiata in Southern Europe, it has been reported in stands of P. nigra, P. mugo and P. sylvestris from Southern Poland. Our preliminary tests of symptomatic needles of diseased pines, including black pine (P. nigra), showed the presence of both D. septosporum and D. pini—the latter as the first report in Poland. No other endophytic pathogen, i.e., Lecanosticta acicola or Cenangium ferruginosum, were found. More extensive molecular surveying based on β-tub2 amplification of DNA in needle samples from 72 seed trees of P. sylvestris in nine different Forest Districts of Southern Poland did not find the presence of D. septosporum. Our study revealed that the seed trees from which we collected propagation material were free from the pathogen, and its endophytic behavior was not confirmed in our testing. Consequently, these investigated trees of P. sylvestris should be suitable for seed collection and propagation, following the requirements of “good” phytosanitary quality as “pathogen-free” pine seeds used for reforestation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCenangium 3aDNA 3aDothistroma 3aLecanosticta acicola 3aPinus nigra 3aPinus sylvestris 3aendophytes 3aforests 3afungi 3apathogens 3apropagation materials 3areforestation 3aseed collecting 3aPoland 3aSouthern European region1 aOszako, T.q(Tomasz),1 aBakier, Sławomir 1 aBelbahri, Lassaâd 1 aMalewski, Tadeusz 1 aHsiang, Tom 1 aPopowska-Nowak, Elżbieta 1 aNowakowska, Justyna 0 tForests.g2021 Sept. 28, v. 12, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f121013233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01905naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001800144245010000162300001600262520055100278592002800829650003400857650001500891650002500906650003200931650002300963650001000986650003500996650001401031650000901045650002501054653002401079653002601103653002501129700001601154700001201170700001701182700001601199700001701215773015201232856007801384852000901462655001201471IND60523050920221119181127.0160605e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052305092DNAL7 a10.1515/znc-2004-5-6122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Wei-Min10aAntioxidant Properties of Natural p-Terphenyl Derivatives from the Mushroom Thelephora ganbajun  ap. 359-362.  aThe antioxidant activity in vitro of three poly(phenylacetyloxy)-substituted 1,1′:4′,1″-ter-phenyl compounds from the edible mushroom Thelephora ganbajun were investigated.

Their function in organismal development, however, is less well understood. Here we used genome-wide expression profiling to assess novel functions of the Caenorhabditis elegans HP1 homolog HPL-2 at specific developmental stages. RESULTS: We show that HPL-2 regulates the expression of germline genes, extracellular matrix components and genes involved in lipid metabolism. Comparison of our expression data with HPL-2 ChIP-on-chip profiles reveals that a significant number of genes up- and down-regulated in the absence of HPL-2 are bound by HPL-2. Germline genes are specifically up-regulated in hpl-2 mutants, consistent with the function of HPL-2 as a repressor of ectopic germ cell fate. In addition, microarray results and phenotypic analysis suggest that HPL-2 regulates the dauer developmental decision, a striking example of phenotypic plasticity in which environmental conditions determine developmental fate. HPL-2 acts in dauer at least partly through modulation of daf-2/IIS and TGF-β signaling pathways, major determinants of the dauer program. hpl-2 mutants also show increased longevity and altered lipid metabolism, hallmarks of the long-lived, stress resistant dauers. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the worm HP1 homologue HPL-2 may coordinately regulate dauer diapause, longevity and lipid metabolism, three processes dependent on developmental input and environmental conditions. Our findings are of general interest as a paradigm of how chromatin factors can both stabilize development by buffering environmental variation, and guide the organism through remodeling events that require plasticity of cell fate regulation.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCaenorhabditis elegans 3adevelopmental stages 3adiapause 3aenvironmental factors 3aextracellular matrix 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3agerm cells 3aheterochromatin 3alipid metabolism 3alongevity 3amicroarray technology 3amutants 3aphenotype 3aphenotypic plasticity 3asignal transduction 3atransforming growth factor beta1 aSchott, Sonia1 aBedet, Cécile1 aXiao, Yu1 aRohner, Sabine1 aBodennec, Selena1 aHudry, Bruno1 aMolin, Laurent1 aSolari, Florence1 aGasser, Susan M1 aPalladino, Francesca0 tGenome biology.g2011 Dec., v. 12, no. 12 p.2745-2745dSpringer-VerlagwJournal:19127x1474-760X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/gb-2011-12-12-r1233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01689naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005700094040001800151100002200169245008600191300001600277520066200293592002800955653002600983653001601009653001801025653002201043653002301065653001201088700002301100773013801123856011701261852000901378655001201387IND60126920920221120044229.0151108e200103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012692092DNAL7 a10.1603/0013-8746(2001)094[0159:REOTDD]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSanborn, Allen F.10aRe-evaluation of the Diceroprocta delicata (Homoptera: Cicadidae) Species Complex  ap. 159-165.  aThe Diceroprocta delicata species complex is currently composed of D. delicata (Osborn, 1906) and D. delicata variety aurantiaca Davis, 1938.

At the same time, counterfeit medicines are falsified more and more “skillfully”. According to WHO about 10% of counterfeit drugs are copies of original products.The methods of hyperspectral imaging and image analysis and processing were used to detect counterfeit drugs.Original Viagra® (Pfizer) and counterfeit tablets were compared. Hyperspectral imaging was used to acquire hyperspectral data cubes from both original and counterfeit tablets in the spectral range of 400–2500nm. Spectral parameters for both the original Viagra® and counterfeit drugs were compared. Grey-Level Co-Occurrence Matrix (GLCM) analysis and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) were performed.Hyperspectral analysis of the surface of the original Viagra® and counterfeit tablets demonstrates significant differences in reflectance (maximum difference for 1619.75nm). The GLCM contrast for the falsified drug is on average higher than for the original one 16±4%.GLCM contrast analysis enables to quantify homogeneity of distribution of tablet ingredients and enables to distinguish tablets with identical chemical composition. SWIR (1000–2500nm) hyperspectral imaging has a definite advantage over imaging in VNIR (400–1000nm) – higher wavelength is less sensitive to non-uniform illumination.  aPublisher supplied data 3adeath 3adrugs 3ahyperspectral imagery 3aimage analysis 3aingredients 3alighting 3aprincipal component analysis 3areflectance 3arisk 3awavelengths 0aCounterfeit medicines 0aHyperspectral imaging 0aGLCM 0aMolecular imaging 0aChemical imaging 0aViagra®1 aKoprowski, Robert1 aMarmion, Mathieu1 aDuda, Piotr1 aBłońska-Fajfrowska, Barbara0 tTalanta.g2016 Nov. 01, v. 160 p.1-8dElsevier B.V.x0039-91407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2016.06.0573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03730naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005800148245016200206300001600368520199900384592002802383650002402411650001902435650001102454650002502465650000902490650002702499650002602526650001902552650001102571650002402582650002502606650002002631650001002651650001102661650001502672650001002687653003502697653002602732653003702758653001202795653002802807653001902835700005702854700001902911700002802930700002502958773012502983856008303108852000903191655001203200IND60610150320221119102306.0190705e20181001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061015032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agee.2018.07.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHirte, Juliane1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8873-955X10aBelow ground carbon inputs to soil via root biomass and rhizodeposition of field-grown maize and wheat at harvest are independent of net primary productivity  ap. 556-566.  aBelow ground carbon (BGC) inputs to soil, i.e. root biomass and rhizodeposition carbon (C), are among the most important variables driving soil C dynamics in agroecosystems. Hence, increasing BGC inputs to deep soil is a proposed strategy to sequester C in the long term. As BGC inputs are inherently difficult to measure in the field, they are usually estimated from yield in order to supply soil C models with input data. While fertilization intensity considerably affects above ground biomass, its influence on BGC inputs is largely unclear, especially with respect to the subsoil. Therefore, we determined net root biomass and rhizodeposition C of field-grown maize and wheat at harvest in different farming systems (bio-organic, conventional) and fertilization treatments (zero, manure, mineral) along an intensity gradient in two Swiss long-term field trials. Plants in microplots were repeatedly pulse-labelled with 13C-CO2 throughout the growing seasons and shoots, roots, and soil to 0.75 m depth were sampled at harvest. Despite a strong increase of above ground biomass with increasing fertilization intensity, BGC inputs were similar among treatments on both sites irrespective of soil depth. However, the proportions of rhizodeposition C of BGC inputs averaged 54 to 63% and were, therefore, much larger than the widely adopted 40% for field-grown cereals. They increased with soil depth and were highest under sole organic fertilization. The shift in whole-plant C allocation towards above ground biomass with increasing fertilization intensity entailed 10% higher C allocation below ground in organic than conventional farming for both maize and wheat. Our findings imply that yield-independent values provide closer estimates for BGC inputs to soil of cereals in different farming systems than yield-based functions. We further conclude that fertilization has only little potential to alter absolute amounts of BGC inputs to deep soil in order to sequester C in the long term.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaboveground biomass 3aagroecosystems 3acarbon 3aconventional farming 3acorn 3afertilizer application 3afield experimentation 3agrowing season 3amodels 3aorganic fertilizers 3aprimary productivity 3arhizodeposition 3aroots 3ashoots 3asoil depth 3awheat 0aCarbon allocation coefficients 0aSoil carbon modelling 0aBelow ground carbon partitioning 0aSubsoil 0aFertilization intensity 0aFarming system1 aLeifeld, Jens1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7245-98521 aAbiven, Samuel1 aOberholzer, Hans-Rudolf1 aMayer, J.q(Jochen),0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2018 Oct. 01, v. 265 p.556-566dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34709x0167-88097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2018.07.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03027naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003100148245017500179300001600354520113200370592002801502596002601530596002801556596002201584596002401606596003701630650002901667650002901696650001501725650001401740650001101754650003401765650001201799650002301811650001201834650001301846650002801859650001401887650001501901650001101916700002501927700002701952700002701979700003302006700003502039700003602074700002502110700002002135700006702155773016002222856008202382852000902464655001202473IND60643677720221119193821.0190512e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064367772DNAL7 a10.1007/s10295-018-02119-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ada Cunha, Aureliano Claret10aHigh-affinity transport, cyanide-resistant respiration, and ethanol production under aerobiosis underlying efficient high glycerol consumption by Wickerhamomyces anomalus  ap. 709-723.  aWickerhamomyces anomalus strain LBCM1105 was originally isolated from the wort of cachaça (the Brazilian fermented sugarcane juice-derived Brazilian spirit) and has been shown to grow exceptionally well at high amounts of glycerol. This paramount residue from the biodiesel industry is a promising cheap carbon source for yeast biotechnology. The assessment of the physiological traits underlying the W. anomalus glycerol consumption ability in opposition to Saccharomyces cerevisiae is presented. A new WaStl1 concentrative glycerol-H⁺ symporter with twice the affinity of S. cerevisiae was identified. As in this yeast, WaSTL1 is repressed by glucose and derepressed/induced by glycerol but much more highly expressed. Moreover, LBCM1105 aerobically growing on glycerol was found to produce ethanol, providing a redox escape to compensate the redox imbalance at the level of cyanide-resistant respiration (CRR) and glycerol 3P shuttle. This work is critical for understanding the utilization of glycerol by non-Saccharomyces yeasts being indispensable to consider their industrial application feeding on biodiesel residue.  aPublisher supplied data  aPNPD 2755/2011cCAPES  aPCF-PVE 021/2012cCAPES  a304815/2012cCNPq  a305135/2015-5cCNPq  aPEst-OE/BIA/UI4050/2014cFCT/MEC 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aWickerhamomyces anomalus 3aaerobiosis 3abiodiesel 3acarbon 3acyanide-resistant respiration 3aethanol 3aethanol production 3aglucose 3aglycerol 3aindustrial applications 3asugarcane 3asymporters 3ayeasts1 aGomes, Lorena Soares1 aGodoy-Santos, Fernanda1 aFaria-Oliveira, Fábio1 aTeixeira, Janaína Aparecida1 aSampaio, Geraldo Magela Santos1 aTrópia, Maria José Magalhães1 aCastro, Ieso Miranda1 aLucas, Cândida1 aBrandão, Rogelio Lopes1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8116-59790 tJournal of industrial microbiology & biotechnology.g2019 May, v. 46, no. 5 p.709-723dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl54684x1367-54357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10295-018-02119-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03053naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092024002200121024001900143040001800162100001400180245012900194300001800323506007600341520157200417592002801989506003702017650004102054650002102095650002702116650001302143650001302156650002502169650001602194650001302210650002502223650001202248650001302260650002002273650001402293650001902307650001602326700001302342700001702355773012302372856007902495852000902574655001202583IND4501675820221207082629.0150427e20111215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND450167582DNAL7 a10.1128/JB.05813-112doi7 aPMC32328652pmcid7 a220015142pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, X.13aTheExtended Signal Peptide of the Trimeric Autotransporter EmaA of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans Modulates Secretion  ap. 6983-6994.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe extracellular matrix protein adhesin A (EmaA) of the Gram-negative bacterium Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans is a fibrillar collagen adhesin belonging to the family of trimeric autotransporters. The protein forms antenna-like structures on the bacterial surface required for collagen adhesion. The 202-kDa protein monomers are proposed to be targeted and translocated across the inner membrane by a long signal peptide composed of 56 amino acids. The predicted signal peptide was functionally active in Escherichia coli and A. actinomycetemcomitans using truncated PhoA and Aae chimeric proteins, respectively. Mutations in the signal peptide were generated and characterized for PhoA activity in E. coli. A. actinomycetemcomitans strains expressing EmaA with the identical mutant signal peptides were assessed for cellular localization, surface expression, and collagen binding activity. All of the mutants impaired some aspect of EmaA structure or function. A signal peptide mutant that promoted alkaline phosphatase secretion did not allow any cell surface presentation of EmaA. A second mutant allowed for cell surface exposure but abolished protein function. A third mutant allowed for the normal localization and function of EmaA at 37Â°C but impaired localization at elevated temperatures. Likewise, replacement of the long EmaA signal peptide with a typical signal peptide also impaired localization above 37Â°C. The data suggest that the residues of the EmaA signal peptide are required for protein folding or assembly of this collagen adhesin.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aActinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans 3aEscherichia coli 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aadhesins 3aadhesion 3aalkaline phosphatase 3aamino acids 3acollagen 3aextracellular matrix 3amutants 3amutation 3aprotein folding 3asecretion 3asignal peptide 3atemperature1 aRuiz, T.1 aMintz, K.

Since lignin is a very complex molecule, it is very challenging to cleave bonds in lignin selectively yielding value-added chemicals. Over the years, several methods have been developed for lignin valorisation, e.g., pyrolysis, gasification, hydrolysis, hydrogenolysis, chemical oxidation etc. There has also been much advancement towards lignin valorisation by bioengineering and biorefining. In recent years, visible light photoredox catalysis has emerged as a powerful tool for construction and deconstruction of bonds. In this short review, we discuss three types of lignin depolymerisation methods, reductive, oxidative and redox neutral reactions, and compare the use of transition metal catalysis and photoredox catalysis in the transformations. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the two approaches.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioengineering 3abiorefining 3acatalytic activity 3adepolymerization 3afuels 3agasification 3agreen chemistry 3ahydrolysis 3alignin 3aoxidation 3aphenols 3apyrolysis 3araw materials 3avalue added1 aKönig, Burkhard,0 tGreen chemistry.g2018 Oct. 29, v. 20, no. 21 p.4844-4852dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26906x1463-92707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8gc02073f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03507naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245017000167300001400337520144000351592002801791596005901819596005901878596005901937596007401996596006202070650001902132650003302151650001902184650001802203650000902221650001202230650001302242650001202255650001102267650003102278650001002309650002702319650001302346650001302359650001802372650001102390650001102401650001502412650002202427650001902449650001302468650001102481650002102492700001602513700001602529700001602545700001602561700001802577700002802595700001802623700001402641773011102655856008202766852000902848655001202857IND60647019720221118123511.0190614e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064701972DNAL7 a10.1007/s12042-019-09218-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Huihuang10aDifferential Expression Analysis of Reference Genes in Pineapple (Ananas comosus L.) during Reproductive Development and Response to Abiotic Stress, Hormonal Stimuli  ap. 67-77.  aPineapple (Ananas comosus L.), a popular tropical fruit, is a good model for evolutionary analysis and genetic research on adaptation to drought habitats, multiple fruits, and crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) photosynthesis. Reliable reference genes for the normalization of the levels of development-related and/or stress-responsive genes is important for elucidating the mechanisms of plant development as well as their adaptation to various environments. In this study, ten candidate reference genes were selected, and the expression stability of each gene was assessed across 105 pineapple samples, consisting of different reproductive organs (stigma, petal, sepal, ovule, anther, flower, and fruitlet), abiotic stress (salinity, drought, and cold), and hormones (abscisic acid, ethylene, jasmonic acid, and salicylic acid). Our results revealed that PP2A and UBQ were stably expressed during pineapple reproductive development. PP2A and CYC were the stable reference genes across abiotic stress, whereas RAN and EF1α/PP2A was the best candidates for various hormones. To validate the feasibility of using these stably expressed genes for further experiments, we evaluated the expression profile of AcMYB30 across different samples. Our results provide important insights on the growth and development of the pineapple plant as well as information on stress-tolerance genes and stress-signaling pathways in this important fruit.  aPublisher supplied data  a2018M632564cPostdoctoral Research Foundation of China  a31800262cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aU1605212cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aKFA17439AcSpecial Fund for Science and Technology innovation in FAFU  a2017J01601cNatural Science Foundation of Fujian Province 3aAnanas comosus 3aCrassulacean acid metabolism 3aabiotic stress 3aabscisic acid 3acold 3adrought 3aethylene 3aflowers 3afruits 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3agrowth and development 3ahabitats 3ahormones 3ajasmonic acid 3amodels 3aovules 3apineapples 3aplant development 3asalicylic acid 3asalinity 3astigma 3astress tolerance1 aHu, Bingyan1 aZhao, Lihua1 aShi, Duoduo1 aShe, Zeyuan1 aHuang, Xiaoyi1 aPriyadarshani, S.V.G.N.1 aNiu, Xiaoping1 aQin, Yuan0 tTropical plant biology.g2019 June, v. 12, no. 2 p.67-77dSpringer USwJournal:J000000159x1935-97567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12042-019-09218-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02528naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245011200155520126000267592002801527650002201555650003001577650001501607650001601622650001101638650001301649650001501662650002401677650001201701650001801713650001601731650001901747651001001766700002001776700001601796700002201812700001801834700001901852700001801871773012201889856007402011852000902085655001202094IND60754213720221120115342.0211023e20210928xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075421372DNAL7 a10.3390/f121013252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNiu, Yalin 10aElevation Alone Alters Leaf N and Leaf C to N Ratio of Picea crassifolia Kom. in China’s Qilian Mountains  aLeaf stoichiometry of plants can respond to variation in environments such as elevation ranging from low to high and success in establishing itself in a given montane ecosystem. An evaluation of the leaf stoichiometry of Qinghai Spruce (Picea crassifolia Kom.) growing at different elevations (2400 m, 2600 m, 2800 m, 3000 m, and 3200 m) in eastern China’s Qilian Mountains, showed that leaf carbon (LC) and leaf phosphorus (LP) were similar among elevations, with ranges of 502.76–518.02 g·kg⁻¹, and 1.00–1.43 g·kg⁻¹, respectively. Leaf nitrogen (LN) varied with changes of elevation, with a maxima of 12.82 g·kg⁻¹ at 2600 m and a minima of 10.74 g·kg⁻¹ at 2800 m. The LC:LN under 2400 m and 2600 m was lower than that under other elevations, while LC:LP and LN:LP were not different among these elevations. Except for LN and LC:LN, P. crassifolia’s other leaf stoichiometries remained relatively stable across elevations, partly supporting the homeostasis hypothesis. Variations in leaf stoichiometry across elevations were mainly linked to mean annual precipitation, mean annual temperature, soil pH, and the soil organic C to soil total N ratio. P. crassifolia growth within the study area was more susceptible to P limitation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPicea crassifolia 3aatmospheric precipitation 3aecosystems 3ahomeostasis 3aleaves 3anitrogen 3aphosphorus 3asoil organic carbon 3asoil pH 3astoichiometry 3atemperature 3atotal nitrogen 3aChina1 aKang, Jianfang 1 aSu, Haohai 1 aAdamowski, Jan F.1 aBiswas, Asim 1 aLiu, Chunfang 1 aCao, Jianjun 0 tForests.g2021 Sept. 28, v. 12, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f121013253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01251naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005700094040001800151100001900169245010000188300001600288520027900304592002800583653001200611653002100623653001600644653001200660653000900672700001600681773013800697856011700835852000900952655001200961IND60126921120221120072641.0151108e200103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012692112DNAL7 a10.1603/0013-8746(2001)094[0174:IANGOA]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrailovsky, H.10aIchilocoris: A New Genus of Acanthocephalini from South America (Hemiptera: Coreidae: Coreinae)  ap. 174-178.  aIchilocoris Brailovsky, new genus, and one new species, I. mirabilis Brailovsky and Barrera, collected in Bolivia and Peru, are described in the tribe Acanthocephalini (Coreidae).

It is thus useful to have fast and efficient analytical methods for their control.In this work a non-separative, easy, fast and inexpensive spectrofluorimetric method based on the second order calibration of excitation-emission fluorescence matrices (EEMs) was proposed for the determination of aniline (ANL), 2,4-diaminotoluene (2,4-TDA) and 4,4′-methylenedianiline (4,4′-MDA) in polyamide cooking utensils. The procedure made it possible to identify unequivocally each analyte. Trilinearity of the data tensor guarantees the uniqueness of the solution obtained through parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC), so the factors of the decomposition match up with the analytes. The three analytes were unequivocally identified by the correlation between the pure spectra and the PARAFAC excitation and emission spectral loadings. The recovery percentages found were, 82.6%, 112.7% and 84.4% for ANL, 2,4-TDA and 4,4′-MDA respectively. The proposed method was applied to carry out a migration test from polyamide cooking utensils, using a 3% (w/v) acetic acid in aqueous solution as food simulant. Detectable levels of 4,4′-MDA were found in food simulant from some of the investigated cooking utensils. Finally, a kinetic model for the migration of 4,4′-MDA has been fitted to experimental data obtained in the migration test. Thanks to the selectivity of PARAFAC calibration, which greatly simplifies sample treatment avoiding the use of toxic solvents, the developed method follows most green analytical chemistry principles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetic acid 3aanalytical chemistry 3aanalytical methods 3aaniline 3aaqueous solutions 3acooking utensils 3afactor analysis 3afluorescence 3apolyamides 3arisk 3ascreening 3asolvents 3atoxicity 0aPAAs 0aANL 0a2,4-TDA 0a4,4′-MDA 0aPARAFAC 0aMDI 0aFCMs 0aWHO/IARC 0aLC-MS/MS 0aUHPLC-MS 0aLC–HRMS 0aUPLC-MS/MS 0aPS 0aPE 0aHS-SPME-GC/MS 0aDART-MS 0aRASFF 0aEEM 0aCCα 0aCCβ 0aPrimary aromatic amines 0aExcitation-emission fluorescence matrices 0aPARAFAC 0aMigration test 0aUnequivocally identification 0aBlack nylon utensils1 aSarabia, L.A.1 aOrtiz, M.C.0 tTalanta.g2016 Nov. 01, v. 160 p.46-55dElsevier B.V.x0039-91407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2016.06.0603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02634naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245013400166300001400300520093600314592002801250596005901278596010901337596007901446596009701525650002401622650001601646650002001662650001301682650002701695650001001722650001101732650000901743650001201752650002601764650001301790700001601803700001701819700001101836700001701847700001501864700001601879700005501895773011101950856008202061852000902143655001202152IND60647019820221118123334.0190614e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064701982DNAL7 a10.1007/s12042-019-09219-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Liemei10aDevelopment of InDel Markers for Identification of a Single Mendelian Locus Controlling Leaf Shape in Kenaf (Hibiscus cannabinus)  ap. 78-84.  aKenaf is one of the most important natural fiber crops. The lack of molecular markers has resulted in a large gap in the improvement of kenaf. Previously, de novo 90,175 unigenes in kenaf were assembled. In this study, 7453 small InDels were called from these uingenes. The indel size <5 bp, 5-10 bp and > 10 bp have frequencies of 71.50%, 23.05%, and 5.45%. 337 InDels locating in genes encoding transcription factors were used to survey polymorphisms with 24 kenaf accessions. Of 337 InDels, 305 (90.5%) successfully amplified at least one fragment and detected polymorphism among the 24 diverse genotypes. Furthermore, one InDel marker, HcID266, was co-segregated with leaf shape, which was inherited as a single Mendelian locus, in the F₂ population with 390 individuals. To our knowledge, this is the first large-scale InDels development for kenaf. These InDel markers will be helpful for genetic researches in kenaf.  aPublisher supplied data  a31771369cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  anycytx-19-E06cNational Agri-Industry Technology Research System for Crops of Bast and Leaf Fiber, China  aNongkejiaofa 2011cExperiment Station of Jute and Kenaf in Southeast China  a2010N2002cConstruction of Germplasm Resources Platform of Bast Fiber Crops in Fujian, China 3aHibiscus cannabinus 3afiber crops 3agenetic markers 3agenotype 3ainheritance (genetics) 3akenaf 3aleaves 3aloci 3asurveys 3atranscription factors 3aunigenes1 aWan, Xuebei1 aZhang, Lilan1 aXu, Yi1 aXu, Jiantang1 aLin, Lihui1 aQi, Jianmin1 aZhang, Liwu1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8465-24760 tTropical plant biology.g2019 June, v. 12, no. 2 p.78-84dSpringer USwJournal:J000000159x1935-97567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12042-019-09219-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02798naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002500144245004200169300001600211520136700227592002801594650002101622650001101643650002701654650001301681650002901694650002601723650001701749650001901766650001101785650002001796650001101816650002801827650001301855650000901868650002101877650001001898650001101908653001801919653001801937653001001955700002201965700002201987700002402009700002002033773015202053856007802205852000902283655001202292IND60523051220221119181010.0160605e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052305122DNAL7 a10.1515/znc-2004-5-6152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMansour, El-Sayed S.10aEssential Oil of Daucus glaber Forssk  ap. 373-378.  aThe composition of the essential oil of the fruits, leaves and stems of Daucus glaber Forssk has been studied by GC/MS. It was found that, the essential oil of the fruits consists of monoterpene hydrocarbons (limonene and sylvestrene are the majors) and phenylpropanoids (elemicin is the major). Sylvestrene has never been reported before in the essential oil of any Daucus species. The study of the essential oil of the leaves revealed the presence of monoterpene hydrocarbons; limonene and γ-terpinene are the majors and a small amount of sylvestrene. The essential oil of stems consists of monoterpene hydrocarbons (γ-terpinene is the major), terpene alcohols (mainly 4-terpineol) and phenylpropanoids (myristicin and elemicin are the majors). It is interesting that, the essential oil of the fruits is free from any oxygenated terpenes while that of the stems is free from limonene and sylvestrene which are present in the essential oil of the fruits and leaves in fairly large amounts. The essential oil of the fruits, leaves and stems shows broad antimicrobial activities against both gram positive and gram negative bacteria. In addition, the volatile oil of the stem, particularly, show activi­ties against Candida albicans (yeast). Also, the prepared oils have variable cytotoxic activities with LC₅₀ 21.52, 36.01 and 42.34 μrg/ml. respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCandida albicans 3aDaucus 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aalcohols 3aantibacterial properties 3aantifungal properties 3acytotoxicity 3aessential oils 3afruits 3agamma-terpinene 3aleaves 3alethal concentration 50 3alimonene 3aoils 3aphenylpropanoids 3astems 3ayeasts 0aDaucus glaber 0aEssential Oil 0aGC/MS1 aMaatooq, Galal T.1 aKhalil, Ashraf T.1 aMarwan, El-Sayed M.1 aSallam, Amal A.0 tZeitschrift für Naturforschung.g2014 June 2, v. 59, no. 5-6 p.373-378dVerlag der Zeitschrift für NaturforschungwJournal:21135x0939-50757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/znc-2004-5-6153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03464naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002500189245014400214300001600358520176800374592002802142650002302170650001802193650001702211650001602228650001302244650002402257650001302281650001802294650001502312650001402327650001802341650002202359650001002381650001402391650001902405650002402424650001902448650001002467653001702477653002302494653002802517653001102545653002702556700002002583700001902603773020902622856008202831852000902913655001202922IND60690664620221121162939.0200508e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069066462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jaim.2016.11.0022doi7 aPMC57474932pmcid7 a291378532pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChoudhari, Vishnu P.10aAntidiabetic, antihyperlipidemic activities and herb–drug interaction of a polyherbal formulation in streptozotocin induced diabetic rats  ap. 218-225.  aOjamin (OJ), a polyherbal antidiabetic formulation, is extensively used as a food supplement to control diabetes alone or along with synthetic antidiabetic agents. However, it's phytochemical and pharmacological investigations are lacking.The present study was undertaken to study antidiabetic and antihyperlipidemic potentials of OJ and its interaction with Metformin in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats.Diabetes was induced in Wistar rats by single intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of streptozotocin (60 mg/kg). Antidiabetic, antihyperlipidemic activities of OJ were evaluated at dose of 0.28 ml/kg by estimating biochemical changes in urine, serum and liver tissue homogenate and histological changes in liver and pancreatic tissues. Metformin (100 mg/kg, p.o.) was used as reference standard drug.Results indicate that STZ administration caused hyperglycemia, increased serum glycosylated hemoglobin content, altered serum lipid profile, polyuria, decreased liver glycogen content and histological changes in liver and pancreatic tissues. This elevated serum glucose level and urine volume was significantly decreased by OJ. Supplementation with OJ produced significant improvement in serum lipid profile and glycosylated hemoglobin content along with significant increase in the liver glycogen content. OJ treatment also restored histological changes in liver and pancreatic tissue near to the normal. The observed antidiabetic and hypolipidemic effects of OJ were superior to Metformin. Co-treatment of diabetic rats with OJ and Metformin failed to control blood glucose levels.It is concluded that the OJ possesses significant antidiabetic and antihyperlipidemic activities in rats. However, co-administration of OJ and Metformin is cautioned.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAyurvedic medicine 3ablood glucose 3ablood lipids 3ablood serum 3adiabetes 3adietary supplements 3aglycogen 3aglycosylation 3ahemoglobin 3ahistology 3ahyperglycemia 3alipid composition 3aliver 3ametformin 3aphytochemicals 3areference standards 3astreptozotocin 3aurine 0aAntidiabetic 0aAntihyperlipidemic 0aHerb–drug interaction 0aOjamin 0aPolyherbal formulation1 aGore, Ketkee P.1 aPawar, Anil T.0 tJournal of Ayurveda and integrative medicine.g2017 Oct.,  Dec., v. 8, no. 4 p.218-225dElsevier B.V.aTransdisciplinary University, Bangalore and World Ayurveda FoundationwJournal:27111x0975-94767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaim.2016.11.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02150naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245009000168300001600258500001900274520102800293592002801321650002201349650001101371650001601382650002801398650001301426651001301439653002501452653001101477653003201488653003301520653003601553773010901589856008101698852000901779655001201788IND60688666520221122113542.0200416e20071101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068866652DNAL7 a10.1080/096145207016281472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOslender, Ulrich10aViolence in development: the logic of forced displacement on Colombia's Pacific coast  ap. 752-764.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aA progressive piece of legislation in 1993 granted collective land rights to Colombia's black communities living in the rural areas of the Pacific coast region. This measure aimed partly to support sustainable development strategies in the region through territorial empowering of local communities. Yet 14 years later, the escalation of the country's internal conflict into the Pacific region has created unprecedented levels of forced displacement among rural black communities. Once referred to as a ‘peace haven’, the Colombian Pacific coast is now characterised by new spaces of violence and terror, imposed by warring guerrilla and paramilitary groups, as well as the armed forces. This article examines the nature of the externally induced violence in the region and shows how specific economic interests, in particular in the African Palm sector, are colluding with illegal groups that are used to spread fear and terror among local residents, to make them comply with the requirements of these economic actors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aElaeis guineensis 3acoasts 3afearfulness 3asustainable development 3aviolence 3aColombia 0aGender and Diversity 0aRights 0aConflict and Reconstruction 0aGovernance and Public Policy 0aLatin America and the Caribbean0 tDevelopment in practice.g2007 Nov. 1, v. 17, no. 6 p.752-764dRoutledgewJournal:12201x1364-92137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/096145207016281473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01814naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245008200158300002000240500001900260520080300279592002801082650002301110650001701133650001901150650001801169650002401187650001601211650001301227700001501240700001401255773012401269856007401393852000901467655001201476IND60739086320221117230414.0210526e20210520xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073908632DNAL7 a10.1039/d1ra01188j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLichuanjushi,10aNovel hydrophobic catalysts to promote hydration at the water–oil interface  ap. 18299-18307.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe limitation of the cyclohexene hydration reaction is that it is a three-phase immiscible reaction. We have described a strategy to overcome this interfacial mass transfer limitation by grafting an organosilane surfactant ((octyl)-trimethoxysilane (OTS)) onto the HZSM-5 zeolite surface. The characterization of the OTS-HZSM-5 zeolite was performed by FTIR, CA, BET, TPD, pyridine-IR, XPS, TGA and XRD techniques. The functionalization of the HZSM-5 zeolite could increase hydrophobicity without significantly reducing the density of acid sites. As a result, the OTS-HZSM-5 zeolite had high catalytic activity (20.87% conversion) compared with HZSM-5 (4.15% conversion) at 130 °C after 4 h. The high catalytic activity makes it a promising candidate for other acid-catalyzed two-phase reactions.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalytic activity 3acyclohexenes 3ahydrophobicity 3amass transfer 3aoil-water interface 3asurfactants 3azeolites1 aSun, Dahai1 aTian, Hui0 tRSC advances.g2021 May 20, v. 11, no. 30 p.18299-18307dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1ra01188j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02565naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245011900172520110700291592002801398650001801426650001101444650001101455650000901466650001701475650002401492650001201516650001601528650001501544650001401559650001201573651001201585653002201597653001301619653001701632653001701649653001601666653000801682700001601690700001901706700001601725700002401741700002001765700001701785700001801802700001201820773011901832856008701951852000902038655001202047IND60761046520221123044732.0220207e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076104652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.revpalbo.2021.1045922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNguyen, Hung Ba10aFirst pod record of Mucuna (Papilionoideae, Fabaceae) from the late Miocene of the Yen Bai Basin, northern Vietnam  aThe genus Mucuna Adans. (Papilionoideae, Fabaceae) contains approximately 105 extant species. It is widely distributed in pantropical areas, with its center of diversity located in Asia. Recent molecular phylogenetic analyses investigated the historical biogeography of the genus; however, a lack of fossil evidence has limited a fuller understanding of the genus. Here, we present the first macrofossil record of Mucuna in the form of pod, collected from late Miocene sediments of the Yen Bai Basin, northern Vietnam. This fossil specimen is characterized by linear-oblong, compressed, torulose, slightly curved pods containing at least three to five seeds, a pair of thickened marginal wings, and an apex with a cone-shaped beak. Detailed morphological observation indicates that these fossil pods belong to Mucuna, and are provisionally assigned to M. cf. birdwoodiana Tutcher. Our discovery supports the hypothesis that Mucuna originated in Asia; moreover, it implies that the genus has been present and has adapted to the humid tropical climate in northern Vietnam since at least the late Miocene.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMiocene epoch 3aMucuna 3abasins 3abeak 3abiogeography 3acenter of diversity 3afossils 3apaleobotany 3apalynology 3aphylogeny 3atropics 3aVietnam 0aCo Phuc Formation 0aFabaceae 0aLate Miocene 0aPaleoclimate 0aPantropical 0aPod1 aHuang, Jian1 aVan Do, Truong1 aJia, Lin-Bo1 aNguyen, Hoa Mai Thi1 aDoan, Hung Dinh1 aLi, Shu-Feng1 aZhou, Zhe-Kun1 aSu, Tao0 tReview of palaeobotany and palynology.g2022 Mar., v. 298 p.104592-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11736x0034-66677nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.revpalbo.2021.1045923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03391naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002500153245010300178300001800281520178300299592002802082650000802110650001002118650002602128650003202154650001302186650002002199650001502219650001402234650002502248650004302273650000902316650001102325650001102336650001102347650001802358650001302376651001802389651001202407653000802419653002902427653000902456653001702465653001102482653002902493700002002522700002502542700003102567700002102598773012102619856008802740852000902828655001202837IND60609857820221120211647.0201125e20181115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060985782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.06.0832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHayward, Jennifer L.10aFate of antibiotic resistance genes in two Arctic tundra wetlands impacted by municipal wastewater  ap. 1415-1428.  aIn the Canadian Arctic, it is common practice to discharge municipal wastewater into tundra wetlands. Antibiotic resistant bacteria and the antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) they contain can be present in municipal wastewater and there is a scarcity of knowledge on ARGs in wastewater in Arctic environments. This study was initiated on the fate of ARGs in tundra wetland ecosystems impacted by anthropogenic wastewater sources in Arctic communities. In the summer season of 2016, two wetlands were studied in the Inuit communities of Sanikiluaq and Naujaat in Nunavut, Canada. Genomic DNA was extracted from both soil and water during the spring freshet and late summer in the wetlands, and a suite of nine clinically relevant ARGs (sul1, sul2, mecA, vanA, qnrS, ermB, tetO, blaTEM, blaCTX₋M), and an integron gene (int1) were analyzed using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Hydrological and water quality measurements were conducted in conjunction with the microbiological sampling. Gene targets were consistently present in the wastewater, and throughout both wetlands, except for vanA and mecA. Concentrations of ARGs were greater during the spring freshet, due to short hydraulic retention times (<2 days), which coincided with decreased treatment performance. The environmental resistome in un-impacted wetlands had above detection limit concentrations of int1, sul1, sul2, blaCTX₋M in water in Naujaat, and sul1, qnrS and tetO in soil in Sanikiluaq. First-order rate constants were widely variable and specific to the gene target. ARGs were present in concentrations elevated above baseline reference sites in tundra wetlands influenced by municipal wastewater, and hydrological conditions had a large impact on their spatial distribution and levels.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aInuit 3aantibiotic resistance 3aantibiotic resistance genes 3abacteria 3adetection limit 3aecosystems 3ahydrology 3amunicipal wastewater 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asoil 3aspring 3asummer 3atundra 3awater quality 3awetlands 3aArctic region 3aNunavut 0aARG 0aTundra wetland hydrology 0aqPCR 0aCold climate 0aArctic 0aAntimicrobial resistance1 aJackson, Amy J.1 aYost, Christopher K.1 aTruelstrup Hansen, Lisbeth1 aJamieson, Rob C.0 tScience of the total environment.g2018 Nov. 15, v. 642 p.1415-1428dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.06.0833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03122naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002600164245009100190300001400281520153200295592002801827650001601855650001301871650002001884650002001904650001001924650001401934650000901948650001301957650001301970650001101983650001501994650001002009650001002019650002102029650001302050650001102063650001302074650000902087650002602096650001602122650001602138651001802154651003302172700002002205700001502225700002202240700001602262700002002278700001802298700001802316700001702334773011202351856004802463852000902511655001202520IND4476321720221119112400.0121003e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447632172DNAL7 a211612882pmid7 a10.1007/s00484-010-0391-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrundstein, Andrew J.12aA retrospective analysis of American football hyperthermia deaths in the United States  ap. 11-20.  aOver the period 1980–2009, there were 58 documented hyperthermia deaths of American-style football players in the United States. This study examines the geography, timing, and meteorological conditions present during the onset of hyperthermia, using the most complete dataset available. Deaths are concentrated in the eastern quadrant of the United States and are most common during August. Over half the deaths occurred during morning practices when high humidity levels were common. The athletes were typically large (79% with a body mass index >30) and mostly (86%) played linemen positions. Meteorological conditions were atypically hot and humid by local standards on most days with fatalities. Further, all deaths occurred under conditions defined as high or extreme by the American College of Sports Medicine using the wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT), but under lower threat levels using the heat index (HI). Football-specific thresholds based on clothing (full football uniform, practice uniform, or shorts) were also examined. The thresholds matched well with data from athletes wearing practice uniforms but poorly for those in shorts only. Too few cases of athletes in full pads were available to draw any broad conclusions. We recommend that coaches carefully monitor players, particularly large linemen, early in the pre-season on days with wet bulb globe temperatures that are categorized as high or extreme. Also, as most of the deaths were among young athletes, longer acclimatization periods may be needed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacclimation 3aathletes 3abody mass index 3adata collection 3afever 3ageography 3aheat 3ahumidity 3amedicine 3asports 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aChild 2aFeverxmortality 2aFootball 2aHumans 2aHumidity 2aMale 2aRetrospective Studies 2aTemperature 2aYoung Adult 3aUnited States 0aUnited Statesxepidemiology.1 aRamseyer, Craig1 aZhao, Fang1 aPesses, Jordan L.1 aAkers, Pete1 aQureshi, Aneela1 aBecker, Laura1 aKnox, John A.1 aPetro, Myron0 tInternational journal of biometeorology.g2012 Jan., v. 56, no. 1 p.11-20dSpringer-Verlagx0020-71287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00484-010-0391-4  aDNAL 7aarticle02643naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006100148245008900209300001600298500001900314520141300333592002801746650002201774650002701796650002201823650001001845650001001855650001301865650002701878650001101905650001401916650001801930651001501948700002801963700002201991700002502013773011602038856008202154852000902236655001202245IND60734729220221122025411.0210422e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073472922DNAL7 a10.1007/s13364-021-00565-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJackson, Kathrina1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3592-294810aFirst documentation of scent-marking behaviors in striped skunks (Mephitis mephitis)  ap. 399-404.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aCommunication behaviors play a critical role in both an individual’s fitness as well as the viability of populations. Solitary animals use chemical communication (i.e., scent marking) to locate mates and defend their territory to increase their own fitness. Previous research has suggested that striped skunks (Mephitis mephitis) do not perform scent-marking behaviors, despite being best known for using odor as chemical defense. We used video camera traps to document behaviors exhibited by striped skunks at a remote site in coastal California between January 2012 and April 2015. Our camera traps captured a total of 71 visits by striped skunks, the majority of which (73%) included a striped skunk exhibiting scent-marking behaviors. Overall, we documented 8 different scent-marking behaviors. The most frequent behaviors we documented were cheek rubbing (45.1%), investigating (40.8%), and claw marking (35.2%). The behaviors exhibited for the longest durations on average were grooming ([Formula: see text] = 34. 4 s) and investigating ([Formula: see text] = 21.2 s). Although previous research suggested that striped skunks do not scent mark, we documented that at least some populations do and our findings suggest that certain sites are used for communication via scent marking. Our study further highlights how camera traps allow researchers to discover previously undocumented animal behaviors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMephitis mephitis 3achemical communication 3achemical defenses 3aclaws 3aodors 3aresearch 3ascent marking behavior 3askunks 3aviability 3avideo cameras 3aCalifornia1 aWilmers, Christopher C.1 aWittmer, Heiko U.1 aAllen, Maximilian L.0 tMammal research.g2021 Apr., v. 66, no. 2 p.399-404dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:12555x2199-24017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13364-021-00565-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02200naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132100002800150245013800178300001800316520094300334592002801277650001601305650001401321650001201335650001401347650001701361650001201378650002301390650000901413650002101422650001501443650002601458650002801484700002201512700002201534700002701556700002001583773009201603856008601695852000901781655001201790IND4465499320221119135725.0141111e20121215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446549932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2012.07.0632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodríguez-Sánchez, R.10aPhycobiliproteins or C-phycocyanin of Arthrospira (Spirulina) maxima protect against HgCl₂-caused oxidative stress and renal damage  ap. 2359-2365.  aOur objective was to determine if the phycobiliproteins of Arthrospira (Spirulina) maxima protect renal cells against mercury-caused oxidative stress and cellular damage in the kidney.

The left kidneys were used to determine lipid peroxidation, quantification of reactive oxygen species, and reduced glutathione and oxidised content. The right kidneys were processed for histology.

Structural analyses confirm that metacarbonates record several stages of deformation: D1, D2 ductile phases related to Caledonian metamorphism and a D3 brittle phase related to Late Cretaceous–Paleogene evolution of the West Spitsbergen Fold Belt. The latter is represented by thrust faults, localized folds with strain slip cleavages and late extensional collapse. Petrographic investigations reveal that Caledonian greenschist facies metamorphism was characterized by the high activity of H2O-CO2-rich fluids which promoted extensive recrystallization and within-rock spatial reorganization of sampled metacarbonates. Microscopic, SEM and microprobe analyses exclude the existence of any primary pre-metamorphic ferromagnetic minerals (primary-related to sedimentation and or early diagenesis) and point to metamorphic 4C superstructure (Fe7S8) pyrrhotite as the main ferromagnetic carrier in investigated rocks. This is confirmed by the three-component isothermal remanent magnetization (IRM) procedures and the results of thermal demagnetizations. In 12 sites a total number of 72 independently oriented palaeomagnetic samples were collected from which 181 specimens were drilled and thermally demagnetized. Sampled metacarbonates are weakly magnetized (NRM <0.2mA/m). The statistically significant palaeomagnetic results were achieved only from 1 of 12 investigated sites. In one site situated in the Western overturned limb of the Holmesletfjellet Syncline intermediate unblocking temperatures – “pyrrhotite related” component WTSJ5M superimposed on the S1 Caledonian schistosity was recognized (D = 100.7°, I = -21.4° α95% = 5.5°, k = 58.23). Coincidence of WTSJ5M with Silurian–Devonian sector of the Baltica reference path after unfolding of the syncline by the angle of 130° suggests synfolding origin of this direction. Further, this suggests that Holmesletfjellet Syncline originated as an open fold and has been transformed into an overturned syncline during the Late Caledonian shortening or in the Late Cretaceous–Palaeogene time.  aPublisher supplied data 0aArctic 0aSpitsbergen 0aCaledonides 0aWest Spitsbergen Fold Belt 0apalaeomagnetism 0apetrography 0ametacarbonates 0ametamorphic pyrrhotite 0aferromagnetic carriers1 aNejbert , Krzysztof1 aDomańska−Siuda , Justyna1 aManby , Geoffrey0 tPolish Polar Research.g2014 Dec. 10, v. 35, no. 4 p.553-592dDe Gruyter Openx2081-82627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/popore-2014-00313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02154naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002000154245010700174300001600281520116900297592002801466653002001494653000801514653001901522700002001541700002701561700002101588700002401609773012201633856008801755852000901843655001201852IND60520381420221119131408.0160520e20140129xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052038142DNAL7 a10.3889/mjms.1857-5773.2013.03052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEzzat, Wafaa M.10aValidity of Autotaxin as a Novel Diagnostic Marker for Liver Fibrosis in Egyptian Chronic HCV Patients  ap. 359-364.  aWe aimed to detect the validity of serum ATX as a diagnostic marker for liver fibrosis. Forty-eight males and 16 females were enrolled in the current study. Their ages ranged from 29-57 years with mean of 45.09, all were chronically HCV infected. Laboratory assessment was done for all subjects in form of complete blood picture; liver function test; lipid profile and serum detection of ATX. Patients were grouped according to the stage of fibrosis into group 1: fibrosis score 0, 1, 2, 3; group 2: fibrosis score: 4, 5, 6.The mean values of ATX in all studied patients with chronic HCV infection was 63.02 ± 36.29 while that of healthy controls was 65.31 ± 12.24 without any significant difference. Surprisingly, mean values of ATX were higher among patients with group 1 but it did not reach the significant level. In each group of them, the differences between mean values of ATX among different grades of liver fibrosis were insignificant. It was also noticed that the mean values of ATX were higher among men than in women .It was concluded that Autotoxin might not be used as a useful diagnostic marker for liver fibrosis in Egyptian chronic HCV patients.  aPublisher supplied data 0aAutotoxin (ATX) 0aHCV 0aliver fibrosis1 aRagab, Halla M.1 aEl Maksoud, Nabila Abd1 aAbdulla, Nour A.1 aElhosary, Yasser A.0 tMacedonian journal of medical sciences.g2014 Jan. 29, v. 6, no. 4 p.359-364dVersitawJournal:23186x1857-57497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3889/mjms.1857-5773.2013.03053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03878naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142100003800160245013500198300001600333520180900349592002802158650001102186650001602197650001802213650003002231650001502261650001402276650001202290650001902302650002002321650002402341650002302365650006502388650004702453650001202500650001102512650001402523650002402537650004702561650001102608650005302619650002602672650005002698650005402748650003202802650002902834650002002863650003802883650004502921700002302966700003202989700002103021700002103042773011103063856008103174852000903255655001203264IND4471269420221119113003.0120501e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447126942DNAL7 a222985732pmid7 a10.3945/jn.111.1525952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAppuhamy, J.

The objective of this study was to examine the effects of individual essential AA (EAA) on cellular signaling and fractional protein synthesis rates (FSR) in bovine mammary cells. Omission of L-arginine, L-isoleucine, L-leucine, or all EAA reduced (P < 0.05) mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR; Ser2448) and ribosomal protein S6 (rpS6; Ser235/236) phosphorylation in MAC-T cells. Phosphorylation of mTOR and rpS6 kinase 1 (S6K1; Thr389) decreased (P < 0.05) in the absence of L-isoleucine, L-leucine, or all EAA in lactogenic mammary tissue slices. Omission of L-tryptophan also reduced S6K1 phosphorylation (P = 0.01). Supplementation of L-leucine to media depleted of EAA increased mTOR and rpS6 and decreased eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (Thr56) phosphorylation (P < 0.05) in MAC-T cells. Supplementation of L-isoleucine increased mTOR, S6K1, and rpS6 phosphorylation (P < 0.05). No single EAA considerably affected eukaryotic initiation factor 2-α (eIF2α; Ser51) phosphorylation, but phosphorylation was reduced in response to provision of all EAA (P < 0.04). FSR declined when L-isoleucine (P = 0.01), L-leucine (P = 0.01), L-methionine (P = 0.02), or L-threonine (P = 0.07) was depleted in media and was positively correlated (R = 0.64, P < 0.01) with phosphorylation of mTOR and negatively correlated (R = –0.42, P = 0.01) with phosphorylation of eIF2α. Such regulation of protein synthesis will result in variable efficiency of transfer of absorbed EAA to milk protein and is incompatible with the assumption that a single nutrient limits protein synthesis that is encoded in current diet formulation strategies.  aPublisher supplied data 3acattle 3acorrelation 3adairy protein 3afractional synthesis rate 3aisoleucine 3alactation 3aleucine 3amilk synthesis 3aphosphorylation 3aprotein requirement 3aribosomal proteins 2aAmino Acids, Essentialxadministration & dosagexdeficiency. 2aAnimal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aCell Line 2aDietary Supplements 2aEukaryotic Initiation Factor-2xmetabolism 2aFemale 2aIsoleucinexadministration & dosagexdeficiency. 2aLactationxmetabolism 2aLeucinexadministration & dosagexdeficiency. 2aMammary Glands, Animalxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aMilk Proteinsxbiosynthesis 2aNutritional Requirements 2aPhosphorylation 2aSignal Transductionxdrug effects 2aTOR Serine-Threonine Kinasesxmetabolism1 aKnoebel, Nicole A.1 aNayananjalie, W.

The distribution of bacterial species is driven by environmental selection through abiotic and biotic factors as well dispersal limitations. We asked whether interference competition, a biotic factor, could explain variability in habitat use by Pseudomonas species in the human home. To answer this question, we screened almost 8000 directional, pairwise interactions between 89 Pseudomonas strains including members of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 29), Pseudomonas fluorescens (n = 21), and Pseudomonas putida (n = 39) species groups for the presence of killing. This diverse set of Pseudomonas strains includes those isolated from several different habitats within the home environment and includes combinations of strains that were isolated from different spatial scales. The use of this strain set not only allowed us to analyze the commonality and phylogenetic scale of interference competition within the genus Pseudomonas but also allowed us to investigate the influence of spatial scale on this trait. Overall, the probability of killing was found to decrease with increasing phylogenetic distance, making it unlikely that interference competition accounts for previously observed differential habitat use among Pseudomonas species and species groups. Strikingly, conspecific P. aeruginosa killing accounted for the vast majority of the observed killing, and this killing was found to differ across the habitat type and spatial scale of the strains’ isolation. These data suggest that interference competition likely plays a large role in the within-species dynamics of P. aeruginosa but not other household Pseudomonas species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aPseudomonas fluorescens 3aPseudomonas putida 3abiogeography 3abiotic factors 3ahabitat preferences 3ahabitats 3ahumans 3aphylogeny 3aprobability1 aRemold, Susanna K.0 tMicrobial ecology.g2016 Nov., v. 72, no. 4 p.821-830dSpringer USx0095-36287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00248-015-0652-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02761naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245014200161300001600303520125900319592002801578650000801606650003001614650002201644650002101666650001301687650001101700650001001711650001601721650001701737650001201754650001301766650001401779650001401793650003001807650003001837650000901867650001101876700001701887700002601904700001901930700002301949700002301972700001801995700002102013700002702034773010002061856007302161852000902234655001202243IND60137806820221117191040.0150524e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013780682DNAL7 a10.1111/pbi.122542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeyman, Philip D.10aInactivation of Phaeodactylum tricornutum urease gene using transcription activator‐like effector nuclease‐based targeted mutagenesis  ap. 460-470.  aDiatoms are unicellular photosynthetic algae with promise for green production of fuels and other chemicals. Recent genome‐editing techniques have greatly improved the potential of many eukaryotic genetic systems, including diatoms, to enable knowledge‐based studies and bioengineering. Using a new technique, transcription activator‐like effector nucleases (TALENs), the gene encoding the urease enzyme in the model diatom, Phaeodactylum tricornutum, was targeted for interruption. The knockout cassette was identified within the urease gene by PCR and Southern blot analyses of genomic DNA. The lack of urease protein was confirmed by Western blot analyses in mutant cell lines that were unable to grow on urea as the sole nitrogen source. Untargeted metabolomic analysis revealed a build‐up of urea, arginine and ornithine in the urease knockout lines. All three intermediate metabolites are upstream of the urease reaction within the urea cycle, suggesting a disruption of the cycle despite urea production. Numerous high carbon metabolites were enriched in the mutant, implying a breakdown of cellular C and N repartitioning. The presented method improves the molecular toolkit for diatoms and clarifies the role of urease in the urea cycle.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aPhaeodactylum tricornutum 3aSouthern blotting 3aWestern blotting 3aarginine 3acarbon 3agenes 3ametabolites 3ametabolomics 3amutants 3anitrogen 3anucleases 3aornithine 3apolymerase chain reaction 3asite-directed mutagenesis 3aurea 3aurease1 aBeeri, Karen1 aLefebvre, Stephane C.1 aRivera, Josefa1 aMcCarthy, James K.1 aHeuberger, Adam L.1 aPeers, Graham1 aAllen, Andrew E.1 aDupont, Christopher L.0 tPlant biotechnology journal.g2015 May, v. 13, no. 4 p.460-470dBlackwell Pub.x1467-76447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/pbi.122543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03370naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005500139245018700194300001600381500002000397520143500417592002801852596007201880596007201952596005902024596005402083596010802137650002702245650002502272650001802297650002002315650001802335650002002353650000902373650001702382650002302399650001402422650002002436650001602456650002502472650001602497700001602513700001202529700001402541700001502555700001902570700002302589700001302612773012102625856007302746852000902819655001202828IND60685961420221122215220.0200311e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068596142DNAL7 a10.1111/anu.129852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXia, Sudong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5252-533010aInfluence of dietary protein level on growth performance, digestibility and activity of immunity‐related enzymes of leopard coral grouper, Plectropomus leopardus (Lacépède, 1802)  ap. 242-247.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAn 8‐week feeding trial was conducted to assess the interaction between dietary protein levels and fish growth, digestibility and activity of immunity‐related enzymes of Plectropomus leopardus.

P. leopardus fed with 500 g/kg, 550 g/kg and 600 g/kg dietary protein, showed higher weight gain rates than fish fed 400 g/kg and 450 g/kg dietary protein. Ingestion rate in fish fed with 500 g/kg dietary protein was significantly higher than those with other diets. P. leopardus fed with 500 g/kg, 550 g/kg and 600 g/kg dietary protein, showed that feed coefficients were significantly lower than those fed with 400 g/kg and 450 g/kg dietary protein.

Protease activity was highest in fish fed on 500 g/kg dietary protein. Fish fed with 500 g/kg dietary protein, had the highest superoxide dismutase activity. Fish fed with 600 g/kg dietary protein, had the highest alkaline phosphatase activity. Thus, a diet containing 500 g/kg protein is recommended for P. leopardus aquaculture.  aPublisher supplied data  aITTFRS2017002cInnovation Team of Tianjin Fisheries Research System  aITTFRS2017004cInnovation Team of Tianjin Fisheries Research System  a41506192cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2018YFD0900400cNational Key R&D Program of China  a201601400cTianjin Agricultural Science and Technology Achievement Transformation and Promotion project 3aPlectropomus leopardus 3aalkaline phosphatase 3aanimal growth 3adietary protein 3adigestibility 3aenzyme activity 3afish 3afish culture 3agrowth performance 3aingestion 3aprotein content 3aproteinases 3asuperoxide dismutase 3aweight gain1 aSun, Jinhui1 aLi, Man1 aZhao, Wei1 aZhang, Dan1 aYou, Hongzheng1 aRajkumar, Mayalagu1 aWu, Biao0 tAquaculture nutrition.g2020 Apr., v. 26, no. 2 p.242-247dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl56078x1353-57737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/anu.129853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03712naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005200151245011100203520205400314592002802368650001702396650001702413650001702430650001402447650001002461650001102471650001302482650001402495650001702509650002102526651001002547653001702557653002302574653002402597653002102621653002202642653002302664700001302687700001702700700001902717700001402736700001702750700001402767700001802781700001202799700001402811700001802825700005602843700002202899700002102921773010902942856008603051852000903137655001203146IND60761046920221120072022.0220423e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076104692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.soilbio.2021.1085222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYin, Rui1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4580-131710aNitrogen deposition stimulates decomposition via changes in the structure and function of litter food webs  aNitrogen (N) deposition poses a threat to terrestrial biodiversity and ecosystem functioning globally. However, little is known concerning how the structure and function of litter fauna communities will respond in this context. Here, a gradient of N deposition (0, 20, and 40 kg N ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹) was simulated in a subtropical forest of southwestern China, to assess the potential effects of increased N deposition on the trophic structure and functioning of fauna communities in decomposing leaf litters of three main subtropical plant functional groups covering a total of 18 species: six evergreen broadleaf, six deciduous broadleaf, and six coniferous trees. We found that N addition shifted the trophic structure of fauna communities in decomposing litter, and different fauna feeding guilds showed distinct response patterns. Specifically, N addition increased the abundance of predators, decreased the abundance of omnivores, while detritivores were less affected. Compared to deciduous broadleaf and coniferous litters, evergreen broadleaf litter had less complex structure of fauna communities, but it decomposed slower. Further, structural equation modeling (SEM) showed that N addition increased litter decomposition in part via changing the trophic structure of fauna communities, with a positive correlation between predators and detritivores being associated with higher decomposition. As omnivores often exhibit top-down pressure on all other trophic guilds in (sub-)tropics, our observed shifts in trophic structure and litter decomposition might be partly due to the N addition-induced declines in omnivorous ant population. Future studies should investigate the role of bottom-up and top-down forces between detritivores, predators, and omnivores in driving litter decomposition. Collectively, our findings suggest that (i) N deposition consistently shifts the trophic structure of fauna communities across litter types, and (ii) such a shift further translate into changes in the functioning of subtropical forest ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiochemistry 3abiodiversity 3adetritivores 3aequations 3afauna 3aleaves 3anitrogen 3aomnivores 3asoil biology 3atropical forests 3aChina 0aBiodiversity 0aEcosystem function 0aFauna feeding guild 0aLitter mass loss 0aNitrogen addition 0aSubtropical forest1 aLiu, Qun1 aTian, Shanyi1 aPotapov, Anton1 aZhu, Biao1 aYang, Kaijun1 aLi, Zhiji1 aZhuang, Liyan1 aTan, Bo1 aZhang, Li1 aXu, Zhengfeng1 aKardol, Paul1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7065-34351 aSchädler, Martin1 aEisenhauer, Nico0 tSoil biology & biochemistry.g2022 Mar., v. 166 p.108522-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl124x0038-07177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2021.1085223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04095naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100005800188245011300246300001100359506007600370520236000446592002802806596007202834506003702906650002402943650001002967650002302977650001903000650003403019650001303053650001803066650002503084650001703109650001803126650002103144650001003165650001303175650002603188650002603214650002503240650002303265650003503288700002403323700001703347773012203364856008203486852000903568655001203577IND60574486720221207091255.0200605e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057448672DNAL7 a286664752pmid7 aPMC54929322pmcid7 a10.1186/s12711-017-0327-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBiemans, Floor1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0303-844812aA model to estimate effects of SNPs on host susceptibility and infectivity for an endemic infectious disease  ap. 53.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Infectious diseases in farm animals affect animal health, decrease animal welfare and can affect human health. Selection and breeding of host individuals with desirable traits regarding infectious diseases can help to fight disease transmission, which is affected by two types of (genetic) traits: host susceptibility and host infectivity. Quantitative genetic studies on infectious diseases generally connect an individual’s disease status to its own genotype, and therefore capture genetic effects on susceptibility only. However, they usually ignore variation in exposure to infectious herd mates, which may limit the accuracy of estimates of genetic effects on susceptibility. Moreover, genetic effects on infectivity will exist as well. Thus, to design optimal breeding strategies, it is essential that genetic effects on infectivity are quantified. Given the potential importance of genetic effects on infectivity, we set out to develop a model to estimate the effect of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on both host susceptibility and host infectivity. To evaluate the quality of the resulting SNP effect estimates, we simulated an endemic disease in 10 groups of 100 individuals, and recorded time-series data on individual disease status. We quantified bias and precision of the estimates for different sizes of SNP effects, and identified the optimum recording interval when the number of records is limited. RESULTS: We present a generalized linear mixed model to estimate the effect of SNPs on both host susceptibility and host infectivity. SNP effects were on average slightly underestimated, i.e. estimates were conservative. Estimates were less precise for infectivity than for susceptibility. Given our sample size, the power to estimate SNP effects for susceptibility was 100% for differences between genotypes of a factor 1.56 or more, and was higher than 60% for infectivity for differences between genotypes of a factor 4 or more. When disease status was recorded 11 times on each animal, the optimal recording interval was 25 to 50% of the average infectious period. CONCLUSIONS: Our model was able to estimate genetic effects on susceptibility and infectivity. In future genome-wide association studies, it may serve as a starting point to identify genes that affect disease transmission and disease prevalence.  aPublisher supplied data  a847.13.004cNederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3ainfectious diseases 3aherds 3adisease prevalence 3aanimal welfare 3agenome-wide association study 3abreeding 3aanimal health 3adisease transmission 3ahuman health 3apathogenicity 3aendemic diseases 3agenes 3agenotype 3afarmed animal species 3aquantitative genetics 3atime series analysis 3astatistical models 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism1 ade Jong, Mart C.

Since regeneration of bone tissue takes a long time, promoting osteogenesis of stem cells is desired for earlier recovery from dysfunctions caused by bone defects. Here, we combined endothelial cell co-culture using the molecularly mobile sulfonated polyrotaxane (PRX) surfaces to enhance the mineralization of human bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (HBMSCs). Sulfonated PRXs are composed of sulfopropyl ether-modified α-cyclodextrins (α-CDs) threaded on a polyethylene glycol chain. The molecular mobility of PRX, α-CDs moving along the polymer, can be modulated by the number of α-CDs. When osteoblastic differentiation was induced in HBMSCs and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), co-culture groups on sulfonated PRX surfaces with low molecular mobility showed the highest mineralization, which is about two times as high as co-culture groups on sulfonated PRX surfaces with high molecular mobility. Nuclear accumulation of yes-associated proteins in HBMSCs and cell–cell communication via cytokines or cadherin may play an important role in synergistically induced mineralization of HBMSCs.  aPublisher supplied data 3abone formation 3abone marrow 3acadherins 3acell communication 3acoculture 3acytokines 3ahumans 3amesenchymal stromal cells 3amineralization 3apolyethylene glycol 3arotaxanes1 aArisaka, Yoshinori1 aHakariya, Masahiro1 aIwata, Takanori1 aYoda, Tetsuya1 aYui, Nobuhiko0 tRSC advances.g2021 May 24, v. 11, no. 30 p.18685-18692dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1ra01296g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02127naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245010600164300001400270520126800284592002801552653001501580653001901595653002401614653001101638653001401649773009701663856008001760852000901840655001201849IND60520630420221121021009.0160522e20150325xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052063042DNAL7 a10.1515/popore-2015-00032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHara, Urszula10aBryozoan internal moulds from the La Meseta Formation (Eocene) of Seymour Island, Antarctic Peninsula  ap. 25-49.  aThe loose, small zooecia of the cheilostome bryozoans have been discovered in the lowermost part of the LaMeseta Formation on Seymour (Marambio) Island. They systemati− cally include the representatives of Beanidae Canu et Bassler, Catenicellidae Busk, Savi− gnyellidae Levinsen, and Calwelliidae MacGillivray.

A few branched segments composed of multiserial zooecia arranged back to back were tentatively incorporated into ?Malakosaria. Beania, marks the oldest fossil record, whereas representatives of Savignyelli− dae along with ditaxiporine catenicellid and ?Malakosaria are for the first time reported from Antarctica.

We hypothesised that invitro growth of cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) of these follicles in the presence of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and progesterone (P4) increase the levels of transcripts and have a positive impact on maturation. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of EGF and P4 on growth, maturation, and expression of mRNAs for growth and differentiation factor 9 (GDF9), cyclin B1, oocyte-specific linker histone (H1FOO), quinase cMOS, poly(A) ribonuclease (PARN), and initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) after growth and prematuration of COCs. Bovine COCs (n=400) were aspirated from antral follicles (1-3mm) and cultured for 48h in control medium (TCM-199 plus 5.0mgmL−1 LH, 0.5mgmL−1 FSH, and 5% fetal bovine serum) alone or with EGF (10ngmL−1), P4 (100 µM), or both EGF and P4. After growth, the COCs were pre-matured for 20h in TCM-199 containing 5.0mgmL−1 LH, 0.5mgmL−1 FSH, 0.4% bovine serum albumin, and 10μM cilostamide. Then, COCs were matured invitro in the same medium used for prematuration, but without cilostamide. Oocyte diameter and meiotic progression were evaluated after growth, prematuration, and maturation periods. After prematuration, oocytes were stored until RNA extraction. Total RNA was extracted using Trizol according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). After reverse transcription, quantification of mRNAs for GDF9, cyclin B1, H1FOO, cMOS, PARN, eIF4E, and GAPDH was performed by real-time PCR. The delta-delta-cycle threshold (ΔΔCT) method was used to normalise the data. The percentages of oocytes in each stage of maturation were compared by Mann-Whitney test. Differences in expression of mRNAs were analysed by Kruskal-Wallis test (P<0.05). The results showed that, compared with time 0, an increase in oocyte diameter was observed after 48h of culture for COCs in all groups (P<0.05), except for those cultured in control medium alone or with only P4. However, when compared with control medium, no effects of EGF, P4, or both were seen after the growth and prematuration periods. After prematuration, a higher percentages of oocytes at the germinal vesicle stage was observed for COCs cultured with P4 compared with those cultured in TCM-199 (P<0.05). After IVM, the rate of meiosis resumption was significantly reduced in oocytes cultured with P4 (P<0.05). The levels of mRNA for cMOS, H1FOO, and cyclin B1 in oocytes cultured with P4 were higher than those cultured in the control medium (P<0.05). The mRNA levels for eIF4E in oocytes cultured with both EGF and P4 were increased (P<0.05) compared with those cultured with EGF. The levels of transcripts for PARN in oocytes cultured with both EGF and P4 were higher than those in COCs cultured with only P4. In contrast, mRNA levels of GDF9 did not show differences between treatments.

The moisture content and water activity of the lyophilized samples treated by different concentrations of whey protein hydrolysate were ≤5.23 ± 0.33 g/100 g and ≤0.102 ± 0.003, respectively. During storage at 25°C and 30°C, whey protein hydrolysate had a stronger protective effect on B. lactis Probio-M8 than the same concentration of whey protein. Using the Excel tool GinaFit, we estimated the microbial inactivation kinetics during storage. Whey protein hydrolysate reduced cell damage caused by an increase in temperature. Whey protein hydrolysate could protect cells by increasing the osmotic pressure as a compatible solute. Whey protein hydrolysate improved cell membrane integrity and reduced the amounts of reactive oxygen species and malondialdehyde produced. The findings indicated that whey protein hydrolysate was a novel antioxidant lyoprotectant that could protect probiotics during freeze-drying and storage.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis 3acell membranes 3acell viability 3adairy science 3afreeze drying 3amalondialdehyde 3aosmotic pressure 3aprobiotics 3aprotective effect 3aprotein hydrolysates 3areactive oxygen species 3asolutes 3awater activity 3awater content 3awhey protein 0aBifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis Probio-M8 0awhey protein hydrolysate 0afreeze-drying 0aoxidative damage 0aviability1 aHuang, Tian1 aLiu, Kailong1 aYu, Jie1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6019-96461 aYao, Guoqiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0451-06251 aZhang, Wenyi1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5530-42101 aZhang, Heping1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6632-26411 aSun, Tiansong0 tJournal of dairy science.g2022 Sept., v. 105, no. 9 p.7308-7321dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2021-215463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03276naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002500164245010500189300001600294500001500310520137400325592002801699650001301727650002601740650001701766650002501783650002301808650002001831650002601851650002001877650001501897650002101912650001201933650001801945650001001963650002401973650005401997650003602051650001802087650003002105650003902135650003302174650002502207650002802232650002102260650003502281650002302316653002702339653002502366700002002391700001702411700002302428700002102451773010002472856008102572852000902653655001202662IND4480943320221120131536.0141111e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448094332DNAL7 a227137152pmid7 a10.1016/j.fgb.2012.06.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aButchko, Robert A.E.10aLae1 regulates expression of multiple secondary metabolite gene clusters in Fusarium verticillioides  ap. 602-612.  a2019-12-06  aThe filamentous fungus Fusarium verticillioides can cause disease of maize and is capable of producing fumonisins, a family of toxic secondary metabolites linked to esophageal cancer and neural tube defects in humans and lung edema in swine and leukoencephalomalacia in equines. The expression of fumonisin biosynthetic genes is influenced by broad-domain transcription factors (global regulators) and Fum21, a pathway-specific transcription factor. LaeA is a global regulator that in Aspergillus nidulans, affects the expression of multiple secondary metabolite gene clusters by modifying heterochromatin structure. Here, we employed gene deletion analysis to assess the effect of loss of a F. verticillioides laeA orthologue, LAE1, on genome-wide gene expression and secondary metabolite production. Loss of Lae1 resulted in reduced expression of gene clusters responsible for synthesis of the secondary metabolites bikaverin, fumonisins, fusaric acid and fusarins as well as two clusters for which the corresponding secondary metabolite is unknown. Analysis of secondary metabolites revealed that, in contrast to a previously described Fusarium fujikuroi lae1 mutant, bikaverin production is reduced. Fumonisin production is unchanged in the F. verticillioides lae1 mutant. Complementation of the F. verticillioides mutant resulted in increased fumonisin production.  aPublisher supplied data 3afusarins 3atranscription factors 3afusaric acid 3aAspergillus nidulans 3aFusarium fujikuroi 3agene expression 3asecondary metabolites 3aheterochromatin 3afumonisins 3amultigene family 3amutants 3agene deletion 3afungi 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aFungal Proteinsxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aFusariumxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGene Deletion 2aGene Expression Profiling 2aGene Expression Regulation, Fungal 2aGenetic Complementation Test 2aMetabolomexgenetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMultigene Family 2aPolyketide Synthasesxgenetics 2aSequence Alignment 0aAspergillus nidulellus 0aGibberella fujikuroi1 aBrown, Daren W.1 aBusman, Mark1 aTudzynski, Bettina1 aWiemann, Philipp0 tFungal genetics and biology.g2012 Aug., v. 49, no. 8 p.602-612dElsevier Inc.x1087-18457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fgb.2012.06.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02687naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100003300180245005100213300001600264506007600280520133200356592002801688506003701716650002501753650001701778650001601795650001001811650002201821650001001843650002401853650000901877650001901886650002801905650002401933650002101957650001701978650001201995700002102007700001902028773010002047856007302147852000902220655001202229IND60137807220221207103317.0150524e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013780722DNAL7 a10.1111/pbi.123562doi7 aPMC50549082pmcid7 a257566092pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNagahatenna, Dilrukshi S.

Over the past decades, extensive genetic and molecular analyses have provided valuable insights into the complex regulatory network of the tetrapyrrole biosynthesis. However, tetrapyrroles are also implicated in abiotic stress tolerance, although the mechanisms are largely unknown. With recent reports demonstrating that modified tetrapyrrole biosynthesis in plants confers wilting avoidance, a component physiological trait to drought tolerance, it is now timely that this pathway be reviewed in the context of drought stress signalling. In this review, the significance of tetrapyrrole biosynthesis under drought stress is addressed, with particular emphasis on the inter‐relationships with major stress signalling cascades driven by reactive oxygen species (ROS) and organellar retrograde signalling. We propose that unlike the chlorophyll branch, the heme branch of the pathway plays a key role in mediating intracellular drought stress signalling and stimulating ROS detoxification under drought stress. Determining how the tetrapyrrole biosynthetic pathway is involved in stress signalling provides an opportunity to identify gene targets for engineering drought‐tolerant crops.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abiochemical pathways 3abiosynthesis 3achlorophyll 3acrops 3adrought tolerance 3agenes 3agenetic engineering 3aheme 3aphotosynthesis 3areactive oxygen species 3asignal transduction 3astress tolerance 3awater stress 3awilting1 aLangridge, Peter1 aWhitford, Ryan0 tPlant biotechnology journal.g2015 May, v. 13, no. 4 p.447-459dBlackwell Pub.x1467-76447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/pbi.123563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02978naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001200139245008500151300001800236500002000254520154300274592002801817650002901845650002501874650001301899650002701912650001601939650001601955650002001971650002601991650002302017650002002040650001402060650001402074650001102088650001202099650001202111650002902123650002502152650001602177700001502193700001502208700001402223700001602237700001402253773012302267856007302390852000902463655001202472IND60587789820221118230326.0180102e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058778982DNAL7 a10.1111/anu.123502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJin, M.10aDietary arginine requirement of juvenile swimming crab, Portunus trituberculatus  ap. 1174-1184.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAn 8‐week feeding trial was conducted to determine the optimal dietary arginine requirement for juvenile swimming crab Portunus trituberculatus. Six isonitrogenous and isolipidic experimental diets were formulated to contain graded arginine levels which ranged from 15.9 to 33.0 g kg⁻¹. Each diet was randomly assigned to triplicate groups of 60 juvenile swimming crabs (4.72 ± 0.12 g). The results indicated that dietary arginine had significant effects on weight gain (WG), specific growth rate (SGR), protein productive value, feed efficiency and protein efficiency ratio. Weight gain and SGR significantly increased with the dietary arginine increasing from 15.9 to 27.4 g kg⁻¹, while with the further increasing from 27.4 to 33.0 g kg⁻¹, WG and SGR did not increase significantly. Maximum arginine, proline and total essential amino acid contents in muscle were observed in 27.4 g kg⁻¹ group diet. The swimming crab fed the diet with lower dietary arginine level showed higher AST and lower ALT in the serum. Crab fed with the lower dietary arginine level had significantly lower ALT in the serum than the other groups. Haemolymph indexes were significantly affected by the dietary arginine level except for the cholesterol concentration, and the highest values were all found in 27.4 g kg⁻¹ group diet. The two slope broken‐line model using SGR showed that the optimal dietary arginine requirement was 27.7 g kg⁻¹ of the dry matter (56.0 g kg⁻¹ dietary protein) for juvenile swimming crab.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPortunus trituberculatus 3aalanine transaminase 3aarginine 3aaspartate transaminase 3ablood serum 3acholesterol 3adietary protein 3aessential amino acids 3aexperimental diets 3afeed conversion 3ahemolymph 3ajuveniles 3amodels 3amuscles 3aproline 3aprotein efficiency ratio 3aspecific growth rate 3aweight gain1 aZhou, Q.C.1 aWang, M.Q.1 aHuo, Y.W.1 aHuang, W.W.1 aMai, K.S.0 tAquaculture nutrition.g2016 Dec., v. 22, no. 6 p.1174-1184dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl56078x1353-57737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/anu.123503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03866naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002300144245012300167300001800290506010400308506007600412520217500488592002802663506003702691650001302728650002102741650001002762650001802772650002002790650001902810650001202829650000902841650002602850650002102876650001802897650001002915653002202925653001902947653002202966653001102988700001902999700001403018700001803032700001803050700001803068700001903086773015503105856007903260852000903339655001203348IND60787302220221207050821.0220906e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078730222DNAL7 a10.3168/jds.2021-215902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSerrenho, R.

Cow-side tests using these fluids are available for rapid detection of elevated concentrations of ketone bodies. Although these tests have been extensively validated, the performance of different tests has not been compared over time. Our objectives were to investigate the relationship between point-of-care diagnostic tests measuring the concentrations of β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) in blood (BT; Precision Xtra, Abbott Laboratories), BHB in milk (MT; Keto-Test, Elanco), and acetoacetate (AcAc) in urine (UT; Ketostix, Bayer Corporation) through cases of ketosis. Holstein cows (n = 148) were screened daily for hyperketonemia (HYK; blood BHB ≥1.2 mmol/L) from 3 to 16 d in milk (DIM); moreover, milk and urine samples were collected concomitantly and tested for ketones (ketosis thresholds: 100 µmol/L milk BHB and 5 mg/dL urine AcAc). Of the animals screened (n = 148), 74% were diagnosed with HYK. When diagnosed with HYK, cows were treated with propylene glycol orally once daily for 5 d. After the day of diagnosis (d 0), hyperketonemic cows were retested with BT, MT, and UT for 3 d (d 1, 2, and 3). We assessed the diagnostic test performance and time to ketosis (survival analyses and Cox proportional hazards models) of MT and UT compared with BT. Considering all paired samples (before and after diagnosis of HYK), MT had 61% sensitivity and 91% specificity, whereas the UT had 77% sensitivity and 94% specificity compared with BT. The specificity of MT and UT increased from d 0 to d 1, decreased on d 2, and increased on d 3. The median time to diagnosis of ketosis in blood was 5 DIM (95% CI 5 to 7 DIM); moreover, MT and UT had 2 d greater median time to diagnosis of ketosis compared with the BT [7 DIM (6 to 11 d); and 7 DIM (6 to 13 d), respectively]. We concluded that the UT is a more sensitive predictor of blood BHB concentration than the MT. The UT and MT tests diagnosed ketotic cows approximately 2 d later than the BT. The possible consequences of delay in detection of ketosis in milk and urine should be investigated.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aHolstein 3aacetoacetic acid 3ablood 3adairy science 3aearly lactation 3ahyperketonemia 3aketosis 3amilk 3apoint-of-care systems 3apropylene glycol 3arapid methods 3aurine 0aketosis diagnosis 0ahyperketonemia 0atransition period 0ahealth1 aWilliamson, M.1 aBerke, O.1 aLeBlanc, S.J.1 aDeVries, T.J.1 aMcBride, B.W.1 aDuffield, T.F.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2022 Sept., v. 105, no. 9 p.7719-7727dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2021-215903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03229naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245022900157300002000386500001900406520186400425592002802289650004402317650001502361650001202376650001102388650001902399650001902418650001502437650001802452650003702470650001902507700002902526700001702555700002102572700003102593773012402624856007402748852000902822655001202831IND60739087320221117230313.0210526e20210524xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073908732DNAL7 a10.1039/d1ra01504d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmini, Kasra10aEvaluation of the dispersion of metakaolin–graphene oxide hybrid in water and cement pore solution: can metakaolin really improve the dispersion of graphene oxide in the calcium-rich environment of hydrating cement matrix?  ap. 18623-18636.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aGraphene oxide (GO) is a promising candidate for reinforcing cement composites due to its prominent mechanical properties and good dispersibility in water. However, the severe agglomeration of GO nanosheets in the Ca²⁺ ion loaded environment of a freshly mixed cement composite is the main obstacle against the mentioned goal. Recent studies, based on the SEM images, have shown that the incorporation of pozzolans can ameliorate the GO agglomeration in cement matrix. Considering the fact that, for identifying the GO dispersion in cement matrix, SEM characterization is not preferred due to the hydrated cement matrix complexity and presence of small dosages of GO, this research has investigated the potential of Metakaolin (MK) as a highly reactive pozzolan against GO agglomeration in the non-hydrated environment of simulated cement pore solution (SCPS) for different MK/GO weight ratios. Additionally, the interaction between MK and GO in water is evaluated through different characterization methods. Visual investigation and UV-vis spectroscopy revealed that there should be a probable interaction between MK particles and GO nanosheets in water which was interpreted by Lewis acid–base interaction and further examined by FTIR spectroscopy. Moreover, the zeta potential measurements indicated that the increase in MK/GO weight ratio could lead to higher adsorption of GO on the surface of MK particles which was confirmed by the particle size analysis. Almost all of the conducted experiments on the MK–GO hybrid in simulated cement pore solution showed that different dosages of MK particles were incapable of preventing GO agglomeration; thus, despite the proposed mechanisms in previous studies, MK cannot effectively restrict the unfavorable effects of Ca²⁺ ions on GO dispersion in SCPS and analogously in the hydrating cement matrix.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aadsorption 3acalcium 3acement 3adispersibility 3agraphene oxide 3ananosheets 3aparticle size 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 3azeta potential1 aSoleimani Amiri, Siavash1 aGhasemi, Ali1 aMirvalad, Sajjad1 aHabibnejad Korayem, Asghar0 tRSC advances.g2021 May 24, v. 11, no. 30 p.18623-18636dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1ra01504d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02642naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001500171245007000186300001800256520108000274592002801354650001501382650001201397650001501409650001201424650001201436650001201448650001501460650003001475650001501505650002601520650001801546650001101564650001001575650002301585650003801608650001701646650001201663650001901675650002201694700002501716700002201741700001801763700003401781700002401815700002101839700002601860700002501886773011301911856005502024852000902079655001202088IND4466366820221120141004.0120907e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446636682DNAL7 a227797502pmid7 a10.1111/j.1462-2920.2012.02821.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChan, Yuki10aHypolithic microbial communities: between a rock and a hard place  ap. 2272-2282.  aDrylands are the largest terrestrial biome on Earth and a ubiquitous feature is desert pavement terrain, comprising rocks embedded in the mineral soil surface. Quartz and other translucent rocks are common and microbial communities termed hypoliths develop as biofilms on their ventral surfaces. In extreme deserts these represent major concentrations of biomass, and are emerging as key to geobiological processes and soil stabilization. These highly specialized communities are dominated by cyanobacteria that support diverse heterotrophic assemblages. Here we identify global‐scale trends in the ecology of hypoliths that are strongly related to climate, particularly with regard to shifts in cyanobacterial assemblages. A synthesis of available data revealed a linear trend for colonization with regard to climate, and we suggest potential application for hypoliths as ‘biomarkers’ of aridity on a landscape scale. The potential to exploit the soil‐stabilizing properties of hypolithic colonization in environmental engineering on dryland soils is also discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarid lands 3abiofilm 3abiomarkers 3abiomass 3aclimate 3adeserts 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental engineering 3alandscapes 3amicrobial communities 3amineral soils 3aquartz 3arocks 3asoil stabilization 2aBacterial Physiological Phenomena 2aBiodiversity 2aBiomass 2aDesert Climate 2aSoil Microbiology1 aLacap, Donnabella C.1 aLau, Maggie C.

The dissolving solvents in the health functional food products and the internal standard selected were N,N-dimethylacetamide and heptane, respectively. The analysis conditions for headspace-gas chromatography/flame ionization detection (HS-GC/FID) and headspace-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (HS-GC/MS) were determined as 18 mL of headspace volume, 100°C of headspace oven temperature, and 30 min of equilibration time; a Durabond (DB)-624 column was selected for this analysis. To validate this method, which applies N,N-dimethylacetamide as a dissolving solvent, the limit of detection and limit of quantification (LOQ) values based on the HS-GC/FID and HS-GC/MS analyses results were found to be 0.10, 0.29 and 0.16, 0.47 mg/L, respectively. The recoveries and coefficient of variation (CV) obtained by HS-GC/MS were 96.39–119.86% and 0.04–1.25%, respectively, better than those obtained by HS-GC/FID. By applying the HS-GC/MS method, it was possible to analyze the content of the residual hexane in 60 different types of health functional food products.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3adetection limit 3aflame ionization 3afunctional foods 3aheadspace analysis 3aheptane 3ahexane 3amass spectrometry 3aovens 3asolvents 3atemperature1 aLee, Sang Hwa1 aKim, Beom-Tea1 aLee, Gunyoung1 aYun, Sang Soon1 aLim, Ho Soo1 aKim, Yŏng-suk,0 tFood science and biotechnology.g2017 Apr., v. 26, no. 2 p.363-368dThe Korean Society of Food Science and Technologyx1226-77087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10068-017-0049-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03390naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002500188245007600213300001600289506007600305520169500381592002802076506003702104650002202141650002002163650002102183650001302204650001902217650002102236650002002257650001102277650002602288650001302314650001702327650001002344650001102354650001502365650001402380650001402394650001402408650001702422650001402439650001602453650000902469650001302478650001402491650001502505650001302520650001402533650002102547650001002568650002002578773008802598856008102686852000902767655001202776IND60556227420221207083527.0161031e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055622742DNAL7 a10.1007/s00248-015-0720-62doi7 aPMC50803212pmcid7 a267485002pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDrzewiecka, Dominika10aSignificance and Roles of Proteus spp. Bacteria in Natural Environments  ap. 741-758.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aProteus spp. bacteria were first described in 1885 by Gustav Hauser, who had revealed their feature of intensive swarming growth. Currently, the genus is divided into Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Proteus penneri, Proteus hauseri, and three unnamed genomospecies 4, 5, and 6 and consists of 80 O-antigenic serogroups. The bacteria are known to be human opportunistic pathogens, isolated from urine, wounds, and other clinical sources. It is postulated that intestines are a reservoir of these proteolytic organisms. Many wild and domestic animals may be hosts of Proteus spp. bacteria, which are commonly known to play a role of parasites or commensals. However, interesting examples of their symbiotic relationships with higher organisms have also been described. Proteus spp. bacteria present in soil or water habitats are often regarded as indicators of fecal pollution, posing a threat of poisoning when the contaminated water or seafood is consumed. The health risk may also be connected with drug-resistant strains sourcing from intestines. Positive aspects of the bacteria presence in water and soil are connected with exceptional features displayed by autochthonic Proteus spp. strains detected in these environments. These rods acquire various metabolic abilities allowing their adaptation to different environmental conditions, such as high concentrations of heavy metals or toxic substances, which may be exploited as sources of energy and nutrition by the bacteria. The Proteus spp. abilities to tolerate or utilize polluting compounds as well as promote plant growth provide a possibility of employing these microorganisms in bioremediation and environmental protection.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aProteus mirabilis 3aProteus penneri 3aProteus vulgaris 3abacteria 3abioremediation 3adomestic animals 3adrug resistance 3aenergy 3aenvironmental factors 3ahabitats 3aheavy metals 3ahosts 3ahumans 3aintestines 3anutrition 3aparasites 3apathogens 3aplant growth 3apoisoning 3aproteolysis 3arisk 3aseafoods 3aserotypes 3asoil water 3aswarming 3asymbiosis 3atoxic substances 3aurine 3awater pollution0 tMicrobial ecology.g2016 Nov., v. 72, no. 4 p.741-758dSpringer USx0095-36287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00248-015-0720-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02887naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006100151245010700212520137000319592002801689650001901717650001801736650001401754650002401768650001901792650001201811650002401823650001801847650001501865650002201880650001701902651001101919651001801930653003001948653003901978653001802017653002102035653002902056653002602085653002002111700001802131700002302149700002902172773010902201856008602310852000902396655001202405IND60761047320221123033104.0220118e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076104732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.soilbio.2021.1085312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBenoist, Apolline1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6350-006X10aEvaluation of biological nitrogen fixation in coarse woody debris from Eastern Canadian boreal forests  aThe contribution of Coarse Woody Debris (CWD) to N inputs in boreal ecosystems has been reported in intensively managed Scandinavian forests in Europe and in Pacific coastal rainforest in North America. These estimates range from 0.085 to 2 kg N ha⁻¹ y⁻¹. Data from Eastern Canadian forests that receive fewer sylvicultural treatments than do Scandinavian forests and are exposed to a drier climate than the Canadian rainforest are scare. We evaluated contributions of CWD to total BNF in two forest sites dominated by balsam fir and black spruce. We also measured the conversion ratio (R ratio = ARA/N₂) for the acetylene reduction assay, which is the method most often used to estimate N₂-fixation, using parallel ¹⁵N₂ incubations to account for potential methodological biases. We further tested two factors that can affect the R ratio, hance quality of BNF estimates in deadwood; inhibition of N₂-fixing methanotrophs by acetylene and molybdenum limitation of N₂-fixation. We report that N₂-fixation by CWD in balsam fir and black spruce from eastern boreal forest is low (0.05–0.12 kg N ha⁻¹y⁻¹) compared to other estimates for coniferous forests. We also show that moss-covered CWD can significantly contribute to CWD N₂-fixation and that improper validation of the ARA can lead to significant underestimation of N inputs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAbies balsamea 3aPicea mariana 3aacetylene 3aacetylene reduction 3aboreal forests 3aclimate 3acoarse woody debris 3amethanotrophs 3amolybdenum 3anitrogen fixation 3arain forests 3aEurope 3aNorth America 0aCoarse woody debris (CWD) 0aBiological nitrogen fixation (BNF) 0aBoreal forest 0aMoss-covered CWD 0aMethanotrophic N2-fixers 0aMolybdenum limitation 0aUnderground CWD1 aHoule, Daniel1 aBradley, Robert L.1 aBellenger, Jean-Philippe0 tSoil biology & biochemistry.g2022 Feb., v. 165 p.108531-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl124x0038-07177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2021.1085313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03464naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128072000900146100001500155245010500170300001600275500002400291520199900315650002602314650002002340650001002360650001302370650002002383650002502403650002202428650001902450650002702469650001802496650002002514653002402534653002202558700001902580700001702599700001802616773011702634852000902751856007702760856008602837930003302923945002502956946001302981655001202994IND4381523220221119021354.0060628e200604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438152322DNAL7 a10.1603/0046-225X-35.2.5162doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF8511 aNansen, C.10aSpatial Analysis of Pheromone-Baited Trap Captures from Controlled Releases of Male Indianmeal Moths  ap. 516-523.  aIncludes references  aEarly detection and precision targeting are key elements in a successful management strategy of stored product pests so that actions can be implemented while the population density is still low and controllable. The overall purpose of pheromone trapping is not to catch as many insect pests as possible, but to obtain monitoring data that provide as much information as possible about the spatio-temporal dynamics of the pest population. We placed 30 pheromone-baited traps in a grid with traps being 3-4 m apart in a relatively small trapping space with (1) no food, (2) no human activity, (3) all traps placed at the same height, and (4) no presence of Plodia interpunctella females (except when used as lures). Male moths were released from single locations, and the purposes of this study were to (1) evaluate the trapping efficiency (number of male P. interpunctella caught) when using different (Z,E)-9,12-tetradecadienyl acetate (Z9,E12-14:Oac) (ZETA) concentrations in lures, (2) release male P. interpunctella individuals from single locations and determine the relationship between pheromone-baited trap captures and distance from the release site, and (3) describe the spatial distribution pattern of pheromone-baited trap captures. The main conclusions were that (1) total trap captures of male P. interpunctella individuals were similar when deploying ZETA concentrations in lures ranging from 1 to 2,000 μg, (2) there was a significant exponential negative relationship between trap captures and distance from release sites when using live P. interpunctella females, 50 μg, or 500 μg as attractants, (3) the location of trap capture centroids was similar for trials with random and aggregated spatial distributions, (4) independently of pheromone concentration, most trap capture centroids were located within 3 m from the release site, and (5) even in a highly simplified environment, there was considerable difference in the spatial trends from three different release sites. 3aPlodia interpunctella 3astorage insects 3amales 3atrapping 3apheromone traps 3aspatial distribution 3aspatial variation 3asex pheromones 3achemical concentration 3adose response 3apest monitoring 0atrapping efficiency 0atrapping distance1 aPhillips, T.W.1 aMorton, P.K.1 aBonjour, E.L.0 tEnvironmental entomology.g2006 Apr., v. 35, no. 2 p.516-523dEntomological Society of America.x0046-225X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.entsoc.org/pubs/periodicals/ee/index.htm3electronic resource40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603/0046-225X-35.2.5163Available from publisher's Web site  a20060825b20060906c00000000  aINDdNZMe2006/08/24  aOther US 7aarticle03686naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002100153245013300174300001800307520197600325592002802301650002302329650002502352650001302377650001802390650002202408650001102430650001802441650001102459650001702470650001402487650002402501650003702525650001002562650001502572650001102587650002202598650001302620650002002633650001802653650001602671651001202687653002602699653001402725653001902739653002302758653002602781653002402807700002402831700001902855700001602874773012102890856008803011852000903099655001203108IND60609858620221120025932.0201125e20181115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060985862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.06.1632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDibike, Yonas B.10aModelling the potential effects of Oil-Sands tailings pond breach on the water and sediment quality of the Lower Athabasca River  ap. 1263-1281.  aWithin the Oil-Sands industry in Alberta, Canada, tailings ponds are used as water recycling and tailings storage facilities (TSF) for mining activities. However, there could be possible circumstances under which a sudden breach of an embankment confining one of the TSFs may occur. Such a tailings pond breach would result in a sudden release of a huge volume of Oil Sands process-affected water (OSPW) and sediment slurry containing substantial amount of chemical constituents that would follow the downstream drainage paths and subsequently enter into the Lower Athabasca River (LAR). This study investigates the implications of OS tailings release on the water and sediment quality of the LAR by simulating the fate of sediment and associated chemicals corresponding to a hypothetical breach and release scenarios from a select set of tailings ponds using a two-dimensional hydrodynamic and constituent transport model. After predicting the total volume, time evolution and concentration of sediment and associated chemicals (metals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and naphthenic acids (NAs)) reaching the LAR, the transport and deposition of these materials within the study reach is simulated. The results show that, depending on tailings release locations, between 40 and 70% of the sediment and associated chemicals get deposited onto the river bed of the 160 km study reach while the rest leaves the study domain during the first three days following the release event. These sediment/chemicals deposited during the initial spill may also have long-term effects on the water quality and aquatic ecosystem of the river and the downstream delta. However, care has to be taken in interpreting the results as further analysis has shown that the outcomes of such model simulations are very sensitive to the various underlying assumptions as well as the values assigned to some model parameters representing the physical properties of the tailings material.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquatic ecosystems 3achemical composition 3adrainage 3ahydrodynamics 3along term effects 3ametals 3amine tailings 3amining 3anaphthenates 3aoil sands 3aphysical properties 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3aponds 3aprediction 3arivers 3asimulation models 3aslurries 3astream channels 3awater quality 3awater reuse 3aAlberta 0aLower Athabasca River 0aOil Sands 0aTailings ponds 0aSediment transport 0aChemical constituents 0aTransport modelling1 aShakibaeinia, Ahmad1 aDroppo, Ian G.1 aCaron, Emma0 tScience of the total environment.g2018 Nov. 15, v. 642 p.1263-1281dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.06.1633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03170naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001500139245013200154300001600286520157800302592002801880650002101908650002701929650001701956650001801973650000901991650002202000650001202022650002202034650002402056650001002080650002202090650001102112650001802123650001702141650000902158650001002167650001302177650001602190650001902206650002102225650002902246650002602275650002202301650001402323650001702337700001702354700001802371700001602389700001702405773010002422856007302522852000902595655001202604IND60137807520221117191127.0150524e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013780752DNAL7 a10.1111/pbi.122702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Miao10aOverexpression of a NF‐YC transcription factor from bermudagrass confers tolerance to drought and salinity in transgenic rice  ap. 482-491.  aNuclear factor Y (NF‐Y) is a ubiquitous transcription factor formed by three distinct subunits, namely NF‐YA, NF‐YB and NF‐YC. A stress‐responsive cDNA of NF‐YC (Cdt‐NF‐YC1) was isolated from triploid bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon × Cynodon transvaalensis), and its role in abiotic stress tolerance was investigated in this study. Cdt‐NF‐YC1 transcript was detected in all vegetative tissues with higher levels being observed in roots. Transcription of Cdt‐NF‐YC1 in leaves was induced by dehydration, salinity, and treatments with abscisic acid (ABA), hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) or nitric oxide (NO), but not altered by cold. The dehydration‐ or salt‐induced transcription of Cdt‐NF‐YC1 was blocked by inhibitor of ABA synthesis and scavenger of H₂O₂or NO, indicating that ABA, H₂O₂and NO were involved in the dehydration‐ and salt‐induced transcription of Cdt‐NF‐YC1. Overexpression of Cdt‐NF‐YC1 resulted in elevated tolerance to drought and salt stress and increased sensitivity to ABA in transgenic rice. Transcript levels of stress/ABA responsive genes (OsLEA3, OsRAB16A, OsLIP9 and OsP5CS1), ABA synthesis and signalling genes (OsNCED3 and OsABI2), and ABA‐independent genes (OsDREB1A, OsDREB1B and OsDREB2A) were substantially higher in transgenic rice than in wild‐type plants. The results suggested that that Cdt‐NF‐YC1 is a good candidate gene to increase drought and salinity tolerance in transgenic rice through modulating gene regulation in both ABA‐dependent and ABA‐independent pathways.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCynodon dactylon 3aCynodon transvaalensis 3aOryza sativa 3aabscisic acid 3acold 3acomplementary DNA 3adrought 3adrought tolerance 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aleaves 3amessenger RNA 3anitric oxide 3arice 3aroots 3asalinity 3asalt stress 3asalt tolerance 3astress tolerance 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 3atransgenic plants 3atriploidy 3awater stress1 aZhao, Yujuan1 aZhuo, Chunliu1 aLu, Shaoyun1 aGuo, Zhenfei0 tPlant biotechnology journal.g2015 May, v. 13, no. 4 p.482-491dBlackwell Pub.x1467-76447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/pbi.122703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04338naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002200142245008900164300001200253520302300265592002803288650001303316650002503329650001503354650001003369650002203379650002403401650001403425650001803439650001703457650001803474650001103492650001903503650001103522650001203533650001603545650001303561650001103574700001803585700001403603700001803617700001903635773012903654856007603783852000903859655001203868IND60677617520221120121725.0191202s2020    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067761752DNAL7 a10.1071/RDv32n2Ab1882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStoecklein, K. S.10a188 Improvement of bovine oocyte maturation invitro through cytokine supplementation  ap. 222.  aOocyte competence is one of the key factors determining the proportion of embryos that develop to the blastocyst stage. There is vast evidence that IVM oocytes exhibit less developmental potential than their invivo counterparts. Here, we tested whether supplementation of three cytokines [FGF2 (40 ngmL−1), LIF (20ngmL−1), and IGF1 (20 ngmL−1), termed FLI] improved oocyte maturation, and as a consequence, preimplantation development of bovine embryos invitro. In the first experiment, cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) were collected from abattoir-derived ovaries and placed in maturation medium,±FLI, for 18 to 22h. At the end of maturation, COCs were fertilized with sperm from a single Holstein bull known to have high fertility. After an 18- to 20-h fertilization period, putative zygotes were cultured in synthetic oviductal fluid for 8 days. The number of embryos that underwent at least one cellular division (cleavage) and the number of embryos that developed to the blastocyst stage was recorded on Days 3 and 8 after insemination, respectively. The COCs supplemented with FLI (n=554) and controls (n=534) were evaluated across 5 replicates. There was no difference in the cleavage rate (P>0.05) between the two treatments. Development to the blastocyst stage was higher (P=0.05) for FLI-treated COCs (34.9%±1.96) than for the control group (23.9%±1.96). In a second experiment, COCs (n=204) supplemented±FLI were collected and fixed at 6, 12, 18, and 24h after placement in maturation medium. The number of transzonal projections in the COCs was determined by localization of actin filaments by using confocal microscopy. Data were analysed by ANOVA using the GLM procedure of SAS software (version 9.4; SAS Institute Inc.). The model included treatment, time, and the interaction of treatment×time as fixed effects. There was no difference (P>0.05) in the number of transzonal projections at 6h (166.3±8.6 vs. 143.9±8.8) and 12h (107.8±8.4 vs. 128.3±7.7) between FLI-treated and control COCs. However, FLI-treated COCs had fewer (P<0.05) transzonal projections at 18h (67.9±7.8 vs. 100.1±7.7) and 24h (56.4±7.2 vs. 80.6±7.4) compared with the controls. There was a significant treatment×time interaction (P=0.006). In a third experiment, we tested whether the timing of transzonal projection disassociation affected lipid accumulation in the embryo. Blastocysts (n=59) on Day 8 produced from COCs matured±FLI were collected and lipid content was determined by using Nile Red staining. There was no difference (P>0.05) in lipid content between treatments. Thus, supplementation of maturation medium with FLI accelerates the disassociation of transzonal projections in COCs and improves subsequent embryonic development to the blastocyst stage while having no detectable effect on lipid content. Further research is necessary to understand how these cytokines modulate IVM of bovine oocytes.

METHODS: We present two algorithms. The first selects focal individuals that collectively represent the maximum possible portion of the haplotype diversity in the population. The second allocates a fixed sequencing budget among the families of focal individuals to enable phasing of their haplotypes at the sequence level. We tested the performance of the two algorithms in simulated pedigrees. For each pedigree, we evaluated the proportion of population haplotypes that are carried by the focal individuals and compared our results to a variant of the widely-used key ancestors approach and to two haplotype-based approaches. We calculated the expected phasing accuracy of the haplotypes of a focal individual at the sequence level given the proportion of the fixed sequencing budget allocated to its family. RESULTS: AlphaSeqOpt maximises the ability to capture and phase the most frequent haplotypes in a population in three ways. First, it selects focal individuals that collectively represent a larger portion of the population haplotype diversity than existing methods. Second, it selects focal individuals from across the pedigree whose haplotypes can be easily phased using family-based phasing and imputation algorithms, thus maximises the ability to impute sequence into the rest of the population. Third, it allocates more of the fixed sequencing budget to focal individuals whose haplotypes are more frequent in the population than to focal individuals whose haplotypes are less frequent. Unlike existing methods, we additionally present an algorithm to allocate part of the sequencing budget to the families (i.e. immediate ancestors) of focal individuals to ensure that their haplotypes can be phased at the sequence level, which is essential for enabling and maximising subsequent sequence imputation. CONCLUSIONS: We present a new method for the allocation of a fixed sequencing budget to focal individuals and their families such that the final sequenced haplotypes, when phased at the sequence level, represent the maximum possible portion of the haplotype diversity in the population that can be sequenced and phased at that budget.  aPublisher supplied data  aBB/J004235/1cBiotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (GB)  aBB/M009254/1cBiotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (GB)  aBB/L020726/1cBiotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (GB)  aBB/N004736/1cBiotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (GB)  aBB/L020467/1cBiotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (GB)  aBB/N006178/1cBiotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (GB)  aBB/N004728/1cBiotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (GB)  aMR/M000370/1cMedical Research Council (GB)0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aalgorithms 3agenotyping 3ahaplotypes 3alivestock 3apedigree1 aRos-Freixedes, Roger1 aBattagin, Mara1 aGorjanc, Gregor1 aHickey, John M.0 tGenetics, selection, evolution.g2017 Dec., v. 49, no. 1 p.47-47dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4350896x1297-96867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12711-017-0322-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02709naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245015500162300001800317520138700335592002801722650002101750650001801771650002501789650001701814650001101831650002501842650001401867650001001881650003601891650002201927650001301949650002901962700002101991700001202012700001502024700001802039700002002057773012002077856008102197852000902278655001202287IND60556227620221121071628.0161031e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055622762DNAL7 a10.1007/s00438-016-1247-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Wei10aTranscriptional profiling of genes involved in ascorbic acid biosynthesis, recycling, and degradation during three leaf developmental stages in celery  ap. 2131-2143.  aAscorbic acid (AsA) is an important nutrient in the human body and performs various healthy functions. With considerable medicinal properties, celery (Apium graveolens L.) could be a good source of AsA for human health. However, the biosynthetic, recycling, and degradation pathways of AsA in celery have yet to be characterized. To study the metabolic pathways involved in AsA, the genes involved in AsA biosynthesis, recycling, and degradation were isolated from celery, and their expression profiles and AsA levels were analyzed in the leaf blades and petioles of two celery varieties at three different growth stages. AsA levels were higher in ‘Ventura’ compared with ‘Liuhehuangxinqin’ in both tissues possibly because of different transcription levels of genes, such as L-galactose dehydrogenase (GalDH), L-galactono-1,4-lactone dehydrogenase (GalLDH), and glutathione reductase (GR). Results revealed that the D-mannose/L-galactose pathway may be the predominant pathway in celery, and the D-galacturonic acid pathway appeared to contribute largely to AsA accumulation in petioles than in leaf blades in ‘Liuhehuangxinqin.’ AsA contents are regulated by complex regulatory mechanisms and vary at different growth stages, tissues, and varieties in celery. The results provide novel insights into AsA metabolic pathways in leaf during celery growth and development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aApium graveolens 3aascorbic acid 3abiochemical pathways 3abiosynthesis 3acelery 3adevelopmental stages 3agalactose 3agenes 3aglutathione-disulfide reductase 3ametabolic studies 3apetioles 3atranscription (genetics)1 aWang, Guang-Long1 aLi, Hui1 aWang, Feng1 aXu, Zhi-Sheng1 aXiong, Ai-Sheng0 tMolecular genetics and genomics.g2016 Dec., v. 291, no. 6 p.2131-2143dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1617-46157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00438-016-1247-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02033naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001800166245009300184300001800277520070100295592002800996650002101024650002601045650001701071650001401088650001801102650001301120650001301133650002501146650002301171650002701194650001301221650003701234650002101271650003301292700001801325700001901343700001801362700001901380773013101399856004801530852000901578655001201587IND50058861620221119112842.0121011e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5005886162DNAL7 a229653352pmid7 a10.1007/s00128-012-0823-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMalhat, Farag10aResidue and Dissipation Dynamics of Lufenuron in Tomato Fruit Using QuEChERS Methodology  ap. 1037-1039.  aOne field experiment was conducted with lufenuron (Match® 5 % EC) on tomato crop during August 2011. The main objective was to understand the residue and dissipation behavior of insecticide lufenuron in tomato fruit samples. The dissipation behavior of lufenuron insecticide followed first-order rate kinetics at standard recommended dose application. The average initial deposit of lufenuron in tomato was observed to be 1.299 mg kg−1at single application rate. This lufenuron residue dissipated to bellow LOQ of 0.03 mg kg−1 21 days after the treatment. Lufenuron residues were lost with pre-harvest intervals of 7 days, following application at the recommended dose by manufacture.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapplication rate 3afield experimentation 3ainsecticides 3alufenuron 3amanufacturing 3asampling 3atomatoes 2aBenzamidesxanalysis 2aFood Contamination 2aInsecticidesxanalysis 2aKinetics 2aSolanum lycopersicumxchemistry. 2aModels, Chemical 2aPesticide Residuesxanalysis1 aAlmaz, Moniur1 aArief, Mohamed1 aEl-Din, Kamal1 aFathy, Mohamed0 tBulletin of environmental contamination and toxicology.g2012 Nov., v. 89, no. 5 p.1037-1039dSpringer-Verlagx0007-48617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00128-012-0823-4  aDNAL 7aarticle03478naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005000144245011900194300001800313506010400331506007600435520184900511592002802360506003702388650001302425650000902438650001402447650001002461650001402471650002002485650001802505650001502523650002302538650001302561653002002574653001502594653001302609700005602622700005402678700005702732773015502789856007902944852000903023655001203032IND60787302620221207072411.0220906e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078730262DNAL7 a10.3168/jds.2022-218822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0880-844810aInvestigating the effect of temporal, geographic, and management factors on US Holstein lactation curve parameters  ap. 7525-7538.  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWe fit the Wood's lactation model to an extensive database of test-day milk production records of US Holstein cows to obtain lactation-specific parameter estimates and investigated the effects of temporal, spatial, and management factors on lactation curve parameters and 305-d milk yield. Our approach included 2 steps as follows: (1) individual animal-parity parameter estimation with nonlinear least-squares optimization of the Wood's lactation curve parameters, and (2) mixed-effects model analysis of 8,595,413 sets of parameter estimates from individual lactation curves. Further, we conducted an analysis that included all parities and a separate analysis for first lactation heifers. Results showed that parity had the most significant effect on the scale (parameter a), the rate of decay (parameter c), and the 305-d milk yield. The month of calving had the largest effect on the rate of increase (parameter b) for models fit with data from all lactations. The calving month had the most significant effect on all lactation curve parameters for first lactation models. However, age at first calving, year, and milking frequency accounted for a higher proportion of the variance than month for first lactation 305-d milk yield. All parameter estimates and 305-d milk yield increased as parity increased; parameter a and 305-d milk yield rose, and parameters b and c decreased as year and milking frequency increased. Calving month estimates parameters a, b, c, and 305-d milk yield were the lowest values for September, May, June, and July, respectively. The results also indicated the random effects of herd and cow improved model fit. Lactation curve parameter estimates from the mixed-model analysis of individual lactation curve fits describe well US Holstein lactation curves according to temporal, spatial, and management factors.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aHolstein 3acows 3adatabases 3aherds 3alactation 3alactation curve 3aleast squares 3amilk yield 3astatistical models 3avariance 0alactation curve 0aproduction 0aHolstein1 aRosa, G.J.M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9172-64611 aReed, K.F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3936-67231 aCabrera, V.E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1739-74570 tJournal of dairy science.g2022 Sept., v. 105, no. 9 p.7525-7538dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2022-218823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02665naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245015500155300001800310500002000328520133900348592002801687650002401715650002701739650002201766650002501788650002601813650000901839650001401848650001601862650001801878650001501896650000901911650002501920650001601945700001901961700001801980700001301998700001502011773012302026856007302149852000902222655001202231IND60587790120221119214552.0180102e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058779012DNAL7 a10.1111/anu.123252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRolland, M.10aModelling the effects of dietary methionine level and form on postprandial plasma essential amino acid profiles in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss)  ap. 1185-1201.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAquafeed formulation is susceptible to affect amino acid (AA) availability for metabolic functions. Statistical models were applied to quantify the effect of dietary methionine level (from 6.01 to 16.17 g kg⁻¹ dry matter) and form (free, coated or bound) on postprandial concentrations of plasma essential amino acid (EAA) in rainbow trout. Twelve diets were formulated with pea and soya protein concentrate or fish meal as the main protein ingredients and were supplemented or not with increasing amount of either crystalline or agar‐coated methionine. Fish were acclimatized to one of the 12 diets for 6 weeks before postprandial plasma sampling (six sampling points up to 36 h, seven fish each time), further analysed for EAA content. Using generalized additive models, we show that (i) dietary methionine level and form explained 74% postprandial methionine plasma variations and that (ii) the methionine dietary form and plasma concentrations significantly affected the plasma concentrations of the other EAAs. Finally, linear model revealed a positive relationship (R² > 0.9) between plasma concentrations of the three branched‐chain AAs under the present experimental conditions. The results obtained add new information on the dietary effects on EAAs in the plasma availability and the interactions between them.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3aamino acid composition 3aaquaculture feeds 3abiochemical pathways 3aessential amino acids 3afish 3afish meal 3aingredients 3alinear models 3amethionine 3apeas 3aprotein concentrates 3asoy protein1 aFeekings, J.P.1 aDalsgaard, J.1 aHolm, J.1 aSkov, P.V.0 tAquaculture nutrition.g2016 Dec., v. 22, no. 6 p.1185-1201dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl56078x1353-57737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/anu.123253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03292naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001900141245013400160300001800294520165500312592002801967650001201995650001102007650001402018650002202032650003502054650002402089650001502113650002702128650001102155650001402166650002502180650001902205650002502224651001102249653001102260653001702271653001402288653001702302653002402319653002002343653001902363653001702382653002002399653002002419700002702439700002302466700002202489700002602511773011702537856007502654852000902729655001202738IND60114931720221123010107.0141124e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011493172DNAL7 a10.3732/ajb.13003882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLavor, Pâmela10aPopulation genetics of the endemic and endangered Vriesea minarum (Bromeliaceae) in the Iron Quadrangle, Espinhaço Range, Brazil  ap. 1167-1175.  a• Premise of the study: Knowledge about genetic variability in plant populations is one of the main branches of conservation genetics, linking genetic data to conservation strategies. Vriesea minarum is a bromeliad endemic to the Iron Quadrangle region (southeastern Brazil), occurring on mountaintop rock outcrops. It is listed as endangered due to habitat loss, particularly from iron ore mining. Thus, determining the structure and genetic diversity of V. minarum populations could help develop strategies to conserve the species.• Methods: We studied the genetic structure of 12 populations of V. minarum using 10 microsatellite loci transferred from other species of Bromeliaceae. Statistical analyses to compare and describe the genetic diversity of each population were performed, and genetic structure within and among populations, isolation by distance, and Bayesian structure were also analyzed.• Key results: Our results show high inbreeding (GIS = 0.376) and low population structure (FST = 0.088), possibly related to high gene flow due to great pollinator efficiency and/or efficient seed dispersal, thus leading to high connectivity among populations of these fragmented rock outcrops. Two clusters were observed, corresponding to the basins of rivers São Francisco and Doce.• Conclusions: Gene flow among populations is high but, given the rate of habitat loss to mining, most populations are vulnerable and will become increasingly isolated if no action is taken to preserve them. Thus, conservation of this species depends on in situ and ex situ actions, such as controlling overexploitation and creating a germoplasm bank.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVriesea 3abasins 3agene flow 3agenetic variation 3ageographic information systems 3ahabitat destruction 3ainbreeding 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amining 3amountains 3apopulation structure 3aseed dispersal 3astatistical analysis 3aBrazil 0aBrazil 0aBromeliaceae 0abromeliad 0aconservation 0agenetic variability 0aIron Quadrangle 0amicrosatellite 0aMinas Gerais 0aTillandsioideae 0aVriesea minarum1 aBerg, Cássio van den,1 aJacobi, Claudia M.1 aCarmo, Flávio F.1 aVersieux, Leonardo M.0 tAmerican journal of botany.g2014 July, v. 101, no. 7 p.1167-1175dBotanical Society of Americax0002-91227nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3732/ajb.13003883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02449naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245012600158300001800284500002000302520106100322592002801383650001301411650002501424650001201449650001101461650001601472650001601488650001401504650002101518650001201539650001301551650001801564650001201582650001101594650001101605650001001616650001101626700001701637700001501654700002301669700001401692700002701706700001701733773012301750856007301873852000901946655001201955IND60587790220221119214619.0180102e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058779022DNAL7 a10.1111/anu.123282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJakobsen, H.H.10aPlankton composition and biomass development: a seasonal study of a semi‐intensive outdoor system for rearing of turbot  ap. 1239-1250.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aPlankton food web dynamics were studied during a complete production season in a semi‐intensive land‐based facility for rearing of turbot (Scophthalmus maximus) larvae. The production season was divided into three production cycles of 3–5 weeks. Phytoplankton biomass (using chlorophyll a as biomass proxy) peaked in each production cycle. However, the maximum biomass decreased from spring (18 μg chlorophyll a L⁻¹) to fall (ca. 7 μg chlorophyll a L⁻¹), simultaneous with a decline in the concentration of dissolved nitrogen in the inoculating water. During the three production cycles, we observed decreasing copepod nauplii concentration from spring to fall in the rearing tanks. The decreasing nitrogen gave increasing carbon to chlorophyll a ratio in the seston (from 23 in spring to 73 in fall). The pool of free amino acids in seston was constant. We suggest that the decreasing nitrogen input in the inoculating water reduces the quality of the phytoplankton and thus the growth potential of the prey for fish larvae, copepods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCopepoda 3aScophthalmus maximus 3abiomass 3acarbon 3achlorophyll 3afish larvae 3afood webs 3afree amino acids 3anauplii 3anitrogen 3aphytoplankton 3arearing 3aseston 3aspring 3atanks 3aturbot1 aJepsen, P.M.1 aBlanda, E.1 aJørgensen, N.O.G.1 aNovac, A.1 aEngell‐Sørensen, K.1 aHansen, B.W.0 tAquaculture nutrition.g2016 Dec., v. 22, no. 6 p.1239-1250dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl56078x1353-57737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/anu.123283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02521naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002100188245012800209300001600337506007600353520107100429592002801500506003701528650004401565650002801609650002201637650001601659650002201675650001901697650002701716650004401743650001901787650002001806650001101826650001401837700001901851773013901870856008102009852000902090655001202099IND60572590320221207052606.0170717e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057259032DNAL7 a10.1007/s10068-017-0052-z2doi7 aPMC60494242pmcid7 a302635542pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPark, Cheon-Seok14aThe structural characteristics of amylosucrase-treated waxy corn starch and relationship between its in vitro digestibility  ap. 381-387.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe glucotransferase amylosucrase (AS) influences the structural properties of starch, but its precise effects are unclear. The structural characteristics and in vitro digestibility of waxy corn starch modified by AS from Neisseria polysaccharea were examined. AS-treated starch exhibited a higher slowly digestible starch (SDS) fraction, the weak B-type polymorph, lower relative crystallinity, and lower double helix content than those of native starches based on X-ray diffractometry, solid-state ¹³C CP/MAS NMR, and FT-IR. AS-treated starches exhibited increased proportions of degree of polymerization (DP) 25–36 and DP≥37 chains. Higher SDS and resistant (RS) fractions, higher proportions of DP 25–36 and DP≥37 chains, more double helices, higher relative crystallinity, and less difference between double helix and relative crystallinity were observed for starch treated with 460 U than with 230 U of AS. AS re-built the double-helical and rearranged crystalline structure of gelatinized starch and consequently influenced the SDS and RS fractions.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aNeisseria polysaccharea 3aX-ray diffraction 3acorn starch 3acrystal structure 3agelatinization 3ain vitro digestibility 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apolymerization 3astable isotopes 3astarch 3awaxy corn1 aPark, Inmyoung0 tFood science and biotechnology.g2017 Apr., v. 26, no. 2 p.381-387dThe Korean Society of Food Science and Technologyx1226-77087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10068-017-0052-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02091naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132100002500150245010800175300001400283520114500297592002801442650001101470650002201481650001601503650001101519650001401530650001201544700001501556700001301571773009801584856008601682852000901768655001201777IND4467089520221118052140.0141111e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446708952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2010.07.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCastro-Giráldez, M.10aNonlinear thermodynamic approach to analyze long time osmotic dehydration of parenchymatic apple tissue  ap. 34-42.  aOsmotic dehydration experiments of Granny Smith apple were carried out in order to model the operation by using a nonlinear irreversible thermodynamic approach. Samples were immersed into 65% (w/w) sucrose aqueous solution at 30°C during 180, 360, 480, 720, 1463, 1577, 1722, 3375, 4320, 7200, 8540, 10,270min. Some physical–chemical parameters were measured in fresh, treated and reposed (24h at 30°C) samples. The results allow identifying three differentiated steps in the osmotic operation process. At the beginning of the treatment, the cells were turgid and the wall-membrane system stored high level of mechanical energy. In this step, the highest velocity of shrinkage occurred. In the second step, the main driving force was diffusional, with important concentration profiles in the tissue; in this step, the deformation of the tissue reached the maximum shrinkage level of approximately 60%. It produces an important structural change in the tissue removing the concentration profiles and changing the mechanism driving forces. Last step shows internal relaxation of the tissue, increasing the mechanical transport behaviours.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapples 3aaqueous solutions 3adeformation 3aenergy 3ashrinkage 3asucrose1 aFito, P.J.1 aFito, P.0 tJournal of food engineering.g2011 Jan., v. 102, no. 1 p.34-42dElsevier Ltdx0260-87747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2010.07.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02497naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001600154245012400170300001600294520138000310592002801690653000801718653002601726653000801752653002601760653000801786700002501794700001601819700002401835700002301859700002501882700002101907773012201928856008802050852000902138655001202147IND60520382920221119131124.0160520e20140129xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052038292DNAL7 a10.3889/mjms.1857-5773.2013.03262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSimic, Ivan10aFractional Flow Reserve Method in Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory without Cardiosurgical Backup: Initial Experiences  ap. 388-391.  aBackground: Coronary artery disease is the most common cause of death in a modern world. This dictates the development a network of Catheterization laboratories without cardiosurgical capabilities. Aim: We postulate that the most valuable tool in the decision process on myocardial revascularization is fractional flow reserve (FFR), especially when we deal with borderline coronary lesions. Material and Methods: A total of 72 patients with 94 intermediate coronary stenosis (30%-70% diameter reduction) were included in this study. We tested FFR and angiography based decision model on myocardial revascularization. Results: Mean FFR value on left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) was lower than in others two arteries (p=0.017). FFR after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was significantly better (p<0.0001). The decision for PCI predominates before FFR diagnostics, but after FFR the decision is quite opposite. There is a weak negative correlation between FFR and diameter of stenosis assessed by angiography (r= - 0.245 p=0.038) and positive correlation between diameter of stenosis assessed by angiography and by quantitative coronary angiography (QCA) (r=0.406 p<0.0005). Conclusion: Our results strongly suggest that FFR is necessary tool in centers without possibilities of heart team onsite consultation and that prevents numerous unnecessary PCI.  aPublisher supplied data 0aFFR 0aintermediate stenosis 0aPCI 0acardiosurgical backup 0aQCA1 aZdravkovic, Vladimir1 aVucic, Rada1 aIric-Cupic, Violeta1 aDavidović, Goran,1 aIgnjatovic, Vladimir1 aBankovic, Dragic0 tMacedonian journal of medical sciences.g2014 Jan. 29, v. 6, no. 4 p.388-391dVersitawJournal:23186x1857-57497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3889/mjms.1857-5773.2013.03263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02892naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005700094040001800151100002100169245017000190300001800360520167700378592002802055653002302083653002402106653001902130653007602149653002202225700002302247700002102270700002002291773014102311856011702452852000902569655001202578IND60126917120221123022857.0151108e200009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012691712DNAL7 a10.1603/0013-8746(2000)093[1138:DOTPSB]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPachamuthu, Pari10aDifferentiation of Three Phenotypically Similar Blattella spp.: Analysis with Polymerase Chain Reaction-Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism of Mitochondrial DNA  ap. 1138-1146.  aDifferentiation of Blattella asahinai Mizukubo, Blattella vaga Hebard, and Blattella germanica (L.) was investigated using polymerase chain reaction––restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). DNA fragments corresponding to mitochondrial CO1, CO1/TL2 (small and large fragments), and ITS2 regions were amplified using PCR. The universal primers used for amplifying mitochondrial CO1 and CO1/TL2 (small and large fragments) were CO1-J-1718/CO1-N-2191, CO1-J-2441/TL2-N-3014, and CO1-J-1751/TL2-N-3014. Amplification was observed with all primer combinations, but diagnostic patterns were found only with Alu I digested amplicons of CO1 and CO1/TL2 (large fragments) regions. Both inter/intraspecific polymorphism was observed for the 517 bp CO1 region between German (A, B) and Asian (A, B, C) cockroach populations. Polymorphic form B of the Asian cockroach (374 and 179 bp fragments) was nearly identical to the field cockroach (370 and 178 bp fragments). The CO1 amplicon (517 bp) differentiated German and field cockroaches but not Asian and field cockroaches. The CO1/TL2 amplicons (1275 bp) digested with Alu I clearly differentiated all three species. The Asian cockroach had a distinct 540 bp fragment, whereas the field cockroach had a 403 bp fragment and the German cockroach lacked both fragments. Intraspecific polymorphs for CO1/TL2 amplicons (1275 bp) were observed with the German cockroach only. Portions of the CO1 and TL2 genes were sequenced, revealing 76% identity among German, Asian, and field cockroaches. Sequence data also revealed that German and Asian cockroaches were more closely related to each other than to the field cockroach.  aPublisher supplied data 0aBlattella asahinai 0aBlattella germanica 0aBlattella vaga 0apolymerase chain reaction––restriction fragment length polymorphism 0amitochondrial DNA1 aKamble, Shripat T.1 aClark, Thomas L.1 aFoster, John E.0 tAnnals of the Entomological Society of America.g2000 Sept., v. 93, no. 5 p.1138-1146dEntomological Society of Americax0013-87467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603%2F0013-8746%282000%29093%5B1138%3ADOTPSB%5D2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02447naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004300092040001800135100001700153245010600170300001400276520127900290592002801569650002401597650001501621650000901636650001401645650002201659650001701681650002601698650002001724650000901744650001501753650001201768650001001780650002201790700002101812700003001833773008801863856008901951852000902040655001202049IND4465243920221120095955.0141110e20111116xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446524392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2011.08.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBajc, Zlatka10aElimination of malachite green residues from meat of rainbow trout and carp after water-born exposure  ap. 13-16.  aUptake, accumulation and depuration of malachite green (MG) in muscle and skin of rainbow trout and carp were studied. The concentrations of MG and its mayor metabolite leuchomalachite green (LMG) were determined with liquid chromatography coupled with an absorbance and a fluorescence detector. Rainbow trout were exposed to 1mgl⁻¹ of MG for 1 and 3h and to a slightly increased concentration 1.5mgl⁻¹ for 1h. Changing the dose of MG in the bath did not significantly affect the residue levels in rainbow trout, but the duration of the exposure had a major influence. One day after exposure, the rainbow trout that were exposed three times longer contained 3 times more LMG and 4.5 times more MG than the trout in the one-hour bath. The level of MG in rainbow trout quickly fell below the decision limit (CCα) of 0.6μgkg⁻¹, while the level of LMG was still greater than 0.5μgkg⁻¹ (CCα) at the end of the experiment (289days after exposure). Carp were exposed to higher concentrations of MG, 2mgl⁻¹ for 1 and 3h, and 4mgl⁻¹ for 1h. Nevertheless, they accumulated less MG than rainbow trout and the elimination of LMG was slower. Because of the low water temperature (11°C–15°C), the carp metabolism, and therefore also LMG elimination, were slowed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3aabsorbance 3acarp 3adetectors 3aexposure duration 3afluorescence 3aliquid chromatography 3amalachite green 3ameat 3ametabolism 3amuscles 3atrout 3awater temperature1 aJenčič, Vlasta1 aŠinigoj Gačnik, Ksenija0 tAquaculture.g2011 Nov. 16, v. 321, no. 1-2 p.13-16dElsevier B.V.x0044-84867nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2011.08.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02100naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245008800171300001600259520081700275592002801092650001001120650002501130650001801155650001301173650002301186650001801209650001401227650002401241650001101265650002201276650001801298653001801316653002201334653003001356653001301386700001601399700001301415700001301428700001701441773010001458856008701558852000901645655001201654IND60542374220221119030358.0190402e20150601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054237422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2014.12.0792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Ji-Young,10aAntioxidant properties of ascorbic acid in bulk oils at different relative humidity  ap. 302-307.  aThe effects of relative humidity (RH) on the antioxidant properties of ascorbic acid (10, 20, 42, and 84ppm) were investigated in stripped corn oils stored at 60°C. The degree of oxidation in oils was determined by analysing headspace oxygen content and conjugated dienoic acids. The oxidative stability of bulk oils without addition of ascorbic acid was significantly different depending on the RH. As the concentration of ascorbic acid increased from 10 to 84ppm, oxidative stability increased significantly irrespective of RH (p<0.05). Generally, oils containing ascorbic acid at low RH had higher oxidative stability after storage at 60°C than those at high RH.

The results show that the hydrology of the catchment is extremely dynamic and the catchment is flashy in nature. A decreasing trend in peak flow amount and an increasing trend in baseflow amount was observed in the catchment, indicating that continuous drainage has reduced the risk of both flooding and water scarcity in the catchment. Correlation analysis among rainfall, runoff and groundwater table reveals that saturation excess-near surface flow is the dominant mechanism responsible for rapid runoff generation in the catchment. Therefore, any physical alterations or disturbances to the upper part of the peat profile would definitely affect the overall hydrological behaviour of the peat catchment.  aPublisher supplied data 3abase flow 3adrainage 3ahydrologic data 3aoverland flow 3apeat 3arain 3arisk reduction 3arunoff 3atropics 3awater table 3awatershed hydrology 3awatersheds 0adrained peat catchment 0arainfall 0awater table 0arunoff ratio 0atropics1 aShahid, Shamsuddin1 aKhairi Abd Wahab, Ahmad1 aAli, Md.

It was found that α-CD significantly modifies the gelation behavior of Pluronic solutions and that the PPR hydrogels are highly sensitive to changes in the α-CD concentration. In some cases, the addition of α-CD was found to be detrimental to the gelation process, leading to slower gelation kinetics and weaker gels than with Pluronic alone. However, in other cases, the hydrogels formed in the presence of the α-CDs reached higher moduli and showed faster gelation kinetics than with Pluronic alone and in some instances α-CD allowed the formation of hydrogels from Pluronic solutions that would normally not undergo gelation. Depending on composition and ratio of α-CD/Pluronic, these highly viscoelastic hydrogels displayed elastic shear modulus values ranging from 2 kPa to 7 MPa, gelation times ranging from a few seconds to a few hours and self-healing behaviors post failure. Using dynamic light scattering (DLS) and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), we probed the resident structure of these systems, and from these insights we have proposed a new molecular mechanism that accounts for the macroscopic properties observed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aalpha-cyclodextrin 3acomposite polymers 3agelation 3ahydrogels 3alight scattering 3amodulus of elasticity 3apolyethylene glycol 3apolypropylenes 3atemperature 3aviscoelasticity1 aJack, Kevin

As an ingredient of the CLF, CNF is isolated from hardwood by the combination of chemical and physical methods. A wet-state cellulose long fiber (WCLF) is fabricated by wet spinning. 5T magnetic field, generated in a superconducting DC magnet, is applied to perpendicular to the WCLF. An electric field of 50 V/cm at 100 Hz is applied along the WCLF between two electrode supports. Scanning electron microscopy, two-dimensional wide-angle X-ray diffraction and tensile test demonstrate that when the magnetic and electric fields are applied simultaneously, its Young’s modulus, tensile strength, yield strength, strain at break and toughness of the fabricated CLF are greatly improved with the highest degree of CNF orientation. Unusual toughness improvement of the CLF with other mechanical properties is very promising for fabricating strong and tough CLF.  aPublisher supplied data  aNRF-2015R1A3A2066301cNational Research Foundation of Korea 3acellulose 3acellulose nanofibers 3acellulosic fibers 3aelectric field 3aelectrodes 3ahardwood 3aingredients 3amagnetic fields 3amagnetic materials 3amodulus of elasticity 3ascanning electron microscopy 3aspinning 3atensile strength 3awide-angle X-ray scattering1 aKim, Jung Woong1 aZhai, Lindong1 aKim, Jaehwan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6152-29240 tCellulose.g2019 July, v. 26, no. 10 p.5821-5829dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3871471x0969-02397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10570-019-02496-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03061naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002400189245014100213300001600354520157000370592002801940650002301968650002201991650002202013650001602035650000902051650001902060650001202079650001802091650001502109650001102124650003002135650001602165653002102181653002802202700002102230700001802251700001702269700001702286773020902303856008202512852000902594655001202603IND60690661320221122221151.0200508e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069066132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jaim.2016.08.0042doi7 aPMC51922582pmcid7 a278907012pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSrivastava, Bhavana10aEvaluation for substitution of stem bark with small branches of Myrica esculenta for medicinal use – A comparative phytochemical study  ap. 218-223.  aOver exploitation of many traditional medicinal plants like Myrica esculenta has become a threat and in the near future, many medicinal plants may be unavailable for use of industry.Present study outlines the concept of plant part substitution. Stem bark and small branches of M. esculenta are compared on the basis of physicochemical analysis, phytochemical analysis, total phenolic contents, total flavonoid contents and high performance thin layer chromatography (HPTLC) to evaluate the possibilities of using small branches in place of stem bark.Physicochemical parameters and preliminary phytochemical screening were carried out using standard methods. Total phenolic and total flavonoid contents were estimated spectrophotometrically using Folin-Ciocalteu and aluminum chloride method, respectively. CAMAG HPTLC system equipped with semi-automatic applicator was used for HPTLC profiling. n-Hexane, ethyl acetate and ethanol extracts of stem bark and small branches were developed in suitable mobile phase using standard procedures and visualized in UV 254 and 366 nm and in white light after derivatization within anisaldehyde-sulphuric acid reagent.Phytochemical analysis and HPTLC profile of different extracts showed the presence of almost similar phytochemicals in both stem bark and small branches.Similarities in phytochemical analysis and HPTLC profile of various extracts suggests that small branches may be used in place of stem bark. The study provides the base for further study to use small branches as a substitute of stem bark of M. esculenta.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAyurvedic medicine 3aMorella esculenta 3aaluminum chloride 3aapplicators 3abark 3aderivatization 3aethanol 3aethyl acetate 3aflavonoids 3ahexane 3athin layer chromatography 3awhite light 0aMyrica esculenta 0aPlant part substitution1 aSharma, Vikas C.1 aPant, Pramila1 aPandey, N.K.1 aJadhav, A.D.0 tJournal of Ayurveda and integrative medicine.g2016 Oct.,  Dec., v. 7, no. 4 p.218-223dElsevier B.V.aTransdisciplinary University, Bangalore and World Ayurveda FoundationwJournal:27111x0975-94767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaim.2016.08.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03329naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003300135040001800168100002000186245009500206300001100301506007600312520177100388592002802159506003702187650002502224650001802249650001402267650002002281650001202301650002802313650001102341650001802352650002702370650001202397650001302409650001102422650002802433650001402461650001502475650001202490650001402502650001102516700002202527700001902549700002102568700002102589773010102610856007902711852000902790655001202799IND60119418120221207072039.0190919e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011941812DNAL7 a212321312pmid7 aPMC30913012pmcid7 a10.1186/gb-2011-12-1-r32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aScherrer, Tanja10aDefining potentially conserved RNA regulons of homologous zinc-finger RNA-binding proteins  ap. R3.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Glucose inhibition of gluconeogenic growth suppressor 2 protein (Gis2p) and zinc-finger protein 9 (ZNF9) are conserved yeast and human zinc-finger proteins. The function of yeast Gis2p is unknown, but human ZNF9 has been reported to bind nucleic acids, and mutations in the ZNF9 gene cause the neuromuscular disease myotonic dystrophy type 2. To explore the impact of these proteins on RNA regulation, we undertook a systematic analysis of the RNA targets and of the global implications for gene expression. RESULTS: Hundreds of mRNAs were associated with Gis2p, mainly coding for RNA processing factors, chromatin modifiers and GTPases. Target mRNAs contained stretches of G(A/U)(A/U) trinucleotide repeats located in coding sequences, which are sufficient for binding to both Gis2p and ZNF9, thus implying strong structural conservation. Predicted ZNF9 targets belong to the same functional categories as seen in yeast, indicating functional conservation, which is further supported by complementation of the large cell-size phenotype of gis2 mutants with ZNF9. We further applied a matched-sample proteome-transcriptome analysis suggesting that Gis2p differentially coordinates expression of RNA regulons, primarily by reducing mRNA and protein levels of genes required for ribosome assembly and by selectively up-regulating protein levels of myosins. CONCLUSIONS: This integrated systematic exploration of RNA targets for homologous RNA-binding proteins indicates an unexpectedly high conservation of the RNA-binding properties and of potential targets, thus predicting conserved RNA regulons. We also predict regulation of muscle-specific genes by ZNF9, adding a potential link to the myotonic dystrophy related phenotypes seen in ZNF9 mouse models.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aRNA-binding proteins 3aanimal models 3achromatin 3agene expression 3aglucose 3aguanosinetriphosphatase 3ahumans 3amessenger RNA 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amutants 3amutation 3amyosin 3aneuromuscular disorders 3aphenotype 3aprediction 3aregulon 3aribosomes 3ayeasts1 aFemmer, Christian1 aSchiess, Ralph1 aAebersold, Ruedi1 aGerber, André P0 tGenome biology.g2011 Jan., v. 12, no. 1 p.R3-R3dBioMed CentralwJournal:19127x1474-760X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/gb-2011-12-1-r33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01667naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100001600181245006800197300002000265506007600285520053800361592002800899506003700927650001200964650002300976650002300999650001101022650001201033700002301045700003001068773013601098856007401234852000901308655001201317IND60619237220221207113042.0181031e20181030xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061923722DNAL7 a10.1039/c8cc07267a2doi7 aPMC62436752pmcid7 a303109112pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Guojiao10aRegiocontrol in the cobalt-catalyzed hydrosilylation of alkynes  ap. 12322-12325.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aHydrofunctionalizations of unsaturated hydrocarbons are key strategies for the synthesis of functionalized building blocks.

Karst (O. mapora) is an Amazon palm with high economic and nutraceutical potential, from which the pulp and oil can be extracted. The objective of this study was to evaluate the phenology of O. mapora in low-terrace and high-terrace forests of the Madre de Dios Region, Peru. Two hundred sixteen individuals of O. mapora were monitored between June 2019 and January 2020, evaluating the presence of flower buds, open flowers, immature fruits and ripe fruits. Weighted mean analyses of the phenological pattern and correlation between climatic and phenological variables were carried out. Higher productivity mediated by a greater number of mature green leaves and bunches was observed in terrace forests located at a lower altitude. In both forest subtypes, flower buds and open flowers were continuous with a peak in July and August, respectively, during the dry season. In both habitats, unripe fruits were also continuous with a peak in September, while ripe fruits showed a peak in December and January in low-terrace and high-terrace forests, respectively, during the rainy season. Our findings show that flowering was continuous during the evaluated period, while fruiting increased during the rainy season associated with a greater number of days with precipitation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOenocarpus 3aaltitude 3adietary supplements 3adry season 3aflowers 3aforests 3aoils 3aphenology 3apulp 3awet season 3aPeru1 aRengifo, Helmut 1 aVelarde, Ernesto 1 aLoja, Juan Francisco1 aPortugal, Alan 1 aRengifo, Piero 1 aAguilar Salazar, Luis,1 aRamos-Escudero, Fernando 1 aMuñoz, Ana María,0 tForests.g2021 Oct. 19, v. 12, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f121014243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02019naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245008800160300002000248520088800268592002801156650001501184650001401199650001601213650001701229650002001246650001401266650001701280650002201297650001701319700002201336700002701358700002001385700001901405773013701424856007501561852000901636655001201645IND60536922520221118135859.0160807e20120919xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053692252DNAL7 a10.1021/ie202950h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Zhuangqun10aSpectroscopic Studies of Light-driven Water Oxidation Catalyzed by Polyoxometalates  ap. 11850-11859.  aThis review is focused on the spectroscopic studies of the charge transfer dynamics in polyoxometalate (POM)-catalyzed artificial photodriven water oxidation systems. We first describe the general challenges in solar fuel production, showing that water oxidation catalysts (WOCs) are of central importance. After the introduction of a new class of highly efficient WOCs based on all-inorganic polyoxometalates, we summarize the performance of these WOCs in homogeneous water oxidation systems. We show that the individual steps involved in the overall light-driven water oxidation reaction can be investigated by spectroscopic techniques (fluorescence quenching, transient absorption, and stopped flow). These studies provide important insight into the factors that limit the overall conversion efficiency in these systems and suggest possible approaches for improving these devices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3acatalysts 3aengineering 3afluorescence 3afuel production 3aoxidation 3asolar energy 3aspectral analysis 3aspectroscopy1 aGeletii, Yurii V.1 aMusaev, Djamaladdin G.1 aHill, Craig L.,1 aLian, Tianquan0 tIndustrial & Engineering Chemistry Research.g2012 Sept. 19, v. 51, no. 37 p.11850-11859dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fie202950h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02311naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001500139245016200154300001600316500002000332520118800352592002801540650001601568650002001584650001301604650001001617650000901627650001601636650001201652650001201664651001801676700001701694700002101711773013501732856007301867852000901940655001201949IND60590845220221123031819.0180314e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059084522DNAL7 a10.1111/ahe.123302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVélez, J.13aAn anatomic description of intrinsic brachial muscles in the crab‐eating fox (Cerdocyon thous, Linnaeus 1776) and report of a variant arterial distribution  ap. 180-183.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe crab‐eating fox (Cerdocyon thous) is a wild canid distributed throughout South America. It is one of the wild canids reported being hit by vehicles and injured in snares, thus inducing trauma or injury to the musculoskeletal system, possibly occurring in the brachial region. The main objective of this research was to provide an anatomic description of the crab‐eating fox's intrinsic brachial muscles including shape, origin, insertion, innervation and arterial blood supply, compared with that of the domestic dog. We dissected from superficial to deep two thoracic limbs of seven dead specimens donated to the University of Caldas by CORPOCALDAS. These muscles presented anatomic characteristics similar to those reported in the domestic dog (Canis lupus familiaris) but with a variant in arterial blood supply, allowing us to suggest that surgical procedures that need the knowledge of intrinsic brachial muscles in the crab‐eating fox may be homologous to the domestic dog. However, one should consider its variant arterial distribution by part of the collateral radial artery and deep brachial artery to prevent incorrect incisions that may damage these arteries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCanis lupus 3aCerdocyon thous 3aarteries 3ablood 3adogs 3ainnervation 3amuscles 3asurgery 3aSouth America1 aRamírez, J.1 aAristizábal, O.0 tAnatomia, histologia, embryologia.g2018 Apr., v. 47, no. 2 p.180-183dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3895878x0340-20967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ahe.123303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03183naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092024002200121024001900143040001800162100002200180245009600202300001800298506007600316520183500392592002802227506003702255650002502292650001302317650001702330650002002347650001202367650001002379650003002389650000902419650001402428650002002442650001102462700002202473700002002495700002402515773012202539856007902661852000902740655001202749IND4501675720221207102641.0150427e20111001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND450167572DNAL7 a10.1128/JB.05337-112doi7 aPMC31874452pmcid7 a218040002pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCoyne, Michael J.10aUDP-Glucuronic Acid Decarboxylases of Bacteroides fragilis and Their Prevalence in Bacteria  ap. 5252-5259.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aXylose is rarely described as a component of bacterial glycans. UDP-xylose is the nucleotide-activated form necessary for incorporation of xylose into glycans and is synthesized by the decarboxylation of UDP-glucuronic acid (UDP-GlcA). Enzymes with UDP-GlcA decarboxylase activity include those that lead to the formation of UDP-xylose as the end product (Uxs type) and those synthesizing UDP-xylose as an intermediate (ArnA and RsU4kpxs types). In this report, we identify and confirm the activities of two Uxs-type UDP-GlcA decarboxylases of Bacteroides fragilis, designated BfUxs1 and BfUxs2. Bfuxs1 is located in a conserved region of the B. fragilis genome, whereas Bfuxs2 is in the heterogeneous capsular polysaccharide F (PSF) biosynthesis locus. Deletion of either gene separately does not result in the loss of a detectable phenotype, but deletion of both genes abrogates PSF synthesis, strongly suggesting that they are functional paralogs and that the B. fragilis NCTC 9343 PSF repeat unit contains xylose. UDP-GlcA decarboxylases are often annotated incorrectly as NAD-dependent epimerases/dehydratases; therefore, their prevalence in bacteria is underappreciated. Using available structural and mutational data, we devised a sequence pattern to detect bacterial genes encoding UDP-GlcA decarboxylase activity. We identified 826 predicted UDP-GlcA decarboxylase enzymes in diverse bacterial species, with the ArnA and RsU4kpxs types confined largely to proteobacterial species. These data suggest that xylose, or a monosaccharide requiring a UDP-xylose intermediate, is more prevalent in bacterial glycans than previously appreciated. Genes encoding BfUxs1-like enzymes are highly conserved in Bacteroides species, indicating that these abundant intestinal microbes may synthesize a conserved xylose-containing glycan.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBacteroides fragilis 3abacteria 3abiosynthesis 3adecarboxylation 3aenzymes 3agenes 3aintestinal microorganisms 3aloci 3aphenotype 3apolysaccharides 3axylose1 aFletcher, C.

Synthesized hydrogel was used for oil adsorption from aqueous solution. Different reaction parameters like adsorbent dosage, contact time, temperature and pH were optimized to obtained the maximum crude oil adsorption. The chemical structure and morphology of the synthesized hydrogel were studied using FTIR and SEM techniques. Thermal behavior of the synthesized hydrogel was studied using TGA and DTG techniques. Synthesized hydrogel was thermally more stable than the backbone. Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models were used to study the experimental data of the oil adsorption. The results showed that oil is adsorbed according to the Langmuir model. The adsorption kinetics was also studied and found that oil adsorption followed the pseudo-second-order kinetics. The synthesized hydrogel is very effective for the adsorption of oil.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aaqueous solutions 3acellulose 3achemical structure 3achitosan 3adifferential thermal analysis 3ahydrogels 3amodels 3aoils 3apH 3apetroleum 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asorption isotherms 3atemperature 3athermal properties 3athermogravimetry1 aKumar, Vaneet0 tCellulose.g2019 July, v. 26, no. 10 p.6229-6239dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3871471x0969-02397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10570-019-02539-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03599naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245011000157520219400267592002802461650002002489650002002509650001802529650002002547650002202567650001702589650001402606650001402620650001002634650001502644650001802659650001602677650001702693650001102710650002002721651002802741651001202769700002002781700001802801700002102819700002402840700002202864700002702886773012102913856007403034852000903108655001203117IND60754211320221122050649.0211023e20211019xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075421132DNAL7 a10.3390/f121014252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDegen, Bernd 10aImpact of Gene Flow and Introgression on the Range Wide Genetic Structure of Quercus robur (L.) in Europe  aAs for most other temperate broadleaved tree species, large-scale genetic inventories of pedunculate oak (Quercus robur L.) have focused on the plastidial genome, which showed the impact of post-glacial recolonization and manmade seed transfer. However, how have pollen mediated gene flow and introgression impacted the large-scale genetic structure? To answer these questions, we did a genetic inventory on 1970 pedunculate oak trees from 197 locations in 13 European countries. All samples were screened with a targeted sequencing approach on a set of 381 polymorphic loci (356 nuclear SNPs, 3 nuclear InDels, 17 chloroplast SNPs, and 5 mitochondrial SNPs). In a former analysis with additional 1763 putative Quercus petraea trees screened for the same gene markers we obtained estimates on the species admixture of all pedunculate oak trees. We identified 13 plastidial haplotypes, which showed a strong spatial pattern with a highly significant autocorrelation up to a range of 1250 km. Significant spatial genetic structure up to 1250 km was also observed at the nuclear loci. However, the differentiation at the nuclear gene markers was much lower compared to the organelle gene markers. The matrix of genetic distances among locations was partially correlated between nuclear and organelle genomes. Bayesian clustering analysis revealed the best fit to the data for a sub-division into two gene pools. One gene pool is dominating the west and the other is the most abundant in the east. The western gene pool was significantly influenced by introgression from Quercus petraea in the past. In Germany, we identified a contact zone of pedunculate oaks with different introgression intensity, likely resulting from different historical levels of introgression in glacial refugia or during postglacial recolonization. The main directions of postglacial recolonization were south to north and south to northwest in West and Central Europe, and for the eastern haplotypes also east to west in Central Europe. By contrast, the pollen mediated gene flow and introgression from Q. petraea modified the large-scale structure at the nuclear gene markers with significant west–east direction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aQuercus petraea 3aQuercus robur 3aautocorrelation 3abroadleaved trees 3achloroplasts 3agene flow 3agene pool 3agenes 3ahaplotypes 3aintrogression 3ainventories 3amitochondria 3apollen 3arefuge habitats 3aCentral European region 3aGermany1 aYanbaev, Yulai 1 aMader, Malte 1 aIanbaev, Ruslan 1 aBakhtina, Svetlana 1 aSchroeder, Hilke 1 aBlanc-Jolivet, Celine 0 tForests.g2021 Oct. 19, v. 12, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f121014253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03339naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100001800189245016300207300001600370520180100386592002802187650002302215650001402238650001802252650002602270650001302296651001002309653003202319653002002351653002802371653001402399653003002413653001302443653001602456653004302472700002702515700006202542773021002604856008202814852000902896655001202905IND60690661720221122221139.0200508e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069066172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jaim.2016.06.0052doi7 aPMC50523622pmcid7 a276374472pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, Deepti10a“What do Ayurveda Postgraduate Entrance Examinations actually assess?” – Results of a five-year period question-paper analysis based on Bloom's taxonomy  ap. 167-172.  aThe standards of Ayurveda education in India are being questioned in the recent years and many suggestions related to educational reforms are being put forth by educators and health policy experts. However, the Post Graduate Entrance Examinations (PGEEs) that are carried out to select the candidates to pursue postgraduate programs have received little attention in this context.The objective of this study was to classify the Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) from Ayurveda PGEEs conducted in different universities of India during the five year period (ranging from 2010 to 2014) into six levels of Bloom's Taxonomy in cognitive domain.This is a retrospective observational study. The sampling method followed was purposive sampling. Totally, 3299 MCQs obtained out of 25 question papers from seven universities spread across four zones of India (North, South, West and East) were included in the study and were classified based on the Bloom's taxonomy.About 93.3% of MCQs assessed only the ‘recall’ component whereas 6.2% of the MCQs assessed ‘comprehension’. Percentage of MCQs that assessed ‘application’ level was a mere 0.3% whereas the percentage of MCQs that assessed the ‘analysis’ component was found to be only 0.2%. There was not even a single question to assess the ‘synthesis’ and ‘evaluation’ components.We conclude that an appropriate proportion of MCQs assessing ‘higher order thinking’ are required to be included in Ayurveda PGEEs. While it is possible to frame MCQs to assess all six levels of Bloom's taxonomy in cognitive domain, the teachers are required to be trained well in the skills of MCQ writing. We propose that our study may be taken as a lead to introduce the required reforms in PGEEs.Clinical Trial Registration No.: Not applicable.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAyurvedic medicine 3acognition 3ahealth policy 3aobservational studies 3ataxonomy 3aIndia 0aTraditional Indian medicine 0aQualifying test 0aAssessment in education 0aEducation 0aMultiple choice questions 0aAyurveda 0aExamination 0aHigher order thinking Bloom's taxonomy1 aTripathi, Piyush Kumar1 aPatwardhan, Kishor1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4992-53760 tJournal of Ayurveda and integrative medicine.g2016 July,  Sept., v. 7, no. 3 p.167-172dElsevier B.V.aTransdisciplinary University, Bangalore and World Ayurveda FoundationwJournal:27111x0975-94767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaim.2016.06.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02783naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100003300139245011100172520136700283592002801650650001501678650002101693650001201714650001401726650001101740650001401751650001701765650001401782650002301796650002101819650002601840650001601866700002901882700002401911700001901935700003301954700003801987700003702025700002602062700004502088773012102133856007402254852000902328655001202337IND60754211420221120100603.0211023e20211019xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075421142DNAL7 a10.3390/f121014262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGodoi, Natasha Mirella Inhã10aResidual Influence of Nitrogen, Phosphorus and Potassium Doses on Soil and Eucalyptus Nutrition in Coppice  aThe management of fertilizer is an important strategy for better nutrition and productivity of eucalyptus. Therefore, the objective of this research was to evaluate the isolated residual effect (carryover) of N, P and K fertilization on macro- and micronutrients in soil, leaf litter, leaf nutritional diagnosis and initial growth attributes of eucalyptus in a coppice system. Three experiments were carried out in a randomized block design with five replications. Experiment 1: four residual doses of N (0, 70, 105 and 140 kg ha⁻¹) were applied as ammonium nitrate. Experiment 2: four residual doses of P2O5 (0, 40, 70 and 100 kg ha⁻¹) were applied to plantations in furrows using triple superphosphate. Experiment 3: four residual K₂O doses (0, 90, 135 and 180 kg ha⁻¹) were applied as potassium chloride. The residual N doses did not influence leaf nutrient contents and initial growth of eucalyptus; however, increasing P residual doses increased soil P and Zn content, litter K content, decreased leaf Mg content, and increased initial growth (height and wood volume of eucalyptus). The residual K doses increased leaf litter K content and leaf Mn and Zn content but decreased leaf litter Ca, B and Fe and leaf Mg content.

Its occurrence is well-known in pets, kennelled dogs and stray animals, and its eggs contaminate the ground in urban areas all over the world. Moreover, T. vulpis has been occasionally incriminated, though not convincingly substantiated, as a cause of zoonosis. This nematode is erroneously considered an "old-fashioned" pathogen with a consequent lack of up- to- date knowledge on several aspects of the infection. These, in turn, are still controversial and need to be studied in greater depth. This article reviews current knowledge of T. vulpis, together with a discussion of critical points in epidemiology, zoonotic hazard, diagnosis and treatment of canine trichurosis.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aTrichuris vulpis 3adogs 3aeggs 3aepidemiology 3aparasitoses 3apathogens 3apets 3astray animals 3aurban areas 3aveterinary clinics 3azoonoses 2aAnimals 2aAnthelminticsxadministration & dosage 2aDog Diseasesxdrug therapyxepidemiologyxparasitology. 2aDogs 2aTrichuriasisxepidemiologyxveterinary. 2aTrichurisxisolation & purificationxpathogenicity. 2aZoonosesxepidemiologyxparasitology.0 tParasites & vectors.g2011 Dec., v. 4, no. 1 p.279-279dSpringer-Verlagx1756-33057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1756-3305-4-32  aDNAL 7aarticle02836naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245011200156300001600268500002000284520162100304592002801925650001701953650001001970650000901980650001501989650001402004650001702018650001402035650001902049650001302068650001602081650001102097650001202108650002402120650003302144650001002177650001002187773013502197856007302332852000902405655001202414IND60590845520221123031844.0180314e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059084552DNAL7 a10.1111/ahe.123422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKavoi, B.

In this study, a histological and ultrastructural analysis was carried out on the olfactory mucosa (OM) of the rufous sengi (Elephantulus rufescens) and the data were compared with those reported earlier in the dog (Canis familiaris) and the sheep (Ovis aries), whose dietary lifestyles are carnivorous and herbivorous, respectively. Qualitatively, the microstructure of the sengi's OM was basically similar to that of the other eutherian mammals except for differences in the pattern of cilia projection from the dendritic knobs of the olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) and distribution of Bowman's glands within the lamina propria of the OM. On morphometry, significant differences (p < .05) were recorded with respect to olfactory epithelial (OE) thickness between the sengi (65.4 ± 2.6 μm) and the other species. ORN packing density and cilia number/ORN knob varied markedly only between the sengi (73.8 ± 5.4 mm⁻² × 10³ and 15 ± 4, respectively) and the sheep. No remarkable differences were noted in regard to ORN bundle diameters between sengis (62.7 ± 12.5 μm) and the other species. The observed differences in OM structural refinement may be attributed to olfactory function demand levels related to feeding lifestyles and ecology. Myrmecophagous insectivory, social monogamy, absentee maternal care and exposed sheltering habits are behavioural features that may warrant substantial OM modification in sengis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aElephantulus 3acilia 3adogs 3aherbivores 3ahistology 3ainsectivores 3alifestyle 3amicrostructure 3amonogamy 3amorphometry 3amucosa 3aneurons 3aolfactory receptors 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asheep 3asmell0 tAnatomia, histologia, embryologia.g2018 Apr., v. 47, no. 2 p.167-173dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3895878x0340-20967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ahe.123423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02664naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002600148245015100174300001800325520127000343592002801613596005801641650001501699650001501714650002401729650002501753650001401778650002401792650001101816650001501827650001101842650000701853650001401860650003301874650001501907650002001922700001801942700001901960700001801979700001801997773011202015856008202127852000902209655001202218IND60647017120221118193723.0190614e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064701712DNAL7 a10.1007/s10570-019-02531-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarba, Zaharaddeen N.10aEnhanced removal of prometryn using copper modified microcrystalline cellulose (Cu-MCC): optimization, isotherm, kinetics and regeneration studies  ap. 6241-6258.  aIn this work, we incorporated Cu²⁺ on to microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) powder by a simple synthesis method to produce a composite material (Cu-MCC) with its suitability in prometryn (Pr) adsorption tested from synthetic wastewater. Various characterization techniques were applied in studying the prepared Cu-MCC with response surface methodology applied in order to study the influence of adsorbent dosage, solution pH and shaking speed, which suggested a quadratic model for the response (Pr percentage removal). The optimum adsorption conditions obtained were adsorbent dosage of 0.40 g, solution pH of 11 and shaking speed of 215 rpm with the model adequacy and significance validated by ANOVA. Langmuir and pseudo-second order were the most appropriate models in describing the generated equilibrium and kinetic data, giving rise to a monolayer adsorption capacity value of 97.80 mg/g at room temperature. The desorption of Pr on Cu-MCC was also probed depicting the adsorption capacity to be about 66.7% of its initial value after six sequential adsorption–desorption cycles. Overall, the prepared Cu-MCC was revealed to have great potential for being a good adsorbent in the removal of water contaminants such as Pr, based on the obtained results.  aPublisher supplied data  aKXB16001AcFujian Agriculture and Forestry University 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aambient temperature 3aanalysis of variance 3acellulose 3acomposite materials 3acopper 3adesorption 3amodels 3apH 3aprometryn 3aresponse surface methodology 3awastewater 3awater pollution1 aZhou, Weiming1 aLawan, Ibrahim1 aZhang, Mingxi1 aYuan, Zhanhui0 tCellulose.g2019 July, v. 26, no. 10 p.6241-6258dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3871471x0969-02397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10570-019-02531-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02228naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005800148245016900206300001800375520103400393592002801427650004401455650001501499650001501514650001401529650001401543650001901557650001601576700001701592700002701609700002601636773011201662856008201774961001301856852000901869655001201878IND60647017220221118193427.0190614e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064701722DNAL7 a10.1007/s10570-019-02502-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Yongliang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0785-562110aInvestigation of fiber maturity measurement by cross-sectional image analysis and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy on developing and developed upland cottons  ap. 5865-5875.  aCotton fiber maturity is an important fiber physical and quality property that impacts downstream fiber processing. Fiber maturity refers to the degree of secondary cell wall thickening. The reference method for fiber maturity measurement is to quantify the secondary cell wall area relative to the perimeter of the fiber via cross-sectional image analysis, a tedious and slow process. A number of approaches have been developed which attempt to measure fiber maturity rapidly. The approach employed in this work is based on the use of attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and simple algorithms were developed from the spectra to estimate fiber maturity directly. To validate the efficacy of this approach against cross-sectional image analysis, two distinct fiber sets were examined that included a set of developing fibers and a diverse set of developed fibers. Comparison of image analysis and infrared maturity results imply a consistency and equivalency between the two maturity measurements.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aalgorithms 3acell walls 3acellulose 3ahighlands 3aimage analysis 3alint cotton1 aKim, Hee-Jin1 aDelhom, Christopher D.1 aThibodeaux, Devron P.0 tCellulose.g2019 July, v. 26, no. 10 p.5865-5875dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3871471x0969-02397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10570-019-02502-03Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02883naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002700189245010900216300001400325520137200339592002801711650002301739650001701762650002501779650001501804650001901819650001701838650002101855650001301876650001401889650000901903650001301912650001401925650002501939653001401964653001001978653002301988653001402011700002702025700006302052773020702115856008202322852000902404655001202413IND60690662020221121135107.0200508e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069066202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jaim.2016.10.0032doi7 aPMC53774752pmcid7 a283024142pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeshpande, Shailesh V.10aEffect of panchakarma and Ayurvedic treatment in postpartum rheumatoid arthritis (amavata): A case study  ap. 42-44.  aDream of a mother is to get involved actively in upbringing of child, which is impeded if she is suffering from painful condition like rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in postpartum phase. It causes physical incapacity and psychological trauma as well. Present case is a patient who developed RA one month after full term delivery by caesarean section. In view of symptoms, she was diagnosed as case of amavata. She received Ayurvedic treatment – Simhanada guggulu, Pratapalankeshwara rasa, Dashamoola katutraya kashaya and combination of Swarnabhupati rasa, Tapyadi loha, Mahavatavidhvansa, Chopachini (Smilax china), Shunthi (Zinziber officinale) and Guduchi (Tinospora cordifolia) for four months and course of kala basti (medicated enema) along with application of medicated oil (Vishagharbha taila abhyanga) and sudation (bashpa sweda) for ten days. Complete remission was seen after treatment for four months. The patient was free from oral analgesics. RA test titer that was 160 international units per milliliter (IU/ml) before treatment showed marked reduction (28.12 IU/ml) after 75 days of treatment and later dropped in normal range (6.1 IU/ml). Normal milestones were seen in the child receiving breast feeding. Application of Ayurvedic principles showed excellent results in this case where modern medical management options were limited due to lactation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAyurvedic medicine 3aSmilax china 3aTinospora cordifolia 3aanalgesics 3abreast feeding 3acase studies 3acesarean section 3achildren 3alactation 3aoils 3apatients 3aremission 3arheumatoid arthritis 0aArthritis 0aBasti 0aSwarnabhupati rasa 0aRA factor1 aDeshpande, Vaishali S.1 aPotdar, Shraddha S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2877-58550 tJournal of Ayurveda and integrative medicine.g2017 Jan.,  Mar., v. 8, no. 1 p.42-44dElsevier B.V.aTransdisciplinary University, Bangalore and World Ayurveda FoundationwJournal:27111x0975-94767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaim.2016.10.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02860naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245014000156300001800296520135100314592002801665650002701693650001401720650002501734650002501759650002201784650001901806650001301825650002301838650001301861650002201874650002001896650001001916650002001926650001801946650002101964650001701985650001302002650002102015700001502036700001902051700001402070700001802084700001802102700001702120700001302137773010802150856007502258852000902333655001202342IND60532749820221118122923.0160728e20131111xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053274982DNAL7 a10.1021/bm400983a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Xiaoli10aPreparation of Ultrathin, Robust Protein Microcapsules through Template-Mediated Interfacial Reaction between Amine and Catechol Groups  ap. 3861-3869.  aA novel approach to the synthesis of protein microcapsules is developed through template-mediated interfacial reaction. Protein-doped CaCO₃ templates are first synthetized via coprecipitation and then coated with a catechol-containing alginate (AlgDA) layer. Afterward, the templates are exposed to ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid disodium (EDTA) solution to dissolve CaCO₃. During CaCO₃ dissolution, the generated CO₂ gas pushes protein molecules moving to the AlgDA layer, and thereby Michael addition and Schiff base reactions proceed, forming the shell of protein microcapsules. Three kinds of proteins, namely, bovine serum albumin, catalase, and protamine sulfate, are utilized. The shell thickness of microcapsule varies from 25 to 82 nm as the doping amount of protein increased from 2 to 6 mg per 66 mg CaCO₃. The protein microcapsules have a robust but flexible shell and can be reversibly deformed upon exposure to osmotic pressure. The bioactivity of protein microcapsules is demonstrated through enzymatic catalysis experiments. The protein microcapsules remain about 80% enzymatic activity of the equivalent free protein. Hopefully, our approach could be extended to many other applications such as drug/gene delivery, tissue scaffolds, and catalysis due to the universality of Michael reaction and Schiff base reactions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEDTA (chelating agent) 3aalginates 3abioactive properties 3abovine serum albumin 3acalcium carbonate 3acarbon dioxide 3acatalase 3acatalytic activity 3acatechol 3achemical elements 3acoprecipitation 3adrugs 3aenzyme activity 3agene transfer 3aosmotic pressure 3aschiff bases 3asulfates 3atissue scaffolds1 aShi, Jiafu1 aJiang, Zhongyi1 aLi, Zheng1 aZhang, Wenyan1 aSong, Xiaokai1 aAi, Qinghong1 aWu, Hong0 tBiomacromolecules.g2013 Nov. 11, v. 14, no. 11 p.3861-3869dAmerican Chemical Societyx1526-46027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fbm400983a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02972naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245011300168500002200281520175100303592002802054650001502082650001002097650001202107650001602119650002602135650001402161650001402175650001902189650001202208651000902220653002702229653002302256653002202279653002202301653003002323700002002353700001902373773006502392856008402457852000902541655001202550IND60582243020221121230026.0171005s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058224302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.sedgeo.2017.09.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJoeckel, R.M.10aLower Cretaceous paleo-Vertisols and sedimentary interrelationships in stacked alluvial sequences, Utah, USA  aPre-press version  aThe Yellow Cat Member of the Cedar Mountain Formation in Poison Strip, Utah, USA, consists of stacked, erosionally bounded alluvial sequences dominated by massive mudstones (lithofacies Fm) with paleo-Vertisols. Sediment bodies within these sequences grade vertically and laterally into each other at pedogenic boundaries, across which color, texture, and structures (sedimentary vs. pedogenic) change. Slickensides, unfilled (sealed) cracks, carbonate-filled cracks, and deeper cracks filled with sandstone; the latter features suggest thorough desiccation during aridification. Thin sandstones (Sms) in some sequences, typically as well as laminated to massive mudstones (Flm) with which they are interbedded in some cases, are interpreted as avulsion deposits. The termini of many beds of these lithofacies curve upward, parallel to nearby pedogenic slickensides, as the features we call “turnups.” Turnups are overlain or surrounded by paleosols, but strata sheltered underneath beds with turnups retain primary sedimentary fabrics. Turnups were produced by movement along slickensides during pedogenesis, by differential compaction alongside pre-existing gilgai microhighs, or by a combination of both. Palustrine carbonates (lithofacies C) appear only in the highest or next-highest alluvial sequences, along with a deep paleo-Vertisol that exhibits partially preserved microrelief at the base of the overlying Poison Strip Member. The attributes of the Yellow Cat Member suggest comparatively low accommodation, slow accumulation, long hiatuses in clastic sedimentation, and substantial time intervals of subaerial exposure and pedogenesis; it appears to be distinct among the members of the Cedar Mountain Formation in these respects.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbonates 3acolor 3afabrics 3amicrorelief 3apaleosolic soil types 3asandstone 3asediments 3asoil formation 3atexture 3aUtah 0aPedogenic slickensides 0agilgai microrelief 0acarbonate nodules 0aavulsion deposits 0asoft-sediment deformation1 aLudvigson, G.A.1 aKirkland, J.I.0 tSedimentary geology.g2017, dElsevier B.V.x0037-07387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sedgeo.2017.09.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02808naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150242016400171245014500335300001800480520100200498592002801500650001301528650001501541650002001556650001501576650003301591650000901624650000901633650001201642650002101654650001801675651001201693653001501705653002501720653001301745653002501758653002501783653004901808653001301857653001501870653002101885653000901906653002401915653005801939653001201997700002202009700001902031773012302050856008402173852000902257655001202266IND60122840020221120024933.0150325e20131001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012284002DNAL7 a10.1080/02626667.2013.8240902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalhi, Chahrazed10aLes réseaux de neurones et la régression multiple en prédiction de l’érosion spécifique: cas du bassin hydrographique Algérois-Hodna-Soummam (Algérie)10aNeural networks and multiple regression approaches in the prediction of specific erosion: case of the Algérois-Hodna-Soummam basin, Algeria  ap. 1573-1580.  aPredicting specific erosion at the basin scale is essential in order to help prevent or forecast soil loss problems, water-quality degradation and the impairment of riparian ecosystems. In this study, models were defined to predict specific erosion of an ungauged basin according to hydromorphometric parameters, climatic parameters and vegetation cover, at the sites of dams and small dams in a highly eroded basin, the Algérois-Hodna-Soummam. The governing characteristics were carefully selected based on literature survey, examined and grouped into two zones by principal component analysis. Two methods were used: multiple regression and static neural networks. Very satisfactory results were obtained in testing the validity of the neural networks model by cross-validation—the model being composed of: average annual flow, drainage density, average slope of basin, and average annual rainfall in the input layer—with a determination coefficient of 0.81 and a mean square error of 0.19.  aPublisher supplied data 3adrainage 3aecosystems 3aneural networks 3aprediction 3aprincipal component analysis 3arain 3asoil 3asurveys 3avegetation cover 3awater quality 3aAlgeria 0aprévision 0aérosion spécifique 0abarrages 0arégression multiple 0aréseaux de neurones 0abassin versant Algérois-Hodna-Soummam (AHS) 0aAlgérie 0aprediction 0aspecific erosion 0adams 0amultiple regression 0aneural networks, Algérois-Hodna-Soummam (AHS) basin; 0aAlgeria1 aTouaibia, Bénina1 aZeroual, Ayoub0 tHydrological sciences journal.g2013 Oct. 1, v. 58, no. 7 p.1573-1580dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2013x2150-34357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02626667.2013.8240903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01829naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100006500152245007500217300001600292520069400308592002801002650001201030650001801042650001801060650001101078650001501089650003101104650001701135650001601152650000901168653000901177653003101186653001701217700002501234773010001259856008701359852000901446655001201455IND60542374920221119031917.0190402e20150601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054237492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2014.12.0862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKucheryavskiy, Sergey1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3145-724410aMonitoring of whey quality with NIR spectroscopy—A feasibility study  ap. 271-277.  aThe possibility of using near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy for monitoring of liquid whey quality parameters during protein production process has been tested.

We investigated irisin immunoreactivity in various tissues of the dwarf hamsters (Phodopus roborovskii). Tissues were processed, embedded in paraffin, sectioned at 5 μm and stained immunohistochemically for irisin. In the retina, irisin was found almost all layers, except outer nuclear layer. Also, irisin immunoreactivity was observed in the skin, cornea, striated muscle, parotid gland, tongue, oesophagus, stomach and small intestine. The findings from this study support the notion that skeletal muscle is not the primary source of irisin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhodopus 3acornea 3aesophagus 3aexercise 3aglucose tolerance 3ahamsters 3aheart 3aimmunohistochemistry 3amuscles 3amyocytes 3aparotid gland 3aretina 3askeletal muscle 3asmall intestine 3astomach 3atongue 3aweight loss 3awhite adipose tissue1 aTimurkaan, S.1 aGençer Tarakçi, B.1 aYalçin, M.

The effects of a transmethylase inhibitor, sinefungin, and of the ornithine decarboxylase inhibitor, DL-alpha-difluoromethylornithine (Ornidyl; DFMO), on methionine metabolism were also observed. Trypanosomes rapidly incorporated [35S]methionine into S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) and the metabolites methylthioadenosine, S-adenosylhomocysteine, homocysteine, cystathionine cysteine and glutathione. Untreated trypanosomes excreted large quantities of cystathionine and cysteine into the growth medium. DFMO-treated cells formed larger quantities of AdoMet more rapidly than did control cells, as was evident from initial time points (30 min and 1 h). Decarboxylated AdoMet, present in trace quantities in control cells, accumulated in DFMO-treated cells. Sinefungin increased the AdoMet concentrations approximately 20-fold over that of controls after a 6 h incubation with [35S]methionine, while cystathionine and cysteine levels decreased. The half-life (t1/2) and rate of turnover of AdoMet were measured in cells treated with DFMO or sinefungin. DFMO treatment caused a substantial increase in the rate of AdoMet utilization, while sinefungin extended the t1/2 and lowered AdoMet turnover. These studies show that trypanosomes rapidly metabolize methionine through AdoMet to intermediates of the polyamine and transmethylation pathways. Agents inhibiting these pathways rapidly affect the concentration and rate of utilization of AdoMet, significantly changing the concentrations of metabolites. 3aTrypanosoma brucei 3amethionine 3aamino acid metabolism 3aisotope labeling 3aadenosylmethionine 3ametabolic inhibitors1 aGoldberg, B.1 aGarofalo-Hannan, J.1 aRattendi, D.1 aLyte, P.1 aYarlett, N.0 tBiochemical journal.g1995 Aug. 1, v. 309, no. pt.3 p.737-743aBiochemical journal (London, England : 1984)x0264-60217nnas  aDNAL  a19951002b19951006c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle01986naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002600092040001800118100002000136245016600156300001600322500001500338520073200353650001501085650002901100650003601129650002301165650001501188650000701203650001101210650001301221650002001234650001701254650001101271653001701282653001001299700001501309700001801324700001501342773012901357852000901486930003301495945001301528946001101541655001201552IND2053092420221121060228.0960918e19960601enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205309242DNAL7 ano direct match2pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAndralojc, P.J.10a2-Carboxyarabinitol 1-phosphate (CA1P) formation through a phosphate exchange reaction catalysed by the CA1P phosphatase from French bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.)  ap. 389-393.  a2019-12-05  aTransfer of the phosphate group of 2-carboxy-D-arabinitol 1-phosphate (CA1P) to 14C-labelled 2-carboxy-D-arabinitol (CA) was catalysed by extracts from leaves of Phaseolus vulgaris.

A Vmax of 1.5 micromol/min per mg of protein and a Km (for CA) of 1.8 mM were estimated for the exchange reaction, with the purified phosphatase. 2-Carboxy-D-arabinitol 1,5-bisphosphate and 2-carboxy-D-ribitol 1,5-bisphosphate, but not D-ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate, could replace CA1P as phosphate donor to [14C]CA. 3aarabinitol 3aribulose 1,5-diphosphate 3aphosphoric monoester hydrolases 3aPhaseolus vulgaris 3aphosphates 3apH 3asodium 3akinetics 3aenzyme activity 3atransferases 3aleaves 0apurification 0asalts1 aRyan, J.E.1 aParry, M.A.J.1 aKeys, A.J.0 tBiochemical journal.g1996 June 1, v. 316, no. pt.2 p.389-393aBiochemical journal (London, England : 1984)x0264-60217nnas  aDNAL  a19961101b19961107c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle02474naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120100002300138245011500161300001800276520128800294650002001582650002501602650001301627650001201640650001201652650001801664650003201682650002101714650002301735700002101758700002201779700002301801773014301824852000901967856007801976930003302054946001302087655001202100IND4425003520221121050702.0090821e20090915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442500352DNAL7 a10.1002/polb.217802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRohindra, David R.10aBehavior of pressure dependence of melting temperatures in aromatic polyesters: Influence of polymer structure  ap. 1799-1808.  aThe thermal behavior of three aromatic polyesters in a homologous series, poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), poly(trimethylene terephthalate) (PTT), and poly(butylene terephthalate) (PBT) was studied under hydrostatic pressure up to 200 MPa by using a high pressure differential thermal analysis apparatus. Confining fluid high pressure dilatometer was used to establish the volume-temperature curves (in both solid and liquid regions) from which volume change on melting of these polyesters at atmospheric pressure was determined. Single endothermic peak was seen for PET and PTT, whereas PBT showed double peaks above 50 MPa. Pressure coefficient of melting temperature at atmospheric pressure (dTm/dp₍₀₎), was obtained from the quadratic fit. The dTm/dp₍₀₎ for PTT was newly determined to be 0.445 KMPa⁻¹, whereas for PET and PBT were 0.503 and 0.455 KMPa⁻¹, respectively, comparable to reported values. The dTm/dp₍₀₎ exhibited the odd-even behavior corresponding to odd and even number of methylene groups in the repeat unit. Enthalpy and entropy of fusion had the most influence on this coefficient. Entropy related to conformational and volume change were evaluated and the former was found to have a significant impact on the value of dTm/dp₍₀₎. 3aair temperature 3aatmospheric pressure 3aenthalpy 3aentropy 3amelting 3amelting point 3apolyethylene terephthalates 3athermal analysis 3athermal properties1 aTanaka, Masakazu1 aKuboyama, Keiichi1 aOugizawa, Toshiaki0 tJournal of polymer science.g2009 Sept. 15, v. 47, no. 18 p.1799-1808dWiley Subscription Services, Inc., A Wiley Companyx0887-62667nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/polb.217803Available from publisher's Web site  a20090821b00000000c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02078naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245014100163300001600304520089700320650001001217650002001227650001001247650001101257650004301268650001501311650001901326700001601345700001701361700001601378700001501394700001301409700001501422700002101437773012701458852000901585856008501594946001301679655001201692IND4439793920221121050749.0100709e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443979392DNAL7 a10.1007/s11626-010-9318-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Youwei 10aEvaluation of suitable reference gene for real-time PCR in human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells with long-term in vitro expansion  ap. 595-599.  aIn real-time quantitative PCR, the accuracy of normalized data is highly dependent on the stability of the reference genes. However, reference gene expression in a given cell type or experimental condition can vary considerably. The goal of this study was to establish a reliable set of reference genes for real-time PCR studies using human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells with long-term in vitro expansion. The stability of ten potential reference genes was examined in human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells. We found that Ywhaz and Rpl13a, not beta-actin or Gapdh, were the most stably expressed of the internal control genes in different passages of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells. Ywhaz and Rpl13a could be used as reference genes for relative gene quantification and normalization purposes in real-time PCR studies of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells. 3aactin 3agene expression 3agenes 3ahumans 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3astem cells 3aumbilical cord1 aHan, Zhibo 1 aYan, Shulin 1 aMao, Aibin 1 aWang, Bin 1 aRen, He 1 aChi, Ying 1 aHan, Zhong Chao.0 tIn vitro cellular & developmental biology.g2010 July, v. 46, no. 7 p.595-599dNew York : Springer-Verlagx1071-26907nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11626-010-9318-y3Available from publisher's Web site  aOther US 7aarticle02748naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100001600135245013300151246013800284300001800422500002300440500001500463520167200478650001302150651001202163651001102175700001802186773010202204852000902306856007502315939003302390946001102423655001202434IND8400058120221121025441.0840106e198310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND840005812DNAL7 a10.1139/b83-2952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCoxon, D.S.14aThe pattern of in situ summer nitrogenase activity in terrestrial Nostoc commune from Stipa-Bouteloa grassland, southern Alberta3 aPattern of in situ summer nitrogenase activity in terrestrial Nostoc commune from Stipa-Bouteloa grassland, southern Alberta [Canada]  ap. 2686-2693.  aSummary in French.  a2019-12-05  aField rates of nitrogenase activity by N. commune were followed over a 1-month summer period in Stipa–Bouteloa grassland of southern Alberta, using repeated short-term acetylene-reduction assays. Concurrent patterns of temperature, moisture, and light at the soil surface were continuously monitored. There is a rapid response of nitrogenase activity to both small precipitation events and dewfall hydration periods. Typically, thalli wet by thundershower activity in the previous evening showed a midday maximum of acetylene reduction of up to 5 nmol C2H4 mg−1 h−1, followed by a rapid cessation of activity as thalli desiccated below critical moisture levels. Over extended precipitation periods rates continue to climb throughout the day, gradually falling over the night period. Dry thalli frequently experience surface temperatures of up to 65 °C, without any discernable effects on rehydration recovery of nitrogenase activity. Equally, ground frosts early in the study period did not affect subsequent activity. Surface densities of up to 23.9 g m−2 were found for N. commune, with a mean cover of 4.3 g m−2. Mean cumulative nitrogen fixation over the 31-day field period was estimated to be 10.0 mg N m−2, although up to 77.3 mg N m−2 might be expected in localized microsites. The utilization of small rainfall events in large part accounts for the magnitude of observed nitrogenase activity. Although subsequent losses of fixed nitrogen through denitrification and volatilization are yet unknown, a significant proportion of nitrogen input to this grassland site must originate from asymbiotic biological fixation. 3aprairies 3aAlberta 0aCanada1 aKershaw, K.A.0 tCanadian journal of botany.g1983 Oct., v. 61, no. 10 p.2686-2693wJournal:19148x0008-40267nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/b83-2953Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b19840106c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03741naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245018400170300001600354520211600370650002202486650003602508650001102544650001802555650001702573650001302590650001902603650001702622650001902639650001902658650002702677650002802704650001502732650001402747650001602761650002202777650003302799650001302832650001702845650001402862650001602876650001302892650001102905650001202916700001702928700001602945700001902961773017102980856005103151852000903202655001203211IND60565162420221120233039.0170320e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056516242DNAL7 a10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-16-2292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSibomana, M.

Nemo-Netta) in a South African Supply Chain  ap. 345-354.  aPostharvest microbial spoilage due to suboptimal transportation and packaging conditions is a key concern for the South African tomato industry. This study investigated the influence of washing with tap water or aqueous disinfectant solutions (chlorinated and anolyte water) on the microbiological quality of tomatoes during storage after transportation in nonrefrigerated trucks along two supply routes when packaged in crates and boxes. Route 1 was 1,093 km from field to storage site, while route 2 was 1,057 km. During transport, the temperature in the trucks fluctuated between 16 and 28°C and the relative humidity between 25 and 94% for route 1, while for route 2, the temperature was between 16 and 30°C and the relative humidity between 28 and 71%. Tomatoes at the pink maturity stage were sampled, treated, and stored for 28 days (11°C). The tomato firmness before treatment was 24.8 N (box samples) and 17.4 N (crate samples) for route 1, whereas it was 22.1 N (box samples) and 20.2 N (crate samples) for route 2. Temperature fluctuation during transportation led to water condensation on tomato surfaces. Tomatoes treated with anolyte water showed the lowest microbial surface burden during storage, with mean aerobic plate counts (APC) of 2.9 log CFU/cm2, coliform counts (CC) of 1.1 log CFU/cm2, and fungal counts (FC) of 2.3 log CFU/cm2. Overall, of the total APC recorded during storage, anolyte-treated samples contributed 9% while chlorinated water–treated samples contributed 30%. Of the total CC, anolyte samples presented 3% while chlorinated water samples made up 12%, and of the total recorded FC, anolyte samples contributed 7% while chlorinated water samples made up 22%. Scanning electron microscopy imaging showed surface cracks, which enable microbial colonization in crate-transported tomatoes. A combination of anolyte treatment and box packaging during transport resulted in the best microbiological quality during storage. The findings of this investigation provide motivation for the adoption of anolyte water as a postharvest disinfection treatment in the tomato industry 3acoliform bacteria 3acondensation (phase transition) 3acrates 3adisinfectants 3adisinfection 3afirmness 3afood transport 3afresh market 3aimage analysis 3amaturity stage 3amicrobial colonization 3amicrobiological quality 3amotivation 3apackaging 3aplate count 3arelative humidity 3ascanning electron microscopy 3aspoilage 3asupply chain 3atap water 3atemperature 3atomatoes 3atrucks 3awashing1 aZiena, L.

The total lipids (11 +/- 3% fresh weight, muscle) consisted of 94% neutral lipids and 5% phospholipids. Sixty-seven fatty acids and dimethylacetals were detected in the total lipids, the principal acids being 18:1 omega 9 +/- omega 7 (41.0 +/- 1.7%), 16:0 (24.2 +/- 1.2%), 18.2 omega 6 (9.1 +/- 0.5%), 16:1 omega 7 (8.9 +/- 0.7%), 18:0 (7.7 +/- 0.5%) and 14:0 (3.2 +/- 0.5%). The neutral lipids exhibited a similar profile. The phospholipids had a higher proportion of polyunsaturated fatty acids, the major components being 18:1 omega 9 + omega 7 (17.5 +/- 1.8%), 16:0 (16.7 +/- 2.0%), 20:4 omega 6 (11.6 +/- 1.3%), 22:6 omega 3 (11.0 +/- 1.3%), 18:2 omega 6 (9.1 +/- 0.7%), 18:0 (8.9 +/- 1.1%), 22:5 omega 6 (5.8 +/- 0.7%). No definite trend was seen in relation to season (water temperature, 7-26 degrees C).

Salt treatment (100 mM, 6 days) significantly increased the proline content of shoots but this appeared to be a reaction to stress damage and not associated with salt tolerance, because proline contents were higher in the more sensitive cultivars. Besides proline, some other free amino acids also accumulated leading to a significant increase in the total amino acid content of the stressed seedlings. High levels of free ammonium also accumulated under conditions of stress; this was highly correlated with the accumulation of Na+ in the shoots and negatively correlated with salt tolerance. The accumulation of ammonium was positively correlated with the accumulation of many free amino acids, and also associated with the production of urea in the stressed seedlings. Results from the present investigations suggest that an increase in the concentration of some free amino acids including proline, may be a result of the reassimilation of the stress-induced ammonium. A high capacity to assimilate ammonium may be an important factor in alleviating the consequence of stress because ammonium can be toxic at high concentrations. 3aOryza sativa 3arice 3agrain crops 3acultivars 3aseedlings 3ashoots 3aplant response 3asalt tolerance 3anitrogen 3afree amino acids 3aproline 3aammonium compounds 3aurea 3asodium 3abioaccumulation 3asalt stress 3asodium chloride1 aShim, I.S.1 aKobayashi, K.1 aKenji, U.0 tPlant growth regulation.g2003 Oct., v. 41, no. 2 p.159-164dKluwer Academic Publishersx0167-69037nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.kluweronline.com/issn/0167-6903/contents3electronic resource  aINDdRSCe2004/05/04  aNon-US 7aarticle03327naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072000900110072000900119100001300128245010600141300001600247500002400263500001500287520186400302650003002166650001202196650001902208650000902227650001402236650001602250650001702266650001102283650001202294650001802306650001402324650001302338650001702351650002202368650001802390650002302408653002002431653002802451653001802479653001802497700001402515700001302529700001202542773010902554852000902663856007702672945002502749946001102774655001202785IND4361991520221120213201.0040409e200311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436199152DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aF2001 aYang, J.10aHormones in the grains in relation to sink strength and postanthesis development of spikelets in rice  ap. 185-195.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aInferior spikelets usually exhibit a slower grain filling rate and lower grain weight than superior spikelets in a rice (Oryza sativa L.) panicle. This study investigated whether the variations in grain filling between the two kinds of spikelets were attributed to their sink strength and whether the sink strength was regulated by the hormonal levels in the grains. Using two field-grown rice genotypes, the division rate of endosperm cells, hormonal levels in the grains, and grain weight of both superior and inferior spikelets were determined during the grain filling period. The results showed that superior spikelets had dominance over inferior spikelets in endosperm cell division rate and cell number, grain filling and grain weight. Changes in zeatin (Z) and zeatin riboside (ZR) contents paralleled and were very significantly correlated with the cell division rate and cell number. Cell division rate and the content of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) in the grains were also significantly correlated. Gibberellin (GAs; GA1+ GA4) content of the grains was high but ABA levels were low at the early grain filling stage. ABA increased substantially during the linear phase of grain growth and was very significantly correlated with grain dry weight during this period. Application of kinetin at 2 through 6 days post anthesis (DPA) significantly increased cell number, while spraying ABA at 11 through 15 DPA significantly increased the grain filling rate. The results suggest that differences in sink strength are responsible for variations in grain filling between superior and inferior spikelets. Both cytokinins and IAA in the grains may mediate cell division in rice endosperm at early grain filling stages, and therefore regulate the sink size of the grain, whereas ABA content correlates with sink activity during the linear period of grain growth. 3asource-sink relationships 3akinetin 3ainflorescences 3arice 3aflowering 3agrain crops 3aOryza sativa 3azeatin 3asucrose 3acell division 3aendosperm 3agenotype 3agibberellins 3agenetic variation 3aabscisic acid 3aindole acetic acid 0azeatin riboside 0aplant growth substances 0acarbohydrates 0asink strength1 aZhang, J.1 aWang, Z.1 aZhu, Q.0 tPlant growth regulation.g2003 Nov., v. 41, no. 3 p.185-195dKluwer Academic Publishersx0167-69037nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.kluweronline.com/issn/0167-6903/contents3electronic resource  aINDdRSCe2004/05/03  aNon-US 7aarticle02522naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072000900110072000900119100001500128245009700143300001600240500002400256520122200280650002001502650001901522650001101541650002001552650002001572650002101592650001001613650003101623650002901654650002501683650002101708650001001729650001801739650002501757650002201782700001401804700001501818773010901833852000901942856007701951945002502028946001102053655001202064IND4361980520221120202457.0040408e200402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436198052DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aF2001 aWang, S.J.10aCircadian control of sweet potato granule-bound starch synthase I gene in Arabidopsis plants  ap. 161-168.  aIncludes references  aA starch granule-bound starch synthase I (GBSSI) gene is regulated by a circadian clock in sweet potato leaves. In order to examine whether the promoter region is responsible for controlling a circadian expression of the GBSSI gene, the sweet potato GBSSI promoter was isolated and deleted to different lengths for functional analysis with a GUS reporter gene in transgenic Arabidopsis plants. Nuclear run-on transcriptional assays showed that the circadian control was regulated at the transcriptional rate level, and de novo synthesized proteins were necessary for controlling the rhythm. Promoter assays showed that the GBSSI promoter fragments containing six I-boxes, two putative circadian regulation elements (CAANNNNATC) and four circadian clock-associated 1 protein-binding sites (AATCT) maintained the activity to induce the circadian expression of the GUS gene. Similar to the GBSSI in sweet potato, GBSSI, soluble starch synthase and ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase genes in Arabidopsis leaves also exhibited a circadian rhythm. These results suggested that common signals may exist in dicotyledonous plants to coordinate the circadian expression of genes involved in the transitory starch synthetic pathway. 3aIpomoea batatas 3asweet potatoes 3aleaves 3astarch synthase 3aenzyme activity 3apromoter regions 3agenes 3agene expression regulation 3atranscription (genetics) 3agenetic transduction 3acircadian rhythm 3alight 3agene transfer 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3atransgenic plants1 aYeh, K.W.1 aTsai, C.Y.0 tPlant growth regulation.g2004 Feb., v. 42, no. 2 p.161-168dKluwer Academic Publishersx0167-69037nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.kluweronline.com/issn/0167-6903/contents3electronic resource  aINDdMKSe2004/04/23  aNon-US 7aarticle01914naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002600110245013900136300001600275500001500291520075300306650001701059650002601076650001001102650001501112650002301127650003801150650001301188650001401201653001601215653001801231653001601249700001401265700001401279700001801293700001901311773010801330852000901438930003301447945001301480946001101493655001201504IND2048301820221120192242.0951018e199410  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204830182DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOliveira, T.C.R.M. de12aA simple and rapid antibody-capture ELISA for the detection of staphylococcal enterotoxin A in food including a simple extraction step  ap. 563-573.  a2019-12-05  aA sensitive and precise ELISA for the detection of staphylococcal enterotoxin A in food has been developed, using specific IgG anti-toxin antibodies purified from immunized rabbits. An antibody capture format was found to be the most useful following cross-reaction and sensitivity studies. The ELISA was used to investigate concentration of staphylococcal enterotoxin A from food samples by polyethylene glycol dialysis. The procedure was shown to be inefficient and highly variable, as well as time-consuming. Direct analysis of aqueous food extracts without a concentration step was found to be possible. With an assay time of 140 min, the ELISA detection limit was 12.5 pg of toxin (corresponding to a sensitivity of 0.5 ng g-1 of food sample). 3aenterotoxins 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3afoods 3aantibodies 3afood contamination 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aextracts 3adetection 0amethodology 0aconcentration 0afood safety1 aLee, H.A.1 aWyatt, G.1 aHirooka, E.Y.1 aMorgan, M.R.A.0 tInternational journal of food science & technology.g1994 Oct., v. 29, no. 5 p.563-573x0950-54237nnas  aDNAL  a19951102b19951108c00000000  aINDdRAM  aNon-US 7aarticle03037naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100001500161245015700176300001600333500002400349500002300373500001500396520125700411650004501668650000901713650001801722650002801740650001201768650002101780650001701801650001701818650003501835650001501870650001701885650001901902650002001921650002201941650002801963650001001991653001002001653002502011700001302036700001102049700001202060700001202072700001402084700001602098700001102114773014102125852000902266856009102275930003302366945002502399946001102424655001202435IND4383184420221120192201.0060828e200512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438318442DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

So these three genes were considered as the candidate genes that have the effect on porcine production and immune traits in this study. Genetic variations of these three genes were investigated and the single nucleotide polymorphism-based (SNPs-based) association analyses were studied initially. The polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) revealed that there is a MvaI polymorphic site in intron3 of PSMC3 gene and a MboI polymorphic site within intron 5 of PSMC6 gene, as well as a RsaI polymorphic site within exon 10 of the PSMD3 gene. chi2 analysis presented that allele frequencies differed among four breeds (Meishan, Erhualian, Qingping pig and Duroc) at PSMC3 and PSMD3 loci (P < 0.01). Association analysis showed that the PSMC3 gene has an effect on average backfat thickness (P < 0.01), total erythrocytes (P < 0.01) and hematocrit (P < 0.01), and there is a significant association between the PSMD3 genotypes and the mean corpuscular volume. PSMC6 has no effect on the production and immune traits we studied. 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3apork 3aanimal growth 3acarcass characteristics 3aalleles 3aprotein subunits 3aswine breeds 3ameat quality 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3ahematocrit 3aerythrocytes 3agene frequency 3aimmune response 3agenetic variation 3aadenosinetriphosphatase 3aswine 0agenes 0agenetic polymorphism1 aYang, J.1 aYu, M.1 aLiu, B.1 aFan, B.1 aZhu, M.J.1 aXiong, T.A.1 aLi, K.0 tCanadian journal of animal science.g2005 Dec., v. 85, no. 4 p.475-480dAgricultural Institute of Canada.wJournal:1932x0008-39847nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://pubs.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/aic-journals/cjas.html3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080205b20080301c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/10/12  aNon-US 7aarticle02298naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001300110245009200123300001600215520089700231650001301128650001601141650001801157650001601175650002501191650001701216650001701233650001601250650001301266650000701279650001601286650002001302650002401322650001601346650002301362650001101385650001301396650001201409650002001421653002001441653001101461653001901472653002601491700001601517700001701533700001901550700001301569773010801582852000901690930003301699945001301732946001101745655001201756IND2048920320221120192237.0951124e199412  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204892032DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNaes, H.10aAccelerated ripening of dry fermented sausage by addition of a Lactobacillus proteinase  ap. 651-659.  aAccelerated ripening of dry sausage was investigated by adding two different concentrations of proteinase isolated from Lactobacillus paracasei ssp. paracasei NCDO151 to sausage mixtures. Sausages with proteinase showed a greater pH decrease and a greater increase in lactic acid formation, water loss, protein degradation and peptide formation than control, no enzyme, sausages. Changes were most pronounced in the sausages containing 12Ug-1 proteinase. Addition of proteinase caused a specific increase in glutamate, serine and lysine content. Sensory evaluation after 14 days of ripening showed a significant increase in flavour intensity, maturity flavour, acidity, bitter taste and hardness in the proteinase-containing sausages. Addition of proteinase induced changes earlier in the fermentation and ripening period than in the control, thereby indicating an acceleration of maturation. 3asausages 3adried foods 3aLactobacillus 3aproteinases 3aaccelerated ripening 3afermentation 3afood storage 3atemperature 3aduration 3apH 3alactic acid 3aanimal proteins 3aprotein degradation 3aamino acids 3asensory evaluation 3aflavor 3ahardness 3atexture 3aenzyme activity 0awater relations 0atastes 0aripening stage 0afermentation products1 aHolck, A.L.1 aAxelsson, L.1 aAndersen, H.J.1 aBlom, H.0 tInternational journal of food science & technology.g1994 Dec., v. 29, no. 6 p.651-659x0950-54237nnas  aDNAL  a19960102b19960111c00000000  aINDdRAM  aNon-US 7aarticle02151naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245007900125300001600204520115600220650000901376650000901385650000901394650002001403650002601423650002101449650002101470650002101491650001401512650001501526650001601541650001301557653001301570700001701583773009701600852000901697930003301706945001301739946001301752655001201765IND2054100220221120181220.0961119e199606  flu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205410022DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHong, J.H.10aNear-infrared spectroscopic analysis of heme and nonheme iron in raw meats  ap. 127-134.  aNear-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy scanning from 1100 to 2500 nm was applied for the determinations of heme and nonheme iron in raw muscle meats. Ground meat samples were divided into two sets of 30 and 15 samples as a calibration and a prediction set, respectively. The multiple regression equations (MREs) established for the calibration set between the chemical analysis reference data and the second derivative data of the NIR spectra gave the multiple correlation coefficients of 0.966 and 0.923 for heme and nonheme iron contents, respectively. The best MREs were obtained with the NIR data recorded at wavelengths where NH groups in protein molecules and C-C and CH in the porphyrin ring of heme give absorption. The correlation coefficients between the data calculated from these MREs and the reference data for the prediction set were 0.991 and 0.906 for heme and nonheme iron contents, respectively. The results indicate that the NIR diffuse reflectance procedure is a technique which serves the need for rapid and simple heme and nonheme iron determinations. thereby allowing an in vitro estimation of bioavailability of iron in muscle meats. 3ameat 3airon 3aheme 3amineral content 3ainfrared spectroscopy 3anutrient content 3afood composition 3adietary minerals 3araw foods 3aprediction 3acalibration 3aaccuracy 0arecovery1 aYasumoto, K.0 tSubtropical plant science.g1996 June, v. 9, no. 2 p.127-134wJournal:20855x0485-20447nnas  aDNAL  a19961202b19961205c00000000  aINDdHBI  aOther US 7aarticle02043naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245007900129300001600208500001500224520090900239650002001148650001501168650001601183650001501199650002301214650002001237650002101257650002101278653000901299653002201308653001601330653001101346653001701357653002001374653002601394700001701420773011601437852000901553930003301562945001301595946001301608655001201621IND2056214620221120181257.0970328e199609  flu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205621462DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPetersen, B.J.10aAssessing the intake of contaminants and nutrients: an overview of methods  ap. 243-254.  a2019-12-05  aThe methods being applied to assess the intake of food contaminants or nutrients from one or more foods are reviewed and their advantages and disadvantages are discussed. Methods currently being used for estimating the joint intake of food contaminants or nutrients from several foods depend on the data and resources available. Ideally, the methods should account for the fact that individuals eat a variety of foods in a single day and do not necessarily consume the same foods every day. Similarly, the methods should adjust for the large variability that exists in the amount of food consumed by various individuals or on various days and in the food combinations consumed by different individuals or on different days. Finally, the methods should also adjust for the fact that food contaminants and nutrients are often present in more than one food and are usually present at varying concentrations. 3anutrient intake 3aestimation 3afood intake 3amonitoring 3afood contamination 3adata collection 3aTotal Diet Study 3afood consumption 0adiet 0aduplicate methods 0amethodology 0aintake 0acontaminants 0adietary surveys 0amarket basket methods1 aBarraj, L.M.0 tJournal of food composition and analysis.g1996 Sept., v. 9, no. 3 p.243-254wJournal:jnl42192x0889-15757nnas  aDNAL  a19970501b19970508c00000000  aINDdHBI  aOther US 7aarticle01041naa a2200253 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002200110245006400132300001400196500014500210520013200355650001100487650001800498650001800516650002000534650001900554773014300573856005000716852000900766655001200775IND4511280220221120171003.0150413e20150120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND451128022DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarcia, Ademerval13aTheimportance of citrus for the juice and beverage industry  ap. 49-51.  aPaper presented at the XII International Citrus Congress - International Society of Citriculture, held November 18-23, 2012, Valencia, Spain  aThe present work is a summary of the importance of citrus in the juice industry, and their reverse impact on citrus production. 3aCitrus 3acitrus fruits 3acitrus juices 3acrop production 3ajuice industry0 tActa horticulturae.g2015 Jan. 20, , no. 1065 p.49-51dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/1065/1065_2.htm  aDNAL 7aarticle02203naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245003100128300001400159500014500173520112000318650001001438650001801448650001201466650001301478650001101491650001401502650001201516650001201528650002201540650001301562650001401575650001701589650001101606651001001617773014301627856005001770852000901820655001201829IND4511280120221120033916.0150413e20150120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND451128012DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNavarro, Luis13aTheSpanish citrus industry  ap. 41-48.  aPaper presented at the XII International Citrus Congress - International Society of Citriculture, held November 18-23, 2012, Valencia, Spain  aThe Spanish citrus industry has a long and worldwide known tradition. Citrons (Citrus medica) were introduced by the Romans during the V century, sour oranges (C. aurantium), lemons (C. limon), and pummelos (C. maxima) by the Arabs during the X and XI centuries, sweet oranges (C. sinensis) by Genoese traders during the XV century and a reintroduction of higher quality varieties by the Portuguese in the XVI century and finally, the mandarins (C. reticulate) during the XIX century. Initially citrus were used as ornamental plants and for medicinal purposes, and after the introduction of sweet oranges also for direct consumption at very local scale. Commercial plantings started at the end of the XVIII century and exports of fresh fruit to other European countries were done from this time. Today the Spain has 330.000 ha producing 6.3 million tons. About 50% of the production is exported as fresh fruit, 20% is consumed in the internal market also as fresh fruit, 18% is processed and the rest are wastes. Spain is the fifth production country and the first fresh fruit citrus exporting country in the world. 3aArabs 3aCitrus medica 3aexports 3aindustry 3alemons 3amandarins 3amarkets 3aoranges 3aornamental plants 3apummelos 3araw fruit 3asour oranges 3awastes 3aSpain0 tActa horticulturae.g2015 Jan. 20, , no. 1065 p.41-48dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/1065/1065_1.htm  aDNAL 7aarticle02850naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154100002000163245013100183300001600314500002400330520142400354650001301778650002001791650001701811650002201828650002801850650001401878650001801892650001801910650002101928650002401949650001301973650002201986653002202008700001502030700002302045700001702068700001802085773011802103852000902221856006902230930003302299945002502332946001102357655001202368IND4383207020221120025016.0060829e200606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438320702DNAL7 a10.1017/S00218596060060342doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF120 0aF2001 aAndersson, M.S.10aPhenological, agronomic and forage quality diversity among germplasm accessions of the tropical legume shrub Cratylia argentea  ap. 237-248.  aIncludes references  aCratylia argentea (Desv.) O. Kuntze is a drought-tolerant tropical shrub legume that can help to ensure continuity of forage supply in smallholder systems either through direct grazing or as a cut-and-carry plant for fresh foliage or silage. A collection of 38 accessions was characterized agronomically and nutritionally. High diversity was detected between accessions. Time to flowering ranged from 217-329 days after transplanting seedlings to the field and from 129-202 days after cutting. Flowering is probably induced by reduction of day length. Seed production was high but variable. Dry matter production ranged from 190-382 g/plant in the rainy and from 124-262 g/plant in the dry season, content of in vitro digestible dry matter from 589-690 g/kg, crude protein content from 184-237 g/kg and fibre content from 403-528 g/kg (neutral detergent fibre, NDF), 240-335 g/kg (acid detergent fibre, ADF), and 9-13 g/kg (acid detergent fibre-bound nitrogen, N-ADF). Accessions CIAT 18674 and CIAT 22406 were identified as promising for further study. They were superior to the commercial cultivar in terms of dry matter (DM) production, particularly in the dry season. Further research is required to determine the prevailing reproduction strategy of C. argentea and to quantify outcrossing-rates. Multilocational trials with a selected set of accessions should be conducted under different environmental conditions. 3aCratylia 3acrop production 3acrop quality 3aseed productivity 3adry matter accumulation 3aflowering 3afiber content 3adigestibility 3aagronomic traits 3agermplasm screening 3agenotype 3agenetic variation 0aCratylia argentea1 aPeters, M.1 aSchultze-Kraft, R.1 aFranco, L.H.1 aLascano, C.E.0 tJournal of agricultural science.g2006 June, v. 144, no. 3 p.237-248dCambridge University Pressx0021-85967nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00218596060060343electronic resource  a20060906b20061003c00000000  aINDdMKSe2006/09/06  aNon-US 7aarticle01611naa a2200421 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001600115245009900131300001600230300002400246520043900270650001500709650002400724650001500748650002900763650001900792650002300811650001200834653002100846700001700867700001800884700002100902700001700923700001800940700001700958700001500975700001800990773009301008852001301101939003301114945000801147946001301155852000901168655001201177991615821450742620221117180631.0890918e19890817xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI890015912DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMills, J.L.14aThe absence of a relation between the periconceptional use of vitamins and neural-tube defects  ap. 430-435.  ap. 430-435. charts.  aIn this report, women with infants or fetuses with neural-tube defects, with other abnormalities, and without abnormalities were interviewed within five months of diagnosis or delivery to determine the relation between the use of folate supplements and neural-tube defects.

In Trial 1, at 4, 10 and 20 week of age, 20 calves were treated iv with 2 μg/kg body weight of LHRH 1 and 5 h after commencing a 9-h period of blood sampling. Bulls were separated into early and late maturing (n = 10), based on age at puberty (scrotal circumference (SC) of greater than or equal 28 cm). At 4 and 20 week of age, peak serum LH concentrations and area under the LH response curve in response to LHRH were lower (P < 0.05) in early- versus late-maturing bulls. In Trial 2, calves at 20 week of age were given LHRH as follows: 2 μg/kg body weight iv (n = 6), im (n = 6) or sc (n = 6); 5 μg/kg im (n = 6), or ischio-rectally (ir, n = 6) or sc (n = 6); and 10 μg/kg im (n = 6) or sc (n = 6). Serum LH concentrations were at a plateau from 30 to 165 min after treatment with 5 μg/kg of LHRH (im or ir; P > 0.05). We concluded that the LH responses to LHRH in calves at 4 and 20 week of age could facilitate the development of a simple test (one blood sample prior to treatment with LHRH and a second during the period of sustained response to LHRH) to select early-maturing bulls. 3ahormone secretion 3abulls 3adose response 3agonadotropin-releasing hormone 3apuberty 3aearly development 3aanimal age 3agonadotropin release 3adrug injection 3acalves 3aluteinizing hormone 0aage at puberty 0ainjection route 0ahormonal regulation1 aCook, S.J.1 aHonaramooz, A.1 aAravindakshan, J.P.1 aHuchkowsky, S.1 aRawlings, N.C.0 tTheriogenology.g2006 Sept. 1, v. 66, no. 4 p.937-944dButterworth-Heinemannx0093-691X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2006.02.0343electronic resource  a20070122b20070202c00000000  aINDdNZMe2007/01/22  aOther US 7aarticle01841naa a2200457 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100002300115245009600138300001600234300003000250500001500280520055300295650000900848650000800857650002600865650002800891650002300919650002500942650001400967653001500981700001900996700002301015700002301038700002201061700002201083700001801105700001701123700001801140700002401158700001901182773009401201852001301295939003301308945000801341946001301349852000901362655001201371991615821030742620221117180617.0851001e19850328xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI850078312DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKushi, Lawrence H.10aDiet and 20-year mortality from coronary heart disease: the Ireland-Boston diet-heart study  ap. 811-818.  ap. 811-818. ill., charts.  a2019-12-05  aA prospective study of 1001 middle-aged men initially enrolled in 1 of 3 geographical cohort groups examined possible associations between dietary data obtained about 20 years ago and subsequent coronary heart disease (CHD) mortality.

Ethanol with 20% water and acetone with 30% water were found to dissolve zein well and transform it into a transparent flexible film after moderate drying. Both films showed similar breaking strength to that of commercial thin film of polyvinylidene chloride for food use and were digested with proteases. Only the film prepared from acetone solution showed a relatively low water permeability. This water permeation was found to depend strongly on the rate of diffusion. 1,2-Epoxy-3-chloropropane (ECP) was added into the acetone solution to cross-link the zein molecules for the purpose of improving the breaking strength and water-resistant properties of the film. Alpha-chymotrypsin was found to digest the film even after the modification with ECP. However, this cross-linking resulted in little improvement in the water-resistant properties of the film and also reduced its flexibility. 3afood packaging 3azein 3acorn 3awater 3apermeability 3astarch 3ahydrophobicity 3abiodegradation 3aoxygen 3athickness 0aflexibility 0abreaking strength 0aresistance 0afilms1 aTakahashi, H.1 aNoguchi, A.0 tInternational journal of food science & technology.g1995 Oct., v. 30, no. 5 p.599-608x0950-54237nnas  aDNAL  a19960709b19960712c00000000  aINDdRAM  aNon-US 7aarticle02401naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245015900127300001600286500001500302520098000317650002701297650002301324650002001347650001601367650001401383650002601397650002201423650001101445650002101456650001601477650002401493650001601517650002301533651002101556653001701577653001901594653003401613653002001647653001701667700001801684700001501702700001601717773010801733852000901841930003301850945001301883946001101896655001201907IND2051499120221117163152.0960531e199510  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205149912DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIbanoglu, S.10aEffect of formulation on protein breakdown, in vitro digestibility, rheological properties and acceptibility of tarhana, a traditional Turkish cereal food  ap. 579-585.  a2019-12-05  aThree formulations of tarhana, a traditional Turkish fermented yogurt-wheat mixture used in soups, were prepared in the laboratory.

Replacement of white wheat flour with wholemeal flour and increasing the yogurt had little effect on protein breakdown, but the true- to crude-protein ratio fell slightly during fermentation. Tarhana soups behaved as pseudoplastics (eta < 1) at 80 degrees C, and those with eta values (> 0.8) closer to Newtonian flow (eta = 1) were most liked in mouth feel; however high apparent viscosity and samples with less liked mouth feel were not less liked in overall acceptability than the commercial sample.

The volumetric shrinkage or the water transport response during freezing of sperm cells was obtained using a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) technique. Water transport was obtained in the presence of extracellular ice at a cooling rate of 20 °C/min in two different media: (1) without cryoprotective agents (CPAs), and (2) with 5% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The sperm cell was modeled as a cylinder of length of 22.8 μm and diameter 0.288 μm and was assumed to have an osmotically inactive cell volume (Vb) of 0.6V0, where V0 is the isotonic or initial cell volume. By fitting a model of water transport to the experimentally determined water transport data, the best fit membrane permeability parameters (reference membrane permeability to water, Lpg or Lpg[cpa] and the activation energy, ELp or ELp[cpa]) were determined and ranged from Lpg = 0.011-0.001 μm/min-atm, and ELp = 40.2-9.2 kcal/mol). The parameters obtained in this study suggested that the optimal rate of cooling for striped bass sperm cells in the presence and absence of DMSO range from 14 to 20 °C/min. These theoretically predicted rates of optimally freezing M. saxatilis sperm compared quite closely with independent and experimentally determined optimal rates of cooling striped bass sperm. 3aMorone saxatilis 3abass 3aspermatozoa 3acryopreservation 3afreezing 3acooling 3acryoprotectants 3adimethyl sulfoxide 3aphysiological transport 3amembrane permeability 3aactivation energy 3amathematical models 0asperm water transport1 aCampbell, W.T.1 aVicknair, M.R.1 aTiersch, T.R.1 aDevireddy, R.V.0 tTheriogenology.g2006 Sept. 1, v. 66, no. 4 p.964-973dButterworth-Heinemannx0093-691X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2006.02.0353electronic resource  a20070124b20070202c00000000  aINDdNZMe2007/01/24  aOther US 7aarticle01598naa a2200253 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245005300126300001600179500023100195520061800426650001301044650002501057650001701082650001201099651001601111773014501127856005101272852000901323655001201332IND4511279220221123030343.0150413e20150222xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND451127922DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShowyin, L.10aReview of automatic aerosol insecticide products  ap. 129-130.  aPapers presented at the I International Symposium on Pyrethrum, The Natural Insecticide: Scientific and Industrial Developments in the Renewal of a Traditional Industry, held November 2-4, 2011, Launceston,Tasmania (Australia)  aAutomatic aerosol insecticide was introduced into the New Zealand market during the early 1990s and rapidly expanded into the Australian market.

Antibodies were detected in serum samples of 66.1% of all sows, most frequently serovar icterohaemorrhagiae (43.1%), followed by pomona (18.1%) and tarassovi (9.9%). Seroreactivity to icterohaemorrhagiae and pomona were associated (P < 0.05) with impaired reproductive performance (and substantial economic loss). Seroreactivity for pomona was associated (P < 0.05) with stillborn piglets and mummified fetuses, whereas seroreactivity to icterohaemorrhagiae was associated (P < 0.05) with the number of piglets born dead. 3aleptospirosis 3aseroprevalence 3aanimal reproduction 3aserotypes 3afetal death 3aantibody detection 3aherds 3areproductive efficiency 3asows 3aLeptospira 3aBrazil 0areproductive losses 0aswine1 aSouza, G.N.1 aLilenbaum, W.0 tTheriogenology.g2006 Sept. 1, v. 66, no. 4 p.1021-1025dButterworth-Heinemannx0093-691X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2005.08.0283electronic resource  a20070124b20070202c00000000  aINDdNZMe2007/01/24  aOther US 7aarticle03557naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002300154245010300177300001600280520236400296650001102660650001802671650002502689650001902714650001302733650002202746650001102768650001102779650001102790650001002801650001502811650001702826650001402843650001302857650001502870700002902885773018102914856005503095852000903150655001203159IND60617337520221122041305.0181025e200410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061733752DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1095-8312.2004.00377.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnatskaya, Olga V.10aHeart and liver as developmental bottlenecks of mammal design: evidence from cell polyploidization  ap. 175-186.  aA new concept in physiological evolution in mammals is proposed based on the data of cell and developmental biology. The levels of mammal cardiomyocyte and hepatocyte ploidy were analysed with regards to body mass, growth rate in different periods of ontogenesis, and maximal functional potential of the heart and liver in the adult state. For both organs, cell ploidy and functional potential of the organ correlated inversely. Polyploid cells were shown to have a lower amount of protein per genome and a lower ratio of mitochondrial internal membrane to tissue-specific cellular machinery (i.e. a lower energy supply) compared with diploid cells. Both cell ploidy and functional potential of the organ correlated with the animal growth rate that controls the organ functional load, but only if measured during the period of ontogenesis when polyploidization of the particular organ proceeds. However, correlation was in opposite directions: negative in the heart and positive in the liver. This is because these organs provide predominantly for the antagonistic tasks that they perform during ontogenesis. The liver provides a gain in body mass, whereas the heart maintains locomotor activity. The balance between these tasks depends on the growth rate constrained by the degree of precocity of development. During ontogenesis, an organ that works intensively in the adult state is subjected to a low workload and is furnished plentifully by resources. On the contrary, an organ with a low functional potential in the adult state starts to work intensively just after birth and experiences a shortage of resources during growth. Our data indicate that somatic polyploidization occurs as a result of tension between growth and function caused by the limitation of resources. The highest levels of mammal cell ploidy occur in the heart and the liver, although in different species which are positioned on the opposite ends of the growth rate range. Thus, the heart and the liver seem to be developmental bottlenecks of mammal design, determining the limits of metabolic capacity of adult animals. Compared with other mammals, the human has a very slow growth rate and a very high ploidy of cardiomyocytes (thus confirming the revealed regularity). This helps explain the well-known fact that cardiovascular failure is the number one cause of human mortality. 3aadults 3aanimal growth 3abiochemical pathways 3acardiomyocytes 3adiploidy 3aearly development 3aenergy 3agenome 3ahumans 3aliver 3alocomotion 3amitochondria 3amortality 3aontogeny 3apolyploidy1 aVinogradov, Alexander E.0 tBiological journal of the Linnean Society.g2004 Oct., v. 83, no. 2 p.175-186dPublished for the Linnean Society of London by Blackwell [etc.]wJournal:jnl1847x0024-40667nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8312.2004.00377.x  aDNAL 7aarticle03090naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002000164245012600184300001400310500002400324520134400348650002401692650002501716650001201741650000901753650002801762650002001790650001701810650001001827650001801837650002001855650001601875650002901891650003001920650001201950650002201962650003201984650001102016650001602027650003002043650003902073650003102112650003102143650002002174650004102194651001202235700001802247700002602265700001702291700002002308773012702328852000902455856004802464655001202512IND4399216320221122032957.0071223e200801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439921632DNAL7 a176875852pmid7 a10.1007/s00244-007-9000-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWerner, Julieta12aA Real-Time PCR Method for the Quantification of the Two Isoforms of Metallothionein in Lake Trout (Salvelinus namaycush)  ap. 84-91.  aIncludes references  aMetallothioneins (MTs) are low-molecular-weight proteins whose physiologic roles are the regulation of essential metals Cu and Zn, sequestration of heavy metals, and free radical scavenging. Induced production of MTs in a wide variety of organisms exposed to heavy metals has made them popular exposure indicators. While it has been postulated that the three different isoforms of MT play different physiologic roles, methods to discern induction separately have not been available. The development of real-time polymerase chain reaction (real-time PCR) primers and TaqMan probes to measure the two MT isoforms found in salmonid fish are described. Assuming a high degree of homology between the isoforms and within different groups of salmonids, the sequences for MT-I and MT-II from rainbow trout were used to develop primers and probes for lake trout using the Primer3 program. Two sections of each isoform that varied by only a few nucleotides were targeted. SYBR Green validated the primer specificity, and melt curve analysis further ensured that only one product was amplified. Analysis of archived samples from fish captured in unmanipulated reference lakes or from lakes experimentally treated with cadmium or ethynylestradiol (EE2) afforded an examination of seasonal and contaminant influences on MT-I and MT-II mRNA expression. 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3aSalvelinus namaycush 3acadmium 3afish 3afree radical scavengers 3agene expression 3aheavy metals 3alakes 3amessenger RNA 3ametallothionein 3anucleotides 3aphysiological regulation 3apolymerase chain reaction 2aAnimals 2aCadmiumxtoxicity 2aEthinyl Estradiolxtoxicity 2aFemale 2aFresh Water 2aMetallothioneinxgenetics 2aPolymerase Chain Reactionxmethods 2aProtein Isoformsxgenetics 2aRNA, Messengerxmetabolism 2aTroutxgenetics 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxtoxicity 0aOntario1 aPalace, Vince1 aBaron, Christopher G.1 aShiu, Robert1 aYarmill, Alison0 tArchives of environmental contamination and toxicology.g2008 Jan., v. 54, no. 1 p.84-91dSpringer-Verlagx0090-43417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00244-007-9000-x 7aarticle02652naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002000171245010600191300001600297500002400313520122400337650002401561650001801585650001801603650002101621650001101642650002201653650001801675650000901693650001601702650001001718650001401728650003201742650002801774650001201802650002501814650001101839650002001850650002201870700001401892700001701906700002101923700001701944773013301961852000902094856005502103655001202158IND4444896920221122012016.0101105e201010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444489692DNAL7 a200509542pmid7 a10.1111/j.1439-0396.2009.00951.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSoleimani, A.F.10aORIGINAL ARTICLE: Ileal endogenous amino acid flow of broiler chickens under high ambient temperature  ap. 641-647.  aIncludes references  aHigh environmental temperature has detrimental effects on the gastrointestinal tract of poultry. An experiment was conducted to determine the effect of acute heat stress on endogenous amino acid (EAA) flow in broiler chickens. A total of 90, day‐old broiler chicks were housed in battery cages in an environmentally controlled chamber. Chicks were fed a nitrogen‐free diet on day 42 following either no heat exposure (no‐heat) or 2 weeks exposure to 35 ± 1 °C for 3 h from days 28 to 42 (2‐week heat) or 1 week exposure to 35 ± 1 °C for 3 h from days 35 to 42 (1 week heat). The most abundant amino acid in the ileal flow was glutamic acid, followed by aspartic acid, serine and threonine in non‐heat stressed group. The EAA flow in 1‐week heat and 2‐week heat birds were significantly (p < 0.05) higher than those under no heat exposure (14682, 11161 and 9597 mg/kg of dry matter intake respectively). Moreover, the EAA flow of 2‐week heat group was less than 1‐week heat group by approximately 36%. These observations suggest that the effect of heat stress on EAA flow is mostly quantitative; however, heat stress may also alter the content of EAA flow qualitatively. 3aambient temperature 3aaspartic acid 3abattery cages 3abroiler chickens 3achicks 3adry matter intake 3aglutamic acid 3aheat 3aheat stress 3aileum 3athreonine 2aAcclimatizationxphysiology 2aAmino Acidsxmetabolism 2aAnimals 2aChickensxphysiology 2aFemale 2aHot Temperature 2aIleumxmetabolism1 aKasim, A.1 aAlimon, A.R.1 aMeimandipour, A.1 aZulkifli, I.0 tJournal of animal physiology and animal nutrition.g2010 Oct., v. 94, no. 5 p.641-647dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0931-24397nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0396.2009.00951.x 7aarticle02171naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245008200124300001600206500001500222520090700237650001801144650001201162650002601174650002401200650001101224650001201235650001201247650001601259650001701275650002201292650001201314650001601326650001601342650001501358650001901373650001601392650002201408653001101430653001401441653001801455700001301473700001701486773010801503852000901611930003301620945001301653946001101666655001201677IND2048920720221122011744.0951124e199412  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204892072DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeach, G.10aEffective diffusivity of total solids and pectic substances from apple tissue  ap. 687-697.  a2019-12-05  aThe effective diffusivities of total solids and pectic substances from apple tissue were determined at 40 and 60 degrees C in water and buffer; the addition of pectolytic enzyme in buffer at 40 degrees C was also investigated. The Fickian model for unsteady-state diffusion was applicable in all cases. Effective diffusivity values both for total solids and soluble pectic substances in deionized water were temperature dependent. The effective diffusivity values for total solids loss were reduced by the presence of buffer at 40 degrees C but not at 60 degrees C. The effective diffusivity values for soluble pectic substances were not affected by buffer at 40 degrees C but were noticeably lower at 60 degrees C compared to deionized water at the same temperature. The addition of a pectolytic enzyme preparation did not improve the mass transfer of either total solids or soluble pectic substances. 3aplant tissues 3aosmosis 3amembrane permeability 3amathematical models 3aapples 3abuffers 3apectins 3adiffusivity 3alipoproteins 3apolygalacturonase 3asolutes 3amethodology 3aapple juice 3asolubility 3acell membranes 3atemperature 3agalacturonic acid 0asugars 0aapparatus 0aconcentration1 aPyle, L.1 aNiranjan, K.0 tInternational journal of food science & technology.g1994 Dec., v. 29, no. 6 p.687-697x0950-54237nnas  aDNAL  a19960102b19960111c00000000  aINDdRAM  aNon-US 7aarticle02552naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072000900110100002000119245010700139300001600246500002400262520097300286650002001259650001101279650001601290650001901306650001901325650002001344650002201364650002201386650001501408650001301423650001401436650001701450650001801467650002401485650003301509650002401542650002001566650001101586650002001597650002601617653002501643653002601668700001701694700001601711700001501727700002501742773010901767852000901876856007701885945002501962946001101987655001201998IND4361991720221122011819.0040409e200311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436199172DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF6001 aVillasuso, A.L.10aGibberellin signal in barley aleurone: early activation of PLC by G protein mediates amylase secretion  ap. 197-205.  aIncludes references  aThe early events related to intracellular GA-signals in aleurone are not clearly established. We demonstrate that GA treatment induced increases in phosphatidylinositol 4P, 5-kinase (PtdInsP-k), diacylglycerol kinase (DAG-k) and phosphatidate kinase (PA-k) activities in barley aleurone within 5 min. The response to GA was also observed as a rapid and transient InsPs/InsP3 time-dependent accumulation. U73122, a phospholipase C (PLC) inhibitor, reduced the InsPs and InsP3 levels and amylase secretion. The G protein activator Mas7 was able to trigger the α-amylase secretion as strongly as GA did; U73122, also reduced this effect. ABA evoked only an increase in phosphatidic acid (PtdOH) and diacylglycerol pyrophosphate (DGPP) levels. This is the first time that a rapid and transient response to GA in correlation with amylase secretion, involving PLC and G protein as well as PA-k activity in the GA signalling pathway, has been demonstrated in aleurone cells. 3aHordeum vulgare 3abarley 3agrain crops 3aaleurone layer 3aplant proteins 3aphospholipase C 3aenzyme activation 3aenzyme inhibition 3aG-proteins 3aamylases 3asecretion 3agibberellins 3aabscisic acid 3asignal transduction 3aphosphatidylinositol kinases 3ainositol phosphates 3abioaccumulation 3alipids 3aphosphorylation 3adiacylglycerol kinase 0aphosphatidate kinase 0ainositol triphosphate1 aMolas,  M.L.1 aRacagni, G.1 aAbdala, G.1 aMachado-Domenech, E.0 tPlant growth regulation.g2003 Nov., v. 41, no. 3 p.197-205dKluwer Academic Publishersx0167-69037nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.kluweronline.com/issn/0167-6903/contents3electronic resource  aINDdRSCe2004/05/03  aNon-US 7aarticle03732naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001800171245018300189300001600372500002400388520182500412650000802237650001202245650001802257650001002275650001202285650002502297650000902322650001402331650001002345650001402355650001202369650002202381650001702403650001402420650001802434650001102452650001002463650001602473650001202489650003402501650009702535650001102632650005802643650001102701650000902712650007302721650001502794651001002809651002502819700001702844700001402861700001602875700001702891700001402908773010802922852000903030856005503039655001203094IND4457765920221121235619.0110507e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445776592DNAL7 a215454382pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-2761.2011.01255.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFreeman, M.A.10aSpraguea (Microsporida: Spraguidae) infections in the nervous system of the Japanese anglerfish, Lophius litulon (Jordan), with comments on transmission routes and host pathology  ap. 445-452.  aIncludes references  aAnglerfish from the genus Lophius are a globally important commercial fishery. The microsporidian Spraguea infects the nervous system of these fish resulting in the formation of large, visible parasitic xenomas. Lophius litulon from Japan were investigated to evaluate the intensity and distribution of Spraguea xenomas throughout the nervous system and to assess pathogenicity to the host and possible transmission routes of the parasite. Spraguea infections in L. litulon had a high prevalence; all fish over 403 mm in standard length being infected, with larger fish usually more heavily infected than smaller fish. Seventy percent of all fish examined had some gross visible sign of infection. The initial site of development is the supramedullary cells on the dorsal surface of the medulla oblongata, where all infected fish have parasitic xenomas. As the disease progresses, a number of secondary sites typically become infected such as the spinal, trigeminal and vagus nerves. Fish with infection in the vagus nerve bundles often have simultaneous sites of infection, in particular the spinal nerves and along the ventral nerve towards the urinary bladder. Advanced vagus nerve infections sometimes form xenomas adjacent to kidney tissue. Spraguea DNA was amplified from the contents of the urinary bladders of two fish, suggesting that microsporidian spores may be excreted in the urine. We conclude that supramedullary cells on the hindbrain are the primary site of infection, which is probably initiated at the cutaneous mucous glands where supramedullary cells are known to extend their peripheral axons. The prevalence of Spraguea infections in L. litulon was very high, and infections often extremely heavy; however, no associated pathogenicity was observed, and heavily infected fish were otherwise normal. 3aDNA 3aLophius 3aMicrosporidia 3aaxons 3abladder 3adisease transmission 3afish 3afisheries 3ahosts 3ainfection 3akidneys 3amedulla oblongata 3anerve tissue 3aparasites 3apathogenicity 3aspores 3aurine 3avagus nerve 2aAnimals 2aApansporoblastinaxphysiology 2aCentral Nervous System Fungal Infectionsxepidemiologyxmicrobiologyxpathologyxveterinary. 2aFemale 2aFish Diseasesxepidemiologyxmicrobiologyxpathology. 2aFishes 2aMale 2aMicrosporidiosisxepidemiologyxmicrobiologyxpathologyxveterinary. 2aPrevalence 3aJapan 0aJapanxepidemiology.1 aYokoyama, H.1 aOsada, A.1 aYoshida, T.1 aYamanobe, A.1 aOgawa, K.0 tJournal of fish diseases.g2011 June, v. 34, no. 6 p.445-452dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0140-77757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2761.2011.01255.x 7aarticle01917naa a2200601 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100002200133245016300155300001600318300002400334520020500358650002900563650001700592650001300609650001200622650000900634650001800643650001200661650000800673650001000681650002200691650003300713650004000746650000900786650001800795650003000813650002800843650001100871650002700882650002900909650001100938650001900949650002900968650002300997650000901020650001901029650002401048700001501072700001601087700001601103700001501119773009301134852001301227939003301240945000801273946001301281852000901294655001201303991615813240742620221121224140.0900501e19900125xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI900005482DNAL7 a24036602pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOstlund, R.E.

Whole and de-hulled peas were pin milled to produce raw flours. A portion of these meals were processed to produce whole extruded and de-hulled extruded meals. Additionally, a portion of the whole pea meal was processed by infrared cooking to produce a micronized meal. The five meals were evaluated in practical diets for Litopenaeus vannamei under controlled laboratory conditions. The first experiment was designed to estimate apparent protein and energy availability of the various meals. Using a practical reference diet, the meals were substituted using a 70:30 ratio to produce the test diets. Based on contrasts, both extruding and micronizing the pea meals resulted in significant improvements in both apparent protein digestibility and apparent energy digestibility values. Apparent energy digestibility values for the various ingredients expressed as percentage +/- SD were: whole raw, 72.3 +/- 8.1; whole extruded, 86.0 +/- 8.9; de-hulled raw, 88.4 +/- 4.4; de-hulled extruded, 94.4 +/- 10.0; whole micronized, 94.1 +/- 10.2. To evaluate the response of shrimp to the diets containing pea meal, two 7-week growth trials were conducted in the laboratory using a practical diet formulated to contain 360 g kg(-1) protein and 90 g kg(-1) lipid. In the first growth trial the shrimp had a mean initial weight of 0.66 g and six test diets were evaluated that included the basal diet and five diets for which the pea meals were included in the diet at 250 g kg(-1) dry weight replacing whole wheat. In the second growth trial the shrimp had a mean initial weight of 1.1 g and only the whole raw and whole extruded meals were evaluated at 50, 100 and 200 g kg(-1) inclusion in the diet. At the conclusion of the first growth trial weight gain ranged from 718 to 862% and at the conclusion of the second growth trial weight gain ranged from 394 to 502%, with no significant differences or discernible trends observed as a result of the various dietary treatments. Based on the observed results, the continued evaluation of feed peas as a potential ingredient of shrimp feeds is warranted. Additionally, if feed peas are suitably priced, commercial producers are encouraged to evaluate feed peas as an alternative protein and energy source. 3adigestible protein 3afeeds 3aliveweight gain 3aingredients 3adigestibility 3adigestible energy 3ahulls 0amicronization 0anutritive value 0apea meal1 aArnold, C.R.1 aMcCallum, R.

A total of 59 traits, related to diverse agronomic, leaf quality, chemical composition and smoke properties were assessed. Chemical traits and smoke mutagenicity were estimated by near infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS) analyses of leaf lamina powders. Physical properties of cigarettes made from each RIL, and the total particulate matter (tar and nicotine yields), benzo[a]pyrene and CO contents of the main smoke stream generated by the cigarettes in mechanical smoking tests under a standard ISO regime were also analyzed. The RILs were screened for 184 amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP), inter simple sequence repeat (ISSR), sequence specific amplified polymorphism (SSAP), sequence characterized amplified region (SCAR) and biological markers. A partial genetic map including 18 linkage groups was constructed based on 138 of the markers. Substantial segregation distortion (47%) was observed in linkage groups throughout the genome. Seventy-five QTLs associated with 8-41.5% of the variation in the examined traits were identified on 12 linkage groups by simple and composite interval mapping. Nineteen QTLs had opposite effects to those expected from the ranking of parental means. 3aquantitative trait loci 3achemical composition 3acrop quality 3aamplified fragment length polymorphism 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3anicotine 3amutagenicity 3aagronomic traits 3acigarettes 3achromosome mapping 3aNicotiana tabacum 3ainbred lines 3aleaves 3aproduct quality 3acarbon monoxide 3arisk assessment 0arecombinant inbred lines 0asequence characterized amplified region 0atar 0abenzo[a]pyrene 0atobacco 0ainter simple sequence repeats 0asequence specific amplified polymorphism1 aDenoyes-Rothan, B.1 aVerrier, J.L.1 aDorlhac de Borne, F.0 tMolecular breeding.g2006 Aug., v. 18, no. 1 p.69-91dKluwer Academic PublisherswJournal:jnl53942x1380-37437nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11032-006-9019-03electronic resource40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11032-006-9019-0  a20060831b20060906c00000000  aINDdRHFe2006/08/31  aNon-US 7aarticle02885naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001400152245014500166300001600311500001500327520143800342650002101780650002501801650001801826650001201844650001301856650001201869650001001881650001101891650002701902650001401929650001601943653001501959653001501974653002701989653001102016653001502027653001102042700001502053700001302068700001802081700001602099700001602115773007802131852000902209856009202218930003302310945001302343946001102356655001202367IND2330303820221121201226.0030107e200206  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233030382DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1365-2095.2002.00201.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHamre, K.10aNutrient composition and metamorphosis success of Atlantic halibut (Hippoglossus hippoglossus, L.) larvae fed natural zooplankton or Artemia  ap. 139-148.  a2019-12-04  aAtlantic halibut larvae were fed docosohexanoic acid- (DHA) selco enriched Artemia (RH-cysts) or wild zooplankton in duplicate tanks from first-feeding and 60 days onward. The zooplankton were collected from a fertilized sea water pond and consisted mainly of different stages of Eurytemora affinis and Centropages hamatus. There were no differences in survival, or in growth during the first 45 days of feeding, between larvae fed the two prey items, but the larvae fed Artemia showed much higher incidence of malpigmentation and impaired eye migration than larvae fed zooplankton. The prey organisms contained similar amounts of dry matter and protein, but Artemia was higher in lipid and glycogen than the zooplankton. Larvae fed Artemia were higher in both glycogen and lipid than the zooplankton-fed larvae towards the end of the feeding period. There were large differences between the prey organisms in the concentrations of essential fatty acids (% of total fatty acids) which was reflected in the fatty acid composition of the larval body. It is concluded that the macronutrient composition of Artemia in the present study was probably within the optimal range for promotion of growth and survival in young Atlantic halibut. The concentration of n-3 HUFA, and especially DHA, is however, very much lower in enriched Artemia than in copepods, and may be one of the factors triggering developmental errors in Atlantic halibut. 3anutrient content 3adocosahexaenoic acid 3ametamorphosis 3aArtemia 3aglycogen 3ahalibut 3atanks 3alarvae 3abiological development 3amortality 3azooplankton 0aevaluation 0adry matter 0apigmentation disorders 0alipids 0aenrichment 0agrowth1 aOpstad, I.1 aEspe, M.1 aSolbakken, J.1 aHemre, G.I.1 aPittman, K.0 tAquaculture nutrition.g2002 June, v. 8, no. 2 p.139-148x1353-57737nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2095.2002.00201.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20030401b20030408c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02203naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001600127245012200143300001400265500001500279520077700294650003101071650003301102650001901135650001101154650002901165650001001194650001101204650001001215650002701225650001501252650002501267650002201292651001301314653002101327653003701348653002001385700001801405700001501423700001501438700001401453700002001467700001601487700001601503773008801519852000901607930003301616945002501649946001101674655001201685IND4372713120221121201150.0050726e200508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437271312DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The incidence was perceived as "high" in small ruminants and camels, but as "low" in cattle. Simultaneously, 2815 serum samples from camels (n = 628), cattle (n = 910), goats (n = 442) and sheep (n = 835) were tested. The peste des petits ruminants (PPR) antibody seroprevalence was 3% in camels, 9% in cattle, 9% in goats and 13% in sheep. The highest locality-specific seroprevalences were: camels 10%, cattle 16%, goats 22% and sheep 23%. The animals had not been vaccinated against rinderpest or PPR. Antibody seroprevalences detected in camels, cattle, goats and sheep confirmed natural transmission of PPR virus under field conditions. 3apeste des petits ruminants 3aSmall ruminant morbillivirus 3aseroprevalence 3acamels 3aRinderpest morbillivirus 3asheep 3acattle 3agoats 3ageographical variation 3arinderpest 3adisease transmission 3adisease incidence 3aEthiopia 0aRinderpest virus 0aPeste-des-petits-ruminants virus 0aanimal diseases1 aSintayehu, A.1 aLibeau, G.1 aAlbina, E.1 aRoger, F.1 aLaekemariam, Y.1 aAbayneh, D.1 aAwoke, K.M.0 tPreventive veterinary medicine.g2005 Aug., v. 70, no. 1-2 p.51-57x0167-58777nnas  aDNAL  a20060929b20061003c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/06/03  aNon-US 7aarticle03310naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100002000161245016000181300001400341500001500355520175100370650002502121650002802146650001202174650001602186650001102202650001802213650002102231650002002252650001102272650002302283650001802306650001702324650002202341650002902363650001702392651001002409651001802419653002102437653001702458653004102475653002102516653001802537700001602555700001902571773008802590852000902678930003302687945002502720946001102745655001202756IND4372712320221121171940.0050726e200508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437271232DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Subjective probability-estimation techniques were used to elicit likelihood ratios (LR) for risk factors of potential relevance to the epidemic. Experts were asked to answer questions based on their direct and local experience with ISA, rather than through knowledge gained from scientific references or experience in other regions. The results found the strongest independent predictors of ISA infection to include (1) a site's proximity to other farms with clinically infected fish, (2) a previous history of ISA on the site, (3) whether a site fallows for a month or more between year classes and (4) whether the site employs harvest vessels practicing full containment of blood and stun water. The strongest predictors of ISA severity included (1) stocking density, (2) the length of time between infection and removal of infected fish, (3) whether fish are moved between pens (after infection) and (4) a farm's sea-lice (Lepeophtheirus salmonis) status. Experts believed that transmission of ISA virus during the local epidemic was influenced by proximity (spatial and temporal) to activities resulting in large-scale shedding of virus into a shared water column, and that severity of infection corresponded more to infected-fish removal practices and certain husbandry decisions. Personnel and equipment biosecurity measures were not seen as strong predictors of either infection or severity in this analysis, though their perceived level of importance was greater among government than industry experts. 3aspatial distribution 3aLepeophtheirus salmonis 3aexperts 3aSalmo salar 3aanemia 3aectoparasites 3aOrthomyxoviridae 3arisk assessment 3asalmon 3atemporal variation 3astocking rate 3arisk factors 3adisease outbreaks 3ainfectious salmon anemia 3afish culture 3aMaine 3aNew Brunswick 0aanimal husbandry 0aepidemiology 0aviral diseases of animals and humans 0aanemia (disease) 0afish diseases1 aEllis, S.K.1 aBartlett, C.A.0 tPreventive veterinary medicine.g2005 Aug., v. 70, no. 1-2 p.17-28x0167-58777nnas  aDNAL  a20060929b20061003c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/06/03  aNon-US 7aarticle02796naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072001700145072001700162072001700179100001700196245013500213300001400348500002400362520128600386650002001672650001901692650003201711650002801743650001201771650002301783650001201806650002601818650002701844650001901871700002501890700001501915700001401930700001301944700001601957700001401973773012001987852000902107856006902116856004802185930003302233945002502266946001102291655001202302IND4383234420221121171946.0060830e200608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438323442DNAL7 a10.1007/s11032-006-9006-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

We present a comparative analysis of the quantitative trait loci (QTL) which resolved between from within-species effects for adventitious rooting in two populations of hybrids between Pinus elliottii and P. caribaea, an outbred F1 (n=287) and an inbred-like F2 family (n=357). Most small to moderate effect QTL (each explaining 2-5% of phenotypic variation, PV) were congruent (3 out of 4 QTL in each family) and therefore considered within-species effects as they segregated in both families. A single large effect QTL (40% PV) was detected uniquely in the F2 family and assumed to be due to a between-species effect, resulting from a genetic locus with contrasting alleles in each parental species. Oligogenic as opposed to polygenic architecture was supported in both families (60% and 20% PV explained by 4 QTL in the F2 and F1 respectively). The importance of adventitious rooting for adaptation to survive water-logged environments was thought in part to explain oligogenic architecture of what is believed to be a complex trait controlled by many hundreds of genes. 3aPinus elliottii 3aPinus caribaea 3ainterspecific hybridization 3aquantitative trait loci 3arooting 3aadventitious roots 3ahybrids 3apolygenic inheritance 3avegetative propagation 3aplant cuttings1 aHuang, Stanley S.

The lowest developmental thermal threshold (Tb) was 2.2°C and the thermal constant (K) was 165.6 day-degree. The degree-day model predicted the occurrence of adults 0-1 day before the time they were first observed in the field. The age-specific life table parameters, on a degree-day time scale, indicated that the temperatures 23°C and 25°C provided the best thermal conditions for the population growth of M. persicae. At these temperatures the highest intrinsic rate of natural increase (rm = 0.012) was observed as well as the lowest mean generation time (T = 303.8 degree-day and T = 272 degree-day, respectively) and population doubling time (TD = 57.8 degree-day). 3alife tables 3arearing 3aMyzus persicae 3amodels 3aleaves 3akale 3apopulation growth 3atemperature 3aBrassica oleracea 3aheat sums 3acages 3aadults 0aHemiptera1 aSouza, anderlei P.0 tNeotropical entomology.g2003 , v. 32, no. 3 p.413-419dEntomological Society of Brazilx1519-566X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1590/S1519-566X20030003000053Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02279naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004100092040001800133100002500151242014000176245014400316300001600460500002400476500002400500500001500524520100400539650001401543650001001557650002001567650001601587650001201603650001201615651001101627653001401638700002101652700002301673773010901696852000901805856009101814655001201905IND4471867620221121130331.0130910s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||por||7 aIND447186762DNAL7 a10.1590/S1519-566X20030003000182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLoayza, Rosmarina M.10aCompared biology of Selenaspidus articulatus (Morgan) (Hemiptera: Diaspididae) in Citrus sinensis varieties and in Citrullus silvestris10aBiologia comparada de Selenaspidus articulatus (Morgan) (Hemiptera: Diaspididae) em cultivares de Citrus sinensis e em Citrullus silvestris  ap. 493-496.  aIncludes references  aSummary in English.  a2019-12-05  aThe biology of Selenaspidus articulatus (Morgan) was studied in four Citrus sinensis varieties (Hamlin, Natal, Pêra and Valencia) in comparison with factitious host Citrullus silvestris, a cucurbit used for the species maintenance in other countries and recently introduced into Brazil. The scale was better developed in 'Hamlin', with a high fixing capacity, making the cycle shorter and providing high survival in the period. Both for males and females, 'Natal' and 'Pêra' behaved as intermediaries, and 'Valencia' was less adequate to the insect's development. Although C. silvestris provided an extension of the cycle regarding the citrus varieties, comparable only to 'Valencia' as to female development, this cucurbit can be recommended for the maintenance of the species in laboratory, because it is long lasting (three months to one year), it is easily handled, with a wide surface to be scale-infested, and the survival is comparable to that achieved in the four studied citrus varieties. 3aCitrullus 3amales 3aCitrus sinensis 3aDiaspididae 3ainsects 3afemales 3aBrazil 0aHemiptera1 aParra, Jose R.P.1 aVendramim, Jose D.0 tNeotropical entomology.g2003 , v. 32, no. 3 p.493-496dEntomological Society of Brazilx1519-566X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1590/S1519-566X20030003000183Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01791naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002400152242010000176245010100276300001600377500002400393500002400417520054700441650002700988650001401015650001301029650001301042650000901055650001801064650002101082650001601103650001401119651001801133700002301151700002101174773010901195852000901304856009201313655001201405IND4471867920221121130412.0130910s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||por||7 aIND447186792DNAL7 a10.1590/S1519-566X2003000300021.2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBeserra, Eduardo B.10aOccurrence of gynandromorphism in Trichogramma pretiosum Riley (Hymenoptera: Trichogrammatidae)10aOcorrência de ginandromorfismo em Trichogramma pretiosum Riley (Hymenoptera: Trichogrammatidae)  ap. 507-509.  aIncludes references  aSummary in English.  aEgg parasitoids of genus Trichogramma can reproduce by arrhenotokous or thelytokous parthenogenesis.

Likewise, comparative analyses of the protein composition of ovine seminal plasma (SP) from ejaculates obtained along the year, and its relationship with sperm motility, viability and concentration of ejaculate were carried out. Western-blot analysis was performed to specifically detect P14, a ram SP protein postulated to be involved in sperm capacitation and gamete interaction [Barrios B, Fernández-Juan M, Muiño-Blanco T, Cebrián-Pérez JA. Immunocytochemical localization and biochemical characterization of two seminal plasma proteins which protect ram spermatozoa against cold-shock. J Androl 2005;26:539-49], and its variations along the year have also been established. The experiment was carried out from May 2003 to April 2004, with nine Rasa Aragonesa rams. Ejaculates obtained every 2 days were pooled and used for each assay, to avoid individual differences, and three two-dimensional SDS-PAGE gels were run for each month. The high resolution of the gradient gel allowed the image analysis software to detect around 252 protein spots, with pIs ranging from 4.2 to 7.6, and molecular weight (Mr) from 12.5 to 83.9 kDa. Four protein spots (1, 2, 3 and 4) of low Mr (15.1, 15.7, 15.9 and 21.0 kDa) and acidic pI (5.9, 5.3, 5.7 and 6.6), respectively, had the highest relative intensity in the SP map (11.2, 9.3, 4.7 and 7.7%, respectively). Spot 3 was more abundant (P < 0.05) from May to December, and negatively correlated (P < 0.05, r = -0.34) with sperm viability and concentration (P < 0.05, r = 0.36). Another 12 protein spots also had significant quantitative differences (P < 0.05) along the year, and 17 protein spots, which correlated with some seminal quality parameter, did not show quantitative monthly changes. Western-blot analysis indicated that spots 1 and 2 reacted with the anti-P14 antibody, raised against the P14 band (approximate Mr 14 kDa) of ram SP. This indicates that spots 1 and 2 are similar to RSP15 [Bergeron A, Villemure M, Lazure C, Manjunath P. Isolation and characterization of the major proteins of ram seminal plasma.

The present study aimed to characterize, using Computer-Assisted Sperm Analysis (CASA), motility patterns depicted by buck sperm and their relation to the migration efficiency in homologous (goat) and heterologous (heifer) cervical mucus in vitro. Semen was collected from 23 sexually mature bucks from three breeds by artificial vagina and sperm were assessed for motility parameters with a Hobson Sperm analyzer following extension in Sperm Analysis Medium (SAM). To study the relationship between kinematics parameters and the ability of sperm to migrate in cervical mucus, in a first experiment, motility performance of buck sperm suspended in SAM was compared against seminal plasma. In a second experiment, kinematics parameters of sperm were characterized. In a third experiment, bucks with sperm that differed in specific motion parameters were compared for the ability of their sperm to migrate through goat and bovine cervical mucus collected at estrus. In a fourth experiment, ejaculates that were compared in their migration ability and were assessed simultaneously for their motility parameters. Overall, sperm suspended in SAM medium had better velocity and similar linearity and lateral head displacement than those suspended in seminal plasma; furthermore, caprine sperm swam relatively fast (relative to bovine and ovine sperm), following a very linear trajectory. Under the conditions used, velocity parameters, linearity and lateral head displacement seemed to be related to sperm migration efficiency in homologous mucus but not in bovine cervical mucus. 3agoats 3aspermatozoa 3acervical mucus 3aculture media 3aseminal plasma 3asperm motility 3acomputer analysis 0abovine cervical mucus 0acaprine cervical mucus1 aAlfaro, V.1 aMontenegro, V.1 aRodriguez-Martinez, H.0 tTheriogenology.g2006 Sept. 1, v. 66, no. 4 p.860-867dButterworth-Heinemannx0093-691X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2006.01.0623electronic resource  a20060918b20061003c00000000  aINDdJITe2006/09/18  aOther US 7aarticle03719naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004600092040001800138072000900156072000900165100001500174245009000189300001600279500002400295520205800319650001702377650000902394650001902403650003302422650002102455650001802476650002402494650002702518650002002545650002202565653003402587653003602621653002702657653002202684653001902706653001702725700001602742700002002758700001402778700001802792700002502810700001702835700001902852700002402871773009802895852000902993856008003002930003303082945002503115946001303140655001203153IND4383201220140723000000.0060829e20060901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438320122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.theriogenology.2006.02.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL210 0aL2001 aAmmoun, I.10aEffects of breed on kinetics of ovine FSH and ovarian response in superovulated sheep  ap. 896-905.  aIncludes references  aEmbryo production is a useful tool for ex situ conservation of endangered species and breeds, despite a high variability in the ovarian response to superovulatory treatments. The current study evaluated the incidence and mechanisms of genetic factors in such variability, by determining the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of a standard treatment with ovine FSH (oFSH) in two endangered Spanish sheep breeds (Rubia del Molar, R, and Negra de Colmenar, N) in comparison to Manchega ewes (M, control group). In the first experiment, pharmacokinetics of an i.m. single dose of 1.32 mg of oFSH was evaluated in seven animals of each breed. Plasma FSH concentrations reached their maximum at 4 h post-administration in all the ewes, but several of the kinetic parameters (plasma FSH concentration at 4 h post-administration, maximum plasma FSH concentration, Cmax, and both the area under the plasma concentration-time curve extrapolated to the infinite, AUCinf, and to the last moment of sampling, AUClast) were higher in the N group. In the second trial, 10 animals of each breed were superovulated using eight decreasing doses of oFSH (3x 1.32 mg, 2x 1.10 mg, and 3x 0.88 mg). The R group, when compared to N and M, showed both a higher number of corpora lutea (13.7 ± 0.6 versus 10.0 ± 0.4 in N and 9.8 ± 0.6 in M, P < 0.05 for both) and embryos (7.9 ± 0.8 versus 4.3 ± 0.4 in N, P < 0.05, and 6.7 ± 0.5 in M, n.s.). Evaluation of pharmacokinetic and dynamic parameters showed that, although there was a trend for a higher hormone availability in R sheep, mean FSH plasma concentrations were similar between breeds (0.54 ± 0.08 ng/ml for R, 0.45 ± 0.05 ng/ml for N and 0.35 ± 0.05 ng/ml for M). However, differences were found in the number of preovulatory follicles growing in response to the FSH treatment between R (24.4 ± 2.2), M (18.9 ± 1.5, n.s.) and N sheep (14.1 ± 1.4; P < 0.01). Thus, differences in embryo yields between breeds would be related to differences in the pattern of follicular growth in response to FSH treatment. 3asheep breeds 3aewes 3asuperovulation 3afollicle-stimulating hormone 3apharmacokinetics 3adose response 3ahormonal regulation 3afollicular development 3aembryo (animal) 3abreed differences 0aRubia del Molar (sheep breed) 0aNegra de Colmenar (sheep breed) 0aManchega (sheep breed) 0aendangered breeds 0aovulation rate 0aembryo yield1 aEncinas, T.1 aVeiga-Lopez, A.1 aRos, J.M.1 aContreras, I.1 aGonzalez-Añover, P.1 aCocero, M.J.1 aMcNeilly, A.S.1 aGonzalez-Bulnes, A.0 tTheriogenology.g2006 Sept. 1, v. 66, no. 4 p.896-905dButterworth-Heinemannx0093-691X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2006.02.0243electronic resource  a20070122b20070202c00000000  aINDdNZMe2007/01/22  aOther US 7aarticle02392naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002000152245008700172300001600259500001500275520106400290650001701354650001001371650002001381650001601401650000901417650000901426650002501435650001401460650002701474650001001501650001301511650002001524650001701544650001401561650002401575650001301599653002101612700001701633700002301650773007901673852000901752856009201761930003301853945001301886946001101899655001201910IND2333476420221121060843.0030710e200209  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233347642DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1365-2095.2002.00202.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKeshavanath, P.10aEvaluation of carbohydrate rich diets through common carp culture in manured tanks  ap. 169-174.  a2019-12-04  aFour diets (T0-T3) were formulated reducing the fishmeal (Indian) component by 100 g kg(-1) from 300 to 0 g kg(-1) and including proportionately increasing quantities of maize.

The protein sparing effect of dietary carbohydrate and the economic implication of eliminating fishmeal from the diet are discussed. 3afish culture 3afeeds 3afeed conversion 3aproteinases 3acarp 3acorn 3adietary carbohydrate 3afish meal 3atriacylglycerol lipase 3atanks 3aamylases 3aenzyme activity 3afish feeding 3amortality 3acarcass composition 3abody fat 0adigestive juices1 aManjappa, K.1 aGaṅgādhara, Bi.0 tAquaculture nutrition.g2002 Sept., v. 8, no. 3 p.169-174x1353-57737nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2095.2002.00202.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20031001b20031010c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02854naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001700127245010200144300001600246500001500262520167900277650003001956650003201986650001702018650002302035650001402058650002502072650002202097650002602119650002302145650001202168650001602180651001602196653001002212700001902222700001902241773009402260852000902354930003302363945002502396946001102421655001202432IND4373790920221121060717.0050829e20050912xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437379092DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aVos, C.J. de10aCost-effectiveness of measures to prevent classical swine fever introduction into The Netherlands  ap. 235-256.  a2019-12-05  aRecent history has demonstrated that classical swine fever (CSF) epidemics can incur high economic losses, especially for exporting countries that have densely populated pig areas and apply a strategy of non-vaccination, such as The Netherlands. Introduction of CSF virus (CSFV) remains a continuing threat to the pig production sector in The Netherlands. Reducing the annual probability of CSFV introduction (P(CSFV)) by preventive measures is therefore of utmost importance. The choice of preventive measures depends not only on the achieved reduction of the annual P(CSFV), but also on the expenditures required for implementing these measures. The objective of this study was to explore the cost-effectiveness of tactical measures aimed at the prevention of CSFV introduction into The Netherlands. For this purpose for each measure (i) model calculations were performed with a scenario tree model for CSFV introduction and (ii) its annual cost was estimated. The cost-effectiveness was then determined as the reduction of the annual P(CSFV) achieved by each preventive measure (deltaP) divided by the annual cost of implementing that measure (deltaC). The measures analysed reduce the P(CSFV) caused by import or export of pigs. Results showed that separation of national and international transport of pigs is the most cost-effective measure, especially when risk aversion is assumed. Although testing piglets and breeding pigs by a quick and reliable PCR also had a high cost-effectiveness ratio, this measure is not attractive due to the high cost per pig imported. Besides, implementing such a measure is not allowed under current EU law, as it is trade restrictive. 3ageographical distribution 3aClassical swine fever virus 3afood animals 3adisease prevention 3aherd size 3adisease transmission 3adisease outbreaks 3acost benefit analysis 3acost effectiveness 3apiglets 3ahog cholera 3aNetherlands 0aswine1 aSaatkamp, H.W.1 aHuirne, R.B.M.0 tPreventive veterinary medicine.g2005 Sept. 12, v. 70, no. 3-4 p.235-256x0167-58777nnas  aDNAL  a20060929b20061003c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/06/03  aNon-US 7aarticle03997naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004600092040001800138072000900156072000900165100001200174245014200186300001600328500002400344500001500368520215000383650003302533650001002566650002802576650002302604650002302627650001902650650001102669650001902680650001402699650001802713650001102731650002302742650001602765650001802781650001402799650002202813650002502835650000902860650002002869650001202889650002202901650001502923650002702938653001802965700001202983700001502995700001903010700002003029700001903049700002103068773009803089852000903187856008003196930003303276945002503309946001303334655001203347IND4383198820221121060641.0060829e20060901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438319882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.theriogenology.2006.01.0572doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL210 0aL8401 aLiu, X.10aOvarian and endocrine responses to prostaglandin F2α (PGF2α) given at the expected time of the endogenous FSH peak at mid-cycle in ewes  ap. 811-821.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aIn the ewe, a rise in circulating concentrations of FSH preceding follicular wave emergence begins in the presence of growing follicles from a previous wave. We hypothesized that prostaglandin F2α (PGF2α) given at the time of an endogenous FSH peak in cyclic ewes would result in synchronous ovulation of follicles from two consecutive waves, increasing ovulation rate. Twelve Western White Face (WWF) ewes received a single i.m. injection of PGF2α (15 mg/ewe) at the expected time of a peak in FSH secretion, from Days 9 to 12 after ovulation. The mean ovulation rate after PGF2α treatment (2.3 ± 0.3) did not differ (P > 0.05) from the pre-treatment ovulation rate (1.7 ± 0.1). Five ewes ovulated follicles from follicular waves emerging before and after PGF2α injection (3.0 ± 0.6 ovulations/ewe) and seven ewes ovulated follicles only from a wave(s) emerging before PGF2αa treatment (2.0 ± 0.3 ovulations/ewe; P > 0.05). The mean interval from PGF2α to emergence of the next follicular wave (1.0 ± 0.4 and 4.0 ± 0.0 d, respectively; P < 0.001) and the interval from PGF2α treatment to the next FSH peak (0 and 3.5 ± 0.4 d, respectively; P < 0.05) differed between the two groups. Six ewes ovulated after the onset of behavioral estrus, with a mean ovulation rate of 1.7 ± 0.2, and six ewes ovulated both before and after the onset of estrus (3.0 ± 0.5 ovulations/ewe; P < 0.05). None of the ovulations that occurred before estrus resulted in corpora lutea (CL) with a full life span. At 24 h before ovulation, follicles ovulating before or after the onset of estrus differed in size (4.1 ± 0.3 or 5.5 ± 0.4 mm, respectively; P < 0.05) and had distinctive echotextural characteristics. In conclusion, the administration of PGF2α at the expected time of an FSH peak at mid-cycle in ewes may alter the endogenous rhythm of FSH secretion and was not consistently followed by ovulation of follicles from two follicular waves. In non-prolific WWF ewes, PGF2α-induced luteolysis disrupted the normal distribution of the source of ovulatory follicles and may be associated with untimely follicular rupture and luteal inadequacy. 3afollicle-stimulating hormone 3asemen 3areactive oxygen species 3alipid peroxidation 3aseasonal variation 3amale fertility 3asummer 3aprostaglandins 3aovulation 3aluteinization 3aestrus 3aGraafian follicles 3aspermatozoa 3acorpus luteum 3aSimmental 3ahormone secretion 3asuperoxide dismutase 3aewes 3aenzyme activity 3aNellore 3abreed differences 3abeef bulls 3aglutathione peroxidase 0aestrous cycle1 aDai, Q.1 aHart, E.J.1 aDuggavathi, R.1 aBarrett, D.M.W.1 aRawlings, N.C.1 aBartlewski, P.M.0 tTheriogenology.g2006 Sept. 1, v. 66, no. 4 p.811-821dButterworth-Heinemannx0093-691X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2006.01.0573electronic resource  a20060913b20061003c00000000  aINDdJITe2006/09/13  aOther US 7aarticle03766naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001700152245018500169300001600354500001500370520227000385650002002655650001302675650001402688650002502702650002302727650002502750650001102775650002702786650001202813650001402825650001402839650002302853653001502876700001702891700002402908700001702932700001402949700001502963700001602978700001502994700001403009773007903023852000903102856009203111930003303203945001303236946001103249655001203260IND2333479420221121060901.0030710e200209  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233347942DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1365-2095.2002.00205.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTocher, D.R.10aEffects of dietary vitamin E on antioxidant defence mechanisms of juvenile turbot (Scophthalmus maximus L.), halibut (Hippoglossus hippoglossus L.) and sea bream (Sparus aurata L.)  ap. 195-207.  a2019-12-04  aIn order to enhance growth, survival and quality during early juvenile stages of marine fish it is important to avoid lipid oxidation problems that are known to cause pathologies and disease. The aim of the present study was to characterize and compare the antioxidant systems in juvenile marine fish of commercial importance in European aquaculture, namely turbot (Scophthalmus maximus), halibut (Hippoglossus hippoglossus) and gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata). The experiment investigated the interaction of the dietary antioxidant micronutrient, vitamin E, with antioxidant defence systems. Fish were fed with diets of identical unsaturation index supplemented with graded amounts of vitamin E. The relationships between dietary and subsequent tissue vitamin E levels were determined as well as the effects of vitamin E supplementation on lipid and fatty acid compositions of both liver and whole fish, on the activities of the liver antioxidant defence enzymes, and on the levels of liver and whole body lipid peroxidation products, malondialdehyde (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, TBARS) and isoprostanes. Growth and survival was only significantly affected in sea bream where feeding the diet with the lowest vitamin E resulted in decreased survival and growth. A gradation was observed in tissue vitamin E and polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA)/vitamin E levels in response to dietary vitamin E levels in all species. The activities of the main radical scavenging enzymes in the liver, catalase, superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase generally reflected dietary and tissue vitamin E levels being highest in fish fed with the lowest level of vitamin E. The indicators of lipid peroxidation gave consistent results in all three species, generally being highest in fish fed with the unsupplemented diet and generally lowest in fish fed with the diet with highest vitamin E. In this respect, isoprostane levels generally paralleled TBARS levels supporting their value as indicators of oxidative stress in fish. Overall the relationships observed were logical in that decreased dietary vitamin E led to decreased levels of tissue vitamin E, and generally higher activities of the liver antioxidant enzymes and higher levels of lipid peroxides. 3anutrient intake 3acatalase 3avitamin E 3adevelopmental stages 3alipid peroxidation 3asuperoxide dismutase 3aturbot 3aglutathione peroxidase 3ahalibut 3aoxidation 3amortality 3adefense mechanisms 0ainhibitors1 aMourente, G.1 aEecken, A. van der.1 aEvjemo, J.O.1 aDíaz, E.1 aBell, J.G.1 aGeurden, I.1 aLavens, P.1 aOlsen, Y.0 tAquaculture nutrition.g2002 Sept., v. 8, no. 3 p.195-207x1353-57737nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2095.2002.00205.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20031001b20031010c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle01454naa a2200397 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001700115245006000132300001800192300002600210520036400236650002300600650002800623650002600651650002000677650002300697650000900720650001600729650002400745650001400769651001300783653002600796700001500822700001800837700001700855773009600872852001300968930003300981945000801014946001301022852000901035655001201044991615806980742620221121060643.0880916e19880428xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI880030412DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWalter, H.J.10aModification of risk factors for coronary heart disease  ap. 1093-1100.  ap. 1093-1100. charts.  aA 5-year study of 3388 school children in 37 New York City schools assessed the effectiveness of an educational intervention program aimed at reducing coronary heart disease risk factors.

These losses are most often associated with fetal overgrowth, a syndrome known as large offspring syndrome (LOS), and excessive maternal plasma pregnancy serum protein 60 (PSP60), a protein similar to a pregnancy-associated glycoprotein of 67 kDa (PAG I67) produced by the bovine placenta. Predicting the outcome of pregnancies initiated from cloned embryos has become an important issue both to prevent potential harm to the mother because of excessive fetal size at birth and also to get a better understanding of the relationships between growth, differentiation and placental functions in developing cloned fetuses. Here, we report on a systematic analysis of fetal and placental development in the first trimester of pregnancy performed by ultrasonographic imaging and by measurement of the maternal concentrations of pregnancy associated glycoproteins (PAGS), using four different radioimmunoassays (RIA) (two homologous RIA systems with PSP60 and PAG I67; two heterologous RIA systems with PAG I67 as standard and tracer, and antisera anti-caprine PAGs). We showed that crown-rump length (CRL) in clones appeared smaller than controls at 35, 50 and 62 days (P < 0.05). At 62 days of pregnancy, CRL in cloned fetuses that died before 90 days was smaller compared to the other cloned fetuses (P < 0.05) whereas the width of the fetal sack and the biparietal diameter (BPD) was larger in fetuses that developed LOS in late gestation (P < 0.05). Maternal PAGs concentrations were statistically different between controls and all clone recipients as early as Day 34, suggesting early abnormal placental glycoprotein synthesis for clone pregnancies regardless of pregnancy outcome. This work provides a practical, non-invasive tool to follow up clone pregnancies and suggests that primary growth retardation and abnormal placental function precedes excessive fetal and placental growth at later stages of pregnancy. 3apregnancy rate 3acattle 3afetal death 3aclones 3afetal development 3acloning (animals) 3aembryo transfer 3aextraembryonic membranes 3apregnancy outcome 3aglycoproteins 3aultrasonography 0apregnancy associated glycoproteins 0alarge offspring syndrome 0apregnancy complications1 aSousa, N. de1 aLaigre, P.1 aCamous, S.1 aPonter, A.A.1 aBeckers, J.F.1 aHeyman, Y.0 tTheriogenology.g2006 Sept. 1, v. 66, no. 4 p.829-840dButterworth-Heinemannx0093-691X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2006.01.0613electronic resource  a20060913b20061003c00000000  aINDdJITe2006/09/13  aOther US 7aarticle01852naa a2200421 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001800115245014300133300001800276300002600294520064500320650003100965650002400996650001701020650001001037650002101047650000901068653001601077700001601093700001701109700001701126700001801143700001801161700001701179700001701196700001801213700001701231773009401248852001301342939003301355945000801388946001301396852000901409655001201418991615806190742620221121045530.0880330e19870507xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI870033322DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchatzkin, A.10aAlcohol consumption and breast cancer in the epidemiological follow-up study of the first national health and nutrition examination survey  ap. 1169-1173.  ap. 1169-1173. charts.  aThe relationship between moderate alcohol consumption and breast cancer was examined in a cohort study based on the first National Health Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) of the U.S. population.

In this research, consumption of any amount of alcohol conferred an increase risk of breast cancer of 50 to 100%. 3amammary neoplasms (animal) 3aalcoholic beverages 3aepidemiology 3awomen 3anational surveys 3arisk 0aconsumption1 aJones, D.Y.1 aHoover, R.N.1 aTaylor, P.R.1 aBrinton, L.A.1 aZiegler, R.G.1 aHarvey, E.B.1 aCarter, C.L.1 aLicitra, L.M.1 aDufour, M.C.0 tNew England journal of medicine.g1987 May 7, v. 316, no. 19 p.1169-1173x0028-47937nnas  aDNAL FNC  a00000000b19880330c00000000  aFNC  aOther US  aDNAL 7aarticle02788naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002400164245011200188300001600300500002400316520098500340650002101325650002501346650001201371650001001383650002501393650001401418650003001432650003401462650002201496650002101518650002601539650004101565650003101606650003101637650007201668650004001740650002201780650002801802650001401830650003901844650002701883650003401910651001501944651001001959651001501969651001001984700002401994700001402018773009602032852000902128856008502137655001202222IND4424620720221121045614.0090814s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442462072DNAL7 a194842952pmid7 a10.1007/s00284-009-9432-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSukhawindara Kaura.10aDiversity of Arsenate Reductase Genes (arsC Genes) from Arsenic-Resistant Environmental Isolates of E. coli  ap. 288-294.  aIncludes references  aA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) approach was used to assess the occurrence and diversity of arsenate reductase gene (arsC gene) in arsenic-resistant environmental E. coli strains. For this purpose, two different sets of primers were designed for the specific amplification of approximately 370-bp fragments from the arsC gene. These primers were used to screen a collection of 25 environmental arsenic-resistant strains isolated from different geographical regions of India, as well as Bangladesh. The PCR results showed that 17 out of the 25 environmental isolates (68%) contained a gene related to the arsC family. Phylogenetic analysis of the protein sequences deduced from the amplicons indicated a prevalence of arsC genes in the isolated strains. A significant divergence in the DNA sequence was found in the arsC genes among As-resistant environmental E. coli strains from this study, and arsenic resistance, a genetic character, arose from a common ancestral background. 3aEscherichia coli 3aamino acid sequences 3aarsenic 3agenes 3anucleotide sequences 3aphylogeny 3apolymerase chain reaction 2aArsenate Reductasesxgenetics 2aArsenicxtoxicity 2aCluster Analysis 2aDNA Primersxgenetics 2aDNA, Bacterialxchemistryxgenetics. 2aDrug Resistance, Bacterial 2aEnvironmental Microbiology 2aEscherichia colixdrug effectsxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aEscherichia coli Proteinsxgenetics 2aGenetic Variation 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhylogeny 2aPolymerase Chain Reactionxmethods 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 3aBangladesh 3aIndia 0aBangladesh 0aIndia1 aKamli, Majid Rasool1 aAli, Arif0 tCurrent microbiology.g2009 Sept., v. 59, no. 3 p.288-294dSpringer-Verlagx0343-86517nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00284-009-9432-93Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02321naa a2200373 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100002200115245006900137300001800206300002600224520130000250650001301550650001701563650001901580650001501599650001801614650001401632653001201646653001101658653002101669700002401690700002301714700001901737700002301756773009301779852000901872930003301881945000801914946001301922655001201935991615805330742620221121034842.0820603e198204  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI820007922DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLambert, Craig A.10aRisk factors and life style: A statewide health-interview survey  ap. 1048-1051.  ap. 1048-1051. charts.  aFour health-related life-style habits (exercise, smoking, weight, alcohol use) of 1091 Massachusetts residents are profiled from data obtained in a 1980 health-interview survey. The demographic distributions within the study sample closely approximated distributions for sex, age-range, and marital status obtained in the 1980 census. Definitive data for each of the 4 habits are discussed separately. The survey found that these habits ranked in the following order of incidence: overweight (43.3%), smoking (33.0%), no exercise (28.3%), and robust alcohol use (11.7%). Women reported more high-risk behavior than men in all areas except alcohol consumption. Older individuals reported less smoking and alcohol use than younger people. However, older people reported markedly less exercise and had a higher prevalence of overweight, 2 factors which are clearly related. Persons having higher education and (to a lesser extent) higher incomes reported lower risk scores on all 4 habits, suggesting that social advantages may include behavior patterns that enrich physical well-being. Because social advantages are not prerequisites to good health, it is suggested that preventive medicine and health education might produce a profound, positive health impact on less advantaged populations.

In this study, we used three sets of Wolbachia-specific primers (16S rDNA, ftsZ, and wsp) in conjunction with the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), cloning and sequencing to study the infection of fruit flies (Anastrepha spp. and Ceratitis capitata) by Wolbachia. The flies were collected at several localities in Brazil and at Guayaquil, Ecuador. All of the fruit flies studied were infected with Wolbachia supergroup A, in agreement with the high prevalence of this group in South America. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the wsp gene was the most sensitive gene for studying the relationships among Wolbachia strains. The Wolbachia sequences detected in these fruit flies were similar to those such as wMel reported for other fruit flies. These results show that the infection of Anastrepha fruit flies by Wolbachia is much more widespread than previously thought. 3aAnastrepha 3aCeratitis capitata 3aWolbachia 3aarthropods 3abacteria 3acytoplasmic incompatibility 3afeminization 3afruit flies 3agenes 3aparthenogenesis 3aphylogeny 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aribosomal DNA 2aAnimals 2aBacterial Outer Membrane Proteinsxgenetics 2aBacterial Proteinsxgenetics 2aCluster Analysis 2aCytoskeletal Proteinsxgenetics 2aDNA, Bacterialxchemistryxgenetics. 2aDNA, Ribosomalxchemistryxgenetics. 2aFemale 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhylogeny 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 16Sxgenetics 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aTephritidaexmicrobiology 2aWolbachiaxclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 3aBrazil 3aEcuador 0aBrazil 0aEcuador1 aBraz, Antônio S.

  1 aAhmed, I.10aDietary arginine requirement of fingerling Indian major carp, Cirrhinus mrigala (Hamilton)  ap. 217-225.  a2019-12-04  aDietary arginine requirement of fingerling Indian major carp, Cirrhinus mrigala (4.20 ± 0.05 cm; 0.60 ± 0.02 g) was determined by conducting a 8-week feeding trial with casein-gelatine-based diets (400 g kg-1 crude protein; 17.90 kJ g-1, gross energy), containing crystalline amino acids with graded levels of L-arginine (10, 12.5, 15, 17.5, 20 and 22.5 g kg-1, dry diet). Fish were randomly stocked, in triplicate groups, in 55-L indoor polyvinyl flow through circular tanks and fed experimental diets at 5% of their body weight divided into two feedings at 08.00 and 16.00 hours. Live weight gain (321%) and feed conversion ratio (FCR 1.40) were significantly (P < 0.05) higher in fish fed diet containing 17.5 g kg-1 dietary arginine compared with other diets. Second-degree polynomial regression analysis of live weight gain, FCR and protein efficiency ratio data indicated requirements for dietary arginine at 18.7, 18.4 and 18.3 g kg-1 of the dry diet, respectively. Maximum carcass protein, and minimum moisture and fat contents were noticed at the requirement level. Carcass ash content remained insignificantly different among the treatments except at 17.5 g kg-1 dietary arginine showing significantly higher ash content. Based on the above results, it is recommended that the diet for fingerling C. mrigala should contain arginine at 18.4 g kg-1, dry diet, corresponding to 46 g kg-1 dietary protein for optimum growth and efficient feed utilization. 3afish culture 3aanimal growth 3adietary protein 3afeed conversion 3aarginine 3acarp 3aequations 3afingerlings 3aamino acid requirements 3aliveweight gain 3acarcass composition 3aCirrhinus cirrhosus 3afeed composition 3astatistical analysis 3afish feeding 3amortality 3aaquaculture tanks 0afish 0afeeding trials 0aCirrhinus 0aprotein efficiency ratio1 aKhan, M.A.0 tAquaculture nutrition.g2004 Aug., v. 10, no. 4 p.217-225x1353-57737nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2095.2004.00293.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20040913b20041003c00000000  aINDdGAYe2004/09/13  aNon-US 7aarticle03687naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002000171245013600191300001600327500002400343520171200367650002502079650002002104650003102124650001002155650000902165650001102174650002202185650001802207650002802225650001702253650003002270650001702300650001602317650001002333650002502343650002302368650007502391650001802466650002402484650002602508650003402534650001702568650003802585650004402623650004202667650003802709650001302747650003402760650004802794700002002842700001902862700002202881773010602903852000903009856005503018655001203073IND4401227720221121034918.0080210e200803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440122772DNAL7 a182754612pmid7 a10.1111/j.1399-3054.2007.01009.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAttia, Houneida10aLong-term effects of mild salt stress on growth, ion accumulation and superoxide dismutase expression of Arabidopsis rosette leaves  ap. 293-305.  aIncludes references  aArabidopsis thaliana plants (wild-type accessions Col and N1438) were submitted to a prolonged, mild salt stress using two types of protocols. These protocols allowed salt-treated plants to absorb nutrients either through a part of their root system maintained in control medium (split-rooted plants) or during episodes on control medium alternating with salt application (salt alternation experiment). Full-salt treatments (salt applied continuously to whole root system) resulted in severe (but non-lethal) growth inhibition. This effect was partly alleviated in split-rooted plants on mixed salt-control medium and in plants submitted to salt-control medium alternation. The activity of the various isoforms of superoxide dismutases (SODs) did not appreciably change with the treatments. The abundance of the mRNAs of the seven SOD genes present in Arabidopsis genome was determined using real-time polymerase chain reaction. The two protocols gave qualitatively identical results. The expression level was increased by full-salt treatments for some genes and diminished for other genes. However, the nature of these genes differed according to the accessions: the responses to salt of FSD1 and MSD were opposite in Col and N1438. In Col, salt treatments inhibited the expression of FSD1 and strongly stimulated that of CSD1 and MSD. In N1438, the stimulation by salt concerned FSD1 and CSD1 and MSD expression being inhibited. In both accessions, the expression of CSD2 and CSD3 was lowered by salt. For all genes, the treatments that mitigated stress partially restored SOD expression to control level. Thus, the changes in SOD transcript abundance accurately reflected the severity of the salt stress. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3aions 3aleaves 3along term effects 3amessenger RNA 3aphysiological transport 3aplant growth 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aroot systems 3asalt stress 3asalts 3asuperoxide dismutase 2aAnionsxmetabolism 2aArabidopsisxdrug effectsxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aBase Sequence 2aCationsxmetabolism 2aDNA Primersxgenetics 2aGene Expressionxdrug effects 2aGenes, Plant 2aIsoenzymesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlant Leavesxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aRNA, Messengerxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRNA, Plantxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSalinity 2aSodium Chloridexpharmacology 2aSuperoxide Dismutasexgeneticsxmetabolism.1 aArnaud, Nicolas1 aKarray, Najoua1 aLachaâl, Mokhtar0 tPhysiologia plantarum.g2008 Mar., v. 132, no. 3 p.293-305dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0031-93177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1399-3054.2007.01009.x 7aarticle02766naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004600092040001800138072000900156072000900165100001600174245014300190300001600333500002400349500001500373520135800388650001801746650002601764650002001790650000901810650002001819650001201839650001801851653001801869700001401887700001401901700001401915700001401929700001501943700001401958700001401972700001401986700001402000773009802014852000902112856008002121930003302201945002502234946001302259655001202272IND4383197920221121034913.0060829e20060901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438319792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.theriogenology.2006.01.0592doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL210 0aL2001 aJeong, H.J.10aGene expression profiling of the pre-implantation mouse embryo by microarray analysis: Comparison of the two-cell stage and two-cell block  ap. 785-796.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aTo improve our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying early embryo development, further characterization of gene activity in oocytes and embryos is urgently required. The transition from the two-cell to four-cell stage is particularly important in pre-implantation embryonic development, as it involves transcriptional reprogramming and cellular differentiation. In this study, we used a 7.4 K cDNA microarray to screen mRNA transcript levels in the pre-implantation mouse embryo. Real-time PCR was used to confirm microarray data. We profiled 7410 genes and identified 4562 genes that were differentially expressed in the pre-implantation embryo. We selected a total of 248 genes with significant expression changes that are functionally involved in the two-cell and two-cell block embryo. Of these genes, 114 were down-regulated and the remainder (n = 134) were up-regulated in the two-cell embryo. This study provides a developmental map of a large number of genes in the pre-implantation mouse embryo with particular emphasis on gene expression in the two-cell embryo and two-cell block embryo. Further investigations based on this data will provide a better understanding of the effects of various external conditions and may facilitate comparative analysis of pre-implantation development in other mammalian species, including human. 3amessenger RNA 3amicroarray technology 3aembryo (animal) 3amice 3agene expression 3aoocytes 3acell cleavage 0aembryogenesis1 aKim, H.J.1 aLee, S.H.1 aKwack, K.1 aAhn, S.Y.1 aChoi, Y.J.1 aKim, H.G.1 aLee, K.W.1 aLee, C.N.1 aCha, K.Y.0 tTheriogenology.g2006 Sept. 1, v. 66, no. 4 p.785-796dButterworth-Heinemannx0093-691X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2006.01.0593electronic resource  a20060913b20061003c00000000  aINDdJITe2006/09/13  aOther US 7aarticle02133naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001500164245007100179300001800250500002400268520080100292650000801093650001601101650001601117650002401133650001401157650001901171650001201190650001801202650002401220650001801244650002801262650001401290650002901304650004401333650004401377650004301421700001601464700001501480773009801495852000901593856008501602655001201687IND4424617420221121024155.0090814s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442461742DNAL7 a195622522pmid7 a10.1007/s00705-009-0435-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMin, B.

The complete genome sequence of CMMoV consists of 6,449 nucleotides. The genome RNA of the virus contains four open reading frames, encoding, from the 5' to the 3' end, the 120-kDa viral replicase, the 186-kDa viral polymerase, the 33-kDa movement protein and the 18-kDa coat protein. Overall amino acid similarities for the four viral proteins of CMMoV ranged from 16.3 to 44.4% compared to those of 20 other tobamoviruses. Phylogenetic analysis of the viral replicases and MP revealed that CMMoV is closely related to cucurbit-infecting tobamoviruses, while the CMMoV CP is more closely related to brassica- and solanaceous-infecting tobamoviruses. 3aRNA 3aTobamovirus 3anucleotides 3aopen reading frames 3aphylogeny 3aviral proteins 3aviruses 2aBase Sequence 2aCactaceaexvirology 2aGenome, Viral 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhylogeny 2aPlant Diseasesxvirology 2aPlant Viral Movement Proteinsxgenetics 2aRNA-Dependent RNA Polymerasexgenetics. 2aTobamovirusxclassificationxgenetics.1 aSong, Y.

  1 aHaas, Y. de10aAssociations between somatic cell count patterns and the incidence of clinical mastitis  ap. 55-68.  aAssociations between clinical mastitis (CM) and the proportional distribution of patterns in somatic cell count (SCC) on a herd level were determined in this study. Data on CM and SCC over a 12-month period from 274 Dutch herds were used. The dataset contained parts of 29,719 lactations from 22,955 cows of different parities. In total, 207,079 SCC test-days were recorded with 5719 cases of CM; 1561 cases were associated with environmental pathogens (ENV_CM), and 2681 with contagious pathogens (CONT_CM). Definitions of patterns in SCC were based on 3, 4, or 5 consecutive test-day recordings of SCC that differentiated between short or longer periods of increased SCC, and also between lactations with and without recovery. The distribution of those patterns (relative to their maximum) varied among herds. The distribution of SCC patterns was correlated with the incidence rate of CM. Herds with a relatively frequent quick recovery pattern had a 2.5 times more chance of being classified in the upper quartile for CM. These herds also had 2.1 times more chance of being classified in the upper quartile for ENV_CM but only 0.4 times for CONT_CM. Herds with a relatively frequent no recovery pattern had less chance (odds ratio = 0.5) of being classified in the lower quartile for CONT_CM. Since the distributions of SCC patterns were indicative for overall, environmental and contagious CM, the necessity to introduce pathogen-specific mastitis control programs in a herd could be determined based on the mean incidences of SCC patterns in that herd. 3asomatic cell count 3abovine mastitis 3aherd health 3adisease control 3adisease incidence 3aanimal pathogens 3adairy cows 3adisease course 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aCell Countxveterinary 2aFemale 2aIncidence 2aLactation 2aMastitis, Bovinexdiagnosisxepidemiologyxmicrobiology. 2aMilkxcytology 2aOdds Ratio 2aParity 2aTime Factors 3aNetherlands 0aNetherlandsxepidemiology.1 aBarkema, H.W.1 aSchukken, Y.H.1 aVeerkamp, R.F.0 tPreventive veterinary medicine.g2005 Jan., v. 67, no. 1 p.55-68x0167-58777nnas  aDNAL  a20060830b20060906c00000000  aINDd3CTe2006/06/06  aNon-US 7aarticle03911naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004100111040001800152100002100170245013000191300001800321500002400339520191400363650001902277650002502296650001302321650001002334650001902344650002202363650001502385650004402400650001002444650000902454650002302463650002802486650001402514650001102528650001302539650000902552650001902561650001102580650001202591650004302603650002402646650001602670650001102686650003202697650005002729650004402779650003102823700002302854700002202877700002602899700002602925700002802951700002102979700002503000700002103025773011503046852000903161856009103170655001203261IND4423907120221121015324.0090731s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442390712DNAL7 a195405652pmid7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2009.05.0472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBosisio, Stefano10aDevelopmental toxicity, uptake and distribution of sodium chromate assayed by frog embryo teratogenesis assay-Xenopus (FETAX)  ap. 5039-5045.  aIncludes references  aThe embryotoxicity and teratogenicity of Cr(VI) on the survival and morphology of the anuran Xenopus laevis have been assessed by frog embryo teratogenesis assay-Xenopus (FETAX). The lethal median (LC₅₀) and teratogenic median (TC₅₀) concentration values of Cr(VI) were 890 μM and 260 μM, respectively. The calculated teratogenic index (TI) value was 3.42, suggesting that hexavalent chromium has a teratogenic potential. Malformations of embryos included lifting of the body, coiling of the tail and body oedema. Furthermore, the chromium salt caused significant growth retardation at 25 μM exposure concentrations. The use of radiolabelled ⁵¹Cr(VI) allowed the determination of the time course uptake of Cr in Xenopus exposed to concentrations ranging from 0.025 to 500 μM. The evaluation of its distribution into the body (head-abdomen-tail) was evaluated at different exposure times. Chromium is taken up at 24 h by Xenopus embryos for all concentrations tested. At 48 h post fertilization (stage of larva) the amount of Cr accumulated by the two-day-old larva ranged from 0.42 to 580 pg mg⁻¹ wet weight at 0.025 and 500 μM respectively. These amounts were lower than those at 24 h (2.77 to 11016 pg mg⁻¹ wet weight embryo) reaching values of the same order of magnitude at 120 h (five-days-old larva). Since at 48 h Xenopus development leads to a swimming embryo, the observed uptake at 24 h could be the result of the binding of Cr to jelly coat compounds surrounding the embryo body as confirmed by gel filtration experiments on ⁵¹Cr-jelly coat. The interaction of Cr with jelly coat is in agreement with the role of jelly coat in protecting the embryo against pathogen and chemical toxins to ensure fertilization. This work further supports the hypothesis that Cr contamination of surface waters could contribute to explain the reported worldwide depletion of frog population. 3aXenopus laevis 3aabnormal development 3achromium 3aedema 3aembryotoxicity 3aexposure duration 3afiltration 3afrog embryo teratogenesis assay-Xenopus 3afrogs 3agels 3agrowth retardation 3alethal concentration 50 3apathogens 3asodium 3aswimming 3atail 3ateratogenicity 3atoxins 2aAnimals 2aChromatesxpharmacokineticsxtoxicity. 2aChromatography, Gel 2aDNA Adducts 2aFemale 2aLarvaxgrowth & development 2aSodium Compoundsxpharmacokineticsxtoxicity. 2aTeratogensxpharmacokineticsxtoxicity. 2aXenopus laevisxembryology1 aFortaner, Salvador1 aBellinetto, Sonia1 aFarina, M.q(Massimo)1 aDel Torchio, Riccardo1 aPrati, M.q(Mariangela)1 aGornati, Rosalba1 aBernardini, Giovanni1 aSabbioni, Enrico0 tScience of the total environment.g2009 Sept. 1, v. 407, no. 18 p.5039-5045dElsevier Sciencex0048-96977nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2009.05.0473Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03059naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004100111040001800152100002200170245014900192300001800341500002400359520132800383650002001711650001201731650001301743650002101756650001301777650001001790650002101800650001401821650000901835650001601844650001901860650001601879650001601895650001601911650001701927650001001944650002201954650001401976650001801990650001402008650001202022650002302034650001102057650003602068650002602104650003702130650003602167650004102203700002202244773011502266852000902381856009102390655001202481IND4423907020221121015135.0090731s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442390702DNAL7 a195559942pmid7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2009.05.0422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMishra, Ashish K.10aChronic exposure to sublethal hexavalent chromium affects organ histopathology and serum cortisol profile of a teleost, Channa punctatus (Bloch)  ap. 5031-5038.  aIncludes references  aEffects of chronic exposures (one and two months) to sublethal doses of hexavalent chromium (2 and 4 mg/L potassium dichromate) on organ histopathology and serum cortisol profile were investigated and their overall impact on growth and behavior of a teleost fish, Channa punctatus was elucidated. Histopathological lesions were distinct in the vital organs gill, kidney and liver. The gill lamellae became lifted, fused, and showed oedema. Hyperplasia and hypertrophy of lamellar epithelial cells were distinct with desquamation. Hypertrophy of epithelial cells of renal tubules and reduction in tubular lumens were observed in the trunk kidney. The atrophy of the head kidney interrenal cells and decreased serum cortisol level indicated exhaustion of interrenal activity. Hepatocyte vacuolization and shrinkage, nuclear pyknosis and increase of sinusoidal spaces were observed in the liver. Abnormal behavioral patterns and reduced growth rate were also noticed in the exposed fish. The chronic hexavalent chromium exposure thus by affecting histopathology of gill, kidney (including interrenal tissue) and liver could impair the vital functions of respiration, excretion, metabolic regulation and maintenance of stress homeostasis which in the long-run may pose serious threat to fish health and affect their population. 3aChanna punctata 3aatrophy 3achromium 3achronic exposure 3acortisol 3aedema 3aepithelial cells 3aexcretion 3afish 3afish health 3ahistopathology 3ahomeostasis 3ahyperplasia 3ahypertrophy 3akidney cells 3aliver 3along term effects 3apotassium 3arenal tubules 3ashrinkage 2aAnimals 2aChromiumxtoxicity 2aFishes 2aGillsxdrug effectsxpathology. 2aHydrocortisonexblood 2aKidneyxdrug effectsxpathology. 2aLiverxdrug effectsxpathology. 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxtoxicity1 aMohanty, Banalata0 tScience of the total environment.g2009 Sept. 1, v. 407, no. 18 p.5031-5038dElsevier Sciencex0048-96977nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2009.05.0423Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02577naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149100002100167245012300188300001800311500002400329520118000353650001601533650001601549650002001565650001601585650001801601650000901619650001501628650001401643650001301657650003001670650002801700650003801728650003301766650002201799650001101821650001101832650001901843650001301862700001901875700001601894773010001910852000902010856008802019655001202107IND4471875520221120233304.0130913s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447187552DNAL7 a239057912pmid7 a10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-12-5572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFlaherty, Claire10aInvestigation of the Use of a Cocktail of Lux-Tagged Cronobacter Strains for Monitoring Growth in Infant Milk Formulae  ap. 1359-1365.  aIncludes references  aThe objective of the present study was to create a collection of Lux-tagged Cronobacter strains to determine whether bioluminescence could be used to monitor growth of this pathogen in infant milk formula (IMF). Nine Cronobacter strains (seven C. sakazakii, one C. malonaticus, and one C. muytjensii) were transformed with plasmid p16S lux, and integration of the plasmid at the desired site on the chromosome was confirmed by PCR. The integrated plasmid was stable in the absence of antibiotic selection, and growth of the Lux-tagged strains was similar to that of their nontagged counterparts. Growth of Lux-tagged strains was monitored in real time in 10 commercial brands of IMF by measuring light emission with a luminometer. Although all of the IMF samples tested were able to support the growth of the Cronobacter strains, differences were observed among IMF brands. Variations in the amount of light emitted by individual Cronobacter strains were also noted. Monitoring light emission with a combination of two strains that produced higher and lower than average relative light readings was a good surrogate for evaluating the entire collection of Lux-tagged strains. 3aCronobacter 3aantibiotics 3abioluminescence 3achromosomes 3ainfant growth 3amilk 3amonitoring 3apathogens 3aplasmids 3apolymerase chain reaction 2aConsumer Product Safety 2aCronobacterxgrowth & development 2aFood Contaminationxanalysis 2aFood Microbiology 2aHumans 2aInfant 2aInfant Formula 2aPlasmids1 aBegley, Máire1 aHill, Colin0 tJournal of food protection.g2013 Aug., v. 76, no. 8 p.1359-1365wJournal:2024x0362-028X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-12-5573Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03840naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001900164245008200183300001800265500002400283520224000307650001202547650001602559650002302575650001602598650002502614650001702639650001102656650000902667650002002676650001302696650001902709650002502728650001202753650001102765650001002776650001302786650001702799650001602816650001202832650002502844650003402869650002102903650001202924650001002936650001702946700001802963700001702981700002002998700002303018773012703041852000903168856008503177655001203262IND4423713720221120233419.0090724s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442371372DNAL7 a194521802pmid7 a10.1007/s10295-009-0585-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGouveia, Luisa10aSolar Pond devices: free energy or bioreactors for Artemia biomass production  ap. 1035-1045.  aIncludes references  aThe recent exponential growth in industrial aquaculture has led to a huge increase in Artemia biomass production in order to meet increased fish production needs. The present study explores the potential use of salt gradient solar ponds (SGSPs) for production of Artemia nauplii. An SGSP is a basin of water where solar energy is trapped and collected via an artificially imposed gradient. Three zones can be identified in an SGSP: upper and lower zones, which are both convective, and a middle zone, which is intended to be non-convective. The latter acts as a transparent insulation layer and allows for storage of solar energy at the bottom, where it is available for use. The combination of salt, temperature and high transparency could make SGSPs promising bioreactors for the production of Artemia nauplii. Using particle image velocymetry (PIV) and Shadowgraph visualisation techniques, the behaviour of Artemia nauplii under critical cultivation parameters (namely, salinity, temperature and light) was monitored to determine movement velocity, and how movement of Artemia affects the salt gradient. It was observed that Artemia nauplii constantly follow light, irrespective of adverse salinity and/or temperature conditions. However, despite the substantial displacement of Artemia following the light source, the salt gradient is not disrupted. The suitability of SGSPs as bioreactors for Artemia biomass production was then tested. The results were disappointing, probably due to the lack of sufficient O₂ for Artemia survival and growth. Follow-up trials were conducted aimed at using the SGSP as a green and economically attractive energy source to induce faster hatching of cysts and improved Artemia nauplii growth. The results of these trials, and a case study of Artemia nauplii production using an SGSP, are presented. The authors constructed a Solar Pond device, which they suggest as a novel way of supplying thermal energy for Artemia biomass production in an aquaculture enterprise. Finally, the authors suggest a method of producing and collecting Artemia biomass, and of heating a fish larval tank, in an 'ideal' Solar Pond device, profiting from the low investment costs of using a decommissioned salt works. 3aArtemia 3aaquaculture 3abiomass production 3abioreactors 3abusiness enterprises 3acase studies 3aenergy 3afish 3afish production 3ahatching 3aheat treatment 3ainsulating materials 3anauplii 3aoxygen 3aponds 3asalinity 3asolar energy 3atemperature 2aAnimals 2aAquaculturexmethods 2aArtemiaxgrowth & development 2aBehavior, Animal 2aBiomass 2aLight 2aSolar Energy1 aSousa, João.1 aMarques, Ana1 aTavares, Célia1 aGiestas, Margarida0 tJournal of industrial microbiology & biotechnology.g2009 Aug., v. 36, no. 8 p.1035-1045dSpringer-Verlagx1367-54357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10295-009-0585-03Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03364naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149100001200167245013400179300001800313500002400331520149400355650002701849650001601876650002901892650002101921650001301942650001301955650001501968650000701983650001601990650002302006650002302029650001502052650001102067650003702078650003002115650002402145650001202169650002702181650002802208650002802236650003702264650003102301650003702332650001102369650006402380650002802444650001802472650002802490700001402518700001802532700001502550773010002565852000902665856008802674655001202762IND4471875720221120233354.0130913s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447187572DNAL7 a239057932pmid7 a10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-12-5162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Min10aInhibitory Effects of Chitosan Coating Combined with Organic Acids on Listeria monocytogenes in Refrigerated Ready-to-Eat Shrimps  ap. 1377-1383.  aIncludes references  aChitosan and organic acids are natural preservatives with proven antimicrobial efficacies. This study investigated the effects of chitosan coating combined with organic acids on inhibiting Listeria monocytogenes in ready-to-eat (RTE) shrimps during storage at 4°C. Cooked shrimps inoculated with L. monocytogenes were coated with 0.5 and 1 % chitosan solutions in combination with 2 % organic acids (acetic, citric, lactic, and malic acids) for 5 min and then stored at 4°C for 16 days. Bacterial counts, pH, and sensory properties were analyzed every 4 days. The results indicated that the antimicrobial effects of chitosan were significantly enhanced (P < 0.05) when it was combined with 2 % acetic, citric, lactic, or malic acid. Chitosan at 1 % combined with 2 % acetic acid was the most effective treatment, which caused a 5.38-log CFU/g bacterial reduction after 16 days in comparison with the controls. Transmission electron microscopy further confirmed the enhanced antimicrobial effects of the combination of chitosan and organic acids. Such combined treatments also maintained the sensory properties of RTE shrimps. The use of chitosan coating combined with organic acids significantly lowered (P < 0.05) the pH values of RTE shrimps compared with the use of chitosan alone. Therefore, we conclude that chitosan coating combined with acetic acid could be a promising antimicrobial method to prevent the proliferation of L. monocytogenes in RTE shrimps with extended shelf life. 3aListeria monocytogenes 3aacetic acid 3aantimicrobial properties 3abiopreservatives 3achitosan 3acoatings 3amalic acid 3apH 3aplate count 3aready-to-eat foods 3asensory properties 3ashelf life 3ashrimp 3atransmission electron microscopy 2aAcetic Acidxpharmacology 2aAcidsxpharmacology 2aAnimals 2aChitosanxpharmacology 2aColony Count, Microbial 2aConsumer Product Safety 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aFood Preservationxmethods 2aFood Preservativesxpharmacology 2aHumans 2aListeria monocytogenesxdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 2aPenaeidaexmicrobiology 2aRefrigeration 2aShellfishxmicrobiology1 aWang, Wen1 aFang, Weihuan1 aLi, Yanbin0 tJournal of food protection.g2013 Aug., v. 76, no. 8 p.1377-1383wJournal:2024x0362-028X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-12-5163Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02673naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144072001700161100001800178245016600196300001400362500001500376520132300391650001501714650001601729650001701745650002001762650002001782650002001802650001901822650001801841650002601859650002101885650002801906650001501934651001201949653001801961700001601979700001501995700001602010773008702026852000902113930003302122945002502155946001102180655001202191IND4370206120221120222915.0050515e20050510xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437020612DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Because milk-protein concentration is related to the energy balance, we investigated whether milk-protein concentration predicted the hazard of being inseminated. The main objective of the paper is to demonstrate that the relationship between milk-protein concentration and the hazard of being inseminated was not linear and that this non-linear relationship was modelled adequately using cubic-splines. The semiparametric Cox model was used to introduce protein concentration into the model as a time-varying covariate and additionally herd was added to the model as a frailty term to adjust for the clustering of the cows within a herd. We extended the penalised partial-likelihood technique to fit the frailty model with cubic-splines for the effect of the protein concentration. The model was fitted for a large database consisting of 5114 multiparous cows from 181 different farms. Low milk-protein concentration (<2.7%) was associated with a negative energy balance and this probably led to the decreased hazard. On the other hand, high milk-protein concentration (>4.0%) was linked with low milk production and it was probably a farmer's decision not to inseminate such cows, leading to the observed decreased hazard. 3adairy cows 3adairy herds 3ainsemination 3arisk management 3arisk assessment 3amilk production 3aenergy balance 3aanimal models 3adairy herd management 3anonlinear models 3amilk protein percentage 3aprediction 3aBelgium 0adairy protein1 aOpsomer, G.1 aDewulf, J.1 aJanssen, P.0 tPreventive veterinary medicine.g2005  10, v. 68, no. 2-4 p.81-90x0167-58777nnas  aDNAL  a20060929b20061003c00000000  aINDd4CTe2006/06/05  aNon-US 7aarticle02816naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092040001800121072001700139072001700156072001700173072001700190100001400207245009700221300001600318500001500334520108500349650001601434650001801450650001801468650002701486650001001513650001001523650003701533650003501570650001701605650003701622650000901659650001601668650002601684650001801710650004101728650002501769650001901794653004001813700001701853700001501870700001301885700001301898700001701911700002001928700001601948773009301964852000902057856007902066930003302145945002502178946001102203655001202214IND4381098820221120212552.0060616e200505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438109882DNAL7 a10.3136/fstr.11.1612doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Mice were fed on 0.5% cholesterol diet, containing 0%, 2.5% and 5.0% of QP (control, QP 2.5% and QP 5.0%, respectively) for 4 weeks. Neither supplemental QP diet produced a difference in food intake and body weight gain. The QP supplementation significantly prevented the increase in plasma and liver total cholesterol levels. Fecal weight and excretion of bile acids in the QP groups was significantly higher than in the control group. QP showed bile acid-binding activity in vitro. Expression of mRNA of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase in the liver, a key enzyme for cholesterol biosynthesis, was suppressed by the QP diet, whereas the expression of cholesterol-7alpha-hydroxylase, a cholesterol catabolic enzyme, was found to be stimulated. These results suggest that the prevention of increases in plasma and liver cholesterol levels in mice fed the QP diet can be ascribed to the inhibition of the re-absorption of bile acids in the small intestine and control of cholesterol synthesis and catabolism. 3afood intake 3aseed extracts 3ahigh fat diet 3acholesterol metabolism 3aseeds 3aliver 3acholesterol 7alpha-monooxygenase 3anutrition-genotype interaction 3ablood lipids 3aChenopodium quinoa subsp. quinoa 3amice 3acholesterol 3aintestinal absorption 3aanimal models 3ahydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductases 3acholesteremic effect 3aplant proteins 0ahydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase1 aWatanabe, N.1 aYuhara, K.1 aItoh, S.1 aSuda, S.1 aTsuruoka, Y.1 aNakatsugawa, K.1 aKonishi, Y.0 tFood science and technology research.g2005 May, v. 11, no. 2 p.161-167x1344-66067nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3136/fstr.11.1613Available from publisher's Web site  a20080229b20080301c00000000  aINDdPNNe2006/09/17  aNon-US 7aarticle02377naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092040001800121072001700139072001700156100001500173245013400188300001600322500001500338520098600353650002201339650001501361650003201376650002601408650001601434650001401450650001801464650002601482650001301508650000901521650002001530650001901550653001601569700001301585700001401598700001801612700001501630773009301645852000901738856007901747930003301826945002501859946001101884655001201895IND4381099720221120212538.0060616e200505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438109972DNAL7 a10.3136/fstr.11.1872doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Equol was detected at 0 h and levels subsequently dropped and then increased again, reaching the initial level at 24 h. In the mesenteric lymph node (MLN), thymus and spleen, genistein and daidzein were detected at 6 to 24 h. Bisphenol A and equol in the MLN was detectable at 6 to 24 h and 24 h, respectively. In the testicle, epididymis, spermatheca and prostate, higher levels of genistein and daidzein were detected around 6 h. Bisphenol A was detected in the epididymis at 6 to 12 h. These results suggest that the distribution of these chemicals and their tissue affinities in rats vary from tissue to tissue. 3auptake mechanisms 3ametabolism 3aintragastric administration 3anutrient availability 3ametabolites 3agenistein 3aanimal models 3aintestinal absorption 3adaidzein 3arats 3aplant estrogens 3aanimal tissues 0aisoflavones1 aWu, P.S.1 aOkabe, M.1 aTachibana, H.1 aYamada, K.0 tFood science and technology research.g2005 May, v. 11, no. 2 p.187-193x1344-66067nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3136/fstr.11.1873Available from publisher's Web site  a20080229b20080301c00000000  aINDdPNNe2006/09/17  aNon-US 7aarticle03692naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149100002200167245010500189300001800294500002400312520181800336650002202154650002602176650002702202650001502229650001502244650002202259650001502281650001202296650001702308650001102325650001102336650002102347650001402368650001902382650001402401650001902415650000902434650001602443650003702459650001202496650002802508650002802536650006102564650002702625650001102652650006202663650002502725650003702750650001602787700002502803700003202828700002102860773010002881852000902981856008802990655001203078IND4471876020221120212528.0130913s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447187602DNAL7 a239057952pmid7 a10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-12-5082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeil, Jennifer D.10aInactivation of Human Pathogens during Phase II Composting of Manure-Based Mushroom Growth Substrate  ap. 1393-1400.  aIncludes references  aCommercial production of white button mushrooms (Agaricus bisporus) requires a specialized growth substrate prepared from composted agricultural by-products. Because horse and poultry manures are widely used in substrate formulations, there is a need to determine the extent to which the composting process is capable of eliminating human pathogens. In this study, partially composted substrate was inoculated with a pathogen cocktail (log 10(6) to 10(8) CFU/g) containing Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli O157:H7, and Salmonella. Pathogen and indicator-organism reductions were followed at temperatures that typically occurred during a standard 6-day phase II pasteurization and conditioning procedure. Controlled-temperature water bath studies at 48.8, 54.4, and 60°C demonstrated complete destruction of the three pathogens after 36.0, 8.0, and 0.5 h, respectively. Destruction of L. monocytogenes and E. coli O157:H7 at 54.4°C occurred more slowly than E. coli, total coliforms, Enterobacteriaceae, and Salmonella. Microbial reductions that occurred during a standard 6-day phase II pasteurization and conditioning treatment were studied in a small-scale mushroom production research facility. After phase II composting, E. coli, coliforms, and Enterobacteriaceae were below detectable levels, and inoculated pathogens were not detected by direct plating or by enrichment. The results of this study show that a phase II composting process can be an effective control measure for eliminating risks associated with the use of composted animal manures during mushroom production. Growers are encouraged to validate and verify their own composting processes through periodic microbial testing for pathogens and to conduct studies to assure uniform distribution of substrate temperatures during phase II. 3aAgaricus bisporus 3aEscherichia coli O157 3aListeria monocytogenes 3aSalmonella 3abyproducts 3acoliform bacteria 3acomposting 3agrowers 3ahorse manure 3ahorses 3ahumans 3amushroom growing 3amushrooms 3apasteurization 3apathogens 3apoultry manure 3arisk 3atemperature 2aAgaricalesxgrowth & development 2aAnimals 2aColony Count, Microbial 2aConsumer Product Safety 2aEscherichia coli O157xgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aFood Handlingxmethods 2aHumans 2aListeria monocytogenesxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aManurexmicrobiology 2aSalmonellaxgrowth & development 2aTemperature1 aCutter, Catherine N.1 aBeelman, R.

To investigate this transmission in food processing environments, we developed a swabbing protocol for environmental samples, evaluated the stability of HuNoV in the swabs, and applied the method in the food industry. Swabs made of polyester, flocked nylon, cotton wool, and microfiber were moistened in either phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or glycine buffer (pH 9.5) and used to swab four surfaces (latex, plastic, stainless steel, and cucumber) inoculated with HuNoV. HuNoV was eluted with either PBS or glycine buffer and detected with quantitative reverse transcription PCR. HuNoV recoveries were generally higher with an inoculation dose of 100 PCR units than 1,000 PCR units. The highest recoveries were obtained when surfaces were swabbed with microfiber cloth moistened in and eluted with glycine buffer after a HuNoV inoculation dose of 100 PCR units: 66% ± 18% on latex, 89% ±2% on plastic, and 79% ±10% on stainless steel. The highest recovery for cucumber, 45% ±5%, was obtained when swabbing the surface with microfiber cloth and PBS. The stability of HuNoV was tested in microfiber cloths moistened in PBS or glycine buffer. HuNoV RNA was detected from swabs after 3 days at 4 and 22°C, although the RNA levels decreased more rapidly in swabs moistened with glycine buffer than in those moistened with PBS at 22°C. In the field study, 172 microfiber and 45 cotton wool swab samples were taken from environmental surfaces at three food processing companies. Five (5.6%) of 90 swabs collected in 2010 and 7 (8.5%) of 82 swabs collected in 2012 were positive for HuNoV genogroup II; all positive samples were collected with microfiber swabs. Three positive results were obtained from the production line and nine were obtained from the food workers' break room and restroom areas. Swabbing is a powerful tool for HuNoV RNA detection from environmental surfaces and enables investigation of virus transmission during food processing. 3aNorovirus 3aRNA 3abusiness enterprises 3acotton 3acucumbers 3afood contact surfaces 3afood industry 3afood surfaces 3agastroenteritis 3ahands 3ahumans 3alatex 3amonitoring 3anylon 3apH 3aplastics 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3astainless steel 3avirus transmission 2aAnimals 2aCaliciviridae Infectionsxprevention & control 2aColony Count, Microbialxmethods 2aEquipment Contamination 2aFood Contaminationxprevention & control 2aFood-Processing Industryxstandards 2aGastroenteritisxprevention & control 2aHumans 2aNorovirusxisolation & purification 2aStainless Steelxanalysis1 aRättö, Marjaana1 aTuominen, Pirkko1 aSalo, Satu1 aMaunula, Leena0 tJournal of food protection.g2013 Aug., v. 76, no. 8 p.1421-1428wJournal:2024x0362-028X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-12-3713Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02544naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139100001800157245004400175300001600219500002400235520102800259650001101287650002201298650002801320650002101348650001001369650001301379650002201392650001701414650001401431650001401445650000901459650000801468650002201476650001501498650001001513650001601523650000901539650001801548650004301566650001101609650002101620650002101641650001101662650000901673650001601682650001601698651001801714700001901732773014001751852000901891856007801900655001201978IND4471876720221120202845.0130913s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447187672DNAL7 a146319852pmid7 a10.1079/PNS20022192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLang, Rebecca10aWho consumes whole grains, and how much  ap. 123-127.  aIncludes references  aRegular consumption of whole grain foods has been associated with a reduction in the incidence of cardiovascular disease and diabetes, reductions in cancer mortality at certain sites and an overall reduction in premature death. Although benefits are observed at relatively low levels of intake (between two and three servings per d), the consumption of whole grain foods in some Western countries is less than one serving per d. The main sources of whole grain are wholemeal and rye breads and whole grain breakfast cereals. Typical consumers of whole-grain foods tend to be older, from a high socio-economic group, are less likely to smoke and are more likely to exercise than non-consumers. Some of these attributes may contribute to the observed health benefits. However whole grain foods are an important source of a range of nutrients as part of a healthy eating plan. There is considerable scope for strategies to promote increased consumption of whole grain foods to reduce the risk of a variety of chronic diseases. 3abreads 3abreakfast cereals 3acardiovascular diseases 3achronic diseases 3adeath 3adiabetes 3agrain consumption 3ahealthy diet 3amortality 3anutrients 3arisk 3arye 3awhole grain foods 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aAge Factors 2aAged 2aEdible Grain. 2aDietary Fiberxadministration & dosage 2aFemale 2aFood Preferences 2aHealth Promotion 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aSex Factors 0aGreat Britain1 aJebb, Susan A.0 tProceedings of the Nutrition Society.g2003 Feb., v. 62, no. 1 p.123-127dCABI Pub. on behalf of the Nutrition Societyx0029-66517nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1079/PNS20022193Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02983naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100003100164245007800195300001800273500002400291520118500315650001001500650003001510650002201540650001801562650001001580650002301590650002201613650004401635650001501679650002201694650002901716650003201745650005001777650004501827650006501872650003201937650002201969650002601991650002502017700003302042700002202075700003102097700003202128700003602160700003602196773012702232852000902359856008502368655001202453IND4423713520221120202718.0090724s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442371352DNAL7 a194370562pmid7 a10.1007/s10295-009-0583-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Souza, Giovanni Gontijo10aSelective activity of Mucor plumbeus reductase towards (-)-camphorquinone  ap. 1023-1027.  aIncludes references  aThe biotransformation of 1R-(-)-camphorquinone, achieved by growing cells of four fungi species isolated from soil (Mucor plumbeus, Lecanicillium muscarium, Thamnostylum sp. and Syncephalastrum racemosum), was investigated in optimized culture media for each species. Fungi were grown aerobically under shaking and their activities with respect to camphorquinone were monitored for 20 days by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GCMS). Camphorquinone was found to be stable in control flasks throughout the experiment. The most interesting results were found for M. plumbeus, which was only able to perform monoreduction of camphorquinone when cultivated on a glucose-peptone-yeast extract medium. Large-scale experiments were set up and the camphorquinone biotransformation products formed by M. plumbeus were purified by column chromatography and identified by ¹H and ¹³C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Theoretical calculations were employed as a complementary technique to unambiguously identify the biotransformation products. These findings suggest that M. plumbeus could be of great use for the selective reduction of camphorquinone and related compounds. 3aMucor 3aSyncephalastrum racemosum 3abiotransformation 3aculture media 3afungi 3agas chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 2aAerobiosis 2aBiotransformation 2aCulture Mediaxchemistry 2aFungal Proteinsxmetabolism 2aGas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometryxmethods 2aMagnetic Resonance Spectroscopyxmethods 2aMucoralesxenzymologyxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aOxidoreductasesxmetabolism 2aSoil Microbiology 2aSubstrate Specificity 2aTerpenesxmetabolism1 aAnconi, Cleber Paulo Andrada1 aCornelissen, Sjef1 aDe Almeida, Wagner Batista1 aDos Santos, Hélio Ferreira1 aFortes, Isabel Cristina Pereira1 aTakahashi, Jacqueline Aparecida0 tJournal of industrial microbiology & biotechnology.g2009 Aug., v. 36, no. 8 p.1023-1027dSpringer-Verlagx1367-54357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10295-009-0583-23Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02170naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001600144245007700160300001600237520112300253650001201376650002301388650001701411650002101428650001201449650001701461650003701478650003001515650002301545651001601568700001401584700001701598773009101615852000901706930003301715945002501748946001101773655001201784IND4369432520221120202820.0050502e200502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436943252DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aHenning, J.10aAttitudes of New Zealand farmers to methods used to control wild rabbits  ap. 171-194.  aFour years after the release of Rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) in New Zealand, we conducted a mail survey of farmers to ascertain their attitudes and practices about rabbit control. A multistage sampling frame (stratified by rabbit-proneness and farm type) was used to select 828 farms in eight geographical regions. The useable response proportion of the survey was 69.3%, and 21% of respondents considered rabbits to be a problem on their farms. Although practices for rabbit control had changed from 1995 to 2001, shooting (practised by 85% of respondents) remained the predominant method used (albeit less frequently than in 1995). Ten percent of farmers used RHDV baiting; of those, 90% released the virus relatively infrequently. Farmers perceived shooting to be the most-humane and environmentally safe method, while RHDV was perceived to be the most effective. Perception of the level of competition for grazing between rabbits and livestock was the factor most-strongly associated with the use of shooting and RHDV. Most (60%) respondents considered the introduction of RHDV to have been beneficial. 3afarmers 3afarmers' attitudes 3awild animals 3avertebrate pests 3arabbits 3apest control 3aRabbit hemorrhagic disease virus 3abiological control agents 3abiological control 3aNew Zealand1 aHeuer, C.1 aDavies, P.R.0 tPreventive veterinary medicine.g2005 Feb., v. 67, no. 2 -3 p.171-194x0167-58777nnas  aDNAL  a20060929b20061003c00000000  aINDd5CTe2006/06/12  aNon-US 7aarticle02191naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092040001800121072001700139072001700156072001700173100001500190245011400205300001600319520062300335650001500958650002700973650001501000650003001015650000901045650002601054650001601080650001901096650001901115650001501134650001901149650003501168650002301203650002801226650001801254650001801272650002901290700001701319700001701336700001301353700001701366700001601383773009301399852000901492856007901501930003301580945002501613946001101638655001201649IND4381100820221120202715.0060616e200505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438110082DNAL7 a10.3136/fstr.11.2312doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aYamaki, T.10aHigh oleic peanut oil modulates promotion stage in lung tumorigenesis of mice treated with methyl nitrosourea  ap. 231-235.  aThis study was undertaken to estimate the effect of high-oleic peanut oil (HO) on the promotion stage of lung tumorigenesis in mice. On day 30 after methyl nitrosourea administration, dietary HO inhibited ornithine decarboxylase activity, induced the inactivation of Mek, and reduced the level of proliferating cell nuclear antigen in lungs of mice more than did high-linoleic safflower oil. A parallel effect was observed in the level of prostaglandin E2 in the lungs. These results suggest that HO suppresses the promotion stage of lung tumorigenesis in mice and that the suppression correlates to the level of PGE2. 3apeanut oil 3afatty acid composition 3aoleic acid 3aanticarcinogenic activity 3amice 3aanimal disease models 3acarcinogens 3acarcinogenesis 3alung neoplasms 3afat intake 3aprostaglandins 3anutrition-genotype interaction 3acell proliferation 3aornithine decarboxylase 3ahigh fat diet 3asafflower oil 3aconjugated linoleic acid1 aNagamine, I.1 aFukumoto, K.1 aYano, T.1 aMiyahara, M.1 aSakurai, H.0 tFood science and technology research.g2005 May, v. 11, no. 2 p.231-235x1344-66067nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3136/fstr.11.2313Available from publisher's Web site  a20080229b20080301c00000000  aINDdPNNe2006/09/17  aNon-US 7aarticle02110naa a2200265 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100003500145245013800180300001600318500002400334520122000358650001201578650001501590650001301605650001301618651001701631773009001648852000901738856008501747655001201832IND4423689520221120202701.0090724s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442368952DNAL7 a10.1007/s10708-008-9237-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSiyongwana, Pakama Queenscious14aThe impact of political transformation on employment in the Transkei bureaucracy and civil service in Umtata, South Africa since 1994  ap. 293-310.  aIncludes references  aThe demise of South African Apartheid Planning in 1994 and subsequent lost of Umtata's capital status when the Transkei was subsumed into the new Eastern Cape Province resulted in the major political transformation of the Transkei state. Central to the post-apartheid transformation was restructuring of Transkei bureaucracy which at the time of South Africa's independence in 1994 displayed abnormalities. This paper documents the restructuring of the Transkei bureaucracy focusing on Umtata since 1994. The study has brought to the forefront the following facts: Firstly, that at the time of the Transkei merger into South Africa, employment in the government was 'booming' and to greater extent it was affected by Umtata's role--being the capital city of the pseudo-Transkei state. Secondly, the post 1994-political transformation of the Transkei Bantustan impacted negatively on Umtata's employment notably the civil service sector by 'squeezing' it during the early years of democracy (1994-2000). Thirdly, since 2001, with Umtata serving as the major urban centre of both King Sabata Local Municipality and OR Tambo District Municipality, employment in the civil service and municipality has been revitalized. 3acapital 3aemployment 3aplanning 3apolitics 3aSouth Africa0 tGeoJournal.g2009 Aug., v. 74, no. 4 p.293-310dSpringer Netherlandsx0343-25217nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10708-008-9237-63Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02887naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100001400161245005500175300001400230500015600244500001500400520156900415650001701984650001402001650001102015650002402026650002002050650002702070650001802097650001402115650002502129650003702154650002002191650001402211650002202225653002702247773008902274852000902363930003302372945002502405946001102430655001202441IND4369419220221120192058.0050502e200502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436941922DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The impacts of recent technological developments in diagnosis, genetic characterisation, data processing and statistical analysis are evaluated. It is concluded that the acquisition and availability of data remains the principal constraint to the application of available techniques in veterinary epidemiology and economics, especially at population level. As more commercial producers use computerised management systems, the availability of data for analysis within herds is improving. However, consistency of recording and diagnosis remains problematic. Recent trends to the development of national livestock databases intended to provide reassurance to consumers of the safety and traceability of livestock products are potentially valuable sources of data that could lead to much more effective application of veterinary epidemiology and economics. These opportunities will be greatly enhanced if data from different sources, such as movement recording, official animal health programmes, quality assurance schemes, production recording and breed societies can be integrated. However, in order to realise such integrated databases, it will be necessary to provide absolute control of user access to guarantee data security and confidentiality. The potential applications of integrated livestock databases in analysis, modelling, decision-support, and providing management information for veterinary services and livestock producers are discussed. 3aepidemiology 3aeconomics 3amodels 3aveterinary medicine 3arisk assessment 3ainformation management 3adata analysis 3alivestock 3astatistical analysis 3agenetic techniques and protocols 3aanimal diseases 3adatabases 3adisease diagnosis 0ainformation technology0 tPreventive veterinary medicine.g2005 Feb., v. 67, no. 2 -3 p.91-99x0167-58777nnas  aDNAL  a20060929b20061003c00000000  aINDd4CTe2006/06/09  aNon-US 7aarticle02313naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100003200145245004800177300001600225500002400241520128200265650002501547650003001572650001101602650001801613650001501631650001501646650002201661650001201683650002101695650002801716650001301744651001001757773009001767852000901857856008501866655001201951IND4423689620221120181610.0090724s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442368962DNAL7 a10.1007/s10708-008-9238-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOluoko-Odingo, Alice Atieno10aDeterminants of poverty: lessons from Kenya  ap. 311-331.  aIncludes references  aPoverty and food security are twin concerns of Kenya in a manner similar to many affected developing countries. It is characterized by the inability of the affected households in the country to acquire and retain sustainable livelihoods. The picture in Kenya is bound to be complicated by the projected changes in climate, as well as by population increase and environmental degradation, all which will put pressure on the natural resource base and militate against the achievement of sustainable development. The poverty picture in Kenya has hardly changed since independence over four decades ago despite the enormous resources and efforts which have been directed at tackling it. The current national poverty level remains high at well over 70% in some pockets which remain particularly vulnerable. Following the recent post-election violence, there is now a fear that the situation could degenerate into famine conditions and further hopelessness for a sizeable proportion of the rural population. Government efforts to eradicate poverty and food insecurity spelled out in a thirty year development plan are unlikely to succeed unless underlying causes of inequality are properly addressed. The paper contains suggestions for new approaches to addressing the twin problems. 3adeveloping countries 3aenvironmental degradation 3afamine 3afood security 3ahouseholds 3alivelihood 3apopulation growth 3apoverty 3arural population 3asustainable development 3aviolence 3aKenya0 tGeoJournal.g2009 Aug., v. 74, no. 4 p.311-331dSpringer Netherlandsx0343-25217nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10708-008-9238-53Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03070naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245016000163300001800323500002400341520172700365650003202092650002702124650002502151650001702176650002202193650001602215650001002231650002602241650002402267650001102291700001802302700001202320700001902332700002202351700001702373700002102390700001602411773012702427852000902554856008502563655001202648IND4423713420221120181617.0090724s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442371342DNAL7 a10.1007/s10295-009-0579-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnzai, Yojiro10aProduction of rosamicin derivatives in Micromonospora rosaria by introduction of d-mycinose biosynthetic gene with ΦC31-derived integration vector pSET152  ap. 1013-1021.  aIncludes references  aSome of the polyketide-derived bioactive compounds contain sugars attached to the aglycone core, and these sugars often impart specific biological activity to the molecule or enhance this activity. Mycinamicin II, a 16-member macrolide antibiotic produced by Micromonospora griseorubida A11725, contains a branched lactone and two different deoxyhexose sugars, d-desosamine and d-mycinose, at the C-5 and C-21 positions, respectively. The d-mycinose biosynthesis genes, mycCI, mycCII, mycD, mycE, mycF, mydH, and mydI, present in the M. griseorubida A11725 chromosome were introduced into pSET152 under the regulation of the promoter of the apramycin-resistance gene aac(3)IV. The resulting plasmid pSETmycinose was introduced into Micromonospora rosaria IFO13697 cells, which produce the 16-membered macrolide antibiotic rosamicin containing a branched lactone and d-desosamine at the C-5 position. Although the M. rosaria TPMA0001 transconjugant exhibited low rosamicin productivity, two new compounds, IZI and IZII, were detected in the ethylacetate extract from the culture broth. IZI was identified as a mycinosyl rosamicin derivative, 23-O-mycinosyl-20-deoxo-20-dihydro-12,13-deepoxyrosamicin (MW 741), which has previously been synthesized by a bioconversion technique. This is the first report on production of mycinosyl rosamicin-derivatives by a engineered biosynthesis approach. The integration site ΦC31attB was identified on M. rosaria IFO13697 chromosome, and the site lay within an ORF coding a pirin homolog protein. The pSETmycinose could be useful for stimulating the production of “unnatural” natural mycinosyl compounds by various actinomycete strains using the bacteriophage ΦC31 att/int system. 3aMicromonospora griseorubida 3aMicromonospora rosaria 3abioactive properties 3abiosynthesis 3abiotransformation 3achromosomes 3agenes 3amacrolide antibiotics 3aopen reading frames 3asugars1 aIizaka, Yohei1 aLi, Wei1 aIdemoto, Naoki1 aTsukada, Shu-ichi1 aKoike, Kazuo1 aKinoshita, Kenji1 aKato, Fumio0 tJournal of industrial microbiology & biotechnology.g2009 Aug., v. 36, no. 8 p.1013-1021dSpringer-Verlagx1367-54357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10295-009-0579-y3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03306naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139100001800157245004300175300001400218500002400232520147000256650002301726650001101749650001401760650001301774650001001787650001701797650001801814650001801832650001801850650001301868650001601881650001501897650002001912650001201932650001201944650002201956650001901978650001901997650001202016650002102028650001502049650001102064650001202075650002502087650001002112650002102122650005602143650005802199650001102257650001702268650001802285650001102303650001102314650000902325650002102334650003402355700001802389773013802407852000902545856007802554655001202632IND4471873820221120170857.0130913s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447187382DNAL7 a127400522pmid7 a10.1079/PNS20022312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEdwards, C.A.10aDietary fibre in infancy and childhood  ap. 17-23.  aIncludes references  aThere is very little evidence for the effects of dietary fibre in young children and current dietary guidelines are based on assumptions and data extrapolated from studies in adults. The first years of life may be critical for the establishment of a healthy colonic microflora, as well as good eating habits. The lack of clear and well-founded guidelines for the intake of dietary fibre in childhood may hinder both factors. The fears that a high-fibre diet in children <5 years of age will lead to growth faltering and mineral imbalance are not well supported in the literature, especially for children in the developed world. Indeed, with the rising levels of obesity, fibre intake may be of benefit in reducing energy intake. A low-fibre diet may also be implicated in the aetiology of childhood constipation and appendicitis. The latest proposals for the definition of dietary fibre include oligosaccharides, which may act as prebiotics. There are potential health benefits of including oligosaccharides in the diets of infants and children, but more research is needed to consider the long-term effects. The immature intestine of the infant may also result in a greater amount of starch entering the colon during weaning, and this starch would now be considered dietary fibre under the new definitions. Much new research is needed to allow adequate recommendations for the intake of dietary fibre in childhood based on data collected in appropriate age-groups. 3aDietary Guidelines 3aadults 3achildhood 3achildren 3acolon 3aconstipation 3adietary fiber 3aeating habits 3aenergy intake 3aetiology 3afood intake 3aguidelines 3ahigh fiber diet 3ainfancy 3ainfants 3along term effects 3alow fiber diet 3amicroorganisms 3aobesity 3aoligosaccharides 3aprebiotics 3astarch 3aweaning 2aBacteriaxmetabolism 2aChild 2aChild, Preschool 2aDietary Fiberxadministration & dosagexmetabolism. 2aDigestive Systemxgrowth & developmentxmicrobiology. 2aFemale 2aFermentation 2aFood Analysis 2aHumans 2aInfant 2aMale 2aNutrition Policy 2aObesityxprevention & control1 aParrett, A.M.0 tProceedings of the Nutrition Society.g2003 Feb., v. 62, no. 1 p.17-23dCABI Pub. on behalf of the Nutrition Societyx0029-66517nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1079/PNS20022313Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01844naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001800144245010200162300001600264500001500280520061800295650002000913650001900933650001700952650002900969650002300998650001501021650002501036650002201061650001501083651001901098653001701117653002101134700001801155700002401173700001501197700001501212773009301227852000901320930003301329945002501362946001101387655001201398IND4371603320221120170903.0050621e20050712xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437160332DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The model predictions for the inter-epidemic period in Sudan and Somalia (1.2 and 4.2 years, respectively) were in agreement with analysis of livestock-owner reports (1-2 years and 5 years, respectively). 3asmall ruminants 3adisease models 3afood animals 3aRinderpest morbillivirus 3astrain differences 3arinderpest 3adisease transmission 3adisease outbreaks 3aimmunology 3aEastern Africa 0aepidemiology 0aRinderpest virus1 aMcDermott, J.1 aHeesterbeek, J.A.P.1 aCatley, A.1 aRoeder, P.0 tPreventive veterinary medicine.g2005 July 12, v. 69, no. 3-4 p.245-263x0167-58777nnas  aDNAL  a20060929b20061003c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/06/03  aNon-US 7aarticle03595naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154072000900163072000900172100001800181245018300199300001600382500002400398500001500422520193700437650001302374650002702387650002002414650002202434650000902456650002602465650001202491650001702503650002102520650001802541650001602559650001502575650002302590650001802613650001902631650003202650650004302682651001202725653002002737700001902757773011802776852000902894856006902903930003302972945002503005946001103030655001203041IND4383212720221120171013.0060829e200608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438321272DNAL7 a10.1017/S00218596060062772doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF821 0aF110 0aF120 0aJ7001 aPitan, O.O.R.10aEffects of intercropping tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) at different times with cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) or okra (Abelmoschus esculentus) on crop damage by major insect pests  ap. 361-368.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aTwo 2-year field trials were conducted in Nigeria to investigate the effectiveness of tomato intercropped at different times with cowpea or okra in controlling the field densities of cowpea pod-sucking bugs and okra flea beetles. The two experiments were arranged as split-plots within a randomized complete block design. The main plots were 4-week-old tomato seedlings transplanted into a field, with cowpea or okra intercropped at 0, 2 or 4 weeks after transplanting tomatoes, while the two sub-plots were cowpea or okra sole crop and tomato/cowpea or tomato/okra intercrop. The densities of the pod-sucking bugs Clavigralla tomentosicollis, Riptortus dentipes, Anoplocnemis curvipes and Nezara viridula were significantly lower (P<0·05) on cowpea intercropped at 2 weeks after transplanting tomatoes than those obtained in the sole crop. Similarly, cowpea seed damage was significantly lower (P<0·05) on cowpea planted at 2 and 4 weeks after transplanting tomatoes than in the monocrop and when cowpea and tomato were planted simultaneously. Cowpea yields were influenced by both time of intercropping and cropping system; in the intercrop, the highest yield was obtained at 2 weeks after transplanting tomatoes. In the tomato/okra intercrop, the numbers of flea beetles (Podagrica spp.) were significantly influenced (P<0·05) by cropping system alone; their density was significantly lower (P<0·05) in the intercrop than in the sole crop irrespective of time of intercropping. Similarly, damage was significantly higher (P<0·05) in the sole crop than in the intercrop while yield comparable to that of the monocrop was obtained at 2 WAT. The highest land equivalent ratio (LER) for cowpea (1·8 and 1·6) or okra (0·7 and 0·8) was obtained at 2 weeks after transplanting tomatoes in both years. Two weeks after tomato establishment appeared to be the best time to introduce either cowpea or okra into the cropping system. 3atomatoes 3aAbelmoschus esculentus 3aNezara viridula 3aVigna unguiculata 3aokra 3aAnoplocnemis curvipes 3acowpeas 3ainsect pests 3acultural control 3aplanting date 3aplant pests 3acrop yield 3aRiptortus dentipes 3aintercropping 3ainsect control 3aClavigralla tomentosicollis 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 3aNigeria 0acrop production1 aOlatunde, G.O.0 tJournal of agricultural science.g2006 Aug., v. 144, no. 4 p.361-368dCambridge University Pressx0021-85967nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00218596060062773electronic resource  a20060912b20061003c00000000  aINDdMKSe2006/09/12  aNon-US 7aarticle03854naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100001700161245013600178300001600314500001500330520237500345650002802720650002302748650002102771650002202792650001902814650001802833650001102851650002302862650001902885650002402904650002602928650002302954650002302977650002503000651000903025651001803034653001703052653002003069700001603089700002003105700001503125700001703140773008903157852000903246930003303255945002503288946001103313655001203324IND4370206920221120151056.0050515e20050510xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437020692DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aGordon, E.R.10aPersistence of elevated rabies prevention costs following post-epizootic declines in rates of rabies among raccoons (Procyon lotor)  ap. 195-222.  a2019-12-05  aDetermining the benefits to cost relationships among different approaches to rabies control and prevention has been hindered by the inherent temporal variability in the dynamics of disease among wildlife reservoir hosts and a tangible and objective measure of the cost of rabies prevention. A major and unavoidable component of rabies prevention programs involves diagnostic testing of animals and the subsequent initiation of appropriate public health responses. The unit cost per negative and positive diagnostic test outcome can be reasonably estimated. This metric when linked to methodologies subdividing the epizootic process into distinct temporal stages provided the requisite detail to estimate benefits derived from rabies control strategies. Oral rabies vaccine (ORV), for prevention of the raccoon-associated variant of rabies, has been distributed in Ohio and adjoining states in an effort to develop an immune barrier to the westward spread of epizootic raccoon rabies. The costs of ORV delivery have been quantified. Herein, the cost structures required to assess the benefits accrued by prevention were developed. A regression model was developed effectively predicting (r2 = 0.70) the total number of rabies diagnostic tests performed by 53 counties in five northeastern (NE) states from 1992 to 2001. Five temporal stages sufficed to capture the range of variability in the raccoon rabies epizootic process. Unit costs, dollars per diagnostic test outcome, were calculated for negative and positive results from published reports. Ohio counties were matched to NE counties based on similar socioeconomic characters. A "pseudo-epizootic" of raccoon rabies was introduced into Ohio and the costs savings from ORV were derived as the excess costs imposed by epizootic spread throughout the state. At 46 km/year (range modeled, 30-60 km/year), the pseudo epizootic spread, and reached the enzootic stage, in all Ohio counties by year 13 (range modeled, 11-17 years). Cumulative excess costs for Ohio ranged between $11 and $21 million; counties of low socioeconomic status experienced the greatest relative excess costs. The costs for rabies prevention activities reached apices during the epizootic stage of raccoon rabies (2.7-10.8 times baseline) an unforeseen finding indicated elevated costs persisted (1.7-7.2 times baseline) into the enzootic stage. 3aepidemiological studies 3adisease reservoirs 3aoral vaccination 3aRabies lyssavirus 3adisease course 3aProcyon lotor 3arabies 3adisease prevention 3aeconomic costs 3aregression analysis 3acost benefit analysis 3aeconometric models 3acost effectiveness 3adisease surveillance 3aOhio 0aUnited States 0aRabies virus 0adisease control1 aKrebs, J.W.1 aRupprecht, C.R.1 aReal, L.A.1 aChilds, J.E.0 tPreventive veterinary medicine.g2005  10, v. 68, no. 2-4 p.195-222x0167-58777nnas  aDNAL  a20060929b20061003c00000000  aINDd4CTe2006/06/05  aNon-US 7aarticle02328naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139100001700157245005700174300001400231500002400245520087200269650001201141650001701153650002001170650000901190650001801199650002801217650002101245650001401266650003001280650002901310650002601339650000901365650001201374650000901386650002601395650003801421650002201459650001101481650002501492650004901517650002601566650001701592773013801609852000901747856007801756655001201834IND4471874420221120151009.0130913s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447187442DNAL7 a127400582pmid7 a10.1079/PNS20022372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRennert, Gad10aDiet and cancer: where are we and where are we going  ap. 59-62.  aIncludes references  aMany studies have shown that overall dietary patterns, dietary components consumed, or mode of food preparation are all possibly relevant in either reducing or increasing the risk of cancer in animals or man. Yet, dietary intervention studies, stemming from laboratory and epidemiological observational studies have often failed to demonstrate the anticipated protection against cancer. One possible explanation for the discrepancy between the results of various observational and experimental chemo-prevention studies is the lack of control for biological diversity of the participants of these studies. It is suggested that future epidemiological studies provide evidence stratified by status of major metabolic polymorphisms pertinent to the study subject, and that future intervention studies take these differences into account in the design and analysis phases. 3aanimals 3abiodiversity 3achemoprevention 3adiet 3aeating habits 3aepidemiological studies 3afood preparation 3aneoplasms 3anutrition risk assessment 3anutritional intervention 3aobservational studies 3arisk 2aAnimals 2aDiet 2aEpidemiologic Methods 2aGenetic Predisposition to Disease 2aGenetic Variation 2aHumans 2aIntervention Studies 2aNeoplasmsxepidemiologyxetiologyxgenetics. 2aPolymorphism, Genetic 2aRisk Factors0 tProceedings of the Nutrition Society.g2003 Feb., v. 62, no. 1 p.59-62dCABI Pub. on behalf of the Nutrition Societyx0029-66517nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1079/PNS20022373Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03660naa a2200565 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001500133245007200148300001800220520207900238650001902317650001402336650001402350650001802364650002402382650002002406650002002426650002502446650000802471650000902479650001002488650004302498650004102541650002502582650006502607650000902672650002202681650001102703650000902714650001602723650002402739650001702763650003902780700001902819700001702838700002002855700001802875700001802893773009502911852001303006939003303019945000803052946001303060852000903073655001203082991615789150742620221120100327.0930608e19930520xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI930017902DNAL7 a84794642pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRimm, E.B.10aVitamin E consumption and the risk of coronary heart disease in men  ap. 1450-1456.  aBackground. The oxidative modification of low-density lipoproteins increases their incorporation into the arterial intima, an essential step in atherogenesis. Although dietary antioxidants, such as vitamin C, carotene, and vitamin E, have been hypothesized to prevent coronary heart disease, prospective epidemiologic data are sparse. Methods. In 1986, 39,910 U.S. male health professionals 40 to 75 years of age who were free of diagnosed coronary heart disease, diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia completed detailed dietary questionnaires that assessed their usual intake of vitamin C, carotene, and vitamin E in addition to other nutrients. During four years of follow-up, we documented 667 cases of coronary disease. Results. After controlling for age and several coronary risk factors, we observed a lower risk of coronary disease among men with higher intakes of vitamin E (P for trend = 0.003). For men consuming more than 60 IU per day of vitamin E, the multivariate relative risk was 0.64 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.49 to 0.83) as compared with those consuming less than 7.5 IU per day. As compared with men who did not take vitamin E supplements, men who took at least 100 IU per day for at least two years had a multivariate relative risk of coronary disease of 0.63 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.47 to 0.84). Carotene intake was not associated with a lower risk of coronary disease among those who had never smoked, but it was inversely associated with the risk among current smokers (relative risk, 0.30; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.11 to 0.82) and former smokers (relative risk, 0.60; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.38 to 0.94). In contrast, a high intake of vitamin C was not associated with a lower risk of coronary disease. Conclusions. These data do not prove a causal relation, but they provide evidence of an association between a high intake of vitamin E and a lower risk of coronary heart disease in men. Public policy recommendations with regard to the use of vitamin E supplements should await the results of additional studies. 3aheart diseases 3avitamin E 3acarotenes 3aascorbic acid 3avitamin supplements 3anutrient intake 3asmoking (habit) 3alongitudinal studies 3amen 3arisk 2aAdult 2aAscorbic Acidxadministration & dosage 2aCarotenoidsxadministration & dosage 2aConfidence Intervals 2aCoronary Diseasexetiologyxmortalityxprevention & control. 2aDiet 2aFollow-Up Studies 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aProspective Studies 2aRisk Factors 2aVitamin Exadministration & dosage1 aStampfer, M.J.1 aAscherio, A.1 aGiovannucci, E.1 aColditz, G.A.1 aWillett, W.C.0 tNew England journal of medicine.g1993 May 20, v. 328, no. 20 p.1450-1456x0028-47937nnas  aDNAL FNC  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aOther US  aDNAL 7aarticle02233naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245013000163300001600293520098600309650002501295650001301320650001801333650001501351650002201366650002001388650002701408651001401435653002601449653003401475653002901509700001801538773010301556852000901659856008501668930003301753945001301786946001301799990002301812655001201835IND2163851220221120085855.0980904e199712  cau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND216385122DNAL7 a10.1177/1077727X9702620032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRolling, P.C.14aThe influence of open-mindedness and knowledge on attitudes toward teen pregnancy among family and consumer sciences teachers  ap. 141-159.  aThe purpose of this study was to determine the influence of knowledge about teenage pregnancy/parenting and open-mindedness on the attitudes of family and consumer sciences (FCS) teachers toward teenage pregnancy/parenting. A simple random sample of 200 FCS teachers in Louisiana was selected from the population. Data were collected by mailed questionnaire. Multiple regression analysis was used to identify a model that explained 26.4% of the variance in teachers' attitudes. Variables that contributed significantly to the model included open-mindedness/dogmatism, number of pregnant teens taught, number of in-service programs attended, age, whether teacher was married, and whether teacher was widowed. The hypotheses that teachers with higher knowledge scores and higher levels of open-mindedness would have more positive attitudes were supported. Conclusions serve to validate FCS programs. Recommendations for improvement of programs and for future research are identified. 3apregnant adolescents 3ateachers 3aparental role 3ademography 3ateacher education 3arural sociology 3aattitudes and opinions 3aLouisiana 0asociological analysis 0astudent teacher relationships 0ahome economics education1 aBurnett, M.F.0 tFamily and consumer sciences research journal.g1997 Dec., v. 26, no. 2 p.141-159x1077-727X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1077727X9702620033Available from publisher's Web site  a19981102b19981110c00000000  aINDdTHW  aOther US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02839naa a2200577 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100002200133245013900155300001600294300003000310520106600340650002501406650001401431650002401445650002201469650002501491650001501516650001001531650001001541650002101551650003601572650001101608650009101619650002801710650001101738650000901749650001701758650007101775651001101846651001101857653002301868653002001891700002401911700002501935700002101960700002301981700002102004700001902025700002502044700002402069773009302093852000902186930003302195945000802228946001302236655001202249991615787480742620221120075439.0810219e19800821xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI810004922DNAL7 a73932702pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCorash, Laurence.10aReduced chronic hemolysis during high-dose vitamin E administration in Mediterranean-type glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency  ap. 416-420.  ap. 416-420. ill., charts.  aExperimental vitamin E therapy was investigated in 23 Greek patients suffering Mediterranean-type glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (G6PD).

A consistently lower level of serum vitamin E was also noted. Treatment was 800IV of d1-alpha-tocopherol acetate, administered orally, for at least 90 days; tests were repeated at this point. Followup was done for 13 patients for one year. Results after 90 days showed that 18 patients had increased hemoglobin; there were no hemolytic crises or intolerance to vitamin dosage reported. The mean increase of red cell half-life was from 22.9 to 25.1 days; early cell loss remained fairly constant at 4%. After one year, results were much the same for reticulocyte count, packed cell volume and serum vitamin E. The mean increase in hemoglobin concentration was 1.3 g/dl. 3ahematologic diseases 3avitamin E 3aenzyme deficiencies 3ahematologic tests 2aAdministration, Oral 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aChild 2aChild, Preschool 2aErythrocyte Agingxdrug effects 2aFemale 2aGlucosephosphate Dehydrogenase Deficiencyxclassificationxdrug therapyxepidemiology. 2aHemolysisxdrug effects 2aHumans 2aMale 2aTime Factors 2aVitamin Exadministration & dosagexpharmacologyxtherapeutic use. 3aGreece 0aGreece 0aHereditary factors 0aVitamin therapy1 aSpielberg, Stephen.1 aBartsocas, Christos.1 aBoxer, Laurence.1 aSteinherz, Reuven.1 aSheetz, Michael.1 aEgan, Michael.1 aSchlessleman, James.1 aSchulman, Joseph D.0 tNew England journal of medicine.g1980 Aug. 21, v. 303, no. 8 p.416-420x0028-47937nnas  aDNAL  a20050114b00000000c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle02975naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004100111040001800152100001500170245007500185300001800260500002400278520179700302650001602099650001402115650001102129650001102140650001502151650001002166650002902176650002002205651001502225651001102240651001302251651001002264651001102274651001802285700002102303700001402324773011502338852000902453856009102462655001202553IND4423908120221120075426.0090731s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442390812DNAL7 a195594652pmid7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2009.05.0462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShi, Chune10aContributors to ozone episodes in three U.S./Mexico border twin-cities  ap. 5128-5138.  aIncludes references  aThe Process Analysis tools of the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) modeling system together with back-trajectory analysis were used to assess potential contributors to ozone episodes that occurred during June 1-4, 2006, in three populated U.S.-Mexico border twin cities: San Diego/Tijuana, Imperial/Mexicali and El Paso/Ciudad Juárez. Validation of CMAQ output against surface ozone measurements indicates that the predictions are acceptable with regard to commonly recommended statistical standards and comparable to other reported studies. The mean normalized bias test (MNBT) and mean normalized gross error (MNGE) for hourly ozone fall well within the US EPA suggested range of ±15% and 35%, respectively, except MNBT for El Paso. The MNBTs for maximum 8-h average ozone are larger than those for hourly ozone, but all the simulated maximum 8-h average ozone are within a factor of 2 of those measured in all three regions. The process and back-trajectory analyses indicate that the main sources of daytime ground-level ozone are the local photochemical production and regional transport. By integrating the effects of each process over the depth of the daytime planetary boundary layer (PBL), it is found that in the San Diego area (SD), chemistry and vertical advection contributed about 36%/48% and 64%/52% for June 2 and 3, respectively. This confirms the previous finding that high-altitude regional transport followed by fumigation contributes significantly to ozone in SD. The back-trajectory analysis shows that this ozone was mostly transported from the coastal area of southern California. For the episodes in Imperial Valley and El Paso, respectively, ozone was transported from the coastal areas of southern California and Mexico and from northern Texas and Oklahoma. 3aair quality 3achemistry 3acities 3acoasts 3afumigation 3aozone 2aAir Pollutantsxanalysis 2aOzonexanalysis 3aCalifornia 3aMexico 3aOklahoma 3aTexas 0aMexico 0aUnited States1 aFernando, H.J.S.1 aYang, Jie0 tScience of the total environment.g2009 Sept. 1, v. 407, no. 18 p.5128-5138dElsevier Sciencex0048-96977nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2009.05.0463Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02878naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004100111040001800152100001700170245009900187300001800286500002400304520145800328650001301786650001101799650001901810650001601829650001301845650000901858650001301867650000901880650001401889650001301903650001101916650000701927650003301934650001201967650001001979650001801989650002202007650003502029650001002064650001902074700002402093700001502117700002502132773011502157852000902272856009102281655001202372IND4423907920221120065658.0090731s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442390792DNAL7 a195399792pmid7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2009.05.0392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSuer, Pascal10aReproducing ten years of road ageing -- Accelerated carbonation and leaching of EAF steel slag  ap. 5110-5118.  aIncludes references  aReuse of industrial aggregates is still hindered by concern for their long-term properties. This paper proposes a laboratory method for accelerated ageing of steel slag, to predict environmental and technical properties, starting from fresh slag. Ageing processes in a 10-year old asphalt road with steel slag of electric arc furnace (EAF) type in the subbase were identified by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and leaching tests. Samples from the road centre and the pavement edge were compared with each other and with samples of fresh slag. It was found that slag from the pavement edge showed traces of carbonation and leaching processes, whereas the road centre material was nearly identical to fresh slag, in spite of an accessible particle structure. Batches of moisturized road centre material exposed to oxygen, nitrogen or carbon dioxide (CO₂) were used for accelerated ageing. Time (7-14 days), temperature (20-40 °C) and initial slag moisture content (8-20%) were varied to achieve the carbonation (decrease in pH) and leaching that was observed in the pavement edge material. After ageing, water was added to assess leaching of metals and macroelements. 12% moisture, CO₂ and seven days at 40 °C gave the lowest pH value. This also reproduced the observed ageing effect for Ca, Cu, Ba, Fe, Mn, Pb, Ca (decreased leaching) and for V, Si, and Al (increased leaching). However, ageing effects on SO₄, DOC and Cr were not reproduced. 3aaluminum 3abarium 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbonation 3achromium 3airon 3aleaching 3alead 3amanganese 3anitrogen 3aoxygen 3apH 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asilicon 3asteel 3awater content 2aCarbonxchemistry 2aMicroscopy, Electron, Scanning 2aSteel 2aTransportation1 aLindqvist, Jan-Erik1 aArm, Maria1 aFrogner-Kockum, Paul0 tScience of the total environment.g2009 Sept. 1, v. 407, no. 18 p.5110-5118dElsevier Sciencex0048-96977nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2009.05.0393Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01617naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001300145245008500158300001600243520065200259650001900911650002000930650002000950650002000970650001900990773011801009852000901127856008501136930003301221945001301254946001301267990002301280655001201303IND2196571920221120041829.0990121e199806  cau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219657192DNAL7 a10.1177/1077727X9802640042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShim, S.14aThe changing marketplace in the global economy: implications for future research  ap. 444-461.  aThe purpose of this article is to discuss directions for future research in the consumer, merchandising and retailing field.

Mechanical impedance restricted root elongation in every treatment including the finer sands in which longest roots were found, but it was greatest in the coarse sands, where crooked swollen roots similar in shape to the pore channels were produced. Straight evenly tapered roots were formed in the fine sands due to a more balanced stress distribution over the root tip. Interpretations of penetrometer measurements differed in coarse and fine sands. 'Aeration effects' were distinguished from mechanical impedance effects by comparing the root lengths expected (mechanical impedance and aeration acting together), and they occurred in sands with less than 25 percent gas-filled pore space. No effect due to water availability could be found. 3asilica 3agrasses 3apeas 3aaeration 3aseedlings 3acorn 3asoil physical properties 3awater content 3aroot growth 3aroots 0aimpedance1 aEavis, B.W.0 tPlant and soil.g1972 June, v. 36, no. 3 p.623-634wJournal:jnl49373x0032-079X7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19721001c00000000  aIND 7aarticle03014naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004100111040001800152100001600170245013500186300001800321500002400339520155500363650001701918650001101935650002501946650002301971650001401994650002602008650001202034650001402046650001102060650002502071650001502096650001102111650001702122650002502139650001802164650002102182650003902203650002102242650001102263700002102274700002202295773011502317852000902432856009102441655001202532IND4423906320221120041744.0090731s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442390632DNAL7 a195594672pmid7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2009.06.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Ze-hua10aUrinary excretion rates of natural estrogens and androgens from humans, and their occurrence and fate in the environment: A review  ap. 4975-4985.  aIncludes references  aEndocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) are pollutants with estrogenic or androgenic activities at very low concentrations and are emerging as a major concern for water quality. For sewage of municipal wastewater treatment plants in cities, one of the most important sources of EDCs are natural estrogens and natural androgens (NEAs) excreted from humans. Therefore, estrogenic/androgenic potencies or relative binding affinity of the NEAs were first outlined from different sources, and data of urinary excretion rates of NEAs were summarized. To evaluate their estrogenic activities, their excretion rates of estrogen equivalent (EEQ) or testosterone (T) equivalent (TEQ) were also calculated. Based on our summary, the total excretion rates of EEQ by estrone (E1), 17β-estradiol (E2), and estriol (E3) only accounted for 66-82% of the total excretion rate of EEQ among four different groups, and the other corresponding natural estrogens contributed 18-34%, which meant that some of the other natural estrogens may also exist in wastewater with high estrogenic activities. Based on the contribution ratio of individual androgens to the total excretion rate of TEQ, five out of 12 natural androgens, T, dihydrotestosterone (DHT), androsterone (AD), 5β-androstanediol (β-ADL), and androstenediol (ANL) were evaluated as the priority natural androgens, which may exist in wastewater with high androgenic activities. Published data on occurrence and fate of the NEAs including natural estrogen conjugates in the environment were also summarized here. 3aandrosterone 3acities 3aconjugated estrogens 3aenvironmental fate 3aestradiol 3aestrogenic properties 3aestrone 3aexcretion 3ahumans 3amunicipal wastewater 3apollutants 3asewage 3atestosterone 3awastewater treatment 3awater quality 2aAndrogensxurine 2aEnvironmental Pollutantsxanalysis 2aEstrogensxurine 2aHumans1 aKanjo, Yoshinori1 aMizutani, Satoshi0 tScience of the total environment.g2009 Sept. 1, v. 407, no. 18 p.4975-4985dElsevier Sciencex0048-96977nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2009.06.0013Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03001naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002200145245015400167300001600321500002400337520172200361650001002083650001402093650000902107650000902116650001102125650002102136650001802157650002502175650001102200650002102211650001402232650002702246650001502273650002902288650001402317650001602331650001202347650001102359650001202370773011602382852000902498856004802507655001202555IND4428372820221120052643.0091106e200910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442837282DNAL7 a10.1007/s11627-008-9190-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThomas, T.

Protoplasts were isolated from leaf mesophyll cells and cultured at a density of 5 × 10⁵ protoplasts per gram fresh weight, which is required for the highest frequency of protoplast division (33.7%) and plating efficiency (9.3%). The first division was observed 2 d after plating and the second division after 4 d. Culture medium consists of Murashige and Skoog (MS) liquid medium with 4 μM 2,4-D, 0.4 M mannitol and 3% (w/v) sucrose with pH adjusted to 5.8. After 45 d of culture at 25°C in the dark, protoplasts formed colonies consisting of about 100 cells. The protoplast-derived microcalli were visible to the naked eye within 60 d of culture and reached a size of 0.2-0.4 mm in diameter after 90 d. Calli of 0.2-0.4-mm size were transferred to MS medium supplemented with 2,4-D (4 µM), 3% (w/v) sucrose and 0.8% (w/v) agar, formed friable organogenic calli (7-8 mm size) after 8 wk under incubation in normal light period supplemented with 200 µmol m⁻² S⁻¹ of day light fluorescent illumination. The calli were transferred to MS medium supplemented with thidiazuron (TDZ) (1-7 μM) and naphthalene acetic acid (NAA) (0.2-0.4 μM) for regeneration. The calli developed shoot buds after 3-4 wk, and the frequencies of calli-forming shoots varied from 5% to 44%. Optimum shoot regeneration occurred on MS medium supplemented with 5 μM TDZ and 0.4 μM NAA. On this medium, 44% cultures responded with an average number of 12 shoots per callus. Whole plants were recovered following rooting of shoots in 1/2 MS medium supplemented with 3 μM indole 3-butyric acid. 3a2,4-D 3aTylophora 3aagar 3abuds 3acallus 3acallus formation 3aculture media 3afluorescent lighting 3aleaves 3amedicinal plants 3amesophyll 3anaphthaleneacetic acid 3aphotophase 3aplant cultural practices 3aplantlets 3aprotoplasts 3arooting 3ashoots 3asucrose0 tIn vitro cellular & developmental biology.g2009 Oct., v. 45, no. 5 p.591-598dSpringer-Verlagx1054-54767nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11627-008-9190-6 7aarticle02540naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002700145245013300172300001800305520130700323650001301630650001601643650002101659650001401680650002201694650001001716650001301726650002401739650001101763650001101774650001201785651001501797651001101812653002401823653002701847773011801874852000901992856008502001930003302086946001102119655001202130IND4424976320221123015756.0090821e200909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442497632DNAL7 a10.1007/s10040-009-0473-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJaworska-Szulc, Beata 10aGroundwater flow modelling of multi-aquifer systems for regional resources evaluation: the Gdansk hydrogeological system, Poland  ap. 1521-1542.  aIn order to evaluate groundwater regional resources, a mathematical model of the Gdansk hydrogeological system (Poland) was developed. The research area covers about 2,800 km². Groundwater occurs in Cretaceous, Paleogene and Neogene formations. The recharge zone is situated in the glacial upland of the Kashubian Lake District. The discharge zone spreads over the lowlands of Gdansk and beneath the Bay of Gdansk (Baltic Sea). The MODFLOW program was used to develop a three-dimensional steady-state model on the basis of data from over 1,700 boreholes. The research area was digitalized as a square network of sides 200 m in length. Simplification of groundwater occurrence allowed four aquifers to be distinguished: upper Pleistocene, Pleistocene-Miocene, Oligocene-Eocene, and Cretaceous and also four intervening aquitards. The mathematical model calculations showed that the system is recharged mainly by precipitation (infiltration recharge is 136 mm/year). The precipitation recharge amounts to 1,045,440 m³/day. The other part of the inflow constitutes lateral flows from beyond the area of research and also to some extent from losing rivers and lakes. The runoff from the system takes place mainly through gaining streams and through lateral outflow including under-sea and lake discharge. 3aaquifers 3agroundwater 3agroundwater flow 3ahighlands 3ahydrologic models 3alakes 3alowlands 3amathematical models 3arivers 3arunoff 3astreams 3aBaltic Sea 3aPoland 0aNumerical modelling 0aGroundwater management0 tHydrogeology journal.g2009 Sept., v. 17, no. 6 p.1521-1542dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx1431-21747nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10040-009-0473-83Available from publisher's Web site  a20090821b00000000c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03032naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245011100164300001800275500002400293520149000317650002801807650001601835650002101851650002301872650002701895650002201922650001101944650002201955650001201977650001001989650002401999650002102023650002402044650000702068650001702075650001302092650002602105650002202131650001102153700001702164700001602181700001602197700001602213700001802229700001402247700001902261773012802280852000902408856008502417655001202502IND4424359820221123002242.0090808s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442435982DNAL7 a10.1007/s11274-009-0048-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDai, Jianghong10aCloning of a novel levoglucosan kinase gene from Lipomyces starkeyi and its expression in Escherichia coli  ap. 1589-1595.  aIncludes references  aLevoglucosan, cellulosic pyrolysate, is converted to glucose-6-phosphate by a specific levoglucosan kinase in fungi. A novel cDNA of levoglucosan kinase gene (lgk) from yeast Lipomyces starkeyi YZ-215 was isolated by RACE method. The 1,445 bp cDNA fragment (lgk) harbouring the kinase gene exhibited one open reading frame (ORF) composed of 1,317 bp flanked by a 14 bp 5'-UTR and a 114 bp 3'-UTR, including a 25 bp poly(A) tail. The ORF encoded a 439 amino acid polypeptide with a 48.4 kDa predicted molecular mass. Analysis of amino sequence revealed that the kinase belonged to the bacterial anhydro-N-acetylmuramic acid kinase (AnmK) family, and kinase-like proteins existed in some fungi, especially in filamentous fungi such as Aspergillus. The kinase gene was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3), recombinant E. coli could grow in M9 minimal medium with levoglucosan as a sole carbon source when induced by IPTG. In addition, the recombinant kinase was overexpressed, purified and characterized. The kinase was stable at pH 7-10 and showed maximum activity at 30°C and pH 9.0 as natural kinase, but presented higher thermostability. Kinetic constants (apparent K m values) for LG and ATP were 105.3 ± 12.5 and 0.20 ± 0.02 mM, respectively. Furthermore, the kinase showed substrate specificity for LG. This novel levoglucosan kinase gene would be useful in constructing recombinant microbial strains for the efficient bioconversion of cellulosic pyrolysate to ethanol. 3a3' untranslated regions 3aAspergillus 3aEscherichia coli 3aLipomyces starkeyi 3aadenosine triphosphate 3abiotransformation 3acarbon 3acomplementary DNA 3aethanol 3agenes 3aglucose 6-phosphate 3amolecular weight 3aopen reading frames 3apH 3apolypeptides 3aproteins 3asubstrate specificity 3athermal stability 3ayeasts1 aYu, Zhisheng1 aHe, Yongzhi1 aZhang, Ling1 aBai, Zhihui1 aDong, Zhiyang1 aDu, Yuguo1 aZhang, Hongxun0 tWorld journal of microbiology & biotechnology.g2009 Sept., v. 25, no. 9 p.1589-1595dSpringer Netherlandsx0959-39937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11274-009-0048-93Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02067naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245006800163300001600231520103300247650002301280650001501303650001901318650002601337650001901363650001101382700002201393700002201415700001901437773013501456852000901591856008501600930003301685946001101718655001201729IND4424984320221122225411.0090821e200909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442498432DNAL7 a10.1007/s00216-009-2844-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWallin, Sara 10aLaser-based standoff detection of explosives: a critical review  ap. 259-274.  aA review of standoff detection technologies for explosives has been made. The review is focused on trace detection methods (methods aiming to detect traces from handling explosives or the vapours surrounding an explosive charge due to the vapour pressure of the explosive) rather than bulk detection methods (methods aiming to detect the bulk explosive charge). The requirements for standoff detection technologies are discussed. The technologies discussed are mostly laser-based trace detection technologies, such as laser-induced-breakdown spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, laser-induced-fluorescence spectroscopy and IR spectroscopy but the bulk detection technologies millimetre wave imaging and terahertz spectroscopy are also discussed as a complement to the laser-based methods. The review includes novel techniques, not yet tested in realistic environments, more mature technologies which have been tested outdoors in realistic environments as well as the most mature millimetre wave imaging technique.

AMF colonization was highest during vegetative growth, with values declining during the growing season to the same level seen at plant dormancy. AMF colonization was reduced at lower depths in the sediments where anoxic conditions were observed and in plants treated with the systemic fungicide Benomyl. Only small changes in diversity of nitrogen-fixing bacteria in general and more specifically of those belonging to the ε-subdivision of Proteobacteria were detected during the season or between treatments by PCR-RFLP of nifH gene fragments with DNA as template for amplification; however, greater seasonal changes were displayed when cDNA was used as template for amplification as a proxy for gene expression and thus active bacteria. DGGE analyses of nifH gene fragments representing nitrogen-fixing bacteria of the ε-subdivision of Proteobacteria using both using DNA and cDNA as template showed highly diverse profiles that changed during the season and in response to treatment. Seasonal changes were observed for a suite of plant growth attributes and differences were observed between treatments, with higher values generally obtained on non-treated plants compared to Benomyl-treated plants. These differences were most pronounced during vegetative growth; however, differences between non-treated and Benomyl-treated plants were reduced seasonally and disappeared by the onset of senescence. This study demonstrates seasonal changes in AMF colonization on S. patens and in the community structure of nitrogen-fixing members of the ε-subdivision of Proteobacteria in the plant root zone. Plant growth performance changed seasonally with some effects of Benomyl-treatment. 3adenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis 3anitrogen-fixing bacteria 3avesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae 3amycorrhizal fungi 3aseasonal variation 3agenes 3abenomyl 3aroots 3asediments 3arhizosphere 3areproduction 3agene expression 3adormancy 3agrasses 3aanaerobic conditions 3acommunity structure 3acomplementary DNA 3aProteobacteria 3arhizosphere bacteria 3agrowth performance 3asalt marshes 3avegetative growth 3asalt marsh plants 3afungicides 3agrowing season 3aSpartina patens 0asenescence1 aBurke, David J.1 aHamerlynck, Erik P.1 aHahn, Dittmar0 tPlant and soil.g2010 May, v. 330, no. 1-2 p.251-266dSpringer Netherlandsx0032-079X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-009-0197-5 7aarticle02487naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002100164245008300185300001800268500002400286520067600310650001800986650001801004650000901022650002101031650002401052650002701076650001601103650002501119650001301144650001201157650001501169650001401184650004601198650001601244650002401260650002501284650002501309650004201334650007001376650001301446650003101459650004901490650002401539650002801563650002301591700003101614700002101645700002201666700002301688773010401711852000901815856008501824655001201909IND4424342720221122153206.0090808s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442434272DNAL7 a195438582pmid7 a10.1007/s10529-009-0033-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlvarez, Rubén.10aGenetic transformation of cork oak (Quercus suber L.) for herbicide resistance  ap. 1477-1483.  aIncludes references  aThe bar gene was introduced into the cork oak genome.

In plant cells, CDS isozymes are located in plastids, mitochondria, and microsomes. Here, we show that these isozymes are encoded by five genes in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Alternative translation initiation or alternative splicing of CDS2 and CDS4 transcripts can result in up to 10 isoforms. Most of the cDNAs encoding the various plant isoforms were functionally expressed in yeast and rescued the nonviable phenotype of the mutant strain lacking CDS activity. The closely related genes CDS4 and CDS5 were found to encode plastidial isozymes with similar catalytic properties. Inactivation of both genes was required to obtain Arabidopsis mutant lines with a visible phenotype, suggesting that the genes have redundant functions. Analysis of these Arabidopsis mutants provided further independent evidence for the importance of plastidial phosphatidylglycerol for structure and function of thylakoid membranes and, hence, for photoautotrophic growth.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aalternative splicing 3acomplementary DNA 3agenes 3aisozymes 3amitochondria 3amutants 3aphenotype 3athylakoids 3ayeasts 2aAlleles 2aArabidopsisxenzymologyxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxultrastructure. 2aAutotrophic Processesxdrug effectsxgeneticsxradiation effects. 2aDNA, Bacterialxgenetics 2aDiacylglycerol Cholinephosphotransferasexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGenes, Plantxgenetics 2aGenetic Complementation Test 2aGlycerophospholipidsxbiosynthesis 2aIsoenzymesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aLight 2aMembrane Lipidsxmetabolism 2aMutagenesis, Insertionalxdrug effectsxgeneticsxradiation effects. 2aMutationxgenetics 2aPhenotype 2aPlastidsxenzymologyxgeneticsxradiation effectsxultrastructure. 2aProtein Transportxdrug effectsxradiation effects. 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexcytologyxdrug effectsxmetabolismxradiation effects. 2aSubcellular Fractionsxdrug effectsxenzymologyxradiation effects. 2aSucrosexpharmacology1 aAkbari, Hana1 aWeth, Agnes1 aBaumgartner, Werner1 aFrentzen, Margrit0 tPlant physiology.g2010 July, v. 153, no. 3 p.1372-1384dAmerican Society of Plant Biologistsx0032-08897nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1104/pp.110.1564223Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03137naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001900164245009500183300001600278500002400294520161300318650001201931650001001943650001601953650001301969650003701982650001002019650002002029650001402049650001802063650002102081650001202102650001202114650003002126650002202156650002502178650001302203650001402216650004702230650000902277650003002286650002602316650002302342700002302365700001702388700002402405700002002429773008902449852000902538856004802547655001202595IND4433914320221122071048.0100313e201004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443391432DNAL7 a190528802pmid7 a10.1007/s10709-008-9335-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEkblom, Robert10aBalancing selection, sexual selection and geographic structure in MHC genes of Great Snipe  ap. 453-461.  aIncludes references  aSignatures of balancing selection are often found when investigating the extremely polymorphic regions of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes, and it is generally accepted that selective forces maintain this polymorphism. However, the exact nature of the selection is controversial. Theoretical studies have mainly focused on overdominance and/or frequency dependent selection while laboratory studies have emphasised the role of mate choice. Empirical field data, on the other hand, have been relatively scarce. Previously we have found that geographic structure in MHC class II genes of the Great Snipe (Gallinago media) is too pronounced to be explained by neutral forces alone. Here we test the hypothesis that sexual selection on MHC alleles may be influencing this geographic structure between mountain and lowland populations. We found evidence of balancing selection acting on MHC genes in the form of a higher rate of amino-acid changing substitutions compared to silent substitutions in the peptide binding regions. Not only natural selection but also sexual selection may influence MHC polymorphism in this bird because certain MHC alleles have been found to be associated with higher male mating success. Contrary to predictions from negative frequency dependent selection, males carrying locally rare alleles did not have a mating advantage. Instead, the mating success of alleles in a mountain population was positively correlated to their relative frequency in the mountains compared to the lowlands, implying that locally adapted MHC alleles may also be favoured by sexual selection. 3aalleles 3abirds 3acorrelation 3alowlands 3amajor histocompatibility complex 3amales 3amating behavior 3amountains 3aoverdominance 3asexual selection 2aAlleles 2aAnimals 2aCharadriiformesxgenetics 2aGenetic Variation 2aGenetics, Population 2aGenotype 2aGeography 2aMajor Histocompatibility Complexxgenetics 2aMale 2aMating Preference, Animal 2aPolymorphism, Genetic 2aSelection, Genetic1 aSæther, Stein Are1 aFiske, Peder1 aKålås, John Atle.1 aHöglund, Jacob0 tGenetica.g2010 Apr., v. 138, no. 4 p.453-461dSpringer Netherlandsx0016-67077nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10709-008-9335-x 7aarticle01573naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245011800158300001800276520045200294592002800746650001200774650002300786650002300809650002300832650001200855650002700867650001400894700001700908700001600925700001900941700001500960700001900975773013400994856007401128852000901202655001201211IND60639123020221120053238.0190501e20170411xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063912302DNAL7 a10.1039/c7cc01488k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Zhiwei10aEnantioselective construction of quaternary tetrahydropyridines by palladium-catalyzed vinylborylation of alkenes  ap. 4270-4273.  aHere, the highly enantioselective construction of 3,3-disubstituted tetrahydropyridines via Pd(0)-catalyzed asymmetric vinylborylation of (Z)-1-iodo-dienes and B₂pin₂ in the presence of a (S)-p-CF₃-BnPHOX ligand is reported.

We examined the effects of freezing on these species with chlorophyll fluorescence and electrolyte leakage using both field- and laboratory-based experiments in September 2009 and January 2010, respectively. We found that freezing could cause a greater impact on the Loblolly pine than the Masson pine. Although the two species showed similar values of Fᵥ/Fₘ and electrolyte leakage before freezing, the Masson pine needles showed lower Fᵥ/Fₘ and higher electrolyte leakage ratios than those of the Loblolly pine when treated in low temperatures (−15 to 0°C). We also found that cold-acclimation was crucial for both species to adapt to low temperatures with the Fᵥ/Fₘ ratio decreased approximately by 80% in the first freezing hour for the non-acclimated needles of both species while the cold-acclimated needles showed little changes in the Fᵥ/Fₘ ratio. This finding is also supported by our measurements of electrolyte leakage. These results suggest that the Loblolly pine could be more susceptible to freezing damages than the Masson pine in central China.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus massoniana 3aPinus taeda 3achlorophyll 3aconifer needles 3aconifers 3aelectrolytes 3afluorescence 3afreezing 3aindigenous species 3aintroduced species 3atemperate forests 3atemperature 3atrees 3aChina 0aChlorophyll fluorescence 0acold-acclimation 0aelectrolyte leakage 0afreezing damage 0aLoblolly pine 0aMasson pine 0apigments 0asoluble sugar content 0asuperoxide dismutase activity1 aYang, Tunan,1 aXu, Ming1 aChi, Yonggang1 aShen, Ruichang1 aLi, Peixue1 aDai, Huitang0 tScandinavian journal of forest research.g2012 Sept. 1, v. 27, no. 6 p.520-531dTaylor & Francis Groupx1651-18917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02827581.2012.683532  aDNAL 7aarticle01946naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245015300159520093300312592002801245650001501273650001401288650001101302650001001313650001501323651001001338700002001348700001701368700002001385700001301405773011901418856007401537852000901611655001201620IND60768557820221122140927.0220225e20220217xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076855782DNAL7 a10.3390/w140406152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDing, Shaoxuan 10aWater Environmental Functional Zoning at County Level and Environmental Contamination Carrying Capacity Accounting in the Mainstream of Xiaofu River  aWater environmental functional zoning is the crucial method to implement the targeted management of environmental factors, which is significant to protect the structure and function of the water ecosystem. Xiaofu River is the main river in Zibo City, which is a typical industrial city in northern China. This paper analyzes the water functional zoning of the Xiaofu River at the provincial and municipal levels. Thereinto, based on the catchment attribute and differentiated management requirement, the functional zone of the mainstream of Xiaofu River is divided into 5 first-level and 14 s-level water functional zones, where the environmental contamination carrying capacity of every functional zone is calculated and checked. It is suggested that the total amount of pollutants discharged into each functional zones should be further controlled and reduced in the future to restore the ecological functions of Xiaofu River.  aPublisher supplied data 3aecosystems 3apollution 3arivers 3awater 3awatersheds 3aChina1 aWang, Fangshun 1 aSun, Xining 1 aDing, Jincheng 1 aLu, Jie 0 tWater.g2022 Feb. 17, v. 14, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w140406153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02517naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245004800170300001800218520129600236592002801532650002901560650002401589650001601613650002201629650002201651650001301673650002501686650000901711650002301720650002601743650001101769700002101780700002301801700002401824700006201848773011701910856008302027852000902110655001202119IND60643892720221120194352.0190514e20190502xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064389272DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.biochem.9b000792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAloi, Sekotilani10aSubstrate Specificity in Thiol Dioxygenases  ap. 2398-2407.  aThiol dioxygenases make up a class of ferrous iron-dependent enzymes that oxidize thiols to their corresponding sulfinates. X-ray diffraction structures of cysteine-bound cysteine dioxygenase show how cysteine is coordinated via its thiolate and amine to the iron and oriented correctly for O atom transfer. There are currently no structures with 3-mercaptopropionic acid or mercaptosuccinic acid bound to their respective enzymes, 3-mercaptopropionate dioxygenase or mercaptosuccinate dioxygenase. Sequence alignments and comparisons of known structures have led us to postulate key structural features that define substrate specificity. Here, we compare the rates and reactivities of variants of Rattus norvegicus cysteine dioxygenase and 3-mercaptopropionate dioxygenases from Pseudomonas aureginosa and Ralstonia eutropha (JMP134) and show how binary variants of three structural features correlate with substrate specificity and reactivity. They are (1) the presence or absence of a cis-peptide bond between residues Ser158 and Pro159, (2) an Arg or Gln at position 60, and (3) a Cys or Arg at position 164 (all RnCDO numbering). Different permutations of these features allow sulfination of l-cysteine, 3-mercaptopropionic acid, and (R)-mercaptosuccinic acid to be promoted or impeded.  aPublisher supplied data 3a3-mercaptopropionic acid 3aCupriavidus necator 3aPseudomonas 3aRattus norvegicus 3aX-ray diffraction 3acysteine 3acysteine dioxygenase 3airon 3asequence alignment 3asubstrate specificity 3athiols1 aDavies, Casey G.1 aKarplus, P.

Human persecution during migration and habitat loss at stopover and wintering sites are commonly regarded as most serious threats. However, little is known about seasonal movements, migration routes, and wintering sites of the bar-headed geese from Kyrgyzstan, which represent the westernmost geographical population of the species. As part of a conservation project, which also included reinforcement of the wild population by the release of hand-reared juveniles, in late summer of 1998, five bar-headed geese, three wild adults and two hand-reared goslings, were fitted with sun-powered satellite transmitters in order to track their movements from Lake Son Kul and Lake Chatyr Kul in Kyrgyzstan. The five individuals contributed very unevenly to the more than 5,000 signals in total that were received from the French ARGOS system: one failed after 8 weeks, while another one was tracked for more than 2 years. The four geese contributing to this study followed three completely different migration routes leading to their wintering areas in Pakistan, India and Uzbekistan, while stopover areas were situated in southern Tajikistan and in western Tibet. Both in autumn and spring the adult birds migrated distances of 1,280–1,550 km in two steps, with stopover periods of 32–46 days (autumn) and 16–23 days (spring). Flight speeds of up to 680 km per actual migration day were recorded regularly, even during crossings of very high summits. A hand-reared juvenile flew non-stop for 790 km to southern Uzbekistan and even visited southernmost Turkmenistan, where the species is very rarely seen. The timing of migration varied considerably between individuals but also for the same individual between years. We compare our tracking results with previous findings (field observations, ring recoveries, and satellite tracking results) and discuss them with respect to migration over high-mountain habitats and a general migration strategy of the species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnser indicus 3aadults 3aautumn 3aflight 3agoslings 3ahabitat destruction 3ahabitats 3ajuveniles 3alakes 3amigratory behavior 3aradio transmitters 3asatellites 3aspring 3astopover sites 3asummer 3atelemetry 3awintering grounds 3aChina 3aIndia 3aKyrgyzstan 3aPakistan 3aTajikistan 3aTurkmenistan 3aUzbekistan1 aYakovlev, Alexander Petrovich1 aBarth, Raimund1 aKaatz, Michael1 aBerthold, Peter0 tJournal of ornithology.g2010 July, v. 151, no. 3 p.703-712dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000001150x2193-71927nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10336-010-0492-13Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02324naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245016000159300002000319520127300339592002801612650001401640650002301654650001301677650002101690650001901711700001501730700001501745700001101760700002001771773012401791856007401915852000901989655001201998IND60667179020221120122725.0190919e20150216xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066717902DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra15190a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGong, Honghong10aInfluence of less active initiator on the living performance of atom transfer radical polymerization and the structure of the synthesized grafted copolymer  ap. 19117-19127.  aIn an effort to precisely describe the structure of polymers synthesized via ATRP initiated with less active initiator and clearly understand the evolution of the forming polymer chains, methyl methacrylate (MMA) was grafted onto poly(vinylidene fluoride-chlorotrifluoroethylene) (P(VDF-CTFE)) using two different catalysts. The detailed structural information of the grafted copolymers, including the grafting density, the average side chain length, and the average molecular weight and its distribution, has been carefully determined by removing the homopolymers from the crude copolymer and converting any uninitiated Cl atoms into H atoms, which has been finely correlated to the reaction conditions. By correlating the structural information to a kinetic analysis, the step-by-step evolution of the side chains has been clearly demonstrated. The low initiation activity of C–Cl and the low redox capability of the catalyst system were found to be responsible for the wide molecular weight distribution, the low grafting density and the slow growing polymer chains. The results may help to understand not only the polymer structure synthesized from the ATRP process more precisely but also the evolution of the polymer chains under different reaction conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3acomposite polymers 3akinetics 3amolecular weight 3apolymerization1 aLi, Junjie1 aDi, Daming1 aLi, Na1 aZhang, Zhicheng0 tRSC advances.g2015 Feb. 16, v. 5, no. 25 p.19117-19127dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ra15190a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01902naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245013300165300001600298520087400314592002801188650002501216650002601241650001601267650002601283650001901309700001801328700002001346700001601366773011501382852000901497856008201506655001201588IND4438844120221119174008.0190314e201006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443884412DNAL7 a10.1007/s10086-009-1083-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUkyo, Seiichiro10aSimultaneous determination of shear strength and shear modulus in glued-laminated timber using a full-scale shear block specimen  ap. 262-266.  aA newly developed full-scale shear block specimen was used to simultaneously determine the shear strength and shear modulus of glued-laminated timber. The shear modulus was calculated using the shear strain distribution measured by means of digital image correlation. To obtain the exact relationship between shear modulus and shear strength, the shear strain in the intended shear plane was measured. A relatively high correlation coefficient of 0.75 was found between the shear modulus and nominal shear strength in two types of glued-laminated timber tested: sugi (Cryptomeria japonica) and Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii). Good correlation was also found between the density of middle lamina and shear strength. However, the relationships to density showed species dependence, which was not observed in the relationship between shear modulus and shear strength.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCryptomeria japonica 3aPseudotsuga menziesii 3acorrelation 3amodulus of elasticity 3ashear strength1 aIdo, Hirofumi1 aNagao, Hirofumi1 aKato, Hideo0 tJournal of wood science.g2010 June, v. 56, no. 3 p.262-266dSpringer JapanwJournal:jnl56734x1435-02117nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10086-009-1083-83Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02631naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006200148245011300210300001600323520126300339592002801602650001801630650001101648650001801659650000901677650002201686650000901708650001301717650001401730650001501744650001301759650001301772650001901785650001501804650001501819650002001834650002601854700001901880700002601899700002101925700002401946773011101970856008302081852000902164655001202173IND60682825620221123043651.0200324e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068282562DNAL7 a10.1007/s12237-019-00683-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAndolina, Cristina1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2011-640910aVegetated Habitats Trophically Support Early Development Stages of a Marine Migrant Fish in a Coastal Lagoon  ap. 424-437.  aUnderstanding the trophic ecology of early developmental stages of commercial fish species migrating between sea and coastal lagoons is crucial to effective management of nursery habitats and resulting resources. While most information on diet shift of the gilthead seabream Sparus aurata comes from studies in experimental conditions, here we investigated the trophic niche dynamics of post-larvae, juveniles and sub-adults in natural environment, hypothesising that habitat and resources use of marine and lagoonal sites will exhibit strong relationship with ontogeny of the species. Carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes showed evidence of a clear shift in the trophic niche features, trophic position and trophic pathways supporting S. aurata during growth. Main differences occurred between post-larvae and juveniles/sub-adults, perfectly matching their diet shift from zooplanktivorous to zoobenthivorous habits. The wider trophic niche of juveniles exploiting the variety of resources within the lagoon, compared to the narrower niche of marine post-larvae demonstrates the importance of the trophic role of the lagoon as nursey ground, where aquatic macrophytes (seagrasses and macroalgae) provide the main trophic support as sources of organic matter.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSparus aurata 3acarbon 3acoastal water 3adiet 3aearly development 3afish 3ahabitats 3ajuveniles 3amacroalgae 3anitrogen 3aontogeny 3aorganic matter 3apostlarvae 3aseagrasses 3astable isotopes 3atrophic relationships1 aFranzoi, Piero1 aJackson, Andrew Lloyd1 aMazzola, Antonio1 aVizzini, Salvatrice0 tEstuaries and coasts.g2020 Mar., v. 43, no. 2 p.424-437dSpringer USwJournal:jnl4000572x1559-27237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12237-019-00683-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01723naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245009000162300001800252520069700270592002800967650000800995650002301003650001201026650002601038650001301064700002001077700001401097700002001111700001801131700001901149773013401168856007401302852000901376655001201385IND60639123520221120053046.0190501e20170420xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063912352DNAL7 a10.1039/c7cc01507k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAssaf, Khaleel I.10aHierarchical host–guest assemblies formed on dodecaborate-coated gold nanoparticles  ap. 4616-4619.  aUndecahydro-mercapto-closo-dodecaborate (BSH), a purely inorganic cluster anion, serves as an unconventional stabilizing ligand for the preparation of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs).

TC photolysis proceeded via pseudo-first-order reaction kinetics. The presence of Ca(II) significantly accelerated the degradation rate constants of TC, with the highest value at 0.0314 ± 0.0019 min⁻¹ when the Ca(II) concentration was 5.0 mM. The promoted degradation was attributed to complexation of TC with Ca(II), which increased the light absorption. Absorbance and fluorescence measurements revealed that the strong complexation between TC and Ca(II) likely occurred via the C11 and C12 oxygen groups in the phenolic-diketone moiety of TC in nearly neutral solutions. The formation of HA-Ca(II) complex was found in the binary solute system of HA and Ca(II). Thus, the promotional effect of Ca(II) on photolysis was diminished by HA addition. The largest reduction of 32.5% in rate constants was observed with the highest Ca(II) concentration. Scavenger studies revealed that TC could undergo direct photolysis and self-sensitization by ¹O₂. These results suggest that the coexistence of HA and Ca(II) greatly influences the fate of TC in natural waters, which has important implications for understanding the behavior of antibiotics coexisting with other metal species and ligands.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorbance 3aabsorption 3abehavior 3afluorescence 3ahumic acids 3airradiation 3aligands 3alight emitting diodes 3amoieties 3aoxygen 3aphotolysis 3areaction kinetics 3asolutes 3asolutions 3atetracycline 3aultraviolet radiation 3awater1 aHe, Yiyan1 aKong, Fanguang1 aSun, Weiling1 aHu, Jiangyong0 tWater.g2020 July 22, v. 12, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w120820783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01380naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002500140245006200165300001800227520044500245592002800690650002300718650002300741650003000764650001400794650001300808700002100821700001900842773013400861856007400995852000901069655001201078IND60686738720221122232058.0200318e20200317xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068673872DNAL7 a10.1039/d0cc00786b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFrogley, Benjamin J.10aBi- and poly(carbyne) functionalised polycyclic aromatics  ap. 3265-3268.  aComplexes where a central polyaromatic ring system is substituted with one to four tungsten carbynes have been prepared by Pd⁰/Auᴵ-mediated coupling between a tungsten stannylcarbyne and aryl halides.

In Europe, 15 Odonata species inhabit brackish wetlands and only few detailed data on their tolerance towards salinity are available. We investigated Odonata fauna in 11 sampling stations situated in three estuarine areas (northern Adriatic coastline) which differed in salinity conditions (freshwater- polyhaline habitats) in order to assess affinity of Odonata species to brackish habitats and to describe their distribution pattern in coastal wetlands. Adults, exuviae (the remains of the exoskeleton after the last larval instar), and the main chemical and physical water parameters were sampled every 2 weeks for 1 year in each station. In total, 25 species were detected and 56% of them were able to complete their life cycle in brackish water environments. Our results showed that freshwater and oligohaline ponds were the most favorable for dragonflies, with an overall higher species richness. There was a high species turnover along the salinity gradient, with a strong differentiation among the communities along the gradient. Considering the exuviae, we observed a high specificity with respect to the habitat conditions (seven species exclusive of freshwater sites and six of oligohaline ones, respectively). Among the adults, four species were found exclusively in freshwater habitats and no species seemed to be strictly connected with oligohaline habitats. Coastal wetlands are composed by a mosaic of different habitats especially when freshwater and seawater are close together, supporting many Odonata species with different tolerance toward salinity conditions. They also provide useful insights for conservation and management actions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnisoptera (Odonata) 3aadults 3abrackish water 3acoasts 3aestuaries 3aexoskeleton 3afauna 3afreshwater 3afreshwater ecosystems 3ahabitats 3ainstars 3aintegument 3ainvertebrates 3alarvae 3aponds 3asalinity 3aseawater 3aspecies richness 3awetlands 3aEurope1 aJugovic, Jure1 aTordoni, Enrico1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9722-66921 aPizzul, Elisabetta1 aRiservato, Elisa1 aBacaro, Giovanni0 tEstuaries and coasts.g2020 Mar., v. 43, no. 2 p.375-386dSpringer USwJournal:jnl4000572x1559-27237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12237-019-00687-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02993naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001400149245008200163300001400245520148400259592002801743650002501771650002001796650001001816650001501826650001001841650001201851650001801863650000901881650001201890650001201902650002301914653003001937653002001967653001801987653002402005653001802029653002602047653003002073653003002103653002502133653002802158653001102186653001002197653001902207700001702226700001702243773011102260856008302371852000902454655001202463IND60599034720221117214019.0180702e20140101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059903472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ydbio.2013.10.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaba, Rie10aNANOS2 promotes male germ cell development independent of meiosis suppression  ap. 32-40.  aNANOS2 is an RNA-binding protein essential for fetal male germ cell development. While we have shown that the function of NANOS2 is vital for suppressing meiosis in embryonic XY germ cells, it is still unknown whether NANOS2 plays other roles in the sexual differentiation of male germ cells. In this study, we addressed the issue by generating Nanos2/Stra8 double knockout (dKO) mice, whereby meiosis was prohibited in the double-mutant male germ cells. We found that the expression of male-specific genes, which was decreased in the Nanos2 mutant, was hardly recovered in the dKO embryo, suggesting that NANOS2 plays a role in male gene expression other than suppression of meiosis. To investigate the molecular events that may be controlled by NANOS2, we conducted a series of microarray analyses to search putative targets of NANOS2 that fulfilled 2 criteria: (1) increased expression in the Nanos2 mutant and (2) the mRNA associated with NANOS2. Interestingly, the genes predominantly expressed in undifferentiated primordial germ cells (PGCs) were significantly selected, implying the involvement of NANOS2 in the termination of the characteristics of PGCs. Furthermore, we showed that NANOS2 is required for the maintenance of mitotic quiescence, but not for the initiation of the quiescence in fetal male germ cells. These results suggest that NANOS2 is not merely a suppressor of meiosis, but instead plays pivotal roles in the sexual differentiation of male germ cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA-binding proteins 3agene expression 3agenes 3agerm cells 3amales 3ameiosis 3amessenger RNA 3amice 3amitosis 3amutants 3asexual development 0a5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine 0adouble knockout 0aembryonic day 0aimmunoprecipitation 0aretinoic acid 0areverse transcription 0aphosphate-buffered saline 0apolymerase chain reaction 0aprimordial germ cell 0aRNA immunoprecipitation 0aNanos2 0aStra8 0aMale germ cell1 aKato, Yuzuru1 aSaga, Yumiko0 tDevelopmental biology.g2014 Jan. 01, v. 385, no. 1 p.32-40dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12382x0012-16067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ydbio.2013.10.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03450naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002700164245010600191300001600297520135800313592002801671650002501699650001301724650002501737650002301762650002801785650001201813650001401825650001001839650001501849650001101864650000901875650001201884650001101896650002001907650001301927650001001940650002401950650001201974650002701986650005402013650005902067650003602126650002702162650001102189650002202200650002802222650002002250650003302270650005302303650002002356650003302376650003602409650003602445700001902481700003502500773010702535852000902642856008102651930003302732946001102765655001202776IND4436785820221121023717.0160903e201005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443678582DNAL7 a204222432pmid7 a10.1007/s10142-010-0170-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYousafzai, Faridoon K.10aStructural and functional relationship between the Ph1 locus protein 5B2 in wheat and CDK2 in mammals  ap. 157-166.  aThe Ph1 locus in hexaploid wheat is responsible for restricting chromosome pairing at meiosis to true homologues by suppressing homoeologous pairing. Based on detailed modelling studies and predicted ability to form complexes with cyclin-A and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor such as p27, Triticum aestivum-5B2 (ᵀᵃ 5B2) is suggested to be a wheat analogue of human CDK2 enzyme. A blast analysis of the protein data bank using the amino acid sequence of the protein expressed by the 5B2 copy of the cdk-like cluster of genes at the Ph1 locus (ᵀᵃ 5B2) identified humans CDK2 as a top hit. In this analysis, the canonical cyclin binding motif PSTAIRE of CDK2 is replaced by a novel DARTLRE motif and Thr160 residue, phosphorylation of which is required for positive regulation of CDK2, is replaced by a tyrosine (Tyr174) in ᵀᵃ 5B2. Despite these differences, detailed analyses show that all residues known to be important for cyclin binding are either fully conserved or whenever there is alteration in ᵀᵃ 5B2, a corresponding but comparable alteration is also observed in plant cyclins notably cyclin-A of Arabidopsis thaliana. Moreover, the Thr160/Tyr174 substitution is also accommodated by suitable alterations in the 3D space around Tyr174 and the 3D model of ᵀᵃ 5B2 predicts Tyr174 to play the same role as Thr160 plays in CDK2.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aTriticum 3aamino acid sequences 3achromosome pairing 3acyclin-dependent kinase 3acyclins 3adatabases 3agenes 3ahexaploidy 3ahumans 3aloci 3ameiosis 3amodels 3aphosphorylation 3atyrosine 3awheat 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aCrystallography, X-Ray 2aCyclin-Dependent Kinase 2xchemistryxmetabolism. 2aCyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor Proteinsxmetabolism 2aCyclinsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aGenetic Locixgenetics 2aHumans 2aModels, Molecular 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhosphorylation 2aPhosphothreoninexmetabolism 2aPlant Proteinsxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aProtein Binding 2aProtein Structure, Secondary 2aStructure-Activity Relationship 2aTriticumxenzymologyxgenetics.1 aAl-Kaff, Nadia1 aMoore, Graham,d1958 March 19-0 tFunctional & integrative genomics.g2010 May, v. 10, no. 2 p.157-166dSpringer-Verlagx1438-793X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10142-010-0170-73Available from publisher's site  a20100508b20100605c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02584naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100006200149245014700211300001600358520128600374592002801660650001101688650001201699650001201711650001501723650001601738650001501754650001201769651002101781653003501802653002601837653003201863653002801895653001101923700005601934773011501990856008402105852000902189655001202198IND60633932420221122050512.0191214e20190520xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063393242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agwat.2019.02.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVazifehkhah, Saeed1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3700-931910aHydrological and agricultural droughts assessment in a semi-arid basin: Inspecting the teleconnections of climate indices on a catchment scale  ap. 413-425.  aThe hydrological and agricultural droughts and their characteristics were evaluated using the Standardized Streamflow Index (SSFI) and Standardized Soil Moisture Index (SSI) across the Konya Closed Basin (KCB) in Turkey, respectively. The Modified Mann-Kendall (MMK) trend method was applied to detect trends over the KCB. Furthermore, the teleconnections of various large-scale climate indices (LSCI: NAO, AO, PDO, SCAND, POLEUR and EA/WR) over 3-month SSFI and SSI series were considered through cross wavelet transform (XWT) technique. The analysis indicated an increase in drought duration and severity since 1999. The MMK test revealed significant negative trends for SSFI series at different time scales. A series of MMK test on different SSI series exhibited trendless behavior over the northern parts of the KCB; however, significant negative (positive) trend on southeastern (southwestern) area appeared to be prevailing. Moreover, the results of XWT analysis in association with different LSCI and SSFI/SSI series demonstrated multiple considerable common powers on lower periods (i.e., less than 8 month). The XWT analysis showed significant relationship between the LSCI with drought indices in some periods and the absence of such associations in the remaining period.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3aclimate 3adrought 3asoil water 3astream flow 3awatersheds 3awavelet 3aTurkey (country) 0aNon-parametric drought indices 0aModified Mann-Kendall 0aLarge-scale climate indices 0aCross wavelet transform 0aTurkey1 aKahya, Ercan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9455-66640 tAgricultural water management.g2019 May 20, v. 217 p.413-425dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8460x0378-37747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2019.02.0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02138naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245009100163300001300254520119600267592002801463650000901491650001101500650003301511650001401544650001701558650002501575700002601600773012701626856007401753852000901827655001201836IND60664227720221123014456.0190910e20131205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066422772DNAL7 a10.1039/c3np70063a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorrison, Karen C.10aNatural products as starting points for the synthesis of complex and diverse compounds  ap. 6-14.  aCovering: up to 2013 Natural products and their derivatives are used as treatments for numerous diseases. Many of these compounds are structurally complex, possessing a high percentage of sp³ hybridized carbons and multiple stereogenic centers. Due to the difficulties associated with the isolation of large numbers of novel natural products, lead discovery efforts over the last two decades have shifted toward the screening of less structurally complex synthetic compounds. While there have been many success stories from these campaigns, the modulation of certain biological targets (e.g. protein–protein interactions) and disease areas (e.g. antibacterials) often require complex molecules. Thus, there is considerable interest in the development of strategies to construct large collections of compounds that mimic the complexity of natural products. Several of these strategies focus on the conversion of simple starting materials to value-added products and have been reviewed elsewhere. Herein we review the use of natural products as starting points for the generation of complex compounds, discussing both early ad hoc efforts and a more recent systematization of this approach.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarea 3acarbon 3aprotein-protein interactions 3ascreening 3atherapeutics 3avalue-added products1 aHergenrother, Paul J.0 tNatural product reports.g2013 Dec. 5, v. 31, no. 1 p.6-14dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26900x1460-47527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3np70063a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02117naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245006000160500001400220520091700234592002801151650001201179650001301191650001101204650002501215650001701240650000901257650002201266650000901288650001501297650001501312650001801327650001301345650001101358650001701369650001001386650002001396650001801416651001501434700002101449773011901470856007301589852000901662655001201671IND60707994920221120021959.0200821e20200726xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070799492DNAL7 a10.3390/w120821242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBashar, Toriqul 10aWater Pollution in a Densely Populated Megapolis, Dhaka  aNAL-light  aRapid urbanization has been a boon for industrial growth in Bangladesh, leading the Dhaka megapolis to become one of the least livable places in the world.

Using mainly secondary data, this article explores the water quality of the river Buriganga that flows across Dhaka and identifies major sources of pollutants. While much of the article analyzes the sources and extent of pollution, it also points toward a great threat to public health from the presence of high levels of heavy metals, such as chromium, lead, and iron, as well as chemicals, including ammonia and phosphate. Moreover, the article recommends some policy changes that could potentially reduce pollution levels and boost water sustainability not only in Dhaka but also in other fast-growing cities in the least developed countries (LDCs).  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonia 3achromium 3acities 3adeveloping countries 3aheavy metals 3airon 3aissues and policy 3alead 3aphosphates 3apollutants 3apublic health 3aresearch 3arivers 3aurbanization 3awater 3awater pollution 3awater quality 3aBangladesh1 aFung, Ivan  W.H.0 tWater.g2020 July 26, v. 12, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w120821243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01853naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245008400166300001800250520087500268592002801143650001901171650001701190650002401207650001901231650001601250700001901266700001901285700001601304700001301320773009901333856008601432852000901518655001201527IND60577275920221122231427.0170807e20150728xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057727592DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.5b017562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Yiwen10aHighly Sensitive CO2-Responsive Polymeric Microgels That Respond Within Seconds  ap. 8138-8145.  aIn this work, polymeric microgels with swift response to CO₂ are synthesized by polymerization of tertiary-amine containing methacrylate monomers (N,N-diethylaminoethyl methacrylate, DEAEMA) and polyethylene glycol monomethyl ether acrylate (PEGMA) as stabilizers. The obtained microgels are stable but very sensitive to CO₂, which can rapidly swell and further collapse within 5 s upon bubbling of CO₂, or within minutes in an atmosphere of gaseous CO₂. The protonation of the tertiary amine groups in the presence of CO₂ induces sensitive swelling and further irreversible collapse of the microgels due to the internal charge repulsion and relatively low cross-linking density in the core area of microgels. This rapid response to CO₂ may find further applications in the fields of sensitive detection or responsive loading and release upon CO₂ stimulus.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3acrosslinking 3apolyethylene glycol 3apolymerization 3astabilizers1 aZhao, Tingting1 aWang, Bingshen1 aQiu, Dengli1 aMa, Ning0 tLangmuir.g2015 July 28, v. 31, no. 29 p.8138-8145dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.langmuir.5b017563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02723naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002700152245013700179506011700316506007600433520098800509592002801497506003701525650001301562650001701575650001401592650001901606650001101625650001301636650001601649650001001665653001201675653002301687653002101710653001701731653002201748653001201770700003001782700003601812700002701848700002201875700003401897700003301931700002501964700003201989773010002021856008702121852000902208655001202217IND60779811220221207060327.0220719e20221115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077981122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2022.1334472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSerrano-García, Irene10aProlonged on-tree maturation vs. cold storage of Hass avocado fruit: Changes in metabolites of bioactive interest at edible ripeness  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWhen the recipient of the product is relatively distant from the production area, it is necessary to use cold storage and controlled humidity to transport the avocado fruits. One of the main advantages of local avocado consumption lies on the possibility of prolonging on-tree maturation; this could foreseeably modify the metabolic profile of the fruit that reaches the consumer. In this work, the effect of prolonged on tree maturation (during different time intervals) on the final composition of avocado fruit (at edible ripeness) was evaluated and compared with the impact of the same periods after prolonged cold storage. The quantitative evolution of nine bioactive metabolites (7 phenolic compounds, pantothenic and abscisic acids) over 40 days (10-days intervals) was studied by using a solid–liquid extraction protocol and a LC-MS methodology. The results were discussed both considering the quantitative evolution of each individual compound and the sum of all of them.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aavocados 3acold storage 3aevolution 3afood chemistry 3afruits 3ahumidity 3ametabolites 3atrees 0aAvocado 0aOn-tree maturation 0aRipening process 0aCold storage 0aMetabolic profile 0aLC–MS1 aHurtado-Fernández, Elena1 aGonzalez-Fernandez, José Jorge1 aHormaza, José Ignacio1 aPedreschi, Romina1 aReboredo-Rodríguez, Patricia1 aFigueiredo-González, María1 aOlmo-García, Lucía1 aCarrasco-Pancorbo, Alegría0 tFood chemistry.g2022 Nov. 15, v. 394 p.133447-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2022.1334473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03191naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245014300159300001800302520178900320592002802109650001302137650002202150650002102172650000902193650001202202650002202214650004402236650001502280650001502295650002002310700002202330700002002352700002402372700001602396700002202412700001402434700002502448700002802473700001902501773014202520856007402662852000902736655001202745IND60686739020221123031737.0200318e20200317xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068673902DNAL7 a10.1039/d0ta00121j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBritto, Sylvia10aEvolution of lithium ordering with (de)-lithiation in β-LiVOPO₄: insights through solid-state NMR and first principles DFT calculations  ap. 5546-5557.  aThe lithium-ion battery cathode material β-VOPO₄ is capable of intercalating more than one Li ion per transition metal ion due to the accessibility of both the V⁵⁺/V⁴⁺ and V⁴⁺/V³⁺ redox couples at ∼4.5 V and ∼2.3 V vs. Li, respectively, giving a theoretical capacity greater than ∼300 mA h g⁻¹. The ability to perform full and reversible two Li-ion intercalation in this material, however, has been a matter of debate and the poor crystallinity of the fully lithiated phase has thus far precluded its complete structural characterisation by conventional diffraction-based methods. In this work, ⁷Li and ³¹P NMR spectroscopy, in combination with first principles DFT calculations, indicate that chemical lithiation results in a single phase β-Li₂VOPO₄ exhibiting a complex Li ordering scheme with lithium ions occupying multiple disordered environments. 2D NMR ⁷Li correlation experiments were used to deduce the most likely Li ordering for the β-Li₂VOPO₄ phase from amongst several DFT optimised structures. In contrast, electrochemically lithiated β-Li₂₋ₓVOPO₄ discharged to 1.6 V exhibits, in addition to β-Li₂VOPO₄, a β-Li₁.₅VOPO₄ phase. The existence of β-Li₁.₅VOPO₄ is not reflected in the flat galvanostatic charge and discharge curves nor is evident from diffraction-based methods due to the very close structural similarity between the β-Li₁.₅VOPO₄ phase and β-Li₂VOPO₄ phases. We demonstrate that solid state NMR spectroscopy, in combination with DFT results, provides a powerful tool for identifying intermediate states formed during charge/discharge of these complex phosphates as these phases can be distinguished from the end member phases primarily by the nature of the lithium ordering.  aPublisher supplied data 3acathodes 3acrystal structure 3aelectrochemistry 3aions 3alithium 3alithium batteries 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aphosphates 3aphosphorus 3astable isotopes1 aSeymour, Ieuan D.1 aHalat, David M.1 aHidalgo, Marc F.

Karst.) in Norway, covering wide ranges of site index and initial spacing, this study evaluated stand basal area and volume responses to initial spacing and examined whether these responses varied by stand ages or site quality. We developed nonlinear regression models that described the standing basal area or volume responses to initial spacing along with site index and stand ages. The results show that closer spacings produced higher standing basal area and volume than wider spacings. The response curves are highly nonlinear in younger stands and become nearly linear in mid-rotation stands, indicating stronger responses at younger ages and weaker responses as age increases. Furthermore, for young stands, spacing effects are stronger at closer than at wider spacings. The basal area and volume responses to initial spacing tend to be similar across site indices. However, the interaction of site index and stand age on spacing responses makes it difficult to isolate the effect of site index on spacing responses. Mortality is higher and begins earlier at closer spacings than wider. The mean diameter of the largest 100, 400, 600, and 800 trees ha⁻¹ increased with spacing in three out of the nine experiments. Dominant height did not vary by initial spacing for any of the experiments. The findings suggest that the extra volume production in stands of closer initial spacing is restricted to early stand development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aplantations 3asite index 3aspatial distribution 3aregression analysis 3aPicea abies 3atrees 3astand basal area 3amortality 3aNorway 0aNorway 0ainitial spacing 0avolume 0aNorway spruce 0aBasal area 0abasal area1 aBrunner, Andreas1 aØyen, Bernt-Håvard,0 tScandinavian journal of forest research.g2012 Oct. 1, v. 27, no. 7 p.637-648dTaylor & Francis Groupx1651-18917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02827581.2012.693191  aDNAL 7aarticle03633naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100003300164245014800197300001600345520206100361592002802422650001702450650001102467650001002478650001102488650001302499650001202512650001202524650001202536650001402548650001302562650001202575650001702587650001402604650001902618650000902637650001202646650001202658650003502670650001402705650003502719650002002754651001302774651001302787700002102800700001902821700002102840700002002861700001802881773011102899856004803010852000903058655001203067IND4486929220221123042606.0121003e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448692922DNAL7 a205267522pmid7 a10.1007/s12011-010-8731-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aK̲h̲ān̲, Ẓafar Iqbāl,10aStudies on the Transfer of Copper from Soil to Pastures at Different Sampling Periods: A Case Study of a Semiarid Region (Sargodha) in Pakistan  ap. 126-130.  aThe present investigation was carried out to assess the transfer of copper element from the soil to forage plants consumed by the ruminants in two different pastures at the Livestock Experimental Station at Sargodha, Punjab, Pakistan. Soil and forage samples were collected periodically from two different pastures and analyzed after wet digestion. The survey of copper flow from forage from both pastures in the grazing period exhibited a consistent pattern of decrease from sampling periods 1 to 4 across all the sampling periods. In the legumes and grass pastures, it was decreased regularly and reduced up to 50% to that at the beginning across all the samplings. The copper concentration was higher in the legume pasture than that of grass pasture and sufficient to fulfill the requirement of grazing animals, while in grass pasture, it was higher at the first two sampling periods but dropped to a marginal deficient level at sampling period 3 and reached at the severe deficient level at the fourth sampling period during this investigation. The soil–plant transfer factor for Cu was higher in legume pasture compared to its counterpart. It was found that with the increase of forage maturity, a significant reduction in the forage Cu concentration was observed reaching its minimum level at the last sampling period in the grass pasture. These concentrations were within the marginal and severe deficient levels and provide for only 76% of the ruminant requirements. The naturally upset balance of Cu offers a potential hazard not only to both pastures, but also to the Cu status of grazing ruminants therein. This necessitates the provision of additional amount of Cu mixture in the nutrition of livestock for health and reproduction potential enhancement of the animals being reared at that farm. Supplementing the deficient mineral with locally available Cu feed sources like green fodders, cakes, and brans or providing region-specific mineral supplements would alleviate the deficiency of copper during the late season at the livestock farm.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3acopper 3afarms 3aforage 3aforaging 3agrasses 3agrazing 3alegumes 3alivestock 3apastures 3arearing 3areproduction 3aruminants 3asemiarid zones 3asoil 3asurveys 2aClimate 2aCopperxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aEcosystem 2aPlantsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aSoilxchemistry 3aPakistan 0aPakistan1 aAshraf, Muhammad1 aAl-Qurainy, F.1 aKafīl, Aḥmad,1 aGondal, Sumaira1 aFardous, Asia0 tBiological trace element research.g2011 June, v. 141, no. 1-3 p.126-130dSpringer-Verlagx0163-49847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12011-010-8731-0  aDNAL 7aarticle02750naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245012800154300001800282520145800300592002801758650002401786650002201810650001401832650001801846650001601864650001901880650001901899650001101918650001601929650001701945650001601962700001601978700001601994700001602010700001702026700001602043700001602059700001602075773014202091856007402233852000902307655001202316IND60686739120221123031819.0200318e20200317xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068673912DNAL7 a10.1039/d0ta00123f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Zhiqi10aIncorporating self-assembled silane-crosslinked carbon dots into perovskite solar cells to improve efficiency and stability  ap. 5629-5637.  aCarbon dots (CDs) have significant potential in the chemical decoration, crystal modification, and surface passivation of perovskite photovoltaics. However, incompatibility between the hydrophilic/hygroscopic nature of CDs and moisture sensitive perovskite remains an issue. Solving this problem would yield a significant improvement for stable perovskite devices embedded with CDs. Herein, hydrophobic passivation layers are realized for perovskite solar cells (PSCs) through the surface engineering of CDs, exploiting electrostatic self-assembly of trichloro(3,3,3-trifluoropropyl)silane (C₃H₄Cl₃F₃Si) and CDs. The embedded CDs modify perovskite grains and passivate grain boundary defects, thereby promoting the carrier lifetime and charge collection. The inserted C₃H₄Cl₃F₃Si insulating layer provides a tunneling junction at the contact of the perovskite and electron transport layer. This tunneling layer can selectively conduct electrons and block holes, which spatially separate photo-generated carriers to suppress their recombination. As a result, the optimized perovskite devices deliver the highest efficiency of 21.12% with a high fill factor of 82.86%. Moreover, the variation of surface wettability can be achieved by the self-assembly of C₃H₄Cl₃F₃Si, which improves the stability of perovskite devices by maintaining nearly 90% efficiency for over 30 days' exposure to an ambient atmosphere without encapsulation.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon quantum dots 3aelectron transfer 3aelectrons 3aencapsulation 3aengineering 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3asilane 3asolar cells 3asolar energy 3awettability1 aGuo, Jiaxin1 aLi, Zhuowei1 aHan, Wenbin1 aRen, Guanhua1 aLiu, Chunyu1 aShen, Liang1 aGuo, Wenbin0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2020 Mar. 17, v. 8, no. 11 p.5629-5637dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ta00123f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03458naa a2200817 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245008500173300001600258520121800274592002801492650002501520650002201545650002501567650001901592650001101611650002401622650002301646650004401669650001301713650001401726650001301740650001101753650002001764650003701784650001801821650001501839653001401854653001901868653003101887653002301918653002301941653001701964653000901981653000801990653001001998653000802008653000802016653000802024653001002032653000702042653000802049653000802057653000802065653000902073653000902082653001002091653001202101653000802113653001002121700002402131700002902155700002102184700003002205700002602235700002402261700005802285700002202343700002602365700002402391700002302415700002302438773007302461856008502534852000902619655001202628IND60563745620221120231417.0170713e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056374562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.toxicon.2017.02.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDrane, Stephen B.10aStructure and activity of contryphan-Vc2: Importance of the d-amino acid residue  ap. 113-122.  aIn natural proteins and peptides, amino acids exist almost invariably as l-isomers. There are, however, several examples of naturally-occurring peptides containing d-amino acids. In this study we investigated the role of a naturally-occurring d-amino acid in a small peptide identified in the transcriptome of a marine cone snail. This peptide belongs to a family of peptides known as contryphans, all of which contain a single d-amino acid residue. The solution structure of this peptide was solved by NMR, but further investigations with molecular dynamics simulations suggest that its solution behaviour may be more dynamic than suggested by the NMR ensemble. Functional tests in mice uncovered a novel bioactivity, a depressive phenotype that contrasts with the hyperactive phenotypes typically induced by contryphans. Trp3 is important for bioactivity, but this role is independent of the chirality at this position. The d-chirality of Trp3 in this peptide was found to be protective against enzymatic degradation. Analysis by NMR and molecular dynamics simulations indicated an interaction of Trp3 with lipid membranes, suggesting the possibility of a membrane-mediated mechanism of action for this peptide.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acid sequences 3aaquatic organisms 3abioactive properties 3alipid bilayers 3alipids 3amechanism of action 3amolecular dynamics 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apeptides 3aphenotype 3aproteins 3asnails 3astereoisomerism 3astructure-activity relationships 3atranscriptome 3atryptophan 0aConotoxin 0aContryphan-Vc2 0aNuclear magnetic resonance 0aSolution structure 0aMolecular dynamics 0ad-amino acid 0aBMRB 0aBSA 0aDIPEA 0aDMF 0aDPC 0aHyp 0aLC-MS 0aMD 0aNMR 0aNOE 0aPDB 0aPOPC 0aPOPG 0aROESY 0aRP-HPLC 0aTFA 0aTOCSY1 aRobinson, Samuel D.1 aMacRaild, Christopher A.1 aChhabra, Sandeep1 aChittoor, Balasubramanyam1 aMorales, Rodrigo A.V.1 aLeung, Eleanor W.W.1 aBelgi, Alessia1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8886-82711 aEspino, Samuel S.1 aOlivera, Baldomero M.1 aRobinson, Andrea J.1 aChalmers, David K.1 aNorton, Raymond S.0 tToxicon.g2017 Apr., v. 129 p.113-122dElsevier Ltdx0041-01017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.toxicon.2017.02.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03414naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006600151245019800217300001800415520174400433592002802177650004402205650003702249650001502286650001502301650002402316650001402340650001202354650001702366650001402383650002002397650001402417650001202431650001102443650002302454650002102477650001502498653002902513653001402542653001302556653001502569653002002584700002202604700005702626773014302683856008502826852000902911655001202920IND60635591420221119230256.0190402e20190304xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063559142DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.8b064892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrabhu, Subbaiah Muthu1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1553-313610aMono-, Di-, and Tricarboxylic Acid Facilitated Lanthanum-Based Organic Frameworks: Insights into the Structural Stability and Mechanistic Approach for Superior Adsorption of Arsenate from Water  ap. 6917-6928.  aIn this study, we tried to synthesize lanthanum organic frameworks (MOFs) with the linkers of benzoic acid (BA), 1,4-benzene dicarboxylic acid, and 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid (BTC), abbreviated as La-BA, La-BDC, and La-BTC, respectively. Interestingly, the BA linker approached La metal to form lanthanum methanoate (La(HCOO)₃) instead of the La-BA MOF through an acid catalyst amide-hydrolysis mechanism, whereas La-BDC and La-BTC act as MOFs, confirmed by PXRD patterns. Various sophisticated instrumentation techniques such as FTIR, PXRD, XPS, BET, and TGA were utilized to understand the formation of MOF. This is the first report to investigate AsO₄³– adsorption and the dissolution behavior of La-BA, La-BDC, and La-BTC in detail using different spectroscopic methods. The maximum AsO₄³– adsorption densities obtained from the Langmuir isotherm model were found to be 2.623, 3.891, and 0.280 mmol/g for La-BA, La-BDC, and La-BTC, respectively, where the dose ratio was 1 g/L with the speed of 100 rpm at room temperature. The value for La-BDC was significantly superior to the previously reported adsorbents for AsO₄³– to date. The presence of AsO₄³– on both La-BA and La-BDC was confirmed by FTIR and XPS As 3d. After adsorption of 2.4 mM AsO₄³–, the precipitation mechanism controls the adsorption capacities on La-BA and the ligand exchange mechanism on La-BDC confirmed by solution as well as solid analyses. Sorption kinetic data of AsO₄³– followed a pseudo-second-order model, which is consistent with chemisorption involving the possible coordination of AsO₄³– on La-BA and La-BDC. These results suggested that the MOF materials can be developed to immobilize arsenic-rich wastewater.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aambient temperature 3aarsenates 3aarsenic 3abenzoic acid 3acatalysts 3ainstrumentation 3alanthanum 3aligands 3amodels 3asorption isotherms 3athermogravimetry 3awastewater 0aMetal organic frameworks 0aLanthanum 0aArsenate 0aAdsorption 0aLigand exchange1 aImamura, Shunsuke1 aSasaki, Keiko1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2882-07000 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2019 Mar. 04, v. 7, no. 7 p.6917-6928dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.8b064893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02585naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245013300169300001600302520109100318592002801409650002901437650002101466650002301487650002001510650002401530650003701554650001401591650001801605650002801623650002801651650002401679650003601703653001601739653002401755653001601779653000801795653000901803653001101812700001701823700002001840700001801860700005801878773007301936856008502009852000902094655001202103IND60563745820221120231447.0170713e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056374582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.toxicon.2017.02.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKwon, Ii-Seul10aPneumolysin induces cellular senescence by increasing ROS production and activation of MAPK/NF-κB signal pathway in glial cells  ap. 100-112.  aSenescence is an irreversible proliferation arrest that is induced by various stress stimuli including genotoxin. Pneumolysin (PLY) is a pathogenicity factor unique to Streptococcus pneumoniae that is important in pneumococcal-induced diseases such as otitis media, meningitis and pneumonia. However, the cell fate response to the toxin is mechanistically unclear. We investigated the effect of PLY on cellular senescence in BV-2 microglial cells. Exposure to PLY resulted in changes in the expression of phospho-p53, p21, p16, pRb and CDK2 and increased the number of senescence associated β-gal positive cells. PLY-treatment also increased PAI-1 expression and cell proliferation arrest in concentration- and time-dependent manners. PLY induced NF-κB activation and phosphorylation of SIRT-1, ERK1/2, JNK, and p38 MAPK. In addition, PLY increased the production of reactive oxygen species. Overall, the results suggest that PLY regulates microglial cellular senescence by enhancing production of reactive oxygen species, activation of MAPK and NF-κB, and phosphorylation of SIRT-1.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStreptococcus pneumoniae 3abacterial toxins 3acell proliferation 3acell senescence 3amechanism of action 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3aneuroglia 3apathogenicity 3aprotein phosphorylation 3areactive oxygen species 3asignal transduction 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 0aPneumolysin 0aCellular senescence 0aGlial cells 0aROS 0aMAPK 0aNF-κB1 aKim, Jinwook1 aRhee, Dong-Kwon1 aKim, Byung-Oh1 aPyo, Suhkneung1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8333-62680 tToxicon.g2017 Apr., v. 129 p.100-112dElsevier Ltdx0041-01017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.toxicon.2017.02.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03032naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245014000165300001800305520156200323592002801885650000801913650002901921650002401950650001701974650001201991650001702003650001402020650001002034650002102044650001202065650002102077650001802098650001302116650002802129650001702157650002102174700001402195700001702209700005302226700001402279700005602293773012202349856008202471852000902553655001202562IND60643893520221120183946.0190514e20190328xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064389352DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.biomac.9b000542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yuxin10aReactive Oxygen Species (ROS)-Degradable Polymeric Nanoplatform for Hypoxia-Targeted Gene Delivery: Unpacking DNA and Reducing Toxicity  ap. 1899-1913.  aSmart polymers as ideal gene carriers have drawn increasing attentions due to the effective DNA release once triggered by intrinsic stimuli, as well as reduced cytotoxicity. Herein, a stimulus-responsive, positively charged and water-soluble polymer (OEI-TKₓ) was facilely engineered by cross-linking low molecular weight oligoethylenimine (OEI) via thioketal (TK) linkages that would cleave selectively in reactive oxygen species (ROS)-rich environments induced by hypoxia. Agarose gel electrophoresis assay demonstrated that the threshold N/P ratios for complete retardation of negatively charged DNA migration were above 5 for OEI-TKₓ. The reduction in DNA-condensing capability and the changes in particle size, size distribution and particle morphology all illustrated that OEI-TKₓ possessed excellent ROS responsiveness. OEI-TKₓ/DNA polyplexes showed lower toxicity and higher gene transfection efficiency compared with PEI/DNA polyplexes. The optimum formulation, OEI-TKₓ/DNA polyplexes (N/P = 40), showed a little better performance than PEI/DNA polyplexes in cellular uptake profile. Furthermore, OEI-TKₓ/DNA polyplexes could escape from endosomes to the cytosol as efficiently as PEI/DNA polyplexes. Confocal images confirmed that OEI-TKₓ/DNA polyplexes could more effectively release DNA than PEI/DNA polyplexes, mainly owing to the valid cleavage of thioketal linkages induced by characteristic rich-ROS in Hela cells. These results suggested that OEI-TKₓ could represent an on-demand stimulus-responsive gene delivery platform.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aagar gel electrophoresis 3aconfocal microscopy 3acrosslinking 3acytosol 3acytotoxicity 3aendosomes 3agenes 3ahuman cell lines 3ahypoxia 3amolecular weight 3aparticle size 3apolymers 3areactive oxygen species 3atransfection 3awater solubility1 aZhou, Jie1 aMa, Shengnan1 aHe, Yiyan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1568-60471 aYang, Jun1 aGu, Zhongwei1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1547-68800 tBiomacromolecules.g2019 Mar. 28, v. 20, no. 5 p.1899-1913dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12556x1526-46027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biomac.9b000543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02002naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245011100167300001600278520075700294592002801051650001001079650002401089650002201113650001501135650002001150650002901170650002101199650001801220653001701238653002501255653001701280653001701297653002201314700002201336700002501358700002601383773012301409856005101532852000901583655001201592IND50086862720221119223607.0140412e20121201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008686272DNAL7 a10.1080/02827581.2012.6866272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFunda, Tomas10aOptimization of genetic gain and diversity in seed orchard crops considering variation in seed germination  ap. 787-793.  aBalancing genetic gain and diversity in seed orchard crops is of a major regeneration importance. Here we extend our earlier work on the development of an optimization protocol that maximizes crops' genetic gain at any predefined diversity level, considering parental reproductive output, co-ancestry, and inbreeding, by incorporating variation in seed germination as an input. Variation in seed germination capacity substantially affected seedlots' genetic diversity by either under- or overestimating their effective population size; however, genetic gains were robust and their differences were negligible. The contrasting results of gain and diversity support the inclusion of the germination capacity, when available, in the optimization protocol.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrops 3agenetic improvement 3agenetic variation 3ainbreeding 3apopulation size 3areproductive performance 3aseed germination 3aseed orchards 0aSeed orchard 0agermination capacity 0aoptimization 0agenetic gain 0agenetic diversity1 aLstibůrek, Milan1 aKlápště, Jaroslav1 aEl-Kassaby, Yousry A.0 tScandinavian journal of forest research.g2012 Dec. 1, v. 27, no. 8 p.787-793dTaylor & Francis Groupx1651-18917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02827581.2012.686627  aDNAL 7aarticle03006naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245009200156520187900248592002802127650001102155650001202166650002102178650002502199650001902224650001102243650001602254650001502270651001802285700001402303700001902317700002402336700001402360700002302374700002102397773011902418856007402537852000902611655001202620IND60768558920221122173000.0220225e20220217xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076855892DNAL7 a10.3390/w140406222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Jihua 10aMoisture Transport versus Precipitation Change in Sub-Basins of the Yangtze River Basin  aThe Yangtze River Basin (YRB) exhibits great climate heterogeneity, from high-elevated source areas dominated by westerlies to downstream wetlands sensitive to monsoon flows. However, the atmospheric hydrological cycle and associated precipitation changes are rarely being synthetically studied in different sub-basins of the YRB, which are particularly important since floods in the main stream largely result from the superposition of precipitation-runoff peaks from different sub-basins. By dividing the entire YRB into 12 sub-basins, this study presents a preliminary analysis of precipitation features and the associated moisture transport characteristics at the sub-basin scale during 1961–2015. Results suggest that the peak month of precipitation in the northwest sub-basins (July) is one month later than that in the southeast sub-basins (June). The highest total column water vapor (TCWV) contributes to the peak precipitation in July in the northwest sub-basins, while the peak precipitation in June in the southeast sub-basins is more relative to the interaction among multi-circulations (featured by relatively high westerly moisture transport and relatively low south monsoon contribution in the progression process of monsoon precipitation belt). The south monsoon moisture during summer seldom reaches the source region basin (SRB), the Jinshajiang River Basin (JRB), and the Mintuojiang River Basin (MTB). During 1961–2015, the precipitation mainly exhibits an “increase–decrease–increase” pattern from the source region to downstream; however, it is unlikely that this pattern is forced by the TCWV and zonal/meridional moisture transport. In addition, the moisture transport anomalies between wet and dry years are also defined in the 12 sub-basins, and these anomalies are characterized by significantly different moisture transport patterns.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3aclimate 3ahydrologic cycle 3amoisture diffusivity 3amonsoon season 3asummer 3awater vapor 3awatersheds 3aYangtze River1 aLi, Ying 1 aWang, Yingfei 1 aZhou, Shuangshuang 1 aYuan, Xi 1 aKjellgren, Björn,1 aHuang, Yingping 0 tWater.g2022 Feb. 17, v. 14, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w140406223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02185naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001700144245008100161300001800242500002000260520095700280592002801237650001301265650002801278650001501306650001401321650002701335650001501362650001701377650002601394650001301420650002901433650001201462700002201474700002101496700001601517700002001533773013501553856007801688852000901766655001201775IND60589102320221117111500.0180202e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058910232DNAL7 a10.1002/jssc.2013003922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKubo, Takuya10aRapid separations by LC using ion‐exchange media based on spongy monoliths  ap. 2813-2818.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aNovel sponge‐based monoliths containing ionic functional groups were developed for rapid separation and/or concentration of ionic solutes. The cationic and anionic spongy monoliths were prepared by chemical modifications of the pore surface on an original spongy monolith consisting of poly(ethylene‐co‐vinyl acetate). After hydrolysis of the spongy monolith, an anionic or a cationic moiety was introduced with succinyl chloride or acryloyl chloride/diethylamine, respectively. As a result of liquid chromatographic evaluations for the columns packed with these ionic spongy monoliths, both anionic and cationic monoliths showed ionic interactions with the opposing ionic solutes even if a higher flow rate (9.0 mL/min) was employed. Furthermore, we demonstrated the effective and rapid preconcentration of adenosine 5′‐monophosphate in water using column‐switching LC combined with the cationic spongy monolith as an online SPE adsorbent.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetates 3aadenosine monophosphate 3aadsorbents 3achlorides 3aethylene-vinyl acetate 3ahydrolysis 3aion exchange 3aliquid chromatography 3amoieties 3aorganochlorine compounds 3asolutes1 aTanigawa, Tetsuya1 aTominaga, Yuichi1 aHosoya, Ken1 aŌtsuka, Kōji,0 tJournal of separation science.g2013 Sept., v. 36, no. 17 p.2813-2818dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3924049x1615-93067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jssc.2013003923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03142naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002500149245008400174300001400258520165100272592002801923650001501951650002001966650001101986650001301997650002402010650001802034650001402052650001902066650003002085650001902115650001802134650001202152650001002164650001202174650002102186650001602207650003202223653002102255653002002276653002902296700001702325700002002342700002102362700001802383700002002401773011102421856008302532852000902615655001202624IND60599035120221117213515.0180702e20140101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059903512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ydbio.2013.10.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJaspers, Martin H.J.14aThe fatty acyl-CoA reductase Waterproof mediates airway clearance in Drosophila  ap. 23-31.  aThe transition from a liquid to a gas filled tubular network is the prerequisite for normal function of vertebrate lungs and invertebrate tracheal systems. However, the mechanisms underlying the process of gas filling remain obscure. Here we show that waterproof, encoding a fatty acyl-CoA reductase (FAR), is essential for the gas filling of the tracheal tubes during Drosophila embryogenesis, and does not affect branch network formation or key tracheal maturation processes. However, electron microscopic analysis reveals that in waterproof mutant embryos the formation of the outermost tracheal cuticle sublayer, the envelope, is disrupted and the hydrophobic tracheal coating is damaged. Genetic and gain-of-function experiments indicate a non-cell-autonomous waterproof function for the beginning of the tracheal gas filling process. Interestingly, Waterproof reduces very long chain fatty acids of 24 and 26 carbon atoms to fatty alcohols. Thus, we propose that Waterproof plays a key role in tracheal gas filling by providing very long chain fatty alcohols that serve as potential substrates for wax ester synthesis or related hydrophobic substances that ultimately coat the inner lining of the trachea. The hydrophobicity in turn reduces the tensile strength of the liquid inside the trachea, leading to the formation of a gas bubble, the focal point for subsequent gas filling. Waterproof represents the first enzyme described to date that is necessary for tracheal gas filling without affecting branch morphology. Considering its conservation throughout evolution, Waterproof orthologues may play a similar role in the vertebrate lung.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDrosophila 3aacyl coenzyme A 3acarbon 3acoatings 3aelectron microscopy 3aembryogenesis 3aevolution 3afatty alcohols 3again-of-function mutation 3ahydrophobicity 3ainvertebrates 3aliquids 3alungs 3amutants 3atensile strength 3avertebrates 3avery long chain fatty acids 0aAirway clearance 0aTracheal system 0aFatty acyl-CoA reductase1 aPflanz, Ralf1 aRiedel, Dietmar1 aKawelke, Steffen1 aFeussner, Ivo1 aSchuh, Reinhard0 tDevelopmental biology.g2014 Jan. 01, v. 385, no. 1 p.23-31dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12382x0012-16067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ydbio.2013.10.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02464naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245010400172300001600276520124900292592002801541650001701569650001801586650001501604650001001619650001001629650002601639650001001665650001401675650001401689650003001703650001401733651002201747700002201769700002801791700001701819700001701836700002401853700001901877773007401896856005101970852000902021655001202030IND50087013320221118005316.0140412e20130501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008701332DNAL7 a10.1080/00063657.2012.7448072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRojo, M.

Parasites were detected from blood samples by polymerase chain reaction screening.Results About half (51.3%) of 152 dippers showed some kind of infection. The genus Haemoproteus was recorded in 49.3% of the birds, and the genus Leucocytozoon in 19.1%, while Plasmodium was present only in 0.7%. Among the infected birds, 34.6% carried a double infection (Haemoproteus + Leucocytozoon). Prevalence did not differ between gender or age-classes, but it varied between study sites, being significantly higher in mountains with higher precipitation. There was a reduction in body mass owing to double infection in yearling males only.Conclusion This is the first work assessing parasite prevalence in dippers from southern Europe. Infection of dippers by haemosporidians is likely to be related to a study site's climatic envelope.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHaemoproteus 3aLeucocytozoon 3aPlasmodium 3abirds 3ablood 3aenvironmental factors 3amales 3amountains 3aparasites 3apolymerase chain reaction 3ayearlings 3aIberian Peninsula1 aCampos, Francisco1 aHernández, M.

Nitrate (NO ₃⁻-N) concentrations in soil solution reflect the impacts of farm management on N cycling. Some of the most remote regions in the world are undergoing rapid land-use change, yet there are major barriers to conducting research in these locations. Fortunately, new tools such as ion-selective electrodes (ISEs) provide low-cost and simple methods for conducting chemical analysis in the field. Researchers compared soil solution NO ₃⁻-N concentrations measured using an ISE with concentrations measured on a colorimeter (cadmium reduction) and found good agreement (r ² = 0.96, P < 0.0001) between the two methods. The ISE is also 66 times less expensive than in-country laboratory analysis or shipping and analyzing the samples in the United States. Thus, the ISE is an excellent tool for rapid analysis of N in soil solution, providing critical information on N dynamics in remote regions.  aPublisher supplied data 3acadmium 3achemical analysis 3acolorimetry 3afarm management 3afertilizers 3aland use change 3aleaching 3anitrates 3anitrogen 3arapid methods 3aresearchers 3arunoff 3ashipping 3asoil solution 3aspecific ion electrodes 3aUnited States 0aField methods 0aion-selective electrode 0aleaching 0anitrate1 aWeil, Ray0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g2014 Aug. 6, v. 45, no. 14 p.1974-1980dTaylor & Francisx1532-24167nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00103624.2014.9122973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02636naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245014600166300001600312520158200328592002801910650002401938650002201962650001301984650001701997650001002014650001502024650002702039650001002066651002002076700001802096700001802114773009702132856004802229852000902277655001202286IND4478630220221119180852.0120727e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447863022DNAL7 a10.1007/s11295-011-0428-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShepherd, Mervyn10aRevisiting genetic structuring in spotted gums (genus Corymbia section Maculatae) focusing on C. maculata, an early diverged, insular lineage  ap. 137-147.  aSpecies delineation in the spotted gum complex was revisited focusing on Corymbia maculata. This study expands the range of C. maculata analysed with microsatellite markers to include populations from the north of the species range. It supported earlier findings that it is a cohesive genetic entity, well resolved from northern spotted gum taxa, Corymbia citriodora and Corymbia henryi; and inferences that its insularity is due to early lineage divergence and historical isolation. The northern extent of C. maculata sampled, as defined by chloroplast and nuclear genomes predominantly of C. maculata character, was the location of Kiwarrak, south of the Manning River near Taree in New South Wales. Trees from a recognised intergrade zone at the Yarratt locality, around 26 km north of Kiwarrak, also possessed a uniquely C. maculata chloroplast haplotype, but their nuclear genomes were predominantly of northern taxa ancestry. Range expansion of northern taxa leading to southerly gene movement into populations formerly C. maculata, would account for this apparent instance of chloroplast capture. Two subpopulations were identified in C. maculata, a northern population of which the Ourimbah locality was the most southerly studied, and a southern population of which Wingello was the most northerly locality studied. Diminished levels of northern taxa ancestry, i.e. C. citriodora or C. henryi, in individuals from the southern, relative to the northern subpopulation of C. maculata, suggested that secondary contact with northern taxa contributes to its substructure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCorymbia citriodora 3aCorymbia maculata 3aancestry 3achloroplasts 3agenes 3ahaplotypes 3amicrosatellite repeats 3atrees 3aNew South Wales1 aHenson, Mike,1 aLee, David J.0 tTree genetics & genomes.g2012 Feb., v. 8, no. 1 p.137-147dSpringer-Verlagx1614-29427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11295-011-0428-9  aDNAL 7aarticle03369naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002800151245020100179300001800380520161600398592002802014650003702042650001402079650002102093650001302114650001302127650001402140650001602154650000802170650001602178650001302194650002102207650003702228653003402265653002402299653002002323653002002343653002002363700002402383700001602407700001602423700001802439700002302457700005802480700001902538700005702557773014302614856008502757852000902842655001202851IND60635591820221119230212.0190402e20190305xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063559182DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.8b065442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPark, J.

The effects of the controlled TiO₂ underlayer thickness and high temperature quenching process on the interfacial diffusion of Ti⁴⁺/Sn⁴⁺ and TiO₂ passivation of hematite nanorod arrays have been carefully studied. The improved photoelectrochemical water oxidation performance of the TiO₂ underlayered hematite nanorod photoanodes after high-temperature quenching (800 °C for 10 min) suggests enhanced interfacial Ti⁴⁺ diffusion, blocking of electron back transfer, and reduced interfacial charge recombination. The TiO₂ underlayers led to more inclined growth of hematite (α-Fe₂O₃) nanorods on the fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrates. Ti⁴⁺ and Sn⁴⁺ diffusion and formation of the TiO₂ passivation layer on the α-Fe₂O₃ surface are confirmed by HRTEM and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses. As a result, the TU2 photoanode displayed higher donor density and enhanced photocurrent density of (1.45 mA·cm–²) than the pristine hematite photoelectrode (1.0 mA·cm–²). The improved photoelectrochemical performance of TU2 is attributed to the high separation efficiency of photoinduced carriers via TiO₂ underlayer, the Ti⁴⁺/Sn⁴⁺ diffusion, and surface passivation of hematite at high-temperature annealing. The thickness of the TiO₂ underlayer has great influence on the surface passivation as well as resistance on FTO/hematite interfaces than the diffused Sn.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aannealing 3aelectric current 3ahematite 3ananorods 3aoxidation 3atemperature 3atin 3atin dioxide 3atitanium 3atitanium dioxide 3atransmission electron microscopy 0aHematite; Ti4+/Sn4+ diffusion 0aSurface passivation 0aTiO2 underlayer 0aFTO deformation 0aOnset potential1 aMahadik, Mahadeo A.1 aMa, Haiqing1 aAn, Gil Woo1 aLee, Hyun Hwi1 aChʻoe, Sŏn-hŭi,1 aChae, Weon-Sik1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1844-40401 aChung, Hee-Suk1 aJang, Jum Suk1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6874-82160 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2019 Mar. 05, v. 7, no. 7 p.6947-6958dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.8b065443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02844naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245012300175300001600298520110800314592002801422650002001450650001701470650002301487650001701510650001801527650001901545650002001564650001601584650001601600650000901616650001501625650001101640650001301651653003101664653001501695653003201710653003101742653002901773653003401802653003001836653002801866653002501894653002301919653002001942700002301962700002401985700001502009700002202024773015002046856008502196852000902281655001202290IND60123321420221118165144.0180608e20120901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012332142DNAL7 a10.1080/01621459.2012.6559952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aManolopoulou, Ioanna10aBayesian Spatio-Dynamic Modeling in Cell Motility Studies: Learning Nonlinear Taxic Fields Guiding the Immune Response  ap. 855-865.  aWe develop and analyze models of the spatio-temporal organization of lymphocytes in the lymph nodes and spleen. The spatial dynamics of these immune system white blood cells are influenced by biochemical fields and represent key components of the overall immune response to vaccines and infections. A primary goal is to learn about the structure of these fields that fundamentally shape the immune response. We define dynamic models of single-cell motion involving nonparametric representations of scalar potential fields underlying the directional biochemical fields that guide cellular motion. Bayesian hierarchical extensions define multicellular models for aggregating models and data on colonies of cells. Analysis via customized Markov chain Monte Carlo methods leads to Bayesian inference on cell-specific and population parameters together with the underlying spatial fields. Our case study explores data from multiphoton intravital microscopy in lymph nodes of mice, and we use a number of visualization tools to summarize and compare posterior inferences on the three-dimensional taxic fields.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aMarkov chain 3aMonte Carlo method 3acase studies 3acell movement 3adynamic models 3aimmune response 3alymph nodes 3alymphocytes 3amice 3amicroscopy 3aspleen 3avaccines 0aBayesian kernel regression 0aChemotaxis 0aHierarchical dynamic models 0aImmune response monitoring 0aMarkov chain Monte Carlo 0aNonlinear stochastic dynamics 0aPotential field gradients 0aRadial basis regression 0aSingle-cell tracking 0aState-space models 0aTaxic responses1 aMatheu, Melanie P.1 aCahalan, Michael D.1 aWest, Mike1 aKepler, Thomas B.0 tJournal of the American Statistical Association.g2012 Sept. 1, v. 107, no. 499 p.855-865dTaylor & Francis GroupwJournal:19699x1537-274X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01621459.2012.6559953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01872naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245009900170300001600269520066600285592002800951650002000979650001700999650001101016650002501027650001701052650001101069650001001080653002101090653002501111653001601136700002601152700002301178700001901201700002801220773014301248856008601391852000901477655001201486IND60790756220221117021630.0220826e20220903xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079075622DNAL7 a10.1080/19320248.2021.19711362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThayer, Erin K10aYouth Perceptions of the Food Environment in One Seattle, WA Neighborhood: A Qualitative Study  ap. 689-705.  aThis qualitative study aimed to understand youths’ perceptions of the food environment in one “healthy food priority area” in Seattle, WA.

Petr. (syn. Sphaeropsis hypodermia, S. ulmicola). The canker occurred on an approximately 17‐year‐old Ulmus glabra sapling in a mixed conifer/deciduous stand with elm trees severely damaged by Dutch elm disease. This paper describes disease symptoms and provides information on the macro‐ and micromorphology of the fungus isolated from the cankered tissues. The results of BLAST search using DNA sequences obtained for our cultures and subsequent phylogenetic positioning of the fungus among closely related Botryosphaeriaceae indicate that the species is much more closely related to Phaeobotryon than to the other Botryodiplodia or Sphaeropsis species. Moreover, a total of 16 polymorphisms within the ITS region were detected between S. ulmicola associated with Botryodiplodia canker in North America and B. hypodermia associated with the canker observed in Poland. Thus, the “European” variant of “Sphaeropsis” ulmicola can now be easily identified with our barcode sequences. The Botryodiplodia canker is much less prevalent in Europe than in North America. Differences in virulence of “American” and “European” linages and differences in susceptibility of various elm species may be the reason for the higher prevalence of the disease in North America.  aPublisher supplied data  cMinistry of Science and Higher Education of The Republic of Poland  cstatutory research mechanism  cFaculty of Forestry  aDS 3414cUniversity of Agriculture in Cracow under the research 3aBotryodiplodia 3aBotryosphaeriaceae 3aDNA 3aDNA barcoding 3aDutch elm disease 3aSphaeropsis 3aUlmus glabra 3aUlmus hollandica 3aconifers 3afungi 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3amicrostructure 3aphylogeny 3avirulence 3aCarpathian region 3aNorth America 3aPoland1 aBoroń, Piotr,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8581-67591 aMichalcewicz, Jakub1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6489-87351 aCiach, M.q(Michał),1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5619-97470 tForest pathology.g2019 Aug., v. 49, no. 4 p.e12528-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl60333x1437-47817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/efp.125283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02581naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245009900169300001600268520138100284592002801665650002301693650001401716650002001730650002101750650001001771650001001781650001501791650003301806650001401839650002901853700001601882700001601898700001801914700005601932773011601988856008202104852000902186655001202195IND60591671620221122004354.0180619e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059167162DNAL7 a10.1007/s13225-018-0396-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPaul, ShyamSundar12aA phylogenetic census of global diversity of gut anaerobic fungi and a new taxonomic framework  ap. 253-266.  aObligate anaerobic fungi of the phylum Neocallimastigomycota play a key role in digesting fibrous feeds in the gut of herbivores, but little is known about their global diversity. In this study, the collective diversity of gut anaerobic fungi was examined using all curated internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) sequences of anaerobic gut fungi available in GenBank. The 262,770 quality-checked fungal ITS1 sequences downloaded from GenBank were assigned to 274 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) at the approximate species level. Of these approximate species-equivalent (Sp-eq) OTUs, 119 were represented by at least five ITS1 sequences, with 38 containing known species and 81 containing no known species. Based on a rarefaction analysis, the currently available ITS1 sequences represent nearly all the major species of gut anaerobic fungi, but much more sequencing effort is needed to assess the actual richness of minor OTUs. One dataset of ITS1 reference sequences (referred to as AF-RefSeq) and one comprehensive taxonomic framework are also presented, and they are shown to be suitable for taxonomic classification of most of the ITS1 sequences in GenBank. The results of the present study may help guide future studies involving taxonomic and phylogenetic analysis of ITS1 sequences of anaerobic fungi and targeted isolation and characterization of new anaerobic fungi.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNeocallimastigales 3aanaerobes 3adata collection 3adigestive system 3afeeds 3afungi 3aherbivores 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3aphylogeny 3atranscription (genetics)1 aBu, Dengpan1 aXu, Jianchu1 aHyde, KevinD.1 aYu, Zhongtang1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6165-85220 tFungal diversity.g2018 Mar., v. 89, no. 1 p.253-266dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:J000000079x1560-27457nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13225-018-0396-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03157naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006200150245015200212500002200364520178200386592002802168650002502196650002302221650001702244650000902261650001102270650001702281650002102298650001402319650001602333651001302349653002402362653003602386653002002422653003102442700002602473700002302499700002302522700002102545773009702566856005102663852000902714655001202723IND60795466820221122193155.0221004e20220928xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079546682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cropro.2022.1061162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarroll, Juliet E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2518-160814aThe predation impact of ruby-throated hummingbird, Archilochus colubris, on spotted-wing drosophila, Drosophila suzukii, in raspberry, Rubus idaeus  aPre-press version  aHummingbirds require arthropods in their diet and may consume 2000 small insects per day, including drosophilids, when nesting. In New York, we investigated the use of feeders to attract Ruby-throated Hummingbirds, Archilochus colubris (Linnaeus, 1758), into red raspberry, Rubus idaeus L., to encourage predation of the spotted-wing drosophila, Drosophila suzukii Matsumura. We investigated whether fly populations and fruit infestation would be reduced in the half of the field with feeders compared to the half without. Over four years, 2015–2018, 81% of 266 hourly observations of hummingbird behavior found they were occupying the field when utilizing the feeders, supporting opportunities for predation on D. suzukii. In 2016 to 2018, when maximal hummingbird sightings were reached, significant reductions in D. suzukii trap counts and fruit infestation levels were obtained in some weeks in the half of the field provided with feeders at a density of 62 feeders/hectare. Compared to the half without feeders, the final tally of cumulative trap counts and fruit infestation levels were lower in the half of the field treated with feeders in all years. In comparing two paired commercial raspberry fields (2020), one with feeders at a density of 151 feeders/hectare and the other without feeders, presence of feeders significantly reduced trap counts in most weeks during the fruiting season. No Ruby-throated Hummingbirds were observed in the commercial field without feeders. Hummingbirds may protect fruit from D. suzukii when they are encouraged with feeders to visit and occupy raspberry plantings. The presence of hummingbirds in raspberry fields has the potential to contribute to a D. suzukii integrated management program and reduce the reliance on pesticides.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArchilochus colubris 3aDrosophila suzukii 3aRubus idaeus 3adiet 3afruits 3ahummingbirds 3aplant protection 3apredation 3araspberries 3aNew York 0aInsectivorous birds 0aConservation biological control 0aInvasive insect 0aIntegrated pest management1 aMarshall, Percival M.1 aMattoon, Nicole E.1 aWeber, Courtney A.1 aLoeb, Gregory M.0 tCrop protection.g2022 Sept. 28,  p.106116-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34114x0261-21947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cropro.2022.106116  aDNAL 7aarticle03233naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002300143245012300166300001600289520157300305592002801878650001601906650001701922650001801939650001701957650001601974650001201990650001602002650002102018650001902039650002302058650002102081650004002102650004302142650001202185650001302197650001602210650001302226650001002239650002102249653002602270653001602296653001602312653001902328653001702347700002002364700002302384700002002407700002002427700002202447773011002469856007902579852000902658655001202667IND60515041920221121180539.0160312e20150601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051504192DNAL7 a10.1089/jmf.2014.32342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKusunoki, Masataka10aBlack Soybean Extract Improves Lipid Profiles in Fenofibrate-Treated Type 2 Diabetics with Postprandial Hyperlipidemia  ap. 615-618.  aBlack soybeans (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) are known to be rich in polyphenols, including anthocyanins, and they have been consumed since ancient times for their beneficial effects on health. In addition, it has been reported that black soybean (BS) seed coat may ameliorate obesity and insulin resistance. In the present study, we administered BS extract to type 2 diabetics for 2 months to investigate the effects of BS on glycemic control and lipid metabolism parameters. In addition, we administered BS and antihyperlipidemic agent, fenofibrate, to patients with type 2 diabetes complicated by postprandial hyperlipidemia for 2 months and assessed the combined effects of fenofibrate and BS on serum lipid profile. The results showed that administration of the BS alone had no effect on the blood glucose or lipid levels, but that administration of fenofibrate alone and fenofibrate in combination with the BS significantly lowered their serum triglyceride (TG) level at fasting state, and the percent decrease in the serum TG level after combined administration was significantly higher than in the subjects who received fenofibrate alone. Furthermore, the serum LDL cholesterol concentration, which did not decrease when fenofibrate was administered alone, decreased significantly when the BS and fenofibrate were administered in combination. These results suggest that combined administration of the BS with fenofibrate enhanced the antihyperlipidemic action of fenofibrate, and the results of this study demonstrated the usefulness of the BS in clinical practice.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGlycine max 3aanthocyanins 3ablood glucose 3ablood lipids 3ablood serum 3afasting 3afenofibrate 3aglycemic control 3ahyperlipidemia 3ainsulin resistance 3alipid metabolism 3alow density lipoprotein cholesterol 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3aobesity 3apatients 3apolyphenols 3asoybeans 3atesta 3atriacylglycerols 0ablack soybean extract 0acholesterol 0afenofibrate 0ahyperlipidemia 0atriglyceride1 aSatō, Daisuke,1 aTsutsumi, Kazuhiko1 aTsutsui, Hideyo1 aNakamura, Takao1 aOshida, Yoshiharu0 tJournal of medicinal food.g2015 June 01, v. 18, no. 6 p.615-618dMary Ann Liebert, Inc.x1557-76007nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1089%2Fjmf.2014.32343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03482naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245016800167300001400335500001400349520166500363592002802028650002602056650002602082650002202108650001002130650001002140650002202150650001302172650001502185650001602200650001202216650001702228650003002245650002102275650000902296650002202305651001902327653002602346653001602372653002602388653001402414653001502428700002002443700002202463700001702485700002102502700001602523700001602539700001802555700005602573700005802629773011502687856008102802852000902883655001202892IND60723260820221120214253.0210113e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072326082DNAL7 a10.1017/S00311820200018332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJežková, Jana10aCryptosporidium ratti n. sp.

We examined the occurrence and genetic diversity of Cryptosporidium spp. in wild brown rats (Rattus norvegicus) by microscopy and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)/sequencing targeting the small subunit rDNA (SSU), actin and HSP70 genes. Out of 343 faecal samples tested, none were positive by microscopy and 55 were positive by PCR. Sequence analysis of SSU gene revealed the presence of Cryptosporidium muris (n = 4), C. andersoni (n = 3), C. ryanae (n = 1), C. occultus (n = 3), Cryptosporidium rat genotype I (n = 23), Cryptosporidium rat genotype IV (n = 16) and novel Cryptosporidium rat genotype V (n = 5). Spherical oocysts of Cryptosporidium rat genotype I obtained from naturally-infected rats, measuring 4.4–5.4 μm × 4.3–5.1 μm, were infectious to the laboratory rats, but not to the BALB/c mice (Mus musculus) nor Mongolian gerbils (Meriones unguiculatus). The prepatent period was 3 days post infection and the patent period was longer than 30 days. Naturally- and experimentally-infected rats showed no clinical signs of disease. Percentage of nucleotide similarities at the SSU, actin, HSP70 loci between C. ratti n. sp. and the rat derived C. occultus and Cryptosporidium rat genotype II, III, IV, and V ranged from 91.0 to 98.1%. These genetic variations were similar or greater than that observed between closely related species, i.e. C. parvum and C. erinacei (93.2–99.5%). Our morphological, genetic and biological data support the establishment of Cryptosporidium rat genotype I as a new species, Cryptosporidium ratti n. sp.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCryptosporidium muris 3aMeriones unguiculatus 3aRattus norvegicus 3aactin 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3agenotype 3amicroscopy 3anew species 3aoocysts 3aparasitology 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aprepatent period 3arats 3asequence analysis 3aCzech Republic 0aCryptosporidium ratti 0ainfectivity 0amorphometric analysis 0aphylogeny 0aprevalence1 aPrediger, Jitka1 aHolubová, Nikola1 aSak, Bohumil1 aKonečný, Roman1 aFeng, Yaoyu1 aXiao, Lihua1 aRost, Michael1 aMcEvoy, John1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6843-55511 aKváč, Martin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0013-60900 tParasitology.g2021 Jan., v. 148, no. 1 p.84-97dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl45572x1469-81617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00311820200018333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02974naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245011500165300001600280520167500296592002801971650002001999650001002019650001002029650001402039650000902053650001002062650001402072650001302086650001902099651002002118651001802138700001802156700002002174700001602194700001902210700002302229700002102252700005902273773011702332856008202449852000902531655001202540IND60613393320221118001658.0190424e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061339332DNAL7 a10.1007/s10886-018-0986-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDainson, Miri10aHow to Make a Mimic? Brood Parasitic Striped Cuckoo Eggs Match Host Shell Color but Not Pigment Concentrations  ap. 940-946.  aHosts of avian brood parasites often use visual cues to reject foreign eggs, and several lineages of brood parasites have evolved mimetic eggshell coloration and patterning to circumvent host recognition. What is the mechanism of parasitic egg color mimicry at the chemical level? Mimetic egg coloration by Common Cuckoos Cuculus canorus is achieved by depositing similar concentrations of colorful pigments into their shells as their hosts. The mechanism of parasitic egg color mimicry at the chemical level in other lineages of brood parasites remains unexplored. Here we report on the chemical basis of egg color mimicry in an evolutionarily independent, and poorly studied, host-parasite system: the Neotropical Striped Cuckoo Tapera naevia and one of its hosts, the Rufous-and-white Wren Thryophilus rufalbus. In most of South America, Striped Cuckoos lay white eggs that are identical to those of local host species. In Central America, however, Striped Cuckoos lay blue eggs that match those of the Rufous-and-white Wren, suggesting that blue egg color in these cuckoo populations is an adaptation to mimic host egg appearance. Here we confirm that Striped Cuckoo eggs are spectrally similar to those of their hosts and consistently contain the same major eggshell pigment, biliverdin. However, wren eggshells lacked protoporphyrin, which was present in the parasitic cuckoo eggshells. Furthermore, biliverdin concentrations were significantly lower in cuckoo eggshells than in host eggshells. Similarity of host-parasite eggshell appearance, therefore, need not always be paralleled by a quantitative chemical match to generate effective visual mimicry in birds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCuculus canorus 3abirds 3acolor 3aegg shell 3aeggs 3ahosts 3aparasites 3apigments 3aprotoporphyrin 3aCentral America 3aSouth America1 aMark, Melissa1 aHossain, Marouf1 aYoo, Barney1 aHolford, Mande1 aMcNeil, Shannon E.1 aRiehl, Christina1 aHauber, Mark E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2014-49280 tJournal of chemical ecology.g2018 Oct., v. 44, no. 10 p.940-946dSpringer USwJournal:jnl14921x0098-03317nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10886-018-0986-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01413naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001500144245008500159300001400244520058700258592002800845653002100873653001700894653001500911653002800926773010600954856007801060852000901138655001201147IND60520490020221119123910.0160521e20130920xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052049002DNAL7 a10.2478/pjct-2013-00492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJanus, Ewa10aLewis acids immobilized in ionic liquid – application for the acetal synthesis  ap. 78-80.  aCatalytic systems composed of metal chloride (InCl₃, ScCl₃, YCl₃, YbCl₃, LaCl₃, BiCl₃, ZnCl₃ and CuCl₃) and 1-butyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)-imide, [C₁C₄Pyrr][NTf₂] as ionic liquid were prepared.

We investigated the effects of postdischarge nutritional support in the outpatient setting on all-cause mortality in the populaton of malnourished medical patients in a systematic review of randomized controlled trials. We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE, from inception to December 21, 2022. Randomized-controlled trials investigating nutritional support in medical patients following hospital discharge vs. control group (usual care, placebo and no nutritional support) were included. Data were independently extracted by two authors and were pooled using random effects model. Our primary outcome was all cause-mortality up to 12-months (end of intervention) of hospital discharge. We included 14 randomized-controlled trials with a total of 2438 participants and mostly moderate trial quality. Compared to the control group, patients receiving outpatient nutritional support had lower mortality (13 trials, odds ratio [OR] 0.63, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.48 to 0.84, p = 0.001, I² = 1%). Nutritional support was also associated with a significant increase in the mean daily intake of energy (568 kcal, 95% CI 24 to 1,113, p = 0.04), proteins (24 g, 95% CI 7 to 41), p = 0.005) and body weight (1.1 kg, 95% CI 0.6 to 1.7), p < 0.001). No differences were found on hospital readmissions and handgrip strength. This meta-analysis of randomized-controlled trials with mostly moderate trial quality suggests that nutritional support in the outpatient setting significantly increases nutritional intake as well as body weight, and importantly improves survival. Further large-scale and high-quality intervention trials are needed to confirm these findings.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3abody weight 3aclinical nutrition 3aconfidence interval 3aenergy 3ahand strength 3ahospitals 3amalnutrition 3ameta-analysis 3amodels 3amortality 3anutritional support 3aodds ratio 3aplacebos 3arisk 3asystematic review 0aOutpatient 0aPost-discharge 0aNutritional therapy1 aKilchoer, Fiona1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1668-83161 aDragusha, Saranda1 aGressies, Carla1 aFaessli, Montserrat1 aGomes, Filomena1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1702-14331 aDeutz, Nicolaas E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5845-64471 aStanga, Zeno1 aMueller, Beat1 aSchuetz, Philipp1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6400-49490 tClinical nutrition.g2022 Sept. 21, dElsevier LtdwJournal:J000000059x0261-56147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clnu.2022.09.011  aDNAL 7aarticle02241naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245011700168300001600285520064400301536022000945592002801165596002401193650001501217650001701232650002201249650001901271650001701290650001101307650001201318650001101330651001301341653002001354653002601374653002101400653003501421653001201456700002401468700002001492700001701512700001601529773014301545856008601688852000901774655001201783IND60790756520221117022208.0220826e20220903xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079075652DNAL7 a10.1080/19320248.2021.20027492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFord, Olivia10aUnderstanding the Grocery Store Environment in A Michigan Urban Setting: A Case Study in A Bangladeshi Community  ap. 706-717.  aThe Banglatown area of Hamtramck, Michigan is home to Bangladeshi Americans (26% of the population) and has a 49.1% poverty rate.

Fruit Extracts Improve Colon Microflora and Exert Anti-Inflammatory Activities in Caco-2 Cells  ap. 663-676.  aIntestinal microflora and inflammation are associated with the risk of inflammatory bowel diseases. Noni (Morinda citrifolia L.) has various bioactivities, but its effect on colon health remains unknown. This study focused on the effects of fermented noni fruit extracts on colon microflora and inflammation of colon epithelial cells. The anti-inflammatory activities of ethanol and ethyl acetate extracts on Caco-2 cells were evaluated including interleukin-8 (IL-8) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). The growth of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium species was promoted by ethanol extract. Ethyl acetate extract decreased intracellular reactive oxygen species and significantly suppressed COX-2, IL-8, and prostaglandin E2 production and neutrophil chemotaxis by suppressing the translocation of the p65 subunit. Quercetin was the main contributor to the anti-inflammatory activity. The fermented noni fruit promoted probiotic growths and downregulated the intracellular oxidation and inflammation in Caco-2 cells.

Vertical c-axis orientation of GaN NRs is obtained on c-plane [0001] and a-plane [Formula: see text] sapphire and a skew or inclined NRs on r-plane, and inclined intertwined but self-aligned NR array was formed on m-plane sapphire. GaN (002) and (004) peaks were obtained on c- and a-plane sapphire, whereas (110), (103), and (103) only were observed on r- and m-planes, respectively. In the case of r- and m-plane-grown GaN, A₁ transverse optical mode is dominant, and the A₁ longitudinal optical mode is suppressed. Conversely, in the case of c- and a-plane, it is reversed. The probable reason is the optical mode vibrations difference along the differently inclined NRs surfaces. In addition, the specimen exhibits surface optical modes too. The optical behavior of GaN NR on m-sapphire shows an intensity variation when measured in different angular rotations of the specimen by photoluminescence which is because of the higher area of excitation in the case of axial surfaces and lower area of excitation in radial surface. Their epitaxial crystallographic relationship with the substrates and the reasons for the self-aligned orientations are discussed. The anomalies found in the optical behavior are attributed to Raman antenna effect and so on. The self-aligned intertwined GaN NRs find suitable applications in polarizer.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahydrides 3ananorods 3aphotoluminescence 3avapors1 aGopal Ram, S.

One of these mechanisms is the oxidation of plant phenolics by plant enzymes, such as polyphenol oxidases (PPO) and peroxidases (POD). These reactions generate a variety of products and intermediates that play important roles in resistance against herbivores. Oxidation of the catecholic phenolic compound chlorogenic acid by PPO enhances the lethality of the insect-killing bacterial pathogen, Bacillus thuringiensis var. kurstaki (Bt) to the polyphagous caterpillar, Helicoverpa zea. Since herbivore feeding damage often triggers the induction of higher activities of oxidative enzymes in plant tissues, here we hypothesized that the induction of plant defenses would enhance the lethality of Bt on those plants. We found that the lethality of a commercial formulation of Bt (Dipel® PRO DF) on tomato plants was higher if it was applied to plants that were induced by H. zea feeding or induced by the phytohormone jasmonic acid. Higher proportions of H. zea larvae killed by Bt were strongly correlated with higher levels of PPO activity in the leaflet tissue. Higher POD activity was only weakly associated with higher levels of Bt-induced mortality. While plant-mediated variation in entomopathogen lethality is well known, our findings demonstrate that plants can induce defensive responses that work in concert with a microbial insecticide/entomopathogen to protect against insect herbivores.  aPublisher supplied data  a1645548cNational Science Foundation  aAFRI 2017-67013-26596cU.S. Department of Agriculture 3aBacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki 3aHelicoverpa zea 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 3achlorogenic acid 3aentomopathogenic bacteria 3ajasmonic acid 3alarvae 3amicrobial insecticides 3amortality 3aoxidation 3aperoxidase 3aphytophagous insects 3aplant hormones 3aplant tissues 3atomatoes1 aPan, Qinjian1 aHoover, Kelli1 aFelton, Gary W.0 tJournal of chemical ecology.g2018 Oct., v. 44, no. 10 p.947-956dSpringer USwJournal:jnl14921x0098-03317nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10886-018-0987-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03029naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002200186245007600208300002000284506007600304520113200380592002801512506003701540650001001577650002801587650002701615650002301642650003101665650002401696650001001720650003501730650001101765650001401776650002201790650001801812650001501830650002601845650001801871653002001889653002001909700002601929700003101955700002001986700002802006700003002034700002502064700001902089700002302108700002002131700002402151773017602175856007902351852000902430655001202439IND60173544620221207131817.0150603e20121127xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017354462DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.12097141092doi7 aPMC35117412pmcid7 a231505622pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoehm, Anna-Marei10aFoxO is a critical regulator of stem cell maintenance in immortal Hydra  ap. 19697-19702.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aHydra ’s unlimited life span has long attracted attention from natural scientists. The reason for that phenomenon is the indefinite self-renewal capacity of its stem cells. The underlying molecular mechanisms have yet to be explored. Here, by comparing the transcriptomes of Hydra ’s stem cells followed by functional analysis using transgenic polyps, we identified the transcription factor forkhead box O (FoxO) as one of the critical drivers of this continuous self-renewal. foxO overexpression increased interstitial stem cell and progenitor cell proliferation and activated stem cell genes in terminally differentiated somatic cells. foxO down-regulation led to an increase in the number of terminally differentiated cells, resulting in a drastically reduced population growth rate. In addition, it caused down-regulation of stem cell genes and antimicrobial peptide (AMP) expression. These findings contribute to a molecular understanding of Hydra ’s immortality, indicate an evolutionarily conserved role of FoxO in controlling longevity from Hydra to humans, and have implications for understanding cellular aging.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aHydra 3aadenosine monophosphate 3aantimicrobial peptides 3acell proliferation 3agene expression regulation 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3agenetically modified organisms 3ahumans 3alongevity 3apopulation growth 3asomatic cells 3astem cells 3atranscription factors 3atranscriptome 0aadult stem cell 0adifferentiation1 aKhalturin, Konstantin1 aAnton-Erxleben, Friederike1 aHemmrich, Georg1 aKlostermeier, Ulrich C.1 aLopez-Quintero, Javier A.1 aOberg, Hans-Heinrich1 aPuchert, Malte1 aRosenstiel, Philip1 aWittlieb, Jörg1 aBosch, Thomas C.

The technology of making cheeses depends on both the quality of raw materials and the quality of enzymes that are used to curdle milk. Therefore, the study of the effect of rennet enzymes obtained using advanced biotechnology on the transformation of milk protein and amino acids into a finished product is of scientific and practical importance. Considering the above, the purpose of this study was to investigate the amino acid composition of whey and cottage cheese for the use of various enzyme preparations. Three groups of samples (n=5) were formed to set up the experiment. Cow's milk for research was selected from clinically healthy cows during the milking period. In the control group of samples, rennet of microbial origin was used for milk clotting. In the first experimental group of samples, an enzyme preparation extracted from rennet of dairy calves was used according to the method of Yu.Ya. Svyrydenko. In the second experimental group, an enzyme preparation obtained by extraction of rennet enzymes according to the method of S.V. Merzlov was used. The content of amino acids in milk, whey, and cheeses was determined by capillary electrophoresis. Studying the milk used for the experiment, it was found that the content of amino acids (lysine, methionine + cystine, tryptophane, valine, leucine, isoleucine, phenylalanine + tyrosine, proline, serine, alanine, glycine, histidine, arginine, aspartic acid and glutamine) did not significantly differ from the typical indicators of milk obtained in central Ukraine. It was found that the use of rennet enzymes extracted according to the method of S.V. Merzlov is accompanied by a decrease in the content of amino acids in serum by an average of 15.9%  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aalanine 3aamino acid composition 3aarginine 3aaspartic acid 3abiotechnology 3ablood serum 3acapillary electrophoresis 3acottage cheese 3acystine 3aenzymes 3aglutamine 3ahistidine 3aisoleucine 3aleucine 3alysine 3amethionine 3amilk 3amilk proteins 3aphenylalanine 3aproline 3arennet 3aserine 3atyrosine 3avaline 3awhey 3aUkraine 0amilk clotting 0acasein 0awhey proteins 0aenzyme preparation1 aMerzlov, Serhiy1 aNarizhnyy, Serhiy1 aMashkin, Yurii1 aMerzlova, Galyna0 tNaukovì gorizonti.g2022 Jan., v. 24, no. 9 p.29-25dZhytomyr National Agroecological UniversitywJournal:27917x2663-21447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.48077/scihor.24(9).2021.19-253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02824naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245017100162300001600333520132300349592002801672650001501700650001801715650001401733650001201747650001801759650002201777650001001799650001901809650002101828650001701849650001101866653003001877653003301907653001501940653002501955700001101980700001601991700001802007700001302025700001502038700001302053700005902066773012502125856008302250852000902333655001202342IND60685109920221116234745.0200412e20200615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068510992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2020.02.1102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFu, Yunqi10aIn-situ chemical vapor deposition to fabricate Cuprous oxide/copper sulfide core-shell flowers with boosted and stable wide-spectral region photocatalytic performance  ap. 143-152.  aCu₂O is widely used in the visible-light photocatalytic field, but its photocatalytic activity and stability still need to be further enhanced. Thus, searching for an efficient method to inhibit photocorrosion of Cu₂O and boost its photogenerated charge carriers’ separation is very important and challenging. Herein, Cu₂O@CuS core-shell hexapetalous flowers were synthesized by hydrothermal and in-situ chemical vapor deposition (CVD) strategy. The Cu₂O hexapetalous flowers were firstly obtained through hydrothermal procedure, and then CuS in-situ grew on Cu₂O to form core-shell structure by CVD, which effectively inhibited the photocorrosion of Cu₂O. Meanwhile, Cu₂O@CuS core-shell structure could extend their light absorption ranges from 200 to 1500 nm; promote the separation of electrons and holes in photocatalytic system. Thus, under the wide-spectral region, Cu₂O@CuS exhibited excellent photocatalytic performance for the degradation of tetracycline at 91% with good cycling ability, resulting from the effective separation of photogenerated charges, more free radicals such as OH and O₂⁻, increases of utilization rate of visible-light. These results indicate that in-situ CVD strategy is a feasible method to improve visible-light photocatalytic activity and stability of Cu₂O.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3acuprous oxide 3aelectrons 3aflowers 3afree radicals 3ahydroxyl radicals 3alight 3aphotocatalysis 3asuperoxide anion 3atetracycline 3avapors 0aChemical vapor deposition 0aCuprous oxide/Copper sulfide 0aCore-shell 0aWide-spectral Region1 aLi, Qi1 aLiu, Jianan1 aJiao, Yanqing1 aHu, Shan1 aWang, Hong1 aXu, Shuo1 aJiang, Baojiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1855-48640 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2020 June 15, v. 570 p.143-152dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2020.02.1103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02404naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002800144245009400172300001400266520103300280592002801313650001901341650002101360650001101381650001301392650001601405650002001421650003101441650001601472650001301488650001101501650001101512650001401523650001601537650001001553650001201563650001401575651001001589653001201599653002101611653002001632653002101652653002201673700002401695773010401719856007801823852000901901655001201910IND60485892420221116143837.0160218e20130327xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048589242DNAL7 a10.2478/jppr-2013-00082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChahil, Gurminder Singh10aBiology of Pieris Brassicae (Linn.) on Different Brassica Species in the Plains of Punjab  ap. 53-59.  aBiology of Pieris brassicae reared on Brassica napus, B. juncea, B. rapa, and B. carinata was studied. Adult butterflies, collected in November from the plains of Punjab, India, were sexed, paired, and released onto the four Brassica spp. in a greenhouse. In a multigeneration study (Parental, F1, and F2), the effect of the four Brassica spp. on the egg laying, incubation period and hatching percentage was assessed in a greenhouse study. Hatched larvae were collected, reared on fresh leaves of respective Brassica spp, in laboratory conditions. Data collected on larval stadia, pre-pupal and pupal durations, adult longevity, and sex ratio were assessed to understand the effects of these four species. Of the four species, B. carinata, with a shorter incubation period, higher hatching percentage, and shorter developmental periods was most susceptible. In this study, B. rapa was the most resistant species and may be recommended for further breeding programs in order to reduce the economic damage caused by P. brassicae.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrassica napus 3aPieris brassicae 3aadults 3abreeding 3abutterflies 3adata collection 3agreenhouse experimentation 3agreenhouses 3ahatching 3alarvae 3aleaves 3alongevity 3aoviposition 3apupae 3arearing 3asex ratio 3aIndia 0abiology 0aBrassica species 0amultigeneration 0aPieris brassicae 0aresistant species1 aKular, Jagdev Singh0 tJournal of plant protection research.g2013 Mar. 27, v. 53, no. 1 p.53-59dVersitax1899-007X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/jppr-2013-00083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02625naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100001800186245012600204300002000330506007600350520102900426592002801455506003701483650001401520650001401534650002301548650001501571650001701586650001901603650001801622650001401640650001101654650002201665650001701687653002101704653001901725700001201744700002401756700001701780700001501797700001101812700001301823700001901836773017601855856007902031852000902110655001202119IND60173544720221207131805.0150603e20121127xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017354472DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.12103151092doi7 aPMC35117162pmcid7 a231505702pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Yunlong10aHierarchical mesoporous perovskite La₀.₅Sr₀.₅CoO₂.₉₁ nanowires with ultrahigh capacity for Li-air batteries  ap. 19569-19574.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aLithium-air batteries have captured worldwide attention due to their highest energy density among the chemical batteries. To provide continuous oxygen channels, here, we synthesized hierarchical mesoporous perovskite La ₀.₅Sr ₀.₅CoO ₂.₉₁ (LSCO) nanowires. We tested the intrinsic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity in both aqueous electrolytes and nonaqueous electrolytes via rotating disk electrode (RDE) measurements and demonstrated that the hierarchical mesoporous LSCO nanowires are high-performance catalysts for the ORR with low peak-up potential and high limiting diffusion current. Furthermore, we fabricated Li-air batteries on the basis of hierarchical mesoporous LSCO nanowires and nonaqueous electrolytes, which exhibited ultrahigh capacity, ca. over 11,000 mAh⋅g –¹, one order of magnitude higher than that of LSCO nanoparticles. Besides, the possible reaction mechanism is proposed to explain the catalytic activity of the LSCO mesoporous nanowire.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abatteries 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3aelectrodes 3aelectrolytes 3aenergy density 3ananoparticles 3ananowires 3aoxygen 3aoxygen production 3aporous media 0aelectrocatalysis 0aenergy storage1 aXu, Lin1 aMai, L.q(Liqiang),1 aHan, Chunhua1 aAn, Qinyou1 aXu, Xu1 aLiu, Xue1 aZhang, Qingjie0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2012 Nov. 27, v. 109, no. 48 p.19569-19574dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.12103151093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03724naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006300148245017500211500002200386520224600408592002802654650001102682650002802693650001502721650002802736650002302764650003702787650001902824650002202843650001102865650001702876653002602893653001802919653003202937653001202969653001502981653002102996700006203017700006103079773009203140856004903232852000903281655001203290IND60795467220221121024604.0221004e20220925xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079546722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.clnu.2022.09.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGraybeal, Austin J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4520-923010aVisual body composition assessment methods: A 4-compartment model comparison of smartphone-based artificial intelligence for body composition estimation in healthy adults  aPre-press version  aVisual body composition (VBC) estimates produced from smartphone-based artificial intelligence represent a user-friendly and convenient way to automate body composition remotely and without the inherent geographical and monetary restrictions of other body composition methods. However, there are limited studies that have assessed the reliability and agreement of this method and thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate VBC estimates compared to a 4-compartment (4C) criterion model. A variety of body composition assessments were conducted across 184 healthy adult participants (114 F, 70 M) including dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and bioimpedance spectroscopy for utilization in the 4C model and automated assessments produced from two smartphone applications (Amazon Halo®, HALO; and myBVI®®) using either Apple® or Samsung® phones. Body composition components were compared to a 4C model using equivalence testing, root mean square error (RMSE), and Bland–Altman analysis. Separate analyses by sex and racial/ethnic groups were conducted. Precision metrics were conducted for 183 participants using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC), root mean squared coefficients of variation (RMS-%CV) and precision error (PE). Only %fat produced from HALO devices demonstrated equivalence with the 4C model although mean differences for HALO were <±1.0 kg for FM and FFM. RMSEs ranged from 3.9% to 6.2% for %fat and 3.1–5.2 kg for FM and FFM. Proportional bias was apparent for %fat across all VBC applications but varied for FM and FFM. Validity metrics by sex and specific racial/ethnic groups varied across applications. All VBC applications were reliable for %fat, fat mass (FM), and fat-free mass (FFM) with ICCs ≥0.99, RMS-%CV between 0.7% and 4.3%, and PEs between 0.3% and 0.6% for %fat and 0.2–0.5 kg for FM and FFM including assessments between smartphone types. Smartphone-based VBC estimates produce reliable body composition estimates but their equivalence with a 4C model varies by the body composition component being estimated and the VBC being employed. VBC estimates produced by HALO appear to have the lowest error, but proportional bias and estimates by sex and race vary across applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aartificial intelligence 3aautomation 3abioelectrical impedance 3aclinical nutrition 3adual-energy X-ray absorptiometry 3alean body mass 3amobile telephones 3amodels 3aspectroscopy 0aDigital anthropometry 0aMobile health 0aBody composition assessment 0aObesity 0aSmartphone 0aMachine learning1 aBrandner, Caleb F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6870-62911 aTinsley, Grant M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0230-65860 tClinical nutrition.g2022 Sept. 25, dElsevier LtdwJournal:J000000059x0261-56147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clnu.2022.09.014  aDNAL 7aarticle02984naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245006400174300001600238520149800254592002801752650002401780650000801804650002201812650001301834650002901847650001101876650001401887650001301901650001501914650000901929650001301938650001001951650000901961650001901970650001401989653001802003653002002021653001602041653002102057700002602078700002802104700002702132700002102159700003102180700002102211773013802232856008702370852000902457655001202466IND60791470020221121041526.0220830e20220820xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079147002DNAL7 a10.5958/2277-8934.2022.00033.92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRashad, Dina E.M.10aEpididymal Based Changes in Spermatozoa of Dromedary Camels  ap. 237-244.  aThis study was aimed to declare the role of epididymal passage on semen features, DNA integrity and ultrastructures changes in dromedary camel. The testes with attached epididymis of mature dromedary camels (n=50) were collected during the rutting season from December to April. The harvested spermatozoa from the three-main anatomical epididymal segments (Head, body and tail) were assessed for semen characters, DNA integrity as well as, ultra-structural changes. A significant difference in semen features (individual motility, sperm count, membrane and acrosome intactness, viability, normality, maturity, abnormalities and acrosome length and perimeter) among different epididymal segments. Spermatozoa from epididymal tail showed a significantly (p<0.05) lower DNA fragmentation than those collected from head segment while agarose gel electrophoresis revealed non-significant difference in DNA intensity between spermatozoa from the three epididymal regions. Ultra-structures of the epididymal spermatozoa showed changes in acrosome shape, sub-acrosomal space, chromatin condensation and protoplasmic droplet during epididymal passage. The protoplasmic droplets varied in size, density and position with the epididymal segments. In conclusion, epididymal passage (from the head to the tail) is an essential pre-request for dromedary camels’ spermatozoa to attain high fertilising capacity through its great influence on spermatozoa characteristics and the fine cytological structures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCamelus dromedarius 3aDNA 3aDNA fragmentation 3aacrosome 3aagar gel electrophoresis 3acamels 3achromatin 3adroplets 3aepididymis 3ahead 3aresearch 3asemen 3atail 3aultrastructure 3aviability 0aDNA integrity 0aDromedary camel 0aSpermatozoa 0aUltra-structures1 aKandiel, Mohamed M.M.1 aEl-Khawagah, Ahmed R.M.1 aMahmoud, Karima Gh.

After inducement of CCI, significant increases in the number of paw lifts from a cold plate test (cold allodynia) and decreased paw withdrawal threshold in the von Frey hair stimulation test (mechanical allodynia) were observed. However, these cold and mechanical allodynia were markedly alleviated by berberine administration in a dose-dependent manner. Sciatic nerve myeloperoxidase and malondialdehyde activities were also attenuated by berberine administration. Continuous injection for 7 days induced no development of tolerance. The antiallodynic effect of 20 mg/kg berberine was comparable to that of amitriptyline 10 mg/kg. This study demonstrated that berberine could mitigate allodynia induced by CCI, a neuropathic pain model, and it suggested that the anti-inflammatory and antioxidative properties of berberine contributed to the antiallodynic effect in the CCI model.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidant activity 3aberberine 3acold 3adose response 3amalondialdehyde 3amodels 3amyeloperoxidase 3anerve tissue 3apain 3arats 0aanti-inflammatory agents 0aantioxidants 0aberberine 0ahyperalgesia 0aneuralgia0 tJournal of medicinal food.g2015 Aug. 01, v. 18, no. 8 p.909-915dMary Ann Liebert, Inc.x1557-76007nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1089%2Fjmf.2014.33463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01930naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100001700189245006200206300001500268506007600283520084000359592002801199506003701227650001301264650000901277650001001286650001501296650001201311650000901323650001101332700002001343773011301363856008301476852000901559655001201568IND60528099920221207091813.0190417e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052809992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cois.2016.02.0132doi7 aPMC48272592pmcid7 a270880762pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQuan, Honghu14aThe evolution of insect germline specification strategies  ap. 99-105.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe establishment of the germline is essential for sexually reproducing organisms. In animals, there are two major strategies to specify the germline: maternal provision and zygotic induction. The molecular basis of the maternal provision mode has been well characterized in several model organisms (fly, frog, fish, and nematode), while that of the zygotic induction mode has mainly been studied in mammalian models such as the mouse. Shifts in germline determination modes occur unexpectedly frequently and many such shifts have occurred several times among insects. Given their general tractability and rapidly increasing genomic and genetic tools applicable to many species, the insects present a uniquely powerful model system for understanding major transitions in reproductive strategies, and developmental processes in general.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aNematoda 3afish 3afrogs 3agerm cells 3ainsects 3amice 3amodels1 aLynch, Jeremy A0 tCurrent opinion in insect science.g2016 Feb., v. 13 p.99-105dElsevier Inc.wJournal:23301x2214-57457nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cois.2016.02.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02654naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002400152245009200176300001600268520128200284592002801566650002401594650001901618650001101637650001101648650001001659650001401669650001601683650001901699650001401718650002501732650000901757650001301766650002001779650001801799650001101817651001701828653001001845653001601855653001101871653002201882700002001904700001401924773013801938856008702076852000902163655001202172IND60791470220221121031623.0220830e20220820xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079147022DNAL7 a10.5958/2277-8934.2022.00035.22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarwa-Babiker, A.M.10aHistological Study of Prenatal Development of the Spleen in Camel (Camelus Dromedarius)  ap. 251-255.  aSpleen development in the camel foetus was studied during the 1ˢᵗ, 2ⁿᵈ and 3ʳᵈ trimesters of gestation using histological techniques. Ten spleens of camel foetuses were collected from Omran slaughterhouse, Al-Ahsa, Saudi Arabia. The samples were prepared by routine histological procedures and stained by the general histological stain (H and E) and some other special stains including Van Geison’s for collagenous fibres, Verhoff’s for elastic fibres, Gordon and Sweet for reticular fibres. At the 1ˢᵗ trimester, the spleen capsule was composed of fine connective tissue fibres, in the 2ⁿᵈ trimester the capsule and trabeculae showed thick connective tissue, while in the 3ʳᵈ trimester the capsule also showed smooth muscle fibres and surrounded with large amount of adipose tissue. The parenchyma, at the 1st trimester consisted of randomly distributed lymphocytes and macrophages. At the 2ⁿᵈ and 3ʳᵈ trimesters, it was arranged as white and red pulps. Megakaryocytes observed previously in the red pulp of adult dromedary camel were seen in the red pulp at the 1ˢᵗ, 2ⁿᵈ and 3ʳᵈ trimesters of gestation. It was concluded that the spleen showed very important histological developmental changes throughout the three gestational stages.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCamelus dromedarius 3aadipose tissue 3aadults 3acamels 3afetus 3ahistology 3amacrophages 3amegakaryocytes 3apregnancy 3aprenatal development 3apulp 3aresearch 3aslaughterhouses 3asmooth muscle 3aspleen 3aSaudi Arabia 0aCamel 0aDevelopment 0aFoetus 0aGestational stage1 aAlthnaian, T.A.1 aAli, A.M.0 tJournal of camel practice and research.g2022 Aug. 20, v. 29, no. 2 p.251-255dCamel Publishing HousewJournal:21647x2277-89347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.5958/2277-8934.2022.00035.23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03455naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001600166245006500182300001800247520138900265592002801654650002201682650002201704650001401726650002301740650003101763650002401794650001001818650001301828650001401841650001901855650001601874650004301890650001001933650002401943650002701967650002301994650002702017650003802044650002702082650002002109650003202129650004302161650002802204650001502232650001402247650004402261650005302305650002202358650004202380650003802422650003802460700001202498700001902510700001702529700001502546700001802561700001602579773009602595856008102691852000902772655001202781IND50070593020221118102923.0150210e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007059302DNAL7 a240137942pmid7 a10.1007/s00299-013-1501-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Shaohui10aWheat gene TaS3 contributes to powdery mildew susceptibility  ap. 1891-1901.  aKEY MESSAGE : Identification of TaS3 as a potential susceptibility gene encoding a protein homologous to ULP1 protease in wheat, which may regulate SUMO function facilitating powdery mildew attack. Some plant genes that are required for susceptibilities to certain pathogens are known as susceptibility genes or susceptibility factors, whose loss-of-function mutations can confer the plants resistances. To identify potential susceptibility genes to powdery mildew in wheat, differentially expressed genes in compatible and incompatible interactions between wheat and powdery mildew were examined by the cDNA chip assay. The genes exclusively expressed in the susceptible cultivar were interfered using biolistic transient transformation in wheat epidermal cells. The suppression of gene TaS3 (Triticum aestivum susceptibility) decreased the pathogen penetration by 19 %, and its over-expression increased the disease susceptibility. The deduced protein from TaS3 belongs to the putative ubiquitin-like protease 1 peptidase domain family. Subcellular localization studies revealed that its protein was accumulated in the nucleus. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that TaS3 transcript was significantly induced in the compatible host. This suggests that TaS3 is a potential susceptible gene and its function may be related to regulate SUMO functions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTriticum aestivum 3acomplementary DNA 3acultivars 3adisease resistance 3agene expression regulation 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3amutation 3apathogens 3apowdery mildew 3aproteinases 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3awheat 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAscomycotaxphysiology 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDisease Susceptibility 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGenes, Plantxgenetics 2aGenes, Reporter 2aGenetic Association Studies 2aGreen Fluorescent Proteinsxmetabolism 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPenetrance 2aPhylogeny 2aPlant Diseasesxgeneticsxmicrobiology. 2aPlant Proteinsxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aProtein Transport 2aRNA, Messengerxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSubcellular Fractionsxmetabolism 2aTriticumxgeneticsxmicrobiology.1 aJi, Rui1 aDudler, Robert1 aYong, Mingli1 aDeng, Qide1 aWang, Zhengyi1 aHu, Dongwei0 tPlant cell reports.g2013 Dec., v. 32, no. 12 p.1891-1901dSpringer-Verlagx0721-77147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00299-013-1501-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03052naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245012800166300001400294500001400308520140200322592002801724650001301752650001801765650001601783650001401799650000901813650002501822650002201847650002401869650001501893650002301908650001401931650001501945650001701960650001301977650002101990651002002011651001002031653001302041653001302054653001902067653002102086653002502107653001402132653001602146700001702162700001602179700002302195700006302218773011502281856008102396852000902477655001202486IND60723261520221120071113.0210113e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072326152DNAL7 a10.1017/S00311820200020002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTomé, Beatriz10aParasites in a hotspot: diversity and specificity patterns of apicomplexans infecting reptiles from the Socotra Archipelago  ap. 42-52.  aNAL-light  aAlthough parasites represent a major component of biodiversity, they remain poorly assessed, especially in remote regions. In this study, we screened 461 reptiles from Socotra, the largest and most biologically diverse archipelago in Arabia. Using 18S rRNA primers, we detected various apicomplexan parasites, namely haemogregarines, sarcocystids and eimeriids. Haemogregarines were the most common and genetically diverse, followed by sarcocystids (genus Sarcocystis) and eimeriids (genera Isospora and Lankesterella). All were related to parasites of other reptiles, including species from Arabia, Northern Africa and Asia. Like their 29 endemic reptile hosts, almost all Socotran parasites presented high genetic divergence and ecological differences from those found elsewhere, and probably represent undescribed endemic species. Among hosts, skinks were the most parasitized, which contrasted with similar studies from other areas, probably due to their more generalist diet and habitat use. As expected due to its high species richness, geckos harboured the highest parasite diversity in the archipelago. Parasite diversity also seemed to be correlated to island size, as the largest island harboured most haplotypes. This study emphasizes the importance of screening parasites in wild hosts from remote regions and of considering host ecology to understand disease transmission across taxa.  aPublisher supplied data 3aIsospora 3aLankesterella 3aSarcocystis 3aScincidae 3adiet 3adisease transmission 3agenetic variation 3ahabitat preferences 3ahaplotypes 3aindigenous species 3aparasites 3aparasitism 3aparasitology 3areptiles 3aspecies richness 3aNorthern Africa 3aYemen 0aEimeriid 0aendemism 0ahaemogregarine 0ahost-specificity 0aIndian Ocean islands 0aphylogeny 0asarcocystid1 aMaia, João,1 aPerera, Ana1 aCarranza, Salvador1 aVasconcelos, Raquel1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4717-94290 tParasitology.g2021 Jan., v. 148, no. 1 p.42-52dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl45572x1469-81617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00311820200020003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03182naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245012600167300001800293520166900311592002801980650001202008650001402020650002602034650001602060650001802076650001202094650001402106650001302120650001802133650001702151650001302168650000902181650001002190650001402200650001102214650001402225651001002239653001602249653001602265653002602281653002002307700002102327700001902348700001702367700001802384773016702402856008602569852000902655655001202664IND60598212220221116234118.0190416e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059821222DNAL7 a10.1016/S2095-3119(17)61771-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Min,10aWhy high grain yield can be achieved in single seedling machine-transplanted hybrid rice under dense planting conditions?  ap. 1299-1306.  aThis study was conducted to identify the factors associated with high grain yield in single seedling machine-transplanted hybrid rice under dense planting conditions. Field experiments were done in Yong'an Town, Hunan Province, China in 2015 and 2016. Two hybrid rice cultivars were grown under single seedling machine transplanting (SMT) and conventional machine transplanting (CMT) at a high planting density in each year. Grain yield and yield attributes were compared between SMT and CMT. Averaged across cultivars and years, grain yield was 12% higher under SMT than under CMT. Plant height, basal stem width, and shoot and root dry weights were higher in seedlings for SMT than those for CMT. SMT had less maximum tiller number per m2 and consequently less panicle number per m2 than did CMT. Branch number per panicle, especially the secondary branch number per panicle, and spikelet number per cm of panicle length were more under SMT than under CMT, which resulted in more spikelet number per panicle under SMT than under CMT. SMT had higher or equal spikelet filling percentage than did CMT. The difference in grain weight between SMT and CMT was relatively small and inconsistent cross years. SMT had higher or equal total biomass and harvest index than did CMT. Dry weight per stem under SMT was heavier than that under CMT. Larger leaf area per stem was partly responsible for the heavier dry weight per stem under SMT than under CMT. Our study suggests that improvement in seedling quality, panicle size, and dry weight per stem are critical to the high grain yield in single seedling machine-transplanted hybrid rice under dense planting conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3acultivars 3afield experimentation 3agrain yield 3aharvest index 3ahybrids 3aleaf area 3apanicles 3aplant density 3aplant height 3aplanting 3arice 3aroots 3aseedlings 3ashoots 3aspikelets 3aChina 0agrain yield 0ahybrid rice 0amachine transplanting 0asingle seedling1 aSHAN, Shuang-lü1 aXIE, Xiao-bing1 aCAO, Fang-bo1 aZOU, Ying-bin0 tJournal of integrative agriculture.g2018 June, v. 17, no. 6 p.1299-1306dElsevier B.V.aCAAS.

These two stresses frequently coexist in calcareous salt-affected soils. To better understand how plants adapt to these combined stresses, we investigated the interactive effects of salinity and P availability on photosynthetic activity, leaf pigment, phenolic compounds content and antioxidant activity in Aeluropus littoralis (Gouan)Parl., a promising C4 monocotyledonous halophyte that usually grows in dry salty areas or marshes. Plants were grown hydroponically under low or sufficient P supply (5 or 180µM KH2PO4 respectively), with or without 400mM NaCl. When individually applied, salinity and P deficiency stresses significantly restricted shoot and root relative growth rate, with a more marked effect of the former stress. However, the effects of the two stresses combined were non-additive on plant growth. Our results showed that salinity and P deficiency stresses applied individually or combined have no significant effect on CO2 assimilation rate, instantaneous water-use efficiency (WUEi), and leaf malondialdehyde content. Chlorophyll, carotoneoids, anthocyanins and phenolics content increased significantly under both P shortage and salt stresses applied individually or combined. Furthermore, a strong correlation was found between both total antioxidant capacity and DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl) radical scavenging activity and shoot phenolics and carotenoids contents. These results suggest that the ability of A. littoralis to cope with both P deficiency and high salt stresses is a result of several mechanisms mainly involved in the conservation of the integrity of the photosynthetic apparatus. Secondary metabolites – mainly phenolic compounds and carotenoids – play an important role in the protection of A. littoralis plants against oxidative damage under combined high salinity and P deficiency stresses.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aAeluropus 3aanthocyanins 3aantioxidant activity 3acarbon dioxide 3acarotenoids 3achlorophyll 3aenvironmental factors 3agas exchange 3ahalophytes 3ahydroponics 3aleaves 3amalondialdehyde 3amarshes 3aphosphorus 3aphotosynthesis 3aplant growth 3apotassium dihydrogen phosphate 3aroots 3asalinity 3asalt stress 3asecondary metabolites 3ashoots 3asodium chloride 3asoil 3awater use efficiency 0ahalophytes 0aleaf pigments 0aphotosynthesis 0asecondary metabolites 0awater use efficiency1 aHessini, Kamel1 aTrabelsi, Najla1 aZribi, Fethia1 aHamdi, Abdelwahed1 aKsouri, Riadh1 aAbdelly, Chedly0 tAustralian journal of botany.g2017, v. 65, no. 5 p.453-462dCSIRO Publishingx0067-19247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/BT170893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01938naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245013700175300001800312520082000330592002801150650001601178650002501194650001501219651001001234653001701244653003101261653001601292653001501308653001601323700002901339773013701368856008601505852000901591655001201600IND60790757120221117021219.0220909e20220914xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079075712DNAL7 a10.1080/21683565.2022.21044212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPassaro, Alessandro10aSpaces of sustainable transformation at territorial level: an analysis of biodistricts and their role for agroecological transitions  ap. 1198-1223.  aThe aim of this paper is to generate solid and harmonized evidence on the level of agroecological transition of biodistricts, by looking at several characteristics such as a biodiverse environment, inclusive societal and cultural values, sustainable economic development, sound governance systems and organic, regenerative agricultural practices. We analyze the level of agroecological transition of three specific biodistricts in Italy on the territories where they are present: the case studies are in Casentino, Chianti, and Trento. We aim to understand to which extent the members within a biodistrict and, in general, the biodistrict as a community are promoting agroecology. The application of the CAET-TAPE assessment from FAO shows that the biodistricts are performing solidly on agroecological transitions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagroecology 3aeconomic development 3agovernance 3aItaly 0aFood systems 0asustainability transitions 0aagroecology 0agovernance 0aterritories1 aRandelli, F.q(Filippo),0 tAgroecology and sustainable food systems.g2022 Sept. 14, v. 46, no. 8 p.1198-1223dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12333x2168-35737nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/21683565.2022.21044213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03692naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002000144245019600164300001400360520207700374592002802451650001902479650001502498650002502513650001202538650002602550650001602576650001102592650001702603650001802620650001802638650002802656650002102684650001002705650001102715650001102726650001702737650001402754650001502768651001102783653002702794653001602821653001602837653002202853653001702875653002402892653002102916700002202937773010402959856007803063852000903141655001203150IND60485892820221116143829.0160218e20130327xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048589282DNAL7 a10.2478/jppr-2013-00122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatysiak, Kinga10aEffect of Chlorocholine Chloride and Triazoles – Tebuconazole and Flusilazole on Winter Oilseed Rape (Brassica Napus Var.

Any change in plant density significantly affects the morphological characteristics and yield of the crop. In addition, plant growth habit can be modified by the use of plant growth regulators. Apart from plant growth regulators like eg. chlorocholine chloride some triazoles have dual properties (fungicide and plant growth regulator) eg. tebuconazole. The trials were carried out in the years 2006-2008 at the Institute of Plant Protection - National Research Institute in Poznan (Poland). The treatments consisted of chlorocholine chloride, tebuconazole and flusilazole applied in spring at the growth stage BBCH 30 and BBCH 50 of winter oilseed rape. The field trials were conducted with two sowing densities of winter oilseed rape: 60 seeds/ m² and 120 seeds/m². The vegetation seasons varied according to the weather conditions, and the second testing year was characterised by drought in May and June. In the experiments plant height, SPAD units, number of siliques per plant, seed number per silique, weight of thousand seeds, yield, protein and fat content in the seeds were estimated. The increase of silique numbers per plant appeared only at the lower sowing density as a result of the application of tebuconazole or a mixture of tebuconazole with CCC. Flusilazole had a positive impact on seed number per silique. At both sowing densities, changes in the weight of a thousand seeds under the influence of the test preparations, were observed only in that year which had wet weather conditions. A more favourable effect of the test substances on the weight of a thousand seeds was obtained at the lower sowing density. All the tested substances positively affected SPAD unit values at the lower sowing density. At the higher sowing density, SPAD unit values increased after the application of flusilazole, and after a mixture of CCC + tebuconazole. The tested substances had a positive impact on plant yield but they did not affect the protein and fat content in oilseed rape seeds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrassica napus 3acrop yield 3adevelopmental stages 3adrought 3afield experimentation 3aflusilazole 3afruits 3agrowth habit 3alipid content 3aplant density 3aplant growth substances 3aplant protection 3aseeds 3asowing 3aspring 3atebuconazole 3atriazoles 3avegetation 3aPoland 0achlorocholine chloride 0achlorophyll 0aflusilazole 0agrowth regulation 0atebuconazole 0awinter oilseed rape 0ayield components1 aKaczmarek, Sylwia0 tJournal of plant protection research.g2013 Mar. 27, v. 53, no. 1 p.79-88dVersitax1899-007X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/jppr-2013-00123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03191naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245015900170300001400329500001400343520149200357592002801849650003201877650001801909650000901927650001001936650002201946650002001968650001001988650001601998650001702014650001602031650001602047650002402063650001702087650002802104650002002132650001002152653001702162653002502179653001502204653001902219653001602238700001502254700002802269700002702297700001602324700003302340700005902373773011502432856008102547852000902628655001202637IND60723261620221120051706.0210113e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072326162DNAL7 a10.1017/S00311820200020122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJoekel, Deborah E.10aAgranulocytosis leads to intestinal Echinococcus multilocularis oncosphere invasion and hepatic metacestode development in naturally resistant Wistar rats  ap. 53-62.  aNAL-light  aSusceptibility to Echinococcus multilocularis infection considerably varies among intermediate (mostly rodents) and dead-end host species (e.g. humans and pig), in particular regarding intestinal oncosphere invasion and subsequent hepatic metacestode development. Wistar rats are highly resistant to infection and subsequent diseases upon oral inoculation with E. multilocularis eggs, however, after immunosuppressive treatment with dexamethasone, rats become susceptible. To address the role of the cellular innate immunity, Wistar rats were individually or combined depleted of natural killer (NK) cells, macrophages (MΦ) and granulocytes (polymorphonuclear cells, PMN) prior to E. multilocularis egg inoculation. Although NK cell and MΦ depletion did not alter the resistance status of rats, the majority of PMN-depleted animals developed liver metacestodes within 10 weeks, indicating that PMN are key players in preventing oncosphere migration and/or development in Wistar rats. In vitro studies indicated that resistance is not caused by neutrophil reactive oxygen species or NETosis. Also, light microscopical examinations of the small intestine showed that oral inoculation of E. multilocularis eggs does not elicit a mucosal neutrophil response, suggesting that the interaction of oncospheres and neutrophils may occur after the former have entered the peripheral blood. We suggest to consider granulocytes as mediators of resistance in more resistant species, such as humans.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEchinococcus multilocularis 3adexamethasone 3aeggs 3ahosts 3aimmunosuppression 3ainnate immunity 3aliver 3amacrophages 3ametacestodes 3aneutrophils 3aoncospheres 3aoral administration 3aparasitology 3areactive oxygen species 3asmall intestine 3aswine 0agranulocytes 0aoncosphere migration 0aresistance 0asusceptibility 0aWistar rats1 aNur, Selim1 aMonné Rodriguez, Josep1 aKronenberg, Philipp A.1 aKipar, Anja1 aLeibundGut-Landmann, Salomé1 aDeplazes, Peter1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1118-54050 tParasitology.g2021 Jan., v. 148, no. 1 p.53-62dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl45572x1469-81617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00311820200020123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02840naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245014600166300001800312520112200330592002801452650000801480650001801488650000901506650001201515650002201527650001201549650003101561650002401592650001001616650002101626650001001647650002201657650002901679650002601708650001801734650001701752653001601769653002801785653001801813653002201831700001501853700001701868700001601885700001901901700002001920700001801940700001801958700002001976700001601996773016702012856008602179852000902265655001202274IND60598212320221116233821.0190416e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059821232DNAL7 a10.1016/S2095-3119(17)61777-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Nan,10aTranscriptomes of early developing tassels under drought stress reveal differential expression of genes related to drought tolerance in maize  ap. 1276-1288.  aTassel, the male reproductive organs in maize, its development is adversely affected by drought during tasseling. To determine drought tolerance mechanisms of tassel differentiation at transcriptome level, RNA-Seq was performed using RNA of early developing tassel from 10 maize inbred lines under well-watered (control) and drought-stressed conditions, respectively. Results showed that the most active pathway for drought stress in maize were related to metabolic regulation at RNA level. And some genes, encoding enzymes involved in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, were significantly down-regulated in drought-stressed plants. While, the transcription factors and genes, encoding catabolic or degradative enzymes, were over-expressed in maize early developing tassels under drought-stressed conditions, and among them, the transcripts of genes encoding exon-junction complexes involved in ‘RNA transcript’ and ‘mRNA surveillance’ pathways were significantly affected by drought stress. In addition, many other genes related to drought stress showed transcriptional changes at the later period of stress.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA 3acarbohydrates 3acorn 3adrought 3adrought tolerance 3aenzymes 3agene expression regulation 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3alipid metabolism 3amales 3asequence analysis 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 3atranscriptome 3awater stress 0aZea mays L. 0aearly developing tassel 0atranscriptome 0adrought tolerance1 aLi, Liang,1 aGAO, Wen-wei1 aWU, Yong-bo1 aYONG, Hong-jun1 aWENG, Jian-feng1 aLi, Mingshun,1 aZHANG, De-gui1 aHAO, Zhuan-fang1 aLI, Xin-hai0 tJournal of integrative agriculture.g2018 June, v. 17, no. 6 p.1276-1288dElsevier B.V.aCAAS.

So far, high resistance to many of the insecticides’ active substances has been found. The work presents the current status of the pollen beetle susceptibility level to deltamethrin and beta-cyfluthrin, pointing to the beetle’s medium, high or very high resistance to both active substances. Also, pollen beetle resistance mechanisms to deltamethrin were investigated. Research, conducted with the use of oxidases, esterases and glutathione transferases blockers, showed that all three enzymes groups are involved in the pollen beetle resistance mechanisms to deltamethrin. The main role was played by oxidases and to a lower degree: esterases and glutathione transferases, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3atransferases 3aglutathione 3aactive ingredients 3aBrassicogethes aeneus 3apyrethrins 3aresistance mechanisms 3apests 3adeltamethrin 3acyfluthrin 3aesterases 3aPoland 0aresistance 0apollen beetle 0apyrethroids 0aMeligethes aeneus 0asynergists1 aWęgorek, Paweł1 aMrówczyński, Marek0 tJournal of plant protection research.g2013 Mar. 27, v. 53, no. 1 p.89-95dVersitax1899-007X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/jppr-2013-00133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02000naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245008100162300001600243520101100259592002801270650001501298650002201313650001501335650001401350650001201364650001201376650002501388650001601413700001201429700001501441773011401456856008301570852000901653655001201662IND60528100020221117011415.0190417e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052810002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cois.2016.03.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarmel, I10aMating induces developmental changes in the insect female reproductive tract  ap. 106-113.  aIn response to mating, the Drosophila female undergoes a series of rapid molecular, morphological, behavioral and physiological changes. Studies in Drosophila and other organisms have shown that stimuli received during courtship and copulation, sperm, and seminal fluid are needed for the full mating response and thus reproductive success. Very little is known, however, about how females respond to these male-derived stimuli/factors at the molecular level. More specifically, it is unclear what mechanisms regulate and mediate the mating response, how the signals received during mating are integrated and processed, and what network of molecules are essential for a successful mating response. Moreover, it is yet to be determined whether the rapid transition of the reproductive tract induced by mating is a general phenomenon in insects. This review highlights current knowledge and advances on the developmental switch that rapidly transitions the female from the ‘unmated’ to ‘mated’ state.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDrosophila 3achemical elements 3acopulation 3acourtship 3afemales 3ainsects 3areproductive success 3aspermatozoa1 aTram, U1 aHeifetz, Y0 tCurrent opinion in insect science.g2016 Feb., v. 13 p.106-113dElsevier Inc.wJournal:23301x2214-57457nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cois.2016.03.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03203naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245010900165520162800274592002801902650001601930650001201946650002901958650001101987650001801998650001702016650003702033650002602070650001702096650000902113653001802122653002102140653002702161653003002188700002902218700001402247700001902261700006302280700006102343700006902404700005902473773011802532856008602650852000902736655001202745IND60743771720221122223346.0211213e20211001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074377172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.1131432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYan, Yudi10aPredicting the impact of biochar on the saturated hydraulic conductivity of natural and engineered media  aIf biochar is applied to soil or stormwater treatment media, the saturated hydraulic conductivity (K) may be altered, which is a critical property affecting media performance. While a significant number of studies document biochar's effect on a porous medium's K, predictive models are lacking. Herein models are advanced for predicting K for repacked natural soil and engineered media when amended with biochar of various particle sizes and application rates. Experiments were conducted using three repacked natural soils, two uniform sands, and a bioretention medium amended with a wood biochar sieved to seven different biochar particle size distributions and applied at three rates. Experimental measurements showed a strong positive correlation between the interporosity of each medium and K. Across all media, the classic Kozeny-Carman (K–C) model predicted K and the relative change in K because of biochar amendment for each medium best. For soils alone, a recently developed model based on existing pedotransfer functions was optimal. The K–C model error was improved if the particle specific surface area was increased for large biochar particles, which indicates the importance of biochar particle shape on pore structure and K. X-ray Computed Tomography was coupled with pore network modeling to explain the unexpected decrease in K for sands amended with medium and large biochar. While biochar increased interporosity, mean pore radii decreased by ~25% which reduced K. The X-ray measurements and pore network modeling help to explain anomalous results reported for biochar-amended sands in other studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3abiochar 3aenvironmental management 3amodels 3aparticle size 3aporous media 3asaturated hydraulic conductivity 3astormwater management 3asurface area 3awood 0aInterporosity 0aPredictive model 0aKozeny-carman equation 0aX-ray computed tomography1 aAkbar Nakhli, Seyyed Ali1 aJin, Jing1 aMills, Godfrey1 aWillson, Clinton S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7914-05961 aLegates, David R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4323-44161 aManahiloh, Kalehiwot Nega1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3568-51101 aImhoff, Paul T.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8893-86390 tJournal of environmental management.g2021 Oct. 01, v. 295 p.113143-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.1131433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02576naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005700147245016500204300001400369500001400383520132000397592002801717650001701745650001701762650002101779650002101800650001401821650001701835653001701852653001301869653002101882700002201903700001701925700002101942700002201963773011501985856008102100852000902181655001202190IND60723261720221120051641.0210113e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072326172DNAL7 a10.1017/S00311820200020242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaláž, Ivan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6479-023810aDiversity, distribution and changes in communities of fleas on small mammals along the elevational gradient from the Pannonian Plain to the Carpathian Mountains  ap. 63-73.  aNAL-light  aThe causal chain of parasite–host–environment interactions, the so-called ‘dual parasite environment’, makes studying parasites more complicated than other wild organisms. A sample of 65 282 fleas taken from 336 different locations were analysed for changes in the distribution, diversity and compensation of flea communities found on small mammals along an elevational diversity gradient ranging from the Pannonian Plain to the base of the Carpathian summits. The fleas were divided into four groups, which were derived from changes in abundance and occurrence determined from cluster analysis. They are (1) flea species whose range seems unrelated to any change in elevation; (2) species that avoid high altitudes; (3) a group that can be subdivided into two types: (i) host-specific fleas and (ii) mountains species and (4) species opting for high altitudes on the gradient or preferring lower to middle elevations below 1000 m. Our study showed a unimodal pattern of flea diversity along the elevational gradient. It indicated that seasonality significantly conditions changes in biodiversity and patterns of spatial change along the elevational gradient, with specific flea species influenced by their host, while the impact of environmental conditions is more pronounced in opportunistic flea species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSiphonaptera 3abiodiversity 3acluster analysis 3ahost specificity 3aparasites 3aparasitology 0aEulipotyphla 0aRodentia 0aunimodal pattern1 aŠevčík, Michal1 aTulis, Filip1 aZigová, Martina1 aDudich, Alexander0 tParasitology.g2021 Jan., v. 148, no. 1 p.63-73dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl45572x1469-81617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00311820200020243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04286naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005800151245009900209520197400308592002802282650001102310650005802321650001202379650001902391650002902410650002102439650001602460650002002476651001202496651001102508651001102519651001002530651001002540651002502550651001302575651001302588651001002601653002302611653002502634653003002659653000902689653001102698700005902709700002302768700001802791700006002809700002202869700007002891700002102961700002802982700006703010700006103077700002203138700006203160700002103222700001703243700002203260700002603282700002103308700005803329773011803387856008603505852000903591655001203600IND60743771920221122223336.0211213e20211001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074377192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.1131462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalvia, Monica1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8989-037710aClimate mitigation in the Mediterranean Europe: An assessment of regional and city-level plans  aIn Europe, regions in the Mediterranean area share common characteristics in terms of high sensitivity to climate change impacts. Does this translate into specificities regarding climate action that could arise from these Mediterranean characteristics? This paper sheds light on regional and local climate mitigation actions of the Mediterranean Europe, focusing on the plans to reduce greenhouse gases emissions in a representative sample of 51 regions and 73 cities across 9 Mediterranean countries (Croatia, Cyprus, France, Greece, Italy, Malta, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain). The study investigates: (i) the availability of local and regional mitigation plans, (ii) their goals in term of greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets on the short and medium-long term, and (iii) the impact of transnational climate networks on such local and regional climate mitigation planning. Results of this study indicate an uneven and fragmented planning, that shows a Mediterranean West-East divide, and a link with population size. However, overall, both regional and city action seem insufficiently ambitious with regards to meeting the Paris Agreement, at least at city level. While national frameworks are currently weak in influencing regional and local actions, transnational networks seem to be engaging factors for commitment (at city level) and ambitiousness (at regional level). The uneven and fragmented progress revealed by this study, does not align with the characteristics shared by investigated regions and cities in terms of environmental, socio-political, climatic and economic conditions. The results support the call of a common green deal at the Mediterranean level to further address specific Mediterranean challenges and related needs. This will allow to capitalise on available resources, generate local-specific knowledge, build capacities, and support Mediterranean regions and cities in preparing the next generation of more ambitious mitigation plans.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCyprus 3aUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aenvironmental management 3agreenhouse gases 3agreenhouses 3apopulation size 3aCroatia 3aFrance 3aGreece 3aItaly 3aMalta 3aMediterranean region 3aPortugal 3aSlovenia 3aSpain 0aClimate mitigation 0aMediterranean Europe 0aLocal mitigation planning 0aCity 0aRegion1 aOlazabal, Marta1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3381-06541 aFokaides, Paris A.1 aTardieu, Léa1 aSimoes, Sofia G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4304-14111 aGeneletti, Davide1 aDe Gregorio Hurtado, Sonia1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4654-53861 aViguié, Vincent1 aSpyridaki, Niki-Artemis1 aPietrapertosa, Filomena1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6519-71051 aIoannou, Byron I.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6562-95291 aMatosović, Marko1 aFlamos, Alexandros1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9279-96381 aBalzan, Mario V.1 aFeliu, Efren1 aRižnar, Klavdija1 aŠel, Nataša Belšak1 aHeidrich, Oliver1 aReckien, Diana1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1145-95090 tJournal of environmental management.g2021 Oct. 01, v. 295 p.113146-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.1131463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02367naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001900145245013800164300001600302506002800318520087800346592002801224506003701252650002401289650001401313650001701327650001601344650001201360650001301372650000901385650001801394650002301412650002101435650002301456650001801479650001101497650001201508651001401520653002501534653001801559653001101577653002701588700001701615700001701632773013501649856008001784852000901864655001201873IND60774869320221207084359.0170109e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077486932DNAL7 a10.18343/jipi.21.3.219	2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSetiawati, Mia10aKecernaan pakan dan pertumbuhan ikan patin pangasius hypopthalmus yang diberi tepung dan ekstrak daun kayu manis cinnamomum burmannii  ap. 219-223.  aResource is Open Access  aThis research was conducted to evaluate the digestibility and growth performance of catfish Pangasius hypopthalmus fed on Cinnamomum burmannii leaf powder and extract.

What impact does the olfactory background have on pollination systems and their evolution? We consider recent behavioral studies that address the context of when and where volatile backgrounds influence a pollinator's perception of floral blends. In parallel, we review neurophysiological studies that show the importance of blend composition and background in modifying the representation of floral blends in the pollinator brain, as well as experience-dependent plasticity in increasing the representation of a rewarding odor. Here, we suggest that the efficacy of the floral blend in different environments may be an important selective force shaping differences in pollinator olfactory receptor expression and underlying neural mechanisms that mediate flower visitation and plant reproductive isolation.  aPublisher supplied data 3abrain 3acommunications technology 3aflowers 3ainsects 3aodors 3aolfactory receptors 3aplant communities 3apollination 3apollinators 3areproductive isolation 3asmell 3avegetation1 aBroadhead, Geoffrey T1 aRaguso, Robert A1 aRiffell, Jeffrey A0 tCurrent opinion in insect science.g2016 June, v. 15 p.53-60dElsevier Inc.wJournal:23301x2214-57457nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cois.2016.03.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03109naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245015900157300002000316520152800336592002801864650001901892650001101911650000901922650002801931650001301959650001401972650001901986650001802005650001902023650001902042650001502061650002002076650001702096650001902113650000902132700001802141700001802159700002302177700001902200700001502219700002202234700002702256700002202283700002102305700002202326700002202348773012502370856007502495852000902570655001202579IND60790757520221117022212.0220826e20220816xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079075752DNAL7 a10.1039/d1ra08525e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBahadur, Ali10aConstruction of a binary S-scheme S-g-C₃N₄/Co-ZF heterojunction with enhanced spatial charge separation for sunlight-driven photocatalytic performance  ap. 23263-23273.  aA step-scheme (S-scheme) photocatalyst made of sulfurized graphitic carbon nitride/cobalt doped zinc ferrite (S-g-C₃N₄/Co-ZF) was constructed using a hydrothermal process because the building of S-scheme systems might increase the lifespan of highly reactive charge carriers. Utilizing cutting-edge methods, the hybrid photocatalyst was evaluated by employing TEM, XPS, XRD, BET, FTIR, transient photo-response, UV-vis, EIS and ESR signals. In order to create a variety of binary nanocomposites (NCs), nanoparticles (NPs) of 6% cobalt doped zinc ferrite (Co-ZF) were mixed with S-g-C₃N₄ at various concentrations, ranging from 10 to 80 wt%. For photocatalytic dye removal, a particular binary NC constructed between S-g-C₃N₄ and Co-ZF produces a huge amount of catalytic active sites. The findings showed that loading of S-g-C₃N₄ on 6% Co-ZF NPs serves as a good heterointerface for e⁻/h⁺ separation and transportation through the S-scheme S-g-C₃N₄/Co-ZF heterojunction. By boosting the hybrid system's BET surface area for the photocatalytic process, the addition of 6% Co-ZF improves the system's ability to absorb more sunlight and boosts its photocatalytic activity. The highest photo-removal effectiveness (98%), which is around 2.45 times higher than that of its competitors, was achieved by the hybrid photocatalyst system with an ideal loading of 48% Co-ZF. Furthermore, the trapping studies showed that the primary species involved in the MB aqueous photo-degradation were ˙OH⁻ and h⁺.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon nitride 3acobalt 3adyes 3aferrimagnetic materials 3agraphene 3alongevity 3ananocomposites 3ananoparticles 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3aphotolysis 3asolar radiation 3asurface area 3atransportation 3azinc1 aIqbal, Shahid1 aJaved, Mohsin1 aHassan, Syeda Saba1 aNadeem, Sohail1 aAkbar, Ali1 aAlzhrani, Rami M.1 aAl-Anazy, Murefah Mana1 aElkaeed, Eslam B.1 aAwwad, Nasser S.1 aIbrahium, Hala A.1 aMohyuddin, Ayesha0 tRSC advances.g2022 Aug. 16, v. 12, no. 36 p.23263-23273dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1ra08525e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02380naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092040001800121100002100139245012900160300001800289500001500307520106200322592002801384650002701412650002301439650001201462650004301474650001501517650000801532650001901540650001901559650001001578650002401588650002501612653001501637700002101652700001801673700001701691700001701708700001601725773011701741856007901858852000901937655001201946IND4465708820221118173930.0120419e201111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446570882DNAL7 a10.3732/ajb.11002292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChiang, Yu-Chung10aIsolation of 16 polymorphic microsatellite markers from an endangered and endemic species, Podocarpus nakaii (Podocarpaceae)  ap. e306-e309.  a2019-12-06  aâ¢ Premise of the study: Sixteen polymorphic microsatellite markers were isolated and characterized from the endangered evergreen tree Podocarpus nakaii to evaluate the population structure for conservation efforts. â¢ METHODS: and Results: Based on a modified amplified fragment length polymorphism and magnetic bead enrichment method, 16 polymorphic primer sets were developed for this endangered insular species.

Many streamflow prediction studies have demonstrated the excellent prediction ability of decomposition ensemble models. Several studies first extracted subsignals from a streamflow series and then split subsignals into training and validation sets to build prediction models, capturing some future information not available in practical streamflow forecasting. Alternatively, dividing a time series into training and validation sets first and later decomposing them into subsignals can expose the subsignals to the boundary effect, making predicting streamflow difficult. Furthermore, building one model for each subsignal is laborious and can cause error accumulation. Therefore, establishing a robust and efficient decomposition ensemble model without future information to predict highly nonstationary and nonlinear streamflow is challenging. Hence, a single-model forecasting (SF) scheme that assesses the validation distribution during the training stage to adapt to the boundary effect was designed. A SF scheme based on variational mode decomposition (VMD) and long short-term memory (LSTM), namely, SF-VMD-LSTM, was proposed to predict daily streamflow 1–7 days ahead. Non-decomposition-based and decomposition-ensemble-based LSTM models established using SF, multi-model ensemble forecasting (MEF) and SF with the most influential subsignals (SFMIS) and the ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) and discrete wavelet transform (DWT) were compared. Additionally, multi-model ensemble hindcasting (MEH), single-model hindcasting (SH) and SH with the most influential subsignals (SHMIS) were used as benchmarks to evaluate the forecasting schemes’ adaptability to the boundary effect. Two daily streamflow series from Han River and Jing River, China, were investigated. The results indicate that (1) SF is more robust and efficient than MEF and SFMIS; (2) VMD performs better than EEMD and DWT; (3) SF-VMD-LSTM, with NSE values larger than 0.8 for almost all the prediction scenarios, outperformed other comparative models. Therefore, SF-VMD-LSTM is robust and efficient for forecasting highly nonstationary and nonlinear streamflow.  aPublisher supplied data 3aneural networks 3aprediction 3arivers 3astream flow 3atime series analysis 3awater management 3awavelet 3aChina 0aForecasting experiment 0aHindcasting experiment 0aDecomposition and ensemble 0aDeep learning1 aLuo, Jungang1 aNanac(Cartoonist)1 aLian, Yani1 aHe, Xinxin0 tJournal of hydrology.g2020 June, v. 585 p.124776-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.1247763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03190naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100001700169245008300186300001400269520119700283592002801480650002701508650003001535650001001565650001101575650001501586650001301601650001101614650003001625650002301655650000901678650001301687650003901700650002901739650004001768650003601808650005401844650002101898650003701919650003501956650003201991650003602023650003202059650001102091650004402102650003902146650004402185650002502229650002802254700002202282700002202304700002702326773010702353856008402460990002302544852000902567655001202576IND60097824520221122122515.0141104e20111116xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009782452DNAL7 a219242622pmid7 a10.1016/j.ejphar.2011.08.0382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFiume, Luigi10aEffect of sorafenib on the energy metabolism of hepatocellular carcinoma cells  ap. 39-43.  aRecent data demonstrated that sorafenib impaired the oxidative phosphorylation of a rat myogenic cell line and suggested that this biochemical lesion can contribute to the cardiac toxicity caused by the drug. With the experiments reported here, we verified whether sorafenib inhibits oxidative phosphorylation also in cells from human hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs), which are treated with this drug. By using the HCC cell lines PLC/PRF/5 and SNU-449 we studied the effects of the drug on ATP cellular levels, oxygen consumption and aerobic glycolysis, a metabolic pathway generally used by neoplastic cells to meet their energy demand. The effect of sorafenib on ATP cellular levels was also studied in cells grown in a glucose-free medium, which only derive their energy from oxidative phosphorylation. We found that at clinically relevant concentrations sorafenib hindered oxidative phosphorylation, whereas at the same time stimulated aerobic glycolysis in glucose-grown cells, thus attenuating the cellular ATP depletion. These results support the impairment of oxidative phosphorylation as a mechanism contributing to the antineoplastic activity of sorafenib in the treatment of HCCs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aanticarcinogenic activity 3adrugs 3aenergy 3aglycolysis 3ahepatoma 3ahumans 3aoxidative phosphorylation 3aoxygen consumption 3arats 3atoxicity 2aAdenosine Triphosphatexmetabolism 2aAerobiosisxdrug effects 2aAntineoplastic Agentsxpharmacology 2aBenzenesulfonatesxpharmacology 2aCarcinoma, Hepatocellularxmetabolismxpathology. 2aCell Line, Tumor 2aCell Proliferationxdrug effects 2aCell Respirationxdrug effects 2aCell Survivalxdrug effects 2aEnergy Metabolismxdrug effects 2aGlycosylationxdrug effects 2aHumans 2aLiver Neoplasmsxmetabolismxpathology. 2aNiacinamidexanalogs & derivatives 2aOxidative Phosphorylationxdrug effects 2aPhenylurea Compounds 2aPyridinesxpharmacology1 aManerba, Marcella1 aVettraino, Marina1 aDi Stefano, Giuseppina0 tEuropean journal of pharmacology.g2011 Nov. 16, v. 670, no. 1 p.39-43dElsevier B.V.x0014-29997nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejphar.2011.08.0383Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02050naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004100092040001800133100001300151245015300164300001600317520092100333592002801254650002101282650002601303650001601329650001801345650002201363650001501385650002301400650001601423651001001439651001701449700001601466700001301482773009701495856008701592852000901679655001201688IND4475751320221118022553.0150808e20110124xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447575132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2010.01.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXie, Tao14aThe effects of groundwater table and flood irrigation strategies on soil water and salt dynamics and reed water use in the Yellow River Delta, China  ap. 241-252.  aVegetation management in shallow groundwater table environments requires an understanding of the interactions between the physical and biological factors that determine root-zone soil salinization and moisture. In this study, the effects of groundwater depth and flood irrigation strategies on water and salt dynamics and reed water use were analyzed in the shallow groundwater region of the Yellow River Delta in China using the HYDRUS-1D model. The results indicated that there is a conflict between water, salt stress, and reed water use with variations in groundwater depth. A water table depth of 3.5m is the minimum limit to maintain a safe level of soil salinity, but at this depth, the environmental stress on reeds is worsened by the decrease in soil water storage. Maintaining the flood pulses on the wetland, especially during May, may be critical for restoring the reed wetland in the Yellow River Delta.  aPublisher supplied data 3aflood irrigation 3airrigation management 3asalt stress 3asoil salinity 3asoil salinization 3asoil water 3asoil water storage 3awater table 3aChina 3aYellow River1 aLiu, Xinhui1 aSun, Tao0 tEcological modelling.g2011 Jan. 24, v. 222, no. 2 p.241-252dElsevier B.V.x0304-38007nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2010.01.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03298naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245018500160300001200345520164500357592002802002596009202030596008102122650002802203650002902231650002802260650001502288650002002303650001002323650001802333650002502351650002402376650001302400650002502413650001902438650001002457650000702467650001902474700001702493700001302510700001902523700005102542773014402593856008202737852000902819655001202828IND60613394420221118003003.0181023e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061339442DNAL7 a10.1007/s11274-018-2533-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Ming10aUsing drug-loaded pH-responsive poly(4-vinylpyridine) microspheres as a new strategy for intelligent controlling of Lactobacillus plantarum contamination in bioethanol fermentation  ap. 146.  aBioethanol fermentation is usually contaminated by bacteria, especially lactic acid bacteria (LAB), thereby leading to decrease of bioethanol yield and serious economic losses. Nisin is safer for controlling of bacterial contamination than antibiotics that are widely applied in industry. Moreover, in LAB contaminative bioethanol fermentation system, consistently decreased pH value provides opportunity to realize pH value responsive material-based release of anti-bacteria substances for intelligent and persistent controlling of bacterial contamination. In this study, nisin was embedded into pH-sensitive poly(4-vinylpyridine) (P4VP) microspheres synthesized by suspension polymerization to realize intelligent controlling of Lactobacillus plantarum contamination in bioethanol fermentation. Chloramphenicol with the highest antimicrobial activity and excellent stability was chosen as the model drug to be embedded into P4VP microspheres to test the drug release behavior. The drug release curve of chloramphenicol-loaded P4VP microspheres showed sustained and pH-responsive release properties. The diameters of the microspheres ranged from 40 to 100 µm. The encapsulation efficiency of nisin into P4VP microspheres was 47.67% and the drug-loading capacity of nisin was 2.5%. Nisin-loaded P4VP microspheres were added into the simulated contaminative fermentation system, and successfully reversed the decline of bioethanol yield secondary to L. plantarum contamination. The results in this study indicated that L. plantarum contamination in bioethanol fermentation could be effectively controlled by nisin-loaded P4VP microspheres.  aPublisher supplied data  aXDB14010301cthe Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences  aPY201617cthe Higher Education and High-quality and World-class Universities 3aLactobacillus plantarum 3aantimicrobial properties 3abacterial contamination 3abioethanol 3achloramphenicol 3adrugs 3aencapsulation 3aethanol fermentation 3afinancial economics 3aindustry 3alactic acid bacteria 3amicroparticles 3anisin 3apH 3apolymerization1 aHu, Hong-Wei1 aChen, Ze1 aZhang, Ya-Xian1 aLi, Hao1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4768-38330 tWorld journal of microbiology & biotechnology.g2018 Oct., v. 34, no. 10 p.146-146dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl44995x0959-39937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11274-018-2533-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03051naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132100002100150245012900171300001600300520191300316592002802229650001802257650001402275650001902289650001502308650001102323650001102334650001402345650001502359650001002374650002402384650001702408650001202425650001502437650001202452650001502464773007902479856008602558852000902644655001202653IND4475712820221121222406.0141111e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447571282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.geoderma.2010.12.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWillsford, John,12aA weathering intensity index for the Australian continent using airborne gamma-ray spectrometry and digital terrain analysis  ap. 124-142.  aWeathering intensity largely controls the degree to which primary minerals are altered to secondary components including clay minerals and oxides. As weathering intensity increases there are changes in the hydrological, geochemical and geophysical characteristics of the regolith. Thus, once calibrated, weathering intensity can be used to predict a range of regolith properties. A weathering intensity index (WII) over the Australian continent has been developed at a 100m resolution using regression models based on airborne gamma-ray spectrometry imagery and the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) elevation data. Airborne gamma-ray spectrometry measures the concentration of three radioelements — potassium (K), thorium (Th) and uranium (U) at the Earth's surface. The total gamma-ray flux (dose) is also calculated based on the weighted additions of the three radioelements. Regolith accounts for over 85% of the Australian land area and has a major influence in determining the composition of surface materials and in controlling hydrological and geomorphological processes. The weathering intensity prediction is based on the integration of two regression models. The first uses relief over landscapes with low gamma-ray emissions and the second incorporates radioelement distributions and relief. The application of a stepwise forward multiple regression for the second model generated a weathering intensity index equation of: WII=6.751+−0.851∗K+−1.319∗Relief+2.682∗Th/K+−2.590∗Dose. The WII has been developed for erosional landscapes but also has the potential to inform on deposition processes and materials. The WII correlates well with site based geochemical indices and existing regolith mapping. Interpretation of the WII from regional to local scales and its application in providing more reliable and spatially explicit information on regolith properties are described.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclay minerals 3aemissions 3aimage analysis 3alandscapes 3amodels 3aoxides 3apotassium 3aprediction 3aradar 3aregression analysis 3aspectroscopy 3athorium 3atopography 3auranium 3aweathering0 tGeoderma.g2012 Aug., v. 183-184 p.124-142dElsevier B.V.x0016-70617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2010.12.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02552naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002800144245013100172300002100303520129100324592002801615650001101643650002101654650001401675650001001689650002601699650001801725650001201743650001001755650001701765653002001782653002701802653002401829653002101853653002701874700002401901700001801925773011201943856007802055852000902133655001202142IND60485893220221116144023.0160218e20130919xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048589322DNAL7 a10.2478/jppr-2013-00312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeledyn-Szewczyk, Beata14aThe Morphological Features and Canopy Parameters as Factors Affecting the Competition Between Winter Wheat Varieties and Weeds  ap. 203-Sek1:209.  aThe aim of the study was to determine the relationship between morphological features and canopy parameters of winter wheat varieties and weed infestation. The 2-year-long field experiments were conducted at 3 locations, on 13 varieties of winter wheat cultivated on organic farms. The response of the tested cultivars to weed infestation was similar regardless of the location. The number of weeds did not differ significantly between the wheat varieties and was similar in all locations and years of the study (109-122 plants/m²). The weed dry matter was significantly lower in Chomentowo (38 g/m²) compared to Osiny and Chwałowice (66 and 85 g/ m²). Nateja and Legenda wheat varieties showed the biggest competitiveness against weeds in both years and locations, whereas Alcazar, Boomer and Jenga were characterized as having the least competitive ability. Natula, Kohelia, Batuta and Ostroga wheat varieties showed a different response to weed infestation over the years. The analysis of correlation and cluster analysis showed that wheat dry matter, plant density, and wheat height had the greatest impact on the number and dry matter of weeds. There was no significant correlation between number of tillers per plant and weed infestation parameters measured in the dough stage  aPublisher supplied data 3acanopy 3acluster analysis 3acultivars 3afarms 3afield experimentation 3aplant density 3atillers 3aweeds 3awinter wheat 0acompetitiveness 0amorphological features 0aorganic agriculture 0aweed infestation 0awinter wheat varieties1 aJończyk, Krzysztof1 aBerbeć, Adam0 tJournal of plant protection research.g2013 Sept. 19, v. 53, no. 3 p.203-Sek1:209dVersitax1899-007X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/jppr-2013-00313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02340naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245006300166300001800229520118900247592002801436650001201464650001201476650001301488650001201501650002001513650000901533650001501542650001601557650002301573700002101596700002001617700002001637700002001657700001701677700002501694700001901719773010201738856008101840852000901921655001201930IND60439828120221118053217.0170823e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043982812DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-015-9202-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMercé, Manuel10aImportance of thermal gradient in the bitumen bees genesis  ap. 6586-6600.  aBitumen can be regarded as a complex colloidal suspension. Indeed, the heaviest molecules in bitumen, the asphaltenes, are known to self-associate to form solid particles suspended in a fluid called maltenes. Bitumen is also composed of a crystallizable fraction that partitions between asphaltenes and maltenes. This complex colloidal system exhibits peculiar patterns at their surface called “bees.” By varying the bitumen formulation and also tuning process parameters such as the temperature cooling rate, we demonstrate the role of the various components: asphaltenes, maltenes, and the crystallizable fraction on the bee existence and we evidence that the bee formation results from a complex coupling between different physico-chemical phenomena such as phase separation, crystallization, and buckling. We then propose a mechanism of bee genesis based on the thermal properties of the various fractions and especially on the heat capacity of both asphaltenes and maltenes. We demonstrate that a thermal gradient in the sample is required for the formation of bees and put into evidence the importance of kinetic aspects. We also discuss the bitumen general bulk properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aApoidea 3abitumen 3acolloids 3acooling 3acrystallization 3aheat 3aseparation 3atemperature 3athermal properties1 aSaadaoui, Hassan1 aDole, François1 aBuisson, Lionel1 aBentaleb, Ahmed1 aRuggi, David1 aSchmitt, Véronique,1 aBackov, Rénal0 tJournal of materials science.g2015 Oct., v. 50, no. 20 p.6586-6600dSpringer USx0022-24617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-015-9202-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02979naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100006100141245011000202500001900312520174700331592002802078650001302106650001102119650001002130650001402140650001202154650001302166650002502179650001702204653002302221653001502244653001602259653002802275653001102303700002002314700002102334700002002355773011002375856007502485852000902560655001202569IND60723262020221120112411.0210113e20210113xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072326202DNAL7 a10.1017/jns.2020.582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalvesen, Lorentz1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3639-334X10aDevelopment and evaluation of image-series for portion size estimation in dietary assessment among adults  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPortion size images are advantageous in dietary assessment. The aim of the present study was to develop and validate new culturally specific image-series for portion size estimation to be used in a new Norwegian version of a British web-based dietary assessment tool (myfood24). Twenty-three image-series of different foods, each containing seven portion size images, were created and validated in a group of adults (n 41, 58 % female) aged 19–44 (median 23), out of which 63 % had higher (tertiary) education. The participants compared 46 portions of pre-weighed foods to the portion size images (1886 comparisons in total). Portion size estimations were either classified as correct, adjacent or misclassified. The weight discrepancy in percentage between the chosen and the correct portion size image was also calculated. Mann–Whitney U tests were used to explore if portion size estimation accuracy differed across sample characteristics, or if it depended on how the foods were presented. For thirty-eight of the forty-six presented food items, the participants selected the correct or adjacent portion size image 98 % on average. The remaining eight food items were on average misclassified by 27 % of the participants. Overall, a mean weight discrepancy of 2⋅5 % was observed between the chosen and the correct portion size images. Females estimated portion size more accurately than males (P = 0⋅019). No other significant differences in estimation accuracy were observed. In conclusion, the new image-series performed satisfactorily, except for the image-series depicting bread, caviar spread and marzipan cake, which will be altered. The present study demonstrates the importance of validating portion size estimation tools.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3abreads 3acakes 3aeducation 3afemales 3afish roe 3anutrition assessment 3aportion size 0aDietary assessment 0aValidation 0aMethodology 0aPortion size estimation 0aImages1 aEngeset, Dagrun1 aØverby, Nina C.1 aMedin, Anine C.0 tJournal of nutritional science.g, v. 10 p.e3-dCambridge University PresswJournal:6175x2048-67907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/jns.2020.583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03852naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006000151245009500211520228400306592002802590650002002618650001302638650001002651650001602661650002902677650001102706650001502717650001402732650001402746650001602760650002902776650000902805650001302814653001902827653002202846653002102868653002402889700002302913700002402936700002802960700001902988700005703007700002703064700002403091700001703115773011903132856008603251852000903337655001203346IND60743772220221122223445.0220321e20210915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074377222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.1131492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarcelino, Joana1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3404-500710aFlight altitudes of a soaring bird suggest landfill sites as power line collision hotspots  aAnthropogenic structures are increasingly encroaching wildlife habitats, creating conflicts between humans and animals. Scaling up renewable energy requires new infrastructures such as power lines, that cause high mortality among birds since they act as obstacles to flight and are used for perching and nesting, which can result in collisions or electrocutions. These interactions often endanger wildlife populations and may also result in high financial costs for companies. Flight behaviour plays a crucial role in collision risk, and the study of flight altitudes enables us to understand what drives birds to fly at collision risk altitudes. This allows the identification of high-risk areas, conditions and bird behaviours, and the implementation of mitigation measures by power line companies. In this study, we use boosted random tree modelling to identify drivers of white stork (Ciconia ciconia) flight altitudes and to investigate the factors that lead them to fly at collision risk altitudes. We found that the main drivers of flight altitude for this soaring bird species were time of day, distance to the nearest landfill site and cloud cover density. Bird age, habitat type and season were comparatively less important. Collision risk increases during crepuscular hours near landfill sites, also in days with high cloud cover density and during the breeding season. In recent years, hundreds to thousands of storks congregate daily at landfill sites to take advantage of the predictability and superabundance of anthropogenic food waste. Some of these sites have high density of power lines, becoming collision risk hotspots for storks and other landfill users. Despite being susceptible to collision, our results suggest that white storks can avoid power lines to a certain extent, by changing their flight altitude at ca. 80 m from these structures. This study shows that the implementation of mitigation measures for existing power lines should be prioritized in areas in the vicinity of landfill sites within white stork distribution ranges, and the projection of new lines should avoid those areas. These measures would benefit species vulnerable to mortality due to power line collision, and it would also reduce associated power outages and economic costs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCiconia ciconia 3aaltitude 3abirds 3acloud cover 3aenvironmental management 3aflight 3afood waste 3alandfills 3amortality 3apower lines 3arenewable energy sources 3arisk 3awildlife 0aCollision risk 0aCollision hotspot 0aFlight altitudes 0aMitigation measures1 aMoreira, Francisco1 aFranco, Aldina M.A.1 aSoriano-Redondo, Andrea1 aAcácio, Marta1 aGauld, Jethro1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9266-13721 aRego, Francisco Castro1 aSilva, João Paulo,1 aCatry, Inês0 tJournal of environmental management.g2021 Sept. 15, v. 294 p.113149-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.1131493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02620naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024003600133024004300169040001800212100001900230245018000249300001400429506002800443506003600471506007600507506003100583520085100614592002801465596007001493596004501563506003701608650002701645650002301672650000901695650001001704650001501714650001401729650001001743650001301753650001201766650001101778650001301789650002601802650001101828650002201839773011201861856008301973903002402056961001302080852000902093655001202102IND60528100720221207080220.0190417e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052810072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cois.2016.04.0032chorus7 a10.1016/j.cois.2016.04.0032doi7 a10.1016/j.cois.2016.04.0032chorusOpen  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCoates, Brad S10aBacillus thuringiensis toxin resistance mechanisms among Lepidoptera: progress on genomic approaches to uncover causal mutations in the European corn borer, Ostrinia nubilalis  ap. 70-77.  aResource is Open Access  aElsevier BV License Information  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aTransgenic plants that express Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) crystal (Cry) protein toxins (Bt crops) effectively control feeding by the European corn borer, Ostrinia nubilalis, although documented resistance evolution among a number of species in both the laboratory and field has heightened concerns about the durability of this technology.

The trial protocol mandated that patients be initially randomized among four chemotherapies, and that those who responded poorly be re-randomized to one of the remaining candidate therapies. The primary aim was to compare the DTRs’ overall success rates, with success defined by the occurrence of successful responses in each of two consecutive courses of the patient’s therapy. Of the 150 study participants, 47 did not complete their therapy as per the algorithm. However, 35 of them did so for reasons that precluded further chemotherapy, that is, toxicity and/or progressive disease. Consequently, rather than comparing the overall success rates of the DTRs in the unrealistic event that these patients had remained on their assigned chemotherapies, we conducted an analysis that compared viable switch rules defined by the per-protocol rules but with the additional provision that patients who developed toxicity or progressive disease switch to a non-prespecified therapeutic or palliative strategy. This modification involved consideration of bivariate per-course outcomes encoding both efficacy and toxicity. We used numerical scores elicited from the trial’s principal investigator to quantify the clinical desirability of each bivariate per-course outcome, and defined one endpoint as their average over all courses of treatment. Two other simpler sets of scores as well as log survival time were also used as endpoints. Estimation of each DTR-specific mean score was conducted using inverse probability weighted methods that assumed that missingness in the 12 remaining dropouts was informative but explainable in that it only depended on past recorded data. We conducted additional worst- and best-case analyses to evaluate sensitivity of our findings to extreme departures from the explainable dropout assumption.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aalgorithms 3aclinical trials 3adata analysis 3adropouts 3adrug therapy 3apatients 3aprobability 3aprostatic neoplasms 3atoxicity 0aCausal inference 0aEfficiency 0aInformative dropout 0aInverse probability weighting 0aMarginal structural models 0aOptimal regime 0aSimultaneous confidence intervals1 aRotnitzky, Andrea1 aLin, Xihong1 aMillikan, Randall E.1 aThall, Peter F.0 tJournal of the American Statistical Association.g2012 June 1, v. 107, no. 498 p.493-508dTaylor & Francis Groupx1537-274X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01621459.2011.6414163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01589naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100008100140245011400221300001800335520041000353592002800763650002300791650001600814650001500830650001100845650001700856650002000873650003000893700002000923700001800943700001300961700001900974700001700993773013401010856007401144852000901218655001201227IND60639121220221120053026.0190501e20170620xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063912122DNAL7 a10.1039/c7cc01427a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDingDandan Ding and Weicheng Huang contributed equally to this work., Dandan10aNon-stoichiometric MoO₃₋ₓ quantum dots as a light-harvesting material for interfacial water evaporation  ap. 6744-6747.  aWe herein present oxygen-deficient molybdenum oxide quantum dots (MoO₃₋ₓ QDs), which possess matching-absorption-spectrum to solar light in both visible and near infrared regions, for proof-of-concept of interfacial water evaporation.

An attempt was also made to investigate the same as a function of manganese ion concentration. The phase identification of the samples was confirmed using powder X-ray diffraction technique (PXRD). In all the doped compounds, manganese was found to be stabilized as divalent Mn²⁺ and preferentially occupying the 8-coordinated Sr²⁺ ion site. However, the proportion of manganese ions residing at zirconium sites was enhanced at higher concentrations. The cohesive energies from DFT calculations explained the stability of Mn²⁺ ions at different sites. It was also observed from the density of states (DOS) that the substitution of manganese at strontium sites leads to the generation of shallow defect states, whereas that at zirconium site generates both shallow and deep defect states within the band gap of the material. A change in the host emission due to these defect states with varied concentrations of Mn²⁺ was also observed, which further supported the observed cationic distribution's trend. The decrease in the band gap energy explained the red shift of the emission spectra. PL decay study also suggested the existence of shallow and deep trap states. The intensity of the EPR signal at g ≈ 1.976, due to paramagnetic oxygen vacancies, was found to increase at higher Mn-concentration because of more substitution at Zr⁴⁺ sites. Two additional EPR sextets with g ≈ 1.993 and 2.013 in Mn doped SZO compounds were attributed to lattice and surface bound Mn²⁺ ions, respectively, which disappeared at higher Mn-concentrations, giving a broad signal.  aPublisher supplied data 3adensity functional theory 3aelectron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aenergy 3aions 3amanganese 3aoxygen 3aphotoluminescence 3astrontium 3azirconium1 aGupta, Santosh K.1 aGhosh, P.

In the coaxial CNF/NiO nanocables, a NiO shell of about 20 nm thick is formed by coating with nano-furs outward on the surface of a CNF core of 200 nm in diameter, which is the main factor for providing a three-dimensional (3D) structure. The NiO shells, comprising of abundant inner spaces on the surface of CNF and high conductivity of 1D CNF, are deeply dependent on the enhancement of electrochemical rate capability. Abundant inner spaces in the NiO shell and the interconnected network between nanocables facilitate the mass transfer. The CNF core with the cushioning effect created through the elastic deformation provides electrochemical stability by protecting both radial compression and volume expansion originating from NiO shells radially. The CNF/NiO nanocables deliver a high reversible capacity of 825 mA h g⁻¹ at 200 mA g⁻¹ after 50 charge–discharge cycles without showing obvious decay. The coaxial CNF/NiO nanocables increase not only electrochemical capability but also electrochemical stability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aanodes 3acarbon nanofibers 3acoatings 3aelastic deformation 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrophoresis 3aheat treatment 3alithium batteries 3amass transfer 3anickel oxide1 aLee, Wan-Jin0 tRSC advances.g2015 Mar. 03, v. 5, no. 30 p.23548-23555dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ra15147j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02698naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245012200166300001800288520125700306592002801563650000801591650001901599650003501618650001301653650001001666650001701676650000901693650001801702650001901720650002301739650001801762650001301780650001401793650002101807650001701828650002001845700001801865700001301883700001801896700001601914700001301930700001401943700001601957700002501973773009901998856008602097852000902183655001202192IND60577273420221120150549.0170807e20150721xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057727342DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.5b016802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Jiuxing10aSimple and Rapid Functionalization of Gold Nanorods with Oligonucleotides Using an mPEG-SH/Tween 20-Assisted Approach  ap. 7869-7876.  aDNA conjugated gold nanorods (AuNRs) are widely applied for nanostructure assembly, gene therapy, biosensing, and drug delivery. However, it is still a great challenge to attach thiolated DNA on AuNRs, because the positively charged AuNRs readily aggregate in the presence of negatively charged DNA. This article reports an mPEG-SH/Tween 20-assisted method to load thiolated DNA on AuNRs in 1 h. Tween 20 and mPEG-SH are used to synergistically displace CTAB on the surface of AuNRs by repeated centrifugation and resuspension, and thiolated DNA are attached to AuNRs in the presence of 1 M NaCl, 100 mM MgCl₂, or 100 mM citrate. AuNRs with different sizes and aspect ratios can be functionalized with DNA by this method. The number of DNA loaded on each AuNR can be easily controlled by the concentrations of mPEG-SH and Tween 20 or the ratio between DNA and AuNR. Functionalized AuNRs were used for nanoparticle assembly and cancer cell imaging to confirm that DNA anchored on the surface of AuNRs retains its hybridization and molecular recognition capability. The new method is easy, rapid, and robust for the preparation of DNA functionalized AuNRs for a variety of applications such as cancer therapy, drug delivery, self-assembly, and imaging.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3acentrifugation 3acetyltrimethylammonium bromide 3acitrates 3adrugs 3agene therapy 3agold 3ahybridization 3aimage analysis 3amagnesium chloride 3ananoparticles 3ananorods 3aneoplasms 3aoligonucleotides 3apolysorbates 3asodium chloride1 aZhu, Bingqing1 aZhu, Zhi1 aZhang, Yicong1 aYao, Xiujie1 aTu, Song1 aLiu, Rudi1 aJia, Shasha1 aYang, Chaoyong James0 tLangmuir.g2015 July 21, v. 31, no. 28 p.7869-7876dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.langmuir.5b016803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03225naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001900137245020800156300001600364520143500380592002801815650002401843650001001867650002001877650002101897650002301918650001501941650001001956650001801966650002201984650002102006650001302027650001302040650001902053650001102072650001102083650001802094650001502112651001602127653002602143653001802169653000902187653002902196653001902225653001602244653002302260653001202283653003502295653001502330653001502345653001102360653001502371700002202386700002402408700002102432773009902453856003802552852000902590655001202599IND50066151220221122122044.0130503s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006615122DNAL7 a10.1071/MF121412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQuinn, John M.12aA Bayesian Belief Network approach to evaluating complex effects of irrigation-driven agricultural intensification scenarios on future aquatic environmental and economic values in a New Zealand catchment  ap. 460-474.  aAgricultural intensification often has complex effects on a wide range of environmental and economic values, presenting planners with challenging decisions for optimising sustainable benefits. Bayesian Belief Networks (BBNs) can be used as a decision-support tool for evaluating the influence of development scenarios across a range of values. A BBN was developed to guide decisions on water abstraction and irrigation-driven land use intensification in the Hurunui River catchment, New Zealand. The BBN examines the combined effects of different irrigation water sources and four land development scenarios, with and without a suite of on-farm mitigations, on ground and surface water quality, key socioeconomic values (i.e. farm earnings and jobs, and contribution to regional gross domestic production (GDP)) and aquatic values (i.e. salmon, birds, waterscape, contact recreation, periphyton and invertebrates). It predicts high farm earnings, jobs and regional GDP with 150% increase in irrigated area, but a range of positive and negative aquatic environmental outcomes, depending on the location of water storage dams and the application of a suite of on-farm mitigations. This BBN synthesis of a complex system enhanced the ability to include aquatic values alongside economic and social values in land-use and water resource planning and decision making, and has influenced objective setting in Hurunui planning processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquatic environment 3abirds 3adecision making 3aecological value 3aeconomic valuation 3aemployment 3afarms 3ainvertebrates 3airrigated farming 3airrigation water 3aland use 3aplanning 3arisk reduction 3arivers 3asalmon 3awater quality 3awatersheds 3aNew Zealand 0abathing water quality 0abraided river 0adams 0adiffuse source pollution 0adiscretisation 0agroundwater 0amacroinvertebrates 0anitrate 0aon-farm contaminant mitigation 0aperiphyton 0aphosphorus 0asalmon 0awaterbirds1 aMonaghan, Ross M.1 aBidwell, Vincent J.1 aHarris, Simon R.0 tMarine & freshwater research.g2013, v. 64, no. 5 p.460-474dCSIRO Publishingx1323-16507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/MF12141  aDNAL 7aarticle03823naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003200111040001800143100003400161245011100195300001400306520173600320592002802056650001802084650001802102650001402120650001502134650001902149650002302168650001802191650000902209650002302218650003102241650001602272650001202288650003602300650002702336650002402363650002902387650003302416650002402449650002602473650000902499650000902508650002402517650004002541650002602581650001902607653002202626653002402648653001502672653001702687653000902704700002102713700002302734700002502757700002602782700002102808700002602829700003102855700002202886700001802908773011102926852000903037856007903046655001203125IND4458519320221120205029.0181204e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445851932DNAL7 a213577002pmid7 a10.1258/la.2010.0101112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDe Vleeschauwer, Stéphanie I10aRepeated invasive lung function measurements in intubated mice: an approach for longitudinal lung research  ap. 81-89.  aInvasive lung function measurements are useful tools to describe respiratory disease models in mice but only result in one time-point measurements because of tracheostomy. We explored if intubation may overcome the need for tracheostomy thereby allowing invasive lung function monitoring of individual mice over time. Repeated invasive lung function measurements with Scireq© – FlexiVent or Buxco© – Forced Pulmonary Maneuvers® were performed three times in BALB/c mice with intervals of 10 days. Each lung function assessment following intubation was compared with a similar measurement in age-matched tracheostomized mice, the golden standard in lung function measurements. Tracheostomy and intubation gave similar results for resistance, elastance and compliance of the whole respiratory system as assessed by Flexivent. Likewise, Forced Pulmonary Maneuvers used to measure lung volumes such as total lung capacity, functional residual capacity, forced expiratory volume in 0.1 s and forced vital capacity, resulted in identical outcomes for both airway approaches. No interaction was found between the procedures for any of the pulmonary function variables. The observed changes over time were rather related to animal growth than to repetitive intubation. Eighty percent of the animals survived three consecutive intubations, which were hampered by transient breathing difficulties, weight loss and neutrophilic bronchoalveolar lavage immediately postextubation. Repetitive invasive lung function measurements by intubation are feasible and reproducible in healthy mice and results are comparable to the standard method. This may open new perspectives for longitudinal research in animal models of respiratory diseases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal growth 3aanimal models 3abreathing 3acompliance 3adisease models 3alaboratory animals 3alung function 3amice 3arespiratory system 3arespiratory tract diseases 3aweight loss 2aAnimals 2aBronchoalveolar Lavagexmethods 2aDisease Models, Animal 2aFeasibility Studies 2aForced Expiratory Volume 2aFunctional Residual Capacity 2aIntubationxmethods 2aLungxphysiopathology 2aMale 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred BALB C 2aRespiratory Function Testsxmethods 2aTracheostomyxmethods 2aVital Capacity 0aForced manoeuvres 0aforced oscillations 0aintubation 0atracheostomy 0amice1 aRinaldi, Manuela1 aDe Vooght, Vanessa1 aVanoirbeek, Jeroen A1 aVanaudenaerde, Bart M1 aVerbeken, Erik K1 aDecramer, M.q(Marc),1 aGayan-Ramirez, Ghislaine N1 aVerleden, Geert M1 aJanssens, Wim0 tLaboratory animals.g2011 Apr., v. 45, no. 2 p.81-89dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl45492x1758-11177nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1258/la.2010.0101113Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02521naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002800150245012700178300001800305520106300323592002801386650001501414650001401429650002201443650001201465650002101477650002101498650002201519650002601541650002101567650001301588650001301601650002101614650001601635650001701651653002601668653003701694653002101731700002001752700001801772700002101790700001601811773013101827856008401958852000902042655001202051IND60122330420221120081612.0150325e20140617xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012233042DNAL7 a10.1080/00103624.2014.9055892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBertáné Szabó, Emese10aAssessment of Environmentally Harmful Nitrogen Surplus by 0.01 M Calcium Chloride Soil Extractant in Long-Term Experiments  ap. 1453-1463.  aCalcium chloride–extractable (1:10 soil/solution ratio, w/v) nitrate nitrogen (NO ₃-N), ammonium nitrogen (NH ₄-N), organic nitrogen (EON), and N ₜₒₜₐₗ fractions were measured in two long-term experiments. Both experiments are located in the Great Hungarian Plain. The first experiment was established on a Luvic Phaeozem soil and the second experiment was on a Calcic Chernozem soil. Researchers investigated the effects of long-term fertilization and irrigation on the amounts of nitrogen (N) fractions. Nitrogen rates caused significant increase in NO ₃-N and N ₜₒₜₐₗ fractions. These fractions were in close correlation (r = 0.87; r = 0.88) with nitrogen balance. The nitrate content of the 200-cm-deep soil layer of soils under different nitrogen- and water-supply conditions were also studied. As an effect of N overfertilization, the maximum nitrate accumulation on nonirrigated plots occurred in the 200-cm depth, whereas on irrigated plots a nitrate accumulation layer could not be observed in the 200-cm-deep soil layer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChernozems 3aPhaeozems 3aammonium nitrogen 3acalcium 3acalcium chloride 3airrigation rates 3along term effects 3along term experiments 3anitrate nitrogen 3anitrates 3anitrogen 3anitrogen balance 3aresearchers 3awater supply 0aLong-term experiments 0a0.01 M CaCl2 extractable N forms 0anitrate leaching1 aGyőri, Zoltán1 aKremper, Rita1 aZsigrai, György1 aLoch, Jakab0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g2014 June 17, v. 45, no. 11 p.1453-1463dTaylor & Francisx1532-24167nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00103624.2014.9055893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02823naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245012400170520105300294592002801347650002401375650001701399650001201416650001001428650002001438650002001458650001901478650001701497650001201514650000901526650001701535650001901552650001501571650000701586650001301593653003401606653003401640653003401674653004101708653004201749653004001791653004301831653002001874653002001894653001601914653001801930653001501948700002201963700002001985700001602005700002802021773010002049856008702149852000902236655001202245IND60779809320221120063113.0220719e20221115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077980932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2022.1334202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmal Nath, V.10aCo-electrospun-electrosprayed ethyl cellulose-gelatin nanocomposite pH-sensitive membrane for food quality applications  aAnthocyanin from red cabbage is an important biomolecule suitable for pH sensing due to its oxidoreduction potential that leads to a color change at various pH conditions. The pH-sensitive anthocyanin compound was extracted from red cabbage (1785 ± 235 mg/L) and encapsulated with gelatin as the wall material at the nanoscale (350 nm) through electrospraying. By using a simultaneous electrospraying and spinning process at 20 kV, nanoencapsulated anthocyanin was immobilized on ethyl cellulose (EC) nanofibers and formed as a nanocomposite membrane. The surface morphology of developed nanocomposites has shown complex nonwoven nanofiber formation and the immobilized nano encapsulates captured inside the nanofibrous membrane. The pH sensitivity was significantly stable up to 7 days of storage at room temperature. Total color difference has been observed to be statistically significant at different pH conditions of 2 to 12. Also, the application of the nanocomposite strips in pH sensing during milk spoilage was studied and reported.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3aanthocyanins 3acabbage 3acolor 3aelectrospraying 3aethyl cellulose 3afood chemistry 3afood quality 3agelatin 3amilk 3ananocapsules 3ananocomposites 3ananofibers 3apH 3aspoilage 0aAcetic acid, PubChem CID: 176 0aChloroform, PubChem CID: 6212 0aLactic acid, PubChem CID: 612 0aSodium hydroxide, PubChem CID: 14798 0aPotassium chloride, PubChem CID: 4873 0aSodium acetate, PubChem CID: 517045 0aEthyl cellulose, PubChem CID: 24832091 0aElectrospinning 0aElectrospraying 0aAnthocyanin 0aMilk spoilage 0apH sensing1 aVijayakumar, Raja1 aLeena, M.

The method was conceived using the logs in the Swedish Pine Stem Bank as a foundation, and was based on a few predictor features extracted from these logs; namely whorl volume, distance between whorls and distance between pith and surface. These features were not measured in images but calculated from existing parameterised knots. Simulated test sawing shows that the reconstruction method results in a representative model of the knot structure in the log, when considering the grade distribution of the sawn timber produced by the simulation program. The results of this study could, for instance, be used for improved online quality predictions at sawmills. One step in this direction is to use industrial X-ray data to enlarge the amount of log data available for sawing simulation research. Future work can, therefore, focus on developing a practical application of the results presented here.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus sylvestris 3aX-radiation 3aknots 3amodels 3apith 3aprediction 3asawing 3asawmills 3ascanners 0aKnot models 0aknots 0aPinus sylvestris 0awood quality 0aX-ray0 tScandinavian journal of forest research.g2012 July 1, v. 27, no. 5 p.481-491dTaylor & Francis Groupx1651-18917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02827581.2012.656142  aDNAL 7aarticle
