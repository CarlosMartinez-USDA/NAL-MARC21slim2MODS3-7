  1 aRomero, P.10aEffects of regulated deficit irrigation during the pre-harvest period on gas exchange, leaf development and crop yield of mature almond trees  ap. 303-312.  a2019-12-04  aWe investigated the effects of regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) during the pre-harvest period (kernel-filling stage) on water relations, leaf development and crop yield in mature almond (Prunus dulcis (Mill.) D.A. Webb cv. Cartagenera) trees during a 2-year field experiment. Trees were either irrigated at full-crop evapotranspiration (ET(c) = 100%) (well-irrigated control treatment) or subjected to an RDI treatment that consisted of full irrigation for the full season, except from early June to early August (kernel-filling stage), when 20% ET(c) was applied. The severity of water stress was characterized by measurements of soil water content, predawn leaf water potential (psi(pd)) and relative water content (RWC). Stomatal conductance (g(s)), net CO2 assimilation rate (A), transpiration rate (E), leaf abscission, leaf expansion rate and crop yield were also measured. In both years, psi(pd) and RWC of well-irrigated trees were maintained above -1.0 MPa and 92%, respectively, whereas the corresponding values for trees in the RDI treatment were -2.37 MPa and 82%. Long-term water stress led to a progressive decline in g(s), A and E, with significant reductions after 21 days in the RDI treatment. At the time of maximum stress (48 days after commencement of RDI), A, g(s) and E were 64, 67 and 56% lower than control values, respectively. High correlations between A, E and g(s) were observed. Plant water status recovered within 15 days after the resumption of irrigation and was associated with recovery of soil water content. A relatively rapid and complete recovery of A and g(s) was also observed, although the recovery was slower than for psi(pd) and RWC. Severe water stress during the kernel-filling stage resulted in premature defoliation (caused by increased leaf abscission) and a reduction in leaf growth rate, which decreased tree leaf area. Although kernel yield was correlated with leaf water potential, RDI caused a nonsignificant 7% reduction in kernel yield and had no effect on kernel size. The RDI treatment also improved water-use efficiency because about 30% less irrigation water was applied in the RDI treatment than in the control treatment. We conclude that high-cropping almonds can be successfully grown in semiarid regions in an RDI regime provided that psi(pd) is maintained above a threshold value of -2 MPa. 3afilling period 3agas exchange 3acrop yield 3aseasonal variation 3astomatal conductance 3awater stress 3aalmonds 3aphotosynthesis 3aleaf development 3aleaves 3aplant growth 3asoil water content 3anet assimilation rate 3aleaf water potential 3adeficit irrigation 3aleaf abscission 3aPrunus dulcis 3astress tolerance 3aevapotranspiration 3awater use efficiency 3asemiarid zones 3anut trees 2aAgriculture 2aNutsxphysiology 2aPlant Leavesxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aPlant Transpirationxphysiology 2aPrunusxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aTreesxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aWater 3aSpain 0atranspiration 0acrop production1 aNavarro, J.M.1 aGarcia, F.1 aBotia Ordaz, P.0 tTree physiology.g2004 Mar., v. 24, no. 3 p.303-312x0829-318X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/treephys/24.3.3033Available from publisher's Web site  aINDdMKSe2004/05/20  aNon-US 7aarticle02093naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100002300127245010900150300001600259500001500275520088700290650001301177650002701190650001201217650000901229650001401238650001901252650001901271650002201290650001201312650002501324650002001349653002801369653001301397700002201410773007001432852000901502856009101511930003301602945002501635946001101660655001201671IND4430292720221117203515.0091223e200704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443029272DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

We used 24 microsatellite markers were employed to analyze the diversity and differentiation of the four strains (NG1-4) of the Nagoya breed established at the Aichi-ken Agricultural Research Center. The proportion of polymorphic loci (P(poly)) was 0.83. The mean number of alleles per locus ranged from 2.583 to 3.125. The mean expected heterozygosity ranged from 0.341 to 0.395. The index of random mating (F(is)) per population ranged from 0.054 to 0.158. Significant population differentiation was detected among all strain pairs. These data suggest that the Nagoya breed has low genetic diversity and the four strains are highly differentiated. The genetic information in the current study will contribute to effective breeding and efficient conservation of the Nagoya breed. 3achickens 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aalleles 3aloci 3alandraces 3achicken breeds 3aheterozygosity 3agenetic variation 3astrains 3agenetic polymorphism 3agenetic markers 0amolecular sequence data 0agenotype1 aNakamura, Akihiro0 pJ. poult. scig2007 Apr., v. 44, no. 2 p.135-140x1346-73957nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/browse/jpsa/-char/en/3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100220b20100305c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/01/29  aNon-US 7aarticle02756naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245009100126300001800217500024000235500001500475520118400490650001701674650002201691650001001713650000901723650002001732650001701752650001601769650002401785650001801809650001201827650001301839650001001852653001501862653002401877653001401901653001501915653002601930653001601956653002301972653001401995700001702009700001902026700001602045700001502061773008202076852000902158930003302167945001302200946001302213655001202226IND2180389920221117204007.0981009e199802  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND218038992DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDavis, T.A.10aRoles of insulin and amino acids in the regulation of protein synthesis in the neonate  ap. 347S-350S.  aPaper presented at the 1997 American Society for Nutritional Sciences Symposium Conference on The Roles of Nutrition, Development and Hormone Sensitivity in the Regulation of Protein Metabolism, April 6-9, 1997, New Orleans, Louisiana.  a2019-12-05  aNeonates deposit protein at a very high rate and efficiently utilize dietary amino acids for protein deposition. This high efficiency is associated with an elevated stimulation of tissue protein synthesis by feeding. Our recent studies have focused on identification of the factors that mediate this response in the neonate. A positive curvilinear relationship between skeletal muscle protein synthesis and plasma insulin concentration was identified in fasted and fed suckling pigs; the relationship changes with development. To test the specific effects of insulin on protein metabolism in the neonate, a procedure to clamp amino acids, under hyperinsulinemic conditions, was developed. By using this technique, we showed that insulin-stimulated whole-body amino acid disposal is elevated in the neonate, and this response may account for the efficient use of dietary amino acids for protein accretion. More recent studies suggest that the enhanced stimulation of skeletal muscle protein synthesis by feeding in the neonate is primarily insulin mediated; however, the stimulation of liver protein synthesis by feeding seems to be largely a function of amino acid concentration. 3abody protein 3aprotein synthesis 3aliver 3adiet 3askeletal muscle 3ablood plasma 3aamino acids 3ahormonal regulation 3aanimal models 3ainsulin 3aneonates 3aswine 0aregulation 0aprotein utilization 0anutrition 0adeposition 0abiological techniques 0astimulation 0aprotein metabolism 0aresponses1 aBurrin, D.G.1 aFiorotto, M.L.1 aReeds, P.J.1 aJahoor, F.0 tJournal of nutrition.g1998 Feb., v. 128, no. 2S p.347S-350Sx0022-31667nnas  aDNAL  a19981201b19981208c00000000  aINDdHBI  aOther US 7aarticle02320naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100002100144245013200165300001600297500001500313520107500328650002101403650001801424650001901442650002001461650002001481650002101501650002001522650002401542650001901566653001401585700002001599700002101619700001901640773007001659852000901729856009101738930003301829945002501862946001101887655001201898IND4426963120221117203624.0091009e200907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442696312DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

T4 and T3 were mixed in the basal diet at concentrations of 1.2, 3.6 and 10.8mg/kg and 0.3, 0.9 and 2.7mg/kg, respectively. Plasma T4 and T3 concentrations were increased dose-dependently by dietary T4 and T3, respectively, while plasma T3 concentration was not increased by dietary T4. Both T4 and T3 retarded growth and increased feed conversion at the higher dose levels while food intakes were not changed significantly. Relative skeletal muscle weights tended to be increased by T4 and T3 probably because body fat contents were decreased intensely by the treatments as indicated by the decrement of abdominal fat. Both heat production and muscle protein breakdown were increased in a dose-dependent manner by either T4 or T3, and the potency of T4 was about one fourth of that of T3. In conclusion, thyroxine is active and has roles in heat production and skeletal muscle protein breakdown. 3abroiler chickens 3aanimal growth 3amuscle protein 3afeed conversion 3askeletal muscle 3atriiodothyronine 3aheat production 3aprotein degradation 3afood additives 0athyroxine1 aKuroki, Hiroshi1 aKamizono, Tomomi1 aOhtsuka, Akira0 pJ. poult. scig2009 July, v. 46, no. 3 p.212-216x1346-73957nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/browse/jpsa/-char/en/3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100114b20100205c00000000  aINDd8CTe2009/11/11  aNon-US 7aarticle03517naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245008200125300001800207500024000225500001500465520174800480650002402228650002902252650001702281650002202298650002002320650001702340650002702357650001402384650002402398650001602422650002402438650001402462650002402476650002602500650001902526653001602545653002302561653002502584653001602609653001502625653001402640653001502654653002602669653003102695653000902726700001702735700001902752700001802771773008202789852000902871930003302880945001302913946001302926655001202939IND2180391220221117203642.0981009e199802  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND218039122DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBell, A.W.10aNutrition, development, and efficacy of growth modifiers in livestock species  ap. 360S-363S.  aPaper presented at the 1997 American Society for Nutritional Sciences Symposium Conference on The Roles of Nutrition, Development and Hormone Sensitivity in the Regulation of Protein Metabolism, April 6-9, 1997, New Orleans, Louisiana.  a2019-12-05  aSomatotropin (ST) and synthetic beta-adrenergic agonists (beta-AA) are growth-modifying agents that increase the rate and sometimes, the efficiency of protein deposition in lean tissues of livestock species. The ST-induced increase in muscle protein deposition is effected by a relatively modest increase in protein synthetic rate. This is possibly mediated by the endocrine influence of marked increases in circulating IGF (insulin-like growth factor)-I, and other ST-dependent components of the IGF system; mediation by locally expressed IGF-I may also occur. Increased muscle protein accretion in animals treated with beta-AA seems to be directly mediated by binding of the synthetic agonist to muscle beta-1 or beta-2 receptors, leading to increased muscle protein synthesis, possibly accompanied or followed by decreased protein degradation. This response is transient, due to down-regulation of beta-adrenergic receptors. Maximal responses of muscle protein accretion to both ST and beta-AA are attenuated by feeding inadequate levels of total protein or specific, limiting amino acids. For ST, but not beta-AA, this effect in growing pigs is partially offset by increased efficiency of utilization of absorbed amino acids for protein deposition, with predictable consequences for dietary protein and amino acid requirements. Both ST and beta-AA are less efficacious in promoting muscle protein deposition in very young animals. For ST, this is related to postnatal development of the somatotropic axis; a mechanistic explanation for the similar lack of effect of beta-AA is lacking. In both cases, this phenomenon must be considered against the very high inherent capacity and efficiency of lean tissue protein accretion in the neonate. 3amechanism of action 3abeta-adrenergic agonists 3abody protein 3aprotein synthesis 3adietary protein 3asomatotropin 3abiological development 3alivestock 3ahormonal regulation 3aamino acids 3aprotein requirement 3areceptors 3aprotein degradation 3aamino acid metabolism 3alean body mass 0aractopamine 0aliterature reviews 0anutrition physiology 0agrowth rate 0adeposition 0aresponses 0aefficiency 0anutrient requirements 0ainsulin-like growth factor 0adiet1 aBauman, D.E.1 aBeermann, D.H.1 aHarrell, R.J.0 tJournal of nutrition.g1998 Feb., v. 128, no. 2S p.360S-363Sx0022-31667nnas  aDNAL  a19981201b19981208c00000000  aINDdHBI  aOther US 7aarticle02620naa a2200541 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100002600133245010400159300001300263300002500276520102100301650002901322650001101351650002001362650001001382650003101392650004101423650003001464650002701494650002601521650001101547650001101558650004001569650003201609650000901641650001601650650003601666650002701702650002201729650002601751650000901777650001201786650002501798653002001823653001501843700002301858700002301881773009901904852000902003939003302012945000802045946001302053655001202066991618938250742620221117203747.0811006e198107  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI810017712DNAL7 a67871032pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOlendzki, Margaret C.10aEvaluating nutrition intervention in atherosclerosis: Some theoretical and practical considerations  ap. 9-16.  ap. 9-16. ill., form.  aThe effects of nutrition intervention on the risk factors associated with atherosclerosis were used to develop a model for investigating such effects. Intervention included dietary assessment, nutrition and health education, and nutrition counselling. The dependent variables selected were serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels, blood pressure, blood sugar, smoking, and exercise habits. Independent variables included age, sex, other risk factors present, medication, etc. The methodology tested was the use of retrospective clinical records from a neighborhood health center administered by Mass. General Hospital. The results revealed that a review of clinical records may be helpful in assessing the impact of nutrition intervention by a nutrition department and its staff; however, some parameters must be observed: standardization of the nutrition intake interview, control of interval between repeat measurements, observation of patients for as long as possible, and precision in recording variables.

  1 aCasella, E.12aA method for describing the canopy architecture of coppice poplar with allometric relationships  ap. 1153-1170.  a2019-12-04  aA multi-scale biometric methodology for describing the architecture of fast-growing short-rotation woody crops is used to describe 2-year-old poplar clones during the second rotation. To allow for expressions of genetic variability observed within this species (i.e., growth potential, leaf morphology, coppice and canopy structure), the method has been applied to two clones: Ghoy (Gho) (Populus deltoides Bartr. ex Marsh. x Populus nigra L.) and Trichobel (Tri) (Populus trichocarpa Torr. & A. Gray x Populus trichocarpa). The method operates at the stool level and describes the plant as a collection of components (shoots and branches) described as a collection of metameric elements, themselves defined as a collection of elementary units (internode, petiole, leaf blade). Branching and connection between the plant units (i.e., plant topology) and their spatial location, orientation, size and shape (i.e., plant geometry) describe the plant architecture. The methodology has been used to describe the plant architecture of 15 selected stools per clone over a 5-month period. On individual stools, shoots have been selected from three classes (small, medium and large) spanning the diameter distribution range. Using a multi-scale approach, empirical allometric relationships were used to parameterize elementary units of the plant, topological relationships and geometry (e.g., distribution of shoot diameters on stool, shoot attributes from shoot diameter). The empirical functions form the basis of the 3-D Coppice Poplar Canopy Architecture model (3-D CPCA), which recreates the architecture and canopy structure of fast-growing coppice crops at the plot scale. Model outputs are assessed through visual and quantitative comparisons between actual photographs of the coppice canopy and simulated images. Overall, results indicate a good predictive ability of the 3-D CPCA model. 3amathematical models 3ahybrids 3aforest trees 3aplant architecture 3acoppicing 3aallometry 3aPopulus deltoides 3aequations 3aclones 3aPopulus trichocarpa 3agenetic variation 3aoverstory 3aPopulus nigra 2aImaging, Three-Dimensional 2aModels, Biological 2aPopulusxanatomy & histologyxphysiology. 2aTreesxanatomy & histologyxphysiology. 3aOregon 3aIowa 3aOntario 3aBelgium 3aUnited Kingdom 0aWashington 0a3-D Coppice Poplar Canopy Architecture model 0aPopulus balsamifera subsp. trichocarpa1 aSinoquet, H.0 tTree physiology.g2003 Dec., v. 23, no. 17 p.1153-1170x0829-318X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/treephys/23.17.11533Available from publisher's Web site  aINDdMKSe2004/05/05  aNon-US 7aarticle02052naa a2200457 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100002700133245010800160300001400268300002200282520066800304650001500972650002900987650001801016650002701034650003301061650001801094650002001112650002501132650002101157650002801178650003301206650001601239653002001255653002701275653002601302653002601328653002201354700002101376700002201397773010001419852000901519939003301528945000801561946001301569655001201582991618937390742620221117203444.0810929e198107  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI810017742DNAL7 a72406042pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStone, Pamela Kendall.10aDietitians in the early establishment stage of their careers: I.

In contrast to animals and fungi, plants contain numerous Su(var)3-9 homologues (SUVH), the members of which form a discrete subfamily. The SU(VAR)3-9 and SUVH proteins associate with heterochromatin and possess histone methyltransferase activity, indicating that they participate in the organization of transcriptionally repressive chromatin. The Arabidopsis thaliana genome contains 10 SUVH genes, belonging to four phylogenetically distinct subgroups: SUVH1, SUVH2, SUVH4, and SUVH5. The structure and expression of SUVH3, a member of the SUVH1 subgroup was investigated. SUVH3 was shown to be broadly expressed during plant development with the highest levels found in proliferating cells. The encoded protein localized in subnuclear foci and remained associated with condensed chromosomes throughout mitosis. A deletion analysis of the SUVH3 upstream region further revealed that an intron located in the 5' UTR is a key regulator of strong and constitutive SUVH3 expression. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3asequence analysis 3atranscription (genetics) 3agene expression 3aamino acid sequences 3aheterochromatin 3amultigene family 3agene expression regulation 3amethyltransferases 3aintrons 2aArabidopsisxanatomy & histologyxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aBase Sequence 2aCell Division 2aCell Nucleusxmetabolism 2aCell Proliferation 2aChromosomesxmetabolism 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGlucuronidasexanalysis 2aHistone-Lysine N-Methyltransferasexchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aInterphase 2aIntronsxphysiology 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPlants, Genetically Modifiedxanatomy & histologyxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aPromoter Regions, Genetic. 0ahistone methyltransferase 0agenome 0amolecular sequence data 0agenes1 aLao, Nga T.1 aKavanagh, Tony A.0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2006 Sept., v. 57, no. 12 p.3301-3311x0022-09577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/erl0933Available from publisher's Web site  a20070307b20070402c00000000  aINDd2CTe2007/02/02  aNon-US 7aarticle03636naa a2200733 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139072001700157072001700174100001800191245008100209300001800290500006400308500001500372520124800387650002501635650002601660650001401686650001801700650002201718650001201740650001401752650002601766650001401792650001401806650002501820650001201845650003101857650002101888650001201909650006101921650006001982650005702042650003802099650002002137650001302157650004502170650002002215650004102235650003102276650006002307650008102367653002502448653002302473653001002496653002202506653002802528653002202556653002202578700001302600700001702613700001302630773009102643852000902734856007802743930003302821945002502854946001102879655001202890IND4384632520221117203732.0061022e200610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438463252DNAL7 a169400392pmid7 a10.1093/jxb/erl0732doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aMarquardt, S.10aAdditional targets of the Arabidopsis autonomous pathway members, FCA and FY  ap. 3379-3386.  aIn the special issue: Special themes in flowering research.  a2019-12-04  aA central player in the Arabidopsis floral transition is the floral repressor FLC, the MADS-box transcriptional regulator that inhibits the activity of genes required to switch the meristem from vegetative to floral development. One of the many pathways that regulate FLC expression is the autonomous promotion pathway composed of FCA, FY, FLD, FPA, FVE, LD, and FLK. Rather than a hierarchical set of activities the autonomous promotion pathway comprises sub-pathways of genes with different biochemical functions that all share FLC as a target. One sub-pathway involves FCA and FY, which interact to regulate RNA processing of FLC. Several of the identified components (FY, FVE, and FLD) are homologous to yeast and mammalian proteins with rather generic roles in gene regulation. So why do mutations in these genes specifically show a late-flowering phenotype in Arabidopsis? One reason, found during the analysis of fy alleles, is that the mutant alleles identified in flowering screens can be hypomorphic, they still have partial function. A broader role for the autonomous promotion pathway is supported by a microarray analysis which has identified genes mis-regulated in fca mutants, and whose expression is also altered in fy mutants. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3atranscription factors 3aflowering 3amessenger RNA 3aprotein synthesis 3aalleles 3aphenotype 3amicroarray technology 3ameristems 3aphenology 3abiochemical pathways 3amutants 3agene expression regulation 3apromoter regions 2aAlleles 2aArabidopsisxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aFlowersxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aModels, Genetic 2aMutation 2aOligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis. 2aPolyadenylation 2aRNA Processing, Post-Transcriptional 2aRNA, Messengerxmetabolism 2aRNA-Binding Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolismxphysiology. 2amRNA Cleavage and Polyadenylation Factorsxgeneticsxmetabolismxphysiology. 0adevelopmental stages 0aliterature reviews 0agenes 0aflowering locus C 0amolecular sequence data 0aplant development 0afloral transition1 aBoss, PK1 aHadfield, J.1 aDean, C.0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2006 Oct., v. 57, no. 13 p.3379-3386x0022-09577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/erl0733Available from publisher's Web site  a20070307b20070402c00000000  aINDd2CTe2007/02/05  aNon-US 7aarticle02553naa a2200469 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100002900133245006700162300001400229300002200243520116400265650001801429650002901447650002701476650002701503650004101530650001601571650001801587650002501605650001501630650002901645650002101674650003601695650002901731650001701760651001801777653001901795653003001814653001901844700001901863700002601882773010001908852000902008939003302017945000802050946001302058655001202071991618935770742620221117203701.0810929e198107  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI810017762DNAL7 a72406062pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmiciklas-Wright, Helen.10aPost-baccalaureate activities of community nutrition graduates  ap. 44-50.  ap. 44-50. charts.  aInformation on post-graduate activities was solicited from 478 graduates of 3 types of programs--community nutrition (CN), coordinated programs in community or general dietetics (CUP), and general nutrition with course work or practicum experience in community nutrition (GDFN). A questionnaire was used to gather the information on employment, graduate study, internship and reasons for pursuing such activities; on assessment by respondents of their undergraduate programs; and on the respondents' perceptions of educational needs and job opportunities in the field of nutrition and dietetics. Most of the 365 respondents were recent graduates; 53.8% entered employment or further study within 2 months of graduation; the majority of respondents obtained first employment related to undergraduate training, whereas fewer than half were employed in nutrition or dietetics at the time of the study. Issues raised by analysis of respondents' profiles included relevance of qualifications to employment, lack of affiliation with professional organizations, dissatisfaction with training, and scarcity of entry-level positions in community nutrition fields.

  1 aSzczerba, Mark W.14aThe face value of ion fluxes: the challenge of determining influx in the low-affinity transport range  ap. 3293-3300.  aThe existence of distinct high- and low-affinity transport systems (HATS and LATS) is well established for major nutrient ions. However, influx mediated by these systems is usually estimated using uniformly simple tracer protocols. Two ⁴²K radiotracer methods to measure potassium influxes in the HATS and LATS ranges in intact barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) roots are compared here: a direct influx (DI) method, and an integrated flux analysis (IFA), which is designed to account for tracer efflux from labelled roots and differential tracer accumulation along the plant axis. Methods showed only minor discrepancies for influx values in the HATS range, but large discrepancies in the LATS range, revealing striking distinctions in the cellular exchange properties dominated by the operation of the two transport systems. It is shown that accepted DI protocols are associated with very large errors in the high-conductance LATS range, underestimating influx at least 6-fold due to four characteristics of this transport mode: (i) accelerated cellular ⁴²K exchange; (ii) a greatly increased ratio of efflux to influx; (iii) increased ⁴²K loss during the removal of water from roots in preweighing centrifugation or blotting protocols; and (iv) increased ⁴²K retention at the root-shoot interface, a region of the plant frequently disregarded in DI determinations. The findings warrant a re-evaluation of a large body of literature reporting influx in the LATS range, and are of fundamental importance to ion flux experimentation in plant physiology. 3aHordeum vulgare 3abarley 3aion transport 3aroots 3apotassium 3aradionuclides 3auptake mechanisms 3astems 3amathematical models 3aexperimental design 3aaccuracy 2aBotanyxmethods 2aHordeumxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aIon Transport 2aMembrane Transport Proteinsxanalysis 2aPlant Rootsxchemistry 2aPotassium Radioisotopes 2aRadioactive Tracers 2aSeedlingsxchemistry. 0ahigh-affinity ion transporters 0alow-affinity ion transporters1 aBritto, Dev T.1 aKronzucker, Herbert J.0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2006 Sept., v. 57, no. 12 p.3293-3300x0022-09577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/erl0883Available from publisher's Web site  a20070307b20070402c00000000  aINDd2CTe2007/02/02  aNon-US 7aarticle02994naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002600150245008900176300001800265520187000283650002402153650000802177650002102185650000902206650001602215650001602231650004302247650001702290651001702307700002002324700001902344700001602363700001902379773017402398856005102572852000902623655001202632IND60408782520221117204002.0150923s2014    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6040878252DNAL7 a10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-14-2472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTrokhymchuk, Anatoliy10aPrevalence and Diversity of Campylobacter Species in Saskatchewan Retail Ground Beef  ap. 2106-2110.  aThe primary objective of this study was to investigate the prevalence of Campylobacter spp. DNA by PCR in retail ground beef sold in Saskatchewan, Canada, and to identify the presence of individual Campylobacter species (C. coli, C. curvus, C. fetus, C. hyointestinalis, C. jejuni, C. rectus, and C. upsaliensis) using real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR). Secondary objectives were to assess potential differences in the prevalence of Campylobacter between ground beef offered for sale during cold and warm seasons as well as that offered for sale fresh and frozen, to investigate any association between the presence of Campylobacter spp. DNA and E. coli and/or aerobic bacterial counts, and finally to compare the prevalence of Campylobacter spp. DNA in ground beef originating from different production and retail environments. Out of the 309 total samples included in the study, 50 (16.2%) samples tested positive for Campylobacter spp. DNA, while 49 (15.9%) samples were determined positive for up to five individual species. Collectively, these assays determined that 14 (4.5%) samples were positive for C. coli, 11 (3.6%) for C. curvus, 6 (1.9%) for C. fetus, 24 (7.8%) for C. hyointestinalis, 12 (3.9%) for C. jejuni, 6 (1.9%) for C. rectus, and 9 (2.9%) for C. upsaliensis. There were 27 (8.7%) samples that were positive at the genus level that did not test positive for any of the seven Campylobacter species investigated (suggesting an alternate Campylobacter species). Also, 26 (8.4%) samples generated positive results by one of the species-specific qPCR assays, but returned no product in the conventional genus-level assay (suggesting a higher sensitivity for the species-specific qPCR assays). There was no significant association between the presence of Campylobacter spp. in Saskatchewan retail ground beef and any of the investigated risk factors. 3aCampylobacter fetus 3aDNA 3aEscherichia coli 3acold 3aground beef 3aplate count 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arisk factors 3aSaskatchewan1 aWaldner, Cheryl1 aChaban, Bonnie1 aGow, Sheryl1 aHill, Janet E.0 tJournal of food protection.g2014 Dec., v. 77, no. 12 p.2106-2110dInternational Association of Milk, Food, and Environmental Sanitarians.wJournal:2024x0362-028X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-14-247  aDNAL 7aarticle02847naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245012400165300001800289520154700307650001901854650001101873650001601884650001301900650001801913650001801931650002101949650001201970650001001982651001101992651001402003651001002017651001802027651001102045651001802056700002202074700001602096700002202112700001602134700001702150773017402167856005102341852000902392655001202401IND60408782420221117203334.0150923s2014    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6040878242DNAL7 a10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-14-2342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCherry, C.10aKnowledge and Perceived Implementation of Food Safety Risk Analysis Framework in Latin America and the Caribbean Region  ap. 2098-2105.  aRisk analysis is increasingly promoted as a tool to support science-based decisions regarding food safety. An online survey comprising 45 questions was used to gather information on the implementation of food safety risk analysis within the Latin American and Caribbean regions. Professionals working in food safety in academia, government, and private sectors in Latin American and Caribbean countries were contacted by email and surveyed to assess their individual knowledge of risk analysis and perceptions of its implementation in the region. From a total of 279 participants, 97% reported a familiarity with risk analysis concepts; however, fewer than 25% were able to correctly identify its key principles. The reported implementation of risk analysis among the different professional sectors was relatively low (46%). Participants from industries in countries with a long history of trade with the United States and the European Union, such as Mexico, Brazil, and Chile, reported perceptions of a higher degree of risk analysis implementation (56, 50, and 20%, respectively) than those from the rest of the countries, suggesting that commerce may be a driver for achieving higher food safety standards. Disagreement among respondents on the extent of the use of risk analysis in national food safety regulations was common, illustrating a systematic lack of understanding of the current regulatory status of the country. The results of this survey can be used to target further risk analysis training on selected sectors and countries. 3aEuropean Union 3ae-mail 3afood safety 3aindustry 3aprofessionals 3arisk analysis 3asafety standards 3asurveys 3atrade 3aBrazil 3aCaribbean 3aChile 3aLatin America 3aMexico 3aUnited States1 aMohr, A.

Originally from China but named after New Zealand's kiwibird, it came to American shores in the 1950's. When properly handled, it is not easily perishable. Under proper temperature and humidity conditions (31-32 degrees F, 90-95% r.h.) it can be used to tenderize meats or added to a marinade. Kiwifruit mature at room-temperature storage in 2-3 days, or within 24 hours when placed in a plastic bag with an apple, a banana, or a pear (the naturally occurring ethylene oxide gas rippens it). Certain molds can affect the fruit and infected fruits should be discarded to protect the uncontaminated ones. Three recipes are given.

Although more than 50% of food service employees are women, there are very few at the decision-making levels in food service corporations. Associations, however, indicate that women are doing somewhat better in their management structures. Generally, women have yet to reach the top in the hotel industry. Some theories accounting for this state of affairs include: 1) Men don't look for leadership from women; 2) women aren't asking for top positions, i.e., they aren't being assertive; 3) women just aren't available for top management positions; or 4) there is a lack of qualified women. 3afood service workers 3ahotel food service 3awage rates 3afemales 3adecision making 0afood service 0asalaries 0amanagement development 0aadministrative management 0aFood service occupations 0amanagement education0 tInstitutions.g1979 Oct. 15, v. 85, no. 8 p.90-91x0273-55207nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19800724c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle03191naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245007700174300001800251520176900269650001002038650001802048650001102066650002502077650002302102650001402125650001802139650002402157650001402181650001802195650002002213650000902233650001902242650002002261650001902281650002202300650001202322650001802334651001102352700002502363700002602388700003102414700003002445773017402475856005102649852000902700655001202709IND60408783320221117203854.0150923s2014    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6040878332DNAL7 a10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-14-0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaldonado-Siman, E.10aImplementation of Quality Systems by Mexican Exporters of Processed Meat  ap. 2148-2152.  aRequirements of hazard analysis and critical control points (HACCP) are becoming essential for international trade in food commodities as a safety assurance component. This research reports the level of the adoption of ISO 9000 and the HACCP system by Federal Inspection Type (TIF) pork-exporting enterprises. Implementation and operating costs are reported as well as the benefits involved in this food industry process. In Mexico, there are 97 companies classified as TIF enterprises, and 22 are registered as exporters of processed pork with the National Services for Safety and Quality and Animal Health of the Secretariat of Agriculture, Livestock, Rural Development, Fisheries and Food. Surveys were administered to 22 companies, with a 95.2% response rate. Enterprise characteristics were evaluated, as well as their operating activities. Fieldwork consisted of administering structured questionnaires to TIF exporters. All the surveyed enterprises had implemented HACCP, whereas the ISO 9000 regulation was applied in only 30%. Of total production, 75% is exported to 13 countries, and 25% goes to the Mexican market niche. Results indicate that the main factors for adopting HACCP are related to accessibility to international markets, improving quality, and reducing product quality audits by customers. The results also indicated that staff training was the most important issue. Microbiological testing was the highest cost of the operation. The main benefits reported were related to better access to international markets and a considerable reduction in microbial counts.

Resistance among isolates of Salmonella was related to the country of recovery, type of sample, size of layer farms, and isolate serotype. Overall, all (100.0%) of the isolates exhibited resistance to one or more of seven antimicrobial agents tested, and all were susceptible to chloramphenicol. The resistance detected ranged from 11.9% to sulphamethoxazole-trimethoprim (SXT) to 100.0% to erythromycin. The difference was, however, not statistically significant (P = 0.23). Across countries, for types of samples that yielded Salmonella, significant differences in frequency of resistance were detected only to SXT (P = 0.002) in Trinidad and Tobago and to gentamycin (P = 0.027) in St. Lucia. For the three countries, the frequency of resistance to antimicrobial agents was significantly different for ampicillin (P = 0.001) and SXT (P = 0.032). A total of 83 (98.8%) of the 84 isolates exhibited 39 multidrug resistance patterns. Farm size significantly (P = 0.032) affected the frequency of resistance to kanamycin across the countries. Overall, among the 14 serotypes of Salmonella tested, significant (P < 0.05) differences in frequency of resistance were detected to kanamycin, ampicillin, and SXT. Results suggest that the relatively high frequency of resistance to six of the antimicrobial agents (erythromycin, streptomycin, gentamycin, kanamycin, ampicillin, and tetracycline) tested and the multidrug resistance detected may pose prophylactic and therapeutic concerns for chicken layer farms in the three countries studied. 3aSalmonella 3aampicillin 3aantibiotic resistance 3achloramphenicol 3aeggs 3aerythromycin 3afarm size 3afarms 3agentamicin 3akanamycin 3alaying hens 3amultiple drug resistance 3aserotypes 3astreptomycin 3atetracycline 3aCaribbean 3aGrenada 3aSaint Lucia 3aTrinidad and Tobago1 aWebb, Lloyd1 aMusai, Lisa1 aLouison, Bowen1 aJoseph, George1 aStewart-Johnson, Alva1 aSamlal, Sannandan1 aRodrigo, Shelly0 tJournal of food protection.g2014 Dec., v. 77, no. 12 p.2153-2160dInternational Association of Milk, Food, and Environmental Sanitarians.wJournal:2024x0362-028X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-14-162  aDNAL 7aarticle01574naa a2200325 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097245003200115300001400147300002100161520072900182650001700911650001500928650002500943650002100968653002000989653001301009653001501022653002401037653002301061653001901084773007001103852000901173939003301182945000801215946001301223655001201236991618929560742620221117203922.0810309e19800101xx ||||go|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI810006002DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL10aOpening the benefit package  ap. 67-68.  ap. 67-68. chart.  aBenefit packages are becoming a more important part of demands of food service industry personnel; according to a national survey, the most common benefits are medical and disability insurance, and pension plans. It's not surprising, in the hospitality business, that at least 50% of employees receive benefits in the form of discounted food or lodging. The noncommercial segments of the business, such as school, military and prison food service, have a higher percentage of pension plans, which offsets the lower wage rates. Profit sharing is used primarily in food chains. Employee and management education is assuming greater importance as the economy puts pressure on the food service business to become more efficient. 3afood service 3aemployment 3afood service workers 3anational surveys 0afringe benefits 0atraining 0aretirement 0aInservice education 0aInsurance programs 0aProfit sharing0 tInstitutions.g1980 Jan. 1, v. 86, no. 1 p.67-68x0273-55207nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19810309c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle01224naa a2200289 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097245002800115300001400143300002200157520048000179650002300659650001500682650002200697650001700719650001700736650002100753650001500774773007000789852000900859930003300868945000800901946001300909655001200922991618929420742620221117203919.0810309e19800101xx ||||go|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI810006022DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL10aFood trends in the '80s  ap. 91-92.  ap. 91-92. charts.  aAmerica's food preferences, as predicted in a national survey of the food service industry, will shift toward Oriental and Mexican cooking, with more emphasis on "healthy" foods and fish, and less on red meat.

  1 aSamadi10aLysine Requirement of Fast Growing Chickens -- Effects of Age, Sex, Level of Protein Deposition and Dietary Lysine Efficiency  ap. 63-72.  aN-balance studies were carried out to assess the lysine requirement of fast growing chickens (Cobb 500) at different sex and age depending on crude protein deposition and efficiency of dietary lysine utilisation. The experiments were conducted within three age periods (I : 10-25d ; II : 30-45d ; III : 50-65d) and 72 chickens (36 males, 36 females) per age period. Experimental diets with six levels of graded CP content were based on high protein (HP)-soybean meal, wheat gluten and crystalline amino acids (L-Thr, DL-Met, L-Arg) in order to create lysine (4.30g Lys/100gCP) as the first limiting dietary amino acid (constant ratio Lys : Met+Cys : Thr : Arg=1 : 1.01 : 0.91 : 1.14). For application of a nonlinear N-utilization model, nitrogen maintenance requirement (NMR) and theoretical maximum for daily nitrogen retention (NR(max)T) were established as model parameters for further assessment of the lysine requirement depending on age, sex and daily CP-deposition. As an example, the calculated lysine requirement concentration for 60% of the theoretical potential for daily CP-deposition (10-25d : 1.10% lysine, 60g daily feed intake ; 30-45d : 1.03% lysine, 140g daily feed intake ; 50-65d : 0.96% lysine, 170g daily feed intake) was in close agreement with published data. However, the predicted feed intake is one of the most important factors of influence when amino acid requirement concentrations are established. The level of daily CP-deposition and the dietary amino acid efficiency as important factors influencing the amino acid requirement data need more attention in future requirement studies. 3abroiler chickens 3aanimal growth 3alysine 3anutrient requirements 3aessential amino acids 3aanimal age 3agender differences 3aprotein deposition 3anutrient use efficiency 3acrude protein 3anitrogen 3amales 3afemales 3anutrient balance 3asoybean meal 3awheat gluten 3anutrient retention 3afeed intake1 aLiebert, Frank0 pJ. poult. scig2007 Jan., v. 44, no. 1 p.63-72x1346-73957nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/browse/jpsa/-char/en/3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090408b20090508c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/03/15  aNon-US 7aarticle03521naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100001900161245020600180300001400386520200800400650001602408650002002424650002002444650001302464650001502477650002102492650001702513650002002530650001802550650002502568650001002593650001602603650001602619650002002635650001602655650001802671700003302689700001602722700001702738700002302755773006802778852000902846856009102855930003302946945002502979946001103004655001203015IND4416436120221117204242.0090217e200701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441643612DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Dietary treatments consisted of an arrangement of three diets that contained 14% crude protein (CP) and 2550kcal metabolizable energy (ME)/kg (low nutrient density ; LND), 15% CP and 2750kcal ME/kg (moderate nutrient density ; MND) and 16% CP and 2950kcal ME/kg (high nutrient density ; HND). The contents of CP, ME and calcium (Ca) in MND diet were fitted with the requirements calculated in this experiment based on five nutrient specifications in the world. All diets were formulated using locally available conventional feedstuffs and un-conventional feed ingredients employing a free software of computer program for least-cost feed formulation. The responses of grower birds to different diets showed that the highest body weight and live weight gain were achieved by the birds that received HND diet that differed significantly from those of LND diet (p<0.05). Uniformity, defined in this study, at 20 weeks of age was significantly highest in birds reared on HND than those of LND and MND groups (p<0.01). During the pre-layer period, the birds of LND diet group consumed the highest amount of feed that differed significantly from other dietary groups (p<0.01). Uniformity at 22 weeks of age in all groups improved but it was still higher in MND and HND diet groups. It may be concluded that it is possible to formulate least-cost poultry diets by incorporating locally available feed ingredients and the responses of birds to HND is most favorable and therefore its nutrient specifications may be followed for formulating diets of semi-scavenging F1 crossbred (Rhode Island Red malexFayoumi female) grower and pre-layer chickens. 3alaying hens 3anutrient intake 3apoultry feeding 3aforaging 3acrossbreds 3anutrient density 3afeed rations 3apoultry housing 3acrude protein 3ametabolizable energy 3afeeds 3aingredients 3abody weight 3aliveweight gain 3afeed intake 3acost analysis1 aChowdhury, Sachchidananda D.1 aAli, Md.

Training and productivity seem to be the keys to strength in the food service industry; most respondents feel that eating out will continue to be a popular national pastime. 3anutrition information 3anational surveys 3arestaurants 3aeating out 3afood chain 3aprediction 0aEconomic influences 0afood service 0aGovernment role 0agrowth0 tInstitutions.g1980 Jan. 1, v. 86, no. 1 p.77-79x0273-55207nnas  aDNAL  a20060204b00000000c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle02671naa a2200469 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100002500133245006500158300001600223300002300239520121800262650002501480650002401505650001501529650003201544650002001576650002501596650003801621650005601659650001101715650004201726650002901768650004901797651001201846651001801858653002201876653002001898653002501918653003401943653002601977700002102003773010202024852000902126939003302135945000802168946001302176655001202189991618927660742620221117204216.0810420e198010  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI810008852DNAL7 a74198352pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPonder, Kay Burcham.10aCourt-ordered dietary standards: RDAs and mental retardation  ap. 428-433.  ap. 428-433. chart.  aIn 1971, a landmark court case in Alabama set precedents and standards for public institutions treating mentally retarded individuals including minimum nutritional requirements based on the Recommended Dietary Allowances and the Moderate Cost Food Plan of the USDA; provisions were also made for special therapeutic diets and religious requirements. Mentally disabled people have very specialized nutritional requirements, however; their unique problems include eating difficulties, neuromotor dysfunction, and drug therapy, all of which must be evaluated in determining nutritional adequacy. The importance of these factors in preventing malnutrition has been supported in many studies, and makes the services of a registered dietitian essential not only in nutritional support services but in compliance with regulations. Recommendations include better definition and documentation of staffing requirements; studies on energy requirements of specific disabilities, long term effects of food consistency, feeding techniques, and growth and disability relationships; identification of training needs; better information dissemination; and compilation of knowledge from applicable studies with information on RDAs. 3alaws and regulations 3anutritional support 3adietitians 3afood and nutrition programs 2aDietxstandards 2aDieteticsxeducation 2aFood Service, Hospitalxstandards 2aHospitals, Psychiatricxlegislation & jurisprudence 2aHumans 2aIntellectual Disabilityxdiet therapy 2aNutritional Requirements 2aPersonnel Staffing and Schedulingxstandards 0aAlabama 0aUnited States 0aDietary standards 0aEating problems 0aMentally handicapped 0aResidential care institutions 0aSpecial groups, diets1 aBergman, Joan S.0 tJournal of the American Dietetic Association.g1980 Oct., v. 77, no. 4 p.428-433x0002-82237nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19810420c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle03013naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001900144245012900163300001600292500001500308520147700323650001301800650001401813650003501827650002101862650001501883650002901898650001401927650003901941650001801980650002401998650001502022650001802037650001602055653002602071653002002097653001502117653001602132653002302148653001702171700002102188700002002209700001502229773007002244852000902314856009102323930003302414945002502447946001102472655001202483IND4416203620221117204224.0090213e200810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441620362DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aAtsumi, Yusuke10aRestriction of Germline Proliferation by Soft X-ray Irradiation of Chicken Embryos and its Application to Chimera Production  ap. 292-297.  a2019-12-06  aPrimordial germ cells (PGCs) are the progenitor cells of gametes. Avian PGCs are located in the central region of the area pellucida at the blastoderm stage. PGCs enter the circulation soon after the formation of blood vessels in incubating eggs and eventually settle in the gonadal primordium. We have now examined exposure of chicken embryos to soft (low-energy) x-rays as a means of depleting endogenous PGCs and thereby improving the efficiency of chimera production. The blastoderm of White Leghorn eggs was exposed to soft x-rays for 0, 20, 40 or 60s before incubation. The irradiated embryos manifested delayed development at 60h of incubation. They also showed reduced numbers of circulating PGCs at stages 14 and 15 and of gonadal PGCs at stage 30. The hatchability of irradiated embryos was lower than that of nonirradiated controls. Irradiation for 20s was found to provide the best outcome taking into consideration both the restriction of PGC proliferation and hatchability. Dispersed blastoderm cells of quail (black plumage) embryos were introduced into the blastoderm of chicken embryos irradiated for 20 s or of nonirradiated embryos. The number of donor-derived PGCs was higher in the irradiated embryos than in the nonirradiated controls at stage 30. These results suggest that soft x-irradiation of chicken embryos is a feasible approach to depletion of endogenous germ cells and consequent improvement in the efficiency of incorporation of donor PGCs. 3achickens 3aviability 3agenetically modified organisms 3ain vitro culture 3agerm cells 3aphysiological regulation 3achimerism 3aassisted reproductive technologies 3agametogenesis 3agenetic engineering 3ablastoderm 3aembryogenesis 3aX-radiation 0aprimordial germ cells 0aembryo (animal) 0ablastocyst 0amethodology 0asoft x-irradiation 0acytogenetics1 aTagami, Takahiro1 aKagami, Hiroshi1 aOno, Tamao0 pJ. poult. scig2008 Oct., v. 45, no. 4 p.292-297x1346-73957nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/browse/jpsa/-char/en/3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090326b20090508c00000000  aINDd4CTe2009/03/11  aNon-US 7aarticle02281naa a2200553 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001600133245006700149300001600216300002400232520078200256650002601038650001701064650001701081650001401098650001201112650002401124650001401148650003201162650001801194650002201212650001601234650001601250650002101266650001101287650003801298650002401336650001101360650000901371650001601380650003801396650002301434651001301457653002001470700001601490700001701506700001401523700001301537773010201550852000901652939003301661945000801694946001301702655001201715991618927350742620221117204220.0810420e198010  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI810008912DNAL7 a74198412pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBushman, L.10aMalnutrition among patients in an acute-care veterans facility  ap. 462-465.  ap. 462-465. charts.  aA survey of 161 patients in a veteran's hospital was conducted to determine the incidence of malnutrition, based on 4 anthropometric measurements.

  1 aPirany, Nasrollah10aMicrosatellite Analysis of Genetic Diversity in Indian Chicken Populations  ap. 19-28.  a2019-12-06  aCharacterization of genetic diversity by employing molecular tools is a prerequisite in developing strategies for conservation and utilization of poultry genetic resources. We assessed genetic variation within and between six Indian chicken populations (Naked Neck, White Silkies, Commercial Layer and Broiler, Giriraja and Desi) using nine microsatellite markers. Seven loci were polymorphic in all populations, with the number of alleles varying from 3 to 27per locus and 4.1 to 8.6per population. Average heterozygosity and gene diversity in the populations were 0.68 and 0.66, respectively. Some populations and loci deviated from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Except Naked Neck, none of other populations was in genotypic disequilibrium for a single pairwise locus combination. F-statistics indicated that populations are genetically structured, approximately 85% of the total genetic variation being due to genetic differentiation within the populations. Estimates of Latter's F(ST) and Nei's D(S) genetic distances revealed relatively close genetic similarity between Naked Neck and Giriraja, while White Silkies was the most distant. An estimated divergence time between Naked Neck and Giriraja was over100 years, with a comparatively longer (over 450 years) period of separation between Giriraja and White Silkies. We suggest that there is an essential room left for genetic improvement of Indian native breeds and commercial stocks. 3achickens 3amathematical models 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aalleles 3aloci 3alandraces 3achicken breeds 3aequations 3agenetic distance 3aheterozygosity 3agenetic variation 3agenetic polymorphism 3agenetic markers 3aIndia 0amolecular sequence data 0agenotype 0apopulation genetics1 aRomanov, Michael N.1 aGanpule, Suhash P.1 aDevegowda, Govindaiah1 aPrasad, Doddananjappa T.0 pJ. poult. scig2007 Jan., v. 44, no. 1 p.19-28x1346-73957nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/browse/jpsa/-char/en/3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090408b20090508c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/03/15  aNon-US 7aarticle02354naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129100001500146245008200161300001600243500001500259520107800274650002501352650001301377650001401390650002401404650001501428650001901443650001901462650002801481650002101509650002401530650002301554650003401577650002401611653002101635653002301656653002101679653002501700700001501725773006601740852000901806930003301815945002501848946001101873655001201884IND4364916720221117204253.0041013e200409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436491672DNAL7 a152326952pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

They are composed of hybrid histidine kinases, histidine-containing phosphotransfer domain proteins and response regulators that are biochemically linked by His-to-Asp phosphorelay. In plants two-component systems play a major role in cytokinin perception and signalling and contribute to ethylene signal transduction and osmosensing. Furthermore, developmental processes like megagametogenesis in Arabidopsis thaliana and flowering promotion in rice (Oryza sativa) involve elements of two-component systems. Two-component-like elements also function as components of the Arabidopsis circadian clock. Because of the molecular mode of signalling, plant two-component systems also appear to serve as intensive cross talk and signal integration machinery. In this review we summarize the present knowledge about the principles and functions of two-component systems in higher plants and address several critical points with respect to cross talk, signal integration and specificity. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aethylene 3aflowering 3asignal transduction 3acytokinins 3aplant response 3aosmoregulation 2aArabidopsisxphysiology 2aCircadian Rhythm 2aFlowersxphysiology 2aOryzaxphysiology. 2aPlant Physiological Phenomena 2aReceptor Cross-Talk 0amegagmetogenesis 0aliterature reviews 0aplant physiology 0atwo component system1 aHarter, K.0 tPlanta.g2004 Sept., v. 219, no. 5 p.733-742x0032-09357nnas  aDNAL  a20041029b20041101c00000000  aINDdRSCe2004/10/29  aNon-US 7aarticle01130naa a2200241 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075040001800099245005200117300001200169520047400181650001700655650001400672653002200686653002500708653001700733773007600750852000900826939003300835945000800868655001200876991618926100742620221117204228.0780901e19780501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7894833472DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL10aHolding equipment can heat up foodservice sales  ap. 139.  aIf short term food holding equipment is used as it is designed to be used, it can solve the holding problem and help operators sell more food.

In grower period (5-20wk), ME required for maintenance, activity and growth was calculated targeting 100g increases in BW/week in control (C) group. In another group, ME was quantitatively reduced by 20% (R) over C. Both groups were offered measured quantity of grower diet to satisfy the scheduled energy inputs. At 21 weeks, C and R groups were individually sub-grouped into four each, to either restrict energy severely (S-20%), moderately (M-10%) or increase (E-10%) over control. Thus, 8 sub-groups were formed: CS, CM, CC, CE and RS, RM, RC, RR. The CC and RC sub-groups were offered calculated ME for 50g increase in BW/week and anticipated egg production. Measured amount of breeder diet was offered to each sub-group following energy schedule. At 20 weeks, significant increase in BW was observed in C-group with better conversion efficiency of feed, energy and protein compared to R-group. The R-group had lesser abdominal fat and liver weights, higher muscle protein and lower fat than C-group. Breeders in R-group matured late by 7.7 days, but produced significantly more eggs with better-feed efficiency up to 64 weeks than C-group. In laying phase, breeders maintained on 20 and 10% less energy (RM) during rearing and production periods, respectively matured late, but produced significantly more eggs with higher persistency than CC. At 68 weeks, maximum fertility and hatchability on total eggs set was recorded in RM sub-group. These results showed complimentary influence of grower and breeder energy restriction on egg and chick production and saved feed substantially in RM sub-group. It appeared that the energy requirement under energy restriction was lesser than that calculated. 3aviability 3aweight gain 3arestricted feeding 3aenergy intake 3arearing 3abroiler breeders 3aenergy metabolism 3afeed conversion 3aeggs 3aenergy deprivation 3achicks 3aliveweight gain 3alaying performance 3aovulation 3ametabolizable energy 3ahens 3ahen feeding 3aprotective effect 0anutrient utilization 0aanimal reproduction1 aKumar, Ch.

  1 aFord, C.R.10aAssessing variation in the radial profile of sap flux density in Pinus species and its effect on daily water use  ap. 241-249.  aWe monitored sap flux density (v) diurnally in nine mature southeastern pine (Pinus spp.) trees with a thermal dissipation probe that spanned the sapwood radius. We found the expected pattern of high v near the cambium and decreasing v with depth toward the center of the tree; however, the pattern was not constant within a day or between trees. Radial profiles of trees were steeper earlier in the day and became less steep later in the day. As a result, time-dependent changes in the shape of the radial profile of v were sometimes correlated with daily changes in evaporative demand. As the radial profile became less steep, the inner xylem contributed relatively more to total tree sap flow than it did earlier in the day. We present a 3-parameter Gaussian function that can be used to describe the radial distribution of v in trees. Parameters in the function represent depth in the xylem from the cambium, maximum v, depth in the xylem where maximum v occurs, and the rate of radial change in v with radial depth (β). Values of β varied significantly between trees and with time, and were sometimes correlated with air vapor pressure deficit (D). We hypothesize that this occurred during periods of high transpiration when the water potential gradient became great enough to move water in the inner sapwood despite its probable high hydraulic resistance. We examined discrepancies among estimates of daily water use based on single-point, two-point and multi-point (i.e., every 20 mm in the sapwood) measurements. When radial distribution of v was not considered, a single-point measurement resulted in errors as large as 154% in the estimate of daily water use relative to the estimate obtained from a multi-point measurement. Measuring v at two close sample points (10 and 30 mm) did not improve the estimate; however, estimates derived from v measured at two distant sample points (10 and 70 mm) significantly improved the estimate of daily water use, although errors were as great as 32% in individual trees. The variability in v with depth in the xylem, over time, and between trees indicates that measurements of the radial distribution of v are necessary to accurately estimate water flow in trees with large sapwood areas. 3aPinus palustris 3aPinus echinata 3aPinus elliottii 3aPinus taeda 3aforest trees 3astems 3asapwood 3asap flow 3ameasurement 3aroot hydraulic conductivity 3adiurnal variation 3amathematical models 3aequations 2aCircadian Rhythmxphysiology 2aPinusxphysiology 2aPlant Stemsxphysiology 2aPlant Transpirationxphysiology 2aTreesxphysiology 2aWaterxphysiology 3aGeorgia1 aMcGuire, M.A.1 aMitchell, R.J.1 aTeskey, R.O.0 tTree physiology.g2004 Mar., v. 24, no. 3 p.241-249x0829-318X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/treephys/24.3.2413Available from publisher's Web site  aINDdMKSe2004/05/20  aNon-US 7aarticle02682naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100002600161245016500187300001600352500001500368520107700383650002101460650002801481650002101509650002001530650002001550650001101570650002101581650002001602650001701622650001901639650001801658650001601676650002001692650002401712650001801736650002101754650001801775650001001793650001101803650001601814650001401830653002001844700002501864773007001889852000901959856009101968930003302059945002502092946001102117655001202128IND4423214120221117204119.0090715e200904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442321412DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

An experiment of five dietary treatment groups with different levels of thyme was conducted in broiler chickens from 1 to 42 days of age. Dietary thyme significantly increased body weight and body weight gain, and improved feed conversion ratio. The serum levels of glucose, total protein, and globulin were significantly increased by the addition of thyme. The serum levels of triglyceride and cholesterol were significantly decreased. The lengths of gastrointestinal tract segments were decreased by feeding 1.0%, 1.5% and 2.0% thyme. The same levels of thyme improved dressing and breast percentage of female broilers, and 1.5% and 2.0% thyme feedings improved significantly the leg and wing percentage. Same trends were observed in male broilers. These findings suggest that thyme can be used as a natural growth promoter in broiler rations particularly at 1.5% and 2.0% level. 3agrowth promotion 3acarcass characteristics 3abroiler chickens 3aliveweight gain 3adigestive tract 3alength 3afeed supplements 3abroiler feeding 3ablood lipids 3ablood proteins 3abreast muscle 3abody weight 3afeed conversion 3adressing percentage 3ablood glucose 3atriacylglycerols 3aanimal growth 3athyme 3adosage 3acholesterol 3aglobulins 0ablood chemistry1 aAl-Beitawi, Nafez A.0 pJ. poult. scig2009 Apr., v. 46, no. 2 p.100-104x1346-73957nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/browse/jpsa/-char/en/3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090821b20091002c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/07/31  aNon-US 7aarticle02455naa a2200589 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100002100133245006600154300001600220300003000236500001500266520074000281650001301021650002101034650002601055650002901081650002401110650001701134650002501151650002301176650001801199650002501217650002201242650001101264650001801275650001401293650001101307650003101318650002301349650000901372650002501381650004801406650004001454650003701494650003401531651001201565653001601577653001701593700002801610700002001638700003001658773010201688852000901790939003301799945000801832946001301840655001201853991618925320742620221117204100.0810515e198102  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI810010482DNAL7 a72175662pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWinborn, Anne L.12aA protocol for nutritional assessment in a community hospital  ap. 129-134.  ap. 129-134. ill., charts.  a2019-12-05  aAssessment of nutritional status and planning of rehabilitation based on a weekly Anergic/Metabolic Profile are focused on dietary history, total body proteins (somatic and visceral), cell-mediated immunity and a calculated nitrogen balance.

  1 aPourtau, N.10aInteractions of abscisic acid and sugar signalling in the regulation of leaf senescence  ap. 765-772.  a2019-12-05  aLeaf senescence can be triggered by a high availability of carbon relative to nitrogen or by external application of abscisic acid (ABA). Most Arabidopsis mutants with decreased sugar sensitivity during early plant development are either ABA insensitive (abi mutants) or ABA deficient (aba mutants). To analyse the interactions of carbon, nitrogen and ABA in the regulation of senescence, wild-type Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. and aba and abi mutants were grown on medium with varied glucose and nitrogen supply. On medium containing glucose in combination with low, but not in combination with high nitrogen supply, senescence was accelerated and sucrose, glucose and fructose accumulated strongly. In abi mutants that are not affected in sugar responses during early development (abi1-1 and abi2-1), we observed no difference in the sugar-dependent regulation of senescence compared to wild-type plants. Similarly, senescence was not affected in the sugar-insensitive abi4-1 mutant. In contrast, the abi5-1 mutant did exhibit a delay in senescence compared to its wild type. As ABA has been reported to induce senescence and ABA deficiency results in sugar insensitivity during early development, we expected senescence to be delayed in aba mutants. However, the aba1-1 and aba2-1 mutants showed accelerated senescence compared to their wild types on glucose-containing medium. Our results show that, in contrast to sugar signalling in seedlings, ABA is not required for the sugar-dependent induction of leaf senescence. Instead, increased sensitivity to osmotic stress could have triggered early senescence in the aba mutants. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3atranscription factors 3aethylene 3aflowering 3abioaccumulation 3aglucose 3anitrogen 3asignal transduction 3amutants 3anutrient solutions 3aabscisic acid 3aleaves 3aplant proteins 2aAbscisic Acidxphysiology. 2aAging 2aArabidopsisxgrowth & development 2aChlorophyllxmetabolism 2aFlowersxgrowth & development 2aGlucosexpharmacology 2aKinetics 2aNitrogenxpharmacology 2aPlant Leavesxgrowth & development 2aSucrosexmetabolism 0asenescence 0asugars 0aleaf senescence 0aapetala2 gene1 aMares, M.1 aPurdy, S.1 aQuentin, N.1 aRuel, A.1 aWingler, A.0 tPlanta.g2004 Sept., v. 219, no. 5 p.765-772x0032-09357nnas  aDNAL  a20041029b20041101c00000000  aINDdRSCe2004/10/29  aNon-US 7aarticle02668naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245008400127300001800211500020000229500001500429520137400444650002301818650002201841650001201863650002101875650002001896650001901916650002101935650001501956653001601971653002301987653002102010653001102031653001602042700001702058700002102075773008202096852000902178930003302187945001302220946001302233655001202246IND2180396820221117203544.0981009e199802  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND218039682DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReilly, M.P.10aEicosanoids and isoeicosanoids: indices of cellular function and oxidant stress  ap. 434S-438S.  aPaper presented at the 1997 American Society for Nutrition Sciences Symposium Conference on Evolution of Ideas about the Nutritional Value of Dietary Fat, April 6-9, 1997, New Orleans, Louisiana.  a2019-12-05  aArachidonic acid (AA) is an unsaturated fatty acid constituent of the phospholipid domain of cell membranes. It is subject to release via mobilization of phospholipases, particularly a cytoplasmic phospholipase A2. Thereafter, it may be metabolized by at least two cyclooxygenase (COX) isoforms to prostaglandins and related compounds, via lipoxygenases to leukotrienes and via p450-catalyzed metabolism to epoxyeicosatrienoic acids. Collectively, these bioactive lipids are termed eicosanoids. All of these lipids express potent bioactivity in vitro. Clinical studies have already demonstrated the importance of COX and lipoxygenase (LOX) products in human disease. The generation of models of COX, LOX and prostaglandin receptor gene inactivation is likely to broaden our insight into the importance of these compounds in vivo. Crystallization of the biosynthetic enzymes is likely to facilitate the development of highly specific inhibitors, as is the case already for COX-2. AA possesses intrinsic biological properties. It is also subject to free radical attack, generating isomeric eicosanoid species, the isoeicosanoids. These compounds may also express biological activity in vitro, although their importance in vivo is unclear. Development of specific assays for these compounds in urine suggests their utility as noninvasive indices of oxidant stress in vivo. 3alipid peroxidation 3ahormone receptors 3aisomers 3aarachidonic acid 3agene expression 3aprostaglandins 3alipid metabolism 3aoxygenases 0aeicosanoids 0aliterature reviews 0aclinical aspects 0astress 0asioprostane1 aLawson, J.A.1 aFitzGerald, G.A.0 tJournal of nutrition.g1998 Feb., v. 128, no. 2S p.434S-438Sx0022-31667nnas  aDNAL  a19981201b19981208c00000000  aINDdHBI  aOther US 7aarticle02469naa a2200553 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100002500133245009900158300001600257300002400273520085500297650002401152650001301176650002301189650001201212650001201224650002001236650000901256650003201265650002301297650001501320650001001335650001801345650004601363650001801409650001101427650005301438650001101491650004701502650002101549650000901570650001601579650002901595650002101624650002501645650002501670650002101695700002201716773010201738852000901840939003301849945000801882946001301890655001201903991618924440742620221117203531.0810518e198102  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI810010492DNAL7 a72175672pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUpdegraff, Tarine A.10aProtein, iron, and folate status of patients prior to and following surgery for morbid obesity  ap. 135-140.  ap. 135-140. charts.  aNutritional status of 32 obese patients was determined by intake recall just before and 4 months after intestinal bypass surgery.

Other assessment parameters were anthropometric measurements, urine creatine, and serum iron, transferrin, and folate levels. Pre-surgery intakes of protein and iron met RDA's, and folate intake was significantly lower; all 3 decreased after surgery, possibly related to the use of nutrient supplements. Changes in anthropometric measurements did not correlate to creatinine-height index. Several parameters suggested loss of skeletal muscle protein.

  1 aFujiwara, Akira10aRegeneration of Muscular Dystrophy Chickens by Transplantation of Early Blastodermal Cells into Recipient Embryos  ap. 46-51.  a2019-12-06  aA novel strategy has been developed to generate muscular dystrophy chickens by means of germline chimeras. Donor embryos were obtained from the New Hampshire chicken; NH-413 strain which have genes responsible for Fukuyama type muscular dystrophy (Saito et al., 2005). Donor cells were isolated from the center of area pellucida of the blastoderms. Recipient embryos were obtained from White Leghorn chicken; Line-M. The generated chimeric chickens had the donor derived brown plumage in the down in some extent, suggesting that the cells containing muscular dystrophy were introduced into the chimeras. These chimeric chickens have been raised until sexual maturity. The chimeric chickens were back-crossed to donor strain; the NH-413 strain. The phenotype of some of the offspring was very similar to that of the donor strain. The offspring showed some characters typical to the muscular dystrophy. It was suggested that the donor derived NH-413 strain offspring was generated. The established system should be one of the powerful strategies for breeding and regeneration of the muscular dystrophy chickens. 3achickens 3agerm cells 3aphenotype 3adevelopmental stages 3amuscular dystrophy 3apoultry diseases 3acell transplantation 3achimerism 3aWhite Leghorn 3ablastoderm 3aJapan 0aregeneration 0aembryo (animal) 0aNew Hampshire (chicken breed) 0aFukuyama type muscular dystrophy1 aOno, Tamao1 aKagami, Hiroshi0 pJ. poult. scig2009 Jan., v. 46, no. 1 p.46-51x1346-73957nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/browse/jpsa/46/1/_contents3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090506b20090608c00000000  aINDd3CTe2009/04/20  aNon-US 7aarticle02726naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245013800127300001400265500027100279500002400550520129900574650001801873650002501891650001601916650001201932650001401944650001701958650004301975650001902018650000902037650002002046700002102066700001702087700001602104773013802120852000902258856008502267655001202352IND4464943020221117205105.0130215s2012    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446494302DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOlsson, M.E.10aHow to optimize the content of bioactive compounds-effects of cultivar, harvest time and processing in orange, yellow and red carrots  ap. 71-76.  aPaper presented at the International Symposium on Emerging Health Topics in Fruits and Vegetables, IHC 2010, Organized on the Occasion of the 28th International Horticultural Congress on Science and Horticulture for People, held August 22-27, 2010, Lisbon, Portugal.  aIncludes references  aCompounds in fruit and vegetables have been suggested to exert the health-promoting effect resulting in lower risk of some common diseases with a diet higher in these products. Since the health beneficial effect has been attributed to certain compounds, individually, or in synergistic combination, it is of interest to increase knowledge of which factors that influence the levels of these compounds. The differences in the content of vitamin C, polyacetylenes and carotenoids in a range of orange and red cultivars of carrot were analysed by HPLC, and the effect of harvest date was also investigated in the red cultivars. In addition, the effects of different processing steps were investigated in orange, yellow and red carrots. Large differences were found in the content of polyacetylenes and carotenoids between cultivars and with the size of the carrots. Different processing steps were found to affect the content of vitamin C and polyacetylenes to different extent. In addition, the processing did not affect the different colours of carrot in a similar way, which might implicate a possible interaction among the investigated compounds. By proper selec-tion of carrots, and by a combination of colours, cultivars and harvest praxis, the content of these compounds could be optimised. 3aascorbic acid 3abioactive properties 3acarotenoids 3acarrots 3acultivars 3aharvest date 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3apolyacetylenes 3arisk 3avitamin content1 aGustavsson, K.E.1 aStegmark, R.1 aNystrom, S.0 tActa horticulturae.g2012 Nov., , no. 939 p.71-76dInternational Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/939/939_8.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02340naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001300127245014900140300001600289500001500305520115800320650002601478650002001504650002001524650002101544650001901565650004301584650002101627650003901648650001001687653002501697700001301722700001601735700001301751773009801764852000901862930003301871945002501904946001301929655001201942IND4373585820221117205103.0050825e200511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437358582DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aAoun, E.10aHigh-performance liquid chromatographic and spectrofluorometric determination of α-tocopherol in a natural plant: Ferula hermonis (Zalooh root)  ap. 607-615.  a2019-12-05  aA high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method for the determination of alpha-tocopherol in a natural plant (Ferula hermonis-Zalooh roots) is reported. The method includes saponification of samples and extraction of alpha-tocopherol with a mixture of acetonitrile and methanol (1:1 v/v). However, the presence of alpha-tocopherol in Zalooh is confirmed with HPLC-UV and fluorescence detection. A spectrofluorometric and the internal addition standard methods are also used to quantify the alpha-tocopherol in the plant. An internal standard method is based on a known concentration of alpha-tocopherol that is added in every sample that is analyzed. Alpha-tocopherol levels as determined in samples by HPLC with UV and fluorescence detection (approximately equal to 5 +/- 0.5 mg/g) did not differ significantly from the levels determined by Shimadzu spectrofluorometer (4.9 +/- 0.5 mg/g). However, the amount of tocopherol determined by both techniques in Zalooh roots was relatively very high. Standards were checked for linearity giving correlation coefficients that were higher than 0.99 in the concentration range of 1 and 6 micromol L(-1). 3aquantitative analysis 3avitamin content 3aFerula hermonis 3amedicinal plants 3aplant extracts 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aalpha-tocopherol 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3aroots 0achemical composition1 aRima, J.1 aChidiac, G.1 aHanna K.0 tSubtropical plant science.g2005 Nov., v. 18, no. 7 p.607-615wJournal:20855x0485-20447nnas  aDNAL  a20051011b20051102c00000000  aINDdPNNe2005/09/01  aOther US 7aarticle02430naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100001300161245008700174300001600261500001500277520106300292650002501355650001801380650001001398650001701408650001201425650002301437650001901460650002101479650001001500650002201510650001501532650002501547650001201572650001701584651001001601653002001611653001701631653002301648700001801671700001301689700001401702773011601716852000901832930003301841945002501874946001301899655001201912IND4373586120221117205101.0050825e200511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437358612DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Water extract solution (WE) and ethanolic extract solution (EE) were prepared from three brown algae, Phaeophyceae Scytosiphon lomentaria (kayamo-nori, dried product), Papenfussiella kuromo (kuromo, fresh-raw product) and Nemacystus decipiens (mozuku, fresh-raw product), and one Rhodophyceae Porphyra sp. (nori, dried product). We also studied their phenol contents and antioxidant properties including (1) suppression of hemoglobin-induced linoleic acid peroxidation, (2) reducing power, (3) ferrous ion chelating, (4) 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging and (5) scavenging of superoxide anion radical-generated non-enzymatic system. WE contained phenolic compounds about 2.2-9.4 mg catechin equivalent (CE)/g dry sample and showed strong antioxidant activities, although the results were varied with the five test models. On the other hand, the antioxidant activities of EE were not detected or very low compared to the ones of WE. 3achemical composition 3afree radicals 3aalgae 3aEctocarpales 3aphenols 3alipid peroxidation 3aplant extracts 3aseaweed products 3awater 3atraditional foods 3aextraction 3aantioxidant activity 3aethanol 3aantioxidants 3aJapan 0aScytosiphonales 0aPhaeophyceae 0aalgae and seaweeds1 aTsunekawa, M.1 aGoto, H.1 aAraki, Y.0 tJournal of food composition and analysis.g2005 Nov., v. 18, no. 7 p.625-633wJournal:jnl42192x0889-15757nnas  aDNAL  a20051011b20051102c00000000  aINDdPNNe2005/09/01  aOther US 7aarticle02757naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001300110245008100123300001600204500027100220500002400491520153400515650002502049650001702074650001402091650001502105650001602120650001702136700001302153700001502166700001502181773014002196852000902336856008602345655001202431IND4464944720221117204746.0130215s2012    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446494472DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, C.C.10aAntioxidant capacity in the peel of eleven China-grown pomegranate cultivars  ap. 175-181.  aPaper presented at the International Symposium on Emerging Health Topics in Fruits and Vegetables, IHC 2010, Organized on the Occasion of the 28th International Horticultural Congress on Science and Horticulture for People, held August 22-27, 2010, Lisbon, Portugal.  aIncludes references  aIn this research, the contents of total polyphenols and flavonoids in the peel of 11 China-grown pomegranate cultivars were investigated with the methods of Folin-Ciocalteu and NaNO2-Al(NO3)3-NaOH, respectively. Total antioxidant capacity was determined using ferric reducing antioxidant capacity (FRAP) assay. The results showed that ‘Fentian’ had the highest polyphenols content followed by ‘Danhong’, ‘Chuanhui’, ‘Xingzi’, ‘DRF-1’, ‘D3’, ‘Chonghuang’, ‘Chongfen’, ‘Baiyue’, ‘Dasuan’, and ‘Damo’. By comparing the flavonoids content in the peel of different cultivars, the following trend was observed: ‘DRF-1’ > ‘D3’ > ‘Chuanhui’ > ‘Fentian’ > ‘Chonghuang’ > ‘Xingzi’ > ‘Danhong’ > ‘Dasuan’ > ‘Chongfen’ > ‘Baiyue’ > ‘Damo. This evidence indicates that the two antioxidants contents in pomegranate peel may be cultivar-specific. Among the eleven cultivars, the trend in total peel antioxidant capacity was ‘Fentian’ > ‘Danhong’ > ‘Xingzi’ > ‘D3’ > ‘Chuanghui’ > ‘DRF-1’ > ‘Chonghuang’ > ‘Dasuan’ > ‘Baiyue’ > ‘Damo’ > ‘Chongfen’. Correlation analysis showed that the total antioxidant capacity in the peel had a strong linear relationship with the polyphenols content (r=0.90), indicating the total antioxidant capacity of pomegranate peel may be attributed to the content of total polyphenols. Together, this study may be beneficial in the cultivar selection and application of pomegranate peel. 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3acultivars 3aflavonoids 3apolyphenols 3apomegranates1 aXu, J.Z.1 aShao, J.Z.1 aYang, X.Y.0 tActa horticulturae.g2012 Nov., , no. 939 p.175-181dInternational Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/939/939_22.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle04559naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245014400125300001600269500027100285500002400556500001500580520260100595650001603196650001503212650001303227650004303240650002003283650001403303650001003317650001403327650000903341650001403350650001003364650001703374650001703391650001303408650001703421650002803438650002103466650001103487650001203498650001403510650001003524650001103534650002503545650001303570650001603583651001003599653001903609700001503628700001703643700001803660700001803678700001403696773014003710852000903850856008603859655001203945IND4464945020221117204802.0130215s2012    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446494502DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRusso, Mt.10aCharacterization of different 'Tropea Red Onion' (Allium cepa L.) ecotypes by aroma precursors, aroma profiles and polyphenolic composition  ap. 197-203.  aPaper presented at the International Symposium on Emerging Health Topics in Fruits and Vegetables, IHC 2010, Organized on the Occasion of the 28th International Horticultural Congress on Science and Horticulture for People, held August 22-27, 2010, Lisbon, Portugal.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aMany epidemiological studies have shown that the consumption of fruits and vegetables is associated with a reduced risk for the development of chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease and cancer. Phytochemicals, including polyphenols and flavonoids, are suggested to be the major bioactive compounds of fruits and vegetables contributing to the health benefits. Onion bulbs (Allium cepa L.) are among the richest sources of dietary flavonoids and contribute to a large extent to the overall daily intake of flavonoids. A particular sweet red onion, ‘Tropea Red Onion’, characterized by a large red envelope and internal white tunics, grown in Calabria region (south of Italy), for the excellent organoleptic characteristics (tenderness, crispness, sweetness), is considered the pride of Calabrian’s horticultural products. Because of the few available scientific studies on this particular red onion, a large-scale study to characterize different ‘Tropea red onion’ ecotypes was started. Onions contain bioactive components belonging to two main chemical groups: the flavonoids and the alk(en)yl cysteine sulphoxides (ACSOs). Flavonoid and in particular the anthocyanins and flavanols such as quercetin were found in onion while the ACSOs are the flavour precursors, which, when cleaved by the enzyme alliinase, generate the characteristic odour and taste of onion (thiosulphinates, thiosulphonates, mono-, di- and tri-sulphides). Because of the few available scientific studies on this particular red onion, a large-scale study was started to characterize different ‘Tropea red onion’ ecotypes and to identify markers of authentication to protect it on the national and international market. Moreover, ‘Tropea red onion’ ecotypes are evaluated for their characteristic tastes, aroma profile and for their flavonoids composition in comparison with other red onions. The alk(en)yl-L-cysteine sulphoxides ACSOs are the main precursors of onion flavour due to the presence of thiosulphinates, thiosulphonates, mono-, di- and tri-sulphides that arise in the ground tissues after reaction with the enzyme alliinase. The components of aroma profile are correlated with the pattern of aroma precursors (cysteine sulfoxides). Altogether at least 25 different flavonols have been character¬ized; quercetin derivatives are the most important flavonoids in Calabrian onion ecotypes. Analogous derivatives of kaempferol and isorhamnetin have been identified as minor pigments. HPLC, GC/MS, SPME/GC/MS, and e-nose had been used to classify different ‘Tropea red onion’ ecotypes. 3apolyphenols 3akaempferol 3ahardness 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aelectronic nose 3aflavanols 3aodors 3asweetness 3arisk 3aneoplasms 3abulbs 3ahorticulture 3aisorhamnetin 3acysteine 3aanthocyanins 3aepidemiological studies 3achronic diseases 3aonions 3amarkets 3aquercetin 3ataste 3afruits 3abioactive properties 3aecotypes 3aAllium cepa 3aItaly 0aphytochemicals1 aCefaly, V.1 aDi Sanzo, R.1 aCarabetta, S.1 aPostorino, S.1 aSerra, D.0 tActa horticulturae.g2012 Nov., , no. 939 p.197-203dInternational Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/939/939_25.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02254naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149072000900158072000900167100001600176245005500192300001600247500002400263520098100287650001801268650001901286650001501305650002401320650000901344650002901353651001001382651001801392653001801410653003001428653002001458700001601478700002601494700001601520773009301536852000901629856008901638930003301727945002501760946001101785655001201796IND4403752320221117204714.0080329e20080515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440375232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2008.01.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aP200 0aJ800 0aX1001 aTyagi, J.V.10aSCS-CN based time-distributed sediment yield model  ap. 388-403.  aIncludes references  aA sediment yield model is developed to estimate the temporal rates of sediment yield from rainfall events on natural watersheds. The model utilizes the SCS-CN based infiltration model for computation of rainfall-excess rate, and the SCS-CN-inspired proportionality concept for computation of sediment-excess. For computation of sedimentographs, the sediment-excess is routed to the watershed outlet using a single linear reservoir technique. Analytical development of the model shows the ratio of the potential maximum erosion (A) to the potential maximum retention (S) of the SCS-CN method is constant for a watershed. The model is calibrated and validated on a number of events using the data of seven watersheds from India and the USA. Representative values of the A/S ratio computed for the watersheds from calibration are used for the validation of the model. The encouraging results of the proposed simple four parameter model exhibit its potential in field application. 3awater erosion 3asediment yield 3awatersheds 3awatershed hydrology 3arain 3ainfiltration (hydrology) 3aIndia 3aUnited States 0aSCS-CN method 0apotential maximum erosion 0asediment excess1 aMishra, SK.1 aSiṃha, Raṇavīra.1 aSingh, V.P.0 tJournal of hydrology.g2008 May 15, v. 352, no. 3-4 p.388-403dElsevierx0022-16947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2008.01.0253Available from publisher's Web site  a20081110b20081206c00000000  aINDdRHFe2008/11/10  aNon-US 7aarticle02663naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129100001700146245009700163300001600260520127000276650001901546650002201565650001201587650002301599650001501622650001801637650001401655650002601669650001001695650001601705650002501721650002401746650001801770650003101788650001601819650003601835650001601871650002101887653002001908700001601928700001701944700002001961700002101981773006502002852000902067930003302076945002502109946001102134655001202145IND4363895920221117204336.0040816e200407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436389592DNAL7 a150546602pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

'Quatre Saisons'  ap. 468-478.  aThe control of rhythmic emission of floral volatiles emitted from Rosa damascena semperflorens cv. 'Quatre Saisons' throughout floral development under various light regimes was studied. 2-Phenylethanol was the major volatile emitted in addition to monoterpenols, oxidised monoterpenols, monoterpenes and aromatic compounds. All detected volatiles were emitted rhythmically, with maximum peaks coinciding 8-10 h into a 12-h photoperiod. For some compounds a secondary, nocturnal peak was apparent. The primary and secondary maxima both occurred at approximately 24-h intervals. Rhythms appeared to be regulated endogenously: rhythmic emission continued upon exposure to continuous light or continuous darkness, and a phase shift in emission was induced upon inversion of the photoperiod. Additionally, emission continued after flower excision. A similar profile of free volatiles was stored within the floral tissue, together with glycosidic forms of 2-phenylethanol (>99% beta-D-glucoside), benzyl alcohol, citronellol and geraniol. Regression analysis indicated a significant decrease in glycosylated 2-phenylethanol through the photoperiod. These results suggest that glycosylated volatiles stored within petals may be a source of rhythmically emitted volatiles. 3aRosa damascena 3aornamental plants 3aflowers 3avolatile compounds 3aglycosides 3aglycosylation 3aemissions 3aquantitative analysis 3alight 3aphotoperiod 2aAlcoholsxmetabolism 2aFlowersxmetabolism 2aGlycosylation 2aOils, Volatilexmetabolism 2aPeriodicity 2aPhenylethyl Alcoholxmetabolism 2aPhotoperiod 2aRosaxmetabolism 0a2-phenylethanol1 aClery, R.A.1 aWatanabe, N.1 aMacTavish, H.S.1 aTurnbull, C.G.N.0 tPlanta.g2004 July, v. 219, no. 3 p.468-478x0032-09357nnas  aDNAL  a20040830b20040901c00000000  aINDdRSCe2004/08/23  aNon-US 7aarticle01868naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100002000161245014300181300001600324520071700340650001901057650001401076650001601090650001901106650001101125650001701136650002501153650001801178650002501196700002001221700001701241700001601258773011601274852000901390930003301399945002501432946001301457655001201470IND4377168220221117195921.0060112e200508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437716822DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Anthocyanin content varied from 85.7 to 1914.0 mg kg(-1) fresh berry weight, the mean being 731.7 mg kg(-1). Assessment of the antiradical activity of extracts using the stable 2,2-diphenyl-beta-picrylhydrazyl radical revealed a low and statistically insignificant correlation (r2 = 0.0724, P > 0.05) with total anthocyanin content, suggesting that other constituents are likely to exert strong antioxidant effects in grapes. 3aVitis vinifera 3acultivars 3awine grapes 3afruit extracts 3acyanin 3aantioxidants 3aantioxidant activity 3afree radicals 3achemical composition1 aMohdaly, A.A.A.1 aMakris, D.P.1 aKefalas, P.0 tJournal of food composition and analysis.g2005 Aug., v. 18, no. 5 p.375-386wJournal:jnl42192x0889-15757nnas  aDNAL  a20070927b20071002c00000000  aINDdPNNe2006/01/23  aOther US 7aarticle02811naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002400110245006900134300001500203500027100218500002400489520132500513650002301838650001801861650002501879650002001904650001201924650001201936650001801948650001801966650001001984650001101994650000902005650001102014650001202025650001102037650001402048650001202062650001502074651001602089700002602105773013902131852000902270856008602279655001202365IND4464943720221117195907.0130215s2012    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446494372DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOliveira, G.P.R. de10aIn vitro bioaccessibility of the carotenoids of leafy vegetables  ap. 99-103.  aPaper presented at the International Symposium on Emerging Health Topics in Fruits and Vegetables, IHC 2010, Organized on the Occasion of the 28th International Horticultural Congress on Science and Horticulture for People, held August 22-27, 2010, Lisbon, Portugal.  aIncludes references  aCompositional data on bioactive compounds should be accompanied by infor-mation on bioavailability. Human studies are ultimately required for this purpose, but such studies are time-consuming and complex, limiting their use to few food samples. Thus, simple and rapid in vitro methods have been developed for the initial screening of the relative bioavailabilities of carotenoids. The in vitro bioaccessibility of commercial and uncultivated native Brazilian leafy vegetables (chicory, coriander, kale, lettuce, New Zealand spinach, roquette, water cress, “caruru”, “serralha” and “taioba”) was determined. Among the raw leafy vegetables analyzed, New Zealand spinach had the highest bioaccessibility (14% for β-carotene, 46% for lutein), correlated with the lowest dietary fiber content (2.l g/100 g). “Caruru”, rich in dietary fiber (4.5 g/100 g), had the lowest bioaccessibility (2.3% β-carotene, 6.9% for lutein), although it had the highest carotenoid levels (122 μg/g β-carotene, 136 μg/g lutein). Boiling increased the bioaccessibility. Micellarization of β-carotene and lutein was 3.3 and 18%, respectively, in raw kale, increasing to 16 and 38%, respectively, in boiled kale. The corresponding percentages in New Zealand leaves were 14 and 46% in the raw and 15 and 59% in the boiled form. 3aCoriandrum sativum 3abeta-carotene 3abioactive properties 3abioavailability 3aboiling 3achicory 3adietary fiber 3afiber content 3afoods 3ahumans 3akale 3aleaves 3alettuce 3alutein 3ascreening 3aspinach 3awatercress 3aNew Zealand1 aRodriguez-Amaya, D.B.0 tActa horticulturae.g2012 Nov., , no. 939 p.99-103dInternational Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/939/939_12.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02645naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001400129245009100143300001800234520106500252650001701317650000801334650000901342650001601351650001401367650001401381650002001395650001101415650001001426650001601436650001001452650001101462650001901473650001301492650001401505650001101519650001801530650004401548650001901592650004701611650005401658650002801712650002901740650003401769653003001803653002801833700001501861700001301876700001401889700001901903773006701922852000901989930003301998945001302031946001102044655001202055IND2334201820221117195856.0030930e200304  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233420182DNAL7 a126873732pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, K.S.10aSalinity tolerance of japonica and indica rice (Oryza sativa L.) at the seedling stage  ap. 1043-1046.  aIn order to identify the degree of salinity tolerance of the indica and japonica rice groups, 10 varieties were tested under saline and non-saline conditions. Twelve-day-old seedlings were grown in normal culture solution, then initially salinized at an electrical conductivity (EC) of 6 dS/m for 4 days, and finally salinized at an EC of 12 dS/m for the next 14 days. The growth parameters, and Na and K absorption in the shoot were measured to characterize the tolerance level of the two rice groups. Reduction in all growth parameters of tolerant varieties was significantly lower in indica varieties than in japonica varieties. Tolerant indica varieties were good Na excluders, absorbed high amounts of K, and maintained a low Na/K ratio in the shoot. Tolerant japonica varieties also absorbed less Na but were not as good excluders as indica varieties. Shoot K concentration alone did not show any relationship to salinity tolerance. These results indicate that, for all parameters measured, the tolerance level of indica was higher than that of japonica. 3aOryza sativa 3aice 3arice 3agrain crops 3avarieties 3aseedlings 3aseedling growth 3ashoots 3aroots 3asalt stress 3abirds 3aleaves 3asalt tolerance 3asalinity 3apotassium 3asodium 3aion transport 2aAdaptation, Physiologicalxdrug effects 2aDrug Tolerance 2aOryzaxdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 2aPlant Shootsxdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 2aPotassiumxpharmacology 2aSeedlingsxdrug effects. 2aSodium Chloridexpharmacology 0aoryza sativa cv. japonica 0aoryza sativa cv. indica1 aChoi, W.Y.1 aKo, J.C.1 aKim, T.S.1 aGregorio, G.B.0 tPlanta.g2003 Apr., v. 216, no. 6 p.1043-1046x0032-09357nnas  aDNAL  a20031103b20031113c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle03278naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146100001400163245008700177300001600264520124400280650002501524650001901549650002701568650001501595650002401610650002401634650002201658650001301680650001701693650002201710650001101732650001601743650002001759650002101779650002101800650001701821650001801838650002501856650002801881650002801909650002301937650002001960650002701980650005002007650003902057650002802096650003002124650002002154650001702174650002402191650002102215650003302236650004502269653003402314653002402348700001902372700001802391700001602409773006502425852000902490930003302499945002502532946001102557655001202568IND4363893620221117195237.0040816e200407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436389362DNAL7 a150149982pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aKlaus, D.10aIncreased fatty acid production in potato by engineering of acetyl-CoA carboxylase  ap. 389-396.  aIn contrast to oil seeds, potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) is characterized by a high amount of starch stored in the tubers. To assess the capacity for oil synthesis in potato tubers, the changes in lipid content and flux into lipid synthesis were explored in transgenic potatoes altered in carbohydrate or lipid metabolism. A strong decrease in the amount of starch observed in antisense lines for ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase or plastidic phosphoglucomutase had no effect on storage-lipid content. Similarly, potato lines over-expressing the Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. plastidic ATP/ADP transporter that contained an increased amount of starch were not altered in oil content, indicating that the plastidic ATP level is not limiting fatty acid synthesis in potato tubers. However, over-expression of the acetyl-CoA carboxylase from Arabidopsis in the amyloplasts of potato tubers led to an increase in fatty acid synthesis and a more than 5-fold increase in the amount of triacylglycerol. Taken together, these data demonstrate that potato tubers have the capacity for storage-lipid synthesis and that malonyl-CoA, the substrate for elongation during fatty acid synthesis, represents one of the limiting factors for oil accumulation. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aplant proteins 3aacetyl-CoA carboxylase 3atransgenes 3agenetic engineering 3agene overexpression 3aSolanum tuberosum 3apotatoes 3astarch crops 3atransgenic plants 3atubers 3afatty acids 3adiacylglycerols 3atriacylglycerols 3afree fatty acids 3abiosynthesis 3alipid content 3abiochemical pathways 3acarbohydrate metabolism 3anucleotidyltransferases 3aphosphoglucomutase 3aenzyme activity 3aadenosine triphosphate 2aAcetyl-CoA Carboxylasexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aArabidopsisxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aCarbohydrate Metabolism 2aFatty Acidsxbiosynthesis 2aGene Expression 2aGenes, Plant 2aGenetic Engineering 2aLipid Metabolism 2aPlants, Genetically Modified 2aSolanum tuberosumxgeneticsxmetabolism. 0aADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase 0aATP/ADP transporter1 aOhlrogge, J.B.1 aNeuhaus, H.E.1 aDormann, P.0 tPlanta.g2004 July, v. 219, no. 3 p.389-396x0032-09357nnas  aDNAL  a20040830b20040901c00000000  aINDdRSCe2004/08/23  aNon-US 7aarticle02747naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245012900124300001600253500027100269500002400540520123300564650002101797650001501818650002501833650002001858650002001878650002001898650002401918650002301942650001001965650002101975650002801996650001502024650001902039700001802058700001102076700001502087773014002102852000902242856008602251655001202337IND4464944220221117195247.0130215s2012    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446494422DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTan, K.W.10aDesigned phytochemical synergies for functional foods of the future - ABC transporter-mediated phytochemical bioavailability  ap. 137-152.  aPaper presented at the International Symposium on Emerging Health Topics in Fruits and Vegetables, IHC 2010, Organized on the Occasion of the 28th International Horticultural Congress on Science and Horticulture for People, held August 22-27, 2010, Lisbon, Portugal.  aIncludes references  aA significant driver in food innovation has been the creation of phytochemical-based functional foods to aid health maintenance and disease prevention. Paralleling the growing consumer demand, many functional foods and herbal dietary supplements are now available but few have been subjected to clinical studies and most are sold solely on the basis of in vitro or anecdotal evidence. One major obstacle in translating the in vitro bioactivities of phytochemicals into efficacious consumer products is their limited bioavailability when consumed. Consumed phytochemicals, like drugs, are often regarded as xenobiotics by the body and may undergo extensive pre-systemic metabolism. In addition, phytochemicals can be effluxed back into the gut lumen by ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, which may limit their absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. Similar mechanisms restrict the entry of phytochemicals into target organs. Interestingly, many phytochemicals are able to specifically modulate the transport activity of ABC transporters. Therefore, the opportunity exists to enhance the bioavailability of phytochemicals by designing specific synergistic interactions between phytochemicals targeting ABC transporters. 3aABC transporters 3aabsorption 3abioactive properties 3abioavailability 3aclinical trials 3aconsumer demand 3adietary supplements 3adisease prevention 3adrugs 3afunctional foods 3agastrointestinal system 3ametabolism 3aphytochemicals1 aScheepens, A.1 aLi, Y.1 aPaxton, J.0 tActa horticulturae.g2012 Nov., , no. 939 p.137-152dInternational Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/939/939_17.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02534naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245017100130300001600301500001500317520132300332650002101655650001301676650001601689650002001705650001701725650002301742650002301765650002501788650002901813650001501842650002101857650001801878653000901896700001301905700002001918700001501938700001601953773006501969852000902034930003302043945001302076946001102089655001202100IND2332516320221117195233.0030512e200301  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233251632DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrithiviraj, B.12aA host-specific bacteria-to-plant signal molecular (Nod factor) enhances germination and early growth of diverse crop plants. [Erratum: Mar 2003, v. 216 (5), p. 890.]  ap. 437-445.  a2019-12-05  aLipo-chitooligosaccharides (LCOs), or Nod factors, are host-specific bacteria-to-plant signal molecules essential for the establishment of a successful N2-fixing legume-rhizobia symbiosis. At submicromolar concentrations Nod factors induce physiological changes in host and non-host plants. Here we show that the Nod factor Nod Bj V(C18:1,MeFuc) of Bradyrhizobium japonicum 532C enhances germination of a variety of economically important plants belonging to diverse botanical families: Zea mays, Oryza sativa (Poaceae). Beta vulgaris (Chenopodaceae), Glycine max, Phaseolus vulgaris (Fabaceae), and Gossypium hirsutum (Malvaceae), under laboratory, greenhouse and field conditions. Similar increases in germination were observed for filtrates of genistein-induced cultures of B. japonicum 532C, while non-induced B. japonicum, induced Bj 168 (a nodC mutant of B. japonicum deficient in Nod factor synthesis) or the pentamer of chitin did not invoke such responses, demonstrating the role of Nod factor in the observed effects. In addition, three out of four synthetic LCOs evaluated also promoted germination of corn, soybean and Arabidopsis thaliana seeds. LCO also enhanced the early growth of corn seedlings under greenhouse conditions. These findings suggest the possible use of LCOs for improved crop production. 3aseed germination 3aZea mays 3aGlycine max 3aseedling growth 3aOryza sativa 3aGossypium hirsutum 3aPhaseolus vulgaris 3abiochemical pathways 3aBradyrhizobium japonicum 3aprobiotics 3aoligosaccharides 3aBeta vulgaris 0aBeta1 aZhou, X.1 aSouleimanov, A.1 aKhan, W.M.1 aSmith, D.L.0 tPlanta.g2003 Jan., v. 216, no. 3 p.437-445x0032-09357nnas  aDNAL  a20030801b20030801c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02623naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144072001700161100002100178245011500199300001600314500001500330520132400345650002101669650001301690650001401703650001201717650001901729650003101748650001201779650001401791650002101805650002001826650001701846653001701863700002101880700002501901773007001926852000901996856009102005930003302096945002502129946001102154655001202165IND4430293320221117195258.0091223e200704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443029332DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The pelleted diet had a lower proportion of coarse particles on wet sieving. Birds fed the mash diet had a significantly larger gizzard mass per unit body mass. The gizzards of all birds increased uniformly in size, there being no significant change either in the ratio of content to empty mass or in the ratio of gizzard length to breadth with diet. Thus, there was no tendency for coarse particles to accumulate in the gizzards of bird fed the mash diet. The relative proportion of all classes of particles below 0.500mm was increased and the relative proportion of all particle classes above 0.500mm was reduced in birds regardless of feed form. The relative increase of particles in all classes below 0.500mm was greater in birds fed mash feed. However, digesta exiting the gizzard of birds fed mash diet contained significantly greater amounts of particles of size classes 1mm and greater than digesta of those fed the pelleted diet. Thus, whilst the gizzard operates to generally reduce particle sizes above 0.500mm and increase those below this size, this reduction is not uniform and likely to be a probabilistic function as it is in the human mouth. 3abroiler chickens 3aduodenum 3amash feed 3agizzard 3apelleted feeds 3aparticle size distribution 3adigesta 3adigestion 3afeed formulation 3abroiler feeding 3afeed rations 0afood animals1 aLentle, Roger G.1 aRavindran, Velmurugu0 pJ. poult. scig2007 Apr., v. 44, no. 2 p.175-181x1346-73957nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/browse/jpsa/-char/en/3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100220b20100305c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/01/29  aNon-US 7aarticle03642naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146100001900163245011000182300001600292500001500308520177400323650002602097650002002123650001302143650001002156650002502166650002302191650002502214650001202239650003602251650001602287650000902303650001102312650001902323650002002342650001702362650002102379650001802400650002602418650002502444650002102469650004002490650003802530650003702568650002102605650002802626650002402654650004302678650003702721650001902758653002302777653003402800700001502834773006502849852000902914930003302923945002502956946001102981655001202992IND4363893720221117195502.0040816e200407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436389372DNAL7 a150149942pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aTripathi, B.N.10aRelationship between copper- and zinc-induced oxidative stress and proline accumulation in Scenedesmus sp  ap. 397-404.  a2019-12-05  aA 4-h exposure of Scenedesmus sp. to Cu or Zn enhanced intracellular levels of both test metals and proline. The level of intracellular proline increased markedly up to 10 micromolar Cu, but higher concentrations were inhibitory. However, intracellular proline consistently increased with increasing concentration of Zn in the medium. Cu and Zn induced oxidative stress in the test alga by increasing lipid peroxidation and membrane permeability, and by reducing SH content. Pretreatment of the test alga with 1 mM proline for 30 min completely alleviated Cu-induced lipid peroxidation, minimized K+ efflux and also reduced depletion of the SH pool. But proline pretreatment could only slightly reduce Zn-induced oxidative stress. Interestingly, proline pretreatment increased the level of Cu (25-54%) and Zn (19-49%) inside the cells. It did not affect the activities of superoxide dismutase, ascorbate peroxidase or catalase, but improved glutathione reductase activity under Cu and Zn stress. A comparison of the effects of proline pretreatment on lipid peroxidation by Cu, Zn, methyl viologen and ultraviolet-B radiation suggests that proline protects cells from metal-induced oxidative stress by scavenging reactive oxygen species rather than by chelating metal ions. Pretreatment of cells with a known antioxidant (ascorbate) and a hydroxyl radical scavenger (sodium benzoate) considerably reduced metal-induced lipid peroxidation and proline accumulation. However, sodium benzoate had a very mild effect on Zn-induced lipid peroxidation and proline accumulation. The present study demonstrates that proline possibly acts by detoxifying reactive oxygen species, mainly hydroxyl radicals, rather than by improving the antioxidant defense system under metal stress. 3amembrane permeability 3abioaccumulation 3acatalase 3aalgae 3aascorbate peroxidase 3alipid peroxidation 3asuperoxide dismutase 3aproline 3aglutathione-disulfide reductase 3aScenedesmus 3azinc 3acopper 3acultured cells 3asodium benzoate 3aantioxidants 3aoxidative stress 3aascorbic acid 2aAscorbate Peroxidases 2aCatalasexmetabolism 2aCopperxtoxicity 2aFree Radical Scavengersxmetabolism 2aGlutathione Reductasexmetabolism 2aLipid Peroxidationxdrug effects 2aOxidative Stress 2aPeroxidasesxmetabolism 2aProlinexmetabolism 2aScenedesmusxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aSuperoxide Dismutasexmetabolism 2aZincxtoxicity 0aalgae and seaweeds 0aglutathione reductase (NADPH)1 aGaur, J.P.0 tPlanta.g2004 July, v. 219, no. 3 p.397-404x0032-09357nnas  aDNAL  a20040830b20040901c00000000  aINDdRSCe2004/08/23  aNon-US 7aarticle02495naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100002200161245010500183300001600288520128500304650001501589650001501604650001201619650002601631650002101657650002001678650001701698650001401715650001501729651001101744653001601755653001901771700001901790700001601809700002101825700002501846773009801871852000901969930003301978945002502011946001302036655001202049IND4375910720221117195507.0051109e200506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437591072DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aHeinemann, R.J.B.10aComparative study of nutrient composition of commercial brown, parboiled and milled rice from Brazil  ap. 287-296.  aThe present work aims to compare the chemical composition of commercial samples of brown, parboiled brown, parboiled milled and milled rice, and the contribution of each mineral to the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA). The chemical composition was determined according to official methods and an inductively coupled plasma-based technique was used to analyse the minerals. The results showed protein (Nx5.7) and crude fat contents in all rice forms similar to literature data with some differences in ash contents, mainly between milled samples. Parboiled milled rice showed 18% ash enrichment in comparison with milled rice, and higher contents of K and P. Lower contents of Mn, Ca and Zn were observed, even though contents of other nutritionally important elements were basically similar to milled rice. The brown rice analysed showed concentrations of P, Mn and Na lower than those reported in literature, indicating the usefulness of selecting nutritionally promising varieties for commercial production. Se, Mn, Cu and Zn, reaching 35% of the RDA, depending on the element and the form of rice, presented the highest nutritional contribution. Macroelements, which are the most affected by parboiling and milling, showed a low contribution to the RDA in all forms of rice. 3arough rice 3aparboiling 3amilling 3aproximate composition 3anutrient content 3amineral content 3aOryza sativa 3acultivars 3abrown rice 3aBrazil 0amilled rice 0aparboiled rice1 aFagundes, P.L.1 aPinto, E.A.1 aPenteado, M.V.C.1 aLanfer-Marquez, U.M.0 tSubtropical plant science.g2005 June, v. 18, no. 4 p.287-296wJournal:20855x0485-20447nnas  aDNAL  a20070517b20070602c00000000  aINDdPNNe2005/11/18  aOther US 7aarticle02382naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001500144245008100159300001600240500001500256520129800271650000901569650002301578650001801601650001801619650001501637650002101652650002101673650002301694650001701717653001601734700001901750700001901769773011601788852000901904930003301913945002501946946001301971655001201984IND4375910620200822000000.0051109e200506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437591062DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aWalter, M.10aRice and resistant starch: different content depending on chosen methodology  ap. 279-285.  a2019-12-05  aResistant starch (RS), which is not digested in the small intestine, induces health benefits, as dietary fiber does. Hence, the precise measurement of RS fraction may contribute to identification of functional foods. RS can be measured by using different methodologies. However, current methodologies present some differences, making it difficult to evaluate obtained results. Moreover, parboiling may increase RS levels of rice. Therefore, in the present study, RS fraction of white rice (WR) and parboiled rice (PR) obtained using the AOAC method 996.11 were compared to that obtained using the method by Siljeström and Asp. Results showed that RS values obtained using the AOAC method were similar for WR and PR (4.2±0.7% vs. 4.0±0.2%). However, RS values obtained using the method by Siljeström and Asp were lower for WR when compared to PR (1.5±0.9% vs. 3.8±1.5%). Since parboiling reduced digestible starch fraction (73.9±6.5% vs. 82.4±4.2% for WR), it is reasonable to assume an increase in RS fraction. Thus, RS values obtained using the method by Siljeström and Asp seem more consistent than those obtained using the AOAC method. However, the cause of such discrepancies between the methods deserves further investigation, considering especially the nutritional significance. 3arice 3ain vitro digestion 3adietary fiber 3afood analysis 3aparboiling 3afood composition 3aresistant starch 3aanalytical methods 3ahealth foods 0amethodology1 aSilva, L.P. da1 aDenardin, C.C.0 tJournal of food composition and analysis.g2005 June, v. 18, no. 4 p.279-285wJournal:jnl42192x0889-15757nnas  aDNAL  a20070517b20070602c00000000  aINDdPNNe2005/11/18  aOther US 7aarticle02340naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001500127245009800142300001600240520128300256650001401539650001801553650001901571650002201590650001701612650001601629650001701645650001801662650002601680650005801706700001801764773011601782852000901898930003301907945002501940946001301965655001201978IND4375911220221117195524.0051109e200506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437591122DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aChen, M.H.12aA rapid procedure for analysing rice bran tocopherol, tocotrienol and gamma-oryzanol contents  ap. 319-331.  aTocopherols, tocotrienols and γ-oryzanol compounds are phytochemicals with antioxidant activities and potential health benefits. Their contents and isomer ratios in rice bran vary among southern US cultivars, suggesting that breeding for higher contents or a favorable ratio of these phytochemicals is feasible. Methods that can rapidly and reliably extract and quantify their contents in rice bran or whole rice kernel are necessary for breeding programs. A simple, one-step equilibrium extraction procedure coupled with reversed-phase (RP) HPLC is presented here. The one-min equilibrium extraction at a 1:60 (w/v) ratio of rice bran to methanol recovered 92 to 102% of the target phytochemicals relative to those of repeated, non-saponified, direct solvent extraction methods. At this 1:60 ratio of bran to solvent, isopropanol and methanol are superior extraction solvents relative to hexane. A modified, mobile-phase gradient with 10% of aqueous phase for the first 3-min eliminates all the methanol-soluble interfering compounds. This extraction method has the following advantages over the currently available methods: speed, no special extraction instrumentation is needed; and the extraction solvent, methanol, is compatible with subsequent quantification via RP-HPLC. 3arice bran 3afood analysis 3aphytochemicals 3achemical analysis 3atocotrienols 3atocopherols 3aantioxidants 3afree radicals 3aquantitative analysis 3areversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography1 aBergman, C.J.0 tJournal of food composition and analysis.g2005 June, v. 18, no. 4 p.319-331wJournal:jnl42192x0889-15757nnas  aDNAL  a20100428b20100501c00000000  aINDdPNNe2005/11/18  aOther US 7aarticle02179naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001200144245012500156300001600281520092400297650000901221650001701230650002201247650001201269650002301281650001501304650003101319650002101350650002101371650002601392650002001418651001001438700001301448700001301461700001301474700001301487700001301500700001201513773011601525852000901641930003301650945002501683946001301708655001201721IND4375910920221117195346.0051109e200506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437591092DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aHan, J.10aComparison of nutrient composition of parental rice and rice genetically modified with cowpea trypsin inhibitor in China  ap. 297-302.  aIn order to compare the nutritional composition of parental rice and rice genetically modified (GM) with cowpea trypsin inhibitor (GM rice) that has been developed in China, the nutrient content (moisture, protein and amino acids, fat and carbohydrate, dietary fiber, ash, elements and vitamins) of parental and GM rice was analyzed and compared, using Chinese national standard methods or AOAC methods. The results showed that, except for small differences in fat and fatty acids, there was no significant difference between these two types of rice with respect to most of their nutrient composition. Therefore, we draw a conclusion from this preliminary comparison that the nutritional composition of this GM rice does not change with the insertion of a foreign gene. However, it should undergo further analyses to conclude whether it can meet the requirement of “substantial equivalence” in nutrient composition. 3arice 3aOryza sativa 3atransgenic plants 3acowpeas 3atrypsin inhibitors 3atransgenes 3agenetically modified foods 3afood composition 3anutrient content 3aproximate composition 3aprogeny testing 3aChina1 aYang, Y.1 aChen, S.1 aWang, Z.1 aYang, X.1 aWang, G.1 aMen, J.0 tJournal of food composition and analysis.g2005 June, v. 18, no. 4 p.297-302wJournal:jnl42192x0889-15757nnas  aDNAL  a20070517b20070602c00000000  aINDdPNNe2005/11/18  aOther US 7aarticle01775naa a2200325 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001900115245007000134300001400204300003700218500001500255520087100270650002201141650001301163650001601176650001401192653003501206653003201241653001101273700001901284773007101303852000901374939003301383945000801416946001301424655001201437991618915530742620221117195307.0800103e19790901xx ||||go|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI794569162DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAshton, Robin.10aInstitutions Awards Program: 1979's award-winning kitchen designs  ap. 73-88.  ap. 73-88 (not consecutive). ill.  a2019-12-06  aThe Food Facilities Awards Program sponsored by "Institutions" has spotlighted for 33 years new ideas in layout, equipment selection and use, labor-saving techniques, economy, and aesthetics.

Nitrogen and/or NO3 concentration in fruits and one and two year cladodes were highest for highest N levels. The year effect on fruit quality was higher than conservation treatments effects, reducing fruit firmness and pH, and increasing water losses and fungus decay.

The terms virus- like or phytoplasma- like diseases refer to symptoms of which the underlying pathogen is not known but which resemble the symptoms caused by viruses or phytoplasms. Most diseases are caused by fungi. The diseases often result in severe damage, especially to the cladodes, roots, and fruits, even in the postharvesting period. As some of the diseases can jeopardize the entire cultivation, stricter control should be exercised on propagative material and on importation from other countries. Prevention is often the best way to control the diseases and keep them from spreading into areas that are not affected. This paper reports on the major cactus pear diseases present in the growing areas, the characteristics of the causal agent, the symptomatology and the control measures. 3aOpuntia ficus-indica 3abacteria 3acactus pears 3acladodes 3acontrol methods 3adisease control 3afruits 3apathogens 3aroots 3asurveys 3aviruses 3ayeasts1 aSidoti, A.0 tActa horticulturae.g2002 Aug., , no. 581 p.231-237dInternational Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/581/581_24.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02730naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002400110245003800134300001600172500013200188500002400320520134900344650001201693650001901705650001701724650001301741650000901754650001001763650001301773650001001786650002101796650001801817650001401835650002701849650001301876650001601889651002201905651001101927700002301938700002401961700002601985700002602011773014002037852000902177856008602186655001202272IND4464950520221117195146.0130220s2002    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446495052DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aValdez-Cepeda, R.D.10aFreezing tolerance of Opuntia spp  ap. 177-183.  aPaper presented at the Fourth International Congress on Cactus Pear and Cochineal, held October 22-28, 2000, Hammamet, Tunisia.  aIncludes references  aFrost is a serious abiotic stress affecting crops in the Chihuahuan desert. A frost occurred incidentally in 11-14 December 1997, and caused serious injuries in the Opuntia spp. commercial orchards for nochtli, tuna or cactus pear fruit production in the Mexico’s State of Zacatecas and at the “Centro Regional Universitario of the Universidad Autónoma Chapingo germplasm collection”. In a set of 73 taxonomic varieties (five plants each) of Opuntia spp. from such germplasm bank an evaluation of resistance to freezing was carried out. The percent of dead cladodes (%DC) in each plant, as experimental unit, was the variable under study. As a result, data of μ ± σ of %DC are presented and discussed. The varieties “Tapón Aguanoso” and “Duraznillo” were not affected by freezing; “Amarilla CE”, “Amarilla SM”, “Morada SM”, “Camuezo” and “Zarquita” were only mildly affected (0-10 %DC), i.e. these varieties (together with “Tapón Aguanoso” and “Duraznillo”) showed the highest values of cold hardiness related to the plant's ability to withstand cold temperatures without serious injury. All other varieties were seriously affected with Copena varieties showing the greatest damage. These findings are useful on crop research and improvement programs processed on Opuntia spp. freezing tolerance. 3aOpuntia 3aabiotic stress 3acactus pears 3acladodes 3acold 3acrops 3afreezing 3afrost 3afrost resistance 3afruit growing 3agermplasm 3agermplasm conservation 3aorchards 3atemperature 3aChihuahuan Desert 3aMexico1 aBlanco-Macías, F.1 aSalinas-García, G.1 aVázquez-Alvarado, R.1 aGallegos-Vázquez, C.0 tActa horticulturae.g2002 Aug., , no. 581 p.177-183dInternational Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/581/581_16.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02416naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003000150245007800180300001800258520105400276650001401330650001301344650002001357650001301377650002301390650002801413650001001441650001301451650001501464650001401479650001201493650001901505650005201524650001501576650001201591651001101603700002801614700003001642700003201672700003201704773017401736856005101910852000901961655001201970IND60408780020221117195232.0150922s2014    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6040878002DNAL7 a10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-13-4262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQuiroz-Santiago, Carolina10aRotavirus G2P[4] Detection in Fresh Vegetables and Oysters in Mexico City  ap. 1953-1959.  aRotaviruses are the principal cause of dehydration caused by diarrhea in children younger than 2 years of age. Although these viral infections have mainly been associated with ingestion of fecally contaminated food and water, few studies have addressed the presence of the virus in food that is consumed raw or slightly cooked. In this work, 30 oyster samples and 33 vegetable samples were examined for the presence of rotavirus genotypes to evaluate their potential to produce gastrointestinal infections. The rotaviruses were identified by reverse transcriptase PCR amplification of the VP7 gene. G and P genotyping was also performed by reverse transcriptase PCR, with a detection sensitivity of up to 15 PFU/ml. Rotaviruses were found in 17 (26.9%) of 63 samples (10 oysters and 7 vegetables). The G2 genotype was found in 11 (64.7%) of 17 of the rotavirus strains, and 16 (94.1%) of 17 had the P[4] genotype. The combined genotypes found most frequently were G2P[4] (10 [58.82%] of 17), GNTP[4] (6 [35.29%] of 17), and G2P[NT] (1 [5.8%] of 17). 3aRotavirus 3achildren 3adetection limit 3adiarrhea 3afood contamination 3agastrointestinal system 3agenes 3agenotype 3agenotyping 3aingestion 3aoysters 3araw vegetables 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3avegetables 3aviruses 3aMexico1 aVazquez-Salinas, Carlos1 aNatividad-Bonifacio, Ivan1 aBarron-Romero, Blanca Lilia1 aQuinones-Ramirez, Elsa Irma0 tJournal of food protection.g2014 Nov., v. 77, no. 11 p.1953-1959dInternational Association of Milk, Food, and Environmental Sanitarians.wJournal:2024x0362-028X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-13-426  aDNAL 7aarticle01836naa a2200289 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001800115245004900133300001400182300001900196520107600215650001401291650001701305650001201322650002301334650001501357653002701372773007201399852000901471930003301480945000801513946001301521655001201534991618913410742620221117195036.0830628e19820615xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI830019202DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHolden, Chet.10aBreakfast menu workbook: The breakfast trade  ap. 39-42.  ap. 39-42. ill.  aThe relative role and growth of breakfast in the foodservice industry are reviewed. From 1978-1981, breakfast outpaced all other meals with an average growth of 13%. Breakfast had a growth of 8% during 1980-81, while lunch and dinner increased only 2% and snacks declined 1%. In a 1982 survey, 25% of respondents said that they planned to eat breakfast out more, while 19% said they would eat breakfast out less. However, for 1983, only 14% said they would eat breakfast out more, while 18% said less. Restaurant reputation ranked second to friends' recommendations in the selection of eating establishments. The majority of people rated breakfast as a better cost-benefit value than lunch and dinner. The top 3 items on the 1982 breakfast menu were scrambled eggs, toast, and bacon, while sweet rolls fared well for abbreviated breakfasts in hotels and university foodservices. Orange juice led the juice listings (67.3% on menu), with colleges and universities representing the best foodservice sector. Interest in grains for foodservice breakfasts also increased.

In order to improve our knowledge, field investigations and modelling approaches for the entire area of the city of Halle/Saale, Germany, were performed. The distribution of the concentration values and mass fluxes are exemplified using indicators such as Bisphenol A, t-Nonylphenol, Carbamacepine, Galaxolide, Tonalide, Gadolinium and isotopes. Concentrations at a magnitude of ng/L to μg/L were found ubiquitously in the ground and surface waters. Using the concentration values, the impact of the city concerning the indicators was not always evident. Only the assessment of the mass fluxes shows significant urban impacts along the city passage. The calculation of the mass fluxes shows increasing values for all investigated xenobiotics during the city passage; only Bisphenol A stagnates. A balance model of water and indicator mass fluxes was built up for the entire city area. Xenobiotics are ubiquitous in the investigated urban aquatic system and are quantified by a large scale mass balance to find spatial trends. 3aendocrine-disrupting chemicals 3axenobiotics 3agroundwater contamination 3adrugs 3aspatial distribution 3apersonal care products 3acities 2aBenzhydryl Compounds 2aBenzopyransxanalysis 2aCarbamazepinexanalysis 2aCities 2aEnvironmental Monitoringxmethods 2aGadoliniumxanalysis 2aGadolinium DTPAxanalysis 2aIsotopesxanalysis 2aModels, Theoretical 2aPhenolsxanalysis 2aRivers 2aTetrahydronaphthalenesxanalysis 2aWater Movements 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysis 2aWater Pollution 2aXenobiotics 0aGermany 0aGermany 0awater pollution1 aStrauch, G.1 aSchirmer, K.1 aGläser, H.R.1 aMöder, M.1 aWennrich, R.1 aOsenbrück, K.1 aSchirmer, M.0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2008 Mar., v. 152, no. 2 p.452-460dElsevier Applied Science Publishersx0269-74917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2007.05.0333Available from publisher's Web site  a20080508b20080606c00000000  aINDdGAYe2008/05/08  aNon-US 7aarticle02790naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149072000900167072000900176072000900185100001600194245013300210300001600343500002400359520124600383650002001629650001201649650001101661650003501672650001201707650001401719650002501733650003501758650003801793650004101831650002201872650001101894650000901905650002001914650004101934651001201975651001201987773011901999852000902118856008802127930003302215945002502248946001102273655001202284IND4403602520221117195107.0080328e200803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440360252DNAL7 a176982682pmid7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2007.05.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW000 0aP300 0aP2001 aQuednow, K.10aEndocrine disruptors in freshwater streams of Hesse, Germany: Changes in concentration levels in the time span from 2003 to 2005  ap. 476-483.  aIncludes references  aFour small freshwater streams in the region known as Hessisches Ried in Germany were investigated with respect to the temporal and spatial concentration variations of the endocrine disruptors bisphenol A (BPA), 4-tert-octylphenol (4-tert-OP), and the technical isomer mixture of 4-nonylphenol (tech.-4-NP). Measured concentrations of the target compounds in the river water samples ranged from <20 ng/l to 1927 ng/l, <10 ng/l to 770 ng/l, and <10 ng/l to 420 ng/l for BPA, 4-tert-OP and tech.-4-NP, respectively. BPA levels were, with the exception of two samples, below the predicted no-effect concentration (PNEC) for water organisms. Tech.-4-NP concentrations showed a significant tendency of decreasing concentrations during the sampling period. This is mainly attributed to the implementation of the European Directive 2003/53/EG, which restricts both the marketing and use of nonylphenols. Results from the analysis of additionally collected water samples from sewage treatment plant (STP) effluents indicate that the STPs cannot be the only sources for tech.-4-NP found in the river water. Concentrations of 4-nonylphenols in rivers of Hessisches Ried in Germany decreased in the sampling period from September 2003 to September 2005. 3awater pollution 3astreams 3arivers 3aendocrine-disrupting chemicals 3aphenols 3aestrogens 2aBenzhydryl Compounds 2aEndocrine Disruptorsxanalysis 2aEnvironmental Monitoringxmethods 2aGas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry 2aPhenolsxanalysis 2aRivers 2aTime 2aWater Movements 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysis 3aGermany 0aGermany0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2008 Mar., v. 152, no. 2 p.476-483dElsevier Applied Science Publishersx0269-74917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2007.05.0323Available from publisher's Web site  a20080508b20080606c00000000  aINDdGAYe2008/05/08  aNon-US 7aarticle03284naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151100002000169245011800189300001800307500002400325520142500349650003301774650002101807650001401828650001101842650001601853650001201869650002201881650001801903650001101921650001401932650001501946650002201961650002901983650000902012650001802021650002502039650002502064650003402089650001302123650002502136650002202161650003202183650001402215650001802229650001602247650002302263650003102286650003102317650003502348650002602383650002602409650001702435700001702452700001802469773009702487852000902584856005302593655001202646IND4402069220221117195622.0080227e200804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440206922DNAL7 a174828122pmid7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2007.03.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Chien-Hung10aDiffusion characteristics and controlled release of bacterial fertilizers from modified calcium alginate capsules  ap. 1904-1910.  aIncludes references  aAn indigenous Cellulosimicrobium cellulans GS6 isolate able to solubilize insoluble phosphate complexes in soil is a potential bacterial fertilizer. Enclosure of the phosphate-solubilizing bacterium (PSB) in biodegradable capsules may protect the PSB cells inoculated into soil and, in the meantime, enable the control of cell release that confers long-term fertilizing effects. In this study, calcium alginate (CA) was used as the core matrix to encapsulate cells of C. cellulans GS6. The cell-liberating properties of the CA-based capsules were modified by blending with a variety of supplemental materials (SM), including chitin, cellulose, olive oil, and gelatin. The experimental results showed that the maximum cell-release percentage (MCR%) of the capsules decreased in the order of CA-cellulose>CA-olive oil>CA-chitin>CA-gelatin>CA. Furthermore, a mass transport model was developed to accurately describe the kinetics of cell release results for each capsule. The diffusion coefficient (D e) of each capsule was also determined from the model simulation. We found that the estimated D e values are positively correlated to the release rate with rare exceptions. Lastly, as our results underscored the crucial roles that the type of capsules plays in the rate and amount of cell release, controlled release of the bacterial fertilizer (C. cellulans GS6 cells) may be achieved via the design of capsule materials. 3aCellulosimicrobium cellulans 3acalcium alginate 3acellulose 3achitin 3adiffusivity 3agelatin 3along term effects 3amass transfer 3amixing 3aolive oil 3aphosphates 3asimulation models 3aslow-release fertilizers 3asoil 3asoil bacteria 2aAlginatesxchemistry 2aBacteriaxmetabolism 2aBiodegradation, Environmental 2aCapsules 2aCellulosexchemistry 2aChitinxchemistry 2aDelayed-Action Preparations 2aDiffusion 2aFertilization 2aFertilizers 2aGelatinxchemistry 2aGlucuronic Acidxchemistry 2aHexuronic Acidsxchemistry 2aMicroscopy, Electron, Scanning 2aPhosphatesxchemistry 2aPlant Oilsxchemistry 2aTime Factors1 aWu, Jane-Yii1 aChang, Jo-Shu0 tBioresource technology.g2008 Apr., v. 99, no. 6 p.1904-1910dElsevier Ltd.x0960-85247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2007.03.029 7aarticle03182naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149072000900167072000900176072000900185100001900194245013600213300001600349500002400365520127800389650002201667650002201689650001701711650001001728650001801738650002501756650001901781650002301800650002201823650002301845650001701868650002701885650004901912650003101961650002101992650001602013650003802029650002302067650003802090650002002128650001702148650002402165650001202189651001802201651001602219700001802235700001802253773011902271852000902390856008802399930003302487945002502520946001102545655001202556IND4403601220221117195615.0080328e200803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440360122DNAL7 a176559892pmid7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2007.06.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW000 0aF600 0aF8411 aBergweiler, C.10aSeasonal and diurnal gas exchange differences in ozone-sensitive common milkweed (Asclepias syriaca L.) in relation to ozone uptake  ap. 403-415.  aIncludes references  aStomatal conductance and net photosynthesis of common milkweed (Asclepias syriaca L.) plants in two different soil moisture regimes were directly quantified and subsequently modeled over an entire growing season. Direct measurements captured the dynamic response of stomatal conductance to changing environmental conditions throughout the day, as well as declining gas exchange and carbon assimilation throughout the growth period beyond an early summer maximum. This phenomenon was observed in plants grown both with and without supplemental soil moisture, the latter of which should theoretically mitigate against harmful physiological effects caused by exposure to ozone. Seasonally declining rates of stomatal conductance were found to be substantial and incorporated into models, making them less susceptible to the overestimations of effective exposure that are an inherent source of error in ozone exposure indices. The species-specific evidence presented here supports the integration of dynamic physiological processes into flux-based modeling approaches for the prediction of ozone injury in vegetation. Temporal variation in physiological processes underlying diurnal and seasonal ozone uptake are described for a key ozone bioindicator species of North America. 3aAsclepias syriaca 3aindicator species 3agas exchange 3aozone 3aair pollution 3astomatal conductance 3aphotosynthesis 3asoil water regimes 3adiurnal variation 3aseasonal variation 3aplant damage 3aphysiological response 2aAsclepiasxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aCarbon Dioxidexmetabolism 2aCircadian Rhythm 2aDehydration 2aEnvironmental Monitoringxmethods 2aModels, Biological 2aOxidants, Photochemicalxtoxicity 2aOzonextoxicity 2aPlant Leaves 2aPlant Transpiration 2aSeasons 3aMassachusetts 0aNew England1 aManning, W.J.1 aChevone, B.I.0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2008 Mar., v. 152, no. 2 p.403-415dElsevier Applied Science Publishersx0269-74917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2007.06.0193Available from publisher's Web site  a20080508b20080606c00000000  aINDdGAYe2008/05/08  aNon-US 7aarticle03399naa a2200721 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129100001700146245006400163300001800227500001500245520146000260650002001720650001601740650001601756650001401772650001101786650001801797650001901815650002301834650001301857650002001870650001701890650001101907650001301918650002001931650000901951650001701960650005101977650002102028650001302049650002102062650001102083650001102094650001002105650001702115650004802132650001602180650002202196650002602218650001002244651001102254651001102265653001802276653001502294700002302309700002002332700002302352700002902375700001902404700002202423700002602445773011402471852000902585930003302594945002502627946001302652655001202665IND4382950220221117195603.0060820e200609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438295022DNAL7 a169208562pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aBrat, Pierre10aDaily Polyphenol Intake in France from Fruit and Vegetables  ap. 2368-2373.  a2019-12-05  aThe objective of this study was to create a French database on the polyphenol content of fruit and vegetables as uncooked fruits and vegetables and then to evaluate polyphenol intake through fruit and vegetable consumption in France. To achieve this, we used the Folin-Ciocalteu method adapted to fruit and vegetable polyphenol quantitation (1). Vegetables with the highest polyphenol concentration were artichokes, parsley, and brussels sprouts [>250 mg of gallic acid equivalent (GAE)/100 g fresh edible portion (FEP)]; fruits with the highest concentrations were strawberries, lychees, and grapes (>180 mg of GAE/100 g FEP). Conversely, melons (Cantaloupe cv.) and avocados had the lowest polyphenol concentration for fruits and vegetables, respectively. Based on fruit consumption data, apples and strawberries are the main sources of polyphenols in the French diet, whereas potatoes, lettuces, and onions are the most important vegetable sources. Total polyphenol intake from fruit is about 3 times higher than from vegetables, due to the lower polyphenol concentration in vegetables. The calculation of polyphenol intake, based on both assessment methods used [(Société d'Études de la Communication, Distribution et Publicité (SECODIP) and Supplémentation en Vitamines et Minéraux Antioxydants (SUVIMAX)], showed that apples and potatoes provide approximatively half of the total polyphenol intake from fruit and vegetables in the French diet. 3anutrient intake 3apolyphenols 3afood intake 3araw fruit 3aapples 3aeating habits 3araw vegetables 3anutrient databanks 3apotatoes 3ahuman nutrition 3afood records 2aAllium 2aBrassica 2aCynara scolymus 2aDiet 2aDiet Records 2aFlavonoidsxadministration & dosagexanalysis. 2aFood Preferences 2aFragaria 2aFruitxchemistry 2aHumans 2aLitchi 2aMalus 2aPetroselinum 2aPhenolsxadministration & dosagexanalysis. 2aPolyphenols 2aSolanum tuberosum 2aVegetablesxchemistry 2aVitis 3aFrance 0aFrance 0afruits (food) 0avegetables1 aGeorgé, Stéphane1 aBellamy, Annick1 aChaffaut, Laure Du1 aScalbert, A.q(Augustin)1 aMennen, Louise1 aArnault, Nathalie1 aAmiot, Marie Josèphe0 tJournal of nutrition.g2006 Sept., v. 136, no. 9 p.2368-2373dAmerican Society for Nutritionx0022-31667nnas  aDNAL  a20061108b20061202c00000000  aINDd3CTe2006/10/31  aOther US 7aarticle03759naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146100001600163245011000179300001800289520161400307650002501921650001601946650001401962650001801976650002301994650002302017650000902040650002302049650001302072650001702085650003202102650002202134650001802156650002102174650002202195650001202217650002502229650002802254650004302282650003902325650003202364650001602396650004402412650003902456650001102495650002802506650003202534650000902566650002402575650002102599650003902620650003902659650003702698700001502735700001402750700001802764700001502782700002302797700002302820773011402843852000902957930003302966945002502999946001303024655001203037IND4382950620221117195159.0060820e200609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438295062DNAL7 a169208602pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aZhang, Ping10aDietary Fish Oil Inhibits Antigen-Specific Murine Th1 Cell Development by Suppression of Clonal Expansion  ap. 2391-2398.  aTo determine the mechanisms by which dietary fish oil (FO) affects antigen-stimulated Th1 cell development, DO11.10 Rag 2⁻/⁻ T cell receptor transgenic mice were fed a control diet (5% corn oil (CO) or a FO diet (1% CO + 4% FO, (n-3) PUFA) for 2 wk. CD4⁺ T cells were cultured under neutral or Th1 polarizing conditions. FO feeding suppressed (P < 0.05) ovalbumin peptide-induced proliferation of nonpolarized CD4⁺ T cells. Differentiation in vitro to Th1 cells was not affected by dietary FO, as evidenced by similar percentages of KJ1-26⁺, IFN-γ⁺, IL-4⁻ Th1 cells in cultures from CO-fed (99%) and FO-fed (97%) mice. However, the absolute number of viable Th1 cells in polarized cultures from FO-fed mice was less than half that observed in CO-fed mice (P < 0.05), indicating that FO inhibits in vitro Th1 clonal expansion. The reduced number of Th1 cells in FO cultures was not a result of increased apoptosis, because similar percentages of apoptotic Th1 cells were observed in cultures from FO- and CO-fed mice. IL-2-induced cell proliferation was significantly decreased in polarized Th1 cells from the FO group; however, the suppressed proliferation was not linked to reduced CD25 surface expression on antigen-stimulated CD4⁺ T cells. Adoptively transferred CFSE-labeled DO11.10 CD4⁺ cells into immunized mice (Th1 polarizing agents) showed that dietary FO reduced (P < 0.05) the number of cell divisions in vivo. These studies suggest that the attenuated inflammatory response which accompanies FO feeding may be explained, at least in part, by suppression of Th1 clonal expansion. 3anutrition physiology 3adietary fat 3afish oils 3aanimal models 3acell proliferation 3aexperimental diets 3amice 3atransgenic animals 3aantigens 3ainflammation 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 3aprotective effect 3aT-lymphocytes 3aimmunomodulators 2aAdoptive Transfer 2aAnimals 2aAntigensximmunology 2aApoptosisxdrug effects 2aCD4-Positive T-Lymphocytesximmunology 2aCell Differentiationxdrug effects 2aCell Divisionxdrug effects 2aClone Cells 2aDietary Fats, Unsaturatedxpharmacology 2aFatty Acids, Omega-3xpharmacology 2aFemale 2aFish Oilsxpharmacology 2aInterleukin-2xpharmacology 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred BALB C 2aMice, Transgenic 2aReceptors, Interleukin-2xanalysis 2aRecombinant Proteinsxpharmacology 2aTh1 Cellsxcytologyximmunology.1 aKim, Wooki1 aZhou, Lan1 aWang, Naisyin1 aLy, Lan H.1 aMcMurray, David N.1 aChapkin, Robert S.0 tJournal of nutrition.g2006 Sept., v. 136, no. 9 p.2391-2398dAmerican Society for Nutritionx0022-31667nnas  aDNAL  a20061108b20061202c00000000  aINDd3CTe2006/10/31  aOther US 7aarticle01903naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002300145245011100168300001600279520075800295650001801053650002301071650002501094650002001119653000901139653002001148700002901168700002701197700002401224700002801248700002201276773010501298852000901403856008501412930003301497946001101530655001201541IND4436372820221117195203.0100430e201004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443637282DNAL7 a10.1007/s10228-009-0145-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade A.

Subjects (n = 4) were 247 ± 30 d postpartum, weighed 70.8 ± 3.7 kg, breast-fed at least 6 times/d and consumed self-selected diets. After an overnight fast, they consumed the ¹³C-VA (2.5 mg/kg body wt). Milk samples were obtained by complete breast expression at 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, 18, 24, and 48 h post-¹³C-VA ingestion. Lipid was extracted using chloroform:methanol. Fatty acids were methylated and converted to dimethyl disulfide and Diels-Alder derivatives before analysis by gas chromatography mass spectrometry. The mean ¹³C-enrichment of milk VA was 3.1% at 8 h and reached maximal enrichment of 7.6% at 18 h. The ¹³C enrichment of milk cis-9, trans-11 CLA reached a maximum of 0.4% at 18 h, confirming its conversion of VA to the Δ9-desaturase enzyme product. In the subjects examined, a portion (<10%) of the cis-9, trans-11 CLA present in milk was endogenously synthesized from VA. 3anutrition physiology 3aconjugated linoleic acid 3avaccenic acid 3alactating women 3amaternal nutrition 3aexperimental diets 3aendogenous sources 3abiotransformation 3aenzyme activity 3asynthesis 2aCarbon Isotopesxdiagnostic use. 2aCholesterol Estersxmetabolism 2aDiet 2aDiet Records 2aFatty Acidsxmetabolism 2aFemale 2aGas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry 2aHumans 2aKinetics 2aLactation 2aLinoleic Acids, Conjugatedxanalysisxbiosynthesisxblood. 2aLipidsxblood 2aMethylation 2aMilk, Humanxchemistry 2aOleic Acidsxdiagnostic usexmetabolism. 2aPhospholipidsxblood 2aTriglyceridesxblood 0acis-9, trans-11 conjugated linoleic acid1 aMcGuire, Michelle K.1 aWilliams, Janet E.1 aMcGuire, Mark A.0 tJournal of nutrition.g2006 Sept., v. 136, no. 9 p.2297-2301dAmerican Society for Nutritionx0022-31667nnas  aDNAL  a20061109b20061202c00000000  aINDd3CTe2006/10/31  aOther US 7aarticle03185naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245011900168300001600287520208000303650002102383650001202404650000902416650002202425650002002447650001902467650002202486650001302508650002802521700001802549700001802567700001902585773017102604856005102775852000902826655001202835IND60408796120221117195140.0150923s2015    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6040879612DNAL7 a10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-14-2262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Xianqin10aMicrobiological Effects of a Routine Treatment for Decontaminating Hide-On Carcasses at a Large Beef Packing Plant  ap. 256-263.  aTo investigate the microbiological effects of a hide-on carcass decontaminating treatment recently implemented at a beef packing plant, carcasses undergoing routine processing at the plant were sampled during successive periods in January/February, April/May, and September/October. During each period, samples were collected from carcasses before and after the decontamination of hide-on carcasses, after skinning, before decontamination of the skinned carcasses, and at the end of the carcass dressing process. At each stage of processing during each period, samples were obtained by swabbing an area of 1,000 cm(2) on each of 25 carcasses. Aerobes, coliforms, and Escherichia coli were enumerated. In most samples, coliforms were predominantly E. coli. In all three periods, the log mean numbers of aerobes and E. coli recovered from hides before decontamination were between 6.6 and 6.8 and between 5.3 and 5.9 log CFU/1,000 cm(2), respectively. The log mean numbers of aerobes recovered from decontaminated hides were 6.6 log CFU/1,000 cm(2) in January/February and April/May but 5.4 log CFU/1,000 cm(2) in September/October. The log total numbers of E. coli recovered from decontaminated hides in January/February and April/May were 2.4 and 3.8 log CFU/25,000 cm(2), respectively, but no E. coli was recovered from such carcasses in September/October. Log total numbers of aerobes and E. coli recovered from skinned or dressed carcasses were mostly >4 and between 1 and 2 log CFU/25,000 cm(2), respectively. Typing of 480 E. coli isolates by multiple-locus variable-number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) identified 218 MLVA types. Most isolates recovered from carcasses in different periods or at different stages of processing were of different MLVA types. However, small numbers of MLVA types were recovered in more than one period or from both hides before and after decontamination and skinned or dressed carcasses. The findings show that the hide-decontaminating treatment disrupted the usual transfer of E. coli from hides to meat surfaces during carcass skinning. 3aEscherichia coli 3aaerobes 3abeef 3acoliform bacteria 3adecontamination 3ameat carcasses 3aprocessing stages 3askinning 3atandem repeat sequences1 aBadoni, Madhu1 aTran, Frances1 aGill, Colin O.0 tJournal of food protection.g2015 Feb., v. 78, no. 2 p.256-263dInternational Association of Milk, Food, and Environmental Sanitarians.wJournal:2024x0362-028X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-14-226  aDNAL 7aarticle02655naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149100001900158245014500177300001600322500002400338520108500362650002301447650001701470650002001487650001501507650001201522650001101534650002501545650002501570650003301595650002301628650002101651650002101672650001301693650001101706650001201717653001901729700001601748700002501764700001901789773018601808852000901994856008902003930003302092945002502125946001102150655001202161IND4403622820221117195206.0080328s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440362282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2007.11.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ1001 aChambi, H.N.M.10aSolid lipid microparticles containing water-soluble compounds of different molecular mass: Production, characterisation and release profiles  ap. 229-236.  aIncludes references  aSolid lipid microparticles were produced by spray chilling using mixtures of stearic acid with lauric acid or with oleic acid, sorbitan tristearate and solutions of glucose or casein or hydrolysed casein. Response used to identify the best conditions for glucose retention was the time for 50% release of the core material, 120-min trials for release into water. The smallest and the greatest retention time conditions were then used for encapsulating casein or hydrolysed casein. The incorporation efficiency, morphology, mean diameter and release behaviour were evaluated. The mean diameters presented no significant differences considering treatment and type of core material. Incorporation efficiency was higher for particles containing casein or hydrolysed casein. Microparticles were spherical and wrinkled. Stearic/oleic matrix was more efficient in retaining glucose than stearic/lauric. For the microparticles containing casein or hydrolysed casein, less release was observed from the stearic/lauric matrix. Release of the hydrolysed casein was higher compared to casein. 3amodel food systems 3astearic acid 3adodecanoic acid 3aoleic acid 3aglucose 3acasein 3aprotein hydrolysates 3afood nutrient losses 3aresponse surface methodology 3amicroencapsulation 3awater solubility 3amolecular weight 3adiameter 3amixing 3acooling 0amicroparticles1 aAlvim, I.D.1 aBarrera-Arellano, D.1 aGrosso, C.R.F.0 tFood research international.g2008, v. 41, no. 3 p.229-236dPublished on behalf of the Canadian Institute of Food Science and Technology by Elsevier Applied Sciencex0963-99697nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2007.11.0123Available from publisher's Web site  a20080702b20080801c00000000  aINDdPNNe2008/07/01  aNon-US 7aarticle01392naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245010000163300001600263520042300279653002600702653002300728700001300751700002100764700001500785700001700800700002100817773010000838852000900938856008500947930003301032946001301065655001201078IND4437102820221117195141.0100514e201006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443710282DNAL7 a10.1007/s10562-009-0131-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Tianbo 14aThe Synthesis of Novel Hierarchical Zeolites and Their Performances in Cracking Large Molecules  ap. 266-270.  aNovel hierarchical zeolites with continuous micrometer-scale macropores and mesopores other than popular nanometer-scale mesopores and micropores were synthesized by transforming the skeletons of the silica monolith into zeolites through both the steam-assisted conversion and nanocasting methods.

We employ a test-retest strategy using two large sample normative databases (N = 57 and 84). Using a BSS method in the complex Fourier domain, we show that we can rigourously study the out-of-phase dependence of the extracted components, albeit they are extracted so as to be in-phase independent (by BSS definition). Our focus on lagged communication between components effectively yields dependence measures unbiased by volume conduction effects, which is a major concern about the validity of any dependence measures issued by EEG measurements. We are able to show the organization of the extracted components in two networks. Within each network components oscillate coherently with multiple-frequency dynamics, whereas between networks they exchange information at non-random multiple time-lag rates. 0aBlind source separation (BSS) 0aIndependent component analysis (ICA) 0aConnectivity 0aIn-phase coherence 0aOut-of-phase coherence1 aJohn, Roy E. 1 aRidder, Dirk De.1 aPrichep, Leslie 1 aIsenhart, Robert 0 tBrain topography.g2010 June, v. 23, no. 2 p.134-138dBoston : Springer USx0896-02677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10548-009-0113-63Available from publisher's Web site  a20100522b20100605c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02454naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245018100126300001800307500002800325520118000353650001701533650002501550650002101575650001101596650001401607650001801621650001801639650001001657650001101667650001401678650001701692650001401709700001501723700001501738700001901753700001701772700001501789700001301804700001701817700001501834700001601849773010901865852000901974946001301983655001201996IND4414388720221117195537.0090102s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441438872DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Yanchun10aIndependent Losses of Function in a Polyphenol Oxidase in Rice: Differentiation in Grain Discoloration between Subspecies and the Role of Positive Selection under Domestication  ap. 2946-2959.  aPublisher supplied data  aAsian rice (Oryza sativa) cultivars originated from wild rice and can be divided into two subspecies by several criteria, one of which is the phenol reaction (PHR) phenotype. Grains of indica cultivars turn brown in a phenol solution that accelerates a similar process that occurs during prolonged storage. By contrast, the grains of japonica do not discolor. This distinction may reflect the divergent domestication of these two subspecies. The PHR is controlled by a single gene, Phr1; here, we report the cloning of Phr1, which encodes a polyphenol oxidase. The Phr1 gene is indeed responsible for the PHR phenotype, as transformation with a functional Phr1 can complement a PHR negative cultivar. Phr1 is defective in all japonica lines but functional in nearly all indica and wild strains. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the defects in Phr1 arose independently three times. The multiple recent origins and rapid spread of phr1 in japonica suggest the action of positive selection, which is further supported by several population genetic tests. This case may hence represent an example of artificial selection driving the differentiation among domesticated varieties. 3aOryza sativa 3aartificial selection 3acatechol oxidase 3aclones 3acultivars 3adiscoloration 3adomestication 3agenes 3aphenol 3aphylogeny 3astorage time 3awild rice1 aTang, Tian1 aQian, Qian1 aWang, Yonghong1 aYan, Meixian1 aZeng, Dali1 aHan, Bin1 aWu, Chung -I1 aShi, Suhua1 aLi, Jiayang0 tPlant cell.g2008 Nov., v. 20, no. 11 p.2946-2959dAmerican Society of Plant Biologistsx1040-46517nnas  aDNAL  aOther US 7aarticle02492naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002400145245011200169300001600281520131600297650001301613650001201626650001001638650001901648650002301667650001501690653001501705653003601720653001301756653002001769700002101789700002101810700001901831773011801850852000901968856008501977930003302062946001102095655001202106IND4435586320221117195451.0100416e201005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443558632DNAL7 a10.1007/s10546-010-9474-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartucci, Giovanni 10aFrequency of Boundary-Layer-Top Fluctuations in Convective and Stable Conditions Using Laser Remote Sensing  ap. 313-331.  aThe planetary boundary-layer (PBL) height is determined with high temporal and altitude resolution from lidar backscatter profiles. Then, the frequencies of daytime thermal updrafts and downdrafts and of nighttime gravity waves are obtained applying a fast Fourier transform on the temporal fluctuation of the PBL height. The principal frequency components of each spectrum are related to the dominant processes occurring at the daytime and nighttime PBL top. Two groups of cases are selected for the study: one group combines daytime cases, measured in weak horizontal wind conditions and dominated by convection. The cases show higher updraft and downdraft frequencies for the shallow, convective boundary layer and lower frequencies for a deep PBL. For cases characterized by strong horizontal winds, the frequencies directly depend on the wind speed. The temporal variation of the PBL height is determined also in the likely presence of lee waves. For nighttime cases, the main frequency components in the spectra do not show a real correlation with the nocturnal PBL height. Altitude fluctuations of the top of the nocturnal boundary layer are observed even though the boundary layer is statically stable. These oscillations are associated with the wind shear effect and with buoyancy waves at the PBL top. 3aaltitude 3agravity 3alidar 3aremote sensing 3atemporal variation 3awind speed 0aConvection 0aPlanetary boundary-layer height 0aThermals 0aTop oscillation1 aMatthey, Renaud 1 aMitev, Valentin 1 aRichner, Hans 0 tBoundary-layer meteorology.g2010 May, v. 135, no. 2 p.313-331dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0006-83147nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10546-010-9474-33Available from publisher's Web site  a20100416b20100501c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02730naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145100001800154245008600172300001600258500002400274520154600298650001801844650001401862650002101876650002701897650002801924650002601952650002001978650002301998700001602021700002302037773011902060852000902179856008502188930003302273945002502306946001302331655001202344IND4403693020221117195534.0080328e200805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440369302DNAL7 a10.1007/s11746-008-1213-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aS2001 aLiang, Baomin10aCorrelation of Rheological and Microstructural Properties in a Model Lipid System  ap. 397-404.  aIncludes references  aModel systems having different microstructures and rheological properties were obtained by controlled crystallization from a mixture of high-melting and low-melting lipids. Based on analysis of confocal scanning light microscopic images, the microstructural characteristics of the systems were quantified by use of different approaches including microstructure density, Euler characteristic, nearest-neighbor analysis, fractal dimension of microstructure interface, and fractal dimension by the particle-counting method (PCM). The solid-fat content (SFC) of semisolid lipid samples was measured by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and rheological properties were analyzed by compressive penetration tests with a texture analyzer. As expected, SFC had a major impact on rheological properties, but lipid crystalline microstructure also had significant effects. Correlation analysis showed that rheological properties were highly correlated with the various quantitative microstructural parameters, with the exception of the fractal dimension by the PCM. Empirical models adequately correlated rheological properties with SFC and microstructure density. Compression modulus increased by a factor of about ten as SFC increased from 0.28 to 0.51. However, for systems with the same SFC, compression modulus was dependent on microstructure. At low SFC compression modulus increased by about a factor of seven over the range of microstructures formed, whereas at higher SFC compression modulus only increased by a factor of about two. 3asunflower oil 3apalm oils 3atriacylglycerols 3along chain fatty acids 3aunsaturated fatty acids 3asaturated fatty acids 3acrystallization 3achemical structure1 aShi, Yuping1 aHartel, Richard W.0 tjournal of the American Oil Chemists' Society.g2008 May, v. 85, no. 5 p.397-404dSpringer-Verlagx0003-021X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11746-008-1213-23Available from publisher's Web site  a20080516b20080606c00000000  aINDdRSCe2008/05/16  aOther US 7aarticle03613naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002700164245010900191300001600300520182400316650001702140650002202157650002602179650003402205650002802239650002002267650002802287650001102315650002602326650007802352650008602430650003802516650002702554650005202581650007102633653004102704653002502745653003002770700002102800700002002821700002402841773011402865852000902979856008502988930003303073946001303106655001203119IND4439446720221117195400.0100702e201006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443944672DNAL7 a205443442pmid7 a10.1007/s00232-010-9266-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMillership, Joanne E. 10aDifferential Regulation of Calcium-Activated Potassium Channels by Dynamic Intracellular Calcium Signals  ap. 191-210.  aCalcium (Ca²⁺)-activated K⁺ (KCa) channels regulate membrane excitability and are activated by an increase in cytosolic Ca²⁺ concentration ([Ca²⁺]i), leading to membrane hyperpolarization. Most patch clamp experiments that measure KCa currents use steady-state [Ca²⁺] buffered within the patch pipette. However, when cells are stimulated physiologically, [Ca²⁺]i changes dynamically, for example during [Ca²⁺]i oscillations. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to examine the effect of dynamic changes in [Ca²⁺]i on small (SK3), intermediate (hIK1), and large conductance (BK) channels. HEK293 cells stably expressing each KCa subtype in isolation were used to simultaneously measure agonist-evoked [Ca²⁺]i signals, using indo-1 fluorescence, and current/voltage, using perforated patch clamp. Agonist-evoked [Ca²⁺]i oscillations induced a corresponding KCa current that faithfully followed the [Ca²⁺]i in 13-50% of cells, suggesting a good synchronization. However, [Ca²⁺]i and KCa current was much less synchronized in 50-76% of cells that exhibited Ca²⁺-independent current events (55% of SK3-, 50% of hIK1-, and 53% of BK-expressing cells) and current-independent [Ca²⁺]i events (18% SK3- and 33% of BK-expressing cells). Moreover, in BK-expressing cells, where [Ca²⁺]i and KCa current was least synchronized, 36% of total [Ca²⁺]i spikes occurred without activating a corresponding KCa current spike, suggesting that BKCa channels were either inhibited or had become desensitized. This desynchronization between dynamic [Ca²⁺]i and KCa current suggests that this relationship is more complex than could be predicted from steady-state [Ca²⁺]i and KCa current. These phenomena may be important for encoding stimulus-response coupling in various cell types. 3aion channels 3aelectrophysiology 2aCalciumxpharmacology 2aCalcium Signalingxphysiology 2aCarbacholxpharmacology 2aCells, Cultured 2aFura-2xdiagnostic use. 2aHumans 2aIndolesxpharmacology 2aIntermediate-Conductance Calcium-Activated Potassium Channelsxphysiology 2aLarge-Conductance Calcium-Activated Potassium Channelsxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aMembrane Potentialsxdrug effects 2aPatch-Clamp Techniques 2aPotassium Channels, Calcium-Activatedxagonists 2aSmall-Conductance Calcium-Activated Potassium Channelsxphysiology 0aCalcium activated potassium channels 0aCalcium oscillations 0aDynamic calcium signaling1 aHeard, Caroline 1 aFearon, Ian M. 1 aBruce, Jason I.

In Escherichia coli, the production of curli fibers, an important adhesion factor, responds to c-di-GMP. The yddV-dos operon, which encodes a DGC and a c-PDE acting as a protein complex, is highly expressed at a low growth temperature and in the stationary phase, i.e. conditions that also stimulate curli production. We show that perturbations in the balance between YddV and Dos, obtained either through inactivation of the yddV gene or through overproduction of either YddV or Dos, strongly affect curli production. Both YddV and Dos proteins regulate the transcription of the csgBAC operon, which encodes curli structural subunits, while not affecting the expression of the regulatory operon csgDEFG. Consistent with the role of both YddV and Dos proteins as oxygen sensors, their effects on csgBAC gene expression were dramatically reduced in cells grown under anoxic conditions. Our results show that the yddV-dos operon plays an important role in the expression of curli-encoding genes in aerobically growing E. coli, and suggest that YddV and Dos, through their opposite activities, might finely tune curli production in response to oxygen availability. 0ac-di-GMP 0adiguanylate cyclase 0aphosphodiesterase 0abiofilm formation 0aadhesion factors 0acurli 0aoxygen sensing1 aMaciąg, Anna.1 aAntoniani, Davide1 aLandini, Paolo0 tFEMS immunology and medical microbiology.g2010 Aug., v. 59, no. 3 p.477-484dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0928-82447nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1574-695X.2010.00702.x3Available from publisher's Web site  aNon-US 7aarticle02675naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002300145245009900168300001600267520134100283650002601624650001501650650002201665650001101687650002301698650002301721650000901744650001201753650002101765650001001786650001101796650001501807650001601822653003301838653002401871653002701895700001701922700002101939700001701960773010201977852000902079856008502088930003302173946001102206655001202217IND4437504820221117195941.0100522e201006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443750482DNAL7 a10.1007/s10526-009-9262-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFirlej, Annabelle 10aImpact of host behavioral defenses on parasitization efficacy of a larval and adult parasitoid  ap. 339-348.  aKoinobiont parasitoid females when attacking host species are faced with barriers at various levels, host behavioral defenses represent one of these barriers. We present data of the effects of host behavioral defenses on host preference of larval and adult parasitoid. We quantified the effects of defensive behaviors of the exotic host, Harmonia axyridis (Pallas), and the indigenous host, Coleomegilla maculata lengi Timberlake (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), on the handling time and attack preference of the indigenous parasitoid, Dinocampus coccinellae Schrank (Hymenoptera: Braconidae). Successful egg development was also recorded as a consequence of host behavioral defense and unsuitability. Female parasitoids were offered in an interspecific choice test, adult or larvae of both H. axyridis and C. maculata, and in an intraspecific choice test, larval and adult stage of H. axyridis. Adult H. axyridis exhibited a greater number of defensive behaviors compared to adult C. maculata or larval H. axyridis resulting in significantly longer handling time by the parasitoid. Our results suggest that host acceptance cues used by the generalist parasitoid D. coccinellae are inadequate to evaluate adult H. axyridis. These results provide support to the hypothesis that H. axyridis represents an evolutionary trap for D. coccinellae. 3aColeomegilla maculata 3aDinocampus 3aHarmonia axyridis 3aadults 3abiological control 3adefensive behavior 3aeggs 3afemales 3ahost preferences 3ahosts 3alarvae 3aparasitism 3aparasitoids 0aHost-parasitoid relationship 0aBehavioral defenses 0aDinocampus coccinellae1 aLucas, Eric.1 aCoderre, Daniel 1 aBoivin, Guy 0 tBioControl.g2010 June, v. 55, no. 3 p.339-348dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx1386-61417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10526-009-9262-53Available from publisher's Web site  a20100522b20100605c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02021naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245012700163300001600290520079100306650002701097650002601124650002301150650001901173650001501192650003101207650001301238650001401251650003301265650001401298650001401312653001901326700001901345700001901364773010201383852000901485856008501494930003301579946001101612655001201623IND4438838320221117195734.0100619e201008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443883832DNAL7 a10.1007/s10526-010-9289-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHultberg, M. 10aLate blight on potato is suppressed by the biosurfactant-producing strain Pseudomonas koreensis 2.74 and its biosurfactant  ap. 543-550.  aPotato late blight disease caused by the zoospore-producing pathogen Phytophthora infestans (Mont.) de Bary is one of the most destructive plant diseases world-wide and currently its management mainly relies on the frequent use of fungicides. This study investigated the possibility of reducing potato late blight by biocontrol with the biosurfactant-producing strain Pseudomonas koreensis 2.74. Significant disease reduction with the biosurfactant-producing strain and its biosurfactant was observed in greenhouse trials using a detached-leaf assay. A direct effect of the biosurfactant on zoospores of P. infestans was also observed, whereas the biosurfactant only caused a minor reduction in mycelial growth rate and had no effect on the rate of sporangia production in pure culture. 3aPhytophthora infestans 3aPseudomonas koreensis 3abiological control 3abiosurfactants 3afungicides 3agreenhouse experimentation 3amycelium 3apathogens 3aplant diseases and disorders 3asporangia 3azoospores 0aBiosurfactants1 aBengtsson, T. 1 aLiljeroth, E. 0 tBioControl.g2010 Aug., v. 55, no. 4 p.543-550dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx1386-61417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10526-010-9289-73Available from publisher's Web site  a20100619b20100703c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03846naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001600129245013200145300001600277520181400293650003002107650001702137650001002154650001102164650001002175650001902185650002502204650001302229650001702242650001702259650001402276650001902290650002102309650001602330650001902346650001602365650001202381650001502393650002002408650001902428650001202447650002202459650003702481650002102518650001902539650003402558650005602592650003502648650003102683650003302714650007002747650002802817650002802845650002002873650001702893653003102910653004602941700001502987700001503002773006503017852000903082930003303091945001303124946001103137655001203148IND2334199520221117195816.0030930e200304  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233419952DNAL7 a126873612pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarrier, P.10aCadmium distribution and microlocalization in oilseed rape (Brassica napus) after long-term growth on cadmium-contaminated soil  ap. 939-950.  aBrassica napus (L.) was grown from seeds on a reconstituted soil contaminated with 100 mg Cd kg(-1). Compared with roots and stems, leaves accumulated high amounts of Cd. Although the Cd concentration in the leaves remained high throughout plant growth and no appreciable change was noticed in the total, extractable or soluble Cd in the soil adhering to the roots, the symptoms of Cd toxicity (leaf chlorosis, growth retardation) decreased with time. Cd induced a noticeable accumulation of phytochelatins in young plants (aged 22 days), which decreased in parallel to the disappearance of the symptoms of Cd intoxication. The subcellular distribution of Cd in leaves of Cd-acclimated plants was determined using biochemical, microscopic and metal-imaging techniques. Leaf fractionation by differential centrifugations showed that Cd was present predominantly in the 'soluble' fraction corresponding to the vacuoles and the cytoplasm. Transmission electron microscopic analyses revealed that those cell compartments contained electron-dense granules associated with needle-like structures. Cd, and also high amounts of sulfur, was detected in those structures by electron-spectroscopic imaging. This technique also showed Cd binding to cell walls by a mechanism that does not involve sulfur atoms. In contrast, very little Cd was found in chloroplasts, and this is consistent with the preservation of photosynthesis in plants grown on Cd-polluted soil. The microanalytical results presented here confirm that long-term growth of B. napus on Cd-contaminated soil is accompanied by preferential storage of Cd in the vacuoles and the cell walls. This phenomenon diverted Cd ions from metabolically active compartments (cytosol, chloroplasts, mitochondria), resulting in a reduction of Cd toxicity in the leaves. 3aBrassica napus var. napus 3aplant growth 3aroots 3aleaves 3astems 3aplant extracts 3acytoplasmic granules 3avacuoles 3achloroplasts 3amitochondria 3achlorosis 3aphotosynthesis 3achelating agents 3aglutathione 3aphytochelatins 3aacclimation 3acadmium 3apollutants 3abioaccumulation 3asoil pollution 3abiomass 3amass spectrometry 3atransmission electron microscopy 3aplant morphology 3aultrastructure 2aAcclimatizationxdrug effects 2aBrassica napusxcytologyxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aCadmiumxmetabolismxtoxicity. 2aChelating Agentsxanalysis 2aPhotosynthesisxdrug effects 2aPlant Leavesxcytologyxdrug effectsxmetabolismxultrastructure. 2aPlant Rootsxmetabolism 2aPlant Stemsxmetabolism 2aSoilxanalysis. 2aTime Factors 0abrassica napus cv. drakkar 0aelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry1 aBaryla, A.1 aHavaux, M.0 tPlanta.g2003 Apr., v. 216, no. 6 p.939-950x0032-09357nnas  aDNAL  a20031103b20031113c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle03581naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147072000900165072000900174100002300183245007300206300001600279500014100295500002400436500001500460520130100475650002601776650002101802650001901823650002401842650002001866650002201886650002901908650001501937650001801952650004301970650001202013650001902025650002002044650002402064650001702088650002502105650004102130650003002171650006702201650003002268650002502298650001102323650004102334650001502375650002902390650002202419653002702441653001702468653001602485653001802501653003902519700002502558773013402583852000902717856008602726930003302812945002502845946001302870655001202883IND4403750120221117195813.0080329e200804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440375012DNAL7 a183582512pmid7 a10.1016/j.jada.2008.01.0472doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aX380 0aT3001 aFonseca, Vivian A.10aManagement of Type 2 Diabetes: Oral Agents, Insulin, and Injectables  ap.

Medical nutrition therapy (MNT) and physical activity are the cornerstones of management of type 2 diabetes. The progressive nature of type 2 diabetes requires use of one or more oral agents and eventually insulin, along with MNT and physical activity. The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes have recommended a lower hemoglobin A1c target of <6.5%, and many health care providers strive to achieve normalization of blood glucose. Achievement of these goals often prompts providers to consider combination therapy to target different pathogenic mechanisms and manage both fasting and postprandial blood glucose levels. Maintenance of glycemic control over the lifespan of a patient with diabetes is overwhelmingly likely to require combination therapy with oral diabetes medications. The UK Prospective Diabetes Study reported that <50% of patients maintained glycemic control on MNT or monotherapy with oral agents at 3 years, and that number dropped to <25% at 9 years. Newer agents and insulins have become available since the UK Prospective Diabetes Study was completed and have enhanced our armamentarium of therapeutics for treatment of diabetes. 3adiet-related diseases 3aglycemic control 3ahuman diseases 3ahypoglycemic agents 3aglycohemoglobin 3aphysical activity 3acombination drug therapy 3ahemoglobin 3ablood glucose 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3ainsulin 3adrug injection 3ahuman nutrition 3aoral administration 3adiet therapy 2aAdministration, Oral 2aBlood Glucosexanalysisxmetabolism. 2aCombined Modality Therapy 2aDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2xdrug therapyxprevention & control. 2aDrug Therapy, Combination 2aExercisexphysiology 2aHumans 2aHypoglycemic Agentsxtherapeutic use 2aInjections 2aInsulinxtherapeutic use 2aNutrition Therapy 0anoninsulin injectables 0adrug therapy 0asensitizers 0asecretagogues 0adipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitors1 aKulkarni, Karmeen D.0 tJournal of the American Dietetic Association.g2008 Apr., v. 108, no. 4 p.S29-S33dAmerican Dietetic Associationx0002-82237nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jada.2008.01.0473Available from publisher's Web site  a20100319b20100403c00000000  aINDd7CTe2008/09/18  aOther US 7aarticle03011naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245013100128300001800259500028100277500002400558520167500582650002702257650001702284650002002301650002202321650001302343650001902356650002302375700001502398700003302413773014302446852000902589856008702598655001202685IND4464938220221117195742.0130215s2012    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446493822DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThomsen, J.D.10aUsing exploratory factor analysis to explore personal attitudes influencing the people-plant relationship in Danish workplaces  ap. 1167-1172.  aPaper presented at the International Symposium on Advances in Ornamentals, Landscape and Urban Horticulture, volume 2, Organized on the Occasion of the 28th International Horticultural Congress on Science and Horticulture for People, held August 22-27, 2010, Lisbon, Portugal.  aIncludes references  aIn this paper we present the results of an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) investigating the attitudes of 37 Danish employees towards ornamental plants at their workplace. The material used was collected as part of a larger qualitative case study exploring people-plant relationships in Danish office workplaces. A paper-pencil questionnaire was developed in order to collect demographical information about the employees at the workplaces under investigation. A scale composed of 13 items regarding the attitudes towards ornamental plants at the workplace was also included in the questionnaire. All the items were formulated as statements to which the respondents had to state the extent to which they agreed. The possible answers were built around a 5-point Likert scale in the range from “not at all” to “to a very high extent”. By an EFA it was analysed how many factors the scale actually measured. The result identified two factors: one regarding whether ornamental plants were wanted in the workplace or not; and one regarding whether ornamental plants were perceived as beneficial in relation to general well-being at the workplace or not. The Cronbach alpha coefficient for the first factor was 0.79 and 0.93 for the second factor. These two factors form an interesting platform from which the question of how personal attitudes are influencing the people-plant relationship at Danish workplaces can be investigated further. However, it should be noted that the results reported here are preliminary, due to the small number of respondents and the fact that the respondents were not selected randomly. Therefore we are planning to do further studies. 3aattitudes and opinions 3acase studies 3ahuman resources 3aornamental plants 3aplanning 3aquestionnaires 3aworking conditions1 aMuller, R.1 aSonderstrup-Andersen, H.H.K.0 tActa horticulturae.g2012 Sept., , no. 937 p.1167-1172dInternational Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/937/937_146.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02893naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100002300129245008900152300001600241500001500257520119800272650002401470650001701494650001201511650001201523650001301535650002501548650002301573650002801596650001501624650002701639650002401666650004601690650003801736650003101774650002601805650004401831650003401875650003101909650002501940650002301965650004001988653003402028653003302062653002102095653001802116700001702134700001402151700001902165773006502184852000902249930003302258945001302291946001102304655001202315IND2334200220221117195636.0030930e200304  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233420022DNAL7 a126873642pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGomez-Casati, D.F.10aUltrasensitive behavior in the synthesis of storage polysaccharides in cyanobacteria  ap. 969-975.  a2019-12-05  aThe glycogen synthetic pathway operates ultrasensitively as a function of the ADPglucose pyrophosphorylase (ADPGlcPPase) allosteric effectors, 3-phosphoglycerate and Pi, in permeabilized cells of the cyanobacterium Anabaena PCC 7120. In vitro data previously showed that the ultrasensitive behavior of ADPGlcPPase depends upon cross-talk between the two allosteric effectors, the enzyme's response being additionally modulated by molecular crowding [D.F. Gomez Casatiet al. (2000) Biochem J 350:139-147]. In the present work we show, experimentally and with a mathematical model, that alpha-1,4-glucan synthesis is also ultrasensitive in cells due to the propagation of the switch-like behavior of ADPGlcPPase to the synthetic pathway. Amplifications of up to 20-fold in storage-polysaccharide synthesis can be achieved with a modest 6.7-fold increase in 3-phosphoglycerate in the presence of 5 mM Pi in contrast to the 30-fold necessary in its absence. This is the first time that this phenomenon has been reported to occur in the glycogen synthetic pathway of a photosynthetic prokaryote. The implications of the results for plant cell physiology during light-dark transitions are discussed. 3amathematical models 3abiosynthesis 3aglucose 3aglucans 3aAnabaena 3abiochemical pathways 3abacterial proteins 3anucleotidyltransferases 3aphosphates 3a3-phosphoglyceric acid 3aglucose 1-phosphate 2aAdenosine Diphosphate Glucosexmetabolism 2aAnabaenaxenzymologyxmetabolism. 2aCell Membrane Permeability 2aGlucansxbiosynthesis 2aGlucose-1-Phosphate Adenylyltransferase 2aGlucosephosphatesxmetabolism 2aGlyceric Acidsxmetabolism 2aGlycogenxmetabolism 2aModels, Biological 2aNucleotidyltransferasesxmetabolism 0aadenosine diphosphate glucose 0aadpglucose pyrophosphorylase 0aalpha-1,4-glucan 0aCyanobacteria1 aCortassa, S.1 aAon, M.A.1 aIglesias, A.A.0 tPlanta.g2003 Apr., v. 216, no. 6 p.969-975x0032-09357nnas  aDNAL  a20031103b20031113c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02193naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245008000126300001800206500028100224500002400505520073100529650001101260650002601271650001601297650001401313650001201327650002401339650001301363650001601376650001101392650000701403650001601410650001601426700001801442700001601460700001701476700002101493700001801514773014301532852000901675856008701684655001201771IND4464938020221117195700.0130215s2012    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446493802DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalas, M.C.10aVertical gardening.

The plants grow with or without substrate for root growth, i.e., in hydroponic systems or are cultivated soilless. Unlike horticultural crops such systems consist of many species with different requirements and are subject to complex environmental conditions. The physical and physico-chemical fertigation solution is characterized by EC, pH and oxygen content. Also oscillations of temperature, light and humidity need to be considered. The design of the hydroponic systems needs to become adapted to different constructions. Some hydroponic recirculating systems for use in vertical gardening are suggested. 3acities 3aenvironmental factors 3afertigation 3agardening 3agardens 3ahorticultural crops 3ahumidity 3ahydroponics 3aoxygen 3apH 3aroot growth 3atemperature1 aVerdejo, M.M.1 aSanchez, A.1 aGuzmán, M.,1 aValenzuela, J.L.1 aMontero, J.L.0 tActa horticulturae.g2012 Sept., , no. 937 p.1153-1160dInternational Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/937/937_144.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03045naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144072001700161100001600178245013500194300001600329520153900345650002301884650001201907650002201919650001801941650002101959650002101980650000802001650001602009650002102025650002602046650002702072650001502099650001602114650001702130651001802147653002402165700001802189700002102207700002002228700002102248700002202269700001502291700001902306773009802325852000902423930003302432945002502465946001302490655001202503IND4373586520221117195901.0050825e200511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437358652DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Eighteen animals were used (12 males and 6 females) in the experiment and slaughtered at 9 months of age with a live weight of 20 kg. The animals were randomly distributed in the following treatments: nine animals were in a picket with pond, nine animals in a picket without pond. The animals were maintained in a semi confinement system during 4 months and were fed grass in the trough (Carex riparia, Panicum grumosum, sugar-cane, leaves from the banana plant, elephant grass, corn, pelletized diets for rabbits "ad libitum"), mineral salt and pasture with Cynodon dactylon. Lipids contents presented differences (P<0.05) with values ranging from 1.81% to 2.26% for loin and 3.93% to 4.74% for ham, with and without pond management, respectively. The cholesterol contents were similar for loin and ham, but different (P<0.05) for with (45.7 mg/100 g) and without pond (52.1 mg/100 g) management. By maintaining the natural habits of capybaras (with pond), the cuts presented lipids with lower saturated fatty acids contents, higher monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids contents and lower cholesterol contents.

In this study an abundantly transcribed member (rbcS1) of the ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase small-subunit gene family of chrysanthemum (Chrysanthemum morifolium Ramat.) was cloned. The promoter of rbcS1 was found to be homologous to promoters of highly expressed rbcS gene members of the plant families Asteraceae, Fabaceae and Solanaceae. The regulatory 5' and 3' non-translated regions of rbcS1 were engineered to drive heterologous expression of various genes. In chrysanthemum, the homologous rbcS1 cassette resulted in a beta-glucuronidase (gusA) accumulation of, at maximum, 0.88% of total soluble protein (population mean 0.17%). In tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.), the gusA expression reached 10% of total soluble protein. The population mean of 2.7% was found to be 7- to 8-fold higher than for the commonly used cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter (population mean 0.34%). RbcS1-driven expression of sea anemone equistatin in potato (Solanum tuberosum L.), and potato cystatin in tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) yielded maximum levels of 3-7% of total soluble protein. The results demonstrate, that the compact 2-kb rbcS1 expression cassette provides a novel nuclear transformation vector that generates plants with expression levels of up to 10% of total protein. 3aSolanum tuberosum 3apotatoes 3aplant proteins 3atomatoes 3aterminator regions 3avegetable crops 3agene expression 3aNicotiana tabacum 3asequence analysis 3aChrysanthemum morifolium 3amolecular cloning 3atobacco 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 3aribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase 3atransgenes 3atransgenic plants 3areporter genes 3aCauliflower mosaic virus 3agenetic vectors 3abeta-glucuronidase 3aAnthozoa 2aBase Sequence 2aChrysanthemumxgenetics 2aCystatinsxbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aSolanum lycopersicumxgenetics. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPlants, Genetically Modified 2aPromoter Regions, Geneticxgenetics 2aProtein Biosynthesis 2aProteinsxgenetics 2aRibulose-Bisphosphate Carboxylasexgenetics 2aSequence Homology, Nucleic Acid 2aSolanum tuberosumxgenetics 2aTerminator Regions, Geneticxgenetics 2aTobaccoxgenetics 0acystatin 0arbcs1 protein 0amolecular sequence data 0aequistatin 0anucleotide sequences1 aPeters, J.1 aJong, J. de.1 aRademakers, W.1 aJongsma, M.A.0 tPlanta.g2003 Apr., v. 216, no. 6 p.1003-1012x0032-09357nnas  aDNAL  a20031103b20031113c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02864naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002300110245013400133300001800267500028100285500002400566520147300590650002002063650001202083650001102095651002202106651001202128651002902140651001702169651001002186651001802196700001502214700004602229773014302275852000902418856008702427655001202514IND4464939320221117195852.0130215s2012    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446493932DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCasares Porcel, M.14aThe Moorish Myrtle, history, and recovery of Alhambra garden lost species (Myrtus communis L. subspecies Baetica Casares et Tito)  ap. 1237-1250.  aPaper presented at the International Symposium on Advances in Ornamentals, Landscape and Urban Horticulture, volume 2, Organized on the Occasion of the 28th International Horticultural Congress on Science and Horticulture for People, held August 22-27, 2010, Lisbon, Portugal.  aIncludes references  aThe gardens of the Alhambra and the Generalife (Granada, Spain) present several hundred years old specimens of a very rare type of Myrtus. They are characterised by crowded, large leaves frequently arranged in trimerous whorls. The morphology of these myrtles proves to be peculiar and clearly sets the samples found in Granada as different from both wild specimens and other commonly cultivated forms. Compared studies reveal that this was the main type of myrtle used during the Middle Ages in the Islamic gardens of the Iberian Peninsula. Knowledge of this plant and its use has been lost in Europe since the Renaissance until the present day. However it is still grown in the U.S. and Morocco In this article we analyse the identity of these plants; describe the importance of their use in the medieval gardens of al-Andalus; investigate the cultivation and knowledge of myrtle in classical, Medieval-Islamic and modern times; localise the plant’s distribution and identify the possible routes of its dispersal from the Mediterranean to Northern Europe, America and South Africa. Knowledge of the plant’s historical importance can be used to reintroduce it in Europe and encourage cultivation in the U.S. This paper presents the results of the research project “Estudio Botánico e historiográfico de Myrtus en la Alhambra y Generalife”, supported by the Patronato de la Alhambra y Generalife and the Junta de Andalucía, which the authors are working on. 3aMyrtus communis 3agardens 3aleaves 3aIberian Peninsula 3aMorocco 3aNorthern European region 3aSouth Africa 3aSpain 3aUnited States1 aRojo, J.T.1 aReyes González-Tejero García, M. de los0 tActa horticulturae.g2012 Sept., , no. 937 p.1237-1250dInternational Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/937/937_154.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02721naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100001700161245009400178300001600272500001500288520125900303650001101562650002301573650001801596650001601614650001201630650001301642650002501655650001601680650001401696650001601710650001101726650001401737650001401751650001601765650002001781650001401801653001901815700001501834700001601849700001401865700001301879700001501892700001501907700001501922700001501937700001301952773009801965852000902063930003302072945002502105946001302130655001202143IND4373586220221117195922.0050825e200511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437358622DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Composition and total flavonol content of the plants were determined as they matured in a hydroponic-versus a soil-based system. 'Purplette' onions (Allium cepa L.) were grown hydroponically in a greenhouse for as long as 77 days. Composition of the plant tissue was determined at weekly or biweekly intervals. Ca, Mg, K, and N (wet matter basis) all decreased as plants matured. Dry matter (DM) and S contents were constant regardless of age averaging 10.6% and 187 mg/100 g, respectively. Total flavonol (TF) content increased as plants matured (226-538 mg/100 g at 14 and 77 days, respectively). Onions grown in hydroponic units or in potting medium had similar composition for all constituents examined (10.38%, 0.550%, 4.15%, and 0.97% DM, N, C, and ash, respectively; and 126.0, 55.5, 270, 185 and 453 mg/100 g Ca, Mg, K, S and TF, respectively). Based on phenotypic characteristics and composition determined in this study, onions were well suited to hydroponic propagation. 3asulfur 3adry matter content 3afood analysis 3aAllium cepa 3acalcium 3anitrogen 3adevelopmental stages 3ahydroponics 3amagnesium 3aash content 3aonions 3apotassium 3aflavanols 3apot culture 3amineral content 3aplant age 0aphytochemicals1 aMorris, J.1 aPeffley, E.1 aGreen, C.1 aPare, P.1 aTissue, D.1 aJasoni, R.1 aHutson, J.1 aWehner, B.1 aKane, C.0 tSubtropical plant science.g2005 Nov., v. 18, no. 7 p.635-645wJournal:20855x0485-20447nnas  aDNAL  a20051011b20051102c00000000  aINDdPNNe2005/09/01  aOther US 7aarticle02610naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001600145245015700161300001600318500002400334520155000358650002001908650001001928650001201938650001401950650002401964650000701988650001701995650001602012650000902028651001702037651001802054700001702072773010202089852000902191856004802200655001202248IND4393711420221117195844.0070805e200708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439371142DNAL7 a10.1007/s00226-007-0144-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMayer, Ingo10aElement content and pH value in American black cherry (Prunus serotina) with regard to colour changes during heartwood formation and hot water treatment  ap. 537-547.  aIncludes references  aElement content and pH value in wood tissues of veneer grade logs of P. serotina Ehrh. were investigated with regard to wood colour variations, measured in the CIEL*a*b* system. The average pH value of heartwood tissue was about pH 4.0 and medium colour parameters of veneer sheets were determined at L* = 73, a* = 9.8, and b* = 23.5. Optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) analyses showed differences in the element contents between two regional forest sites coming from Pennsylvania and West Virginia, USA, respectively. The latter is mainly characterised by higher variations of micro-element content in the transition zone (influencing heartwood formation) and also pH value of wood tissue, which contributes to higher variations in colour response of industrially produced veneer sheets. Investigations under industrial conditions underline the correlation between length and intensity of heat treatment in veneer production and colour development: with increasing duration and temperature of hot water treatment, veneer surfaces become darker and wood colour is intensified (ΔL = 3.6, Δa = 2.1, comparing 12 and 72 h of hot water treatment at 60°C). However, no equalisation of wood colour was achieved by modifying the treatment conditions. Artificial radiation by UV-visible light, quickly and extensively darkens and intensifies wood colour (ΔL = 16, Δa = 3.5, and Δb = 4.0 after 15 h of artificial radiation), but variations in wood colour deriving from different treatment conditions during veneer production, were not reduced. 3aPrunus serotina 3acolor 3aforests 3aheartwood 3ahot water treatment 3apH 3aspectroscopy 3atemperature 3awood 3aPennsylvania 3aWest Virginia1 aKoch, Gerald0 tWood science and technology.g2007 Aug., v. 41, no. 6 p.537-547dSpringer-Verlagx0043-77197nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00226-007-0144-7 7aarticle02841naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147072000900165072000900174100001800183245006500201300001600266500014100282500002400423500001500447520086700462650002201329650001901351650002301370650001401393650004301407650001201450650002001462650001601482650001401498650006001512650005201572650002801624650001101652650002301663650004501686650002001731650002801751653002601779653001601805653002401821653002701845653002001872700002501892700002201917773013401939852000902073856008602082930003302168945002502201946001302226655001202239IND4403750520221117195934.0080329e200804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440375052DNAL7 a183582552pmid7 a10.1016/j.jada.2008.01.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT300 0aX3801 aCummings, Sue10aObesity Surgery: Evidence for Diabetes Prevention/Management  ap.

Development of type 2 diabetes can be delayed or sometimes prevented from manifestation in individuals with obesity that are able to lose weight. Weight loss can be achieved either medically with behavioral therapies that combine diet and exercise treatment or with behavioral therapies combined with weight-loss medications or weight-loss surgery. There is strong evidence of an amelioration or resolution of type 2 diabetes in patients undergoing gastric bypass surgery. A recently published retrospective cohort study indicated that long-term total mortality from diabetes, heart disease, and cancer after gastric bypass surgery was substantially reduced. In this review, we summarize the evidence of surgical interventions in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. 3abariatric surgery 3ahuman diseases 3adisease prevention 3amorbidity 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3aobesity 3ahuman nutrition 3aweight loss 3amortality 2aBariatric Surgeryxadverse effectsxmethodsxmortality. 2aDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2xprevention & control 2aGastric Bypassxmethods 2aHumans 2aInsulin Resistance 2aObesity, Morbidxcomplicationsxsurgery. 2aRisk Assessment 2aWeight Lossxphysiology 0adiet-related diseases 0abody weight 0aweight loss surgery 0agastric bypass surgery 0adisease control1 aApovian, Caroline M.1 aKhaodhiar, Lalita0 tJournal of the American Dietetic Association.g2008 Apr., v. 108, no. 4 p.S40-S44dAmerican Dietetic Associationx0002-82237nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jada.2008.01.0173Available from publisher's Web site  a20100319b20100403c00000000  aINDd7CTe2008/09/18  aOther US 7aarticle02516naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245006500126300001400191500027100205500002400476500001500500520115700515650001601672650002801688650001701716650002601733650002201759650001501781650002501796650001701821653001901838700001701857700001901874700001701893773013801910852000902048856008502057655001202142IND4464942920221117195849.0130215s2012    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446494292DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFraga, C.G.10aPhytochemicals as antioxidants: chemistry and health effects  ap. 63-69.  aPaper presented at the International Symposium on Emerging Health Topics in Fruits and Vegetables, IHC 2010, Organized on the Occasion of the 28th International Horticultural Congress on Science and Horticulture for People, held August 22-27, 2010, Lisbon, Portugal.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aHigh consumption of fruit and vegetables is associated to a better health, and to lower incidence of cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, certain cancers, and several other age-related degenerative disorders. These health benefits could be associated to a group of phytochemicals present in edible plants and derived foods and beverages, generically termed polyphenols. The distribution of polyphenols in plants is complex and their concentrations and proportions in each plant are not just genetically determined but affected by the breed of the plant, environmental factors, and the different processing steps. The general hypothesis is that the health benefits are surrogate to the antioxidant actions of the polyphenols based on a set of chemical features shared by these compounds. However, direct antioxidant effects require tissue concentrations of polyphenols reached only in certain tissues. Thus, additional actions compatible with actual polyphenol levels are under intensive research. Nitric oxide concentration determinants are discussed as an antihypertensive mechanism with multiple steps susceptible to be modulated by certain flavonoids. 3apolyphenols 3acardiovascular diseases 3anitric oxide 3aenvironmental factors 3afruit consumption 3aflavonoids 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 0aphytochemicals1 aOteiza, P.I.1 aLitterio, M.C.1 aGalleano, M.0 tActa horticulturae.g2012 Nov., , no. 939 p.63-69dInternational Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/939/939_7.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02071naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024003600117024003900153040001800192100002000210245008800230300001400318506007600332506003100408520063900439592002801078596003501106506003701141650003001178650002601208650002601234650002001260650002101280650002901301650001301330651001501343700002201358700001601380700001501396773012601411856008201537961000901619852000901628655001201637IND60732583720221215142545.0220901e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073258372DNAL7 a10113/73258372hdl7 a10.1016/j.jeem.2016.10.0042doi7 a10.1016/j.jeem.2016.10.0042chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarnache, Cloé14aThe social costs of second-best policies: Evidence from agricultural GHG mitigation  ap. 39-73.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aThis paper investigates the social costs of second-best agricultural greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation policies. Adjustments along the land use and input intensity margins are represented within a regionalized optimization model of California crop production calibrated to economic and agronomic information. Second-best policies relying on spatially aggregated GHG emission factors lead to small abatement efficiency losses, while policies targeting a single GHG lead to moderate losses. In contrast, policies targeting a single input entail large abatement efficiency losses, which nonetheless can be reduced by combining instruments.  aPublisher supplied data  cUSDA Economic Research Service0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aagri-environmental policy 3aair pollution control 3acost benefit analysis 3acrop production 3aemissions factor 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3aland use 3aCalifornia1 aMérel, Pierre R.1 aLee, Juhwan1 aSix, Johan0 tJournal of Environmental Economics and Management.g2017 Mar., v. 82 p.39-73dElsevier BVwJournal:12464x0095-06967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jeem.2016.10.0043Available from publisher's site  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle02528naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245006500171300001600236520124400252592002801496650002501524650001901549650002701568650002101595650001101616650001101627650000901638653001301647653001001660653001001670653001901680653002101699700002101720700002001741700002201761700002601783700002101809700002101830700002201851773011501873856008501988852000902073655001202082IND60524238420221122003351.0160705e20160526xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052423842DNAL7 a10.1080/17480272.2016.11723432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAndō, Keisuke,10aDrill and laser incising of lamina for fire-resistive glulam  ap. 176-181.  aConventional glued-laminated timber (glulam) was not permitted to use to a wooden building in the fire preventive district since the amendments of the Building Standards. We already developed a one-hour fire-proof glulam made of Japanese cedar. We also succeeded to give one-hour fire performance to cross laminated timber by the same concept. The both structures are composed of three parts which are load-bearing part, fire-die-out part and surface part. The fire-die-out part is made of lamina incised by CO ₂ laser and impregnated the fire retardant evenly. As the handling of CO ₂ laser is not so easy for glulam manufacturer, we felt a growing need for drill incising technology. Therefore, we made pinholes of some diameters up to 2.5 mm to lamina of Japanese cedar, by a drill and investigated differences of hole position on two sides of the lamina. The maximum off-center for length and width directions was 1.8 and 3.3 mm, respectively. These off-centers are 2.3% and 41% of distances between neighboring hole on incising patterns. As the results of impregnating performance and fire-resistive performance of lamina incised by drill, significant differences were not recognized between drill incising and laser incising.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCryptomeria japonica 3acarbon dioxide 3across laminated timber 3aflame retardants 3aglulam 3alasers 3awood 0aIncising 0adrill 0alaser 0afire-resistant 0alaminated timber1 aHattori, Nobuaki1 aHarada, Toshiro1 aKamikawa, Daisuke1 aMiyabayashI, Masayuki1 aNishimura, Kouta1 aKakae, Norichika1 aMiyamoto, Keiichi0 tWood material science and engineering.g2016 May 26, v. 11, no. 3 p.176-181dTaylor & Francisx1748-02807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17480272.2016.11723433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02771naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245014000169300001800309520127500327592002801602650001901630650001601649650001601665650001601681650001701697650003001714650001601744650001701760650002401777650001301801650000901814650002901823653001701852653001701869653002201886653001001908653001601918700001801934700002001952700001701972700001501989700001302004700002102017700001302038773011802051856008702169852000902256655001202265IND60569812720221121054134.0170612e20160603xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056981272DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jproteome.6b000152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Zhihao10aMetabonomics Approach to Assessing the Metabolism Variation and Endoexogenous Metabolic Interaction of Ginsenosides in Cold Stress Rats  ap. 1842-1852.  aMetabolic profiling technology, a massive information provider, has promoted the understanding of the metabolism of multicomponent medicines and its interactions with endogenous metabolites, which was previously a challenge in clarification. In this study, an untargeted GC/MS-based approach was employed to investigate the urinary metabolite profile in rats with oral administration of ginsenosides and the control group. Significant changes of urinary metabolites contents were observed in the total ginsenosides group, revealing the impact of ginsenosides as indicated by the up- or down-regulation of several pathways involving neurotransmitter-related metabolites, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, fatty acids β-oxidation, and intestinal microflora metabolites. Meanwhile, a targeted UPLC-QQQ/MS-based metabonomic approach was developed to investigate the changes of urinary ginsenoside metabolites during the process of acute cold stress. Metabolic analysis indicated that upstream ginsenosides (rg1, re, and rf) increased significantly, whereas downstream ginsenosides (ck, ppd, and ppt) decreased correspondingly after cold exposure. Finally, the relationships between ginsenosides and significantly changed metabolites were investigated by correlation analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeta oxidation 3acold stress 3acorrelation 3afatty acids 3aginsenosides 3aintestinal microorganisms 3ametabolites 3ametabolomics 3aoral administration 3aproteome 3arats 3atricarboxylic acid cycle 0ametabonomics 0aginsenosides 0aacute cold stress 0aGC/MS 0aUPLC-QQQ/MS1 aWang, Xiaoyan1 aWang, Jingcheng1 aJia, Zhiying1 aLiu, Yumin1 aXie, Xie1 aWang, Chongchong1 aJia, Wei0 tJournal of Proteome Research.g2016 June 03, v. 15, no. 6 p.1842-1852dAmerican Chemical Societyx1535-39077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jproteome.6b000153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03673naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001900138245006600157300001800223500002000241500001500261520228600276592002802562650001302590650001102603650001202614650001202626650002302638650002002661650002202681650001202703650001402715650001502729650001202744650001302756650002102769650001102790650001502801650001002816650001002826651001402836653001702850700001702867700001702884700002602901700001902927700002502946773009102971856007203062852000903134655001203143IND60576358520221119125514.0170802e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057635852DNAL7 a10.1002/ecy.18892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDoody, J. Sean10aChronic effects of an invasive species on an animal community  ap. 2093-2101.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  a2019-12-06  aInvasive species can trigger trophic cascades in animal communities, but published cases involving their removal of top predators are extremely rare. An exception is the invasive cane toad (Rhinella marina) in Australia, which has caused severe population declines in monitor lizards, triggering trophic cascades that facilitated dramatic and sometimes unexpected increases in several prey of the predators, including smaller lizards, snakes, turtles, crocodiles, and birds. Persistence of isolated populations of these predators with a decades‐long sympatry with toads suggests the possibility of recovery, but alternative explanations are possible. Confirming predator recovery requires longer‐term study of populations with both baseline and immediate post‐invasion densities. Previously, we quantified short‐term impacts of invasive cane toads on animal communities over seven years at two sites in tropical Australia. Herein, we test the hypothesis that predators have begun to recover by repeating the study 12 yr after the initial toad invasion. The three predatory lizards that experienced 71–97% declines in the short‐term study showed no sign of recovery, and indeed a worse fate: two of the three species were no longer detectable in 630 km of river surveys, suggesting local extirpation. Two mesopredators that had increased markedly in the short term due to these predator losses showed diverse responses in the medium term; a small lizard species increased by ~500%, while populations of a snake species showed little change. Our results indicate a system still in ecological turmoil, having not yet reached a “new equilibrium” more than a decade after the initial invasion; predator losses due to this toxic invasive species, and thus downstream effects, were not transient. Given that cane toads have proven too prolific to eradicate or control, we suggest that recovery of impacted predators must occur unassisted by evolutionary means: dispersal into extinction sites from surviving populations with alleles for toxin resistance or toad avoidance. Evolution and subsequent dispersal may be the only solution for a number of species or communities affected by invasive species for which control is either prohibitively expensive, or not possible.  aPublisher supplied data 3asympatry 3arivers 3aalleles 3alizards 3aanimal communities 3aRhinella marina 3along term effects 3asurveys 3apredators 3aextinction 3aturtles 3atoxicity 3ainvasive species 3asnakes 3acrocodiles 3atoads 3abirds 3aAustralia 0aBufo marinus1 aRhind, David1 aGreen, Brian1 aCastellano, Christina1 aMcHenry, Colin1 aClulow, S.q(Simon),0 tEcology.g2017 Aug., v. 98, no. 8 p.2093-2101dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecy.18893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02462naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002700150245010700177300001600284520121000300592002801510650001201538650001401550650000901564650001601573650001101589650002201600650000901622650001701631650000901648650001701657653002301674653001901697653001701716653002601733700002201759700002401781700002701805773011501832856008401947852000902031655001202040IND60524238620221122003400.0160705e20160807xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052423862DNAL7 a10.1080/17480272.2014.9667552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaadatnia, Mohammadali10aInvestigation on transversal variation of poplar tension wood quality using ultrasound wave parameters  ap. 201-208.  aTransversal variations of some ultrasound wave parameters (phase velocity, group velocity, attenuation coefficient and acoustic radiation) were measured from the pith to the bark of poplar tension wood discs in different orthotropic directions. Over 80 cubic specimens of 2 × 2 × 10 cm ³ (radial, tangential and longitudinal, respectively) were prepared and tested acoustically. Samples containing tension woods were separated from normal ones using anatomical experiments. Results showed acoustical behaviour of normal and tension wood improved in longitudinal direction while the distance between pith and bark increased; also, wave parameter variations were less important in radial and tangential directions. In addition, phase velocity and acoustic radiation – which significantly varied – were the best parameters for quality assessment of poplar wood compared with group velocity and attenuation coefficients. Since samples near the bark were acoustically better than counterparts near the pith, they could be used in products requiring more strength, like lumber. Finally, acoustic radiation and phase velocity were correlated more strongly with density than group velocity and attenuation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPopulus 3aacoustics 3abark 3aengineering 3alumber 3amaterials science 3apith 3atension wood 3awood 3awood quality 0aAcoustic radiation 0aphase velocity 0atension wood 0atransversal variation1 aEnayati, Aliakbar1 aPourtahmasi, Kambiz1 aMoradian, Mohammadhadi0 tWood material science and engineering.g2016 Aug. 7, v. 11, no. 4 p.201-208dTaylor & Francisx1748-02807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17480272.2014.9667553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02335naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245007500171300001400246520109500260592002801355650002101383650001901404650001701423650001801440650002001458650001301478650001601491650001701507650001501524650001501539650003501554650002701589650001501616650002901631650001901660650001201679700001801691773011301709856008201822852000901904655001201913IND60634431220221120160833.0211129e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063443122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pbi.2019.03.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMäkinen, Kristiina14aThe significance of methionine cycle enzymes in plant virus infections  ap. 67-75.  aBoth biotic and abiotic stresses cause changes in the activities of plant methionine cycle (MTC) enzymes. These changes contribute to the ability of the plant to manage stress. On the other hand, viruses utilize MTC enzymes to promote infection. Here, we review the growing but still limited knowledge of the interactions between plant viral proteins and MTC enzymes. Virus-induced changes in S-adenosyl methionine synthetase and S-adenosyl homocysteine hydrolase activities debilitate transcriptional and post-transcriptional RNA silencing and affect antiviral defense reactions connected to ethylene and polyamine biosynthesis pathways. Viral perturbations of host methionine homeostasis couple trans-sulfuration and gluthathione biosynthesis pathways to MTC functions. Large multiprotein complexes, which contain viral proteins and MTC enzymes, may represent metabolons assembled for specific viral functions or host defense responses. Proper understanding of the MTC-associated metabolic and regulatory interactions will reveal those with potential to create virus resistance in plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA interference 3aabiotic stress 3abiosynthesis 3abiotic stress 3aenzyme activity 3aethylene 3ahomeostasis 3ahomocysteine 3ahydrolases 3amethionine 3amethionine adenosyltransferase 3amultiprotein complexes 3apolyamines 3atranscription (genetics) 3aviral proteins 3aviruses1 aDe, Swarnalok0 tCurrent opinion in plant biology.g2019 Aug., v. 50 p.67-75dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl58157x1369-52667nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pbi.2019.03.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02924naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100001500189245010300204506007600307520124200383592002801625506003701653650001801690650002201708650002701730650001201757650000901769650001801778650001201796650002201808650001201830650002101842650002201863650001201885650001601897650002801913650002201941650001201963653001301975653001201988653001302000653001302013653002002026653001402046700001902060700002502079700005902104773011502163856008302278852000902361655001202370IND60661660720221207082215.0190830e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066166072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ibmb.2019.1032242doi7 aPMC67520492pmcid7 a314460312pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Pingxi10aDEET and other repellents are inhibitors of mosquito odorant receptors for oviposition attractants  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn addition to its primary function as an insect repellent, DEET has many “off-label” properties, including a deterrent effect on the attraction of gravid female mosquitoes. DEET negatively affects oviposition sites. While deorphanizing odorant receptors (ORs) using the Xenopus oocyte recording system, we have previously observed that DEET generated outward (inhibitory) currents on ORs sensitive to oviposition attractants. Here, we systematically investigated these inhibitory currents. We recorded dose-dependent outward currents elicited by DEET and other repellents on ORs from Culex quinquefasciatus, Aedes aegypti, and Anopheles gambiae. Similar responses were observed with other plant-derived and plant-inspired compounds, including methyl jasmonate and methyl dihydrojasmolate. Inward (regular) currents elicited by skatole upon activation of CquiOR21 were modulated when this oviposition attractant was coapplied with a repellent. Compounds that generate outward currents in ORs sensitive to oviposition attractants elicited inward currents in a DEET-sensitive receptor, CquiOR136. The best ligand for this receptor, methyl dihydrojasmolate, showed repellency activity but was not as strong as DEET in our test protocol.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAedes aegypti 3aAnopheles gambiae 3aCulex quinquefasciatus 3aXenopus 3adeet 3adose response 3afemales 3ainsect repellents 3aligands 3amethyl jasmonate 3aodorant receptors 3aoocytes 3aoviposition 3aoviposition attractants 3aoviposition sites 3askatole 0aCquiOR21 0aCquiOR2 0aCquiOR37 0aCquiOR99 0aOutward current 0aInhibitor1 aZeng, Fangfang1 aBedoukian, Robert H.1 aLeal, Walter S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6800-12400 tInsect biochemistry and molecular biology.g2019 Oct., v. 113dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48131x0965-17487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ibmb.2019.1032243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03137naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245010800171300001600279520142000295592002801715650001601743650002601759650002601785650001601811650002501827650001601852650001501868650001801883650004301901650001301944650002601957650001101983650002201994650002302016650002302039650001602062650002102078650002702099650001102126650002102137650002102158650000902179653001402188653002302202653002202225653002102247700002702268700002002295700001802315700001802333773011502351856008402466852000902550655001202559IND60524238720221122003520.0160705e20160807xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052423872DNAL7 a10.1080/17480272.2014.9705742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMattos, Bruno D.10aChemical characterization of wood and extractives of fast-growing Schizolobium parahyba and Pinus taeda  ap. 209-216.  aThis study aims to evaluate the chemical composition of wood and extractives of Pinus taeda and Schizolobium parahyba (guapuruvu) as potential feedstock for new applications in the biorefinery industry. For this purpose, their content of α -cellulose, hemicellulose, insoluble lignin, hot water solubility, NaOH ₁% solubility, inorganic materials (ash), and monomeric sugars by high-performance liquid chromatography was quantified. Attenuated total reflectance infrared spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analysis were also used to complete the physicochemical characterization of the studied woods. The extractives were obtained by soxhlet extraction with ethanol:toluene and dichloromethane and identified with pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy technique. The results showed that guapuruvu wood has the higher amount of hemicellulose (16%) when compared to pine wood (10%), which resulted in higher solubility in alkali solution. Furthermore, in relation to other biomasses, the two woods presented more percentage of lignin and minor content of hemicelluloses. The P. taeda wood presented the highest percentage of extractives mainly composed of fatty acids and aromatic hydrocarbons, while guapuruvu wood had a higher percentage of phenolic compounds and also fatty acids. Both the materials have low content of extractives with dichloromethane and were mainly composed of lipophilic compounds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus taeda 3aSchizolobium parahyba 3aaromatic hydrocarbons 3abiorefining 3achemical composition 3afatty acids 3afeedstocks 3ahemicellulose 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aindustry 3ainfrared spectroscopy 3alignin 3amass spectrometry 3amethylene chloride 3aphenolic compounds 3areflectance 3asodium hydroxide 3asolid phase extraction 3asugars 3athermogravimetry 3awater solubility 3awood 0aPyr-GC/MS 0athermal evaluation 0abiomass feedstock 0amonomeric sugars1 aLourençon, Tainise V.1 aGatto, Darci A.1 aSerrano, Luis1 aLabidi, Jalel0 tWood material science and engineering.g2016 Aug. 7, v. 11, no. 4 p.209-216dTaylor & Francisx1748-02807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17480272.2014.9705743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02757naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003000148245015100178520119500329592002801524650002701552650002001579650001601599650002401615650001701639650001801656650002101674650002001695650001301715650002501728650002901753653001201782653002701794653001801821653001801839653002201857653002301879700003101902700002101933700006501954700006102019773012702080856008302207852000902290655001202299IND60741547120221118103925.0210812e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074154712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pmpp.2021.1016802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArévalo-Marín, Diego F.10aJasmonic acid priming of potato uses hypersensitive response-dependent defense and delays necrotrophic phase change against Phytophthora infestans  aOne of the most important diseases affecting potato is late blight, caused by the oomycete Phtytophthora infestans. The use of jasmonic acid has been reported to reduce the progression of the disease in potato, but the defense mechanisms involved in this response are unknown. In this study we described the effect of jasmonic acid as a priming agent over time in the defense response of potato against the invasion of P. infestans. We observed that the initial stimulus generated by the exogenous application of jasmonic acid had an effect on the stomatal conductance of the treated tissue and activated StMYC2 expression. Results reveal a priming effect in plants inoculated 11 days after treatment with jasmonic acid, evidenced by an increased transcriptional induction of defense-associated genes, decrease in the number of necrotic lesions and an evident reduction of lesion area (72.23%). Furthermore, in this study, we show that the tested concentration of jasmonic acid does not have an adverse effect at the physiological level in plants, since variation in stomatal conductance was transient, no change in chlorophyll a fluorescence and no early senescence in leaves was observed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhytophthora infestans 3aadverse effects 3achlorophyll 3adisease progression 3afluorescence 3ajasmonic acid 3aphase transition 3aplant pathology 3apotatoes 3astomatal conductance 3atranscription (genetics) 0aPriming 0aPhytohpthora infestans 0aJasmonic acid 0aBiotic stress 0aSolanum tuberosum 0aInduced resistance1 aBriceño-Robles, Daniel M.1 aMosquera, Teresa1 aMelgarejo, Luz Marina1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3148-19111 aSarmiento, Felipe1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4836-45460 tPhysiological and molecular plant pathology.g2021 Aug., v. 115 p.101680-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl39032x0885-57657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pmpp.2021.1016803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02549naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245010300173300001600276520117400292592002801466650001001494650001501504650001601519650001601535650002201551650001201573650001101585650001701596650002301613650001601636650000901652653001801661653002901679653002501708653002201733653003401755653002601789700002101815700002501836700002201861773011501883856008401998852000902082655001202091IND60524238920221116210453.0160705e20160807xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052423892DNAL7 a10.1080/17480272.2014.9734432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZelinka, Samuel L.10aMoisture storage and transport properties of preservative treated and untreated southern pine wood  ap. 228-238.  aMoisture storage and transport properties of southern pine (Pinus spp.) wood were measured for implementation into hygrothermal models. Specimens were untreated or pressure-treated with alkaline copper quaternary (ACQ) preservative. Moisture storage was characterized with sorption isotherms in the hygroscopic region (high capillary pressures) and documented with mercury intrusion porosimetry in the overhygroscopic region (low capillary pressures). The data were then combined into a single moisture retention curve as a function of capillary pressure. Moisture transport was evaluated from steady-state water vapor transmission and dynamic capillary water absorption experiments. These data were used to calculate the moisture permeability over the entire range of capillary pressures using the diffusivity approach of Carmeliet et al . Moisture storage and transport properties were similar for the untreated and ACQ-treated southern pine, except for the permeability of the treated wood which was lower in the radial direction. The data presented here can be used to improve the accuracy of hygrothermal and combined hygrothermal–corrosion modeling simulations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus 3aabsorption 3adiffusivity 3aengineering 3amaterials science 3amercury 3amodels 3apermeability 3asorption isotherms 3awater vapor 3awood 0aSouthern pine 0awater vapor transmission 0acapillary absorption 0asorption isotherm 0amercury intrusion porosimetry 0ahygrothermal modeling1 aGlass, Samuel V.1 aBoardman, Charles R.1 aDerome, Dominique0 tWood material science and engineering.g2016 Aug. 7, v. 11, no. 4 p.228-238dTaylor & Francisx1748-02807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17480272.2014.9734433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01697naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002600145245007400171300001800245520048300263592002800746650001200774650001400786650001400800650001800814650002200832650001300854650001800867700005400885700001900939700002600958700006800984700006201052773013301114856007901247852000901326655001201335IND60723601420220413000000.0210115e20210104xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072360142DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.0c024102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRivas-Loaiza, Juan A.10aSynthesis of Solanum Alkaloid Demissidine Stereoisomers and Analogues  ap. 1575-1582.  aDemissidine is an indolizidine alkaloid isolated from several potato species.

Though many rhomboid‐like proteins are predicted in plants, their detailed molecular mechanisms or cellular functions are not yet known. Of the 13 predicted rhomboids in Arabidopsis thaliana, one, RBL10, affects lipid metabolism in the chloroplast, because in the respective rbl10 mutant the transfer of phosphatidic acid through the inner envelope membrane is disrupted. Here we show that RBL10 is part of a high‐molecular‐weight complex of 250 kDa or greater in size. Nine likely components of this complex are identified by two independent methods and include Acyl Carrier Protein 4 (ACP4) and Carboxyltransferase Interactor1 (CTI1), which have known roles in chloroplast lipid metabolism. The acp4 mutant has decreased C16:3 fatty acid content of monogalactosyldiacylglycerol, similar to the rbl10 mutant, prompting us to offer a mechanistic model of how an interaction between ACP4 and RBL10 might affect chloroplast lipid assembly. We also demonstrate the presence of a seventh transmembrane domain in RBL10, refining the currently accepted topology of this protein. Taken together, the identity of possible RBL10 complex components as well as insights into RBL10 topology and distribution in the membrane provide a stepping‐stone towards a deeper understanding of RBL10 function in Arabidopsis lipid metabolism.  aPublisher supplied data  aDE‐FG02‐91ER20021cUS Department of Energy  aT32‐GM110523cNIH 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aacyl carrier protein 3achloroplasts 3afatty acid composition 3alipid metabolism 3amechanistic models 3amutants 3aphosphatidic acids 3aproteinases 3atopology1 aSmith, Montgomery1 aXu, Yang1 aFroehlich, John E.1 aDe La Mora, Cameron1 aBenning, Christoph1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8585-36670 tplant journal.g2021 Dec., v. 108, no. 5 p.1332-1345dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl47643x0960-74127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/tpj.155143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02495naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245009100168300001600259520123700275592002801512650001701540650002301557650001101580650002401591650003101615650001301646650001201659650001701671650001701688650001301705650000901718650001501727651001401742653001101756653001501767653001601782653001301798700002201811700002101833773010301854856008301957852000902040655001202049IND60621141520221117221054.0181116e200707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062114152DNAL7 a10.1260/0958305077810761852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmenumey, Felix10aEnergy Production and Consumption Patterns and Planning: A Case of Northeast Minnesota  ap. 373-392.  aThe Clean Energy Resource Teams (CERTs) is a project designed to give local citizens and other stakeholders a voice in planning and determining their energy future. In total, there are seven CERTs operating in seven regions across Minnesota, USA. CERTs connect citizens with technical expertise to facilitate planning and implementation of energy conservation and renewable energy projects. These technical resources are helping the teams identify and prioritize the most appropriate and cost-effective opportunities within their regions. This paper will describe one of these energy teams (the Northeast CERT) and its efforts in promoting clean energy production and conservation. A key product of the Northeast CERT is a strategic energy plan that highlights the region's top energy priorities. As part of its project priorities, the Northeast Minnesota CERT is working to set up demonstration projects at every school and community in the region. Toward this goal, the team is currently collaborating with two schools in the region to set up renewable energy projects such as wind and solar, which in turn would help students to understand that renewables and conservation can and should be an integral part of our energy system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclean energy 3acost effectiveness 3aenergy 3aenergy conservation 3aenergy use and consumption 3aplanning 3aschools 3asolar energy 3astakeholders 3astudents 3awind 3awind power 3aMinnesota 0aEnergy 0aProduction 0aConsumption 0aPlanning1 aPawlisch, Melissa1 aUkaga, Okechukwu0 tEnergy & environment.g, v. 18, no. 3 p.373-392dSAGE PublicationswJournal:26865x2048-40707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1260/0958305077810761853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02423naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002000142245009100162500001900253520144700272592002801719650001401747650002101761650001201782650001501794700002101809700002601830700002401856700002501880773011901905856007602024852000902100655001202109IND60718871620221116214645.0201126e20201108xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071887162DNAL7 a10.3390/foods91116322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNucci, Daniele 10aAre the Italian Children Exposed to Advertisements of Nutritionally Appropriate Foods?  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aUnhealthy eating habits are one of the main risk factors for overweight/obesity, and food marketing plays a major role in their development. The aim of this study was to monitor the amount and the characteristics of food marketing directed to Italian children broadcasted on television (TV). The WHO tool to assess food and beverage multimedia marketing aimed at children was used to analyze TV recordings. Type of product branded, viewing time, channel’s target, and broadcasting company were the exposure variables analyzed. The power of persuasive techniques was also assessed. Food products were categorized as either core or non-core products on the basis of their nutritional profile. A total of 320 h of TV broadcasting was analyzed, including 51.7 h of commercials. Food and beverages were the second most frequently advertised products, with an average of 6 food advertisements per hour during peak viewing time. A total of 23.8% of food advertisements were recorded during the time slot of 3:00 p.m. Considering food and beverage commercials, “humor” was the most frequently used primary persuasive technique, while the “image of the product/packaging” was the most commonly used secondary persuasive technique. Products specifically targeted to children were 94.3% non-core. Our findings indicate that core foods are highly underrepresented in TV commercials, especially during children TV programs and peak viewing time.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeverages 3anutrient content 3aobesity 3atelevision1 aRabica, Filippo 1 aDallagiacoma, Giulia 1 aFatigoni, Cristina 1 aGianfredi, Vincenza 0 tFoods.g2020 Nov. 08, v. 9, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods91116323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02753naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001600146245018600162300002000348520142600368592002801794650002501822650001701847650002001864650002001884650001301904650001501917650001601932650001101948650001701959700002201976700001401998700002602012700001402038700001602052700001502068700001702083700001702100773012302117856008202240852000902322655001202331IND60562261520170926000000.0170204e20161006xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056226152DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcb.6b045032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVentura, A.10aHydrogen Emission and Macromolecular Radiation-Induced Defects in Polyethylene Irradiated under an Inert Atmosphere: The Role of Energy Transfers toward trans-Vinylene Unsaturations  ap. 10367-10380.  aThis article is aimed at studying the evolution of H₂ release as well as radiation-induced defects in polyethylene (PE), as a function of the irradiation dose under anoxic conditions. We analyze the influence of the energy transfers and trapping toward radiation-induced defects on the evolution of the radiation chemical yields with dose. One key objective herein is to quantify the contribution of these transfers toward trans-vinylene (TV) on H₂ emission. For this purpose, pure PE was irradiated in a large dose domain and H₂ emission was compared to that in predoped PEs containing chemically inserted TV groups irradiated at low doses. In parallel, evolutions of the concentrations of the TV groups and minor defects (vinyl and trans–trans-diene) as a function of dose were considered. Moreover, measuring simultaneously H₂ and unsaturated groups had allowed inferring the cross-linking evolution with dose. With this methodology, we have succeeded in quantifying the efficiency of TVs and cross-links as energy traps and, using simple models, in fully describing the evolution of all of the radiation chemical yields. Besides, irradiations were performed using either low linear energy transfer irradiations (electron beams, γ rays) or ion beams, with the objective to assess the influence of the high ionization and excitation densities induced by the latter on PE ageing and energy transfer processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanaerobic conditions 3acrosslinking 3aenergy transfer 3agamma radiation 3ahydrogen 3aionization 3airradiation 3amodels 3apolyethylene1 aNgono-Ravache, Y.1 aMarie, H.1 aLevavasseur-Marie, D.1 aLegay, R.1 aDauvois, V.1 aChenal, T.1 aVisseaux, M.1 aBalanzat, E.0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2016 Oct. 06, v. 120, no. 39 p.10367-10380dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcb.6b045033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03385naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245012000165300001300285500001500298520211300313592002802426650001002454650001402464650001302478650001502491650001502506650001902521650002402540650002202564650001302586650002202599650002502621650001702646653001502663700001702678700001802695700002002713700002002733773010802753856008102861852000902942655001202951IND50073176720221119090536.0150213e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007317672DNAL7 a10.1007/s11270-013-1807-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChoi, Jae-Woo10aSeparation of Sulfur Hexafluoride from a Nitrogen/Sulfur Hexafluoride Mixture Using a Polymer Hollow Fiber Membrane  ap. 1807.  a2019-12-06  aSulfur hexafluoride (SF₆) has been evaluated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) as the substance with the highest global warming index. Because of its superior insulating and arc clearing capacities, it is commonly used as an insulator in electrical machines. SF₆waste products form in the process of storing, maintaining, and repairing the machines. SF₆emitted into the atmosphere remains for 3,200 years, causing global warming. Release into the mesosphere leads to photolysis and creation of highly toxic and corrosive by-products. A review of the literature related to the retrieval and separation of SF₆using a separating membrane indicates that research on the permeability of the separating membrane material is lacking. Additionally, research on the concentrations of the SF₆waste products and the separation/retrieval with operating conditions with optimal energy efficiency is only in the initial stages. Therefore, this research assessed the permeability of commercialized separation membranes polysulfone (PSf), polycarbonate (PC), and polyimide (PI) using the gases SF₆and N₂. Using an SF₆/N₂mixture with the same concentration as the SF₆waste products, we studied the separation and retrieval capacities of PSf, PC, and PI separation membranes under varying operating conditions. The permeability tests showed that the selective permeability of N₂/SF₆is highest for the PI membrane and lowest for the PC membrane. When the concentrations of SF₆retrieved from the mixture separation process were compared, the PC membrane was found to be the highest, with 95.6 % at 0.5 MPa. The retrieval percentage of SF₆was highest for PSf, with 97.8 % at an operating pressure of 0.3 MPa and a waste production of 150 cm³/min. The retrieval rates and retrieval failure rates have an inverse relationship. In total, 99 % of the supply of SF₆was identified via the retrieval rates and retrieval failure rates, so it could be confirmed that the separation of the SF₆/N₂mixture using a macromolecular hollow fiber separation membrane works properly.  aPublisher supplied data 3agases 3aequipment 3anitrogen 3aphotolysis 3abyproducts 3aglobal warming 3asulfur hexafluoride 3aenergy efficiency 3atoxicity 3acommercialization 3ainsulating materials 3apermeability 0aatmosphere1 aLee, Soonjae1 aAn, Byungryul1 aKim, Sŏng-bae,1 aYi, Sang-hyŏp,0 tWater, air, and soil pollution.g2014 Feb., v. 225, no. 2 p.1807-1807dSpringer-Verlagx0049-69797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-013-1807-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02743naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002200137245010500159300001600264520158000280592002801860650001701888650001001905650001501915650001301930650001001943650001901953650002701972650001101999650001302010650002002023650001202043650000902055650001402064650001502078651002002093700002002113700002002133773008802153856007102241852000902312655001202321IND50063016920221122234625.0130324s2012    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006301692DNAL7 a10.1071/WR112142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBower, Deborah S.10aEcological and physiological impacts of salinisation on freshwater turtles of the lower Murray River  ap. 705-710.  aContext The increasing intensity and extent of anthropogenically mediated salinisation in freshwater systems has the potential to affect freshwater species through physiological and ecological processes. Determining responses to salinisation is critical to predicting impacts on fauna. Aims We aimed to quantify the response of wild-caught turtles from freshwater lakes that had become saline in the lower Murray River catchment. Methods Plasma electrolytes of all three species of freshwater turtle from South Australia were compared among two freshwater sites (Horseshoe Lagoon and Swan Reach), a brackish lake (Lake Bonney) and a saline lake (Lake Alexandrina). Key results Chelodina longicollis, C. expansa and Emydura macquarii from a brackish lake had higher concentrations of plasma sodium and chloride than those from freshwater habitats. However, osmolytes known to increase under severe osmotic stress (urea and uric acid) were not elevated in brackish sites. Turtles from the highly saline lake were colonised by an invasive marine worm which encased the carapace and inhibited limb movement. Conclusions Freshwater turtles in brackish backwaters had little response to salinity, whereas the C. longicollis in a saline lake had a significant physiological response caused by salt and further impacts from colonisation of marine worms. Implications Short periods of high salinity are unlikely to adversely affect freshwater turtles. However, secondary ecological processes, such as immobilisation from a marine worm may cause unexpected impacts on freshwater fauna.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectrolytes 3afauna 3afreshwater 3ahabitats 3alakes 3aosmotic stress 3aphysiological response 3arivers 3asalinity 3asodium chloride 3aturtles 3aurea 3auric acid 3awatersheds 3aSouth Australia1 aDeath, Clare E.1 aGeorges, Arthur0 tWildlife research.g2012, v. 39, no. 8 p.705-710dCSIRO Publishingx1035-37127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/WR112143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03153naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245009700172300001800269520195100287592002802238650002502266650000902291650002002300650001102320650001602331651001602347653002002363653002302383653002702406653001402433653001402447653001402461653002402475653001102499700002102510773012902531856008602660852000902746655001202755IND60721053220221120121304.0210506e20201201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072105322DNAL7 a10.1080/19440049.2020.17985122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrandsch, Rainer10aRepeated use food contact materials: A categorisation approach in support of risk assessment  ap. 2184-2203.  aThe current migration assessment requirements regarding safety of plastic food contact materials in Europe (e.g. kitchen utensils, kitchen appliances, packaging, etc.) widely rely on migration testing. According to Annexe V of Regulation (EU) No 10/2011 migration testing requirements consider the specificities of repeated use applications only to a limited extent. Repeated use food contact materials should be tested for three consecutive times at the worst-case contact time and temperature. If diffusion controlled, the migration decreases with increasing number of repeated uses. Compared to single use applications, repeated use food contact materials typically exhibit much shorter contact times, much lower ratios of surface in contact with a given amount of food, and in some cases higher temperatures. Compared to real use, in many cases highly overestimated migration testing result are observed. Overestimation by testing at the beginning of use may be coupled with underestimation at later times. National legislation of the Netherlands on food contact materials has established a classification for repeated use rubber materials based on the R-value indicating whether migration testing is required or not. The R-value considers in more detail specificities of repeated use applications. This publication investigates to which extent it is possible to apply the approach to plastics food contact materials in Europe. It is practically impossible to perform migration tests for various materials by putting them many times in contact with food over a long period of time, typically several years, at several temperatures and areas to food amount ratios migration. Modelling has therefore been used to predict migration from various food contact materials under different repeated use scenarios. Realistic diffusion properties of materials and migrant partitioning behaviour have been assumed to minimise the risk of underestimation.  aPublisher supplied data 3alaws and regulations 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3arubber 3atemperature 3aNetherlands 0aRisk assessment 0aexposure modelling 0afood contact materials 0amigration 0adiffusion 0apackaging 0amigration modelling 0arubber1 aSchuster, Dieter0 tFood additives & contaminants.g2020 Dec. 01, v. 37, no. 12 p.2184-2203dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl35737x1944-00577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/19440049.2020.17985123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03086naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001500149245015000164520164000314592002801954650002401982650002102006650001602027650001202043650000902055650002002064650002302084650002102107650002302128650001002151650001202161650001702173650001502190650002002205651001002225651001802235653002602253653002202279700001602301700001902317700001202336700002002348700001602368700001502384773010002399856008402499852000902583655001202592IND60744035220221119173737.0211218e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074403522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aqrep.2021.1007802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Yeyu10aCharacterization of two lipid metabolism-associated genes and their expression profiles under different feeding conditions in Acipenser dabryanus  aAcipenser dabryanus is an endemic species restricted to the upper reaches of the Yangtze River and is listed as a national first-class protected animal in China. In the present study, two lipid metabolism-associated genes, namely, lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and apolipoprotein E (apoE), were identified from the full-length transcriptome analysis of A. dabryanus. The full-length genes encoded polypeptides with typical conserved motifs and functional sites shared with their homologues in other fish. Gene expression profile analysis showed that the LPL and apoE genes were constitutively expressed in A. dabryanus. The highest expression level of LPL was found in the muscle, while apoE was predominantly expressed in the liver. In the fasting and refeeding experiment, one hundred twenty fish were randomly assigned to four groups (fasting 0, 3, 7 or 14 d and then refed for 14 d). Fasting and refeeding significantly regulated the expression level of LPL with various expression patterns in different tissues, whereas starvation showed little effect on apoE expression. In addition, the expression levels of LPL and apoE were significantly affected by feeding frequency. The fish were bred for eight weeks at six different feeding frequencies groups (once a day, two times a day, three times a day, four times a day, five times a day and six times a day). Both LPL and apoE expression levels were significantly upregulated in the liver in the highest feeding frequency group. Our study suggests potential roles for LPL and apoE in lipid metabolism in A. dabryanus and will be useful for further study of nutrition regulation in fish.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcipenser dabryanus 3aapolipoprotein E 3aaquaculture 3afasting 3afish 3agene expression 3aindigenous species 3alipid metabolism 3alipoprotein lipase 3aliver 3amuscles 3apolypeptides 3astarvation 3atranscriptomics 3aChina 3aYangtze River 0aFasting and refeeding 0aFeeding frequency1 aWu, Xiaoyun1 aLai, Jiansheng1 aLiu, Ya1 aSong, Mingjiang1 aLi, Feiyang1 aGong, Quan0 tAquaculture reports.g2021 Nov., v. 21 p.100780-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23215x2352-51347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aqrep.2021.1007803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02384naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100002100191245011100212300001600323506007600339520086500415592002801280506003701308650002001345650002701365650001701392650001901409650001101428650001301439650001101452650001301463650000701476650001801483650002001501650000901521653002001530653002701550653002201577653001601599653002001615700002101635700002101656773011901677856008501796852000901881655001201890IND60554572820221207064751.0180905e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055457282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbapap.2016.03.0082doi7 aPMC48294512pmcid7 a269767512pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Qiongying10aRecombinant broad-range phospholipase C from Listeria monocytogenes exhibits optimal activity at acidic pH  ap. 697-705.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe broad-range phospholipase C (PLC) from Listeria monocytogenes has been expressed using an intein expression system and characterized. This zinc metalloenzyme, similar to the homologous enzyme from Bacillus cereus, targets a wide range of lipid substrates. With monomeric substrates, the length of the hydrophobic acyl chain has significant impact on enzyme efficiency by affecting substrate affinity (Km). Based on a homology model of the enzyme to the B. cereus protein, several active site residue mutations were generated. While this PLC shares many of the mechanistic characteristics of the B. cereus PLC, a major difference is that the L. monocytogenes enzyme displays an acidic pH optimum regardless of substrate status (monomer, micelle, or vesicle).

Whether this downsizing is accompanied by increased or decreased evolutionary rates of the remaining genes is poorly known, not least because homeolog pairings are often obscured by chromosomal rearrangement. Here, we use the newly published genome from a sedge, namely Kobresia littledalei, and CRISPR/Cas‐9 editing to investigate how the Rho WGD event 70 million years ago (MYA) affected transcription factor evolutionary rates, fates, and function in rice (Oryza sativa) and sorghum (Sorghum bicolor). We focus on the 30‐member DNA‐binding with one zinc finger (Dof) transcription factor family in both crops due to their agronomic importance. Using the known speciation dates of rice from Kobresia (97 MYA) and sorghum (50 MYA), we find that rates of amino acid substitution in the critical Dof domain region were over twofold higher during the 20‐million‐year period following the WGD than before or afterward. Through comparison of synteny blocks, we report that at least 11% of Dof genes were purged from 70 to 50 MYA, while only 6% have been lost in the most recent 50‐million‐year interval. CRISPR/Cas9 editing revealed widespread fitness‐related defects in flowering and lack of redundancy of paired members, as well as significant differences in expression between gene pairs. Together these findings demonstrate the strength of Dof genes as a model for deep evolutionary study and offer one of the most detailed portraits yet of the Rho WGD impact on a gene lineage.  aPublisher supplied data  a31870205cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31970517cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31870204cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  cJiangsu Collaborative Innovation Center for Modern Crop Production 3aCRISPR-Cas systems 3aKobresia 3aOryza sativa 3aSorghum bicolor 3aamino acid substitution 3achromosome aberrations 3agenes 3agenomics 3amodels 3arice 3atranscription factors 3azinc finger motif1 aMa, Shiying1 aZhang, Xiaohui1 aTian, Dacheng1 aYang, Sihai1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7862-64121 aJia, Xianqing1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2033-20481 aTraw, Milton Brian1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3148-21080 tplant journal.g2021 Dec., v. 108, no. 5 p.1365-1381dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl47643x0960-74127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/tpj.155163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03033naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245013200176300001600308500001900324520128400343592002801627650001501655650001601670650001901686650001401705650001601719650000901735650001001744650002501754650001801779650001101797650001501808650001701823650001401840650001101854650001701865650001101882650001301893650000901906650001701915650002101932653001201953653002201965653001401987653002402001653002302025653002702048653002602075700002902101700002502130700002902155700002902184773012402213856008502337852000902422655001202431IND60689715920221118031548.0200423e20160303xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068971592DNAL7 a10.3109/19390211.2015.10086092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEzike, Adaobi Chioma10aExtracts of Leptadenia hastata Leaf, a Famine Food and Traditional Remedy for Furuncles, Suppress Inflammation in Murine Models  ap. 119-135.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe effects of the methanol extract (LHE), hexane (LHHF), ethylacetate (LHEF) and methanol (LHMF) fractions of leaf of Leptadenia hastata on acute and chronic inflammation were studied. Furthermore, the effects of LHE on acetic acid induced increase in vascular permeability, carrageenan induced leucocyte migration and membrane stability were evaluated. The LHE and fractions were also subjected to phytochemical analysis. The LHE, LHEF and LHMF significantly (p < 0.05) suppressed topical ear edema, systemic paw edema, global edematous response to formaldehyde arthritis and granuloma tissue growth. The LHE suppressed acetic acid induced vascular permeability and carrageenan-induced leucocyte migration, and also stabilized the erythrocyte membrane. An acute toxicity test in mice established an oral LD₅₀ > 5 g/kg for LHE. The LHEF elicited the greatest inhibition, suggesting that the observed anti-inflammatory effects may be attributable to the flavonoids abundant in the fraction. These findings demonstrate that the effectiveness of L. hastata leaf in the treatment of furuncles may largely derive from anti-inflammatory activities mediated through inhibition of both increase in vascular permeability and leucocyte migration, and stabilization of cell membranes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLeptadenia 3aacetic acid 3aacute toxicity 3aarthritis 3acarrageenan 3aears 3aedema 3aerythrocyte membrane 3aethyl acetate 3afamine 3aflavonoids 3aformaldehyde 3agranuloma 3ahexane 3ainflammation 3aleaves 3amethanol 3amice 3apermeability 3atoxicity testing 0aabscess 0aanti-inflammatory 0afuruncles 0aleucocyte migration 0aLeptadenia hastata 0amembrane stabilization 0avascular permeability1 aUfere, Ifechukwu Kenneth1 aAkah, Peter Achunike1 aEzea, Samson Chukwuemeka1 aOkoli, Charles Ogbonnaya0 tJournal of dietary supplements.g2016 Mar. 3, v. 13, no. 2 p.119-135dInforma HealthcarewJournal:2249x1939-022X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3109/19390211.2015.10086093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03122naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245011900167520138000286592002801666650002501694650002601719650002901745650001601774650000901790650002001799650001601819650002001835650001201855650001001867650001601877650001401893650001201907650001401919650001401933650001701947650002301964653001201987653001201999653001802011653001802029653001702047700005402064700001502118700001402133700001802147700001902165700001602184700001502200700005302215700001602268700005502284773010002339856008402439852000902523655001202532IND60744035520221119173356.0211218e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074403552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aqrep.2021.1007832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDong, Zijiong10aIdentification and characterization of scavenger receptor class B member 2 in Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus)  aThe class B scavenger receptors (scarb) are members of important pattern recognition receptors which play key roles for host immune response to pathogen infection. In the present study, two scarb member 2 paralogous (Onscarb2a and Onscarb2c) were identified and characterized in Nile tilapia. Onscarb2a was identified with an open reading frame (ORF) of 1593 bp which encoded a polypeptide of 530 amino acids, and Onscarb2c was consisting of an ORF of 1446 bp which encoded a polypeptide of 461 amino acids. Both Onscarb2a and Onscarb2c share high sequence identity/similarity with their counterparts from other teleost species. Multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic tree analyses show that scarb2c from teleost fish is more closely related to other vertebrate scarb2s. Gene expression studies revealed that both scarb2a and scarb2c were highly expressed in liver, with the lowest expression in muscle in healthy tilapia. After challenges with Streptococcus agalactiae and Aeromonas hydrophila, both Onscarb2a and Onscarb2c were markedly up-regulated in liver and head kidney. In addition, the up-regulation of Onscarb2a and Onscarb2c were also detected in head kidney monocytes/macrophages and hepatocytes. In conclusion, this study revealed that Onscarb2a and Onscarb2c might play important roles in the innate immune responses to bacterial invasion in Nile tilapia.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAeromonas hydrophila 3aOreochromis niloticus 3aStreptococcus agalactiae 3aaquaculture 3afish 3agene expression 3ahepatocytes 3aimmune response 3akidneys 3aliver 3amacrophages 3amonocytes 3amuscles 3apathogens 3aphylogeny 3apolypeptides 3asequence alignment 0ascarb2a 0ascarb2c 0aS. agalactiae 0aA. hydrophila 0aHost defense1 aLi, Bingxi1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9378-78231 aWu, Liting1 aLei, Yang1 aChen, Jianlin1 aMu, Liangliang1 aWu, Hairong1 aChen, Meng1 aWang, Bei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5877-69231 aYe, Jianmin1 aLiang, Fang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9055-24390 tAquaculture reports.g2021 Nov., v. 21 p.100783-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23215x2352-51347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aqrep.2021.1007833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02410naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245007200168300001800240520142300258592002801681650001501709650002101724650002201745650001101767650001301778650001701791651000901808700006101817773012701878856008202005852000902087655001202096IND60678068120221120061241.0191213e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067806812DNAL7 a10.1007/s11269-019-02402-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJamshidi, Javad10aHedging Rules-Based Optimal Reservoir Operation Using Bat Algorithm  ap. 4525-4538.  aIn this study, optimal operation of a reservoir by incorporation of the hedging policy and the Bat Algorithm (BA) is investigated. The deficit in water supply by the dam is minimized as the objective function and the optimal monthly releases from the reservoir are determined and compared in three hedging-based operation rules. In the first rule, which has a single decision variable, a constant monthly release is considered for all 240 months of the operation period. In the second scenario, one fixed release is determined for each month of the year and is repeated in successive operating years which results 12 decision variables for the problem. In the third rule, all monthly releases are varied as the decision variables resulting 240 unknowns for the problem. The developed models are utilized for the Zhaveh reservoir in west of Iran. Results show that while BA is a suitable easy going algorithm to be applied for optimal reservoir operation planning, the amount of water deficit is lower when a higher degree of freedom is defined for the operating rules as the values for the objective function are 105.3, 102.8, and 80.5 for the first to the third scenarios, respectively. Afterward, the results using the hedging rules are compared with the standard operating policy (SOP) and it is found that the reservoir performance is more desirable in satisfying water demands when the hedging policy is applied.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3adams (hydrology) 3aissues and policy 3amodels 3aplanning 3awater supply 3aIran1 aShourian, Mojtaba1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4099-97580 tWater resources management.g2019 Oct., v. 33, no. 13 p.4525-4538dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl44305x0920-47417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11269-019-02402-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02659naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002100142245004400163500001900207520159600226592002801822650001301850650002601863650001401889650001801903650001901921650002001940650001001960650000901970650001701979700001901996700002402015700002902039773011902068856007602187961001302263852000902276655001202285IND60718872020221116214548.0201126e20201110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071887202DNAL7 a10.3390/foods91116352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBhunia, Arun K.,10aAdvances in Foodborne Pathogen Analysis  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAs the world population has grown, new demands on the production of foods have been met by increased efficiencies in production, from planting and harvesting to processing, packaging and distribution to retail locations. These efficiencies enable rapid intranational and global dissemination of foods, providing longer “face time” for products on retail shelves and allowing consumers to make healthy dietary choices year-round. However, our food production capabilities have outpaced the capacity of traditional detection methods to ensure our foods are safe. Traditional methods for culture-based detection and characterization of microorganisms are time-, labor- and, in some instances, space- and infrastructure-intensive, and are therefore not compatible with current (or future) production and processing realities. New and versatile detection methods requiring fewer overall resources (time, labor, space, equipment, cost, etc.) are needed to transform the throughput and safety dimensions of the food industry. Access to new, user-friendly, and point-of-care testing technologies may help expand the use and ease of testing, allowing stakeholders to leverage the data obtained to reduce their operating risk and health risks to the public. The papers in this Special Issue on “Advances in Foodborne Pathogen Analysis” address critical issues in rapid pathogen analysis, including preanalytical sample preparation, portable and field-capable test methods, the prevalence of antibiotic resistance in zoonotic pathogens and non-bacterial pathogens, such as viruses and protozoa.  aPublisher supplied data 3aProtozoa 3aantibiotic resistance 3aequipment 3afood industry 3afood pathogens 3afood production 3alabor 3arisk 3astakeholders1 aBisha, Bledar 1 aGehring, Andrew  G.1 aBrehm-Stecher, Byron  F.0 tFoods.g2020 Nov. 10, v. 9, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods91116353Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle03128naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245011300163300001600276500002000292520173600312592002802048650002002076650002202096650001202118650001802130650003702148650001602185650002602201650001202227650001702239650002102256651001302277700001902290700006302309700006002372700001402432700006402446773011202510856007502622852000902697655001202706IND60780661320221116154003.0220621e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078066132DNAL7 a10.1002/csc2.206522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPoudel, Pratishtha10aEcophysiological modeling of yield and yield components in winter wheat using hierarchical Bayesian analysis  ap. 358-373.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aYield components are widely recognized as drivers of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) yield across environments and genotypes. In this study, we used a hierarchical Bayesian approach to model wheat grain yield in Oklahoma on an eco‐physiological basis using yield component traits thousand kernel weight (TKW) and nonyield biomass (NYB). The Bayesian approach allowed us to quantify uncertainties around the parameter values rather than obtaining a single value estimate for a parameter. The main objectives of this study were to (a) explain wheat yield as a function of component traits TKW and NYB, and thereby examine the implications for source‐sink balance; and (b) assess their association with weather conditions during key stages of wheat development. A secondary objective was to introduce Bayesian estimation for eco‐physiological modeling. Fifteen wheat genotypes planted in three locations in Oklahoma (Altus, Chickasha, and Lahoma) were evaluated across three harvest years (2017 to 2019), whereby the combination of location and year defined an environment. Results indicate that the environment explained a greater proportion of the variability in yield than genotypes or than genotype × environment (G × E) interaction; however, evidence for G × E was substantial. Yield was expected to increase with increasing TKW and NYB, which would suggest a source limitation to achieve potential yield. Yet, the contribution of early reproductive stage weather variables to the relationship between yield and NYB pointed in the direction of sink strength being compromised. In summary, our approach provides evidence for source‐sink co‐limitation in grain yield of this sample of hard red winter wheat genotypes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aTriticum aestivum 3abiomass 3aecophysiology 3agenotype-environment interaction 3agrain yield 3ahard red winter wheat 3aweather 3awinter wheat 3ayield components 3aOklahoma1 aBello, Nora M.1 aMarburger, David A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1342-41471 aCarver, Brett F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6800-57541 aLiang, Ye1 aAlderman, Phillip D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1467-23370 tCrop science.g2022 Jan., v. 62, no. 1 p.358-373dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44570x0011-183X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/csc2.206523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03075naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002300166245014300189300001600332520131300348592002801661650000801689650002001697650001301717650002001730650002201750650001301772650001101785650002701796650001101823650004701834650001101881650001901892650002501911650001901936650003001955650001301985650004601998650003702044650002902081650004702110650002702157650003102184650003002215700001402245700002102259700002002280700001402300700002402314773011402338856004802452852000902500655001202509IND50072775720221117200445.0140208e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007277572DNAL7 a240781862pmid7 a10.1007/s12010-013-0517-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRathore, Mangal S.10aEvaluation of Genetic Homogeneity in Tissue Culture Regenerates of Jatropha curcas L. using Flow Cytometer and DNA-based Molecular Markers  ap. 298-310.  aThe present investigation aimed to evaluate the reliability of in vitro propagation methods for elite genotypes of Jatropha curcas L., that maintain genetic integrity of tissue culture (TC) regenerates among two regeneration systems developed through direct shoot bud regeneration using nodal/apical shoot segments (protocol-A) and in vitro-derived leaves (protocol-B) as explants. Random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD), intersimple sequence repeat (ISSR), simple sequence repeat (SSR) molecular markers, and flow cytometery (FCM) were employed to evaluate genetic homogeneity in TC-regenerates at different passages of subcultures. RAPD markers showed genetic homogeneity in fifth-generation TC-regenerates of both protocols. ISSR markers showed genetic stability of leaf regenerates (protocol-B) at 10th generation. FCM analysis of TC-regenerates at 10th generation in protocol-B and at 20th generation in both protocols, showed stability of ploidy level. SSR assessment of TC-regenerates at 20th generation in both protocols confirmed genetic homogeneity. The results confirmed the genetic stability of the TC-regenerates and demonstrated the reliability of the regeneration systems developed so far using explants of two different origins, for large-scale multiplication of elite genotypes of Jatropha.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aJatropha curcas 3aexplants 3agenetic markers 3agenetic stability 3agenotype 3aleaves 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aploidy 3arandom amplified polymorphic DNA technique 3ashoots 3atissue culture 2aDNA, Plantxgenetics 2aFlow Cytometry 2aGenetic Markersxgenetics 2aGenotype 2aJatrophaxcytologyxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aMicrosatellite Repeatsxgenetics 2aPlant Shootsxphysiology 2aRandom Amplified Polymorphic DNA Technique 2aRegenerationxgenetics 2aReproducibility of Results 2aTissue Culture Techniques1 aYadav, P.1 aMastan, Shaik G.1 aPrakash, Ch.

Currently, the designer’s experience is needed so different layout alternatives be analyzed to reduce the depths of the network. Generally, this operation is manual and does not ensure the best result. For this research, a depth-first search algorithm was presented, which allows the optimization of the layout of a gravity pipe network, assessing the topographic conditions of the manholes (nodes), leading to a layout that has the sum of lower unfavorable slopes. A hypothetical and a real network were used. The computational time required was considered negligible. The results showed a robust model, which works for the complete layout of any network, of any size, resulting in the lowest possible depths.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3agravity 3amodels 3atopography1 aCosta, Luis Henrique Magalhães1 aFarias, Guilherme Marques1 ade Castro, Marco Aurélio Holanda0 tWater resources management.g2019 Oct., v. 33, no. 13 p.4583-4598dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl44305x0920-47417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11269-019-02373-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02923naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245012400164300001600288520182600304592002802130650002102158650001502179650001702194650002802211653001902239653002302258653001502281653001302296653001502309700001702324773015302341856008202494852000902576655001202585IND60744035720221119173517.0220207e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074403572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.spc.2021.06.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAsgari, Amir10aHow circular economy transforms business models in a transition towards circular ecosystem: the barriers and incentives  ap. 566-579.  aThe transition towards a circular economy (CE) is increasingly seen as a solution to address sustainable development. The environmental impacts, resource restrictions, and economic and social benefits are among the reasons that justify the formation of CE businesses. Meanwhile, shifting from traditional to circular businesses requires the transformation of business model components and in-depth changes in all ecosystem entities. Thus, more insight is needed to foster the implementation of circular ecosystems. Surprisingly, however, existing literature suffers from a dearth of research in this domain. To address this gap, we used an iterative approach of systematic literature review to identify the associated values and specifications as well as thematic analysis to clarify the prerequisites of such a transition and finally, an in-depth interview to investigate the possible transformation of the business model components. The findings revealed the barriers and incentives during the transition towards a circular ecosystem, along with a conceptual framework to develop a CE ecosystem. The findings also illustrated how the circular economy transforms business model components. Altogether, this research contributes to our current understanding of the antecedents, their potential interactions, and the necessary interventions to stimulate the implementation of a circular ecosystem, including supply chain and surrounding community sub-ecosystems. Furthermore, the ecosystem approach used in this study considers the maturity level of all sub-ecosystem constituents as an indispensable requirement to develop a circular ecosystem. Finally, theoretical and practical implications are provided at a cross-national level about the implementation requirements and the shaping mechanisms of a circular ecosystem.  aPublisher supplied data 3acircular economy 3aecosystems 3asupply chain 3asustainable development 0abusiness model 0acircular ecosystem 0atransition 0abarriers 0aincentives1 aAsgari, Reza0 tSustainable Production and Consumption.g2021 Oct., v. 28 p.566-579dElsevier LtdaInstitution of Chemical EngineerswJournal:23261x2352-55097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.spc.2021.06.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01904naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245011100160300001600271520093800287592002801225650001201253650002601265650003601291650002701327700002201354700002301376773013101399856007501530852000901605655001201614IND60760964020221118011714.0211224e20211223xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076096402DNAL7 a10.1039/d1cc05590a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKarak, Pirudhan10aCationic π-extended heteroaromatics via a catalytic C–H activation annulative alkyne-insertion sequence  ap. 133-154.  aCationic π-conjugated organic molecules have broad applications in materials science as next-generation organic materials. The annulative alkyne-insertion π-extension (AAIPEX) strategy has emerged as a promising synthetic approach for the rapid synthesis of cationic polycyclic heteroaromatic compounds (cPHACs) in a single step. The AAIPEX reaction provides a synthetic shortcut to achieve complex organic molecules from simple (hetero)arene templates and alkynes as π-extending partners, which would otherwise be difficult to achieve using traditional methods. In general, a step-economic AAIPEX protocol proceeds via C–H activation of unfunctionalized heteroarene templates, followed by alkyne insertion–annulation to furnish cPHACs. In this Feature Article, recent progress in the AAIPEX strategy to construct cPHACs is described along with brief illustrations of the resulting cPHACs in luminescence-related applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkynes 3aaromatic hydrocarbons 3acarbon-hydrogen bond activation 3aheterocyclic compounds1 aRana, Samim Sohel1 aChoudhury, Joyanta0 tChemical communications.g2021 Dec. 23, v. 58, no. 2 p.133-154dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1cc05590a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03833naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001300139245009800152300001800250500002000268520187300288592002802161596005402189596005302243596008302296596006002379650001602439650001702455650002202472650001302494650002202507650002402529650001402553650001402567650002202581650003202603650001402635650002502649650001402674650003002688650001302718700001602731700001602747700001502763700001602778700001202794700001802806700001502824700001502839700001502854700001402869700001702883700001202900700001902912700001402931700005102945773011602996856007403112852000903186655001203195IND60758590120221121070207.0211130e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075859012DNAL7 a10.1111/tpj.155222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Hao10aStructural variation of mitochondrial genomes sheds light on evolutionary history of soybeans  ap. 1456-1472.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe architecture and genetic diversity of mitogenome (mtDNA) are largely unknown in cultivated soybean (Glycine max), which is domesticated from the wild progenitor, Glycine soja, 5000 years ago. Here, we de novo assembled the mitogenome of the cultivar ‘Williams 82’ (Wm82_mtDNA) with Illumina PE300 deep sequencing data, and verified it with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Southern blot analyses. Wm82_mtDNA maps as two autonomous circular chromosomes (370 871‐bp Chr‐m1 and 62 661‐bp Chr‐m2). Its structure is extensively divergent from that of the mono‐chromosomal mitogenome reported in the landrace ‘Aiganhuang’ (AGH_mtDNA). Synteny analysis showed that the structural variations (SVs) between two genomes are mainly attributed to ectopic and illegitimate recombination. Moreover, Wm82_mtDNA and AGH_mtDNA each possess six and four specific regions, which are absent in their counterparts and likely result from differential sequence‐loss events. Mitogenome SV was further studied in 39 wild and 182 cultivated soybean accessions distributed world‐widely with PCR/Southern analyses or a comparable in silico analysis. The results classified both wild and cultivated soybeans into five cytoplasmic groups, named as GSa–GSe and G1–G5; ‘Williams 82’ and ‘Aiganhuang’ belong to G1 and G5, respectively. Notably, except for members in GSe and G5, all accessions carry a bi‐chromosomal mitogenome with a common Chr‐m2. Phylogenetic analyses based on mtDNA structures and chloroplast gene sequences both inferred that G1–G3, representing >90% of cultigens, likely inherited cytoplasm from the ancestor of domestic soybean, while G4 and G5 likely inherited cytoplasm from wild soybeans carrying GSa‐ and GSe‐like cytoplasm through interspecific hybridization, offering new insights into soybean cultivation history.  aPublisher supplied data  a2016YFD0101500cNational Key R&D Program of China  a2016YFD010150cNational Key R&D Program of China  a13JS108cShaanxi Province Education Department key Laboratory Research Project  a2014KTCL02‐03cShaanxi Science and Technology Project 3aGlycine max 3aGlycine soja 3aSouthern blotting 3aancestry 3achloroplast genes 3acomputer simulation 3acultivars 3acytoplasm 3agenetic variation 3ainterspecific hybridization 3alandraces 3amitochondrial genome 3aphylogeny 3apolymerase chain reaction 3asoybeans1 aYu, Junping1 aYu, Xiaoxia1 aZhang, Dan1 aZhang, Han,1 aLi, Wei1 aSong, Haifeng1 aCui, Zheng1 aWang, Peng1 aLuo, Yixin1 aWang, Fei1 aWang, Dagang1 aLi, Zhi1 aHuang, Zhiping1 aFu, Aigen1 aXu, Min1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7206-00590 tplant journal.g2021 Dec., v. 108, no. 5 p.1456-1472dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl47643x0960-74127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/tpj.155223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03172naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245007000162300001600232500002000248520171000268592002801978596004402006596003902050596007402089596007402163650001202237650001602249650001602265650002702281650001602308650002102324650001602345650001702361650000902378700005902387700002002446700002002466700002102486700002302507773011202530856007502642852000902717655001202726IND60780661620221116154010.0220621e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078066162DNAL7 a10.1002/csc2.206722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrown, McKenna M.10aEvaluating the impact of Rht hypomorphic mutations in durum wheat  ap. 247-258.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIncreasing the yield of wheat (Triticum spp.) requires identifying new allelic combinations by crossing or by creating useful variation in yield limiting genes.

Rht‐B1b increases productive tillers but can result in plants too short for easy harvest in the northern United States and shorter coleoptiles that reduce dry soil germination. In this study, durum plants varying for Rht alleles created by ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) mutagenesis were studied to determine the impact of each allele upon agronomic and seed traits. The projects’ goal is to increase durum wheat yield through the development of a plant with height intermediate between current full‐height and semidwarf varieties. Experiments included field trials, coleoptile length and gibberellic acid (GA) responsiveness assays, and an in vitro test to determine the impact of each Rht mutation upon binding to Gibberellin Insensitive Dwarf1 (GID1). It was found that the Rht‐B1b‐E529K allele conferred plant height and coleoptile length intermediate between Rht‐B1b and Rht‐B1a containing plants, while two Rht‐A1 alleles had lesser impacts with trends toward intermediate‐height plants. The results of this research demonstrate that hypomorphic Rht alleles that alter Rht binding to GID1 may prove useful in optimizing durum wheat height to increase yield across different growing conditions.  aPublisher supplied data  cMontana Agricultural Experiment Station  cMontana Wheat and Barley Committee  a2017‐67014‐26190cUSDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture  a2019‐67014‐29199cUSDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture 3aalleles 3acoleoptiles 3adurum wheat 3aethyl methanesulfonate 3agermination 3agibberellic acid 3amutagenesis 3aplant height 3asoil1 aMartin, John M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8558-64821 aJobson, Emma M.1 aHogg, Andrew C.1 aCarr, Patrick M.1 aGiroux, Michael J.0 tCrop science.g2022 Jan., v. 62, no. 1 p.247-258dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44570x0011-183X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/csc2.206723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02837naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245013200164300001600296520152700312592002801839650002301867650001601890650001701906650002501923650001101948650001301959650001901972650002201991650001102013651001002024653002302034653002002057653001102077653000902088653001302097700001902110700001402129700001602143773015302159856008202312852000902394655001202403IND60744035920221119173343.0220207e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074403592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.spc.2021.06.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Jingjing10aImpact of the latent topics of policy documents on the promotion of new energy vehicles: Empirical evidence from Chinese cities  ap. 637-647.  aAs an important strategic emerging industry to promote sustainable economic development, new energy vehicles (NEVs) play multiple vital roles in energy saving and emission reduction and promote the transformation and upgrading of the automobile industry. China's government has formulated abundant policies to support the NEV industry. Existing studies do not pay enough attention to the latent information from NEV policy documents. This paper explores the latent topics of numerous NEV policy documents and their impact on promoting NEVs at the city level by combining the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic model and the econometric method. The results show that the latent topics of NEV policy documents can be categorized into charging infrastructure operation, promotion subsidy, and production support. The prevalence of the promotion subsidy topic is the strongest among the three types of topics. Total topic prevalences significantly promote NEV sales. The 2013 year is a turning point in policy preferences, and this change boosts NEV sales. The prevalence of promotion subsidy topic has an inverted U-shaped effect on NEV sales. The NEV sales will increase by 19% when the prevalence of production support topic increases by 1. Under the COVID-19, although the promotion subsidy policy is still dominant, the production support policy has been paid more attention. Finally, combining the development of China's NEV industry under the COVID-19 epidemic, the paper puts forward pertinent policy suggestions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aautomobiles 3aeconometrics 3aeconomic development 3aenergy 3aindustry 3ainfrastructure 3aissues and policy 3amodels 3aChina 0aNew energy vehicle 0aLDA topic model 0aPolicy 0aCity 0aCOVID-191 aJiao, Jianling1 aXu, Yuwen1 aChen, Chuxi0 tSustainable Production and Consumption.g2021 Oct., v. 28 p.637-647dElsevier LtdaInstitution of Chemical EngineerswJournal:23261x2352-55097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.spc.2021.06.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02224naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002200146245008200168300002000250520114100270592002801411650001401439650001501453650001601468650002301484650001301507650001701520650001301537650001701550700001801567700001601585700002401601700002301625773012301648856008201771852000901853655001201862IND60562262420221119050151.0170204e20161006xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056226242DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcb.6b068072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOgieglo, Wojciech10aHow Much Do Ultrathin Polymers with Intrinsic Microporosity Swell in Liquids?  ap. 10403-10410.  aAs synthetic membrane materials, polymers with intrinsic microporosity (PIMs) have demonstrated unprecedented permeation and molecular-separation properties. Here, we report the swelling characteristics of submicron-thick supported films of spirobisindane-based PIMs, PIM-1 and PIM-6FDA-OH, for six organic solvents and water using in situ spectroscopic ellipsometry. Surprisingly, PIMs swell significantly in most organic solvents, with swelling factors (SF = hₛwₒₗₗₑₙ/hdᵣy) as high as 2.5. This leads to the loss of the ultrarigid character of the polymer and produces equilibrated liquid-like swollen films. Filling of the excess frozen-in fractional free volume with liquid was discovered next to swelling-induced polymer matrix dilation. Water hardly swells the polymer matrix, but it penetrates into the intrinsic microporous structure. This study is the first to provide fundamental swelling data for PIMs, leading to better comprehension of their permeation properties. Such an understanding is indispensable for applications such as solvent filtration, natural-gas separation, and ion retention in flow batteries.  aPublisher supplied data 3abatteries 3afiltration 3anatural gas 3aphysical chemistry 3apolymers 3aporous media 3asolvents 3aspectroscopy1 aGhanem, Bader1 aMa, Xiaohua1 aPinnau, I.q(Ingo),1 aWessling, Matthias0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2016 Oct. 06, v. 120, no. 39 p.10403-10410dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcb.6b068073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03037naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245007200168300001600240500001900256520154200275592002801817650001401845650002501859650002501884650001701909650001401926650001201940650001001952650001001962650001201972650001701984650002702001650001202028650001002040650000902050650001202059650001002071650002302081650001502104650000902119650002502128650001302153650001302166650001502179650001602194650000802210653001502218653003302233773012302266856008502389852000902474655001202483IND60689716420221118031854.0200423e20160503xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068971642DNAL7 a10.3109/19390211.2015.10086142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPatel, Seema10aEmerging Adjuvant Therapy for Cancer: Propolis and its Constituents  ap. 245-268.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPropolis is a bee-metabolized resinous substance (bee glue) from plant sap and gums. It has been in usage as a healing agent since antiquity, yet has not garnered global popularity as a health promoter. Its biological effects, which range from antimicrobial, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic, dermatoprotective, anti-allergic, laxative and immunomodulatory to anticancer, have been validated. Propolis has shown efficacy against brain, head and neck, skin, breast, liver, pancreas, kidney, bladder, prostate, colon and blood cancers. The inhibition of matrix metalloproteinases, anti-angiogenesis, prevention of metastasis, cell-cycle arrest, induction of apoptosis and moderation of the chemotherapy-induced deleterious side effects have been deduced as the key mechanisms of cancer manipulation. The components conferring antitumor potentials have been identified as caffeic acid phenethyl ester, chrysin, artepillin C, nemorosone, galangin, cardanol, etc. These compounds target various genetic and biochemical pathways of cancer progression. Depending on the botanical sources and the geographical origin, biological activities of propolis vary. Despite phenomenal development in cancer research, conventional therapy falls short in complete malignancy management. The findings obtained so far build hope that propolis as a complementary medicine may address the lacunae. This review documents the recent advances and scope of amendement in cancer remediation with adequate emphasis on the mechanistic aspect of propolis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadjuvants 3aalternative medicine 3aanti-allergic agents 3aantioxidants 3aapoptosis 3abladder 3ablood 3abrain 3abreasts 3acaffeic acid 3acell cycle checkpoints 3achrysin 3acolon 3ahead 3akidneys 3aliver 3ametalloproteinases 3ametastasis 3aneck 3aneoplasm progression 3apancreas 3apropolis 3aprovenance 3aremediation 3asap 0aanticancer 0acaffeic acid phenethyl ester0 tJournal of dietary supplements.g2016 May 3, v. 13, no. 3 p.245-268dInforma HealthcarewJournal:2249x1939-022X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3109/19390211.2015.10086143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03409naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245016400173300001600337520176200353592002802115650001602143650002102159650002702180650002202207650002202229650002702251650002102278653000902299653000802308653001002316653000902326653001402335653000802349653000902357653000802366653000702374653000802381653001202389653000802401653000802409653004102417653001702458653002302475653003002498653002502528653002002553700002002573700001902593700001802612773011902630856008502749852000902834655001202843IND60554573720221116141320.0180905e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055457372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbapap.2016.03.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChatterjee, Rakesh10aTransition of phosphopantetheine adenylyltransferase from catalytic to allosteric state is characterized by ternary complex formation in Pseudomonas aeruginosa  ap. 773-786.  aPhosphopantetheine adenylyltransferase (PPAT) is a rate limiting enzyme which catalyzes the conversion of ATP and pantetheine to dephosphocoenzyme and pyrophosphate. The enzyme is allosteric in nature and regulated by Coenzyme A (CoA) through feedback inhibition. So far, several structures have been solved to decipher the catalytic mechanism of this enzyme.To address catalytic and inhibitory mechanisms of PPAT, structural insights from single crystal X-ray diffraction method were primarily used, followed by biophysical and biochemical analysis.We have solved the structures of PPAT from Pseudomonas aeruginosa with its substrate analogue AMP-PNP and inhibitor CoA. For the first time, a co-crystal structure of PPAT with Acetyl‐CoA (AcCoA) was determined. Enzymatic analysis was performed to decipher the catalytic, allosteric and inhibitory mechanisms involved in regulation of PPAT. Binding affinities of PPAT with its substrates and inhibitors were determined by SPR.Previous studies from Escherichia coli and Arabidopsis indicated the inhibitory activity of AcCoA. PPAT‐AcCoA structure along with some biochemical methods established AcCoA as an inhibitor to PPAT and illustrated its inhibitory mechanism. Transition from catalytic to allosteric state involves formation of ternary complex. We have studied the structural features of the ternary complex of PPAT along with its product pyrophosphate and inhibitor CoA and validated it with other biophysical and biochemical methods. Extensive analysis of all these 3D structures indicates that changes in side chains R90 and D94 are responsible for transition between catalytic and allosteric inhibitory states.These enzymatic studies provide new insights into the allosteric mechanism of PPAT.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3aEscherichia coli 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aX-ray diffraction 3aacetyl coenzyme A 3aadenosine triphosphate 3abinding capacity 0aPPAT 0aCoA 0aAcCoA 0aIPTG 0aSulfo-EGS 0aPPi 0aDMSO 0aPEG 0aCD 0aATP 0aAMP-PNP 0aNTA 0aPhP 0aProtein crystal and X-ray structures 0aFluorescence 0aEnzymatic analysis 0aSurface Plasmon Resonance 0aPantothenate pathway 0aTernary complex1 aMondal, Abhisek1 aBasu, Abhishek1 aDatta, Saumen0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2016 July, v. 1864, no. 7 p.773-786dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12097x1570-96397nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbapap.2016.03.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02736naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245010600162300001600268520141000284592002801694650002201722650001601744650002201760650002301782650001401805650002801819650001901847650003001866650001101896653004301907653003201950653002601982653002502008700001702033700001602050700001602066773015302082856008202235852000902317655001202326IND60744036120221119173352.0220207e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074403612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.spc.2021.06.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYi, Yongxi10aJoint tax-subsidy for a manufacturing-recycling system under further extended producer responsibility  ap. 610-623.  aThe dual constraints of resource scarcity and environmental pollution have affected sustainable socio-economic development. However, the widely used Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) system has paid little attention to resource conservation. Therefore, this paper proposes a different extended producer responsibility system (FEPR) to fill this gap. It includes two types of games, i.e., a Stackelberg game that a government games with manufacturers and a recycler, and a Cournot game between manufacturers in a product market. Through game analysis and data example analysis, draw the following critical management insights: an optimal joint tax-subsidy policy can maximize social welfare and incentive eco-innovations; market competition between manufacturers can simultaneously improve market efficiency and ecological efficiency in a well-run FEPR system; resource use tax should raise in both vertical and horizontal technology overflow, environmental cost, recycling difficulty, and the number of manufacturers while the optimal subsidy rate is only positively affected by the environmental cost of waste. The research results show that our FEPR system can save resources, reduce waste pollution, and improve social welfare simultaneously. According to different implementation backgrounds, the government should adjust the joint tax subsidy mechanism for the system to achieve optimal results.  aPublisher supplied data 3acommodity markets 3agame theory 3aissues and policy 3amarket competition 3apollution 3aproducer responsibility 3asocial welfare 3asocioeconomic development 3awastes 0aFurther extend producer responsibility 0aJoint tax-subsidy mechanism 0aEcological innovation 0aTechnology spillover1 aLiu, Shiyang1 aFu, Chunyan1 aLi, Yuqiong0 tSustainable Production and Consumption.g2021 Oct., v. 28 p.610-623dElsevier LtdaInstitution of Chemical EngineerswJournal:23261x2352-55097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.spc.2021.06.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02778naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245015200169300001600321500001900337520156500356592002801921650002501949650001001974650001901984650001502003650001402018650001602032650001302048650002202061653001802083653001402101653001502115700002402130700002102154773012302175856008502298852000902383655001202392IND60689716520221118031945.0200423e20160503xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068971652DNAL7 a10.3109/19390211.2015.10086152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWax, Benjamin10aEffects of Supplemental Citrulline-Malate Ingestion on Blood Lactate, Cardiovascular Dynamics, and Resistance Exercise Performance in Trained Males  ap. 269-282.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aCitrulline-malate (CM) has been proposed to provide an ergogenic effect during resistance exercise; however, there is a paucity of research investigating these claims. Therefore, we investigated the impact that CM supplementation would have on repeated bouts of resistance exercise. Fourteen resistance-trained males participated in a randomized, counterbalanced, double-blind study. Subjects were randomly assigned to placebo (PL) or CM (8 g) and performed three sets each of chin-ups, reverse chin-ups, and push-ups to failure. One week later, subjects ingested the other supplement and performed the same protocol. Blood lactate (BLa), heart rate (HR), and blood pressure (BP) were measured preexercise, with BLa measured a second time immediately following the last set, while HR and BP were measured 5 and 10 min postexercise. Citrulline-malate ingestion significantly increased the amount of repetitions performed for each exercise (chin-ups: PL = 28.4 ± 7.1, CM = 32.2 ± 5.6, p = .003; reverse chin-ups: PL = 26.6 ± 5.6, CM = 32.1 ± 7.1, p = .017; push-ups: PL = 89.1 ± 37.4, CM = 97.7 ± 36.1, p < .001). Blood lactate data indicated a time effect (p < .001), but no treatment differences (p = .935). Systolic BP data did not show differences for time (p = .078) or treatment (p = .119). Diastolic BP data did not show differences for time (p = .069), but indicated treatment differences (p = .014) for subjects ingesting CM. Collectively, these findings suggests that CM increased upper-body resistance performance in trained college-age males.  aPublisher supplied data 3aathletic performance 3ablood 3ablood pressure 3aheart rate 3aingestion 3alactic acid 3aplacebos 3astrength training 0aergogenic aid 0anutrition 0asupplement1 aKavazis, Andreas N.1 aLuckett, William0 tJournal of dietary supplements.g2016 May 3, v. 13, no. 3 p.269-282dInforma HealthcarewJournal:2249x1939-022X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3109/19390211.2015.10086153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03928naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001200151245008400163300001800247520196100265536021802226592002802444596002302472596002302495650003902518650002002557650002002577650002102597650001802618650002402636650002102660650001602681650003102697650001702728650002002745650001002765650001602775650003702791650002502828650000902853650001502862651001002877653002902887653000902916653000902925653001902934653002102953653001802974700001702992700001803009700001603027700001303043700001603056700001803072773012903090856008603219852000903305655001203314IND60721054220221119191916.0210506e20201201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072105422DNAL7 a10.1080/19440049.2020.18286252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Min10aDietary exposure to mineral oil hydrocarbons of Chinese infants aged 0-6 months  ap. 2070-2081.  aConsumers are exposed to a range of mineral oil hydrocarbons (MOH) via food. The potential adverse health effect of MOH varies widely. Since infant formula (IF) is the major food source for infants, it is necessary to understand MOH exposure and consequent health impact. In the present study, occurrence data of 42 IF samples and food consumption data of 0–6 months infants from China National Food Consumption Survey in 2015 were linked to evaluate the dietary exposure to MOH of 0–6 months infants in China. Ordinary consumers (who purchased IF for 0–6 months infants in different packaging type randomly), packaging type loyal- and brand loyal-consumers were selected as three representative populations. For ordinary consumers and packaging-loyal consumers, dietary exposure to MOH was estimated both deterministically and probabilistically. For brand-loyal consumers, point-estimation was used as the exposure assessment method. Due to toxicological gaps for MOHs, it was inappropriate to derive health-based guidance value and perform the robust human health risk assessment. MOE approach was used to characterise MOSH risk. The no-observed-adverse-effect level for induction of liver microgranulomas, 19 mg/kg BW per day, was used as a reference point for calculating margins of exposure (MOEs) for MOSH exposure. Although first exposure occurs in babies, there are no relevant toxicology studies. All MOE values for different scenarios were higher than 100. There are no dose-response data on the carcinogenicity of MOAH mixtures and hence it is not possible to establish a reference point to calculate the MOE and characterise its risk. Therefore, it is not possible to draw conclusions about the full nature of possible concerns for infants aged 0–6 months. This study evaluates by a probabilistic approach the dietary intake of Chinese infants aged 0–6 months to MOH for the first time and describes the associated uncertainties.  aThis work was financially supported by Guangdong Key R&D Program [No. 2019B020210002] from Department of Science and Technology of Guangdong Province and the National Key R&D Program of China [No. 2018YFC1603104].  aPublisher supplied data  aNo. 2019B020210002  aNo. 2018YFC1603104 3aNationwide Food Consumption Survey 3aadverse effects 3acarcinogenicity 3adietary exposure 3adose response 3aexposure assessment 3afood consumption 3afood intake 3ahealth effects assessments 3ahuman health 3ainfant formulas 3aliver 3amineral oil 3ano observed adverse effect level 3aprobability analysis 3arisk 3atoxicology 3aChina 0aMineral oil hydrocarbons 0aMOSH 0aMOAH 0ainfant formula 0adietary exposure 0aprobabilistic1 aYing, Xuanyu1 aYang, Chunyan1 aLi, Jianwen1 aGao, Jie1 aSui, Haixia1 aQian, Zhiyong0 tFood additives & contaminants.g2020 Dec. 01, v. 37, no. 12 p.2070-2081dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl35737x1944-00577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/19440049.2020.18286253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02086naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245011100170300001500281500001900296520098300315592002801298650001601326650001801342650002201360650001701382650003901399650001601438650001701454650001801471650001901489700002001508773011801528856008101646852000901727655001201736IND60729558920221120031937.0210228e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072955892DNAL7 a10.1134/S19950829200600612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrigoryeva, N.

Microcystis and sp. Synechocystis has been studied. Since heavy metals impact causes blocking of light-energy transmission channels and arrest of electron transport in photosynthetic apparatus of cyanobacteria, their influence can be detected within a few hours by fluorescence techniques. In this investigation three standard fluorescence techniques are used: fluorescence spectroscopy, pulsed amplitude modulation fluorimetry, and confocal microscopic spectroscopy. All three used methods showed a decrease in photosynthetic activity for cyanobacterial cells exposed to heavy metals. However, the mechanisms of action for different heavy metals are slightly different. In this paper, we analyze variations in spectroscopic and kinetic properties of emmitted fluorescence for cyanobacterial cultures and single living cells in order to identify a specific mechanism of heavy metals influence.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMicrocystis 3aSynechocystis 3aelectron transfer 3afluorescence 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3afluorometry 3aheavy metals 3ainland waters 3aphotosynthesis1 aZaytseva, T.

Healthy soils facilitate food and water security, assist nutrient cycling, support thriving microbial communities, and act as a carbon sink. Due to lack of awareness of soil importance, resource constraints, and complexity, soil is often overlooked in restoration planning, implementation, and monitoring. Prioritizing soil by placing its restoration and monitoring at the heart of projects will provide the foundation for resilient ecosystems. Soil restoration offers opportunities for interdisciplinary research, enabling inclusive and collaborative solutions to meet the UN Sustainable Development Goals of zero hunger, clean water and sanitation, climate action, and life on land. Changing approaches to project funding, increasing people's connection and understanding of soils through education, and creating spaces to discuss soil's importance are ways to raise soil's profile to that of big‐ticket fauna.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon sinks 3aclimate 3ahunger 3ainterdisciplinary research 3asanitation 3asoil 3asoil restoration 3asustainable development 3awater security1 aStanton, Katy Jo1 aEvans, Kathryn1 aPym, Liz1 aKaufman, Breanna1 aDuley, Emma0 tRestoration ecology.g2021 Nov., v. 29, no. 8 p.e13453-dWiley Periodicals, Inc.wJournal:jnl3867104x1061-29717nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/rec.134533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02140naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245007700164300001600241520095600257592002801213650001401241650001101255650001901266650002101285650001101306650002501317650001901342651001001361653001801371653001801389653002801407653002601435653002501461700002401486773015301510856008201663852000901745655001201754IND60744036520221119173644.0220207e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074403652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.spc.2021.06.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Boqiang10aDoes energy poverty affect the well-being of people: Evidence from Ghana  ap. 675-685.  aDeemed as a multifaceted problem, energy poverty results in multiple forms of vulnerabilities. Using data on Ghana, we test the social vulnerability aspect of energy poverty by estimating its effect on subjective social status. Instrumenting energy poverty with energy prices, we observe a quadratic (U-shaped) relationship between multidimensional energy poverty and social status. This relationship is consistent across rural-urban and male-headed subgroups. Thus, further deprivation in modern energy services does not deteriorate one's social image but rather enhances it. Additionally, we find household income and education as essential channels through which energy poverty affects subjective social status. With existing global policies currently running to eradicate energy poverty, other approaches that aim to increase household income and education can reinforce each other to enhance the social image and increase household energy access.  aPublisher supplied data 3aeducation 3aenergy 3aenergy poverty 3ahousehold income 3apeople 3asocioeconomic status 3asocioeconomics 3aGhana 0aSocial status 0aVulnerability 0aNon-linear relationship 0aFractional regression 0aU-shaped association1 aOkyere, Michael Adu0 tSustainable Production and Consumption.g2021 Oct., v. 28 p.675-685dElsevier LtdaInstitution of Chemical EngineerswJournal:23261x2352-55097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.spc.2021.06.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03098naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006000139245012100199500002000320520172500340592002802065596008602093650001502179650001502194650001902209650002302228650001502251650001702266651001402283651001802297700002602315700002302341700002302364700002302387700002202410700006302432773012202495856007402617852000902691655001202700IND60758590820221121070301.0211130e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075859082DNAL7 a10.1111/rec.134522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMontiel, Rosario1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5089-097810aEucalypt plantations for forest restoration in a fire‐prone mosaic of grasslands and forests in northern Argentina  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIn ecosystems with grassland‐forest boundaries, tree plantations could be used to promote forest restoration. In the Humid Chaco region of central South America, fire is one of the main disturbances that shapes the landscape. As eucalypt plantations are flammable, the contribution they can make to forest restoration is questionable. We planted saplings of five native tree species in three different environments (forests, grasslands, and eucalypt plantations) and assessed microclimatic conditions likely to influence sapling survival and growth. After 1 year, accidental fires that affected much of the study area allowed us to investigate the susceptibility of different environments to fire occurrence and post‐fire sapling survival. We planted 600 saplings in four plots per environment. We evaluated fire occurrence in the study area for 2 years and ask whether this factor affects sapling survival. In grasslands, microclimatic conditions were more extreme than in plantations. Plantations and forests showed high pre‐fire sapling survival but growth was almost double in plantations, similar to grasslands for most species. In the study area, fire frequency was similar in plantations and grasslands, whereas forests plots never burnt during the 2‐year study period. Fire reduced sapling survival in plantations, but not in grasslands where survival was low and similar in burned and unburned plots. For top‐killed plants, post‐fire resprouting ability was species‐specific. While more firm conclusions await future studies with even larger sample sizes, our results indicate that fire management may be necessary in order to use eucalypt plantations as nurses in this fire‐prone ecosystem.  aPublisher supplied data  cCONICET (Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas, Argentina) 3aEucalyptus 3aecosystems 3afire frequency 3aforest restoration 3alandscapes 3amicroclimate 3aArgentina 3aEl Gran Chaco1 aZaninovich, Silvia C.1 aBedrij, Natalia A.1 aInsaurralde, Ariel1 aVerdoljak, Juan J.1 aFontana, José L.1 aGatti, Ma.

This paper utilizes the statistical data of industrial enterprises in China during the period of 2011–2018 to explore the technological innovation value chain efficiency under the background of the new development stage. This study divides the innovation value chain into technological innovation stage and the economic conversion stage. The network slacks-based measure (NSBM) approach is applied to calculate the two different stages’ efficiency. LSDV is utilized to analyze the influence mechanism of technological innovation factors on industrial energy intensity. The main results are as follows: first, the development trend of technological innovation efficiency (TIE) and the economic conversion efficiency (ECE) has heterogeneous effect across economic regions. The comprehensive development trend of innovation value chain in central China is the best among the four economic regions. Second, the effect of TIE on industrial energy intensity is negative, while the ECE is positive related to industrial energy intensity. In terms of technology spillover effect, the impact of import and FDI on industrial energy intensity is negative, respectively. The relationship between export and energy intensity is positive. The energy price has the negative relationship with industrial energy intensity, and the impact of energy price on industrial energy intensity is the largest. Through analyzing the efficiency of innovation value chain and the influence mechanism of technological innovation factors on energy intensity, this paper puts forwards relevant countermeasures and suggestions for effectively reducing industrial energy intensity and promoting high-quality industrial sustainable development. In addition, relevant theoretical research is provided for the sustainable green development.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3aenergy 3aenergy costs 3aexports 3aimports 3asupply chain 3asustainable development 3atechnology 3aChina 0aIndustrial energy intensity 0aTechnological innovation efficiency 0aEconomic conversion efficiency 0aTechnological spillovers 0aLSDV1 aXue, Yang,1 aWen, Zonguo0 tSustainable Production and Consumption.g2021 Oct., v. 28 p.775-785dElsevier LtdwJournal:23261x2352-55097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.spc.2021.06.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03585naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006600139245007800205500001100283520179000294592002802084596007702112596007702189596007702266596007702343596007702420596007702497650001902574650002702593650001802620650001702638650001302655650002202668700006102690700003402751700002202785700003702807700007102844700003102915773012202946856007403068852000903142655001203151IND60758590920221121070209.0211130e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075859092DNAL7 a10.1111/rec.134962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRomanelli, João Paulo1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8011-207710aRepeatability of the searching process in reviews of restoration outcomes  aREVIEW  aIn the recently declared United Nations Decade on Ecosystem Restoration (2021–2030), evidence‐based research has an essential role in summarizing restoration outcomes toward broad generalizations to advance restoration practice and science globally. However, to present trustworthy, high‐quality recommendations, evidence reviews should be based on rigorous methods that minimize bias and enhance systematicity, transparency, objectivity, comprehensiveness, and repeatability. To assess the current value of restoration reviews in terms of methodological repeatability at the searching stage, a fundamental review stage, we evaluated a sample of meta‐analyses and narrative syntheses (n = 79) and critically appraised how searches were conducted based on the information reported within each study. By assessing whether review methods were reported in sufficient detail to be repeated by an independent party, we found that repeatability varied substantially by the standard we used. Overall, reviews performed relatively poorly, with a median score of 3 out of 9 points available, and a mean score of 3.6. Most reviews (n = 76/79) failed in effectively reporting all necessary information to allow repeatability at this stage. We found no statistically significant differences considering review types, suggesting that the type of synthesis alone does not solely reflect the repeatability of a review. Toward increasingly repeatable, reliable reviews in restoration ecology, we recommend that authors incorporate and apply principles of systematic reviews and maps in their review process, and suggest that environmental journals should broadly emphasize ways of performing rigorous reviews, as well as increase efforts for the publication of open access review protocols.  aPublisher supplied data  a2013/50718‐5cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo  a2018/18416‐2cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo  a2018/21338‐3cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo  a2019/08533‐4cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo  a2019/23908‐4cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo  a2019/24049‐5cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo 3aUnited Nations 3aecological restoration 3ameta-analysis 3apublications 3asampling 3asystematic review1 aSilva, Luiz G.

Twenty-seven specimens of Bufo stomaticus (Lutken, 1864) (Anura: Bufonidae) were collected in the Dir Lower, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan in the period from April to August 2016, and examined for helminths (endoparasites) parasites. Twelve (44.44%) specimens were infected by two types of helminths parasites. Total of forty-one helminths parasites were collected, among them six were identified Cestode and the remaining thirty-five were nematodes. The dominant parasites were nematodes (Cosmocerca sp. with 56.09% followed by Cosmocercoides sp. with 29.26%). But the Cestodes were found with single species (Nematotania dispar with 14.63%). Female toads showed higher parasite diversity than male toads.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBufo 3aCestoda 3aNematoda 3afemales 3ahelminths 3ainland waters 3amales 3atoads 3aPakistan1 aAttaullah, M.1 aKhan, W.1 aWaris, A.1 aKhalid, Sh.1 aBaset, A.0 tInland water biology.g2021 Jan., v. 14, no. 1 p.121-124dPleiades PublishingwJournal:J000000086x1995-08297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S19950829210100413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02450naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002700147245020300174300001200377520087800389592002801267596004901295650002001344650001701364650001801381650001501399650002001414650001201434650001201446650001301458650001501471650001101486650001501497650001301512650001701525650001401542650000901556650001101565650001401576650000701590650000901597650001701606650001101623700002201634700001701656700002601673773014201699856008201841852000901923655001201932IND60678069320221121021529.0200503e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067806932DNAL7 a10.1007/s11270-019-4350-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aŚwiątek, Bartłomiej10aBioaccumulation of Heavy Metals (Pb, Cd, Cr, Cu) in Fine Roots Under Three Species of Alders (Alnus spp.) Plantation at Different Soil Substrates Addition on the Reclaimed Combustion Wastes Landfill  ap. 297.  aIn the study, we have analysed the impact of lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr) and copper (Cu) on fine root biomass and the associated level of bioacumulation heavy metals in fine roots under alder plantings (Alnus incana, A. glutinosa and A. viridis) growing on technosols developed from combustion wastes and extremely poor quaternary sands excavated by sand mining. The control sites were located in natural habitats in the Bieszczady Mountains within the natural range of the occurrence of the investigated alder species. Results showed that the bioaccumulation index of heavy metals in the alder roots depended on technosol properties, in particular, pH and texture, and, to a lesser extent, on the total content of heavy metals in soil. Additionally, it was found that in some concentration ranges, Pb and Cr had a stimulating effect on the growth of fine roots.  aPublisher supplied data  a2015/17/B/ST10/02712cNarodowe Centrum Nauki 3aAlnus glutinosa 3aAlnus incana 3aAlnus viridis 3aTechnosols 3abioaccumulation 3abiomass 3acadmium 3achromium 3acombustion 3acopper 3afine roots 3ahabitats 3aheavy metals 3alandfills 3alead 3amining 3amountains 3apH 3asand 3asoil texture 3awastes1 aWoś, Bartłomiej1 aGruba, Piotr1 aPietrzykowski, Marcin0 tWater, air, and soil pollution.g2019 Dec., v. 230, no. 12 p.297-297dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl4876x0049-69797nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-019-4350-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02279naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001800094024004400112040001800156100001600174245006600190300001600256520098000272592002801252650001301280650001101293650001501304650001701319650001201336650001601348650003701364650000901401650001201410650005301422650001101475650001601486650001301502650005201515650002401567650000901591650002101600700001801621700001701639773009901656856005701755852000901812655001201821IND50068283720221121203216.0130802e199004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006828372DNAL7 a16967962pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-2052.1990.tb03220.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKEMP, S.

Family and population studies, antibody binding inhibition and immunoprecipitation of the target antigen all indicate that ILA70 detects a polymorphic epitope on a bovine class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecule. The antibody is complement fixing and so may be used in a standard cytotoxicity assay. Ascitic fluid with antibody activity many times greater than that of the tissue‐culture supernatant has been prepared in nude mice. The antibody‐producing heterohybridoma has been subcloned three times and appears to be stable. Such heterohybridomas may prove to be a valuable source of particularly discriminating and informative mAbs for the serological analysis of the products of the bovine MHC.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantigens 3acalves 3acomplement 3acytotoxicity 3aheifers 3alymphocytes 3amajor histocompatibility complex 3amice 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Monoclonalxisolation & purification 2aCattle 2aCell Fusion 2aEpitopes 2aHistocompatibility Antigens Class Iximmunology 2aIn Vitro Techniques 2aMale 2aPrecipitin Tests1 aTUCKER, E.

Walp.) is a key climate‐resilient legume for food security, especially in sub‐Saharan Africa. Cowpea yields are limited by edaphic stresses including drought and low phosphorus (P) availability. Identifying genotypes with advantageous root phenotypes can facilitate breeding for improved yield in marginal environments. We evaluated 50 elite genotypes from African and U.S. sources for seedling root architecture and root hair length and density. Significant genotypic variation was detected for all phenes, and high heritability was observed for architectural phenotypes including primary root length (77%), basal root number (72%), and taproot branching density (67%). Moderate heritability was detected for root hair length and density among different root classes (34 to 63%), which were positively associated with each other. Principal component analysis identified three clusters, primarily defined by seed dimension and seedling root architecture. Genotypes were identified with longer root hairs (TVu‐7778, Vita7, and Sanzi) and longer taproots (IT96D‐610, IT98K‐111‐1, and IT97K‐499‐35), as potential parents. Root phenotypes, grain, and fodder yield were assessed on a subset of 20 genotypes under contrasting P availability in the field. Some seedling root phenotypes were significantly related to mature plant dry fodder weight (taproot hair density) and to grain yield (lateral root hair density) under low P. Root hairs are positively related to plant productivity under low P. We suggest selection for longer primary roots, as more basal and lateral root roots may be beneficial for cowpea in drought and low P environments. These findings suggest seedling root phenotypes can support cowpea breeding for suboptimal environments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVigna unguiculata 3acowpeas 3adrought 3afood security 3aforage 3agenetic variation 3agrain yield 3aheritability 3alateral roots 3amature plants 3aphenotype 3aphosphorus 3aprincipal component analysis 3aroot hairs 3aseedlings 3atap roots 3aSub-Saharan Africa1 aBurridge, James D.1 aIshiyaku, Mohammad F.1 aBoukar, Ousmane1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0234-42641 aLynch, Jonathan P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7265-97900 tCrop science.g2022 Jan., v. 62, no. 1 p.326-345dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44570x0011-183X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/csc2.206353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01465naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245011000155300001600265520042400281592002800705650002700733650002700760650001800787650001400805700001800819700002500837700001900862700001900881700002400900773013100924856007501055852000901130655001201139IND60760964920221118011708.0211224e20211223xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076096492DNAL7 a10.1039/d1cc06205k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYue, Erlin10aAu(i)-mediated N₂-elimination from triazaphospholes: a one-pot synthesis of novel N₂P₂-heterocycles  ap. 310-313.  aNovel tosyl- and mesitylsulfonyl-substituted triazaphospholes were synthesized and structurally characterized.

However, one of the prime reasons for a slow transition is lack of scalability of CBMs operating in the fashion retail value chain. What is lacking in the current discourse is research that summarises and condenses the literature on strategies for how scalability can be attained and what that means in context to CBMs where not only economic values are in focus. Therefore, the main purpose of this paper is to explore the main strategic approaches to scale business models and how these can be applied to CBMs in the fashion retail value chain. To do this, a two-part method is adopted consisting of a systematic literature review of 57 business models and scalability papers followed by a review of activities reported by 76 fashion retail companies on how these have, or are planning to, increase the scale of their CBM initiative. Our suggested model provides a basic understanding of strategies for business model scalability seen from four different business model design perspectives. These are further contextualised for CBMs in the fashion value chain and lessons learned are generated in the form of four central propositions. The propositions account on how organisations can leverage resources from their existing conventional business model for efficient scaling of their CBM initiative, how they can consider strategic partnerships to access complementary resources, while also embarking on adaptability by running business pilots either internally or by engaging in collaborative networks for industry-wide learnings and change.  aPublisher supplied data 3acircular economy 3aindustry 3apollution 3asupply chain 3awastes 0aCircular business model 0aFashion industry 0aScalability 0aRetail value chain1 aPal, Rudrajeet0 tSustainable Production and Consumption.g2021 Oct., v. 28 p.686-698dElsevier LtdwJournal:23261x2352-55097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.spc.2021.06.0333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02933naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001200112245008700124300001600211500001400227520152900241592002801770650001201798650003001810650001601840650001001856650001301866650001701879650001801896650001401914650002401928650001501952650001201967650001101979650001001990650001202000650001502012650001102027650001002038650001502048650001202063650001602075650001002091651001002101653000902111653002202120653002702142700001602169700001602185700001402201773016702215852000902382655001202391IND60710374820221117162342.0200908e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071037482DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRai, B.10aLivelihood security through improved goat rearing practices under field conditions  ap. 198-201.  aNAL-light  aData were collected from randomly selected 147 goat-rearing households from Raebareli and Barabanki districts of Uttar Pradesh. Ninety percent goat keepers belonged to socio-economically backward communities with their major source of income as labour. Goats were looked after mainly by women and children in the families. All the farmers had non-descript goats maintained on grazing and crop residues. The average flock size was 3.24 in Barabanki and 2.84 in Raebareli district. No separate housing was available for goats and kept in human dwellings. The awareness and adoption levels about improved goat rearing practices such as breeding, strategic and supplementary feeding of concentrates, deworming and vaccination, etc., were negligible. Average gross income was Rs. 2465/goat/yr. Bucks of Sirohi and Barbari breeds were provided to the selected farmers as one of the interventions under Sustainable Livelihood Component-3 of National Agriculture Innovation Project (NAIP) to improve the income and employment of the poor farmers by increasing the productivity of goats. The study revealed 28% increase in income through introduction of Sirohi over non-descript goats along with improved management practices. The study suggested that a unit of 5 Sirohi goats with improved management practices could provide additional income of about Rs 18000 – 22000 in first year which may likely to increase with the increase in flock size and create employment of > 228 man days per year to sustain livelihood of poor people.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBarbari 3aadministrative management 3aagriculture 3abucks 3achildren 3aconcentrates 3acrop residues 3adeworming 3adietary supplements 3aemployment 3afarmers 3aflocks 3agoats 3agrazing 3ahouseholds 3aincome 3alabor 3alivelihood 3arearing 3avaccination 3awomen 3aIndia 0aGoat 0aIncome generation 0aProduction performance1 aSingh, M.K.1 aDixit, A.K.1 aRai, R.B.0 tIndian journal of small ruminants.g2013 Oct., v. 19, no. 2 p.198-201dIndian Society for Sheep and Goat Production and UtilizationwJournal:2092x0973-97187nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02603naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001900164245013500183300001600318520092700334592002801261650002901289650001101318650001401329650001401343650002901357650001401386650002001400650001301420650001201433650001101445650001901456650001901475650001201494650001601506650001101522650003601533650003801569650004501607650002201652650002001674650002201694650001401716650004101730651001101771651001101782700001801793700002001811700002001831773012901851856004801980852000902028655001202037IND4474530720221121235926.0120727e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447453072DNAL7 a219222842pmid7 a10.1007/s00128-011-0399-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLacerda, L.

The EF reached 83.5 mg ha−1 cycle−1 (about 175 mg ha−1 year−1), resulting in an annual Hg load to the estuary of 0.35 kg. The calculated EF is comparable to Hg EFs from urban wastewaters (200 mg ha−1) and solid waste disposal (400 mg ha−1 year−1) from cities located in the estuary’s basin. However, due to the smaller area of aquaculture (2,010 ha), total annual loads are much lower than from these other sources (75 and 150 kg year−1, respectively). Since shrimp farming effluents are released directly into the estuary, the estimated high EF raises environmental concerns with this expanding industry, suggesting the inclusion of this element in ongoing environmental monitoring programs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropogenic activities 3acities 3aeffluents 3aemissions 3aenvironmental monitoring 3aestuaries 3afarming systems 3aindustry 3amercury 3arivers 3ashrimp culture 3awaste disposal 2aAnimals 2aAquaculture 2aCities 2aCrustaceaxgrowth & development 2aEnvironmental Monitoringxmethods 2aGeologic Sedimentsxanalysisxchemistry. 2aMercuryxanalysis 2aRefuse Disposal 2aRiversxchemistry 2aShellfish 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysis 3aBrazil 0aBrazil1 aSoares, T.

Human milk (HM) is rich in a multitude of bioactive factors that play major roles in promoting postnatal maturation, differentiation, and the development of the microbiome. Previous studies showed that HM is rich in hyaluronan (HA) especially in colostrum and early milk. This study aims to determine the role of HA 35 KDa, a HM HA mimic, on intestinal proliferation, differentiation, and the development of the intestinal microbiome. We show that oral HA 35 KDa supplementation for 7 days in mouse pups leads to increased villus length and crypt depth, and increased goblet and Paneth cells, compared to controls. We also show that HA 35 KDa leads to an increased predominance of Clostridiales Ruminococcaceae, Lactobacillales Lactobacillaceae, and Clostridiales Lachnospiraceae. In seeking the mechanisms involved in the changes, bulk RNA seq was performed on samples from the terminal ileum and identified upregulation in several genes essential for cellular growth, proliferation, and survival. Taken together, this study shows that HA 35 KDa supplemented to mouse pups promotes intestinal epithelial cell proliferation, as well as the development of Paneth cells and goblet cell subsets. HA 35 KDa also impacted the intestinal microbiota; the implications of these responses need to be determined.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLachnospiraceae 3aLactobacillaceae 3aRNA 3aRuminococcaceae 3abreast milk 3acell growth 3acell proliferation 3acolostrum 3aenterocolitis 3aepithelial cells 3ahyaluronic acid 3aileum 3aintestinal microorganisms 3amice 3amicrobiome 3amilk 3avilli1 aBurge, Kathryn 1 aEckert, Jeffrey 1 aTrammell, MaJoi 1 aDyer, David 1 aKeshari, Ravi S.1 aSilasi, Robert 1 aRegmi, Girija 1 aLupu, Cristina 1 aGood, Misty 1 aMcElroy, Steven J.1 aLupu, Florea 0 tNutrients.g2021 June 12, v. 13, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu130620303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02179naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002900112245008000141300001600221500001400237520112700251592002801378650003001406650000801436650002301444650001601467650002301483650001401506650001001520650001001530650001201540650001201552653001101564653001101575700002101586700002201607773016701629852000901796655001201805IND60710375020221117162314.0200908e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071037502DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRamakrishnappa, Nagaraja10aInfluence of weaning age on post-weaning growth performance in mandya lambs  ap. 208-210.  aNAL-light  aThis study investigated the influence of weaning age on post-weaning growth in Mandya lambs maintained under intensive system of management. Post-weaning performance was assessed based on the changes in live weight and average daily gain (ADG). A total of 39 lambs were randomly allocated to one of the three groups (Gr-I: lambs weaned at the age of eighth week; Gr-II: lambs weaned at tenth week of age and Gr-III: lambs weaned at twelfth week of age). In all the lambs body weights were recorded on bi-weekly basis until 24ᵗʰ week of age. Data revealed no significant difference (P>0.05) in post-weaning growth either in terms of live body weight or ADG, between the groups. However, in terms of gender effect, the overall growth in male lambs during post-weaning was significantly higher than that offemale lambs (P<0.05). The present study demonstrated that young Mandya lambs, at an age as early as two months could be successfully weaned. This system of lamb rearing could be a value addition in terms of accomplishing best possible post-weaning growth while reducing prolonged and undue lactation stress on dams.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadministrative management 3aage 3aaverage daily gain 3abody weight 3agrowth performance 3alactation 3alambs 3amales 3arearing 3aweaning 0aGrowth 0aMandya1 aKumar, S.

However, few studies have compared pipelines from locus discovery and bait design, through validation, to tree inference. We compared three methods within Leguminosae (Fabaceae) and present a workflow for future efforts. METHODS: Using 30 transcriptomes, we compared Hyb‐Seq, MarkerMiner, and the Yang and Smith (Y&S) pipelines for locus discovery, validated 7501 baits targeting 507 loci across 25 genera via Illumina sequencing, and inferred gene and species trees via concatenation‐ and coalescent‐based methods. RESULTS: Hyb‐Seq discovered loci with the longest mean length. MarkerMiner discovered the most conserved loci with the least flagged as paralogous. Y&S offered the most parsimony‐informative sites and putative orthologs. Target recovery averaged 93% across taxa. We optimized our targeted locus set based on a workflow designed to minimize paralog/ortholog conflation and thus present 423 loci for legume phylogenomics. CONCLUSIONS: Methods differed across criteria important for phylogenetic marker development. We recommend Hyb‐Seq as a method that may be useful for most phylogenomic projects. Our targeted locus set is a resource for future, community‐driven efforts to reconstruct the legume tree of life.  aPublisher supplied data  aDEB‐1352217cU.S. National Science Foundation  aDEB‐0948800cU.S. National Science Foundation  cScholarly Studies and Global Genome Initiative 3aFabaceae 3agenes 3alegumes 3aloci 3aphylogeny 3atranscriptome1 aPowell, Adrian1 aDoyle, Jeff J.1 aEgan, Ashley N.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7803-44440 tApplications in plant sciences.g2018 Mar., v. 6, no. 3 p.e1036-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:19710x2168-04507nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/aps3.10363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03066naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245010000166300001600266500001400282520148000296592002801776650001001804650001101814650000801825650001401833650001001847650002301857650002401880650001201904650001001916650000901926650002001935650001601955650001401971650001101985650001301996651001002009653002402019653001502043653001202058653001702070700002102087700001802108700001702126700001902143700001602162700002002178700001502198700002102213700001402234700001402248700001402262773009702276856008202373852000902455655001202464IND60723598520221118182257.0210115e20201231xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072359852DNAL7 a10.3897/zookeys.1008.564122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLyu, Jing-Cai12aA new species of the genus Leptobrachella Smith, 1925 (Anura, Megophryidae) from Guizhou, China  ap. 139-157.  aNAL-light  aAsian leaf-litter toads of the genus Leptobrachella represent charismatic anuran diversification with 80 species, of which 25 are from China. Recent new discoveries suggest that the diversity of this genus is underestimated. Here, we describe a new species of Leptobrachella , Leptobrachella bashaensis sp. nov. from the Basha Nature Reserve, Congjiang County, Guizhou Province, China. The new species is distinguished from its congeners by the following suite of morphological traits: small body size (SVL 22.9–25.6 mm in six adult males and 27.1 mm in one adult female); head longer than wide; dorsal skin slightly shagreened with small tubercles; creamy-white chest and belly with irregular black spots; distinct ventrolateral glands forming a white line; finger webbing and fringes absent; toe webbing rudimentary and lateral fringes narrow; iris bicolored with bright orange in upper half and silver in lower half; dorsal surface of tadpole head dark brown with small, brown, irregular spot, air sac-shaped bulges on both sides of body. The new species differs from all known congeners by an uncorrected p-distance of >5.3% of the 16S rRNA gene fragment examined, and the phylogenetic analysis clusters the new species with L. maoershanensis and L. laui. At present, the new species is only known from a small range of montane evergreen secondary forests in Basha Nature Reserve approximately 900 m elevation. Its natural history and conservation status are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnura 3aadults 3aair 3abody size 3achest 3aconservation areas 3aconservation status 3afemales 3agenes 3ahead 3anatural history 3anew species 3aphylogeny 3asilver 3atadpoles 3aChina 0aIntegrated taxonomy 0amorphology 0atadpole 0avocalization1 aDai, Liang-Liang1 aWei, Ping-Fan1 aHe, Yan-Hong1 aYuan, Zhi-Yong1 aShi, Wen-Li1 aZhou, Sheng-Lun1 aRan, Si-Yu1 aKuang, Zhong-Fan1 aGuo, Xuan1 aWei, Gang1 aYuan, Guo0 tZooKeys.g2020 Dec. 31, v. 1008 p.139-157dPensoft PublisherswJournal:2141x1313-29707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3897/zookeys.1008.564123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03962naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002900149245019400178520178600372592002802158650003202186650001702218650001602235650001802251650001002269650001302279650001702292650001402309650001402323650001502337650002402352653000802376653000702384653000802391653000902399653000902408653000902417653000902426653000902435653000902444653000802453653000802461653000902469653000802478653000902486653000702495653001002502653000902512653000902521653001902530653003002549653002102579653002902600700003202629700002602661700005802687700005902745700006302804700003902867700006102906700003702967700002903004773012603033856008403159852000903243655001203252IND60741544420221118104248.0220207e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074154442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.syapm.2021.1262232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVolpiano, Camila Gazolla10aProposal of Carbonactinosporaceae fam. nov. within the class Actinomycetia. Reclassification of Streptomyces thermoautotrophicus as Carbonactinospora thermoautotrophica gen. nov., comb. nov  aStreptomyces thermoautotrophicus UBT1ᵀ has been suggested to merit generic status due to its phylogenetic placement and distinctive phenotypes among Actinomycetia. To evaluate whether ‘S. thermoautotrophicus’ represents a higher taxonomic rank, ‘S. thermoautotrophicus’ strains UBT1ᵀ and H1 were compared to Actinomycetia using 16S rRNA gene sequences and comparative genome analyses. The UBT1ᵀ and H1 genomes each contain at least two different 16S rRNA sequences, which are closely related to those of Acidothermus cellulolyticus (order Acidothermales). In multigene-based phylogenomic trees, UBT1ᵀ and H1 typically formed a sister group to the Streptosporangiales-Acidothermales clade. The Average Amino Acid Identity, Percentage of Conserved Proteins, and whole-genome Average Nucleotide Identity (Alignment Fraction) values were ≤58.5%, ≤48%, ≤75.5% (0.3) between ‘S. thermoautotrophicus’ and Streptosporangiales members, all below the respective thresholds for delineating genera. The values for genomics comparisons between strains UBT1ᵀ and H1 with Acidothermales, as well as members of the genus Streptomyces, were even lower. A review of the ‘S. thermoautotrophicus’ proteomic profiles and KEGG orthology demonstrated that UBT1ᵀ and H1 present pronounced differences, both tested and predicted, in phenotypic and chemotaxonomic characteristics compared to its sister clades and Streptomyces. The distinct phylogenetic position and the combination of genotypic and phenotypic characteristics justify the proposal of Carbonactinospora gen. nov., with the type species Carbonactinospora thermoautotrophica comb. nov. (type strain UBT1ᵀ, = DSM 100163ᵀ = KCTC 49540ᵀ) belonging to Carbonactinosporaceae fam. nov. within Actinomycetia.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcidothermus cellulolyticus 3aStreptomyces 3aamino acids 3achemotaxonomy 3agenes 3agenomics 3amicrobiology 3aphenotype 3aphylogeny 3aproteomics 3ataxonomic revisions 0aAAI 0aAF 0aANI 0aANIb 0aBBHs 0aCDSs 0adDDH 0agANI 0aGBDP 0aHGT 0aKOs 0aLPSN 0aLTP 0aMiSI 0aML 0aNISEs 0aPOCP 0aTYGS 0aActinobacteria 0aChemoautotrophic bacteria 0aGenomics metrics 0aPhylogenetic systematics1 aSant'Anna, Fernando Hayashi1 ada Mota, Fábio Faria1 aSangal, Vartul1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7405-84461 aSutcliffe, Iain1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9036-26831 aMunusamy, Madhaiyan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0274-89311 aSaravanan, Venkatakrishnan Sivaraj1 aSee-Too, Wah-Seng1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0843-18951 aPassaglia, Luciane Maria Pereira1 aRosado, Alexandre Soares0 tSystematic and applied microbiology.g2021 July, v. 44, no. 4 p.126223-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl34624x0723-20207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.syapm.2021.1262233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02618naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002100112245007400133300001600207500001400223520145300237592002801690650001301718650001801731650001301749650002001762650002201782650000901804650001501813650003301828650002801861650003701889650001201926653002301938653001601961653001901977700002601996700002202022773016702044852000902211655001202220IND60710375320221117162322.0200908e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071037532DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMohan, K.

A total of 120 postpartum, parous and healthy ewes aged between 2 and 5 years were selected and divided into five groups. The ewes were synchronized with vaginal sponges containing 30 mg of flurogestone acetate. Gr I ewes were considered as untreated control. Ewes in Gr II (VS4) were treated with intra-vaginal sponges and were left in place for 12 days followed by intramuscular injection of 400 IU of pregnant mare serum gonadotropin (PMSG) at the time of sponge removal. Ewes in Gr III (VS6) were treated with vaginal sponge and 600 IU of PMSG was given intramuscularly at the time of removal of sponge. Ewes in Gr IV (VS4h) were treated as in Gr II except 200 IU of human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) injection at the time of mating. Ewes in GrV (VS6h) were treated as in Gr III except 200 IU of HCG injection at the time of mating. There was no significant difference observed in erythrocyte count during breeding and non-breeding seasons in the ewes treated with vaginal sponges. The haemoglobin levels were higher in ewes treated with vaginal sponges during breeding season compared to non-breeding season. The serum glucose levels were significantly high (P<0.01) in breeding season than non-breeding season. The study revealed that haemato-biochemical profiles were not affected in ewes synchronized with vaginal sponges.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetates 3ablood glucose 3abreeding 3abreeding season 3aerythrocyte count 3aewes 3ahemoglobin 3ahuman chorionic gonadotropin 3aintramuscular injection 3apregnant mare serum gonadotropin 3aseasons 0aBlood biochemistry 0aHaematology 0aVaginal sponge1 aSadāśivarāvu, Ke.,1 aRaju, K.G.

PBDEs pose various health problems such as thyroid hormone disruption, permanent learning and memory impairment, behavioral changes, hearing deficits, delayed puberty onset, fetal malformations, and possibly cancer. Many measurements of PBDEs in various matrices from Sweden, Holland, Japan, the USA, and elsewhere have been reported, but few measurements are available for India. In this study, a preliminary screening of different congeners of PBDEs has been performed in different old electronic and consumer products with an objective to build capacity in order to analyze PBDEs and BFRs. Six different samples, foam from upholstery, motherboard of a computer, children toy composite sample, old vanishing window blind sample, electrical wire sample, and PVC flooring sample, were collected and analyzed for the presence of the following PBDE congeners: BDE-28, BDE-47, BDE-99, BDE-100, BDE-153, BDE-154, BDE-183, and BDE-209. It was found that three out of six samples were positive for the presence of PBDEs. Three congeners were detected in the samples, i.e., BDE-47, BDE-153, and BDE-209, of which, highest concentration was of BDE-209. Among the samples, motherboard of computer showed the highest concentration of BDE-209 followed by window blind and foam from upholstery. The results of this preliminary investigation indicate that PBDEs are still present in the old consumer products which can be an important additional source of exposure to the population.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabnormal development 3aat-risk population 3achildren 3aflame retardants 3afoams 3ahearing 3amemory 3apollutants 3apolybrominated diphenyl ethers 3apolymers 3apuberty 3ascreening 3athyroid hormones 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aFlame Retardantsxanalysis 2aHalogenated Diphenyl Ethersxanalysis 2aHazardous Substancesxanalysis 2aManufactured Materialsxanalysis 2aPlay and Playthings 2aPolybrominated Biphenylsxanalysis 3aIndia 3aJapan 3aSweden 3aUnited States 0aIndia1 aSharma, Jitendra K.1 aKanade, Gajanan S.1 aKashyap, Sanjay M1 aJuwarkar, Asha A.1 aWate, Satish R.0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2014 May, v. 186, no. 5 p.3001-3009dSpringer-Verlagx0167-63697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-013-3596-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03091naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100006000149245012500209520135400334592002801688650001501716650001301731650000901744650001601753650001301769650001401782650001201796650001701808650002101825650001001846650001201856650001601868650001901884650001401903650000701917650003001924650001901954650001301973650001401986650001602000651001902016653001302035653002502048653002302073700006002096700006002156700002102216700002102237700006002258773012602318856008402444852000902528655001202537IND60741544620221118104257.0220207e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074154462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.syapm.2021.1262252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGräßle, Fabian1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0707-236810aPelorhabdus rhamnosifermentans gen. nov., sp. nov., a strictly anaerobic rhamnose degrader from freshwater lake sediment  aA rhamnose-degrading bacterium, strain BoRhaAᵀ, was isolated from profundal sediment of Lake Constance in agar dilution series with l-rhamnose as substrate and with a background lawn of Methanospirillum hungatei. The isolated strain was a motile rod that stained Gram positive. Growth was observed within a pH range of 4.0–7.5 and a temperature range of 15–30°C. Fermentation products of rhamnose or glucose were acetate, propionate, ethanol, butyrate, and 1-propanol. The G+C content was 40.6% G+C. The dominant fatty acids are C₁₆:₁ω9c, i-C₁₃:₀3OH, C₁₆:₀ and C₁₇:₁ω8c with 8–21% relative abundance. Polar lipids were glycolipids, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphoaminolipid and other lipids, of which phosphatidylethanolamine was most abundant. The sequence of the 16S rRNA gene of the new isolate matches the sequence of its closest relative Anaerosporomusa subterranea to 92.4%. A comparison of the genome with this strain showed 60.2% genome-wide average amino acid identity (AAI), comparisons with other type strains showed a maximum of 62.7% AAI. Thus, the definition of a new genus is justified for which we propose the name Pelorhabdus. For strain BoRhaAᵀ, we propose the name Pelorhabdus rhamnosifermentans gen. nov., sp. nov., with strain BoRhaAᵀ (DSM 111565ᵀ = JCM 39158ᵀ) as the type strain.  aPublisher supplied data 3a1-propanol 3aacetates 3aagar 3aamino acids 3abacteria 3abutyrates 3aethanol 3afermentation 3afreshwater lakes 3agenes 3aglucose 3aglycolipids 3alawns and turf 3anew genus 3apH 3aphosphatidylethanolamines 3apropionic acid 3arhamnose 3asediments 3atemperature 3aLake Constance 0aRhamnose 0aAnaerobic metabolism 0aSugar fermentation1 aPlugge, Caroline1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3391-77421 aFranchini, Paolo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8184-14631 aSchink, Bernhard1 aSchleheck, David1 aMüller, Nicolai1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4801-58450 tSystematic and applied microbiology.g2021 July, v. 44, no. 4 p.126225-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl34624x0723-20207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.syapm.2021.1262253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02753naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002800149245015500177300001600332520128900348592002801637650002101665650002301686650002201709650002001731650001101751650001101762650000901773650001901782650001901801650002201820650001001842650001001852650001701862651000901879653001101888653001901899653002201918653001701940653002201957700002501979700001902004700002002023700002402043773009902067856008402166852000902250655001202259IND50069535020221120114628.0190403e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006953502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.flora.2013.07.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPool, Mohammad Ramezani10aNebkhas of Salvadora persica and their effect on the growth and survival of Prosopis cineraria, Tamarix aphylla, and Capparis decidua trees and shrubs  ap. 502-507.  aFew studies were published on the effect of nebkhas (phytogenic mounds) on species diversity and soil resources, but no detailed study has been conducted yet on possible specific influence of nebkhas on growth and survival of the plants associated with them. We studied the nebkhas of Salvadora persica and their effect on growth and survival of three woody species (Prosopis cineraria, Tamarix aphylla, and Capparis decidua) in the Ommanian coast of Hormozgan Province in the south of Iran. The results showed that mean height and mean canopy diameter of P. cineraria and T. aphylla trees and shrubs inhabiting nebkhas of Salvadora persica were considerably higher than those of plants of these species growing outside nebkhas. The reverse occurred in the case of C. decidua. Generally, the percentages of stems with dead parts were significantly lower in plants inhabiting the nebkha sites in comparison to comparable ones growing outside the nebkhas. Salvadora persica nebkhas are enriched with more soil nutrients in comparison to inter-nebkha sites. Soil accumulated per each hectare in the nebkhas of the study area dominated by trees of Salvadora persica amounted to 237.6m3. This indicates the great importance of nebkhas in the protection of soil and the associating species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCapparis decidua 3aProsopis cineraria 3aSalvadora persica 3aTamarix aphylla 3acanopy 3ashrubs 3asoil 3asoil nutrients 3asoil resources 3aspecies diversity 3astems 3atrees 3awoody plants 3aIran 0aNebkha 0aSoil resources 0aSalvadora persica 0aJegin region 0aPhytogenic mounds1 aPool, Sadegh Khazaei1 aParvaneh, Iraj1 aDehghani, Zahra1 aRostamian, Mohammad0 tFlora.g2013 Aug., v. 208, no. 8-9 p.502-507dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl51878x0367-25307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.flora.2013.07.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03920naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245012000159500002000279520241100299592002802710596004702738596004702785650001302832650001202845650001402857650001602871650001302887650002102900650001702921650001302938650001102951650002202962650002202984650001203006650001403018650002603032650001203058700002203070700002803092700002303120700002603143700002303169700002603192773012503218856007403343852000903417655001203426IND60789491320221122025012.0220821e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078949132DNAL7 a10.1002/aps3.11432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTasca, Julia A.10aHPLC‐MS detection of pyrrolizidine alkaloids and their N‐oxides in herbarium specimens dating back to the 1850s  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aPREMISE OF THE STUDY: Understanding the phylogenetic distribution of defensive plant secondary metabolites is essential to the macroevolutionary study of chemically mediated plant–animal interactions. The chemical ecology of pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs) has been extensively studied in a number of plant–herbivore systems, including Apocynaceae (the milkweed and dogbane family) and Danainae (the milkweed and clearwing butterflies). A systematic survey is necessary to establish a detailed understanding of their occurrence across Apocynaceae. A survey of this species‐rich, mainly tropical and subtropical family will rely heavily on small tissue samples removed from herbarium specimens, some of which will be very old and/or preserved with alcohols or mercuric chloride. METHODS: We optimized PA extraction methods from small leaf fragments of recently collected silica‐dried leaves of the PA‐positive Echites umbellatus, varying crushing and extraction time. We then applied our optimized method to leaf fragments from 70–167‐year‐old herbarium specimens of E. umbellatus. To simulate the effect of alcohol treatment on PA detectability in herbarium specimens, we incubated freshly collected leaves of the PA‐positive Parsonsia alboflavescens in three different alcohols before drying and compared PA recovery to freshly dried controls. PAs were quantified using high‐performance liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry analysis. X‐ray fluorescence was used to identify mercury‐containing specimens. RESULTS: Fifteen seconds of leaf crushing followed by 24 h of extraction were optimal for PA free‐base and N‐oxide recovery. This method yielded ~50‐fold greater PA recovery than prior methods. Half of the herbarium specimens (13 of 23), including the oldest, tested positive for PAs; leaf age did not correlate with success in PA extraction. Treatment of fresh leaves with alcohol before drying did not diminish PA recovery; mercury was observed in both PA‐positive and PA‐negative specimens. CONCLUSIONS: PAs can be reliably detected in small tissue samples from herbarium specimens up to 167 years old, including specimens that had been treated with alcohol or mercury salts. The variability of PA presence among herbarium specimens of E. umbellatus indicates that multiple specimens will need to be tested before a particular species is determined to lack PAs.  aPublisher supplied data  aDEB‐1655553cNational Science Foundation  aDEB‐1655660cNational Science Foundation 3aDanainae 3aEchites 3aParsonsia 3aX-radiation 3aalcohols 3achemical ecology 3afluorescence 3aherbaria 3aleaves 3amass spectrometry 3amercuric chloride 3amercury 3aphylogeny 3asecondary metabolites 3asurveys1 aSmith, Chelsea R.1 aBurzynski, Elizabeth A.1 aSundberg, Brynn N.1 aLagalante, Anthony F.1 aLivshultz, Tatyana1 aMinbiole, Kevin P.

In this study, we tested the flooding tolerance of two-years-old seedlings of Chestnut-leaved oak (Quercus castaneifolia C.A.Mey.) to determine whether it can be recommended for use in wetland restoration programs. Seedlings of Q. castaneifolia were subjected to three treatments: (1) control (C), (2) flooding for 60 days followed by a 42-day recovery period (F + R) and (3) continuous flooding for 102 days (F). Physiological performance, plant morphological changes and biomass accumulation were assessed. Results showed that, although net photosynthetic rates, stomatal conductance and transpiration decreased with prolonged flooding, when flood waters were removed, plants were able to recover their physiological activity (49–80% compared to controls). By contrast, when plants were continually flooded, their physiological activity decreased as well as the leaves experienced precocious senescence and wilting. Biomass responses paralleled physiological responses: leaf and root biomass were 42–49% higher under F + R treatment than under continuous flooding, and all plants under the F + R survived. Therefore, Q. castaneifolia appears as a promising species to be further studied when thinking re-vegetation of riverine areas and other temporarily flooded wetlands .  aPublisher supplied data 3aQuercus 3abiomass production 3aecosystems 3aflooding tolerance 3agas exchange 3aleaves 3aphotosynthesis 3aphysiological response 3aseedlings 3asoil water 3astomatal conductance 3awetlands 3awilting 0aadventitious rooting 0abiomass accumulation 0anet photosynthetic rates 0arecovery capacity 0aChestnut-leaved oak1 aKouchaksaraei, Masoud Tabari1 aStriker, Gustavo Gabriel1 aSadati, Seyed Ehsan1 aNourmohammadi, Kazem0 tScandinavian journal of forest research.g2016 July 3, v. 31, no. 5 p.458-466dTaylor & Francisx1651-18917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02827581.2015.10722403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02708naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002300186245009300209300002000302506007600322520146100398592002801859506003701887650001101924650001301935650001101948650002401959653001601983653001301999653001302012700002502025700002002050773017602070856007902246852000902325655001202334IND60178705020221207061913.0150604e20140902xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017870502DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.14022801112doi7 aPMC41567442pmcid7 a251360862pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJordan, Jillian J.10aDevelopment of in-group favoritism in children’s third-party punishment of selfishness  ap. 12710-12715.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWhen enforcing norms for cooperative behavior, human adults sometimes exhibit in-group bias. For example, third-party observers punish selfish behaviors committed by out-group members more harshly than similar behaviors committed by in-group members. Although evidence suggests that children begin to systematically punish selfish behavior around the age of 6 y, the development of in-group bias in their punishment remains unknown. Do children start off enforcing fairness norms impartially, or is norm enforcement biased from its emergence? How does bias change over development? Here, we created novel social groups in the laboratory and gave 6- and 8-year-olds the opportunity to engage in costly third-party punishment of selfish sharing behavior. We found that by age 6, punishment was already biased: Selfish resource allocations received more punishment when they were proposed by out-group members and when they disadvantaged in-group members. We also found that although costly punishment increased between ages 6 and 8, bias in punishment partially decreased. Although 8-y-olds also punished selfish out-group members more harshly, they were equally likely to punish on behalf of disadvantaged in-group and out-group members, perhaps reflecting efforts to enforce norms impartially. Taken together, our results suggest that norm enforcement is biased from its emergence, but that this bias can be partially overcome through developmental change.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadults 3achildren 3ahumans 3aresource allocation 0acooperation 0aontogeny 0aequality1 aMcAuliffe, Katherine1 aWarneken, Felix0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2014 Sept. 2, v. 111, no. 35 p.12710-12715dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.14022801113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02293naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024003600117024003900153040001800192100002600210245004900236300001600285506007600301506003100377520097800408592002801386596001401414506003701428650002301465650002601488650001801514650002001532650001501552650003201567650002001599700002301619700002201642773011901664856008201783961000901865852000901874655001201883IND60732581720221215142551.0220901e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073258172DNAL7 a10113/73258172hdl7 a10.1016/j.jebo.2017.06.0062doi7 a10.1016/j.jebo.2017.06.0062chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDe Geest, Lawrence R.10aDeterring poaching of a common pool resource  ap. 254-276.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aWe present results from common pool resource experiments designed to examine the ability of a group of resource users, called insiders, to simultaneously manage their own exploitation and defend their resource from encroachment by outsiders. The insiders can use communication, peer monitoring and sanctions to coordinate their decisions. In addition, they can sanction any outsiders they observe. We vary the insiders’ ability to observe and sanction the outsiders from no observability to partial and full observability. We find a striking non-monotonicity between observability of the outsiders and levels of poaching. Poaching was higher under partial monitoring than zero monitoring, and was lower and more stable under full monitoring. Although full observability allowed the insiders to better coordinate their own harvests, they were unable to fully deter poaching because their sanctions were far too low and they were unwilling to punish low levels of poaching.  aPublisher supplied data  cUSDA/NIFA0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abans and sanctions 3acommunication (human) 3afisheries law 3alaw enforcement 3amonitoring 3anatural resource management 3asocial problems1 aStranlund, John K.1 aSpraggon, John M.0 tJournal of Economic Behavior & Organization.g2017 , v. 141 p.254-276dElsevier BVwJournal:11804x0167-26817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jebo.2017.06.0063Available from publisher's site  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle02703naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245012300170300001600293520131600309592002801625650001601653650001101669650001301680650001701693650002401710650001701734650001201751650001401763650001201777650001301789650001501802650001501817650001801832650001101850651001101861653001401872653001801886653002501904653001801929653001701947653002501964700002101989773011702010856008502127852000902212655001202221IND60524236720221121231907.0160705e20160703xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052423672DNAL7 a10.1080/02827581.2015.10819832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSkrøppa, Tore10aSelection in a provenance trial of Norway spruce (Picea abies L.

Full-sib families were generated by controlled crosses, producing sets of both inter- and intraprovenance families, which were planted in two short-term and in long-term trials. Measurements were made of frost damage, tree height, annual shoot growth rhythm and lammas shoots, and genetic parameters were estimated. The intraprovenance families from selected trees of East European origin showed the least variation in all traits and had the lowest heritability values. The variation among the intraprovenance families of local origin was large and with the highest estimates of heritability. The means of the provenance hybrid families were intermediate between those of the intraprovenance families. Strong genetic correlations were present between the growth rhythm traits measured, and in the family group of local origin also between these traits and frost damage, as well as for lammas shoots and height. The progenies of the selected parents of East European origin seem to be a desirable land race with less damage, lower percentage of lammas shoots and less variability in growth capacity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPicea abies 3aclones 3acrossing 3afrost injury 3agenetic correlation 3aheritability 3ahybrids 3alandraces 3aparents 3aplanting 3aplus trees 3aprovenance 3aseed orchards 3ashoots 3aSweden 0aSelection 0aheight growth 0aannual growth rhythm 0alammas shoots 0aheritability 0agenetic correlations1 aSteffenrem, Arne0 tScandinavian journal of forest research.g2016 July 3, v. 31, no. 5 p.439-449dTaylor & Francisx1651-18917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02827581.2015.10819833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04056naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094024002900120040001800149100002100167245010000188300001800288500002000306506002800326506003000354520239500384592002802779596004402807596004502851596006402896506003702960650003002997650001903027650001903046650001503065650002203080650001703102650001603119650002003135650001003155650001703165650001103182650001803193650002203211650001203233700001803245700002103263700003003284773010903314856007203423903002203495852000903517655001203526IND60576356720221207105047.0170802e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057635672DNAL7 a10.1002/ecy.19072doi7 a10.1002/ecy.19072chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShaw, Allison K.10aVector population growth and condition‐dependent movement drive the spread of plant pathogens  ap. 2145-2157.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aResource is Open Access  aWiley License Information  aPlant viruses, often spread by arthropod vectors, impact natural and agricultural ecosystems worldwide. Intuitively, the movement behavior and life history of vectors influence pathogen spread, but the relative contribution of each factor has not been examined. Recent research has highlighted the influence of host infection status on vector behavior and life history. Here, we developed a model to explore how vector traits influence the spread of vector‐borne plant viruses. We allowed vector life history (growth rate, carrying capacity) and movement behavior (departure and settlement rates) parameters to be conditional on whether the plant host is infected or healthy and whether the vector is viruliferous (carrying the virus) or not. We ran simulations under a wide range of parameter combinations and quantified the fraction of hosts infected over time. We also ran case studies of the model for Barley yellow dwarf virus, a persistently transmitted virus, and for Potato virus Y, a non‐persistently transmitted virus. We quantified the relative importance of each parameter on pathogen spread using Latin hypercube sampling with the statistical partial rank correlation coefficient technique. We found two general types of mechanisms in our model that increased the rate of pathogen spread. First, increasing factors such as vector intrinsic growth rate, carrying capacity, and departure rate from hosts (independent of whether these factors were condition‐dependent) led to more vectors moving between hosts, which increased pathogen spread. Second, changing condition‐dependent factors such as a vector's preference for settling on a host with a different infection status than itself, and vector tendency to leave a host of the same infection status, led to increased contact between hosts and vectors with different infection statuses, which also increased pathogen spread. Overall, our findings suggest that vector population growth rates had the greatest influence on rates of virus spread, but rates of vector dispersal from infected hosts and from hosts of the same infection status were also very important. Our model highlights the importance of simultaneously considering vector life history and behavior to better understand pathogen spread. Although developed for plant viruses, our model could readily be utilized with other vector‐borne pathogen systems.  aPublisher supplied data  cNSFdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000001  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000199  cUniversity of Tennesseedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000071350 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBarley yellow dwarf virus 3aPotato virus Y 3aagroecosystems 3aarthropods 3acarrying capacity 3acase studies 3acorrelation 3adisease vectors 3ahosts 3alife history 3amodels 3aplant viruses 3apopulation growth 3aviruses1 aPeace, Angela1 aPower, Alison G.1 aBosque‐Pérez, Nilsa A.0 tEcology.g2017 Aug., v. 98, no. 8 p.2145-2157dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl35737x0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecy.19073Available from publisher's site  aVersion of Record  aDNAL 7aarticle02599naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001900146245016500165300001800330520103000348592002801378650002101406650002001427650002201447650002501469650001401494650001701508650001201525650004401537650002101581650003701602653002001639653004501659653002201704653002501726653003901751700001901790700001701809700001701826700001301843700001701856700001701873773014801890856008202038852000902120655001202129IND60569811220221121032730.0170612e20170607xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056981122DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.7b015002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Xuan-Qin10aHighly Oxygenated Grayanane Diterpenoids from Flowers of Pieris japonica and Structure–Activity Relationships of Antifeedant Activity against Pieris brassicae  ap. 4456-4463.  aSix new highly oxygenated grayanane diterpenoids, neopierisoids G–L, 1–6, together with 10 known related compounds, 7–16, were identified from the flowers of the poisonous plant Pieris japonica. The structures were elucidated on the basis of comprehensive NMR spectroscopy and mass analysis. The relative configurations of 1–6 were elucidated by analysis of ROESY spectra and comparison of NMR data with the analogues. The absolute configurations of 1–6 were established by the X-ray diffraction analysis of 1 and comparison of the CD spectra of 1–6. Compared with the skeleton of the normal grayanane diterpenoids, compounds 1–6 shared an unusual seco A ring moiety. The antifeedant activities of compounds 1–16 against Pieris brassicae were evaluated by using a dual-choice bioassay, and compounds 1–10 with a normal grayanane skeleton showed potent antifeedant activity against P. brassicae. The structure–activity relationships of antifeedant activities of 1–16 against P. brassicae are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPieris brassicae 3aPieris japonica 3aX-ray diffraction 3aantifeeding activity 3abioassays 3aditerpenoids 3aflowers 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apoisonous plants 3astructure-activity relationships 0aPieris japonica 0ahighly oxygenated grayanane diterpenoids 0aneopierisoids G-L 0aantifeedant activity 0astructure−activity relationships1 aGao, Ling-Huan1 aLi, Yan-Ping1 aLi, Hong-Mei1 aLiu, Dan1 aLiao, Xia-Li1 aLi, Rong-Tao0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2017 June 07, v. 65, no. 22 p.4456-4463dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jafc.7b015003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03155naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002100186245010100207300002000308506007600328520120100404592002801605506003701633650002701670650001801697650001001715650001201725650002801737650001101765650001801776650001701794650002901811650001801840650002801858653002801886653001601914653003001930700001601960700001801976700002701994700001902021700002502040700002102065700002102086700002102107700002202128700002602150700002002176700001802196700002002214700002402234700001902258773017602277856007902453852000902532655001202541IND60178705120221207061927.0150604e20140902xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017870512DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.14024491112doi7 aPMC41567252pmcid7 a251361352pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNguyen, Tammy T.10aLoss of Miro1-directed mitochondrial movement results in a novel murine model for neuron disease  ap.

However, it is unclear whether aberrant mitochondrial motility and distribution alone are sufficient to cause neurological disease. Calcium-binding mitochondrial Rho (Miro) GTPases attach mitochondria to motor proteins for anterograde and retrograde transport in neurons. Using two new KO mouse models, we demonstrate that Miro1 is essential for development of cranial motor nuclei required for respiratory control and maintenance of upper motor neurons required for ambulation. Neuron-specific loss of Miro1 causes depletion of mitochondria from corticospinal tract axons and progressive neurological deficits mirroring human upper motor neuron disease. Although Miro1 -deficient neurons exhibit defects in retrograde axonal mitochondrial transport, mitochondrial respiratory function continues. Moreover, Miro1 is not essential for calcium-mediated inhibition of mitochondrial movement or mitochondrial calcium buffering. Our findings indicate that defects in mitochondrial motility and distribution are sufficient to cause neurological disease.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aanimal models 3aaxons 3acalcium 3aguanosinetriphosphatase 3ahumans 3alung function 3amitochondria 3amolecular motor proteins 3amotor neurons 3anervous system diseases 0aCa2+-dependent motility 0aMiro GTPase 0amitochondrial respiration1 aOh, Sang S.1 aWeaver, David1 aLewandowska, Agnieszka1 aMaxfield, Dane1 aSchuler, Max-Hinderk1 aSmith, Nathan K.1 aMacfarlane, Jane1 aSaunders, Gerald1 aPalmer, Cheryl A.1 aDebattisti, Valentina1 aKoshiba, Takumi1 aPulst, Stefan1 aFeldman, Eva L.1 aHajnóczky, György1 aShaw, Janet M.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2014 Sept. 2, v. 111, no. 35 p.E3631-E3640dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.14024491113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02621naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005900151245012200210300001600332520104700348592002801395650002201423650001501445650002901460650000901489650001701498650002001515650001301535650001701548650001301565650002401578650001701602650003601619653002101655653002101676653002901697653002701726700001901753700002301772700001901795700001801814700002401832700002401856700002201880773013101902856008502033852000902118655001202127IND60627203420190404000000.0190128e20181126xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062720342DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jproteome.8b007932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGoichon, Alexis1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6605-394410aColonic Proteome Signature in Immunoproteasome-Deficient Stressed Mice and Its Relevance for Irritable Bowel Syndrome  ap. 478-492.  aA role for immunoproteasome in the regulation of intestinal permeability has been previously suggested both in mice during water avoidance stress (WAS) and in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Here, we provide evidence that the ubiquitin–proteasome system (UPS) contributes to the pathophysiology of IBS. Indeed, we report that colonic proteome is altered in WAS mice and that β2i subunit deficiency modifies the proteome response that is associated with a limitation of colonic hyperpermeability. Interestingly, we show specific alterations of proteins involved in UPS, mitochondrial, and energy metabolism. We also report changes in the pattern of colonic ubiquitome in diarrhea-predominant IBS (IBS-D) patients and particularly a reduced expression of ubiquitinated proteins involved in the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) inflammatory signaling pathway. All these data suggest that immunoproteasome targeting may represent a new therapeutic strategy for the treatment of IBS patients with increased intestinal permeability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy metabolism 3aintestines 3airritable bowel syndrome 3amice 3amitochondria 3apathophysiology 3apatients 3apermeability 3aproteome 3asignal transduction 3atherapeutics 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 0acolonic proteome 0aimmunoproteasome 0airritable bowel syndrome 0awater avoidance stress1 aBahlouli, Wafa1 aGhouzali, Ibtissem1 aChan, Philippe1 aVaudry, David1 aDéchelotte, Pierre1 aDucrotté, Philippe1 aCoëffier, Moïse0 tJournal of proteome research.g2018 Nov. 26, v. 18, no. 1 p.478-492dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23605x1535-39077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jproteome.8b007933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02221naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024003600117024003900153040001800192100001400210245007300224300001600297506007600313506003100389520083700420592002801257596004701285506003701332650001401369650002401383650002001407650002101427650002101448650001601469650002501485700002201510700002201532700002201554773012301576856008201699961000901781852000901790655001201799IND60732581820221215142546.0220901e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073258182DNAL7 a10113/73258182hdl7 a10.1016/j.jebo.2017.08.0012doi7 a10.1016/j.jebo.2017.08.0012chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Yilan10aGenetic and environmental influences on household financial distress  ap. 404-424.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aHeterogeneity of household financial outcomes emerges from various individual and environmental factors, including personality, cognitive ability, and socioeconomic status (SES), among others. Using a genetically informative data set, we decompose the variation in financial management behavior into genetic, shared environmental and non-shared environmental factors. We find that about half of the variation in financial distress is genetically influenced, and personality and cognitive ability are associated with financial distress through genetic and within-family pathways. Moreover, genetic influences of financial distress are highest at the extremes of SES, which in part can be explained by neuroticism and cognitive ability being more important predictors of financial distress at low and high levels of SES, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculture0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acognition 3afinancial economics 3agenetic factors 3ahousehold income 3apersonal finance 3apersonality 3asocioeconomic status1 aBriley, Daniel A.1 aBrown, Jeffrey R.1 aRoberts, Brent W.0 tJournal of Economic Behavior & Organization.g2017 Oct., v. 142 p.404-424dElsevier BVwJournal:11804x0167-26817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jebo.2017.08.0013Available from publisher's site  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle03295naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005700150245009300207300001400300520181300314592002802127650002002155650001702175650001902192650001902211650001302230650001202243650001702255650001302272650001502285650001502300650001202315650001602327650001002343650001602353650001202369651001102381653001202392653001102404653001402415653001302429653001702442653003202459653001402491700002202505700002202527700002302549773009902572856008502671852000902756655001202765IND60634429520221120042647.0190328e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063442952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dendro.2019.02.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLopez, Eva L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3648-273X10aVariation in tree growth sensitivity to moisture across a water-limited forest landscape  ap. 87-96.  aWater availability acts as a major constraint on productivity in many sub-humid forest regions. Precipitation can be an important limiting factor for tree growth in such areas, but the strength of the relationship can vary by habitat and species, as well as with tree size and local hydrology. We quantified the influence of past weather conditions on the growth of two conifer species (Pinus contorta and Picea glauca) across a water-limited forest landscape in western Canada. The two species differ in moisture requirements and are segregated across a local elevational gradient, and so we expected them to exhibit different sensitivities to precipitation. We also expected that larger trees and those more distant from creeks would have a stronger response to precipitation. A hierarchical Bayesian model fit to the annual ring widths of 387 trees showed that historical precipitation from 1951 to 2016 had a positive overall effect on radial growth. The magnitude of precipitation effects on radial tree growth varied with creek proximity (a proxy for the soil moisture provided by an elevated water table in the valley bottom) and tree size. Precipitation had a greater positive influence on the growth of larger P. glauca trees, as well as individuals of both species at far and intermediate distances from creeks. Precipitation had a weaker but still positive effect on P. glauca trees growing close to creeks. Tree growth rates may change with the predicted greater inter-annual variability of precipitation under climate change, but the magnitude of these responses appear to vary by species, size, and creek proximity. Overall changes in tree growth are expected to be relatively small as trees are well-adapted to cope with the variation in water availability across a moisture-limited landscape.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aPicea glauca 3aPinus contorta 3aclimate change 3aconifers 3aforests 3agrowth rings 3ahabitats 3alandscapes 3asoil water 3astreams 3atree growth 3atrees 3awater table 3aweather 3aCanada 0aClimate 0aGrowth 0aHydrology 0aMoisture 0aPicea glauca 0aPinus contortaprecipitation 0aTree size1 aKerr, Samantha A.1 aSauchyn, David J.1 aVanderwel, Mark C.0 tDendrochronologia.g2019 Apr., v. 54 p.87-96dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl71157x1125-78657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dendro.2019.02.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01757naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002000145245008700165300001800252520053500270592002800805650001400833650001400847650001500861650002300876650002200899650001300921650001100934650001400945650002100959650001300980650001200993700001901005700006501024700006101089773013301150856007901283852000901362655001201371IND60723599320221118182225.0210115e20201231xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072359932DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.0c017462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaiti, Subhadip10aSite-Selective Aerobic C–H Monoacylation of Carbazoles Using Palladium Catalysis  ap. 1396-1407.  aThis manuscript describes the development of a remarkably general palladium-catalyzed monoacylation of carbazoles using toluene derivatives playing the dual role of acyl source and organic solvent.

The scope of the method is explored using aldehyde as the acyl source.

Methods: We analyzed two independent datasets of serum retinol levels with self-reported ethnicities and the differences of allele frequencies of the SNPs associated with vitamin A metabolism between groups in publicly available datasets. Results: Non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic pregnant women showed high VAD prevalence in both datasets. Interestingly, the VAD prevalence for Hispanic pregnant women significantly differed between datasets (p = 1.973 × 10⁻¹⁰, 95%CI 0.04–0.22). Alleles known to confer the risk of low serum retinol (rs10882272 C and rs738409 G) showed higher frequencies in the race/ethnicity groups with more VAD. Moreover, minor allele frequencies of a set of 39 previously reported SNPs associated with vitamin A metabolism were significantly different between the populations of different ancestries than those of randomly selected SNPs (p = 0.030). Conclusions: Our analysis confirmed that VAD prevalence varies between different ethnic groups/races and may be causally associated with genetic variants conferring risk for low retinol levels. Assessing genetic variant information prior to performing an effective nutrient supplementation program will help us plan more effective food-based interventions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalleles 3ablood serum 3adata collection 3ametabolism 3anationalities and ethnic groups 3arisk 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3avitamin A 3avitamin A deficiency1 aWang, Tao 1 aGarretto, Diana 1 aIsasi, Carmen R.1 aCardoso, Wellington V.1 aGreally, John M.1 aQuadro, Loredana 0 tNutrients.g2021 May 21, v. 13, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu130617433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02244naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024003500132040001800167100001500185245006900200506007600269506003100345520093100376592002801307596003401335506003701369650000901406650001001415650001301425650003201438650002001470650001001490650000901500653000901509653002301518653001001541653001201551700001501563700001901578773010901597856008201706961001301788852000901801655001201810IND60741545120221207140910.0210708e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074154512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcs.2021.1032702chorus7 a10.1016/j.jcs.2021.1032702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBean, S.R.10aZein functionality in viscoelastic dough for baked food products  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aZein is the major prolamin storage protein of maize and isolated zein is one of only two prolamins available commercially. Zein has a long history of use in the production of a wide range of materials including films, coatings, and fibers. Zein also has the unique ability to form viscoelastic dough with wheat-like properties when mixed with water under appropriate conditions. The ability to form such dough provides zein with the potential to be used in the production of baked food products for the gluten-free industry, in portions of the world where producing wheat is difficult or importing wheat is expensive, and in novel applications for plant-based foods in general. This article discusses factors that impact zein viscoelastic dough formation including the role of protein secondary structure, methods for improving zein dough formation as well as the production of breads and noodles from zein viscoelastic dough.  aPublisher supplied data  cAgricultural Research Service0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acorn 3adough 3aindustry 3aprotein secondary structure 3aviscoelasticity 3awheat 3azein 0aZein 0aViscoelastic dough 0aMaize 0aProtein1 aAkin, P.A.1 aAramouni, F.M.0 tJournal of cereal science.g2021 July, v. 100 p.103270-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46803x0733-52107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcs.2021.1032703Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02647naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245009300176300001600269520115600285592002801441650001201469650001501481650002601496650001601522650002201538650001101560650001501571650002001586650002001606650003601626650001301662650001501675650002401690653002201714653002101736653001401757653002201771653002001793653003301813700001701846700001501863700006201878773013101940856008502071852000902156655001202165IND60627203520190404000000.0190128e20181102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062720352DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jproteome.8b008122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDreier, Roland Felix10aGlobal Ion Suppression Limits the Potential of Mass Spectrometry Based Phosphoproteomics  ap. 493-507.  aMass spectrometry based proteomics has become the method of choice for pinpointing and monitoring thousands of post-translational modifications, predominately phosphorylation sites, in cellular signaling studies. Critical for achieving this analytical depth is the enrichment of phosphorylated peptides prior to liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (MS) analysis. Despite the high prevalence of this modification, the numbers of identified phosphopeptides lag behind those achieved for unmodified peptides, and the cause for this still remains controversial. Here, we use an effective phosphatase protocol that considerably improves global ionization efficiency and, therefore, the overall sensitivity and coverage of standard phosphoproteomics studies. We demonstrate the power of our method on the model system of Salmonella-infected macrophages by extending the current quantitative picture of immune signaling pathways involved in infection. In combination with sensitive, label-free targeted MS for phosphorylation site validation, our approach is ideally suited to exploring cellular phosphorylation based signaling networks in high detail.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenzymes 3aionization 3aliquid chromatography 3amacrophages 3amass spectrometry 3amodels 3amonitoring 3aphosphopeptides 3aphosphorylation 3apost-translational modification 3aproteome 3aproteomics 3asignal transduction 0aphosphoproteomics 0aimmune signaling 0ainfection 0amass spectrometry 0aion suppression 0aparallel reaction monitoring1 aAhrné, Erik1 aBroz, Petr1 aSchmidt, Alexander1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3149-23810 tJournal of proteome research.g2018 Nov. 02, v. 18, no. 1 p.493-507dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23605x1535-39077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jproteome.8b008123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02699naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005500148245013100203520141600334592002801750650001101778650001301789650002001802650001101822650002201833650002401855653004001879653001701919653002001936653001401956653003401970700002302004700002302027700006102050773012202111856008302233852000902316655001202325IND60741545220221118104251.0210820e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074154522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jevs.2021.1036812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOliva, Rene1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9400-362910aTenogenic Potential of Equine Fetal Mesenchymal Stem Cells Under The In Vitro Effect of Bone Morphogenetic Protein-12 (BMP-12)  aEquine adult bone marrow-derived MSCs (BM-MSCs) may be induced into the tenogenic lineage after exposure with bone morphogenetic protein-12 (BMP-12). Despite fetal BM-MSCs have showed a greater differentiation potential compared to adults, the tenogenic differentiation capacity of equine fetal BM-MSC have not been reported. Thus, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the in vitro tenogenic differentiation potential of equine fetal BM-MSCs under the effect of BMP-12. Equine fetal BM-MSCs were exposed to three concentrations of BMP-12 (25, 50 and 100 ng/mL) during a 21-day culture period. Levels of mRNA of tenogenic markers decorin (DCN), tenomodulin (TNMD), scleraxis (SCX), collagen 1α1 (COL1α1) and protein expression of Col1α1 were evaluated. Plastic adherent cells exhibited specific MSC profile including expression of CD73 and lack of expression of CD34. Gene expression levels of DCN, TNMD, SCX and COL1α1 were increased in equine fetal BM-MSC exposed to three different concentrations of BMP-12 during a 21-day culture period. Equine fetal BM-MSCs displayed specific expression profiles suggesting features of MSCs and multipotent capacity. Furthermore, up-regulation of tenogenic markers DCN, TNMD, COL1α1 and SCX after exposure to different concentrations of BMP-12 suggests that equine fetal BM-MSCs have potential to activate selected genes that control tenogenic differentiation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3acollagen 3agene expression 3ahorses 3aprotein synthesis 3aveterinary medicine 0aEquine fetal mesenchymal stem cells 0amultipotency 0adifferentiation 0atenogenic 0abone morphogenetic protein-121 aNúñez P., Iván,1 aSegunda, Moises N.1 aPeralta, Oscar A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2040-49020 tJournal of equine veterinary science.g2021 Sept., v. 104 p.103681-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl33309x0737-08067nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jevs.2021.1036813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03373naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245010100169300001600270520165300286592002801939650001601967650001901983650001502002650001302017650002602030650001702056650002102073650001102094650001602105650002602121650002002147650002202167650001302189650001502202650001702217650002902234650003802263653001002301653001502311653002602326653001602352653002102368700001602389700001602405700001402421700001702435700001802452700001302470700002802483700005902511773013102570856008502701852000902786655001202795IND60627203620221120081748.0190128e20181129xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062720362DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jproteome.8b008142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYuan, Baoying10aProteomic Profiling of Human Hepatic Stellate Cell Line LX2 Responses to Irradiation and TGF-β1  ap. 508-521.  aHepatic stellate cells (HSCs) are the main target of radiation damage and primarily contribute to the development of radiation-induced liver fibrosis. However, the molecular events underlying the radiation-induced activation of HSCs are not fully elucidated. In the present study, human HSC line LX2 was treated with X-ray irradiation and/or TGF-β1, and profibrogenic molecules were evaluated. The iTRAQ LC–MS/MS technology was performed to identify global protein expression profiles in LX2 following exposure to different stimuli. Irradiation or TGF-β1 alone increased expression of α-SMA, collagen 1, CTGF, PAI-1, and fibronectin. Irradiation and TGF-β1 cooperatively induced expression of these profibrotic markers. In total, 102, 137, 155 dysregulated proteins were identified in LX2 cell samples affected by irradiation, TGF-β1, or cotreatment, respectively. Bioinformatic analyses showed that the three differentially expressed protein sets were commonly associated with cell cycle and protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum. The expression of a set of proteins was properly validated: CDC20, PRC1, KIF20A, CCNB1, SHCBP, TACC3 were upregulated upon irradiation or irradiation and TGF-β1 costimulation, whereas SPARC and THBS1 were elevated by TGF-β1 or TGF-β1 plus irradiation treatment. Furthermore, CDC20 inhibition suppressed expression of profibrotic markers in irradiated and TGF-β1-stimulated LX2 cells. Detailed data on potential molecular mechanisms causing the radiation-induced HSC activation presented here would be instrumental in developing radiotherapy strategies that minimize radiation-induced liver fibrosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3abioinformatics 3acell cycle 3acollagen 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3afibronectins 3ahuman cell lines 3ahumans 3airradiation 3aliquid chromatography 3aliver cirrhosis 3aprotein synthesis 3aproteome 3aproteomics 3aradiotherapy 3atandem mass spectrometry 3atransforming growth factor beta 1 0aiTRAQ 0aproteomics 0ahepatic stellate cell 0airradiation 0ahepatic fibrosis1 aChen, Yuhan1 aWu, Zhifeng1 aZhang, Li1 aZhuang, Yuan1 aZhao, Xiaomei1 aNiu, Hao1 aCheng, Jason Chia-Hsien1 aZeng, Zhaochong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4330-36880 tJournal of proteome research.g2018 Nov. 29, v. 18, no. 1 p.508-521dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23605x1535-39077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jproteome.8b008143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02956naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006600139245009100205500002000296520136300316592002801679596006001707596006601767596010601833650001801939650002201957650001901979650002101998650001302019650000902032650001202041651001802053651001102071700002602082700002702108700002702135700002202162700002302184700003202207700007002239773011902309856007302428852000902501655001202510IND60742050420221121091303.0210622e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074205042DNAL7 a10.1111/obr.132402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVilar‐Compte, Mireya1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9047-110210aMigration as a determinant of childhood obesity in the United States and Latin America  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aInternational migration has economic and health implications. The acculturation process to the host country may be linked to childhood obesity. We use the Community Energy Balance (CEB) framework to analyze the relationship between migration and childhood obesity in Mexican households with international migrants. Using longitudinal data from the Mexican Family Life Survey (MxFLS), we examine how migrant networks affect childhood obesity in origin communities. We also review binational health programs that could be effective at tackling childhood obesity in migrant households from Mexico. Children embedded in migrant networks are at greater risk of developing overweight or obesity, suggesting a significant relationship between childhood obesity and international migration in Mexican households. Based on our search criteria, our analysis of health outreach programs shows that Ventanillas de Salud (VDS)/Health Windows has great promise to prevent childhood obesity in a culturally sensitive and trustful environment. The CEB framework is useful to understand how migration contributes to the risk of childhood overweight and obesity in migrant households. VDS is a feasible and replicable strategy with great potential to address childhood obesity among migrant families accounting for the dynamic and binational determinants of childhood obesity.  aPublisher supplied data  aNICHD‐R01HD047522cMexican Family Life Survey (MxFLS)  aNIA‐R01‐AG030668‐04cMexican Family Life Survey (MxFLS)  aU48DP006380‐02‐00cCenters for Disease Control and Prevention, Prevention Research Center Program 3aacculturation 3achildhood obesity 3aenergy balance 3afamily relations 3aoutreach 3arisk 3asurveys 3aLatin America 3aMexico1 aBustamante, Arturo V.1 aLópez‐Olmedo, Nancy1 aGaitán‐Rossi, Pablo1 aTorres, Jaqueline1 aPeterson, Karen E.1 aTeruel, Graciela M.,d1968-1 aPérez‐Escamilla, Rafael1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9416-80390 tObesity reviews.g2021 June, v. 22 Suppl S3 p.e13240-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3949851x1467-78817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/obr.132403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02684naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001200145245012300157300001800280520157300298592002801871650001201899650001201911650002801923650003001951650001101981650001301992650002202005700001902027700002202046700005702068773013302125856007902258852000902337655001202346IND60723599620221118182250.0210115e20210105xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072359962DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.0c019602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCui, Qi10aDensity Functional Theory Study of Mechanisms of [8 + 2] Cycloadditions of Dienylfurans/Dienylisobenzofurans with DMAD  ap. 1419-1429.  aThe mechanisms of [8 + 2] cycloaddition reactions between dienylfurans/dienylisobenzofurans and the activated alkyne, DMAD (dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate), have been investigated by DFT calculations. The former [8 + 2] reaction is stepwise, starting from attack of the diene substituent on furan, not the furyl moiety in dienylfurans, to DMAD to give a diradical intermediate, which then undergoes ring closure to form the second bond between DMAD and the furan moiety, generating the final [8 + 2] cycloadducts. In contrast, the latter [8 + 2] reaction starts from [4 + 2] cycloaddition of the diene in the furan ring of dienylisobenzofurans toward DMAD, followed by the rate-determining stepwise [1,5]-vinyl shift, forming the [8 + 2] products. The different mechanisms of [8 + 2] reactions are attributed to the facts that for dienylfurans, the reactive diene part is the diene substituent on furan, but in the case of dienylisobenzofurans, it is the diene in the furan ring (its reaction with DMAD to generate an aromatic benzene ring is the driving force for this regiochemistry). Consequently, the [8 + 2] reactions begin with the reaction of the most reactive part of tetraene (either the diene substituent on furan for dienylfurans or the diene in the furan ring for dienylisobenzofurans) with DMAD. FMO analysis and kinetic study have been carried out to gain more information of the reaction mechanisms. Two [8 + 2] reactions of dienylisobenzofurans with different substituents toward DMAD have also been further analyzed by DFT calculations in this paper.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkynes 3abenzene 3acycloaddition reactions 3adensity functional theory 3afurans 3amoieties 3aorganic chemistry1 aChen, Yuanyuan1 aHerndon, James W.1 aYu, Zhi-Xiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0939-97270 tJournal of organic chemistry.g2021 Jan. 05, v. 86, no. 2 p.1419-1429dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19181x1520-69047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.joc.0c019603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03255naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024003600117024003900153040001800192100001800210245015500228300001600383506007600399506003100475506002800506506003600534520158400570592002802154596000902182506003702191650002102228650001602249650001102265650002402276650001802300650001402318650001502332650002202347650001302369650001802382650001002400650001102410650001802421650002202439700001602461700001702477700001602494773011502510856008202625961000902707852000902716655001202725IND60732582220221215142542.0220901e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073258222DNAL7 a10113/73258222hdl7 a10.1016/j.jece.2016.12.0362doi7 a10.1016/j.jece.2016.12.0362chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Weilan10aElucidating the mechanisms for plant uptake and in-planta speciation of cerium in radish (Raphanus sativus L.) treated with cerium oxide nanoparticles  ap. 572-577.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aResource is Open Access  aElsevier BV License Information  aEven though the plant uptake of cerium oxide nanoparticles (CeO(2) NPs) has been reported, the mechanisms remain unknown. This study aimed to provide new insights into CeO(2) NPs plant uptake through two objectives: (1) to investigate whether CeO(2) NPs dissolute before their plant uptake and (2) to determine the in-planta speciation of Ce. Bench scale experiments were conducted by growing radish in solutions containing 10 mg elemental Ce/L of bulk CeO(2) particles, CeO(2) NPs or ionic Ce. Transmission electron microscope and inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) analysis suggested that one pathway for CeO(2) NPs uptake was through direct uptake of intact CeO(2) NPs. More importantly, our results confirmed that part of the particulate CeO(2) was transformed into ionic Ce on the root surface before they were taken up by plants. Ionic Ce uptake and transport was a primary mechanism for Ce accumulation in plant shoots. This study further demonstrated that enhanced CeO(2) dissolution on root surface was due to the organic acids with lower molecular weight (e.g. succinic acid) in radish root exudates. Large particles composed of high contents of P and Ce were detected in radish roots treated only with ionic Ce, suggesting the formation of CePO(4) particles. In summary, the results indicated that CeO(2) NPs was taken up by radish as both intact nanoparticles and dissolved ions. Inside plant tissues, Ce is present as a cocktail of CeO(2) NPs, dissolved Ce and Ce salt (e.g. CePO(4)) and the specific combination of Ce species is tissue dependent.  aPublisher supplied data  cUSDA0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aRaphanus sativus 3aceric oxide 3acerium 3achemical speciation 3aion transport 3ananoceria 3aphosphorus 3aphytoaccumulation 3aradishes 3aroot exudates 3aroots 3ashoots 3asuccinic acid 3auptake mechanisms1 aDan, Yongbo1 aShi, Honglan1 aMa, Xingmao0 tJournal of Environmental Chemical Engineering.g2017 Feb., v. 5, no. 1 p.572-577dElsevier BVx2213-29297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jece.2016.12.0363Available from publisher's site  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle03094naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245014000172300001800312520143400330592002801764650002501792650002001817650002301837650002401860650001801884650001401902650001401916650001201930650003601942650001301978650001301991650001502004650002402019650001202043650002002055650001202075653002502087653002102112653001502133653001002148653002402158653001202182653002402194653001302218653001302231653002802244700002102272700001802293773013302311856008702444852000902531655001202540IND60569811620221121042741.0170612e20160603xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056981162DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jproteome.5b006152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMasood, Muhammad10aTwo Oyster Species That Show Differential Susceptibility to Virus Infection Also Show Differential Proteomic Responses to Generic dsRNA  ap. 1735-1746.  aViral diseases are a significant cause of mortality and morbidity in oysters, resulting in significant economic losses. We investigated the proteomic responses of these two species of oysters to generic double-stranded RNAs (poly I:C and poly A:U). Analysis of proteomic data using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitaion (iTRAQ) indicated that there were significant differences in the proteomic responses of the two oyster species resulting from this treatment. Gene ontology analysis showed that several biological processes, cellular components, and molecular function were unique to the different data sets. For example, a number of proteins implicated in the TLR signaling pathway were associated with the Saccostrea glomerata data set but were absent in the Crassostra gigas data set. These results suggest that the differences in the proteomic responses to dsRNA may underpin the biological differences in viral susceptibility. Molecular targets previously shown to be expressed in C. gigas in response to OsHV1 infections were not present in our proteomic data sets, although they were present in the RNA extracted from the very same tissues. Taken together, our data indicate that there are substantial disparities between transcriptomic and proteomic responses to dsRNA challenge, and a comprehensive account of the oysters’ biological responses to these treatments must take into account that disparity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSaccostrea glomerata 3adata collection 3adisease resistance 3adouble-stranded RNA 3agene ontology 3amorbidity 3amortality 3aoysters 3apolyinosinic-polycytidylic acid 3aproteins 3aproteome 3aproteomics 3asignal transduction 3atissues 3atranscriptomics 3aviruses 0aSaccostrea glomerata 0aCrassostra gigas 0aproteomics 0aiTRAQ 0adouble-stranded RNA 0aoysters 0aantiviral responses 0apoly I:C 0apoly A:U 0arhodamine-labeled dsRNA1 aRaftos, David A.1 aNair, Sham V.0 tJournal of Proteome Research.g2016 June 03, v. 15, no. 6 p.1735-1746dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23605x1535-39077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jproteome.5b006153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03070naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245013800162520169400300592002801994650001802022650001402040650002302054650003002077650000902107650001102116650002202127650000902149650000702158650001602165650001902181650000902200700002202209700002102231700002702252700002202279700002502301700002002326700002302346700001702369700002102386773012202407856007402529852000902603655001202612IND60742677020221122045820.0210624e20210615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074267702DNAL7 a10.3390/nu130620412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBosman, Gerlof P.10aLimited Lactosylation of Beta-Lactoglobulin from Cow’s Milk Exerts Strong Influence on Antigenicity and Degranulation of Mast Cells  aBackground: beta-lactoglobulin (BLG) is one of the major cow’s milk proteins and the most abundant allergen in whey. Heating is a common technologic treatment applied during milk transformational processes. Maillardation of BLG in the presence of reducing sugars and elevated temperatures may influence its antigenicity and allergenicity. Primary objective: to analyze and identify lactosylation sites by capillary electrophoresis mass spectrometry (CE-MS). Secondary objective: to assess the effect of lactosylated BLG on antigenicity and degranulation of mast cells. Methods: BLG was lactosylated at pH 7, a water activity (aw) of 0.43, and a temperature of 65 °C using a molar ratio BLG:lactose of 1:1 by incubating for 0, 3, 8, 16 or 24 h. For the determination of the effect on antibody-binding capacity of lactosylated BLG, an ELISA was performed. For the assessment of degranulation of the cell-line RBL-hεIa-2B12 transfected with the human α-chain, Fcε receptor type 1 (FcεRI) was used. Results: BLG showed saturated lactosylation between 8 and 16 incubation hours in our experimental setup. Initial stage lactosylation sites L1 (N-terminus)—K47, K60, K75, K77, K91, K138 and K141—have been identified using CE-MS. Lactosylated BLG showed a significant reduction of both the IgG binding (p = 0.0001) as well as degranulation of anti-BLG IgE-sensitized RBL-hεIa-2B12 cells (p < 0.0001). Conclusions and clinical relevance: this study shows that lactosylation of BLG decreases both the antigenicity and degranulation of mast cells and can therefore be a promising approach for reducing allergenicity of cow’s milk allergens provided that the process is well-controlled.  aPublisher supplied data 3aallergenicity 3aallergens 3abeta-lactoglobulin 3acapillary electrophoresis 3acows 3ahumans 3amass spectrometry 3amilk 3apH 3atemperature 3awater activity 3awhey1 aOliveira, Sergio 1 aSimons, Peter J.1 aSastre Torano, Javier 1 aSomsen, Govert W.1 aKnippels, Leon M.

Their planar structures were elucidated based on NMR and MS spectrometric analysis, and the absolute configurations were determined by the Marfey’s method. Structurally, 1 is a unique peptide with a backbone bearing a pyrrolidine-2,5-dione unit, which is the first occurrence moiety specifically in a naturally occurring cyclohexapeptide. The total synthesis of 1 and 2 was achieved by solution-phase in parallel with solid-phase peptide synthesis, and their absolute configurations were further confirmed. The combination of 2 with gefitinib exhibited synergistic antiproliferative activity in acquired gefitinib-resistant non-small cell lung cancer cells (HCC827-gef). The underlying mechanism for the antiproliferative activity of 2 was in part associated with the suppression of YAP expression in HCC827-gef cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZanthoxylum nitidum 3alung neoplasms 3amoieties 3aorganic chemistry 3apeptides1 aWang, Cai Yi1 aKim, Donghwa1 aWang, Heng-Shan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6474-83231 aZhu, Yan-Kui1 aLee, Sang Kook1 aYao, Gui-Yang1 aLiang, Dong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9765-75480 tJournal of organic chemistry.g2021 Jan. 07, v. 86, no. 2 p.1462-1470dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19181x1520-69047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.joc.0c020573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03192naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001700145245008200162300001600244520156800260592002801828650001801856650001701874650002601891650002601917650002901943650002401972650002301996650001902019650001402038650001402052650003502066650003202101650001302133650001102146650001902157650004402176650001002220650001302230650001202243650002302255650003002278650001802308650002002326650001102346700002102357700001802378700002102396773014202417852000902559856008202568655001202650IND4414613120221120052348.0200303e200811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441461312DNAL7 a10.1007/s00253-008-1717-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeiss, Agnes10aDiversity of the resident microbiota in a thermophilic municipal biogas plant  ap. 163-173.  aBiogas plants continuously convert biological wastes mainly into a mixture of methane, CO₂ and H₂O—a conversion that is carried out by a consortium of bacteria and archaea. Especially in the municipal plants dedicated towards waste treatment, the reactor feed may vary considerably, exposing the resident microbiota to a changing variety of substrates. To evaluate how and if such changes influence the microbiology, an established biogas plant (6,600 m³, up to 600 m³ biogas per h) was followed over the course of more than 2 years via polymerase chain reaction–denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of 16S rRNA genes and subsequent sequencing. Both the bacterial and the archaeal community remained stable over the investigation. Of the bacterial consortium, about half of the sequences were in decreasing order of occurrence: Thermoacetogenium sp., Anaerobaculum mobile, Clostridium ultunense, Petrotoga sp., Lactobacillus hammesii, Butyrivibrio sp., Syntrophococcus sucromutans, Olsenella sp., Tepidanaerobacter sp., Sporanaerobacter acetigenes, Pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, Lactobacillus fuchuensis or Lactobacillus sakei, Lactobacillus parabrevis or Lactobacillus spicheri and Enterococcus faecalis. The other half matched closely to ones from similar habitats (thermophilic anaerobic methanogenic digestion). The archaea consisted of Methanobrevibacter sp., Methanoculleus bourgensis, Methanosphaera stadtmanae, Methanimicrococcus blatticola and uncultured Methanomicrobiales. The role of these species in methane production is discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnaerobaculum 3aButyrivibrio 3aClostridium ultunense 3aEnterococcus faecalis 3aLactobacillus fuchuensis 3aLactobacillus sakei 3aMethanobrevibacter 3aMethanoculleus 3aOlsenella 3aPetrotoga 3aPseudoramibacter alactolyticus 3aSyntrophococcus sucromutans 3abacteria 3abiogas 3acarbon dioxide 3adenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis 3agenes 3ahabitats 3amethane 3amethane production 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aribosomal RNA 3awaste treatment 3awastes1 aJerome, Valerie,1 aFreitag, Ruth1 aMayer, Helmut K.0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2008 Nov., v. 81, no. 1 p.163-173dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl35319x0175-75987nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-008-1717-63Available from publisher's site 7aarticle01994naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001600112245008000128300001400208500001400222520081400236592002801050650002301078650001401101650001801115650002201133650002001155650001001175650001801185650001001203650001301213650001901226650001501245650001301260650000901273650001001282650001601292653002601308653001801334700001901352700001501371773016501386852000901551655001201560IND60710376720221117162318.0200908e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071037672DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDhore, R.N.10aPerformance of goats on wheat and sorghum straw-based complete feed pellets  ap. 41-44.  aNAL-light  aThirty-six male goats were randomly distributed into 3 equal groups and fed on complete feed pellets of concentrate (40 parts) and roughage (60 parts).

It was concluded that sorghum straw could be used as a sole roughage source in complete pellet feed for intensive goat production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaverage daily gain 3acellulose 3acrude protein 3adry matter intake 3afeed conversion 3agoats 3ahemicellulose 3amales 3anitrogen 3apelleted feeds 3aphosphorus 3aroughage 3asole 3awheat 3awheat straw 0aComplete feed pellets 0aSorghum straw1 aDeshmukh, G.B.1 aDhok, A.P.0 tIndian journal of small ruminants.g2014 Apr., v. 20, no. 1 p.41-44dIndian Society for Sheep and Goat Production and UtilizationwJournal:2092x0973-97187nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02807naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002000142245014200162500001400304520129000318592002801608650001601636650002401652650001101676650001501687650001601702650002601718650001001744650001101754650002601765650001801791650001401809650001401823650001301837650002301850650001001873650001101883650001401894650001401908650001201922650003101934650001501965650001101980650001501991700002302006700002602029700001802055773011902073856007602192852000902268655001202277IND60718869920221121055557.0201126e20201023xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071886992DNAL7 a10.3390/foods91115272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLille, Martina 10aStructural and Textural Characteristics of 3D-Printed Protein- and Dietary Fibre-Rich Snacks Made of Milk Powder and Wholegrain Rye Flour  aNAL-light  aThis study addressed the potential of 3D printing as a processing technology for delivering personalized healthy eating solutions to consumers. Extrusion-based 3D printing was studied as a tool to produce protein- and dietary fibre-rich snack products from whole milk powder and wholegrain rye flour. Aqueous pastes were prepared from the raw materials at various ratios, grid-like samples printed from the pastes at ambient temperature and the printed samples post-processed by oven baking at 150 °C. Printing pastes were characterized by rheological measurements and the baked samples by X-ray micro tomography, texture measurements and sensory analysis. All formulations showed good printability and shape stability after printing. During baking, the milk powder-based samples expanded to a level that caused a total collapse of the printed multiple-layer samples. Shape retention during baking was greatly improved by adding rye flour to the milk formulation. Sensory evaluation revealed that the volume, glossiness, sweetness and saltiness of the baked samples increased with an increasing level of milk powder in the printing paste. A mixture of milk powder and rye flour shows great potential as a formulation for healthy snack products produced by extrusion-based 3D printing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aambient temperature 3abaking 3adried milk 3aexhibitions 3ahealthy eating habits 3aovens 3apastes 3aprocessing technology 3araw materials 3arye flour 3asaltiness 3asampling 3asensory evaluation 3ashape 3asnacks 3asolutions 3asweetness 3atexture 3athree-dimensional printing 3atomography 3avolume 3awhole milk1 aKortekangas, Anni 1 aHeiniö, Raija-Liisa 1 aSozer, Nesli 0 tFoods.g2020 Oct. 23, v. 9, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods91115273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03160naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006000151245009600211300001600307520206500323592002802388650002602416650001102442650001202453650001402465650001302479650001502492650001602507650002102523650001502544651001102559651001102570651001702581773010502598856008602703852000902789655001202798IND60622639420221120194742.0190318e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062263942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2018.11.0442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWine, Michael L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3936-339710aUnder non-stationarity securitization contributes to uncertainty and Tragedy of the Commons  ap. 716-721.  aUncertainty is a defining characteristic of hydrologic investigations, with increasing recognition of parameter, structural, measurement, and prediction uncertainty. Here we suggest that an additional form of uncertainty—(geo)political uncertainty—is locally important, but commonly neglected. We define geopolitical uncertainty in hydrology as indefiniteness of water balance processes, the relative magnitude of hydrologic fluxes, or causality as a consequence of complex international relations amongst riparians of a transboundary basin forced by internal economic, political, and nationalistic drivers (as well as interactions amongst these drivers) under a regime of non-stationary climate. We suggest that such (geo)political uncertainty has developed in the Jordan River basin as a consequence of intentionally ambiguous language in the Israel Jordan Peace Treaty, outstanding discussions regarding water allocations to the Palestinian Authority, and lobbying by the powerful agricultural sector. In the presence of economic motives requiring consumption of water these drivers promote securitization manifested as secrecy regarding water management and consumption by the upstream riparian, which given non-stationary climate opens a void of (geo)political uncertainty in which the relative importance of climate variability and change becomes indeterminate relative to changing water consumption, thereby perhaps allowing the upstream riparian to increase water consumption. The consequence of this (geo)political uncertainty for hydrologic studies is large water balance uncertainty, inability to reproduce water consumption studies due to data secrecy, and disagreement regarding the relative importance of pertinent drivers (i.e., climate versus consumption). Greater acknowledgement and awareness of (geo)political uncertainty’s impacts on hydrologic studies is needed, as are concerted efforts to reduce this uncertainty for the benefit of transparent water dialogue among riparians and knowledge-based management of common-pool resources.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural industry 3abasins 3aclimate 3ahydrology 3apolitics 3aprediction 3auncertainty 3awater management 3awatersheds 3aIsrael 3aJordan 3aJordan River0 tJournal of hydrology.g2019 Jan., v. 568 p.716-721dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2018.11.0443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02566naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001700146245013400163300001800297520136300315592002801678650000801706650002101714650002101735650002101756650001601777650001501793650002301808650002201831650001701853700001901870700001701889700002201906700002001928700001901948773012201967856008202089852000902171655001202180IND60562259820221119024920.0170204e20160922xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056225982DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcb.6b048112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKalel, Rahul10aInteraction of a Julolidine-Based Neutral Ultrafast Molecular Rotor with Natural DNA: Spectroscopic and Molecular Docking Studies  ap. 9843-9853.  aUltrafast molecular rotors (UMRs) are reported to be one of the best fluorescent sensors to study different microenvironments, including biomolecules. In the present work, we have explored the possibility of application of a julolidine-based neutral UMR, 9-(2,2-dicyano vinyl) julolidine (DCVJ), as a DNA sensor and studied its mode of binding with DNA in detail using spectroscopic and molecular docking techniques. Our spectroscopic studies indicate that association of DCVJ with DNA leads to a very large enhancement in its emission intensity. Detailed investigation reveals that, despite being a neutral molecule, binding of DCVJ with DNA is largely modulated in the presence of salt. Such an unusual salt effect has been explained by invoking the ion–dipole interaction between DCVJ and the phosphate backbone of DNA. The ion–dipole interaction has also been established by studying the interaction of DCVJ with nucleosides. Detailed time-resolved studies show that the twisting motion around the vinyl bond in DCVJ gets retarded to a great extent because of its association with DNA molecules. Through competitive binding studies, it has also been established that DCVJ also binds to DNA through intercalation. Finally, quantum chemical calculations and molecular docking studies have been performed to confirm the mode of binding of DCVJ with DNA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aemissions factor 3amolecular models 3amolecular rotors 3anucleosides 3aphosphates 3aphysical chemistry 3aspectral analysis 3aspectroscopy1 aMora, Aruna

Absolute atmospheric corrections are carried out using physical based models, generally known as radiative transfer (RT) codes such as MODerate resolution atmospheric TRANsmission (MODTRAN), Second Simulation of the Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum (6S) etc. Most of the available atmospheric correction schemes are commercially off-the-shelf and use patented RT codes. The objective of the present work is to develop an open-end atmospheric correction scheme, named as Flexible Atmospheric Compensation Technique (FACT), based on open source 6S RT code. The proposed FACT scheme utilizes look-up architecture for simulating the outputs of 6S RT code for various input parameters’ combination. Input parameters such as initial visibility, columnar water vapour are estimated using the dark object and the Continuum Interpolated Band Ratio (CIBR) methods respectively. The proposed FACT scheme has been evaluated exhaustively using spatio-spectral statistical error measures such as Spatial-Root Mean Square Error (S-RMSE), Spatial-Mean Absolute Error (S-MAE) and spectral-RMSE by comparing the performance with widely used Fast Line-of-sight Atmospheric Analysis of Hypercubes (FLAASH) and the customized NASA JPL’s atmospheric correction scheme. Datasets from hyperspectral (AVIRIS-NG and Hyperion) and multispectral (LANDSAT-8 OLI and WorldView-3) remote sensors were chosen for comparative analysis of the developed atmospheric correction scheme against other atmospheric correction schemes. Results confirm that the proposed FACT scheme offers accuracy of about 95% for hyperspectral imaging sensors and close to 98% for multispectral imaging sensors when compared with FLAASH. Despite marginal disagreements for certain land cover features at the water vapour absorbing spectral regions, we find the proposed FACT scheme a plausible option for carrying out absolute atmospheric correction of various operational remote imaging sensors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3adata collection 3aland cover 3aradiative transfer 3awater vapor 0aAtmospheric correction 0aFACT 0aFLAASH 0aRadiative transfer code 0a6S1 aManohar Kumar, C.

Cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) has become an indispensable tool for a comprehensive in vivo assessment of cardiac anatomy and function. This protocol shows detailed measurements of mouse heart left ventricular function, myocardial strain, and hemodynamic forces using 7-Tesla CMR. First, animal preparation and positioning in the scanner are demonstrated. Survey scans are performed for planning imaging slices in various short- and long-axis views. A series of prospective ECG-triggered short-axis (SA) movies (or CINE images) are acquired covering the heart from apex to base, capturing end-systolic and end-diastolic phases. Subsequently, single-slice, retrospectively gated CINE images are acquired in a midventricular SA view, and in 2-, 3-, and 4-chamber views, to be reconstructed into high-temporal resolution CINE images using custom-built and open-source software. CINE images are subsequently analyzed using dedicated CMR image analysis software. Delineating endomyocardial and epicardial borders in SA end-systolic and end-diastolic CINE images allows for the calculation of end-systolic and end-diastolic volumes, ejection fraction, and cardiac output. The midventricular SA CINE images are delineated for all cardiac time frames to extract a detailed volume-time curve. Its time derivative allows for the calculation of the diastolic function as the ratio of the early filling and atrial contraction waves. Finally, left ventricular endocardial walls in the 2-, 3-, and 4-chamber views are delineated using feature-tracking, from which longitudinal myocardial strain parameters and left ventricular hemodynamic forces are calculated. In conclusion, this protocol provides detailed in vivo quantification of the mouse cardiac parameters, which can be used to study temporal alterations in cardiac function in various mouse models of heart disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3acardiac output 3acomputer software 3aheart 3aimage analysis 3amagnetism 3amice 3ascanners 3asurveys1 aStrijkers, Gustav J.1 aCalcagno, Claudia1 aGaripov, Ruslan R.1 aWüst, Rob C.

Transgenic lines harbouring the marker fused to a gene element, such as a promoter, may be mutagenized to isolate loss‐of‐function mutants able to survive under selection. Such a strategy allows the molecular dissection of factors that are essential for expression of the gene. Expression of individual chloroplast genes in plants and algae typically requires one or more nuclear‐encoded factors that act at the post‐transcriptional level, often through interaction with the 5′ UTR of the mRNA. To study such nuclear control further, we have developed the Escherichia coli cytosine deaminase gene codA as a conditional negative selectable marker for use in the model green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. We show that a codon‐optimized variant of codA with three amino acid substitutions confers sensitivity to 5‐fluorocytosine (5‐FC) when expressed in the chloroplast under the control of endogenous promoter/5′ UTR elements from the photosynthetic genes psaA or petA. UV mutagenesis of the psaA transgenic line allowed recovery of 5‐FC‐resistant, photosynthetically deficient lines harbouring mutations in the nuclear gene for the factor TAA1 that is required for psaA translation. Similarly, the petA line was used to isolate mutants of the petA mRNA stability factor MCA1 and the translation factor TCA1. The codA marker may be used to identify critical residues in known nuclear factors and to aid the discovery of additional factors required for expression of chloroplast genes.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aChlamydomonas reinhardtii 3aEscherichia coli 3aamino acid substitution 3achloroplasts 3acytosine deaminase 3agene expression 3agenes 3agenetically modified organisms 3amessenger RNA 3amicroalgae 3amutagenesis 3amutants 3atranscription factors 3atranslation (genetics)1 aPurton, Saul0 tplant journal.g2014 Dec., v. 80, no. 5 p.915-925dBlackwell Scientific Publishers and BIOS Scientific Publishers in association with the Society for Experimental Biologyx0960-74127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/tpj.126753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01054naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001600112245012300128300001600251520014500267592002800412650001500440650001600455651001000471653001700481653001700498653001500515653002600530653001600556653001000572700001800582773013100600852000900731655001200740IND60477771820221120135711.0160311e200107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047777182DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Wei-Nan14aThe obtusus species group of the genus Amblyseius (Acari: Phytoseiidae), with descriptions of two new species in China  ap. 101-108.  aA key to 16 species belonging to the obtusus species group of the genus Amblyseius is provided and two new species are described from China.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmblyseius 3anew species 3aChina 0aPhytoseiidae 0aAmblyseiinae 0aAmblyseius 0aobtusus species group 0anew species 0aChina1 aOu, Jian-Feng0 tSystematic and applied acarology.g2001 July, v. 6, no. 1 p.101-108dSystematic and Applied Acarology Societyx1362-19717nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03373naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245011500171520175800286592002802044650001202072650002802084650001102112650001402123650001402137650001502151650001902166650000902185650002402194650001502218650001402233650001502247650002502262650001302287650001702300650001302317653002002330653002502350653003102375653002202406653001702428653001102445700001902456700001402475700006902489700002002558700002502578700002002603773011602623856008302739852000902822655001202831IND60744033720221119172205.0211030e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074403372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rsma.2021.1019142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGodwyn-Paulson, P.10aEvolution of southern Mexican Pacific coastline: Responses to meteo-oceanographic and physiographic conditions  aThe coast of Oaxaca, along the southern Mexican Pacific coastline, is home to diverse ecosystems, which undergoes significant erosion and accretion due to natural and anthropogenic influences. This study aims in analysing the historical shoreline variations and predicting the future changes for better coastal management plans. In order to study the long-term variations in shoreline, Landsat time-series satellite imageries between 1973 and 2020 were evaluated. Overall, the results indicate that the coast is highly dominated by accretion (74%) process, with the most significant changes occurring at the estuarine areas and beaches. Linear Regression Rate (LRR) and Weighted Linear Regression (WLR) methods showed mean variations at rates of 1.2±2.5 and 0.4±2.5 m/yr for the long-term period. The analysis of seven short-term periods (for every 5 years between 1986–2020) identified the maximum mean erosion of −20.6 m during 2005–2010 and accretion of 18.7 m during 2000–2005. However, the forecasted rate of change for the period 2030 and 2040 using End Point Rate (EPR) statistics revealed that the northern region would continue to move seaward at a rate of +0.26 m/yr and the coastline of southern region would move landward at a possible rate of −0.45 m/yr. The natural factors such as rainfall, river discharge, hurricane, and wave dynamics are the main drivers of shoreline changes along the estuarine and wetland areas. Contrarily, the anthropogenic factors such as breakwaters and urbanization are responsible for coastline dynamics along the beaches and ports. Henceforth, the estuarine region, lagoon openings, and tourist beaches require utmost attention as the sediment flow in these regions are not monitored constantly.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3acoastal zone management 3acoasts 3aestuaries 3aevolution 3ahurricanes 3amarine science 3arain 3aregression analysis 3ariver flow 3asediments 3ashorelines 3atime series analysis 3atourists 3aurbanization 3awetlands 0aLandsat imagery 0aShort/long-term rate 0aMeteo-oceanographic impact 0aFuture prediction 0aOaxaca coast 0aMexico1 aJonathan, M.P.1 aRoy, P.D.1 aRodríguez-Espinosa, P.F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0443-57281 aMuthusankar, G.1 aMuñoz-Sevilla, N.P.1 aLakshumanan, C.0 tRegional studies in marine science.g2021 Sept., v. 47 p.101914-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23214x2352-48557nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rsma.2021.1019143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02948naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245012300155300001600278520146000294592002801754650001301782650001501795650001501810650001101825650002301836650001601859650001701875650000901892650001701901650001701918650001401935650001001949650001101959650001201970650001301982650002101995650003802016650001602054700003302070700001902103700002002122700001802142700002002160773019202180856007302372852000902445655001202454IND60133266420221118220952.0150518e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013326642DNAL7 a10.1111/tpj.126862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeiz, Leila12aA protein with an inactive pterin‐4a‐carbinolamine dehydratase domain is required for Rubisco biogenesis in plants  ap. 862-869.  aRibulose‐1,5‐bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) plays a critical role in sustaining life by catalysis of carbon fixation in the Calvin–Benson pathway. Incomplete knowledge of the assembly pathway of chloroplast Rubisco has hampered efforts to fully delineate the enzyme's properties, or seek improved catalytic characteristics via directed evolution. Here we report that a Mu transposon insertion in the Zea mays (maize) gene encoding a chloroplast dimerization co‐factor of hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 (DCoH)/pterin‐4α‐carbinolamine dehydratases (PCD)‐like protein is the causative mutation in a seedling‐lethal, Rubisco‐deficient mutant named Rubisco accumulation factor 2 (raf2‐1). In raf2 mutants newly synthesized Rubisco large subunit accumulates in a high‐molecular weight complex, the formation of which requires a specific chaperonin 60‐kDa isoform. Analogous observations had been made previously with maize mutants lacking the Rubisco biogenesis proteins RAF1 and BSD2. Chemical cross‐linking of maize leaves followed by immunoprecipitation with antibodies to RAF2, RAF1 or BSD2 demonstrated co‐immunoprecipitation of each with Rubisco small subunit, and to a lesser extent, co‐immunoprecipitation with Rubisco large subunit. We propose that RAF2, RAF1 and BSD2 form transient complexes with the Rubisco small subunit, which in turn assembles with the large subunit as it is released from chaperonins.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZea mays 3aantibodies 3abiogenesis 3acarbon 3acatalytic activity 3achaperonins 3achloroplasts 3acorn 3acrosslinking 3adimerization 3aevolution 3agenes 3aleaves 3amutants 3amutation 3aprecipitin tests 3aribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase 3atransposons1 aWilliams‐Carrier, Rosalind1 aBelcher, Susan1 aMontano, Monica1 aBarkan, Alice1 aStern, David B.0 tplant journal.g2014 Dec., v. 80, no. 5 p.862-869dBlackwell Scientific Publishers and BIOS Scientific Publishers in association with the Society for Experimental Biologyx0960-74127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/tpj.126863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03568naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100006700142245015700209520206700366592002802433596004502461650001302506650001002519650001002529650001202539650001702551650002302568650002002591650001202611650001202623650000902635650001402644650001402658650001502672650001902687650001402706650001202720650001102732650001202743650001102755650001802766650000902784700003002793700002402823700002002847773010902867856007702976852000903053655001203062IND60795227720221120043725.0221003e20220922xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079522772DNAL7 a10.1155/2022/99135782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlemayehu Tassew, Addis1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6992-861414aThe Coffee Processing Method Had a More Pronounced Effect than Location and Production Systems on the Overall Quality of Kaffa Biosphere Reserve Coffees  aA comprehensive examination of the physical and cup quality of Kafa Biosphere Reserve coffees was essential to identify the inherent qualities of the coffees in connection with the area’s soil physical and chemical characteristics. As a result, preliminary coffee quality data was acquired from bean physical and cup quality examination of coffees derived through a three-stage nested design combining districts (Gimbo, Gawata, and Decha), coffee production systems (forest, semiforest, and garden), and coffee processing methods (wet, semiwet, and dry). Representative soil samples were collected according to the sampling structure and analyzed following the standard procedures. Multiple factor analysis and Pearson’s correlation coefficient analysis were applied to the collected data. According to the results of multiple factor analysis, the Gimbo and Decha districts are not significantly different from each other in terms of coffee quality. However, they are substantially different from the Gawata district in terms of coffee quality. Similarly, within each district, there are no clear differences in coffee production systems. However, the production systems of districts varied significantly. The coffee processing method had a pronounced effect on the overall quality and preliminary grade, physical and raw quality variables of coffee. Screen retention (14) was correlated with soil iron, but it was related negatively to boron and sodium contents. A significant and positive relationship was observed between green coffee bean moisture content and soil potassium, calcium, magnesium, boron, sodium, organic carbon, silicon content, and soil pH. A positive and significant relationship between soil molybdenum and the coffee quality variable was observed across the studied districts whereas most soil micronutrients, specifically, zinc, sulfur, and manganese, were significantly and negatively related to the organoleptic qualities of the coffees. Further investigation that includes the effects of elevation is recommended in future studies.  aPublisher supplied data  cSouthern Agricultural Research Institute 3aagronomy 3abeans 3aboron 3acalcium 3acoffee beans 3aconservation areas 3afactor analysis 3aforests 3agardens 3airon 3amagnesium 3amanganese 3amolybdenum 3aorganic carbon 3apotassium 3asilicon 3asodium 3asoil pH 3asulfur 3awater content 3azinc1 aBerecha Yadessa, Gezahegn1 aDebela Bote, Adugna1 aObso, Taye Kufa0 tInternational journal of agronomy.g2022 Sept. 22, v. 2022dHindawiwJournal:J000000090x1687-81677nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2022/99135783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02600naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245012900165300001600294520109000310592002801400650001901428650001901447650001601466650001201482650001901494650001001513650001101523650001801534650001301552650001401565650002201579650001701601650001201618650002601630653001001656653004401666653001601710653001401726653001301740653001401753700001501767700001801782700001201800700001801812700001201830700001601842773012101858856008201979852000902061655001202070IND60556368820221122030453.0161102e20161021xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055636882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2016.09.0992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yazhou10aOverexpression of SOX18 correlates with accelerated cell growth and poor prognosis in human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma  ap. 510-516.  aTranscription factor SOX18 has been proved to play a significant role in carcinogenesis. However, no investigation was performed about the expression of SOX18 in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). In our work, we found that the PDAC tissues had higher level of SOX18 mRNA and protein expression than matched non-tumor pancreatic tissues and high level of SOX18 protein indicated poor prognosis for PDAC patients. After knockdown of SOX18 gene in PANC-1 and SW1990 cell lines, which showed higher expression level of SOX18 among five PDAC cell lines, the abilities of proliferation, migration and invasion were inhibited and the tumor growth was suppressed in vivo. In addition, the flow cytometry results indicated that down-regulation of SOX18 induced G1/S phase arrest. Furthermore, we found that the expression of cyclin D1, c-myc and MMP-7, three tumorigenesis promoters, was inhabited with downregulation of SOX18. In conclusion, our study reveals that SOX18 plays a significant role in promoting the growth of PDAC, and might serve as a promising target for PDAC therapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadenocarcinoma 3acarcinogenesis 3acell growth 3acyclins 3aflow cytometry 3agenes 3ahumans 3amessenger RNA 3apatients 3aprognosis 3aprotein synthesis 3atherapeutics 3atissues 3atranscription factors 0aSOX18 0aPancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) 0aCell growth 0aMigration 0aInvasion 0aPrognosis1 aGuo, Huahu1 aZhang, Dafang1 aYu, Xin1 aLeng, Xisheng1 aLi, Shu1 aZhu, Weihua0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2016 Oct. 21, v. 479 p.510-516dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2016.09.0993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01059naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005600094040001800150100001500168245005800183300001600241520013600257592002800393653001200421653001400433653001000447653001600457653001100473700001900484773014100503856011600644852000900760655001200769IND60130564420221119054801.0151127e200603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013056442DNAL7 a10.3157/0002-8320(2006)132[137:NSOHFT]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Ding10aNew species of Hybos from Taiwan (Diptera: Hybotidae)  ap. 137-140.  aTwo species of the genus Hybos, H. taichungensis sp. nov. and H. taiwanensis sp. nov., are described from Taiwan as new to science.  aPublisher supplied data 0aDiptera 0aHybotidae 0aHybos 0anew species 0aTaiwan1 aHorvat, Bogdan0 tTransactions of the American Entomological Society.g2006 Mar., v. 132, no. 1 p.137-140dAmerican Entomological Societyx0002-83207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3157%2F0002-8320%282006%29132%5B137%3ANSOHFT%5D2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03363naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004300113040001800156100002400174245012500198300001600323520154100339592002801880650001401908650002501922650001501947650001101962650001301973650001701986650001202003650001802015650001102033650002402044650001302068650001102081650002002092650001702112650001602129650004102145650004002186650002202226650003602248650004302284650002102327650005302348653001102401653002602412653001302438653001802451653001502469653001702484700001902501700001902520700001702539700001902556773007602575856008902651852000902740655001202749IND60112188420221118230535.0160901e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011218842DNAL7 a234159912pmid7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2013.01.0602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGandhi, M.

When compared to the case without any packing material, the reactor filled with packing materials remarkably facilitated the plasma-induced decomposition of ethylene in the order of α-alumina>silica>zirconia>glass wool (GW). Under identical condition, the increase in the decomposition efficiency (DE) with increasing the specific energy input was more rapid in the plasma reactor filled with the packing materials than in the blank plasma reactor. In the early stage, almost complete decomposition of ethylene was observed with the α-alumina, but after a certain period of time, the DE decreased with time. Unlike the α-alumina, the other packing materials examined did not show any significant deterioration in the decomposition over time during 10-h operation. After the regeneration of the used packing materials by using the plasma in the presence of oxygen, the original decomposition performance was nearly recovered. The decrease in the BET surface area due to the formation of polymer deposits was observed in the used α-alumina and silica; however the surface area was almost regained by the regeneration. While no other byproducts except carbon oxides and N2O were detected with the α-alumina and silica, methane, acetylene, formaldehyde and N2O were identified in the effluent gas with the zirconia and GW packing materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetylene 3aatmospheric pressure 3abyproducts 3acarbon 3aethylene 3aformaldehyde 3amethane 3anitrous oxide 3aoxygen 3apackaging materials 3apolymers 3asilica 3aspecific energy 3asurface area 3atemperature 2aAir Pollutantsxanalysisxchemistry. 2aAir Pollutionxprevention & control 2aChemical Industry 2aEthylenesxanalysisxchemistry. 2aIndustrial Wastexprevention & control 2aModels, Chemical 2aVolatile Organic Compoundsxanalysisxchemistry. 0aPlasma 0aDielectric-packed bed 0aEthylene 0aDecomposition 0aByproducts 0aRegeneration1 aAnanth, Antony1 aMok, Young Sun1 aSong, Jun-Ik1 aPark, Kyu-Hyun0 tChemosphere.g2013 Apr., v. 91 p.685-691dElsevier Ltdx0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2013.01.0603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01430naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002100137245005900158300001600217500002000233520052500253592002800778650002700806650002400833650001100857650002500868700002400893773014300917856007101060852000901131655001201140IND60680284920221122035059.0200104e198308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068028492DNAL7 a10.2307/12405012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQuizon, Jaime B.10aIncome Distribution in Agriculture: A Unified Approach  ap. 526-538.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThis paper develops a class of partial equilibrium models capable of analyzing in a unified way a number of market‐transmitted distributional consequences of a variety of exogenous shocks in agriculture.

For the recovery of metal ions by microorganisms, cell surface design is an effective strategy for the molecular breeding of bioadsorbents as an alternative to intracellular accumulation. The cell surface display of known metal-binding proteins/peptides and the molecular design of novel metal-binding proteins/peptides have been performed using a cell surface engineering approach. The adsorption of specific metal ions is the important challenge for the practical recovery of metal ions. In this paper, we discuss the recent progress in surface-engineered bioadsorbents for the recovery of metal ions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3abreeding 3aengineering 3agenetic engineering 3ametal ions 3amicroorganisms 3apeptides 3apollution 3aproteins1 aUeda, Mitsuyoshi0 tCurrent opinion in biotechnology.g2011 June, v. 22, no. 3 p.427-433dElsevier Ltdx0958-16697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.copbio.2010.12.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01469naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245004700171300001600218520059300234592002800827650003000855650002800885651001000913653002000923653001900943773013400962856008601096852000901182655001201191IND60794428720221122092725.0220923e20220903xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079442872DNAL7 a10.1080/00207233.2021.19747562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAgarwala, Nitin10aChina: combating environmental degradation  ap. 775-798.  aReforms in China began in the late 1970s.

The graphical lasso, which involves maximizing the Gaussian log likelihood subject to a lasso penalty, is a well-studied approach for this task. A surprising connection between the graphical lasso and hierarchical clustering is introduced: the graphical lasso in effect performs a two-step procedure, in which (1) single linkage hierarchical clustering is performed on the variables in order to identify connected components, and then (2) a penalized log likelihood is maximized on the subset of variables within each connected component. Thus, the graphical lasso determines the connected components of the estimated network via single linkage clustering. The single linkage clustering is known to perform poorly in certain finite-sample settings. Therefore, the cluster graphical lasso, which involves clustering the features using an alternative to single linkage clustering, and then performing the graphical lasso on the subset of variables within each cluster, is proposed. Model selection consistency for this technique is established, and its improved performance relative to the graphical lasso is demonstrated in a simulation study, as well as in applications to a university webpage and a gene expression data sets.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aInternet 3adata collection 3agene expression 3amodels 0aSingle linkage clustering 0aHierarchical clustering 0aSparsity 0aNetwork 0aHigh-dimensional setting1 aWitten, Daniela1 aShojaie, Ali0 tComputational statistics & data analysis.g2015 May, v. 85 p.23-36dElsevier B.V.wJournal:3109x0167-94737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.csda.2014.11.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02187naa a2200265 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075024005100099040001800150100002500168245007000193300001600263500000900279520128200288592002801570650002101598650002301619650001601642700002301658773012101681852000901802856009801811655001201909991579247870742620221123022156.0191122e197807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7891394302DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci1978.0011183X001800040019x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShanmugasundaran, S.10aPhotoperiod and Critical Duration for Flower Induction in Soybean  ap. 598-601.  aepub  aA photoperiod sensitive (sensitive) soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] line and photoperiod in sensitive (insensitive) line were used to determine the critical seedling stage before possible floral induction and the length of photoinduction required for anthesis. Seedlings of each entry were grown in pots and subjected to either a 10- hour or 16-hour photoperiod. Beginning 3 days after emergence, two pots per entry in the 10-hour room were exchanged daily with two pots from the 16-hour photoperiod. No detectable differences between treatments were observed in the flowering time of the insensitive fine. However, the sensitive line exhibited the following: (i) The number of days to first flowering was not affected by the transfer from a 16-hour to a 10-hour photoperiod up to 9 days after emergence; (ii) Plants moved from a 10-hour to a 16-hour photoperiod before 36 days after emergence did not flower, indicating that induction was completed at 36 days after emergence; (iii) The earliest anthesis occurred 46 days after emergence. Therefore, we concluded that the induction period was 27 short days (10 hours) and that anthesis occurred 10 days after the completion of induction.

Relationships between land cover, housing characteristics, and resident socioeconomic status across ecoregions  ap. 464-475.  aResidential development is one of the most intensive and widespread land uses in the United States, with substantial environmental impacts, including changes in forest cover. However, the relationships between forest cover and residential development are complex. Contemporary forest cover reflects multiple factors, including housing density, time since development, historical land cover, and land management since development. We investigated how forest cover varies with housing density, housing age, and household income over a range of development intensities, in six ecoregions within New York State, Wisconsin, and Colorado. We find areas with residential development do retain important forest resources: across landscapes they are typically more forested than areas that remain undeveloped. However, forest cover consistently had a negative, inverse relationship with housing density, across study areas. Relationships between forest cover and housing age and household income were less common and often restricted to only portions of a given region, according to geographically weighted regression analyses. A better understanding of how forest cover varies with residential development, outside of the typically studied urban areas, will be essential to maintaining ecosystem function and services in residential landscapes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aecological function 3aecoregions 3aenvironmental impact 3aforest resources 3aforests 3ahousehold income 3aland cover 3aland use 3alandscapes 3aregression analysis 3asocioeconomic status 3aurban areas 3aurbanization 3aColorado 3aNew York 3aWisconsin 0aResidential development 0aForest 0aLand cover 0aHousing 0aSprawl1 aLocke, Dexter H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2704-97201 aStewart, Susan I.1 aHammer, Roger B.1 aRadeloff, Volker C.0 tJournal of environmental management.g2019 Mar. 15, v. 234 p.464-475dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2018.12.0013Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/FS  aDNAL 7aarticle02148naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002800147245006300175500001900238520112200257592002801379650000801407650001401415650001601429650002001445650001901465650001501484700002101499700003001520700002701550700002001577773012301597856008101720852000901801655001201810IND60670047720221122052926.0190925e20190806xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067004772DNAL7 a10.3390/epigenomes30300142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFiorenzano, Alessandro 10aLncRNAs and PRC2: Coupled Partners in Embryonic Stem Cells  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe power of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) lies in their ability to self-renew and differentiate. Behind these two unique capabilities is a fine-tuned molecular network that shapes the genetic, epigenetic, and epitranscriptomic ESC plasticity. Although RNA has been shown to be functionally important in only a small minority of long non-coding RNA genes, a growing body of evidence has highlighted the pivotal and intricate role of lncRNAs in chromatin remodeling. Due to their multifaceted nature, lncRNAs interact with DNA, RNA, and proteins, and are emerging as new modulators of extensive gene expression programs through their participation in ESC-specific regulatory circuitries. Here, we review the tight cooperation between lncRNAs and Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), which is intimately involved in determining and maintaining the ESC epigenetic landscape. The lncRNA-PRC2 partnership is fundamental in securing the fully pluripotent state of ESCs, which must be primed to differentiate properly. We also reflect on the advantages brought to this field of research by the advent of single-cell analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3achromatin 3aepigenetics 3agene expression 3anon-coding RNA 3aplasticity1 aPascale, Emilia 1 aPatriarca, Eduardo  Jorge1 aMinchiotti, Gabriella 1 aFico, Annalisa 0 tEpigenomes.g2019 Aug. 06, v. 3, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27133x2075-46557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/epigenomes30300143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02678naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245009800161300001400259520134300273592002801616650001801644650000801662650001601670650002501686650002301711650001001734650002101744650001601765650001201781650001601793650001401809650001301823650001401836700002001850700001601870700001801886700001501904700001501919700001301934700001301947700001901960700001801979773010901997856008102106852000902187655001202196IND60485970420221117160642.0160218e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048597042DNAL7 a10.1007/s00203-015-1161-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Dan10aConstruction and pilot screening of a signature-tagged mutant library of Sinorhizobium fredii  ap. 91-99.  aSinorhizobium fredii is well known for its ability to establish symbiosis with diverse legumes such as Glycine max (soybean, determinate nodules) and Cajanus cajan (pigeon pea, indeterminate nodules). In order to make screening of S. fredii genes related to symbiosis cost-effective, we constructed a large Tn5 insertion mutant library of S. fredii CCBAU45436 using the signature-tagged mutagenesis (STM) technique. This STM library contains a total of 25,500 independent mutants distributed in 17 sublibraries tagged by corresponding distinct DNA bar-code sequences. After the pilot screening of 255 mutants in 15 batches, Tag85-4, Tag4-17, Tag4-11 and Tag10-13 were found to have attenuated competitiveness (0–30 % in nodule occupation) compared to the wild-type strain when inoculated on soybean. Further characterization of these mutants suggests that Tag4-11 (a pyrC mutant) and Tag10-13 (a nrdJ mutant) are defective in establishing symbiosis with soybean. The pyrC mutant induced uninfected pseudonodules while the nrdJ mutant formed significantly more nodules containing bacteroids with poor persistence ability. When these two mutants were tested on pigeon pea, host-specific symbiotic defects were found. These results demonstrated the STM library as a valuable resource for identifying S. fredii genes relevant to symbiosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCajanus cajan 3aDNA 3aGlycine max 3aSinorhizobium fredii 3acost effectiveness 3agenes 3ahost specificity 3amutagenesis 3amutants 3apigeon peas 3ascreening 3asoybeans 3asymbiosis1 aWang, Yuan Chun1 aWu, Li Juan1 aLiu, Jian Xin1 aZhang, Pan1 aJiao, Jian1 aYan, Hui1 aLiu, Tao1 aTian, Chang Fu1 aChen, Wen Xin0 tArchives of microbiology.g2016 Mar., v. 198, no. 2 p.91-99dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0302-89337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00203-015-1161-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03491naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003000151245016100181300001600342520195100358592002802309650002102337650002502358650001602383650001302399650001202412650002902424650002502453650002202478650000902500650001602509650002602525651001002551653001902561653001602580653002302596653002802619653002502647653002102672700005702693700002402750700003402774773011802808856008602926852000903012655001203021IND60625189420221120064700.0201230e20190215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062518942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2018.12.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGutiérrez-Peña, Rosario10aCarbon footprint of dairy goat production systems: A comparison of three contrasting grazing levels in the Sierra de Grazalema Natural Park (Southern Spain)  ap. 993-998.  aThe main objective of this study was to analyze the carbon footprint (CF) of grazing dairy goat systems in a natural park according to their grazing level. A total of 16 representative grazing goat farms in southern Spain were selected and grouped into three farming systems: low productivity grazing farms (LPG), more intensified grazing farms (MIG) and high productivity grazing farms (HPG). Their CF was analyzed, including greenhouse gas emissions and soil C sequestration according to the farms' grazing level and milk productivity, taking into account different functional units (one kilogram of fat and protein corrected milk (FPCM) and one hectare) and milk correction. Results showed that all variables differed according to the milk correction applied as the values for cow's milk correction were 41% lower than for sheep's milk correction. Total emissions and contributions of soil carbon sequestration differed according to farming system group; LPG farms had higher total emissions than MIG and HPG farms, however total carbon sequestration was lower in the MIG farms than in the LPG and HPG farms. The CF values ranged from 2.36 to 1.76 kg CO₂e kg⁻¹ FPCM for sheep's milk correction and from 1.40 to 1.04 kg CO₂e kg⁻¹ FPCM for cow's milk correction. No differences were found between farming system groups in either of the two cases but when calculations took hectare of land as a functional unit, the contribution of MIG farms to the CF was 85% higher than LPG and HPG farms. Therefore it is important to take into account the functional unit used to calculate the CF by analyzing this indicator in a broader context, and including carbon sequestration by grazing livestock in the calculation. In order to reduce the CF of this type of system, it is advisable to make appropriate use of the natural resources and to reach an optimum level of milk productivity, high enough for pastoral livestock farming to be viable.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon footprint 3acarbon sequestration 3adairy goats 3aewe milk 3agrazing 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3aliquid petroleum gas 3alivestock farming 3amilk 3apastoralism 3aproduction technology 3aSpain 0aProtected area 0aDairy goats 0aGrazing management 0aGreenhouse gas emission 0aCarbon sequestration 0aCarbon footprint1 aMena, Yolanda1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4249-17711 aBatalla, Inmaculada1 aMancilla-Leytón, Juan Manuel0 tJournal of environmental management.g2019 Feb. 15, v. 232 p.993-998dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2018.12.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01619naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245012900163300001800292520055800310592002800868650002000896650002300916650001000939650001800949650001300967650001800980650001500998650001701013650001301030700001801043700001901061773010501080856007501185852000901260655001201269IND60577722220221123034811.0170810e20120612xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057772222DNAL7 a10.1021/ma300271k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTyrrell, Zachary

This was derived from RedEdge-M directional reflectance and a vineyard 3D surface model generated from the same imagery. The model was used to correct the angular effects in the reflectance images to form normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) orthomosaics of different view angles. The results showed that the effect could be corrected to a certain scope, but not completely. There are three drawbacks that might restrict a successful angular model construction and correction: (1) the observable micro shadow variation on the canopy enabled by the high resolution; (2) the complexity of vine canopies that causes an inconsistency between reflectance and canopy geometry, including effects such as micro shadows and near-infrared (NIR) additive effects; and (3) the resolution limit of a 3D model to represent the accurate real-world optical geometry. The conclusion is that grape canopies might be too inhomogeneous for the tested method to perform the angular correction in high quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadditive effect 3acanopy 3agrapes 3aimage analysis 3alandscapes 3amodels 3anear-infrared spectroscopy 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3areflectance 3aremote sensing 3aunmanned aerial vehicles 3avines 3avineyards 3aviticulture1 aBuddenbaum, Henning 1 aRetzlaff, Rebecca 1 aUdelhoven, Thomas 0 tRemote Sensing.g2019 Oct. 31, v. 11, no. 21dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs112125613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03413naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245011800177300001600295520183200311592002802143650001102171650001702182650002502199650001502224650002502239650002102264650001302285650001902298650001502317650001102332650001902343650002102362650001202383650001202395650001502407650002502422650001002447650001502457651001902472653001502491653001802506653001802524653001402542653002902556700006002585700002502645773011802670856008602788852000902874655001202883IND60625189520221120064552.0201230e20190215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062518952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2018.12.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYates, Christopher A.10aCharacterisation of treated effluent from four commonly employed wastewater treatment facilities: A UK case study  ap. 919-927.  aSewage treatment systems are a common feature across the landscape of the United Kingdom, serving an estimated 96% of the population and discharging approximately eleven billion litres of treated wastewater daily. While large treatment facilities are ubiquitous across the landscape, they are not the only method employed in domestic wastewater treatment. This study investigates whether differences in nutrient export (carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus) and organic matter composition (determined by optical indices, SUVA₂₅₄, S₃₅₀₋₄₀₀ and E₂:E₃) from treated effluent could be detected between four of the most common facilities employed in the treatment of wastewater across the UK. Set in the context of the River Wylye, a small headwater catchment, treatment facilities studied included; a septic tank system, small packet treatment works, and two large sewage treatment works, one of which employed phosphorus stripping for phosphorus removal. Inorganic N and P concentrations ranged between 7.51 and 42.4 mg N l⁻¹ and 0.22 and 8.9 mg P l⁻¹ respectively, with DOC concentrations ranging between 1.63 and 11.8 mg C l⁻¹. Optical indices were comparable to those observed in catchments where organic matter is dominated by autochthonous production, suggesting the dominance of low molecular weight material when compared to values observed across temperate aquatic systems. Combining data from both the Environment Agency and Ordinance Survey we estimate that only 15% of domestic properties not connected to mains sewerage in the study catchment have an Environment Agency consent/exemption permit. This calculation suggests that the quantity of small point sources are significantly underestimated, undermining efforts under current legislation to improve stream ecosystem health.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acase studies 3aenvironmental health 3alandscapes 3alaws and regulations 3amolecular weight 3anitrogen 3aorganic matter 3aphosphorus 3arivers 3aseptic systems 3asewage treatment 3astreams 3asurveys 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 3awater 3awatersheds 3aUnited Kingdom 0aWastewater 0aWater quality 0aPoint sources 0aNutrients 0aDissolved organic matter1 aJohnes, Penny J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1605-68961 aSpencer, Robert G.M.0 tJournal of environmental management.g2019 Feb. 15, v. 232 p.919-927dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2018.12.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04169naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002400155245019200179520241300371592002802784650002202812650001302834650002502847650001202872650001702884650001002901650001702911650001502928650001702943650001602960650001502976650001402991650001603005650002603021650001403047650001003061650001203071650003803083650001803121650002203139650001303161650002603174650002003200651001103220653001303231653001803244653001603262700001803278700002003296700002203316700001803338700002603356773009803382856009003480852000903570655001203579IND60684076920221119050242.0200405e20200530xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068407692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2020.7350972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDahle, Stine Wiborg10aProduction of lumpfish (Cyclopterus lumpus L.) in RAS with distinct water treatments: Effects on fish survival, growth, gill health and microbial communities in rearing water and biofilm  aLumpfish (Cyclopterus lumpus L.) in Norway is currently produced in traditional flow-through systems (FTS). Hatcheries frequently show signs of bacterial infections, unstable microbial communities in the rearing water and varying mortality. Recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) is proposed to create stable and healthy microbial environments, with less probabilities for blooming of opportunistic microbes. Studies have also shown that RAS increases the survival of marine fish. The aim with this study was to investigate the effect of various RAS water treatment designs on water and biofilm microbiota, survival, growth and gill health of lumpfish. An experiment with lumpfish was conducted, from 2 months post hatch to the transfer into sea cages. Five different water treatment regimens were compared: 1. RAS with no additional water treatment, 2. RAS with a filtration unit for removal of small particles, 3. RAS with filtration and disinfection with UV-irradiation, 4. RAS with filtration and disinfection with UV-irradiation and ozone and 5. FTS as a reference. The microbiota of the rearing water and tank wall biofilm were sampled and characterized by Illumina sequencing of 16S rDNA amplicons. Lumpfish juveniles reared in the RAS treatments were exposed to a more stable and diverse rearing water microbiota, with a lower share of opportunistic bacteria, a probable reason for the higher survival and better gill health of the fish compared to siblings reared in the FTS. Lumpfish reared in RAS without disinfection were exposed to a more diverse and stable water microbiota, with a lower share of opportunistic and potential harmful bacteria, compared to the lumpfish reared in RAS with disinfection and FTS. This resulted in better gill health. Fish in RAS with filtration, but no disinfection, had a better gill health than the fish in the RAS without filtration, possibly due to the reduction of small particles. The lumpfish were exposed to different microbial communities of both water and biofilm, due to the different treatments of the incoming tank water. In conclusion, our results indicate that implementation of RAS in the production of lumpfish has a potential to increase both survival, growth and gill health of the fish and that RAS with filtration of small particles, but without disinfection, result in the best fish health and performance among the investigated treatments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCylopterus lumpus 3abacteria 3abacterial infections 3abiofilm 3acage culture 3acages 3adisinfection 3afiltration 3afish culture 3afish health 3ahatcheries 3ajuveniles 3amarine fish 3amicrobial communities 3amortality 3aozone 3arearing 3arecirculating aquaculture systems 3aribosomal DNA 3asequence analysis 3asiblings 3aultraviolet radiation 3awater treatment 3aNorway 0aLumpfish 0aWater quality 0aGill health1 aBakke, Ingrid1 aBirkeland, Mari1 aNordøy, Kristian1 aDalum, Alf S.1 aAttramadal, Kari J.K.0 tAquaculture.g2020 May 30, v. 522 p.735097-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2020.7350973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03343naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100006000155245014400215300001600359520140300375592002801778650002901806650002701835650002101862650002601883650002601909650001301935650001701948650001801965650002301983650002102006650001502027650001602042650004302058650002302101650003102124653002902155653002702184653001602211653001402227653001302241700001902254700006202273700002002335700002202355700005602377700002002433700002202453700002502475773019002500856009002690852000902780655001202789IND60564221620221119015142.0180830e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056422162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2016.12.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLatham, Roger D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6621-194913aAn isolate of Haemophilus haemolyticus produces a bacteriocin-like substance that inhibits the growth of nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae  ap. 503-506.  aNontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) frequently colonises the upper respiratory tract and is an important cause of respiratory infections. Resistance to antibiotics is an emerging trend in NTHi and alternative prevention or treatment strategies are required. Haemophilus haemolyticus is a common commensal occupying the same niche as NTHi and, if able to produce substances that inhibit NTHi growth, may have a role as a probiotic. In this study, ammonium sulphate extracts from broth culture of 100 H. haemolyticus isolates were tested for the presence of substances inhibitory to NTHi using a well diffusion assay. One isolate produced a substance that consistently inhibited the growth of NTHi. The substance was inactivated by protease enzymes and had a molecular size of ca. 30 kDa as determined by size exclusion chromatography. When the substance was tested against bacteria from eight Gram-negative and three Gram-positive genera, only Haemophilus spp. were inhibited. Quantitative PCR testing showed the substance to be different to ‘haemocin’, the previously described bacteriocin of H. influenzae type b. These molecular characteristics, together with narrow-spectrum activity, suggest the substance may be a novel bacteriocin, and there is potential for this H. haemolyticus isolate to function as a probiotic for reduction of colonisation and subsequent infection with NTHi.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHaemophilus haemolyticus 3aHaemophilus influenzae 3aammonium sulfate 3aanti-infective agents 3aantibiotic resistance 3abacteria 3abacteriocins 3aculture media 3agel chromatography 3amolecular weight 3aprobiotics 3aproteinases 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arespiratory system 3arespiratory tract diseases 0aHaemophilus haemolyticus 0aHaemophilus influenzae 0aBacteriocin 0aProbiotic 0aHaemocin1 aGell, David A.1 aFairbairn, Rory L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8259-25341 aLyons, A.

Their ingestion has been documented in several species worldwide, but the impact of specific anthropogenic activities remains largely unexplored. In this study, MPs were characterized in different benthic fish sampled after 2.5 years of huge engineering operations for the parbuckling project on the Costa Concordia wreck at Giglio Island. Fish collected in proximity of the wreck showed a high ingestion of microplastics compared to both fish from a control area and values reported worldwide. Also the elevated percentage of nylon, polypropylene lines and the presence of polystyrene are quite unusual for marine organisms sampled in natural field conditions, thus supporting the possible relationship of ingested microplastics with maritime operations during wreck removal. On the other hand, the use of transplanted mussels revealed a lower frequency of ingested MPs, and did not discriminate differences between the wreck and the control area. Some variations were observed in terms of typology and size of particles between surface- and bottom-caged mussels highlighting the influence of a different distribution of MPs along the water column. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that MPs pollution in the area of Costa Concordia was more evident on benthonic environment than on seawater column, providing novel insights on the possibility of using appropriate sentinel organisms for monitoring specific anthropogenic sources of MPs pollution in the marine environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropogenic activities 3acase studies 3aengineering 3aenvironmental monitoring 3afish 3aingestion 3amarine environment 3amussels 3anylon 3aplastics 3apollution 3apolystyrenes 3aseawater 0aMicroplastics 0aIngestion 0aFish 0aMussels 0aBiomonitoring 0aMediterranean1 aCardelli, Lara Roberta1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1159-85761 aGorbi, Stefania1 aPellegrini, David1 aRegoli, Francesco1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6084-61880 tEnvironmental pollution.g2017 Aug., v. 227 p.207-214dElsevier Ltdx0269-74917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2017.04.0663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02528naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002200141245008400163300001600247520116800263592002801431650002701459650002801486650001401514650001001528650001601538650001301554650001301567650001201580650001801592650001401610650001501624650000901639650001701648653001401665653002301679653001101702653002001713653001401733653001001747700002701757700001901784700002001803773013701823856007701960852000902037655001202046IND60131733920221120075106.0151127e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013173392DNAL7 a10.1638/2011-0235.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchrader, Gabby M10aConservative management of pyothorax in an amur tiger (panthera tigris altaica)  ap. 425-429.  aTherapy for pyothorax, or pleural empyema, has not been described for large felids. This case describes the successful treatment of pyothorax in a captive, large felid.

Management of pyothorax cases in companion animals often involves thoracostomy tube placement with recurrent drainage of the pleural cavity, intensive supportive care, and monitoring. In this case, conservative management was elected because hospitalization was not a viable option. Thoracocentesis was performed to drain as much fluid from the chest cavity as possible, yielding more than 1.3 L. Corynebacterium sp. and unidentified anaerobic gram-positive cocci were cultured. Treatment included cefovecin subcutaneously, oral antibiotic therapy with clindamycin and marbofloxacin, meloxicam, and restricted exercise by minimizing access to the main exhibit. Significant improvement was noted clinically and radiographically 6 wk later, and no relapses were noted in the following weeks.

Leaf structure, stomatal structure, gas exchange and chlorophyll a fluorescence, photosynthetic pigments, antioxidant defense system and lipid peroxidation were measured in three replicated chambers. Results showed that E-O3 significantly reduced abaxial epidemis thickness, but no effects on the thicknesses of adaxial epidemis, palisade parenchyma and spongy parenchyma. Stomatal area, density and conductance were not significantly affected by E-O3. E-O3 significantly accelerated leaf senescence, as indicated by increased lipid peroxidation and more declines in light-saturated photosynthetic rate and pigments contents. The reduced ascorbate content (ASC) was decreased but antioxidant enzyme activity (CAT, APX and SOD) and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) were significantly increased by E-O3 among cultivars. The cultivars with visible symptoms also had more reductions in net photosynthetic rate than those without visible symptoms. Ozone sensitivity among cultivars was strongly linked to leaf mass per area (LMA), antioxidant enzymes activity e.g. SOD, APX rather than stomatal parameters (stomatal area, density and conductance) and ASC. Results could provide a theoretical basis for selecting and breeding the ozone-resistant cultivars of peach trees grown in high O3-polluted regions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPrunus persica 3aair 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3aascorbate peroxidase 3abreeding 3acatalase 3achlorophyll 3acultivars 3aecophysiology 3aenzyme activity 3afluorescence 3agas exchange 3agrowing season 3aleaves 3alipid peroxidation 3aozone 3aparenchyma (plant tissue) 3apeaches 3aphotosynthesis 3apigments 3aplanting 3aseedlings 3astomatal conductance 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atrees 3aChina 0aOzone 0aPrunus persica 0aLeaf mass per area 0aAntioxidant defense 0aStomatal conductance1 aLi, Pin1 aShang, Bo1 aLiu, Shuo1 aYang, Aizhen1 aWang, Younian1 aFeng, Zhaozhong0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2017 Aug., v. 227 p.380-388dElsevier Ltdx0269-74917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2017.04.0683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03587naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245016700163300001600330520197100346592002802317650002402345650001002369650001402379650001102393650000902404650001702413650001502430650002302445650001102468650001202479650001302491650001402504650001802518650001702536650001102553650002002564650001202584650002302596650001502619651001502634651001802649700002102667700002202688700001902710700001802729700002002747700001502767700002002782700002002802773010902822856008102931852000903012655001203021IND60575045320221121052806.0170728e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057504532DNAL7 a10.1007/s00027-017-0525-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPyron, Mark10aAre long-term fish assemblage changes in a large US river related to the Asian Carp invasion? Test of the hostile take-over and opportunistic dispersal hypotheses  ap. 631-642.  aGizzard shad is a dominant planktivore/detritivore in the Wabash River, and populations crashed in the early 1990s. Previous work (1974–2008) identified a substantial shift in body-size structure and functional trait composition in the Wabash River fish assemblage between 1989 and 1996. Invasive Asian Carp appeared in the Ohio River basin including the Wabash River in the 1990s. Our goal was to test for temporal changes in assemblage composition and trophic structure relative to the invasion of Asian carp from the early 1990s. We hypothesized that establishment of Asian Carp was a contributor to the assemblage composition shift, and that their presence altered the trophic pathways and food sources of native fishes including Gizzard Shad (hostile takeover hypothesis). Alternatively, Asian Carp may have found success through capitalizing on an empty niche, likely left vacant by the decline in Gizzard Shad, or abundance changes in other trophic groups (opportunistic hypothesis). We utilized archival fish and mussel collections to test for trophic changes in the ecosystem using δ¹³C and δ¹⁵N stable isotope analyses. We examined stomach contents of the dominant planktivore/detritivore consumer, Gizzard Shad, from archival and recent collections to test for changes in the phytoplankton community. Stable isotopes indicated a community reliance on other, more deplete, carbon sources than indicated by the algae, and a slight increase between the δ¹³C time periods. Although all functional feeding groups of fishes indicated some reduction in δ¹⁵N, the differences were only significant for omnivores, mussels, and planktivore/detritivores. Although Asian Carp may have contributed to the collapse of Gizzard Shad populations, other stressors were likely more important drivers of their decline. This is the first, albeit indirect, evidence of opportunistic “invasion” as opposed to the historically presumed hostile takeover model.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDorosoma cepedianum 3aalgae 3abody size 3acarbon 3acarp 3adetritivores 3aecosystems 3aindigenous species 3amodels 3amussels 3anitrogen 3aomnivores 3aphytoplankton 3aplanktivores 3arivers 3astable isotopes 3astomach 3atemporal variation 3awatersheds 3aOhio River 3aUnited States1 aBecker, Jesse C.1 aBroadway, Kyle J.1 aEtchison, Luke1 aMinder, Mario1 aDeColibus, Dawn1 aChezem, M.1 aWyatt, Kevin H.1 aMurry, Brent A.0 tAquatic sciences.g2017 July, v. 79, no. 3 p.631-642dSpringer International Publishingx1015-16217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00027-017-0525-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03051naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245010300163300001600266520146800282592002801750650002401778650002501802650001601827650001601843650001301859650001001872650001901882650001501901650000901916650001001925650001501935650001701950650002201967650001801989650001402007650002002021650001302041650002402054650005202078650002002130650003502150650001202185650001202197700001302209700001102222700001302233700001502246700001502261700001502276773010102291856008402392852000902476655001202485IND60122001120221118200220.0150324e20131001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012200112DNAL7 a10.1080/00071668.2013.8194882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, C.10aMolecular cloning, expression and association study with reproductive traits of the duck LRP8 gene  ap. 567-574.  a1. Two splice variants of duck LRP8 were identified, one containing 8 ligand-binding repeats (LRP8-1) and the other containing only 7 repeats (LRP8-2). The two transcripts share ~71–91% nucleic acid identity and ~65–94% amino acid identity with their counterparts in other species. A phylogenetic tree based on amino acid sequences shows that duck LRP8 proteins are closely related to those of chicken, turkey and zebra finch. 2. The semi-quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)analysis indicates that the two transcripts are expressed in all the examined tissues, and the LRP8-1 transcript is more highly expressed in hypothalamus, ovary and pituitary gland than in other detected tissues. 3. Six single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified in the coding region. Association analysis demonstrated that the c.528C > T genotypes were associated with egg production (EP) (EP210d, EP300d and EP360d), age at laying the first egg (AFE) and body weight at sexual maturity (BWSM). The c.1371A > G genotypes were associated with egg production (EP210d, EP300d and EP360d). 4. The haplotypes of c.528C > T and c.1371A > G were associated with EP (EP210d, EP300d and EP360d), yolk weight (YW), albumen weight (AW), egg weight (EW), BWSM and the first egg weight (FEW). 5. Duck LRP8 gene was associated with some reproductive traits and is an important candidate gene for the genetic selection of improved reproductive traits.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTaeniopygia guttata 3aamino acid sequences 3aamino acids 3abody weight 3achickens 3aducks 3aegg production 3aegg weight 3aeggs 3agenes 3ahaplotypes 3ahypothalamus 3amolecular cloning 3anucleic acids 3aphylogeny 3apituitary gland 3aproteins 3areproductive traits 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asexual maturity 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3atissues 3aturkeys1 aLi, S.J.1 aLi, C.1 aYu, G.H.1 aFeng, Y.P.1 aPeng, X.L.1 aGong, Y.Z.0 tBritish poultry science.g2013 Oct. 1, v. 54, no. 5 p.567-574dTaylor & Francisx1466-17997nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00071668.2013.8194883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02397naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002300143245012800166300001600294520118400310592002801494650001401522650001401536650002201550650002201572650001301594650001201607650001401619650001601633650001401649650001401663650002101677651002301698653001301721653001101734653001501745653001201760653001201772773010501784856007701889852000901966655001201975IND60555432020221118010305.0161028e20160901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055543202DNAL7 a10.1139/cjb-2016-00352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAtkinson, Brian A.10aEarly diverging asterids of the Late Cretaceous: Suciacarpa starrii gen. et sp. nov. and the initial radiation of Cornales1  ap. 759-771.  aTwo permineralized cornalean fruits from the Campanian of the state of Washington in the northwestern United States were studied using the cellulose acetate peel technique. One specimen was reconstructed three-dimensionally using ImageJ software. Fruits are ellipsoidal and consist of valvate endocarps. Valves are restricted to the apical third of the endocarp. Endocarps are tetralocular and each locule is crescent-shaped in cross section. The valve tissue consists of isodiametric sclereids and secretory cavities. Septae are composed of transversely elongated sclereids and secretory cavities. In each septum there are roughly two rows of vascular bundles that extend the length of the fruit. There is one apically attached seed per locule. These fossil fruits display a unique mosaic of characters indicative of Cornaceae, Nyssaceae, Davidiaceae, and Mastixiaceae, but not conforming to any one of these extant families. Therefore, they are assigned to a new genus and species within Cornales, Suciacarpa starrii gen. et sp. nov. The novel combination of characters of Suciacarpa sheds light on the early evolution of Cornales and supports previous phylogenetic hypotheses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCornaceae 3aNyssaceae 3acellulose acetate 3acomputer software 3aendocarp 3afossils 3anew genus 3anew species 3aphylogeny 3asclereids 3avascular bundles 3aWashington (state) 0aCornales 0aCornus 0aCretaceous 0aDavidia 0afossils0 tBotany.g2016 Sept. 1, v. 94, no. 9 p.759-771dNRC Research PresswJournal:jnl44657x1916-28047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjb-2016-00353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02042naa a2200253 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075024005100099040001800150100001600168245007900184300001600263500000900279520117200288592002801460650002101488650002301509650001601532773012101548852000901669856009801678655001201776991579244280742620221122201319.0191122e197807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7891394552DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci1978.0011183X001800040044x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWolf, D.

TNC determinations involve considerable time and expense after the root samples are obtained. An alternative gravimetric method is pro. posed that involves determining percentage dry matter (DM). Tap roots are dug from the field, and the crown and lateral roots are removed. The remaining root is trimmed to a 10-cm length, cleaned free of soil, and soaked in water for 2 hours. Root segments are blotted dry with paper towels and weighed (saturated weight). Roots are then oven dried and weighed (dry weight). Dry matter is expressed as a percentage of saturated weight. Experiments conducted over 11 years under a wide range of varieties, plant ages, management practices, and sampling dates indicate highly significant correlations (r² ranged 0.70 to 0.96) between TNC and DM. TNC and DM show similar cyclic patterns caused by plant growth and degree of defoliation. An equation for predicting percent TNC values from percent DM was determined from linear regression analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aplant physiology 3aplant biochemistry 3afield crops0 tCrop science.g1978 July, v. 18, no. 4 p.690-692dCrop Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44570x0011-183X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2135/cropsci1978.0011183X001800040044x3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02451naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002600143245010300169300001600272520102700288592002801315650001001343650002201353650001101375650000901386650001201395650001101407650001001418650001201428650001701440650001701457653001001474653003601484653002201520653002901542653003401571700002701605700003401632700002901666700004001695700002701735773014101762856008101903852000901984655001201993IND60131734220221121235308.0151127e20120920xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013173422DNAL7 a10.1638/2010-0101R1.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMortari, Ana Carolina10aMotor nerve conduction and repetitive nerve stimulation in captive ring-tailed coati (nasua nasua)  ap. 443-449.  aThere are few electrophysiologic studies in wild animals. The aim of this study was to determine normal data for motor nerve conduction studies and repetitive stimulation in sciatic-tibial and ulnar nerves in clinically normal captive coati. Eight adult ring-tailed coatis (Nasua nasua), two females and six males weighing 6–8 kg, were used. Average nerve conduction velocity was 70.81 m/sec (standard deviation [SD] = 3.98) and 56.93 m/sec (SD = 4.31) for the sciatic-tibial and ulnar nerves, respectively. Repetitive stimulation responses demonstrated minimal variations of the area of the compound muscle action potentials at low (3 Hz) and high (20 Hz) frequencies. The maximal obtained decremental area response was 8%. These normal data of conduction studies may be used in assessing abnormalities for clinical diagnosis. In addition, the obtained normal repetitive stimulation data were similar to dogs and humans and may be used for post- and presynaptic disturbances of the neuromuscular transmission in coatis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNasua 3aaction potentials 3aadults 3adogs 3afemales 3ahumans 3amales 3amuscles 3anerve tissue 3awild animals 0aCoati 0amotor nerve conduction velocity 0aneurotransmission 0aelectrophysiologic study 0arepetitive nerve stimulation.1 aRahal, Sheila Canevese1 ade Lima Resende, Luiz Antonio1 aTeixeira, Carlos Roberto1 aTeixeira, Rodrigo Hidalgo Friciello1 aMendes, Guilherme Maia0 tJournal of zoo and wildlife medicine.g2012 Sept. 20, v. 43, no. 3 p.443-449dAmerican Association of Zoo Veterinariansx1042-72607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1638/2010-0101R1.13Available from publisher's Web site  aDNAL 7aarticle02844naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100003000140245016700170520154100337592002801878650003101906650001801937650001101955650001901966650002601985650004302011650001102054650001602065650001902081650001102100650002902111651001002140700003102150700003002181700003502211773012902246856007402375852000902449655001202458IND60675925520221120171338.0191112e20191101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067592552DNAL7 a10.3390/rs112125642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLima-Cueto, Francisco  J.10aUsing Vegetation Indices and a UAV Imaging Platform to Quantify the Density of Vegetation Ground Cover in Olive Groves (<i>Olea Europaea</i> L.) in Southern Spain  aIn olive groves, vegetation ground cover (VGC) plays an important ecological role. The EU Common Agricultural Policy, through cross-compliance, acknowledges the importance of this factor, but, to determine the real impact of VGC, it must first be quantified. Accordingly, in the present study, eleven vegetation indices (VIs) were applied to quantify the density of VGC in olive groves (Olea europaea L.), according to high spatial resolution (10&ndash;12 cm) multispectral images obtained by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The fieldwork was conducted in early spring, in a Mediterranean mountain olive grove in southern Spain presenting various VGC densities. A five-step method was applied: (1) generate image mosaics using UAV technology; (2) apply the VIs; (3) quantify VGC density by means of sampling plots (ground-truth); (4) calculate the mean reflectance of the spectral bands and of the VIs in each sampling plot; and (5) quantify VGC density according to the VIs. The most sensitive index was IRVI, which accounted for 82% (p < 0.001) of the variability of VGC density. The capability of the VIs to differentiate VGC densities increased in line with the cover interval range. RVI most accurately distinguished VGC densities > 80% in a cover interval range of 10% (p < 0.001), while IRVI was most accurate for VGC densities < 30% in a cover interval range of 15% (p < 0.01). IRVI, NRVI, NDVI, GNDVI and SAVI differentiated the complete series of VGC densities when the cover interval range was 30% (p < 0.001 and p < 0.05).  aPublisher supplied data 3aCommon Agricultural Policy 3aOlea europaea 3agroves 3aimage analysis 3amultispectral imagery 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3aolives 3areflectance 3aremote sensing 3aspring 3aunmanned aerial vehicles 3aSpain1 aBlanco Sepúlveda, Rafael,1 aGómez-Moreno, María  L.1 aGalacho-Jiménez, Federico  B.0 tRemote Sensing.g2019 Nov. 01, v. 11, no. 21dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs112125643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03612naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245018400163300001600347520196800363592002802331650002202359650002602381650001602407650002402423650001602447650001802463650002102481650002302502650001602525650001802541650000902559650001502568650002002583650001602603650002302619650001002642650001602652650002102668650002502689650002102714650002102735650001502756650001102771650001802782650002102800700001502821700001202836700001602848773010102864856008402965852000903049655001203058IND60122001220221118200219.0150324e20131001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012200122DNAL7 a10.1080/00071668.2013.8253692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, W.10aEvaluation of probiotics in diets with different nutrient densities on growth performance, blood characteristics, relative organ weight and breast meat characteristics in broilers  ap. 635-641.  a1. A total of 720 1-d-old broilers were used in a 28 d experiment to determine the effects of probiotic supplementation in diets with different dietary nutrient densities. 2. Birds were randomly allotted to one of the 4 treatments in a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement (12 replicateswith 15 broilers per replicate) with two levels of nutrient density [high nutrient density (metabolisable energy (ME) 12.7 MJ/kg and crude protein (CP) 230.3 g/kg for 1–7 d; ME 13.2 MJ/kg and CP 220.3 g/kg for 8–28 d) or low nutrient density (ME 12.1 MJ/kg and CP 220.2 g/kg for 0–7 d; ME 12.6 MJ/kg and CP 209.8 g/kg for 8–28 d)] and 0 or 2 g/kg probiotics (1.0 × 10 ¹⁰ viable spores/g of Bacillus subtilis endospores and 1.0 × 10 ⁹ viable spores/g of Clostridium butyricum). 3. The high-nutrient-density diet increased body weight gain (BWG), feed conversion ratio (FCR), serum cholesterol and triglyceride concentration relative to the low-nutrient-density diet. High-nutrient-density diet reduced water loss ratio of breast muscle, liver and fat relative to body weight compared to low-nutrient density-diet. The inclusion of probiotics increased BWG and feed intake throughout the experiment. Dietary probiotics increased the percentage of blood lymphocytes and relative weight of spleen and bursa of Fabricius when compared to the non-probiotic treatment. The inclusion of probiotics decreased serum cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations and lightness (L*) value of breast meat compared to the non-probiotic-supplemented diet. 4. In conclusion, high dietary nutrient density increased growth performance and serum cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations in broiler chickens. The inclusion of probiotics increased growth performance but reduced serum cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations. The positive effect of probiotic supplementation on growth performance was reduced by the high-nutrient-density diet during the first week of life.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus subtilis 3aClostridium butyricum 3ablood serum 3abody weight changes 3abreast meat 3abreast muscle 3abroiler chickens 3abursa of Fabricius 3acholesterol 3acrude protein 3adiet 3aendospores 3afeed conversion 3afeed intake 3agrowth performance 3aliver 3alymphocytes 3ameat composition 3ametabolizable energy 3anutrient content 3anutrient density 3aprobiotics 3aspleen 3atissue weight 3atriacylglycerols1 aWang, J.P.1 aYan, L.1 aHuang, Y.Q.0 tBritish poultry science.g2013 Oct. 1, v. 54, no. 5 p.635-641dTaylor & Francisx1466-17997nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00071668.2013.8253693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02329naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245005000160520145500210592002801665650001401693650001301707650000901720650001901729650002101748650001501769650001201784700001901796773012901815856007401944852000902018655001202027IND60675925620221120171316.0191112e20191101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067592562DNAL7 a10.3390/rs112125652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNgan, A. H. W.,10aSea Ice Remote Sensing Using GNSS-R: A Review  aKnowledge of sea ice is critical for offshore oil and gas exploration, global shipping industries, and climate change studies. During recent decades, Global Navigation Satellite System-Reflectometry (GNSS-R) has evolved as an efficient tool for sea ice remote sensing. In particular, thanks to the availability of the TechDemoSat-1 (TDS-1) data over high-latitude regions, remote sensing of sea ice based on spaceborne GNSS-R has been rapidly growing. The goal of this paper is to provide a review of the state-of-the-art methods for sea ice remote sensing offered by the GNSS-R technique. In this review, the fundamentals of these applications are described, and their performances are evaluated. Specifically, recent progress in sea ice sensing using TDS-1 data is highlighted including sea ice detection, sea ice concentration estimation, sea ice type classification, sea ice thickness retrieval, and sea ice altimetry. In addition, studies of sea ice sensing using airborne and ground-based data are also noted. Lastly, applications based on various platforms along with remaining challenges are summarized and possible future trends are explored. In this review, concepts, research methods, and experimental techniques of GNSS-R-based sea ice sensing are delivered, and this can benefit the scientific community by providing insights into this topic to further advance this field or transfer the relevant knowledge and practice to other studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaltimetry 3alatitude 3aoils 3aremote sensing 3aresearch methods 3asatellites 3asea ice1 aHuang, Weimin 0 tRemote Sensing.g2019 Nov. 01, v. 11, no. 21dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs112125653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03329naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004600094040001800140100001700158245012700175300001600302520178800318592002802106650000802134650001902142650001802161650001602179650002002195650001102215650001102226650001202237650002202249650003002271650002302301650002102324650001002345650001702355650002202372650001902394650001702413651001002430653002202440653002302462653002202485653001002507700002002517773019702537856009202734852000902826655001202835IND60594504620221119163633.0180516e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059450462DNAL7 a10.5814/j.issn.1674-764x.2017.06.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZezhou, Gong10aAssessment of Urban Air Pollution and Spatial Spillover Effects in China: Cases of 113 Key Environmental Protection Cities  ap. 584-594.  aWith rapid urbanization and energy consumption, environmental pollution and degradation have become increasingly serious problems in China. At the beginning of 2013, China implemented new ambient air quality standards (GB 3095-2012) in which the concentration of six pollutants including PM₂.₅, ozone, carbon monoxide, PM₁₀, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide were monitored. This study gathered annual air pollutant concentration data for the six pollutants in 113 key environmental protection cites throughout China in 2014 and 2015 to explain spatial patterns of urban air pollution. Based on the Kernel density estimation method, spatial hotspots of air pollution were illustrated through which spatial cluster of each pollutants could be plotted. By employing an entropy evaluation system, urban air quality was assessed in terms of the six atmospheric pollutants. We conclude that, in general, CO and SO₂ were two important pollutants in most Chinese cities, but this varied greatly among cities. The assessment results indicate that cities with the worst air quality were mainly located in northern and central provinces, dominantly in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei metropolitan area. Regression modeling showed that a combination of meteorological factors and human-related determinants, to say specifically, industrialization and urbanization factors, greatly influenced urban air quality variation in China. Results from spatial lag regression modeling confirmed that air pollution existed obvious spatial spillover effects among key cities. The spatial interdependence effects of urban air quality means that Chinese municipal governments should strengthen regional cooperation and deepen bilateral collaboration in terms of air regulation and pollution prevention.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aair pollutants 3aair pollution 3aair quality 3acarbon monoxide 3acities 3aenergy 3aentropy 3aindustrialization 3ameteorological parameters 3ametropolitan areas 3anitrogen dioxide 3aozone 3aparticulates 3apollution control 3asulfur dioxide 3aurbanization 3aChina 0aurban air quality 0aentropy assessment 0aspatial spillover 0aChina1 aXiaoping, Zhang0 tJournal of resources and ecology.g2017 Nov., v. 8, no. 6 p.584-594dInstitute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of ScienceswJournal:2202x1674-764X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5814/j.issn.1674-764x.2017.06.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02846naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002200143245010100165300001600266520121000282592002801492650002801520650002801548650001701576650001501593650002101608650001501629650001201644650001101656650001901667650001901686650001201705650002301717650002101740650001301761650001401774650001001788650001101798650002101809650001401830653001801844653001001862653001101872653001101883653001201894653001701906700002301923700002501946700002201971700002001993700002402013773014102037856008102178852000902259655001202268IND60131734420221121235339.0151127e20120920xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013173442DNAL7 a10.1638/2010-0160R2.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorris, Alexis L.14aTHE onset of goiter in several species of sharks following the addition of ozone to a touch pool  ap. 621-624.  aThis report describes the onset of goiter in several species of shark following the addition of ozone to a touch pool. A detailed description of a female brown-banded bamboo shark (Chiloscyllium punctatum) that was presented with multinodular goiter is provided. Four other brown-banded bamboo sharks and 11 white-spotted bamboo sharks (Chiloscyllium plagiosum) housed in the same system developed clinical disease consistent with goiter, but two zebra bullhead sharks (Heterodontus zebra) did not. Plasma thyroxine (T₄) concentration was 4.64 ng/ml before euthanasia, consistent with a diagnosis of hypothyroidism. The sharks had been chronically exposed to mean (± standard error) NO₃–N concentrations of 35 ± 5.12 mg/L before ozonation of the system. Ozonation of aquarium water causes a reduction in environmental iodide, which is required for thyroid hormone synthesis. Nitrate is goitrogenic and would further decrease I– absorption by competitive inhibition. Multinodular goiter is consistent with goiter caused by chronic iodide deficiency. Understanding the interaction between water chemistry and goiter development is critical to development of elasmobranch health management systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChiloscyllium plagiosum 3aChiloscyllium punctatum 3aHeterodontus 3aabsorption 3achronic exposure 3aeuthanasia 3afemales 3agoiter 3ahydrochemistry 3ahypothyroidism 3aiodides 3amanagement systems 3anitrate nitrogen 3anitrates 3aozonation 3aozone 3asharks 3athyroid hormones 3athyroxine 0aElasmobranchs 0aozone 0agoiter 0aiodide 0anitrate 0abamboo shark1 aStremme, Donald W.1 aSheppard, Barbara J.1 aWalsh, Michael T.1 aFarina, Lisa L.1 aFrancis-Floyd, Ruth0 tJournal of zoo and wildlife medicine.g2012 Sept. 20, v. 43, no. 3 p.621-624dAmerican Association of Zoo Veterinariansx1042-72607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1638/2010-0160R2.13Available from publisher's Web site  aDNAL 7aarticle03392naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245016100157520198300318592002802301650002402329650002302353650001802376650001702394650001302411650001802424650001902442650001002461650001802471650001902489650002002508650001602528650001902544650001702563650001802580650001602598650001002614650001602624650002102640650001602661651001002677700002302687773012902710856007402839852000902913655001202922IND60675925720221120171325.0191112e20191101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067592572DNAL7 a10.3390/rs112125662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Qiang 10aForest Canopy Height and Gaps from Multiangular BRDF, Assessed with Airborne LiDAR Data (Short Title: Vegetation Structure from LiDAR and Multiangular Data)  aBoth vegetation multi-angular and LiDAR (light detection and ranging) remote sensing data are indirectly and directly linked with 3D vegetation structure parameters, such as the tree height and vegetation gap fraction, which are critical elements in above-ground biomass and light profiles for photosynthesis estimation. LiDAR, particularly LiDAR using waveform data, provides accurate estimates of these structural parameters but suffers from not enough spatial samplings. Structural parameters retrieved from multiangular imaging data through the inversion of physical models have larger uncertainties. This study searches for an analytical approach to fuse LiDAR and multiangular data. We explore the relationships between vegetation structure parameters derived from airborne vegetation LiDAR data and multiangular data and present a new potential angle vegetation index to retrieve the tree height and gap fraction using multi-angular data in Howland Forest, Maine. The BRDF (bidirectional reflectance distribution factor) index named NDMM (normalized difference between the maximum and minimum reflectance) linearly increases with the tree height and decreases with the gap fraction. In addition, these relationships are also dependent on the wavelength, tree species, and stand density. The NDMM index performs better in conifer (R = 0.451 for tree height and R = 0.472 for the gap fraction using the near infrared band) than in deciduous and mixed forests. It is superior in sparse (R = 0.569 for tree height and R = 0.604 for the gap fraction using the near infrared band) compared to dense forest. Moreover, the NDMM index is more strongly related to tree height and the gap fraction at the near infrared band than at the three visible bands. This study sheds light on the possibility of using multiangular data to map vegetation&rsquo;s structural parameters in larger regions for carbon cycle studies through the fusion of LiDAR and multiangular remote sensing data.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaboveground biomass 3aanalytical methods 3acanopy height 3acarbon cycle 3aconifers 3aforest canopy 3aimage analysis 3alidar 3amixed forests 3aphotosynthesis 3aphysical models 3areflectance 3aremote sensing 3aspatial data 3astand density 3atree height 3atrees 3auncertainty 3avegetation index 3awavelengths 3aMaine1 aNi-Meister, Wenge 0 tRemote Sensing.g2019 Nov. 01, v. 11, no. 21dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs112125663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02264naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100003000140245008300170520124900253592002801502650001501530650002001545650001401565650001001579650001601589650001501605650001401620650001901634700002001653700002301673700001801696773012901714856007401843852000901917655001201926IND60675925820221120154622.0191112e20191101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067592582DNAL7 a10.3390/rs112125672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSánchez-Rodríguez, Ana 10aAutomated Inspection of Railway Tunnels’ Power Line Using LiDAR Point Clouds  aTransport networks need periodic inspections to increase their safety and improve their management. In the last few years, LiDAR (light detection and ranging) technology has become a tool for helping to create a precise database of almost any type of infrastructure. Mobile laser scanning (MLS) systems use a laser beam to collect dense three dimensional (3D) point clouds, which include geometric and radiometric data of the environment in which they are placed. In the context of this paper, a methodology for automatically inspecting the clearance gauge and the deflection of the aerial contact line in railway tunnels is presented. The main objective is to compare results and verify their compliance with the Spanish norm. The 3D data are provided by a LYNX Mobile Mapper System (MMS). First, the area is surveyed and then the obtained (3D) point cloud is classified into contact wire, suspension wire, and remaining points. Finally, the inspection of the railway&rsquo;s power line is performed. The validation of the proposed methodology has been carried out in three different tunnel point clouds, obtaining both qualitative and quantitative results for points&rsquo; classification, together with the results of the measures performed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautomation 3adata collection 3adatabases 3alidar 3apower lines 3aradiometry 3arailroads 3aremote sensing1 aSoilán, Mario 1 aCabaleiro, Manuel 1 aArias, Pedro 0 tRemote Sensing.g2019 Nov. 01, v. 11, no. 21dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs112125673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02696naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002800143245010300171300001600274520154600290592002801836650001401864650001701878650002601895650001001921650001201931650001701943650002601960650002001986651002102006653001102027653001402038653000902052653001502061653001202076653001902088773010502107856007702212852000902289655001202298IND60555432420221118010533.0161028e20160823xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055543242DNAL7 a10.1139/cjb-2016-00542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTomescu, Alexandru M.F.14aThe Early Cretaceous Apple Bay flora of Vancouver Island: a hotspot of fossil bryophyte diversity1  ap. 683-695.  aThe pre-Cenozoic bryophyte fossil record is significantly sparser than that of vascular plants or Cenozoic bryophytes. This situation has been traditionally attributed to a hypothesized low preservation potential of the plants. However, instances of excellent pre-Cenozoic bryophyte preservation and the results of experiments simulating fossilization contradict this traditional interpretation, suggesting that bryophytes have good preservation potential. Studies of an anatomically preserved Early Cretaceous (Valanginian) plant fossil assemblage on Vancouver Island (British Columbia), at Apple Bay, focusing on the cryptogamic flora, have revealed an abundant bryophyte component. The Apple Bay flora hosts one of the most diverse bryophyte assemblages worldwide, with at least nine distinct moss types (polytrichaceous, leucobryaceous, tricostate), one complex thalloid liverwort, and two other thalloid plants (representing bryophyte or pteridophyte gametophytes), which contribute a significant fraction of biodiversity to the pre-Cenozoic fossil record of bryophytes. These results (i) corroborate previous observations and studies, indicating that the preservation potential of bryophytes is much better than traditionally thought; (ii) indicate that the bryophyte fossil record is incompletely explored and many more bryophyte fossils are hidden in the rock record, awaiting discovery; and (iii) suggest that the paucity of the pre-Cenozoic bryophyte fossil record is primarily a reflection of inadequate paleobryological capacity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBryophyta 3abiodiversity 3aferns and fern allies 3aflora 3afossils 3agametophytes 3amosses and liverworts 3avascular plants 3aBritish Columbia 0afossil 0abryophyte 0amoss 0aCretaceous 0aanatomy 0apermineralized0 tBotany.g2016 Aug. 23, v. 94, no. 9 p.683-695dNRC Research PresswJournal:jnl44657x1916-28047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjb-2016-00543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01653naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245017900168520056900347592002800916650002900944650001600973650002300989650001201012650001801024650000901042650003501051650002501086650001101111773012501122856008301247852000901330655001201339IND60670048520221122065327.0190925e20190708xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067004852DNAL7 a10.3390/fermentation50300612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPetrov, Mitko 10aModelling and Multi-Criteria Decision Making for Selection of Specific Growth Rate Models of Batch Cultivation by <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> Yeast for Ethanol Production  aThis study is focused on using multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) for selecting specific growth rate models of batch cultivation by the Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

In environmental remediation field, the quest for eco-friendly and green processes has put a growing emphasis on solar-driven photocatalysis. The conventional semiconductor photocatalysts suffer with the shortcoming of electron–hole pair recombination, aggregation and wide band gap, which inhibit their commercialization. Coupling of graphene derivatives, such as graphene oxide (GO) and reduced graphene oxide (RGO), with semiconductors (TiO₂, ZnO) offers a considerable potential to enhance the photocatalytic efficiency by providing higher surface area, stability, and fast electron conduction ability. Numerous papers have been published in recent years which couples Graphene, GO and RGO with different semiconductors for photocatalytic degradation of various organic pollutants. So, it is high time a comprehensive review should be presented to understand the potential and future prospects of photocatalysis in water treatment. This article aims to provide a critical review about recent progress in fabrication methods, modification techniques (non-metal or metal doping), efficiency and mechanism for organic pollutant photo degradation and visible light activation of graphene-based photocatalysts. The role of graphene in photocatalysis and organic pollutant degradation mechanism is summarized. Moreover, novel graphene and layered double hydroxide (LDH) composites are also discussed as potential candidates in wastewater treatment. Furthermore, future prospects and challenges such as separation, recyclability and health hazards of these composites are discussed to provide an outlook about their practical application in water purification.  aPublisher supplied data 3acommercialization 3aenvironmental technology 3agraphene 3agraphene oxide 3alight 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3aphotolysis 3apollutants 3aremediation 3asemiconductors 3asurface area 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 3awater purification 0aGraphene photocatalysts 0aoragnic-pollutant degradation 0aTiO2 0aZnO 0alayered double hydroxide 0aphotodegradation1 aWaheed, Ammara1 aMoazzam Ali, Muhammad1 aMushtaq, Umar0 tEnvironmental Technology reviews.g2021 Jan. 01, v. 10, no. 1 p.323-341dTaylor & FranciswJournal:18396x2162-25237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/21622515.2021.19946583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02088naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245010200167300001600269520102300285592002801308650002101336650001601357650001501373650002601388650001101414650001501425650002001440651001201460700001401472700001701486700001501503700001401518773010101532856008401633852000901717655001201726IND60122001720221118200226.0150324e20131001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012200172DNAL7 a10.1080/00071668.2013.8301742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHoffmann, G.10aSensor-based monitoring of the prevalence and severity of foot pad dermatitis in broiler chickens  ap. 553-561.  a1. The aim of this study was to assess the suitability of a dielectric measurement to evaluate the prevalence and severity of foot pad dermatitis (FPD) in broiler chickens. 2. The study focussed on surveying the occurrence of FPD during the growing period of one broiler chicken flock. A scoring system consisting of 5 categories was used to assess the prevalence and severity of FPD macroscopically. Additionally, the dielectric constant (DC) of both foot pads of 50 chickens was measured in a triple iteration with the MoistureMeter D (Delfin Technologies, Kuopio, Finland) on three different dates. 3. On all measurement days, DC and FPD score were negatively correlated. The severity of FPD increased during the growing period, and severe lesions occurred at an early stage. 4. Further research is necessary to develop an effective early warning system for FPD in poultry houses. However, the non-invasive measurement of DC provides a reliable method for the objective assessment of occurrence and severity of FPD.  aPublisher supplied data 3abroiler chickens 3acorrelation 3adermatitis 3aearly warning systems 3aflocks 3amonitoring 3apoultry housing 3aFinland1 aAmmon, C.1 aVolkamer, L.1 aSürie, C.1 aRadko, D.0 tBritish poultry science.g2013 Oct. 1, v. 54, no. 5 p.553-561dTaylor & Francisx1466-17997nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00071668.2013.8301743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03195naa a2200721 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005800147245006900205300001600274520130900290592002801599650003801627650003001665650001201695650001601707650001801723650001001741650001001751650001601761650001001777650001801787650001601805650001701821650001501838650001001853650001301863650001201876650001501888651001101903651001801914653001501932653001501947653002201962653000901984653001201993653001702005653000702022653000902029653000702038653000902045653000802054653000802062653001002070653000802080653001002088653000802098653000902106653000802115653000802123653001102131700002002142700005902162700001702221700002002238773011202258856008202370852000902452655001202461IND60568047320221122055430.0190401e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056804732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fct.2017.04.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBastaki, Maria1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4487-115010aLack of genotoxicity in vivo for food color additive Tartrazine  ap. 278-284.  aTartrazine is approved as a food color additive internationally with INS number 102, in the United States as food color subject to batch certification “Food, Drug, and Cosmetic” (FD&C) Yellow No. 5, and in Europe as food color additive with E number 102. In their evaluation of the color (2013), the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) expressed concerns of potential genotoxicity, based primarily on one genotoxicity study that was not conducted according to Guidelines. The present in vivo genotoxicity study was conducted according to OECD Guidelines in response to EFSA's request for additional data. The animal species and strain, and the tissues examined were selected specifically to address the previously reported findings. The results of this study show clear absence of genotoxic activity for Tartrazine, in the bone marrow micronucleus assay and the Comet assay in the liver, stomach, and colon. These data addressed EFSA's concerns for genotoxicity. The Joint WHO/FAO Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) (2016) also reviewed these data and concluded that there is no genotoxicity concern for Tartrazine. Negative findings in parallel genotoxicity studies on Allura Red AC and Ponceau 4R (published separately) are consistent with lack of genotoxicity for azo dyes used as food colors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFood and Agriculture Organization 3aWorld Health Organization 3aanimals 3abone marrow 3acertification 3acolon 3acolor 3acomet assay 3adrugs 3afood coloring 3afood safety 3agenotoxicity 3aguidelines 3aliver 3amutagens 3astomach 3atartrazine 3aEurope 3aUnited States 0aFood color 0aTartrazine 0aFD&C Yellow No. 5 0aE102 0aINS 102 0aGenotoxicity 0aCP 0aEFSA 0aEU 0aFD&C 0aGLP 0aINS 0aJECFA 0aMMS 0aMnPCE 0aNCE 0aOECD 0aPCE 0aSCF 0aUS FDA1 aFarrell, Thomas1 aBhusari, Sachin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5178-68811 aPant, Kamala1 aKulkarni, Rohan0 tFood and chemical toxicology.g2017 July, v. 105 p.278-284dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl33424x0278-69157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fct.2017.04.0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04297naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245013200170300001600302520233500318592002802653650002602681650001102707650002202718650002202740650002302762650001602785650001302801650002102814650001102835650002302846650001302869650001202882650001902894650002202913650001502935650001602950650002102966650002002987650001403007650001503021650003103036650001703067650001903084650001803103650001503121650001103136650001403147650001203161650001603173650001403189651001203203653001903215653001303234653001503247653001103262653002203273653001503295700001503310700002303325700001603348700002403364773010403388856008603492852000903578655001203587IND60564222520221119012901.0190408e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056422252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoleng.2017.01.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Xiaohong10aDominating aquatic macrophytes for the removal of nutrients from waterways of the Indian River Lagoon basin, South Florida, USA  ap. 107-119.  aAquatic macrophytes have an important role in cleaning eutrophic runoff water from agriculture and urban areas. However, minimal information is available regarding the quantity of nutrients and/or pollutant they can remove each year from the water and sediments in waterways. This study investigated the biomass productivity of eight dominating aquatic plant species, the concentrations of nutrients in plant tissues and their capacity to absorb and store nutrients. Samples of plant, water, and sediment were collected from October 30 to November 19, 2014 at 22 representative sites in the waterways of the Indian River Lagoon basin, South Florida, USA. The biomass yield of the plant species decreased in the order: cattail (Typha orientalis)> pickerelweed (Pontederia cordata)> water lettuce (Pistia stratiotes)> hydrilla (Hydrilla verticillata)> maidencane (Panicum hemitomon)> spatterdock (Nuphar advena)> pondweed (Potamogeton spp.)> salvinia (Salvinia spp.). Cattail had the highest biomass productivity, but only a small part (35.8%) of the total biomass productivity was harvestable, whereas, water lettuce and hydrilla were mostly harvestable and could contribute almost 100% to harvestable biomass. Concentration of nutrients in plant varied significantly among the eight plant species and with the sampling sites, suggesting that in addition to genetic differences, physicochemical parameters of overlying water and surface sediment influenced uptake of nutrients by the plants. Among the eight plant species, cattail had the highest total nitrogen (N) (23.4gNm−2) and phosphorus (P) (1.59gPm−2) storage but water lettuce and hydrilla exhibited the highest total N (14.6gNm−2) and P (1.04gPm−2) net storage capacity in this survey. In addition, the highest N and P uptake per year occurred with water lettuce and hydrilla, with the peak of 146kgNha−1y−1 and 10.4kgPha−1y−1, respectively. The results also indicate that multiple harvests of biomass are necessary to realize the removal potential of nutrients/pollutant by the aquatic plants, as the harvesting (cutting) practice can enhance plant growth and prevent release of nutrients/pollutant back into water from plant residue decomposition, which are estimated at 1.87×103 to 72.4×103kgN and 0.07×103 to 4.80×103kg P per year in the IRL basin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHydrilla verticillata 3aNuphar 3aPanicum hemitomon 3aPistia stratiotes 3aPontederia cordata 3aPotamogeton 3aSalvinia 3aTypha orientalis 3abasins 3abiomass production 3acleaning 3acutting 3aeutrophication 3agenetic variation 3aharvesting 3amacrophytes 3anitrogen content 3anutrient uptake 3anutrients 3aphosphorus 3aphysicochemical properties 3aplant growth 3aplant residues 3aplant tissues 3apollutants 3arunoff 3asediments 3asurveys 3aurban areas 3awaterways 3aFlorida 0aAquatic plants 0aNitrogen 0aPhosphorus 0aUptake 0aNutrients storage 0aHarvesting1 aHe, Zhenli1 aJones, Kimberly D.1 aLi, Liguang1 aStoffella, Peter J.0 tEcological engineering.g2017 Apr., v. 101 p.107-119dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11630x0925-85747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2017.01.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02225naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001500153245016100168520122100329592002801550653000901578653002601587653001101613653003501624653001101659700001601670700001701686700001701703773010601720856008801826852000901914655001201923IND60656037620221116141512.0200106e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065603762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.marpolbul.2019.1105062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWan, Zheng10aDo ship emission control areas in China reduce sulfur dioxide concentrations in local air? A study on causal effect using the difference-in-difference model  aAs a global factory and trade power, China has paid a high ecological price. Heavy shipping traffic is observed around the nation's most highly populated areas, including the Yangtze River Delta (YRD), Pearl River Delta (PRD), and Bohai Rim (BR) regions. Among the various shipping pollutants, sulfur dioxide (SO₂) has received increased attention because of its significant adverse health effects. China delimited three emission-control areas (ECAs) in three key waters of these regions to control the sulfur emissions from ships and improve the air-quality in China's coastal areas. Using the difference-in-difference model, this study determines that the ECA policy has a positive impact on reduction of SO₂ concentrations in the YRD and BR regions. The results of this study show that the ECA policy has some time lag, possibly because enforcement has gradually become more stringent. Surprisingly, the ECA policy does not play a positive role in reducing the SO₂ concentration in the PRD region. This lack of response could be caused by a series of measures that have been implemented before implementing the ECA policy in the PRD to reduce the impact of ship pollutant emissions on the local air quality.  aPublisher supplied data 0aShip 0aEmission-control area 0aSulfur 0aDifference-in-difference model 0aPolicy1 aZhou, Xujun1 aZhang, Qiang1 aChen, Jihong0 tMarine pollution bulletin.g2019 Dec., v. 149 p.110506-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12420x0025-326X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2019.1105063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03444naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245016000171520187500331592002802206650002602234650002902260650001602289650001402305650001202319650001802331650001102349650001702360650004102377650001102418650001802429650001002447650001402457650003302471650001902504650003202523650001102555650002302566650001002589650001102599700002002610700001902630700002102649700002702670700002402697773012502721856008302846852000902929655001202938IND60670049020221122065307.0190925e20190720xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067004902DNAL7 a10.3390/fermentation50300662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBraschi, Giacomo 10aMannoprotein Content and Volatile Molecule Profiles of Trebbiano Wines Obtained by <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> and <i>Saccharomyces bayanus</i> Strains  aThe production of volatile compounds has become one of the major technological features for yeast selection. In fact, although the aromatic profile of the wine is the sum of varietal-, pre-, post-, and fermentative-aroma compound, yeasts affect the quality of the grape from maturation throughout fermentation, metabolizing sugars and other components into alcohols, esters, organic acids, and aldehydes. Among the new technological features, the production of mannoproteins has gained interest. From this perspective, the main aim of this work was to characterize 9 strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and 1 of Saccharomyces bayanus for their volatile profiles and the release of mannoproteins. The strains were inoculated in Trebbiano musts and incubated at 15 &deg;C; at the end of fermentation the wines were evaluated by GC/MS/SPME for their volatile profiles and mannoprotein content by enzymatic assay. The strains were inoculated at level ranging between 4.9 and 6.3 log CFU/mL but only the strains L318 and 12233X6167 were able to reach values of 7.5 log CFU/mL. The aromatic profiles resulted in a strain-specific fingerprinting. According to the principal component analysis, the wines produced by the strains L288, L234, and L318 were characterized by the presence of propanoic acid, butanol, octanoic acid, and 3 methyl pentanol while the wine obtained by the strain 12233x35G2 was characterized by the presence of propanoic acid, butanol, octanoic acid and 3 methyl pentanol while the strain 12233x35G2 was characterized by the presence of decanoic acid ethyl ester, heptanoic acid ethyl ester, and acetic acid 2 phenetyl ester. Regarding mannoproteins, the highest concentration was achieved by strain12233x6167 (104 mg/L). The data allowed to select the strains endowed with the best fermentation performances in terms of aroma and mannoproteins release.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSaccharomyces bayanus 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aacetic acid 3aaldehydes 3abutanol 3adecanoic acid 3aesters 3afermentation 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3agrapes 3aoctanoic acid 3aodors 3apentanols 3aprincipal component analysis 3apropionic acid 3asolid phase microextraction 3asugars 3avolatile compounds 3awines 3ayeasts1 aRicci, Arianna 1 aGrazia, Luigi 1 aVersari, Andrea 1 aPatrignani, Francesca 1 aLanciotti, Rosalba 0 tFermentation.g2019 July 20, v. 5, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26730x2311-56377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/fermentation50300663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02371naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245007100163300001300234520124600247592002801493650003301521650002301554650001501577650001501592650001601607650001301623653002001636653003001656653002401686653001401710653002501724653002501749700001501774773011701789856008201906852000901988655001201997IND60603554620221119221115.0180716e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060355462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.csda.2015.01.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Zhao10aKappa statistic for clustered physician–patients polytomous data  ap. 1-17.  aMotivated by the recent advances in the kappa statistic for the clustered physician–patients dichotomous data, we extend the development for the polytomous data. For the clustered physician–patients polytomous data, based on its special correlation and covariance structure, we propose a simple and efficient data generation algorithm, and develop a semi-parametric variance estimator for the kappa statistic. An extensive Monte Carlo simulation study is then conducted to evaluate the performance of empirical coverage probability of the new proposal and alternative methods. The method ignoring dependence within a cluster underestimates the variance, and the variance estimators from new proposal and sampling-based delta method behave reasonably well for at least a moderately large number of clusters (e.g., K≥50). Moreover, the new proposal has acceptable performance when the number of clusters is small (e.g., K=25), although we need to be cautious about some bias concerns of the kappa statistic when the within-physician correlation is large as ρw>0.5. To illustrate the practical application of all the methods, a physician–patients data example from the Enhancing Communication and HIV Outcomes (ECHO) study is analyzed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHuman immunodeficiency virus 3aMonte Carlo method 3aalgorithms 3acovariance 3aprobability 3avariance 0aKappa statistic 0aClustered polytomous data 0aConfidence interval 0aAgreement 0aCoverage probability 0aPhysician–patients1 aZhou, Ming0 tComputational statistics & data analysis.g2015 July, v. 87 p.1-17dElsevier B.V.wJournal:3109x0167-94737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.csda.2015.01.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02719naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002300143245009500166300001600261520137500277592002801652650002001680650000801700650001001708650001201718650001901730650002501749650001401774650001001788650001301798653001101811653001501822653001801837653001301855653000901868700001801877700002601895700001901921700002301940700002301963700001801986700002102004700002102025773010502046856007702151852000902228655001202237IND60555433020221118010610.0161028e20160811xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055543302DNAL7 a10.1139/cjb-2016-00642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGernandt, David S.10aPhylogenetics of extant and fossil Pinaceae: methods for increasing topological stability1  ap. 863-884.  aRelationships of living and fossil Pinaceae were inferred using parsimony and Bayesian inference of morphological characters and plastid and nuclear DNA sequences. When considering extant taxa only, adding molecular to morphological characters resulted in markedly increased resolution and branch support compared with analysis of morphology alone. Including 45 fossil taxa resulted in drastically decreased resolution in morphology-based consensus trees. We evaluated the effect on branch support and resolution of including DNA sequences, deleting fossils lacking information for cone scale apices and seeds, using reduced consensus methods, and using implied weighting, and found that the greatest improvements were found by including DNA sequences and using implied weighting. The tree topologies from parsimony and Bayesian inference confirm previous findings that the fossil genus Pseudoaraucaria and a few species of Pityostrobus from the Lower Cretaceous are related to abietoid genera, and that other species of Pityostrobus are pinoid and closely related to Pinus. Focusing phylogenetic analyses on the most complete fossil cones, specifically those that are anatomically preserved and include both cone scale apices and seeds, and taking into account homoplasy, resulted in the clearest hypotheses for the timing and sequence of diversification in the family.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aDNA 3aPinus 3afossils 3anuclear genome 3anucleotide sequences 3aphylogeny 3aseeds 3atopology 0afossil 0amorphology 0aphylogenetics 0aPinaceae 0aPHYP1 aHolman, Garth1 aCampbell, Christopher1 aParks, Matthew1 aMathews, Sarah Y.,1 aRaubeson, Linda A.1 aListon, Aaron1 aStockey, Ruth A.1 aRothwell, Gar W.0 tBotany.g2016 Aug. 11, v. 94, no. 9 p.863-884dNRC Research PresswJournal:jnl44657x1916-28047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjb-2016-00643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03149naa a2200721 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005800147245007200205300001600277520129600293592002801589650003801617650003001655650001201685650001601697650001801713650001001731650001001741650001601751650001001767650001801777650001601795650001701811650001501828650001001843650001301853650001201866650001501878651001101893651001801904653001501922653001801937653002001955653000901975653001201984653001701996653000702013653001102020653000702031653000902038653000802047653000802055653001002063653000802073653001002081653000802091653000902099653000802108653000802116653001102124700002002135700002002155700001702175700002002192773011202212856008202324852000902406655001202415IND60568047620221122055352.0190401e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056804762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fct.2017.04.0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBastaki, Maria1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4487-115010aLack of genotoxicity in vivo for food color additive Allura Red AC  ap. 308-314.  aAllura Red AC is an approved food color additive internationally with INS number 129, in the United States as food color subject to batch certification “Food, Drug, and Cosmetic” (FD&C) Red No. 40, and in Europe as food color additive with E number 129. In their evaluation of the color (2013), the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) expressed concerns of potential genotoxicity, based primarily on one genotoxicity study that was not conducted according to Guidelines. The present in vivo genotoxicity study was conducted according to OECD Guidelines in response to EFSA's request for additional data. The animal species and strain, and the tissues examined were selected specifically to address the previously reported findings. The results show clear absence of genotoxic activity for Allura Red AC, in the bone marrow micronucleus assay and the Comet assay in the liver, stomach, and colon. These data addressed EFSA's concerns for genotoxicity. The Joint WHO/FAO Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) (2016) also reviewed the study and concluded that there is no genotoxicity concern for Allura Red AC. Negative findings in parallel genotoxicity studies on Tartrazine and Ponceau 4R (published separately) are consistent with lack of genotoxicity for azo dyes used as food colors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFood and Agriculture Organization 3aWorld Health Organization 3aanimals 3abone marrow 3acertification 3acolon 3acolor 3acomet assay 3adrugs 3afood coloring 3afood safety 3agenotoxicity 3aguidelines 3aliver 3amutagens 3astomach 3atartrazine 3aEurope 3aUnited States 0aFood color 0aAllura Red AC 0aFD&C Red no. 40 0aE129 0aINS 129 0aGenotoxicity 0aCP 0aEUEFSA 0aEU 0aFD&C 0aGLP 0aINS 0aJECFA 0aMMS 0aMnPCE 0aNCE 0aOECD 0aPCE 0aSCF 0aUS FDA1 aFarrell, Thomas1 aBhusari, Sachin1 aPant, Kamala1 aKulkarni, Rohan0 tFood and chemical toxicology.g2017 July, v. 105 p.308-314dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl33424x0278-69157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fct.2017.04.0373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03350naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001600155245014000171520170600311592002802017650001602045650002202061650001202083650001802095650002002113650001502133650001102148650001502159650002602174650000902200650002002209650001402229650000902243650001802252650002102270650001902291650002302310653002402333653002702357653003102384653003002415653002902445700001602474700001502490700001402505700001402519700002302533700001302556700001202569700001302581773009102594856009002685852000902775655001202784IND60684078020221119050544.0210212e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068407802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.1261152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTong, Lizhi10aEvaluation of the BCR sequential extraction scheme for trace metal fractionation of alkaline municipal solid waste incineration fly ash  aThe BCR sequential extraction scheme (SES), initially developed for soils and sediments, is frequently adopted to evaluate the environmental risks of municipal solid waste incineration (MSWI) fly ash. Within the procedure, metals are liberated from the matrix hosting them relying on the selectivity of the chosen chemical reagents or operation conditions. However, the effect of the high content of alkaline substances in MSWI fly ash on the selectivity of acetic acid to acid-soluble fraction metals was ignored. In this study, the feasibility of the BCR SES for evaluating MSWI fly ash was assessed by adjusting the acetic acid washing times in the acid-soluble extraction step. The metal fractionation, as well as mineralogy, morphology, and surface chemistry of the residues after three successive acid washing processes, were analyzed. The results reveal that only easily soluble salts, but not hydroxides, are entirely extracted after the first acid washing (pH∼12.0). Importantly, carbonates (generally reported as an indicator of the complete release of acid-soluble metals) are mostly decomposed only after the third acid washing (pH∼3.8). The incomplete dissolution of calcium carbonates in a single-step acid washing may convey misleading results of metal fractionation and underestimates the environmental risk of potentially toxic elements. Therefore, complete removal of carbonates should be employed as the endpoint of the acid-soluble fraction extraction step in the evaluation of MSWI fly ash. This work can help in selecting proper strategies for fly ash management and developing proper sequential extraction schemes for similar high-alkalinity hazardous waste risk assessment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetic acid 3acalcium carbonate 3afly ash 3afractionation 3ahazardous waste 3ahydroxides 3ametals 3amineralogy 3amunicipal solid waste 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3asediments 3asoil 3asoluble salts 3atoxic substances 3atrace elements 3awaste incineration 0aIncinerator fly ash 0aChemical fractionation 0aHazardous waste management 0aPotentially toxic element 0aEnvironmental assessment1 aHe, Jinyong1 aWang, Feng1 aWang, Yan1 aWang, Lei1 aTsang, Daniel C.W.1 aHu, Qing1 aHu, Bin1 aTang, Yi0 tChemosphere.g2020 June, v. 249 p.126115-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.1261153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02535naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002300149245009800172520120600270592002801476650002901504650001701533650002601550650001701576650001601593650001701609650002101626650002601647650002801673650001301701650001901714650002301733650001501756650001001771650001101781700002301792700002301815700002301838700002301861773012501884856008302009852000902092655001202101IND60670049320221122065259.0190925e20190727xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067004932DNAL7 a10.3390/fermentation50300692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorgan, Sydney  C.10aResponse to Sulfur Dioxide Addition by Two Commercial <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> Strains  aSulfur dioxide (SO<inf>2</inf>) is an antioxidant and antimicrobial agent used in winemaking. Its effects on spoilage microorganisms has been studied extensively, but its effects on commercial Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains, the dominant yeast in winemaking, require further investigation. To our knowledge, no previous studies have investigated both the potential SO<inf>2</inf> resistance mechanisms of commercial yeasts as well as their production of aroma-active volatile compounds in response to SO<inf>2</inf>. To study this, fermentations of two commercial yeast strains were conducted in the presence (50 mg/L) and absence (0 mg/L) of SO<inf>2</inf>. Strain QA23 was more sensitive to SO<inf>2</inf> than Strain BRL97, resulting in delayed cell growth and slower fermentation. BRL97 exhibited a more rapid decrease in free SO<inf>2</inf>, a higher initial production of hydrogen sulfide, and a higher production of acetaldehyde, suggesting that each strain may utilize different mechanisms of sulfite resistance. SO<inf>2</inf> addition did not affect the production of aroma-active volatile compounds in QA23, but significantly altered the volatile profiles of the wines fermented by BRL97.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aacetaldehyde 3aanti-infective agents 3aantioxidants 3acell growth 3afermentation 3ahydrogen sulfide 3aresistance mechanisms 3aspoilage microorganisms 3asulfites 3asulfur dioxide 3avolatile compounds 3awinemaking 3awines 3ayeasts1 aHaggerty, Jade  J.1 aJohnston, Britney 1 aJiranek, Vladimir 1 aDurall, Daniel  M.0 tFermentation.g2019 July 27, v. 5, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26730x2311-56377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/fermentation50300693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02672naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003400151245012000185300001600305520083800321592002801159650002101187650002501208650001001233650002601243650002901269650001701298650001501315650002201330650003701352650001601389653002501405653001801430653002501448653003301473700004901506700003701555700003601592700003801628700003501666700002501701700002601726700002701752700002501779700002301804700003701827700003601864773014701900856008602047852000902133655001202142IND60759221220221118205046.0220715e20211102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075922122DNAL7 a10.1080/22311866.2021.19873222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ada Silva, Rakel Olinda Macedo10aPotentiation of the Antibiotic Activity by the Essential Oils of Eugenia brasiliensis Lam. and Piper mosenii C.

Here, we use spatially explicit coalescence simulations to explore the properties of the island and the two‐dimensional stepping stone models under a wide range of scenarios with spatio‐temporal variation in deme size. We avoid the simulation of genetic data, using the fact that under the studied models, summary statistics of genetic diversity and divergence can be approximated from coalescence times. We perform the simulations using gridCoal, a flexible spatial wrapper for the software msprime (Kelleher et al., 2016, Theoretical Population Biology, 95, 13) developed herein. In gridCoal, deme sizes can change arbitrarily across space and time, as well as migration rates between individual demes. We identify different factors that can cause a deviation from theoretical expectations, such as the simulation time in comparison to the effective deme size and the spatio‐temporal autocorrelation across the grid. Our results highlight that FST, a measure of the strength of population structure, principally depends on recent demography, which makes it robust to temporal variation in deme size. In contrast, the amount of genetic diversity is dependent on the distant past when Nₑ is large, therefore longer run times are needed to estimate Nₑ than FST. Finally, we illustrate the use of gridCoal on a real‐world example, the range expansion of silver fir (Abies alba Mill.) since the last glacial maximum, using different degrees of spatio‐temporal variation in deme size.  aPublisher supplied data  a704172cH2020 Marie Skłodowska‐Curie Actions  aCRSK‐3\_190288cSchweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung  cSwiss National Science Foundation  cHorizon 2020  cEuropean Union  cIST Austria 3aAbies alba 3aautocorrelation 3acomputer software 3ademography 3agenetic variation 3apopulation genetics 3apopulation size 3apopulation structure 3atemporal variation1 aTrubenová, Barbora1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6873-29671 aCsilléry, Katalin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0039-92960 tMolecular ecology resources.g2022 Nov., v. 22, no. 8 p.2941-2955dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:12383x1755-098X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1755-0998.136763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03799naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100005200145245015500197300001800352500002000370520162500390592002802015596006702043596005502110596004702165650004902212650001802261650002202279650002202301650002902323650001302352650001202365650001802377650001202395650001102407650001002418650001302428650001102441650001502452650001502467650002102482650004102503650002602544700005302570700005802623700005402681700005402735700005602789700005502845700005202900700005402952773012603006856008003132852000903212655001203221IND60795224520221120143321.0221003e202211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079522452DNAL7 a10.1111/1755-0998.136752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFan, Wei1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5036-873314aThe genomes of chicory, endive, great burdock and yacon provide insights into Asteraceae palaeo‐polyploidization history and plant inulin production  ap. 3124-3140.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aInulin is an important reserve polysaccharide in Asteraceae plants, and is also widely used as a sweetener, a source of dietary fibre and prebiotic. Nevertheless, a lack of genomic resources for inulin‐producing plants has hindered extensive studies on inulin metabolism and regulation. Here, we present chromosome‐level reference genomes for four inulin‐producing plants: chicory (Cichorium intybus), endive (Cichorium endivia), great burdock (Arctium lappa) and yacon (Smallanthus sonchifolius), with assembled genome sizes of 1.28, 0.89, 1.73 and 2.72 Gb, respectively. We found that the chicory, endive and great burdock genomes were shaped by whole genome triplication (WGT‐1), and the yacon genome was shaped by WGT‐1 and two subsequent whole genome duplications (WGD‐2 and WGD‐3). A yacon unique whole genome duplication (WGD‐3) occurred 5.6–5.8 million years ago. Our results also showed the genome size difference between chicory and endive is largely due to LTR retrotransposons, and rejected a previous hypothesis that chicory is an ancestor of endive. Furthermore, we identified fructan‐active‐enzyme and transcription‐factor genes, and found there is one copy in chicory, endive and great burdock but two copies in yacon for most of these genes, except for the 1‐FEH II gene which is significantly expanded in chicory. Interestingly, inulin synthesis genes 1‐SST and 1‐FFT are located close to each other, as are the degradation genes 1‐FEH I and 1‐FEH II. Finally, we predicted protein structures for 1‐FFT genes to explore the mechanism determining inulin chain length.  aPublisher supplied data  cAgricultural Science and Technology Innovation Program of CAAS  aZDSYS20141118170111640cKey Laboratory of Shenzhen  cThe Elite Young Scientists Program of CAAS 3a1,2-beta-D-fructan 1(F)-fructosyltransferase 3aArctium lappa 3aCichorium endivia 3aCichorium intybus 3aSmallanthus sonchifolius 3aancestry 3achicory 3adietary fiber 3aecology 3aendive 3agenes 3agenomics 3ainulin 3ametabolism 3aprebiotics 3aretrotransposons 3asucrose:sucrose fructosyltransferase 3atranscription factors1 aWang, Sen1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9793-44721 aWang, Hengchao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8754-41951 aWang, Anqi1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9367-25241 aJiang, Fan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1359-09701 aLiu, Hangwei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4931-13071 aZhao, Hanbo1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9371-777X1 aXu, Dong1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6180-182X1 aZhang, Yan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2281-78070 tMolecular ecology resources.g2022 Nov., v. 22, no. 8 p.3124-3140dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:12383x1755-098X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1755-0998.136753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01993naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245010600171300001600277520095200293592002801245650002501273650002001298650002601318650001301344650001301357650001201370650001701382650001001399650001401409650001201423651001401435773010401449856008101553852000901634655001201643IND60621291320221118110126.0181116e200806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062129132DNAL7 a10.1007/s12355-008-0030-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumarasinghe, N.

The analysis of results showed that the treatments of Prince 18 kg/h, 22.5kg/h and Regent 1L/h are significantly effective in controlling of C. saccharphagus. Moreover, it was determined that Prince 18 kg/h and Regent 1.25L/h enhanced the weight (yield) of sugarcane by increasing the number of tillers. Therefore, with regard to maximum control and the maximum yield, Fipronil in its granular form of Prince at the recommended dosage of 18K/h is more suitable for controlling of the internode borer Chilo sacchariphagus.

The absence of saucer-nests in all mesocosms throughout the study indicates that longfin dace can spawn over cobble substrate and have larvae hatch successfully, suggesting that longfin dace can use an alternate spawning strategy when sand substrate is not available for construction of saucer-nests.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgosia chrysogaster 3aadults 3alarvae 3arivers 3asand 3aspawning 3astreams 3atemperature 3aNew Mexico1 aWhitney, James E.1 aGido, Keith B.0 tSouthwestern naturalist.g2014 June, v. 59, no. 2 p.277-280dThe Southwestern Association of Naturalists Southern Illinois University Edwardsvillex0038-49097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1894%2FN03-MP-09.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02195naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002400142245013300166300001600299520075000315592002801065650002001093650002801113650001801141650001101159650001101170650000901181650002301190650001301213650001801226650002001244650001401264650002201278650001401300650001901314650001501333650001601348651001301364700002501377700002101402700002301423700002401446773016801470856007801638852000901716655001201725IND60130560820221119055052.0151127e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013056082DNAL7 a10.1894/N04-CMW-01.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMontgomery, Chad E.10aNatural history of the black-chested spiny-tailed iguanas, Ctenosaura melanosterna (Iguanidae), on Cayo Cochnino Menor, Honduras  ap. 280-285.  aWe examined aspects of natural history and ecology of the black-chested spiny-tailed iguana, Ctenosaura melanosterna, on Cayo Cochino Menor, Honduras, over 6 years to provide baseline data to assist in management of this critically endangered species. Size of territory is resource-dependent, and the species seems to prefer habitats with open canopy. Mating occurred between March and June, with emergence of hatchlings from June to August. Ctenosaura melanosterna is an omnivore that feeds on a variety of vegetation, invertebrates, vertebrates, and food-scraps. The threats to this population include predation by Boa constrictor, competition with an increasing population of Iguana iguana, and potential poaching of adults and eggs for food.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBoa constrictor 3aCtenosaura melanosterna 3aIguana iguana 3aadults 3acanopy 3aeggs 3aendangered species 3ahabitats 3ainvertebrates 3anatural history 3aomnivores 3apopulation growth 3apredation 3aterritoriality 3avegetation 3avertebrates 3aHonduras1 aPasachnik, Stesha A.1 aRuyle, Leslie E.1 aFrazier, Julius A.1 aGreen, Steven E.

We used hydroponic plant cultures to study nanoparticle–plant-root interaction and translocation and exposed wheat and pumpkin to suspensions of uncoated CeO2–NP for 8d (primary particle size 17–100nm, 100mgL−1) in the absence and presence of fulvic acid (FA) and gum arabic (GA) as representatives of different types of natural organic matter. The behavior of CeO2–NPs in the hydroponic solution was monitored regarding agglomeration, sedimentation, particle size distribution, surface charge, amounts of root association, and translocation into shoots. NP-dispersions were stable over 8d in the presence of FA or GA, but with growing plants, changes in pH, particle agglomeration rate, and hydrodynamic diameter were observed. None of the plants exhibited reduced growth or any toxic response during the experiment. We found that CeO2–NPs translocated into pumpkin shoots, whereas this did not occur in wheat plants. The presence of FA and GA affected the amount of CeO2 associated with roots (pure>FA>GA) but did not affect the translocation factor. Additionally, we could confirm via TEM and SEM that CeO2–NPs adhered strongly to root surfaces of both plant species.  aPublisher supplied data 3afulvic acids 3agum arabic 3ahydrodynamics 3ahydroponics 3ananoparticles 3apH 3aparticle size 3aparticle size distribution 3apumpkins 3arisk assessment 3aroots 3ashoots 3atoxicity 3awheat 0aNanoparticles 0aPlant uptake 0aCerium oxide 0aOrganic matter1 aSchulin, R.q(Rainer),1 aLimbach, Ludwig K.1 aStark, Wendelin1 aBürge, Diane1 aNowack, Bernd0 tChemosphere.g2013 Apr., v. 91 p.512-520dElsevier Ltdx0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2012.12.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03226naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006100139245018000200500002000380520189700400592002802297650002802325650000902353650001102362650001502373650001302388650002502401650002402426650001302450650001502463650001002478650001102488650002202499650001002521651001302531700002302544700001902567700002002586773011502606856007402721852000902795655001202804IND60794425620221122025950.0220922e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079442562DNAL7 a10.1111/lre.124152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMequanent, Dagnew1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4985-831010aSpawning migration of Labeobarbus species of Lake Tana across the Gilgel Abay River Weir, Ethiopia: The challenges to fish spawning migration and proposed management solutions  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aLake Tana is one of the largest freshwater bodies in East Africa, with its 18 Labeobarbus species being the world's last remaining Cyprinid species flock. Many of them feed and grow in Lake Tana and migrate to the tributaries of the lake to reproduce. The construction of irrigation structures is increasing in the tributary rivers, however, without due attention being given to the spawning migration routes and critical spawning habitats. The present study examined the impacts of the Gilgel Abay Weir on the spawning migration of these species and discusses possible interactions with other human‐related impacts and potential mitigation measures. Fish samples were taken twice monthly from July to November 2019, both below and above the weir with gillnets. No spawning migration to the upstream of the weir has occurred since its construction, with the weir being a barrier to their spawning migration route of Lake Tana fisheries. Of the 11 species caught, only Labeobarbus intermedius (a habitat generalist) was observed above the weir, with the species diversity being significantly higher below the weir (p < 0.05) than above it. The total number of species observed during the present study was also lower, compared with previous reports. The fisheries impacts may also have been exacerbated by other contributing factors such as habitat destruction, river system degradation, destructive fishing practices and weed infestation, a situation which may lead to the collapse of Lake Tana fisheries and ultimately the lake's ecology. Reversing this situation is crucial, noting the implementation of such measures as habitat restoration and improvement, replacing the weir with environmentally friendly technologies, prohibition of illegal fishing, and construction of fish ladders could definitely alleviate the observed negative impacts of the Gilgel Abay Weir on the fisheries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLabeobarbus intermedius 3afish 3aflocks 3afreshwater 3agillnets 3ahabitat conservation 3ahabitat destruction 3ahabitats 3airrigation 3alakes 3arivers 3aspecies diversity 3aweeds 3aEthiopia1 aMingist, Minwyelet1 aAbebe Getahun,1 aAnteneh, Wassie0 tLakes & reservoirs.g2022 Sept., v. 27, no. 3 p.e12415-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:2144x1320-53317nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/lre.124153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01644naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245010400163300001600267520060700283592002800890650001900918650002200937650001600959650001200975650001200987650001100999650002201010700002101032700001901053700001901072700002001091773012601111856004801237852000901285655001201294IND4487498420221120052914.0120713e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448749842DNAL7 a10.1134/S10623590120400612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMazei, Yu.

However, as the disease progresses, activated microglia appear to become incapable of clearing Aβ deposits. Because repeated exposure to a TLR4 ligand leads to a diminished response of monocytes/macrophages to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and because aggregated Aβ is a TLR4 ligand, we hypothesize that chronic exposure of microglia to Aβ deposits may induce a state of Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling dysfunction, leading to decreased Aβ clearance and accelerated disease progression. LPS or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was injected into the hippocampus of AD-model (TgAPP/PS1) and wild-type (non-Tg) mice before and after the onset of Aβ deposition, at age 2 and 12 months, respectively. Brain specimens were collected 7 days post-injection and analyzed for microglial activation and Aβ load. While LPS-injected 2-month-old non-Tg mice showed 48-fold and 11-fold greater Iba1 immunoreactivity in the neocortex and hippocampus, respectively, compared with PBS-injected mice, LPS-injected 2-month-old TgAPP/PS1 mice had 61-fold and 13-fold increases in the neocortex and hippocampus, respectively. LPS injection activated microglia more strongly in TgAPP/PS1 mice than in non-Tg mice at 2 months of age. In contrast, at 12 months of age, Iba1 immunoreactivity of microglia was increased 541-fold and 38-fold in the neocortex and hippocampus, respectively, in LPS-injected non-Tg mice and 2.7-fold and 3.3-fold in the neocortex and hippocampus, respectively, in LPS-injected TgAPP/PS1 mice. Surprisingly, LPS injection decreased CD45 immunoreactivity in TgAPP/PS1 mice but increased it in non-Tg mice at 12 months. Although microglia in 12-month-old non-Tg mice showed stronger response to LPS than 2-month-old non-Tg mice, microglia in TgAPP/PS1 mice exhibited diminished immune response to LPS during aging. Our data indicate that microglial TLR4 signaling is altered in an AD mouse model and suggest that altered TLR4 signaling may contribute to Aβ accumulation in the brain.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAlzheimer disease 3aToll-like receptor 4 3aamyloid 3aanimal models 3achronic exposure 3adisease course 3ahippocampus 3aimmune response 3aligands 3alipopolysaccharides 3amacrophages 3amice 3amonocytes 3aneocortex 3aneuroglia 3apathogenesis 0aAlzheimer's disease 0aMicroglia 0aAmyloid 0aToll-like receptor 0aAnimal model 0aLipopolysaccharide1 aKou, Jinghong1 aLim, Jeong-Eun1 aYang, Junling1 aFukuchi, Ken-ichiro1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0009-17850 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2016 Oct. 14, v. 479 p.331-337dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2016.09.0733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02810naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004300113040001800156100001600174245018200190300001600372520115000388592002801538650003001566650001901596650000901615650001601624650001801640650001801658650002101676650002601697650000901723650001501732650003001747650004001777650002801817650003501845650002101880650002601901650005301927650003701980653001102017653001202028653003602040653000702076653001802083700001702101773007602118856008902194852000902283655001202292IND60112186320221117235240.0160901e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011218632DNAL7 a233578652pmid7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2012.12.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Woo-Mi10aEffects of zinc oxide and titanium dioxide nanoparticles on green algae under visible, UVA, and UVB irradiations: No evidence of enhanced algal toxicity under UV pre-irradiation  ap. 536-544.  aSome metal oxide nanoparticles are photoreactive, thus raising concerns regarding phototoxicity. This study evaluated ecotoxic effects of zinc oxide nanoparticles and titanium dioxide nanoparticles to the green algae Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata under visible, UVA, and UVB irradiation conditions. The nanoparticles were prepared in algal test medium, and the test units were pre-irradiated by UV light in a photoreactor. Algal assays were also conducted with visible, UVA or UVB lights only without nanoparticles. Algal growth was found to be inhibited as the nanoparticle concentration increased, and ZnO NPs caused destabilization of the cell membranes. We also noted that the inhibitory effects on the growth of algae were not enhanced under UV pre-irradiation conditions. This phenomenon was attributed to the photocatalytic activities of ZnO NPs and TiO2 NPs in both the visible and UV regions. The toxicity of ZnO NPs was almost entirely the consequence of the dissolved free zinc ions. This study provides us with an improved understanding of toxicity of photoreactive nanoparticles as related to the effects of visible and UV lights.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSelenastrum capricornutum 3acell membranes 3aions 3airradiation 3ananoparticles 3aphototoxicity 3atitanium dioxide 3aultraviolet radiation 3azinc 3azinc oxide 2aChlorophytaxdrug effects 2aNanoparticlesxchemistryxtoxicity. 2aPhotochemical Processes 2aTitaniumxchemistryxtoxicity. 2aUltraviolet Rays 2aWaste Disposal, Fluid 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxchemistryxtoxicity. 2aZinc Oxidexchemistryxtoxicity. 0aZnO NP 0aTiO2 NP 0aPseudokirchneriella subcapitata 0aUV 0aVisible light1 aAn, Youn-Joo0 tChemosphere.g2013 Apr., v. 91 p.536-544dElsevier Ltdx0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2012.12.0333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01919naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001600138245008800154300001600242500001100258520095500269592002801224650001201252650001601264650001101280650001901291650001501310651001001325651001701335700002101352773013801373856007301511852000901584655001201593IND60791940320221116143044.0220902e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079194032DNAL7 a10.1002/fee.25002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Wenjing10aMinding the boundary: social–ecological contexts for fence ecology and management  ap. 405-412.  aREVIEW  aFencing is a globally ubiquitous yet largely underestimated human infrastructure. To date, most fencing‐related research and management has focused on its biophysical outcomes. However, fencing is often part of coupled human and natural systems, and inevitably affects social and ecological dynamics and the links between them. Drawing from three key case studies in the US, China, and South Africa, we delineate five social pathways through which fencing shapes social–ecological dynamics in a landscape. We show that the social functions and physical appearance of fencing conjointly form a positive feedback loop that stimulates the proliferation of fences across entire landscapes, rendering fencing a more impactful feature than expected from its ecological impacts alone. The emerging field of fence ecology and management must embrace the social–ecological complexities of fenced landscapes to minimize unanticipated social consequences.  aPublisher supplied data 3aecology 3aenvironment 3ahumans 3ainfrastructure 3alandscapes 3aChina 3aSouth Africa1 aHuntsinger, Lynn0 tFrontiers in ecology and the environment.g2022 Sept., v. 20, no. 7 p.405-412dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:23083x1540-92957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/fee.25003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03258naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245005200164300001600216520181800232592002802050650002802078650002202106650001702128650001002145650001902155650001802174650001102192650001702203650001802220650001502238650001602253650001602269653002102285653001702306653001802323653003102341653001502372700001702387700001702404700001802421700001302439700001702452700001602469700005802485773011402543856008602657852000902743655001202752IND60687877320221117213624.0200523e20200610xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068787732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jconrel.2020.03.0432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Yuan10aCan machine learning predict drug nanocrystals?  ap. 274-285.  aNanocrystals have exhibited great advantage for enhancing the dissolution rate of water insoluble drugs due to the reduced size to nanoscale. However, current pharmaceutical approaches for nanocrystals formulation development highly depend on the expert experience and trial-and-error attempts which remain time and resource consuming. In this research, we utilized machine learning techniques to predict the particle size and polydispersity index (PDI) of nanocrystals. Firstly, 910 nanocrystal size data and 341 PDI data by three preparation methods (ball wet milling (BWM) method, high-pressure homogenization (HPH) method and antisolvent precipitation (ASP) method) were collected for the construction of the prediction models. The results demonstrated that light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM) exhibited well performance for the nanocrystals size and PDI prediction with BWM and HPH methods, but relatively poor predictions for ASP method. The possible reasons for the poor prediction refer to low quality of data because of the poor reproducibility and instability of nanocrystals by ASP method, which also confirm that current commercialized products were mainly manufactured by BWM and HPH approaches. Notably, the contribution of the influence factors was ranked by the LightGBM, which demonstrated that milling time, cycle index and concentration of stabilizer are crucial factors for nanocrystals prepared by BWM, HPH and ASP, respectively. Furthermore, the model generalizations and prediction accuracies of LightGBM were confirmed experimentally by the newly prepared nanocrystals. In conclusion, the machine learning techniques can be successfully utilized for the predictions of nanocrystals prepared by BWM and HPH methods. Our research also reveals a new way for nanotechnology manufacture.  aPublisher supplied data 3aartificial intelligence 3acommercialization 3adata quality 3adrugs 3ahomogenization 3amanufacturing 3amodels 3ananocrystals 3aparticle size 3aprediction 3astabilizers 3awet milling 0aMachine learning 0aNanocrystals 0aParticle size 0aPolydispersity index (PDI) 0aPrediction1 aYe, Zhuyifan1 aLiu, Xinyang1 aWei, Zhengjie1 aQiu, Fen1 aLi, Haifeng,1 aZheng, Ying1 aOuyang, Defang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8052-47730 tJournal of controlled release.g2020 June 10, v. 322 p.274-285dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12462x0168-36597nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2020.03.0433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02371naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002100138245010200159300001600261500001100277520108400288592002801372596005101400650002601451650001701477650001601494650001201510650001401522650001601536650001201552650001001564650001001574650001901584650001501603700001901618700002201637700001801659700001801677700002201695773013801717856007301855852000901928655001201937IND60791940520221116143025.0220902e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079194052DNAL7 a10.1002/fee.25082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMills, Nathaniel12aA tale of two whales: applying digital imaging and 3D printing to cetacean research and education  ap. 422-430.  aREVIEW  aEmerging technologies are changing how scientists and the public see and interact with cetacean specimens. As staff at a small, rural, marine science center, we employed LIDAR (light detection and ranging), x‐ray, computational tomography, and structured light scanning along with three‐dimensional (3D) printing to study and exhibit the remains of a 7.9‐m transient male killer whale (Orcinus orca) and a 22.4‐m female blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus). In collaboration with larger institutions, we applied these technologies to bone replication, skeletal articulation, soft‐tissue anatomical studies, and digital modeling to create high‐quality specimen replicas. These techniques surpass traditional modeling and restoration methods, and advance specimen‐associated research and documentation. In addition, 3D technology supports education and public awareness through in‐person and online exhibits and demonstrations. The decreasing cost and increasing appeal of advanced imaging can be used to enhance community engagement and the accessibility of science.  aPublisher supplied data  a#1817597cUS National Science Foundation (NSF) 3aBalaenoptera musculus 3aOrcinus orca 3aX-radiation 3aecology 3aeducation 3aenvironment 3afemales 3alidar 3amales 3amarine science 3atomography1 aSemans, Sheila1 aFlannery, Maureen1 aSquire, Crans1 aGrimes, Sarah1 aJacobsen, Jeffrey0 tFrontiers in ecology and the environment.g2022 Sept., v. 20, no. 7 p.422-430dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:23083x1540-92957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/fee.25083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02281naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024002200116024001900138040001800157100002400175245008100199300001400280520114300294592002801437650001101465650002001476650001601496650001701512650002001529650002501549650001201574773014901586856006801735856009601803990002301899852000901922655001201931IND60643219420221122114115.0190510e20090804xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064321942DNAL7 a10.3791/15142doi7 aPMC31499112pmcid7 a196845622pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCupp-Enyard, Carrie10aUse of the protease fluorescent detection kit to determine protease activity  ap. e1514.  aThe Protease Fluorescent Detection Kit provides ready-to-use reagents for detecting the presence of protease activity. This simple assay to detect protease activity uses casein labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) as the substrate. Protease activity results in the cleavage of the FITC-labeled casein substrate into smaller fragments, which do not precipitate under acidic conditions. After incubation of the protease sample and substrate, the reaction is acidified with the addition of trichloroacetic acid (TCA). The mixture is then centrifuged with the undigested substrate forming a pellet and the smaller, acid soluble fragments remaining in solution. The supernatant is neutralized and the fluorescence of the FITC-labeled fragments is measured. The described kit procedure detects the trypsin protease control at a concentration of approximately 0.5 μg/ml (5 ng of trypsin added to the assay). This sensitivity can be increased with a longer incubation time, up to 24 hours. The assay is performed in microcentrifuge tubes and procedures are provided for fluorescence detection using either cuvettes or multiwell plates.  aPublisher supplied data 3acasein 3aenzyme activity 3afluorescein 3afluorescence 3aisothiocyanates 3atrichloroacetic acid 3atrypsin0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2009 Aug. 04, , no. 30 p.e1514-e1514dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/15143Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/1514/use-protease-fluorescent-detection-kit-to-determine-protease  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03618naa a2200709 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002000166245010500186300001600291520149500307592002801802650002101830650002501851650001301876650001501889650002201904650002101926650001201947650001401959650001501973650001901988650001602007650001502023650001302038650002102051650002902072650001702101650002102118650003702139650001202176650002602188650002402214650001702238650002102255650003002276650001302306650003302319650002302352650002402375650002702399650003602426650001902462650002802481650002402509650002202533650003302555650001902588700001602607700001602623700001802639700001802657700001702675773011402692856008102806852000902887655001202896IND50072810120221119214448.0150212e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007281012DNAL7 a241226642pmid7 a10.1007/s12010-013-0534-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPham, L.

Their catalytic properties were fully characterized through various analyses including steady-state kinetic, direct oxidation of lignin macromolecules and their respective stabilities during the polymerization reactions. The analysis results proved that the 74th residue on the CWPO-C surface plays an important role in catalyzing the macromolecules via supposed ET mechanism. By comparing the residual activities of wild-type CWPO-C and mutant 74W CWPO-C after 3 min, mutation of tyrosine 74 residue to tryptophan increased the radical resistance of peroxidase up to ten times dramatically while maintaining its capability to oxidize lignin macromolecules. Furthermore, extension of poly(catechin) as well as lignin macromolecules with CWPO-C Y74W mutant clearly showed that this radical-resistant peroxidase mutant can increase the molecular weight of various kinds of polyphenolics by using surface-located active site. The anti-oxidation activity of the synthesized poly(catechin) was confirmed by xanthine oxidase assay. The elucidation of a uniquely catalytic mechanism in CWPO-C may improve the applicability of the peroxidase/H₂O₂catalyst to green polymer chemistry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aantioxidant activity 3acatechin 3acell walls 3aelectron transfer 3amolecular weight 3amutants 3aoxidation 3aperoxidase 3apolymerization 3apolyphenols 3atryptophan 3atyrosine 3axanthine oxidase 2aAntioxidantsxmetabolism 2aBiocatalysis 2aCatalytic Domain 2aCatechinxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aCations 2aCell Wallxenzymology 2aChromatography, Gel 2aDimerization 2aEnzyme Stability 2aFree Radicalsxmetabolism 2aKinetics 2aMolecular Docking Simulation 2aMutationxgenetics 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aPeroxidasexmetabolism 2aPhenolsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aPolymerization 2aPolyphenolsxmetabolism 2aPopulusxenzymology 2aSpectrophotometry 2aStructural Homology, Protein 2aThermodynamics1 aKim, S.

While the Eurasian falcon is considered a common and numerous species in Slovakia, the red-footed falcon population has undergone a considerable decline during the past few decades. Nowadays it nests in a single locality in Slovakia, the Sysľovské polia Special Protection Area, which forms the northern and fragmented border of the species distribution area in Europe. By analysing prey remains from 9 nests (from 1998, 2001, 2013, 2014 and 2016), we identified 433 prey items belonging to 35 taxa and 9 orders. Every year, invertebrates made up the major part of the diet spectrum, in which Calosoma auropunctatum, Tettigonia viridissima, Zabrus tenebrioides, Anisoplia aegetum and Rhizotrogus sp. were the most frequent species of prey. Of the vertebrates, Microtus arvalis was the most hunted prey species. By supplementary analysis of 21 photos, we extended our knowledge on the diet by other 6 taxa. The peak of the M. arvalis population growth in 2014 did not manifest itself in the red-footed falcon diet composition. In 1998, 2014 and 2016 we also studied the diet of a syntopical species, the Eurasian kestrel. By analysing prey remains in 22 nests, we identified 1,151 prey items belonging to 37 taxa and 7 orders. In 1998 and 2014 vertebrates predominated, especially the common vole, however in 2016 invertebrates prevailed. This fact could be a reaction to the M. arvalis population peak in 2014 and its decline in 2016. These results suggest that this variability in the foraging behaviour of the Eurasian kestrel, an opportunistic predator, during the hunting of invertebrates increases the diet similarity and overlapping of the food niche of both studied falcon species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCalosoma 3aFalco tinnunculus 3aMicrotus arvalis 3aRhizotrogus 3aTettigonia viridissima 3aZabrus 3adecline 3adiet 3afalcons 3ageographical distribution 3apopulation growth 3aprey species 3aSlovakia 0ared-footed falcon 0aEurasian kestrel 0aforaging 0ainsectivory 0acentral Europe1 aSlobodník, Roman1 aLangraf, Vladimír1 aNoga, Michal1 aKrumpálová, Zuzana1 aŠustek, Zbyšek,1 aKrištín, Anton,0 tSlovak raptor journal.g2017 Dec. 1, v. 11, no. 1 p.15-30dDe Gruyter OpenwJournal:23175x1338-72277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/srj-2017-00063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03215naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245009300156520183000249592002802079650003702107650001602144650000802160650001802168650001802186650001002204650003402214650001902248650001002267650003102277650002002308650001602328650001802344650000902362650001802371700002002389700002302409700002102432700002702453700002502480700002102505700001702526773012002543856007302663852000902736655001202745IND60702970020221118043116.0200719e20200611xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070297002DNAL7 a10.3390/f110606662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHumar, Miha 10aQuality Control of Thermally Modified Timber Using Dynamic Vapor Sorption (DVS) Analysis  aThe importance of thermal modification is increasing worldwide. Increased use of thermally modified timber (TMT) has resulted in a need for reliable quality control, comprising control of variation of the production within defined limits, allowing third-party control in the case of certification and the regulation of customer complaints and claims. Techniques are thus needed to characterise the modification of quality in terms of improved target properties of TMT during industrial production, and of TMT products that have been in service for an arbitrary time. In this study, we aimed to utilise dynamic vapor sorption (DVS) for this purpose. Norway spruce (Picea abies) and European beech (Fagus sylvatica) samples were thermally modified at different temperatures according to different heat treatment techniques: (1) the Silvapro process based on an initial vacuum; (2) an air heat treatment, whereby samples were wrapped in aluminium foil; (3) thermal modification of wood samples in the ambient atmosphere in a laboratory oven. Wood samples from closed processes were analysed for validation. TMT was characterised with respect to mass loss, colour and density. Mass loss of wood due to modification (MLTM) was correlated with factors derived from DVS analysis. The present DVS measurements suggest that the equilibrium wood moisture content (EMC₉₅% RH), the time to reach 10% wood moisture content (t₁₀% MC), and the elongation factor, c, derived from a logarithmic function, can serve as alternative parameters to characterise the quality of several thermal modification processes. Further studies are recommended using other wood species, different modification processes and further parameters gained from DVS measurements to understand the robustness and the predictive power of the applied technique.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFagus sylvatica subsp. sylvatica 3aPicea abies 3aair 3aaluminum foil 3acertification 3acolor 3adynamic vapor sorption method 3aheat treatment 3aovens 3apeptide elongation factors 3aquality control 3atemperature 3awater content 3awood 3awood moisture1 aRepič, Rožle 1 aKržišnik, Davor 1 aLesar, Boštjan 1 aCerc Korošec, Romana 1 aBrischke, Christian 1 aEmmerich, Lukas 1 aRep, Gregor 0 tForests.g2020 June 11, v. 11, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f110606663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01694naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245010400167300001600271520055400287592002800841650002400869650002000893650001800913650002400931650001300955650001400968650001300982650002700995650002201022700002401044700001701068700001901085700001901104773010401123856008401227852000901311655001201320IND60093985820221120174905.0141104e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009398582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.copbio.2010.11.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFarre, Gemma10aNutritionally enhanced crops and food security: scientific achievements versus political expediency  ap. 245-251.  aGenetic engineering (GE) is one of a raft of strategies that can be used to tackle malnutrition.

We quantified the annual rates of aboveground net primary production (ANPP) over a five-year period for two forests, an upland mixed forest and a seasonally flooded cerrado forest, located in the northern Pantanal region of Brazil. We hypothesized that rates of ANPP would be higher for the mixed forest than the cerrado forest because seasonal flooding can limit rates of tree growth. ANPP was calculated as the sum of the annual litter production measured from litterfall traps and the stem growth increment measured from dendrometers and tree density. ANPP varied between 3.8–5.5 MgC ha⁻¹ y⁻¹ for the flooded forest and 1.6–4.6 MgC ha⁻¹ y⁻¹ for the upland forest. Litter production accounted for 57% of the ANPP, and the difference in ANPP between the upland and flooded forests was due to consistently higher litter production in the flooded forest. Annual variations in ANPP were not correlated with annual precipitation, presumably because the hydrology of these sites is driven more by the flood stage of the Cuiaba River than by local precipitation. However, consistent declines in forest floor litter mass occurred at both sites, suggesting that C storage may be responding to some unknown disturbance that occurred prior to our sampling campaign. Seasonal variation in rainfall exerted an important control on litter production dynamics, with leaf litter production increasing during the dry season and stem and reproductive litter production increasing during the wet season. While there are few studies of seasonally flooded tropical forests, our data suggest that the seasonally flooded and upland forests of the northern Pantanal can act as appreciable aboveground C sinks.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acarbon sequestration 3acarbon sinks 3acerrado 3adendrometers 3adry season 3aforest litter 3ahighlands 3ahydrology 3amixed forests 3anet primary productivity 3arain 3arivers 3asavannas 3aseasonal variation 3astem elongation 3atraps 3atree growth 3atrees 3atropical forests 3aupland forests 3awet season 3aBrazil 3aPantanal1 aMarques, Ana  Carolina Amorim1 aVourlitis, George  L.0 tForests.g2020 June 11, v. 11, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f110606653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03412naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245012900158300001800287500002000305520140600325592002801731596011701759596006401876596007401940596006902014650000802083650001702091650002602108650001702134650001702151650001802168650003502186650001302221650000902234650002202243650001202265650001502277700005702292700001702349700001702366700001902383700001502402700001402417700001202431700001602443700001402459700001202473700001802485700006002503700005602563773013202619856007402751852000902825655001202834IND60794426420221122041649.0220922e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079442642DNAL7 a10.1111/pbi.138822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Yanchang10aEfficient assembly of long DNA fragments and multiple genes with improved nickase‐based cloning and Cre/loxP recombination  ap. 1983-1995.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aFunctional genomics, synthetic biology and metabolic engineering require efficient tools to deliver long DNA fragments or multiple gene constructs. Although numerous DNA assembly methods exist, most are complicated, time‐consuming and expensive. Here, we developed a simple and flexible strategy, unique nucleotide sequence‐guided nicking endonuclease (UNiE)‐mediated DNA assembly (UNiEDA), for efficient cloning of long DNAs and multigene stacking. In this system, a set of unique 15‐nt 3′ single‐strand overhangs were designed and produced by nicking endonucleases (nickases) in vectors and insert sequences. We introduced UNiEDA into our modified Cre/loxP recombination‐mediated TransGene Stacking II (TGSII) system to generate an improved multigene stacking system we call TGSII‐UNiE. Using TGSII‐UNiE, we achieved efficient cloning of long DNA fragments of different sizes and assembly of multiple gene cassettes. Finally, we engineered and validated the biosynthesis of betanin in wild tobacco (Nicotiana benthamiana) leaves and transgenic rice (Oryza sativa) using multigene stacking constructs based on TGSII‐UNiE. In conclusion, UNiEDA is an efficient, convenient and low‐cost method for DNA cloning and multigene stacking, and the TGSII‐UNiE system has important application prospects for plant functional genomics, genetic engineering and synthetic biology research.  aPublisher supplied data  a2019TQ05N147cGuangdong special support program of young top‐notch talent in science and technology innovation  aNT2021002cLaboratory of Lingnan Modern Agriculture Project  a2019B030302006cMajor Program of Guangdong Basic and Applied Research  a31991222; 31971915cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aDNA 3aDNA assembly 3aNicotiana benthamiana 3aOryza sativa 3abiosynthesis 3abiotechnology 3agenetically modified organisms 3agenomics 3arice 3asynthetic biology 3atobacco 3atransgenes1 aHan, Jingluan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9070-25371 aTan, Jiantao1 aYang, Yaqian1 aLi, Shuangchun1 aGou, Yajun1 aLuo, Yuyu1 aLi, Tie1 aXiao, Wenyu1 aXue, Yang1 aHao, Yu1 aXie, Xianrong1 aLiu, Yao‐Guang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9201-29971 aZhu, Qinlong1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7622-64500 tPlant biotechnology journal.g2022 Oct., v. 20, no. 10 p.1983-1995dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3774064x1467-76447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/pbi.138823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01587naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245005400174300001600228520063200244592002800876650001500904650001300919650002200932650002700954650001600981650001600997650001301013650002101026700001701047773010401064856008401168852000901252655001201261IND60093986120221118174340.0141104e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009398612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.copbio.2010.11.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 avan der Veen, Stijn10aBacterial SOS response: a food safety perspective  ap. 136-142.  aThe SOS response is a conserved inducible pathway in bacteria that is involved in DNA repair and restart of stalled replication forks.

The inter‐kingdom gene transfer capability made Agrobacterium an essential tool and model system to study the mechanism of exporting and integrating a segment of bacterial DNA into the plant genome. However, many biological processes such as Agrobacterium‐host recognition and interaction are still elusive. To accelerate the understanding of this important plant pathogen and further improve its capacity in plant genetic engineering, we adopted a CRISPR RNA‐guided integrase system for Agrobacterium genome engineering. In this work, we demonstrate that INsertion of Transposable Elements by Guide RNA–Assisted TargEting (INTEGRATE) can efficiently generate DNA insertions to enable targeted gene knockouts. In addition, in conjunction with Cre‐loxP recombination system, we achieved precise deletions of large DNA fragments. This work provides new genetic engineering strategies for Agrobacterium species and their gene functional analyses.  aPublisher supplied data  aIOS‐1725122cNSF  aIOS‐1917138cNSF  cNational Science Foundation  cIowa State University 3aAgrobacterium radiobacter 3aDNA 3abiotechnology 3acrown galls 3agene transfer 3agenes 3aintegrases 3aplant pathogens1 aLee, Keunsub1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3174-24751 aWang, Kan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2474-58000 tPlant biotechnology journal.g2022 Oct., v. 20, no. 10 p.1916-1927dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3774064x1467-76447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/pbi.138723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02511naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100005400166245007100220300001300291520137700304592002801681650002301709650001501732650001001747650001401757650001701771650002101788653002401809653001601833653001501849653001601864653002001880653002501900773012201925856008102047852000902128655001202137IND60650567120221123022743.0190710e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065056712DNAL7 a301413832pmid7 a10.1017/S0022149X180007672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPoulin, R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1390-120610aBest practice guidelines for studies of parasite community ecology  ap. 8-11.  aIn recent decades, parasite community ecology has produced hundreds of studies on an ever-growing number of host species, and developed into an active sub-discipline of parasitology. However, this growth has been characterized by a lack of standards in the practices used by researchers, with many common approaches being flawed, unjustified or misleading. Here, in the hope of promoting advances in the study of parasite community ecology, I identify some of the most common errors or weaknesses in past studies, and propose ten simple rules for best practice in the field. They cover issues including, among others, taxonomic resolution, proper and justifiable analytical methods, higher-level replication, controlling for sampling effort or species richness, accounting for spatial distances, using experimental approaches, and placing raw data in the public domain. While knowledge of parasite communities has expanded in breadth, with more and more host species being studied, true progress has been very limited with respect to our understanding of fundamental general processes shaping these communities. It is hoped that the guidelines presented here can direct researchers away from the entrenched use of certain approaches flawed in design, analysis or interpretation, by offering a more rigorous and standardized set of practices, and, hopefully, a way forward.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical methods 3aguidelines 3ahosts 3aparasites 3aparasitology 3aspecies richness 0acommunity structure 0aexperiments 0ahypotheses 0areplication 0asampling effort 0ataxonomic resolution0 tJournal of helminthology.g2019 Jan., v. 93, no. 1 p.8-11dCambridge University PresswJournal:23124x1475-26977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0022149X180007673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02617naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006800150245009800218300001400316520111300330592002801443650001101471650001901482650002101501650002301522650002201545650002301567650001601590653002101606653002001627653001301647653001501660700002001675700006201695700006401757700002401821700002801845700006101873700006701934773008802001856008502089852000902174655001202183IND60772364420221119023346.0220719e20220815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077236442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2022.03.0592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGonçalves, Liliana P.L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5366-612710aUnderstanding the importance of N−doping for CNT-supported Ni catalysts for CO2 methanation  ap. 35-43.  aThe N−doping of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) is widely accepted as an effective way to enhance the catalytic performance of CNT-supported Ni catalysts for CO₂ methanation. To demonstrate, in a direct systematic comparison, the importance of N−doping for producing high-performance CO₂ methanation catalysts, we developed two catalysts composed of 15 wt% Ni on pristine (Ni/CNT) and N−doped CNT (Ni/CNT−N) and correlated their catalytic performance with their properties. Compared to Ni/CNT, Ni/CNT−N achieved a higher XCO₂ of 81.2% with SCH₄ = 99.2% at a lower temperature of 400 °C, exhibiting excellent stability over 48 h time-on-stream testing. Our comprehensive comparative study demonstrated that the N−doped CNT support featured a better distribution of the Ni sites that were strongly interacting with the support, even with atomically dispersed Ni being observed by HAADF-STEM. This higher dispersion, enabled by the anchoring sites provided by the N−doping, is one of the main reasons for the enhanced performance of Ni/CNT−N, because it increases the H₂ uptake capacity.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon nanotubes 3acatalytic activity 3acomparative study 3amethane production 3atemperature 0aCarbon nanotubes 0aCO2 methanation 0aN-doping 0aHAADF-STEM1 aMeledina, Maria1 aMeledin, Alexander1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3200-05531 aPetrovykh, Dmitri Y.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9089-40761 aSousa, Juliana P.S.1 aSoares, O.

Herein, we present a high‐quality, chromosome‐scale reference genome sequence of a tetraploid potato cultivar. The total length of this genome assembly was 2.67 Gb, with scaffold N50 and contig N50 sizes of 46.24 and 2.19 Mb, respectively. In total, 1.69 Gb repetitive sequences were obtained through de novo annotation, and long terminal repeats were the main transposable elements. A total of 126 070 protein‐coding genes were annotated, of which 125 077 (99.21%) were located on chromosomes. The 48 chromosomes were classified into four haplotypes. We annotated 31 506 homologous genes, including 5913 (18.77%) genes with four homologues, 11 103 (35.24%) with three homologues, 12 177 (38.65%) with two homologues and 2313 (7.34%) with one homologue. MLH3, MSH6/7 and RFC3, which are the genes involved in the mismatch repair pathway, were found to be significantly expanded in the tetraploid potato genome relative to the diploid potato genome. Genome‐wide association analysis revealed that cytochrome P450, flavonoid synthesis, chalcone enzyme, glycosyl hydrolase and glycosyl transferase genes were significantly correlated with the flesh colours of potato tuber in 150 tetraploid potatoes. This study provides valuable insights into the highly heterozygous autotetraploid potato genome and may facilitate the development of tools for potato cultivar breeding and further studies on autotetraploid crops.  aPublisher supplied data  a31660417cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aCARS‐9cChina Agriculture Research System of MOF and MARA  a2019‐NK‐A1cThe Science and Technology Department of Qinghai Province  a2020‐HZ‐806cThe Science and Technology Department of Qinghai Province  aKYQD(ZR)‐20101cThe Startup Fund of Hainan University 3aSolanum tuberosum 3aautotetraploidy 3abiotechnology 3achalcone 3acultivars 3acytochrome P-450 3adiploidy 3agenome 3agenome assembly 3agenome-wide association study 3aglycosidases 3ahaplotypes 3aheterozygosity 3anucleotide sequences 3apotatoes 3avegetative propagation 3aAndes region1 aXia, Zhiqiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1555-13371 aZou, Meiling1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2923-210X1 aZhao, Long1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1499-67131 aJiang, Sirong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1626-19561 aZhou, Yun1 aZhang, Chenji1 aMa, Yongzhen1 aBao, Yuting1 aSun, Haihong1 aWang, Wenquan1 aWang, Jian1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9120-88750 tPlant biotechnology journal.g2022 Oct., v. 20, no. 10 p.1996-2005dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3774064x1467-76447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/pbi.138833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02834naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150100001500168245006900183300001600252520140700268592002801675650001201703650002101715650002701736650002001763650001001783650002101793650001401814650001401828650001601842650001201858650003001870650002801900650000901928650002701937650001501964650002301979650002302002650002802025650004902053651001002102700002002112700002002132773009402152856008502246852000902331655001202340IND4475338120221117162001.0141110e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447533812DNAL7 a219459282pmid7 a10.1016/j.aquatox.2011.08.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Wei10aArsenic bioaccumulation in a marine juvenile fish Terapon jarbua  ap. 582-588.  aArsenic (As) is a ubiquitous toxic metalloid that is causing widespread public concern. Recent measurements have indicated that some marine fish in China might be seriously contaminated with As. Yet the biokinetics and bioaccumulation pathway of As in fish remain little understood. In this study, we employed a radiotracer technique to quantify the dissolved uptake, dietary assimilation and subsequent efflux of As(V) in a marine predatory fish, Terapon jarbua. The dissolved uptake of As showed a linear pattern over a range of dissolved concentrations from 0.5 to 50μgL⁻¹, with a corresponding uptake rate constant of 0.0015Lg⁻¹d⁻¹. The assimilation efficiencies (AEs) of dietary As were only 3.1–7.4% for fish fed with copepods, clams, prey fish, or artificial diets, and were much lower than the As that entered the trophically available metal fraction in the prey. The dietary AEs were independent of the As(V) concentrations in the artificial diets. The efflux rate constant of As in fish following the dietary exposure was 0.03d⁻¹. Modeling calculations showed that dietary uptake could be the primary route for As bioaccumulation in fish, and the corresponding contributions of waterborne and dietary uptakes were related to the bioconcentration factor (BCF) of the prey and the ingestion rate of fish. This study demonstrates that As(V) has a low bioavailability to T. jarbua.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarsenic 3aartificial diets 3abioaccumulation factor 3abioavailability 3aclams 3adietary exposure 3aingestion 3ajuveniles 3amarine fish 2aAnimals 2aArsenicxpharmacokinetics 2aBiological Availability 2aDiet 2aEnvironmental Exposure 2aFood Chain 2aFood Contamination 2aModels, Biological 2aPerciformesxmetabolism 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxpharmacokinetics 3aChina1 aHuang, Liangmin1 aWang, Wen-Xiong0 tAquatic toxicology.g2011 Oct., v. 105, no. 3-4 p.582-588dElsevier B.V.x0166-445X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2011.08.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03606naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100003500139245010700174520189300281592002802174650001202202650002902214650001702243650001802260650001802278650002202296650001902318650002202337650001502359650002002374650002102394650001102415650001502426650004302441650002202484650001902506650002402525650002102549650001702570651001302587700003202600700004102632700001802673700002102691700001902712700002702731700003002758700003702788700002502825773012002850856007302970852000903043655001203052IND60702970520221118043006.0200719e20200611xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070297052DNAL7 a10.3390/f110606702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWan Mohd Jaafar, Wan  Shafrina14aThe Influence of Deforestation on Land Surface Temperature—A Case Study of Perak and Kedah, Malaysia  aOver the past few decades, there has been a rapid change in forest and land cover, especially in tropical forests due to massive deforestation. The major factor responsible for the changes is to fulfill the growing demand of increasing population through agricultural intensification, rural settlements, and urbanization. Monitoring forest cover and vegetation are essential for detecting regional and global environmental changes. The present study evaluates the influence of deforestation on land surface temperature (LST) in the states of Kedah and Perak, Malaysia, between 1988 and 2017. The trend in forest cover change over the time span of 29 years, was analyzed using Landsat 5 and Landsat 8 satellite images to map the sequence of forest cover change. With the measurement of deforestation and its relationship with LST as an end goal, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was used to determine forest health, and the spectral radiance model was used to extract the LST. The findings of the study show that nearly 16% (189,423 ha) of forest cover in Perak and more than 9% (33,391 ha) of forest cover in Kedah have disappeared within these 29 years as a result of anthropogenic activities. The correlation between the LST and NDVI is related to the distribution of forests, where LST is inversely related to NDVI. A strong correlation between LST and NDVI was observed in this study, where the average mean of LST in Kedah (25 °C) is higher than in Perak (22.6 °C). This is also reflected by the decreased NDVI value from 0.6 to 0.5 in 2017 at both states. This demonstrated that a decrease in the vegetation area leads to an increase in the surface temperature. The resultant forest change map would be helpful for forest management in terms of identifying highly vulnerable areas. Moreover, it could help the local government to formulate a land management plan.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3aanthropogenic activities 3acase studies 3adeforestation 3aforest health 3aforest management 3aimage analysis 3aintensive farming 3aland cover 3aland management 3alocal government 3amodels 3amonitoring 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3apopulation growth 3aremote sensing 3asurface temperature 3atropical forests 3aurbanization 3aMalaysia1 aKhairul Nizam Abdul Maulud,1 aMuhmad Kamarulzaman, Aisyah  Marliza1 aRaihan, Asif 1 aMd Sah, Syarina 1 aAhmad, Azizah 1 aSaad, Siti  Nor Maizah1 aMohd Azmi, Ahmad  Tarmizi1 aJusoh Syukri, Nur  Khairun Ayuni1 aRazzaq Khan, Waseem 0 tForests.g2020 June 11, v. 11, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f110606703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03603naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002100138245014700159300001600306520193600322592002802258650002202286650001302308650001702321650001502338650002002353650001402373650001802387650001502405650001502420650001402435650001302449650002902462650001602491650001502507650003002522650002502552650001302577650001402590650001002604650001302614650002302627650001102650650001102661650002202672650001202694651001502706700002202721700002202743700002002765773016902785856007402954852000903028655001203037IND60130562120221119054737.0151127e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013056212DNAL7 a10.1894/FRG-05.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnderson, Ian J.10aDifferences in benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages associated with a bloom of Didymosphenia geminata in the Lower American River, California  ap. 389-395.  aDidymo (Didymosphenia geminata) is a freshwater colonial diatom native to northern latitude lakes and streams and, until recently, was considered indicative of high-altitude, low-temperature, nutrient-poor habitats experiencing little anthropogenic impact. In recent years, however, this diatom has expanded its geographic distribution into lower latitudes and altitudes. In early 2012, we discovered a bloom of didymo in the Lower American River below Nimbus Dam in Sacramento County, California. Due to production of large masses of extracellular stalks that can smother stream substrates, and its proximity to a salmonid habitat restoration project, discovery of didymo prompted us to conduct a study of its effects on benthic macroinvertebrates, an important food source for juvenile salmonids. In May and June 2012, we sampled benthic macroinvertebrates in a reach of the main channel where didymo was abundant and in a nearby reach on a side channel where environmental conditions were similar but didymo was seemingly rare or absent. We found significant differences in taxonomic composition and abundance of macroinvertebrates inhabiting the two reaches. Higher numbers of Chironomidae (midges), Gammaridae (scuds), Hirudinidae (leeches), Hydroptilidae (microcaddisflies), and total macroinvertebrates were recorded in the main channel. In contrast, higher numbers of Baetidae (baetid mayflies), Glossosomatidae (saddlecase caddisflies), and Tipulidae (crane flies), along with a higher percentage of combined Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera (%EPT), were recorded in the side channel. We also recorded higher values for three common measures of taxonomic diversity (Margalef richness, Pielou's evenness, Shannon-Wiener diversity) in the side channel. From these initial observations, we tentatively concluded that the didymo bloom has influenced benthic macroinvertebrate composition in the Lower American River.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillariophyceae 3aBaetidae 3aChironomidae 3aGammaridae 3aGlossosomatidae 3aHirudinea 3aHydroptilidae 3aPlecoptera 3aSalmonidae 3aTipulidae 3aaltitude 3aanthropogenic activities 3acrane flies 3afreshwater 3ageographical distribution 3ahabitat conservation 3ahabitats 3ajuveniles 3alakes 3alatitude 3amacroinvertebrates 3amidges 3arivers 3aspecies diversity 3astreams 3aCalifornia1 aSaiki, Michael K.1 aSellheim, Kirsten1 aMerz, Joseph E.0 tSouthwestern naturalist.g2014 Sept., v. 59, no. 3 p.389-395dThe Southwestern Association of Naturalists Southern Illinois University Edwardsvillex0038-49097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1894%2FFRG-05.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03003naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245008000156520178600236592002802022650001902050650002102069650002402090650002502114650001502139650001702154650002302171650001002194650001302204650002502217650001002242650001802252651001102270651001802281700002202299700001702321700002202338700001902360773012002379856007302499852000902572655001202581IND60702970620221118043217.0200719e20200612xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070297062DNAL7 a10.3390/f110606712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrglez, Ana 14aThe Effect of Eutypella parasitica on the Wood Decay of Three Maple Species  aEutypella parasitica R.W. Davidson & R.C. Lorenz is the causative agent of Eutypella canker of maple, a destructive disease of maples in Europe and North America. The fungus E. parasitica is known to cause wood stain and decay. However, it is not known how effectively it decomposes the wood of the most widespread maple species in Europe. Wood samples of Acer pseudoplatanus L., A. platanoides L., and A. campestre L. were exposed to four isolates of E. parasitica and nine other fungal species for comparison, according to the modified EN 113 standard. After 15 weeks of incubation, mass loss and microscopical analysis of samples showed evidence of colonization and different wood decay potentials among fungal species. A highly significant positive correlation was found between mass loss and moisture content for all fungal species. Similarly, the measured cell wall thickness correlated well with the calculated mass loss of the samples. On average, the fungal species caused the lowest mass loss in A. pseudoplatanus (10.0%) and the highest in A. campestre (12.6%) samples. Among the samples exposed to E. parasitica isolates, the highest mass loss was recorded in A. pseudoplatanus (6.6%). Statistical analysis showed significant differences in mass loss and moisture content between different E. parasitica isolates. Based on the results of staining, we discuss the type of decay caused by E. parasitica. Although E. parasitica isolates caused smaller mass loss of samples compared to other more effective decay species, we should not disregard its capability of degrading maple wood. Because E. parasitica usually infects the lower portion of the trunk, which is the largest and most valuable part of the tree, any damage can cause significant economic and resource loss.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcer campestre 3aAcer platanoides 3aAcer pseudoplatanus 3aEutypella parasitica 3acell walls 3adecayed wood 3aetiological agents 3afungi 3astaining 3astatistical analysis 3atrees 3awater content 3aEurope 3aNorth America1 aPiškur, Barbara,1 aHumar, Miha 1 aGričar, Jožica 1 aOgris, Nikica 0 tForests.g2020 June 12, v. 11, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f110606713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01964naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245015000161300001800311520075000329592002801079650001501107650000901122650002101131650001101152650001301163653001801176653002201194653002901216653001801245653003401263700001601297700001701313700002001330700002001350773012401370856007501494852000901569655001201578IND60527355820221123002142.0160715e20121128xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052735582DNAL7 a10.1021/am301589k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThomas, Joseph
P.10aNear-Surface Oxidized Sulfur Modifications and Self-Assembly of Thiol-Modified Aptamer on Au Thin Film Substrates Influenced by Piranha Treatment  ap. 5945-5948.  aSelf-assembly of thiol-modified oligonucleotides on Au films has great importance for biosensor applications. Prior to the self-assembly, a piranha treatment (PT) is commonly used to clean the Au surface. Here we report that near-surface oxidized sulfur modifications on Au thin films by PT for longer than 60 s have serious effects on the self-assembled monolayer (SAM) formation of thiol-modified single-stranded thrombin binding aptamer (s-TBA), and a PT time of 10–30 s is optimal for s-TBA SAM formation. These results have important implication to SAM formation of biomolecules, especially for the thiol-modified ones where a careful consideration of this key step could significantly enhance the SAM formation and biosensor performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiosensors 3agold 3aoligonucleotides 3asulfur 3athrombin 0aAu thin films 0apiranha treatment 0athrombin binding aptamer 0aself-assembly 0aoxidized sulfur modifications1 aZhao, Liyan1 aDing, Kejian1 aHeinig, Nina F.1 aLeung, Kam Tong0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2012 Nov. 28, v. 4, no. 11 p.5945-5948dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fam301589k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02401naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024002200116024001900138040001800157100002200175245016700197300001400364520112700378592002801505650002001533650002301553650003001576650001401606650001501620650001701635650001901652700001701671773014901688856006801837856010201905990002302007852000902030655001202039IND60643219920221122114156.0190510e20091008xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064321992DNAL7 a10.3791/15252doi7 aPMC31640692pmcid7 a198164002pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReinisch, Andreas10aIsolation and animal serum free expansion of human umbilical cord derived mesenchymal stromal cells (mscs) and endothelial colony forming progenitor cells (ecfcs)  ap. e1525.  aThe umbilical cord is a rich source for progenitor cells with high proliferative potential including mesenchymal stromal cells (also termed mesenchymal stem cells, MSCs) and endothelial colony forming progenitor cells (ECFCs). Both cell types are key players in maintaining the integrity of tissue and are probably also involved in regenerative processes and tumor formation. To study their biology and function in a comparative manner it is important to have both cells types available from the same donor. It may also be beneficial for regenerative purposes to derive MSCs and ECFCs from the same tissue. Because cellular therapeutics should eventually find their way from bench to bedside we established a new method to isolate and further expand progenitor cells without the use of animal protein. Pooled human platelet lysate (pHPL) replaced fetal bovine serum in all steps of our protocol to completely avoid contact of the cells to xenogeneic proteins. This video demonstrates a methodology for the isolation and expansion of progenitor cells from one umbilical cord. All materials and procedures will be described.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal proteins 3afetal bovine serum 3amesenchymal stromal cells 3aneoplasms 3astem cells 3atherapeutics 3aumbilical cord1 aStrunk, Dirk0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2009 Oct. 08, , no. 32 p.e1525-e1525dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/15253Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/1525/isolation-animal-serum-free-expansion-human-umbilical-cord-derived  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02982naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002400138245004700162300001600209520166400225592002801889650001801917650001401935650001201949650001301961650001501974650001101989650001502000650001702015650001002032650001302042650001102055650001502066650001402081650001602095650001702111650001302128650001402141651001202155700002202167700001802189700002302207700001802230773016902248856007402417852000902491655001202500IND60130562520221119054925.0151127e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013056252DNAL7 a10.1894/TAL-62.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNicholson, Kerry L.10aMountain lion habitat selection in Arizona  ap. 372-380.  aWildlife managers in the 21st century are challenged to maintain balance for wildlife and human use of the landscape. Because mountain lion (Puma concolor) habitat is often adjacent to urbanization in Arizona, mountain lions are ideal models to examine how human alteration of habitats influences life-history characteristics. We quantified mountain lion home-range characteristics and selection of vegetative associations in central and southern Arizona. We calculated 95% and 50% fixed kernel home ranges for eight female and 21 male mountain lions radiocollared in Payson, Prescott, and Tucson, Arizona, from August 2005 through August 2008. We assessed use of vegetative associations and urban areas within the study area (second order) and within the home range (third order). At both levels of selection at all study sites, mountain lions avoided human-dominated landscapes. At second-order selection, mountain lions preferred woodland habitat in Tucson and Prescott and chaparral in Payson. At the third order, lions in Tucson and Payson selected riparian and chaparral in Prescott. Season, mountain lion mass, and ungulate density had no effect on the size of home ranges. Home-range sizes for resident males ranged from 5,286 to 83,859 ha; transient males covered up to 409,195 ha. Home ranges for females ranged from 2,860 to 21,772 ha. Intensive development and conversion of large open spaces to small properties and subdivisions has caused increased loss, fragmentation, and encroachment into mountain lion habitat. Preserving natural landscapes for access to habitat patches is important in maintaining connectivity to ensure viable populations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPuma concolor 3achaparral 3afemales 3ahabitats 3ahome range 3ahumans 3alandscapes 3alife history 3amales 3amanagers 3amodels 3aopen space 3aungulates 3aurban areas 3aurbanization 3awildlife 3awoodlands 3aArizona1 aKrausman, Paul R.1 aSmith, Thorry1 aBallard, Warren B.1 aMcKinney, Ted0 tSouthwestern naturalist.g2014 Sept., v. 59, no. 3 p.372-380dThe Southwestern Association of Naturalists Southern Illinois University Edwardsvillex0038-49097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1894%2FTAL-62.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01767naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001600137245006500153300001500218500002000233520082100253592002801074650002701102650002101129650001101150650000901161650001601170700002401186700002101210773014201231856007101373852000901444655001201453IND60680283520221122234641.0200104e198302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068028352DNAL7 a10.2307/12403422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPope, Rulon10aEconomic Welfare Evaluations for Producers under Uncertainty  ap. 98-107.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe validity of producer and consumer surplus measures of firm welfare under risk is examined. Under constant absolute risk aversion and output price uncertainty only, these measures are an exact measure of firm welfare as defined by compensating variation, equivalent variation or the change in the certainty equivalent. Under decreasing absolute risk aversion, qualitative comparisons of various measures are discussed. For example, producer's surplus as measured by the area above the uncompensated risk averse supply curve overstates the compensating variation of a change in expected price of output. Procedures for calculating firm welfare under production uncertainty and a variety of economic environments are proposed. Generally, these procedures are applicable only when absolute risk aversion is constant.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural economics 3aconsumer surplus 3aprices 3arisk 3auncertainty1 aChavas, Jean‐Paul1 aJust, Richard E.0 tAmerican journal of agricultural economics.g1983 Feb., v. 65, no. 1 p.98-107dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl44932x0002-90927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2307/12403423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02167naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245005900175300001600234520089900250592002801149650001501177650002701192650001101219650002201230650001701252650000901269650002801278650001601306650002501322650001701347650001401364700002601378700002501404700002101429700002401450700002101474700002001495700002101515773010401536856008401640852000901724655001201733IND60093986720221118174404.0141104e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009398672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.copbio.2010.12.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLechardeur, Delphine10aUsing heme as an energy boost for lactic acid bacteria  ap. 143-149.  aLactic acid bacteria (LAB) are a phylogenetically diverse group named for their main attribute in food fermentations, that is, production of lactic acid. However, several LAB are genetically equipped for aerobic respiration metabolism when provided with exogenous sources of heme (and menaquinones for some species). Respiration metabolism is energetically favorable and leads to less oxidative and acid stress during growth. As a consequence, the growth and survival of several LAB can be dramatically improved under respiration-permissive conditions. Respiration metabolism already has industrial applications for the production of dairy starter cultures. In view of the growth and survival advantages conferred by respiration, and the availability of heme and menaquinones in natural environments, we recommend that respiration be accepted as a part of the natural lifestyle of numerous LAB.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerobiosis 3acultured milk starters 3aenergy 3aexogenous sources 3afermentation 3aheme 3aindustrial applications 3alactic acid 3alactic acid bacteria 3amenaquinones 3aphylogeny1 aCesselin, Bénédicte1 aFernandez, Annabelle1 aLamberet, Gilles1 aGarrigues, Christel1 aPedersen, Martin1 aGaudu, Philippe1 aGruss, Alexandra0 tCurrent opinion in biotechnology.g2011 Apr., v. 22, no. 2 p.143-149dElsevier Ltdx0958-16697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.copbio.2010.12.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04044naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002100141245008000162300001600242520225300258592002802511650002102539650002502560650001402585650001302599650001602612650001202628650001902640650001102659650002002670650001002690650001602700650001702716650001202733650001202745650001502757650001502772650001602787650001002803650001402813650001602827650001502843650001402858650001202872650001102884650001202895650001002907650000902917651001402926653001502940653002102955653001102976653002302987700002103010700002403031700002403055700002503079700002003104700002303124773013703147856007703284852000903361655001203370IND60131731520221117171407.0151127e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013173152DNAL7 a10.1638/2010-0154.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartino, Pablo E10aHematology and serum biochemistry of free-ranging nutria (myocastor coypus)  ap. 240-247.  aInformation onreference blood values in the literature is lacking for many wild rodents. In this study, comprehensive reference intervals (RIs) for a wide range of analytes from 101 healthy free-ranging nutria were determined. Animals were captured in Buenos Aires, Argentina (37°50′S, 57°34′W), and southward (38°60′S, 58°23′W), encompassing major biotopes of agricultural pampas with dunes and grassland steppes on the east coast. Traps were set at locations with high-density nutria populations (i.e., those areas that showed signs of movement, territorial marking, or feeding activities). Although the small sample size limits the interpretation of these findings, RIs were determined by a robust method using the central 95th percentile. In nutria, the RI range varied greatly for the leukocyte differentials, with mature neutrophils: 3,907–5,544/μl for females and 3,744–5,900/μl for males; band neutrophils: 0–10/μl for females and 3–18/μl for males; lymphocytes: 4,213–5,940/μl for both sexes combined; monocytes: 165–402/μl for both sexes combined; eosinophils: 13–91/μl for females and 108–165/μl for males; and basophils: 0–87/μl for both sexes combined. Platelet concentration was 543–727 × 10⁹/L for both sexes combined. There was also a wide RI range for biochemistry values for some enzymes, such as alkaline phosphatase: 200–399 IU/L for both sexes combined; cholinesterase: 762–1,407 IU/L for females and 763–1,284 IU/L for males; creatine kinase: 182–552 IU/L for females and 162–451 IU/L for males; amylase: 853–1,865 IU/L for females and 779–1,293 IU/L for males; and glucose concentration 120.2–180.6 mg/dl for both sexes combined. Conversely, there was not a wide pooled RI range for calcium: 7.0–11.2 mg/dl; phosphorous: 6.1–9.3 mg/dl; sodium: 133.0–159.0 mEq/L; potassium: 3.0–8.2 mEq/L; chloride: 101.4–143.0 mEq/L; and urea: 11.3–36.8 mg/dl.The red blood cell indices had a narrow range, with mean corpuscular volume: 84.0 −102.5 fl and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration: 18.2–28.8 g/dl, and which was most likely due to strict physiologic controls. The results from this study were similar to those previously reported for farmed nutria.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMyocastor coypus 3aalkaline phosphatase 3abasophils 3abiotopes 3ablood serum 3acalcium 3acholinesterase 3acoasts 3acreatine kinase 3adunes 3aeosinophils 3aerythrocytes 3afemales 3aglucose 3ahematology 3ahemoglobin 3alymphocytes 3amales 3amonocytes 3aneutrophils 3aphosphorus 3apotassium 3arodents 3asodium 3asteppes 3atraps 3aurea 3aArgentina 0aHematology 0aMyocastor coypus 0anutria 0aserum biochemistry1 aAráuz, Sandra M1 aAnselmino, Fernando1 aCisterna, Cecilia C1 aSilvestrini, Maria P1 aCorva, Santiago1 aHozbor, Federico A0 tJournal of zoo and wildlife medicine.g2012 June, v. 43, no. 2 p.240-247dAmerican Association of Zoo Veterinariansx1042-72607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1638%2F2010-0154.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02540naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245012500168300001400293520113200307592002801439650000901467650002601476650003701502650002101539650001201560650001601572650004801588650001801636650001401654651001201668653003201680653000901712653001801721653001401739653004101753700002501794700002901819700002101848700002001869773011301889856008302002852000902085655001202094IND60590756620221120220954.0180314e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059075662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mimet.2018.01.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKnaack, Dennis10aEvaluation of a novel optical assay for rapid detection of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in liquid culture  ap. 68-70.  aValid detection of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a precondition for MRSA prevention measures. Most of the available MRSA screening tests are based either on the identification of colony material grown on solid agar media or on direct molecular approaches. The HB&L MRSA KIT (Alifax, Polverara, Italy) is designed to screen for MRSA in liquid cultures applying the light scattering technology. Here, the assay was evaluated with pure culture isolates from solid agar media on a representative subset of 29 MRSA and 171 methicillin-susceptible S. aureus clinical strains from a German multicenter study reflecting the ratio of MRSA to MSSA in Germany. Additionally, 53 mecA/mecC-MRSA comprising hospital-, community and livestock-associated MRSA as well as 20 clinical coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) challenge strains were tested. Including the results of the assay-immanent confirmatory tests for positively tested strains, the sensitivity, specificity and the positive and negative predictive values were 100%. The methicillin-resistance was also correctly identified for all challenge strains.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagar 3aantibiotic resistance 3acoagulase negative staphylococci 3alight scattering 3aliquids 3amethicillin 3amethicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus 3arapid methods 3ascreening 3aGermany 0aLight scattering technology 0aMRSA 0aRapid testing 0aScreening 0aAntimicrobial susceptibility testing1 aIdelevich, Evgeny A.1 aKörber-Irrgang, Barbara1 aKresken, Michael1 aBecker, Karsten0 tJournal of microbiological methods.g2018 Mar., v. 146 p.68-70dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6372x0167-70127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mimet.2018.01.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02621naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245014200162300001800304520133900322592002801661650002201689650001001711650001401721650002701735650002301762650001901785650001301804650002901817650001301846650001501859650001301874650001301887650002501900650001601925650002201941700002401963700002401987773010402011856007502115852000902190655001202199IND60577720720221120182301.0170810e20120522xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057772072DNAL7 a10.1021/ma30065262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFukumaru, Takahiro10aExtremely High Thermal Resistive Poly(p-phenylene benzobisoxazole) with Desired Shape and Form from a Newly Synthesized Soluble Precursor  ap. 4247-4253.  aThe poly(p-phenylene benzobisoxazole) (PPBO) fiber, known as Zylon, has a very high thermal stability as well as mechanical strength when compared to any other polymers due to its ladder-like rigid structure. However, one of the critical drawbacks of its stiff structure is its insolubility in organic solvents, and only strong acids can be used use for fiber spinning of this polymer. To overcome the poor processability caused by this insolubility in organic solvents, a soluble PPBO precursor was designed and synthesized by the reaction of tert-butyldimethylsilyl (TBS) group-functionalized 4,6-diaminoresoisinol with terephthaloyl chloride for polycondensation. The obtained TBS-functionalized PPBO precursor (TBS-prePBO) shows an excellent solubility in common organic solvents, such as N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP), N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMAc), and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Transparent TBS-prePBO films made by the solution-cast method provided PPBO films after thermal treatment at 500 °C for 1 h. The structure of the obtained PPBO films was characterized by IR and XRD techniques and found that the films exhibited extremely high thermal stabilities, namely, the synthesized PPBO polymer decomposition temperature reached 670 °C in flowing N₂, which is the highest temperature among the organic polymers reported so far.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aacids 3achlorides 3acondensation reactions 3adimethyl sulfoxide 3aheat treatment 3anitrogen 3aorganochlorine compounds 3apolymers 3asolubility 3asolvents 3aspinning 3astrength (mechanics) 3atemperature 3athermal stability1 aFujigaya, Tsuyohiko1 aNakashima, Naotoshi0 tMacromolecules.g2012 May 22, v. 45, no. 10 p.4247-4253dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fma30065263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01891naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245009800172300001600270520086800286592002801154650001801182650002501200653002901225653002201254653004501276653003401321700002301355773012001378856008201498852000901580655001201589IND60603551520221119221522.0180716e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060355152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.csda.2014.10.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaronna, Ricardo A.10aHigh finite-sample efficiency and robustness based on distance-constrained maximum likelihood  ap. 262-274.  aGood robust estimators can be tuned to combine a high breakdown point and a specified asymptotic efficiency at a central model. This happens in regression with MM- and τ-estimators among others. However, the finite-sample efficiency of these estimators can be much lower than the asymptotic one. To overcome this drawback, an approach is proposed for parametric models, which is based on a distance between parameters. Given a robust estimator, the proposed one is obtained by maximizing the likelihood under the constraint that the distance is less than a given threshold. For the linear model with normal errors, simulations show that the proposed estimator attains a finite-sample efficiency close to one while improving the robustness of the initial estimator. The same approach also shows good results in the estimation of multivariate location and scatter.  aPublisher supplied data 3alinear models 3astatistical analysis 0aFinite-sample efficiency 0aRobust regression 0aRobust multivariate location and scatter 0aKullback–Leibler divergence1 aYohai, Víctor J.,0 tComputational statistics & data analysis.g2015 Mar., v. 83 p.262-274dElsevier B.V.wJournal:3109x0167-94737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.csda.2014.10.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02500naa a2200265 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075024005100099040001800150100002400168245008300192300001600275500000900291520158000300592002801880650002101908650002301929650001601952700002601968773012101994852000902115856009802124655001202222991579239990742620221122074101.0191122e197807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7891394212DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci1978.0011183X001800040010x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMokhtarzadeh, Ahmad10aPlant Regeneration from Hypocotyl- and Anther-Derived Callus of Berseem Clover  ap. 567-572.  aepub  aPlants were regenerated from hypocotyl and anther explains of berseem clover (Trifolium alexandrinum L.) on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium containing various combinations of plant growth regulators. The most efficient production of plants from hypocotyl explants involved: callus induction on MS medium with 1.0 mg/liter of naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) and 1.5 mg/liter 6-furfurylaminopurine (KIN); callus increase on MS medium with 2.0 mg/liter of NAA and 0.1 mg/liter of N⁶-(Δ²-isopentenyl) adenine (2iP); induction of shoots on MS medium with 0.5 mg/liter each of NAA and KIN followed by induction of roots on MS medium with 1.0 mg/liter of indoleacetic acid (IAA) and 0.1 mg/liter of 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP). Suspension cultures in liquid MS medium containing 2.0 mg/liter of NAA and 0.2 mg/liter of 2iP provided filterable cell preparations with 45% viable cells, 4% of which gave rise to colonies within 3 weeks after transfer to agar plates. Shoot development was observed when callus from the colonies was cultured on MS medium with 0.5 mg/liter of NAA and KIN. Twenty percent of uncontaminated anthers from a single plant cultured on MS medium containing 1.0, 0.1, and 0.01 mg/liter of NAA, 2,4-D, and 2iP, respectively, produced callus which could be maintained and from which plants could be regenerated by culturing on MS medium with 0.5 mg/liter each of NAA and KIN. Preliminary results indicate that cells of root tips from hypocotyl- and antherderived callus have the expected diploid and haploid number of chromosomes (2n = 16 and n = 8, respectively).  aPublisher supplied data 3aplant physiology 3aplant biochemistry 3afield crops1 aConstantin, Milton J.0 tCrop science.g1978 July, v. 18, no. 4 p.567-572dCrop Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44570x0011-183X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2135/cropsci1978.0011183X001800040010x3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02486naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100005900149245013500208300001400343520113200357592002801489650002901517650001701546650002101563650001201584650001501596650002401611650001501635650001501650650001501665650001101680653002101691653002801712653001601740653002101756653002901777700002801806700002501834773011301859856008301972852000902055655001202064IND60590756720221120220959.0180314e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059075672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mimet.2018.01.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaslanka, Roman1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1917-422210aAutofluorescence of yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells caused by glucose metabolism products and its methodological implications  ap. 55-60.  aAutofluorescence is the natural fluorescence emitted by cellular compounds which have light emission properties. The main examples of these compounds, identified as an endogenous fluorophores, include aromatic amino acids, vitamins, coenzymes and electron acceptors. As many of them play a critical role in cell metabolism, changes in their content may provide important information on the physiological status of the cell. Nevertheless, the simultaneous occurrence of different endogenous fluorophores in cells makes it difficult to interpret the autofluorescence signal. Autofluorescence values may also be imposed on values obtained through exogenous fluorescent dyes. This study evaluates the origin and the methodological implications of autofluorescence observed in yeast cells. The results show that the level of autofluorescence may differ between yeast cells, which are a result of different concentrations of endogenous fluorophores, including tryptophan, pyridoxine and riboflavin. The study also shows an important influence of autofluorescence on the results obtained by methods based on external fluorescent dyes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3afluorescence 3afluorescent dyes 3aglucose 3ametabolism 3aphysiological state 3apyridoxine 3ariboflavin 3atryptophan 3ayeasts 0aAutofluorescence 0aEndogenous fluorophores 0aCarbon flow 0aGlucose analogue 0aSaccharomyces cerevisiae1 aKwolek-Mirek, Magdalena1 aZadrag-Tecza, Renata0 tJournal of microbiological methods.g2018 Mar., v. 146 p.55-60dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6372x0167-70127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mimet.2018.01.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01746naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245017900159520046800338592002800806650001300834650001000847650001300857650001500870650002000885650001600905650001400921650002200935650001500957651001300972651001700985651000901002700002001011700002601031700002301057700002801080700002301108773012301131856007301254852000901327655001201336IND60670046220221122052839.0190925e20190826xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067004622DNAL7 a10.3390/d110901452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSanta-Cruz, Roy12aA New Species of Terrestrial-Breeding Frog (Amphibia, Strabomantidae, <em>Noblella</em>) from the Upper Madre De Dios Watershed, Amazonian Andes and Lowlands of Southern Peru  aWe describe and name a new species of Noblella Barbour, 1930 (Strabomantidae) from southern Peru.

Controlled reversible addition–fragmentation chain-transfer (RAFT) polymerization is employed to synthesize poly(N-isopropylacrylamide-b-2-(dimethylamino)ethyl acrylate) (PNIPAM-b-PDMAEA) diblock copolymers. The pH-dependent ionic complexation between the fluorescent protein, mCherry, and the ionic PDMAEA block is established using dynamic light scattering (DLS) and UV–vis spectroscopy. DLS shows that the size of the resulting coacervate micelles depends strongly on pH, while UV–vis spectroscopy shows a correlation between the protein’s absorption maximum and the ionic microenvironment. Zeta potential measurements clearly indicate the ionic nature of the complex-forming interactions. Spin-casting was used to prepare nanostructured films from the protein–block copolymer coacervates. After film formation, the lower critical solution temperature (LCST) of the PNIPAM blocks allows the nanomaterial to be effectively immobilized in aqueous environments at physiological temperatures, enabling potential use as a controlled protein release material or polymer matrix for protein immobilization. At pH 9.2 and 7.8, the release rates are at least 10 times faster than that at pH 6.4 due to weaker interaction between protein and PNIPAM-b-PDMAEA (PND) diblock copolymer. Because of the ionic environment in which protein is confined, the majority of the protein (80%) remains active, independent of pH, even after having been dehydrated in vacuum and confined in the films.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aabsorption 3acomposite polymers 3afluorescent proteins 3alight scattering 3amicelles 3ananomaterials 3apH 3apolymerization 3atemperature 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 3awater solubility 3azeta potential1 aLam, Christopher N.1 aOlsen, Bradley D.0 tMacromolecules.g2012 June 12, v. 45, no. 11 p.4572-4580dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fma20249143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02922naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245018000168300001800348520146600366592002801832650001601860650002501876650002101901650001701922650000901939650001201948650001301960650001801973650001201991650000902003650001102012650001802023653001702041653000802058653000802066653001502074700001302089700002402102700001902126700001902145700002402164700002302188773013902211856008102350852000902431655001202440IND60675923920221117172051.0191111e20191128xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067592392DNAL7 a10.1017/S00071145190019462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSprague, Matthew10aEndogenous production of n-3 long-chain PUFA from first feeding and the influence of dietary linoleic acid and the α-linolenic:linoleic ratio in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar)  ap. 1091-1102.  aAtlantic salmon (Salmo salar) possess enzymes required for the endogenous biosynthesis of n-3 long-chain PUFA (LC-PUFA), EPA and DHA, from α-linolenic acid (ALA). Linoleic acid (LA) competes with ALA for LC-PUFA biosynthesis enzymes leading to the production of n-6 LC-PUFA, including arachidonic acid (ARA). We aimed to quantify the endogenous production of EPA and DHA from ALA in salmon fed from first feeding on diets that contain no EPA and DHA and to determine the influence of dietary LA and ALA:LA ratio on LC-PUFA production. Salmon were fed from first feeding for 22 weeks with three diets formulated with linseed and sunflower oils to provide ALA:LA ratios of approximately 3:1, 1:1 and 1:3. Endogenous production of n-3 LC-PUFA was 5·9, 4·4 and 2·8 mg per g fish and that of n-6 LC-PUFA was 0·2, 0·5 and 1·4 mg per g fish in salmon fed diets with ALA:LA ratios of 3:1, 1:1 and 1:3, respectively. The ratio of n-3:n-6 LC-PUFA production decreased from 27·4 to 2·0, and DHA:EPA ratio increased and EPA:ARA and DHA:ARA ratios decreased, as dietary ALA:LA ratio decreased. In conclusion, with a dietary ALA:LA ratio of 1, salmon fry/parr produced about 28 μg n-3 LC-PUFA per g fish per d, with a DHA:EPA ratio of 3·4. Production of n-3 LC-PUFA exceeded that of n-6 LC-PUFA by almost 9-fold. Reducing the dietary ALA:LA ratio reduced n-3 LC-PUFA production and EPA:ARA and DHA:ARA ratios but increased n-6 LC-PUFA production and DHA:EPA ratio.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalmo salar 3aalpha-linolenic acid 3aarachidonic acid 3abiosynthesis 3adiet 3aenzymes 3afish fry 3alinoleic acid 3alinseed 3aparr 3asalmon 3asunflower oil 0aDesaturation 0aDHA 0aEPA 0aElongation1 aXu, Gong1 aBetancor, Monica B.1 aOlsen, Rolf E.1 aTorrissen, Ole1 aGlencross, Brett D.1 aTocher, Douglas R.0 tBritish journal of nutrition.g2019 Nov. 28, v. 122, no. 10 p.1091-1102dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl45200x1475-26627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00071145190019463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02503naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100001400148245010100162300001600263520123800279592002801517650001601545650002501561650001001586650001601596650002001612650001001632650002201642650001001664650002301674650001701697650001801714650004301732700001501775700001301790700001301803700001301816700001501829700001301844700001301857773009401870856008401964852000902048655001202057IND4460751720221119200853.0141112e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446075172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.livsci.2011.04.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCui, J.X.14aThe effects of DGAT1 and DGAT2 mRNA expression on fat deposition in fatty and lean breeds of pig  ap. 292-296.  aDiacylgycerol acyltransferase (DGAT) plays a key modulatory role in animal fat deposition. Intramuscular fat (IMF) content and backfat thickness (BFT) were important factors in establishing pork quality. Therefore, the objectives of the current study were to elucidate the relationship between DGAT mRNA expression with IMF content, BFT by quantitative real-time PCR in three important pig breeds, including Laiwu pig (LW, n=12, fatty), Lulai Black (LL, n=12) and Large White (LY, n=12, lean). A total of 36 pigs were castrated boars (114±2kg) and taken from longissimus dorsi muscle, backfat and liver. Results showed that the mRNA level of DGAT was maximal in LW, the minimal in LY. Finally, the expression of DGAT1 gene was positively correlated with BFT and not IMF; DGAT2 gene was positively correlated with IMF and not BFT. The results indicated that the two genes have a different function in fat deposition; in addition, the IMF contents were significantly different among breeds (P<0.01), and not significantly different among BFT (P>0.05). Based on results of DGAT1 and DGAT2 expression we suggested that the function of IMF and BFT was not the same and the deposition of IMF and BFT was regulated by different mechanisms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLarge White 3aanimal fats and oils 3aboars 3acorrelation 3agene expression 3agenes 3aintramuscular fat 3aliver 3alongissimus muscle 3ameat quality 3amessenger RNA 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction1 aZeng, Y.Q.1 aWang, H.1 aChen, W.1 aDu, J.F.1 aChen, Q.M.1 aHu, Y.X.1 aYang, L.0 tLivestock science.g2011 Sept., v. 140, no. 1-3 p.292-296dElsevier B.V.x1871-14137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.livsci.2011.04.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03205naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245013000168300001600298500001900314520160000333592002801933650001501961650001801976650001101994650002202005650001902027650001902046650001402065650002302079650001802102650001302120650005802133650001902191650002902210653002002239653001902259653002202278653001402300653002002314653001302334700002302347700002302370700001602393700002002409700002002429773014602449856008302595852000902678655001202687IND60659270520221119071131.0190913e20191022xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065927052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2019.08.1082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIshida, Yo-ichi10aDifferential oxidation processes of peroxiredoxin 2 dependent on the reaction with several peroxides in human red blood cells  ap. 685-690.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPeroxiredoxins (Prxs) detoxify hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), peroxynitrite, and various organic hydroperoxides. However, the differential oxidative status of Prxs reacted with each peroxide remains unclear. In the present study, we focused on the oxidative alteration of Prxs and demonstrated that, in human red blood cells (RBCs), peroxiredoxin 2 (Prx2) is readily reactive with H2O2, forming disulfide dimers, but was not easily hyperoxidized. In contrast, Prx2 was highly sensitive to the relatively hydrophobic oxidants, such as tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BHP) and cumene hydroperoxide. These peroxides hyperoxidized Prx2 into oxidatively damaged forms in RBCs. The t-BHP treatment formed hyperoxidized Prx2 in a dose-dependent manner. When organic hydroperoxide-treated RBC lysates were subjected to reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography, two peaks derived from hyperoxidized Prx2 appeared along with the decrease of that corresponding to native Prx2. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis clearly showed that hyperoxidation to sulfonic acid (-SO3H) at Cys-51 residue was more advanced in a newfound hyperoxidized Prx2 compared to another hydrophobic hyperoxidized form previously identified. These results indicate that irreversible hyperoxidation of the Prx2 monomer in RBCs was easily caused by organic hydroperoxide but not H2O2. Thus, it is important to detect the hyperoxidation of Prx2 into sulfinic or sulfonic acid derivates of Cys-51 because hyperoxidized Prx2 is a potential marker of oxidative injury caused by organic hydroperoxides in human RBCs.  aPublisher supplied data 3adisulfides 3adose response 3ahumans 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ahydroperoxides 3ahydrophobicity 3aoxidation 3aoxidative toxicity 3aperoxiredoxin 3aresearch 3areversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography 3asulfonic acids 3atandem mass spectrometry 0aPeroxiredoxin 2 0aHyperoxidation 0aOxidative process 0aBiomarker 0aRed blood cells 0aPeroxide1 aIchinowatari, Yuko1 aNishimoto, Shoichi1 aKoike, Shin1 aIshii, Kazuyuki1 aOgasawara, Yuki0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2019 Oct. 22, v. 518, no. 4 p.685-690dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2019.08.1083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03324naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245012800165300001600293520157200309592002801881650001701909650001701926650001301943650001701956650001501973650001701988650003502005650001902040650001402059650000902073650002102082650001702103650001602120650001302136650001302149650002502162650001202187650001502199653001502214653001702229653001302246653001302259653002502272653001602297700001902313700005802332700001302390700002502403700005302428700005202481773011802533856008602651852000902737655001202746IND60625188320221120111257.0201230e20190215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062518832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2018.11.1292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZou, Quan10aVanadium and chromium-contaminated soil remediation using VFAs derived from food waste as soil washing agents: A case study  ap. 895-901.  aFood waste (FW) is environmentally unfriendly and decays easily under ambient conditions. Vanadium (V) and chromium (Cr) contamination in soils has become an increasing concern due to risks to human health and environmental conservation. Volatile fatty acids (VFAs) derived from FW was applied as soil washing agent to treat V and Cr-contaminated soil collected from a former V smelter site in this work. The Community Bureau of Reference (BCR) three-step sequential extraction procedure was used to identify geochemical fractions of V and Cr influencing their mobility and biological toxicity. Optimal parameters of a single washing procedure were determined to be a 4 h contact time, liquid–solid ratio of 10:1, VFAs concentration of 30 g/L, and reaction temperature of 25 °C, considering for typical soil remediation projects and complete anaerobic fermentation of FW. Under the optimal conditions, butyric acid fermentation VFAs attained removal rates of 57.09 and 23.55% for extractable fractions of V and Cr, respectively. Simultaneously, a multi-washing process under a constant liquid–solid ratio using fresh and recycled VFAs was conducted, which led to an improvement on the total removal efficiency of toxic metals. The washing procedure could reach the pollution thresholds for several plants, such as of S. viridis, K. scoparia, M. sativa, and E. indica. This strategy enhances the utilization of VFAs derived from food waste, has a positive effect on V and Cr-contaminated soil remediation, wastewater control of soil washing and FW disposal.  aPublisher supplied data 3abutyric acid 3acase studies 3achromium 3afermentation 3afood waste 3ahuman health 3anatural resources conservation 3apolluted soils 3apollution 3arisk 3asoil remediation 3asoil washing 3atemperature 3atoxicity 3avanadium 3avolatile fatty acids 3awashing 3awastewater 0aFood waste 0aSoil washing 0aVanadium 0aChromium 0aVolatile fatty acids 0aReusability1 aXiang, Honglin1 aJiang, Jianguo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0074-040X1 aLi, Dean1 aAihemaiti, Aikelaimu1 aYan, Feng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9603-29681 aLiu, Nuo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1334-422X0 tJournal of environmental management.g2019 Feb. 15, v. 232 p.895-901dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2018.11.1293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02223naa a2200349 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075024005100099040001800150100001600168245011900184300001600303500000900319500001500328520107300343592002801416650002001444650001901464650001901483650001601502650001301518650002901531653001101560700002401571700001801595700002001613773012101633852000901754856009801763655001201861991579238030742620221122045002.0191122e197807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7891394402DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci1978.0011183X001800040029x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoll, R.

The populations derived from six selection cycles were evaluated in 12 year-location environ. ments, and the eight cycle populations and their hybrids were evaluated in a separate study in five year-location environments. Results of the two studies were in good agreement. Genetic environmental interactions were largely accounted for by responsiveness to environmental variation. Improved populations which were the direct result of selection were more responsive than the original populations. Other populations in which improvements resulted from indirect effects of selection showed less consistency in their responsiveness. Heterosis was increased after reciprocal recurrent selection and decreased slightly after full-sib family selection. Changes in heterosis were found to be compatible with a simple dominance genetic model.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrop production 3aplant genetics 3aplant breeding 3afield crops 3aagronomy 3aplant cultural practices 0aplants1 aCockerham, C.

In this consensus document, the BILULU Study Group presents a practical approach for the implementation of existing guidelines for the culture of urine in the microbiology laboratory and offers answers for issues where no clear solution is available in the guidelines.  aPublisher supplied data 3aguidelines 3alaboratory diagnosis 3amicrobiology 3atechnicians 3aurinary tract diseases 3aurine 0aUTI 0aWBC 0aCFU 0aGBS 0aIDSA 0aCNA 0aUrinary tract infections 0aGuidelines 0aUropathogens 0aBILULU1 aVan Meensel, Britt1 aCartuyvels, Reinoud1 aFrans, Johan1 aLaffut, Wim1 aVandecandelaere, Patricia1 aDe Beenhouwer, Hans0 tJournal of microbiological methods.g2018 Mar., v. 146 p.92-99dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6372x0167-70127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mimet.2018.02.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03105naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245010800170300001600278520143500294536010801729592002801837596001901865650001501884650000901899650001901908650001301927650002301940650001501963650001101978650002401989650001402013650001302027650001602040650000902056650001602065651001202081653001402093653001802107653002902125700002602154700001802180700001602198700002202214700001502236700001802251700001802269700001602287700002002303700001402323773010702337856008602444852000902530655001202539IND60759218720221122003239.0211207e20211002xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075921872DNAL7 a10.1080/21501203.2021.19413712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aImade, Francis10aUpdates on food and feed mycotoxin contamination and safety in Africa with special reference to Nigeria  ap. 245-260.  aMycotoxin contamination of food and feed is a major concern in sub-Sahara African countries, particularly Nigeria. It represents a significant limit to health of human, livestock as well as the international trade. Aflatoxins, fumonisins, ochratoxin, zearalenone, deoxynivalenol and beauvericin are the major mycotoxins recognised in the aetiology of food safety challenges that precipitated countless number of diseases. In Nigeria, aflatoxins and fumonisin found in nearly all crops are the most common mycotoxins of economic and health importance such as sorghum, maize and groundnuts. Thus, consumption of food contaminated with mycotoxins are inevitable, hence the need for adequate regulation is necessary in these frontier economies as done in many developed economies to ensure food safety for human and animals. In low and middle-income countries, especially Nigeria, there is lack of awareness and sufficient information on the risk associated with consequent of mycotoxin contamination on wellbeing of human, animals health and the economy. It is based on the foregoing that this paper summarized the status of mycotoxin present in Nigerian food and feeds relative to the global regulatory standards. This aimed at preventing consuming mycotoxin contaminated food stuff while confronting its associated challenges. Suggestions on some possible control strategies to mitigate vending mycotoxin food and feeds were made.  aThis work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China [2019YFC1604502].  aPublisher supplied data  a2019YFC1604502 3aaflatoxins 3acorn 3adeoxynivalenol 3aetiology 3afood contamination 3afumonisins 3ahumans 3ainternational trade 3alivestock 3amycology 3aochratoxins 3arisk 3azearalenone 3aNigeria 0aMycotoxin 0acontamination 0aagricultural commodities1 aAnkwasa, Edgar Mugizi1 aGeng, Hairong1 aUllah, Sana1 aAḥmad, Tanvīr,1 aWang, Gang1 aZhang, Chenxi1 aDada, Oyeyemi1 aXing, Fuguo1 aZheng, Yongquan1 aLiu, Yang0 tMycology.g2021 Oct. 02, v. 12, no. 4 p.245-260dTaylor & FranciswJournal:J000000125x2150-12117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/21501203.2021.19413713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02799naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002700139245011400166520124300280592002801523650001801551650001501569650001801584650002501602650002001627650001801647650002301665650001101688650002301699650002201722650002001744650002701764651001901791651001101810651001701821651002201838651001201860651001101872700002101883700002801904700002301932700002101955700002701976700002402003700002202027700002702049773012302076856007302199852000902272655001202281IND60670046620221122065354.0190925e20190827xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067004662DNAL7 a10.3390/d110901492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDimitriou, Andreas  C.10aGenetic Data Suggest Multiple Introductions of the Lionfish (<i>Pterois miles</i>) into the Mediterranean Sea  aWidespread reports over the last six years confirm the establishment of lionfish (Pterois miles) populations in the eastern Mediterranean. Accumulated knowledge on lionfish invasions in the western Atlantic Ocean has shown that it is a successful invader and can have negative impacts on native species, indirect ecological repercussions and economic effects on local human societies. Here we analysed genetic sequences of lionfish from Cyprus as well as data from the whole distribution of the species, targeting the mtDNA markers cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (COI) and the control region (CR). Our results reflect a pattern of repeated introductions into the Mediterranean from the northern Red Sea and a secondary spread of this species west to Rhodes and Sicily. Presented results agree with previously published studies highlighting the genetic similarity with individuals from the northern Red Sea. Nevertheless, some individuals from Cyprus, in addition to those coming via the Suez Canal, were genetically similar to fish from the Indian Ocean, indicating genetic homogeneity among populations of P. miles across its current distribution, possibly facilitated by the ornamental fish trade and/or transport through ballast water.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPterois miles 3aSuez Canal 3aballast water 3acytochrome-c oxidase 3aeconomic impact 3afish industry 3agenetic similarity 3ahumans 3aindigenous species 3amitochondrial DNA 3aornamental fish 3asecondary transmission 3aAtlantic Ocean 3aCyprus 3aIndian Ocean 3aMediterranean Sea 3aRed Sea 3aSicily1 aChartosia, Niki 1 aHall-Spencer, Jason  M.1 aKleitou, Periklis 1 aJimenez, Carlos 1 aAntoniou, Charalampos 1 aHadjioannou, Louis 1 aKletou, Demetris 1 aSfenthourakis, Spyros 0 tDiversity.g2019 Aug. 27, v. 11, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21675x1424-28187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/d110901493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01939naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245015200167300001400319520087500333592002801208650002001236650002901256653002301285653002301308653002301331653002201354653002201376653001801398773011801416856008201534852000901616655001201625IND60603552220221119221630.0180716e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060355222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.csda.2014.11.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aManté, Claude10aIterated Bernstein operators for distribution function and density estimation: Balancing between the number of iterations and the polynomial degree  ap. 68-84.  aDespite its slow convergence, the use of the Bernstein polynomial approximation is becoming more frequent in Statistics, especially for density estimation of compactly supported probability distributions. This is due to its numerous attractive properties, from both an approximation (uniform shape-preserving approximation, etc.) and a statistical (bona fide estimation, low boundary bias, etc.) point of view. An original method for estimating distribution functions and densities with Bernstein polynomials is proposed, which takes advantage of results about the eigenstructure of the Bernstein operator to refine a convergence acceleration method. Furthermore, an original data-driven method for choosing the degree of the polynomial is worked out. The method is successfully applied to two data-sets which are important benchmarks in the field of Density Estimation.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3aprobability distribution 0aDensity estimation 0aBernstein operator 0aRoots of operators 0aRegular histogram 0aShape restriction 0aGnedenko test0 tComputational statistics & data analysis.g2015 Apr., v. 84 p.68-84dElsevier B.V.wJournal:3109x0167-94737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.csda.2014.11.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03381naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094024002200128024001900150040001800169100002000187245015700207300001300364506007600377520145100453592002801904506003701932650001101969650002201980650002002002650001002022650003802032650001902070650001102089650001202100650003102112650001402143650001302157650001302170650003602183650002602219650002002245650001202265653002902277653001202306653002302318653002102341653001702362700002302379700001602402700002602418700001902444700002402463700002702487700002102514700002302535773012002558856008002678852000902758655001202767IND60598400020221207133659.0180629e20140815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059840002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ab.2014.04.0252doi7 aPMC48107802pmcid7 a247993472pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPark, Sook Ryun10aValidation of a hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha specimen collection procedure and quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in solid tumor tissues  ap. 1-11.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aHypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1α) is an important marker of hypoxia in human tumors and has been implicated in tumor progression. Drugs targeting HIF-1α are being developed, but the ability to measure drug-induced changes in HIF-1α is limited by the lability of the protein in normoxia. Our goal was to devise methods for specimen collection and processing that preserve HIF-1α in solid tumor tissues and to develop and validate a two-site chemiluminescent quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for HIF-1α. We tested various strategies for HIF-1α stabilization in solid tumors, including nitrogen gas-purged lysis buffer, the addition of proteasome inhibitors or the prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor 2-hydroxyglutarate, and bead homogenization. Degassing and the addition of 2-hydroxyglutarate to the collection buffer significantly increased HIF-1α recovery, whereas bead homogenization in sealed tubes improved HIF-1α recovery and reduced sample variability. Validation of the ELISA demonstrated intra- and inter-assay variability of less than 15% and accuracy of 99.8±8.3% as assessed by spike recovery. Inter-laboratory reproducibility was also demonstrated (R²=0.999). Careful sample handling techniques allow us to quantitatively detect HIF-1α in samples as small as 2.5μg of total protein extract, and this method is currently being applied to analyze tumor biopsy specimens in early-phase clinical trials.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abiopsy 3achemiluminescence 3aclinical trials 3adrugs 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3ahomogenization 3ahumans 3ahypoxia 3ahypoxia-inducible factor 1 3aneoplasms 3anitrogen 3anormoxia 3aprocollagen-proline dioxygenase 3aproteasome inhibitors 3aprotein content 3atissues 0aHypoxia-inducible factor 0aHIF-1α 0aQuantitative ELISA 0aPharmacodynamics 0aSolid tumors1 aKinders, Robert J.1 aKhin, Sonny1 aHollingshead, Melinda1 aAntony, Smitha1 aParchment, Ralph E.1 aTomaszewski, Joseph E.1 aKummar, Shivaani1 aDoroshow, James H.0 tAnalytical biochemistry.g2014 Aug. 15, v. 459 p.1-11dElsevier Inc.aElsevier Inc.wJournal:11652x0003-26977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ab.2014.04.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02838naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005800148245014900206300001600355520144100371592002801812650001301840650001701853650001801870650002701888650002501915650001501940650004301955650001101998650002102009650002202030650001702052650001902069650001402088650001702102650001502119650001902134650001002153700002702163773012302190856008202313852000902395655001202404IND60696371420221121104015.0200523e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069637142DNAL7 a10.1007/s00344-019-10015-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYaman, Mustafa1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9692-020410aInvestigation of the Effects of the Fenoxaprop-p-Ethyl Herbicide and Salicylic Acid on the Ascorbic Acid and Vitamin B6 Vitamers in Wheat Leaves  ap. 729-737.  aHerbicides inhibit plant growth and development by various mechanisms, and oxidative stress is a common plant response to herbicide treatment. In a limited number of studies, it has been shown that vitamins are also strong antioxidants. It has been also known that salicylic acid (SA), a natural compound, plays a role in the activation of plant defences. This study examined the effects of the fenoxaprop-p-ethyl (FE) herbicide and SA on the ascorbic acid and B₆ vitamers (pyridoxine, pyridoxal, and pyridoxamine) in wheat leaves. After the wheat plants were grown for 15 days, the leaves were subjected to FE, SA (0.05, 0.5 and 5 mM), and FE + SA treatments for 24, 48, and 72 h. Then, the leaves were cut, and levels of ascorbic acid and B₆ vitamers were analyzed. The vitamin analyses were performed by means of HPLC. It was found that the FE has caused to increase the ascorbic acid level but generally to decrease in all three forms of vitamin B₆. When FE and SA treatments are applied together, it has been revealed that SA regulates the increasing of ascorbic acid levels and the decreasing of B₆ vitamers levels by bringing the control levels. It can be concluded that exogenous SA by its contribution on endogenous SA content could play an ameliorating role on herbicide tolerance and the negative effects of herbicides can be reduced on the crop condition by applying an appropriate exogenous SA concentration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTriticum 3aantioxidants 3aascorbic acid 3agrowth and development 3aherbicide resistance 3aherbicides 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aleaves 3aoxidative stress 3aplant development 3aplant growth 3aplant response 3apyridoxal 3apyridoxamine 3apyridoxine 3asalicylic acid 3awheat1 aNalbantoğlu, Barbaros0 tJournal of plant growth regulation.g2020 June, v. 39, no. 2 p.729-737dSpringer USwJournal:jnl33237x0721-75957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00344-019-10015-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02442naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001200146245012300158300002000281520137100301592002801672650001201700650001201712650002001724650002201744650001601766700001801782700005801800700001301858700001701871773013801888856008102026852000902107655001202116IND60756116820221119152315.0211111e20211028xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075611682DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c074292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBi, Yan10aTriphenylsilyl-Promoted Iridium Complex for High-Performance Green-Yellow Phosphorescent Organic Light-Emitting Diodes  ap. 24671-24684.  aIn this work, a novel triphenylsilyl-based iridium complex, fac-Ir(tpsp)₂(bpp), is developed. Triphenylsilyl groups endow fac-Ir(tpsp)₂(bpp) with favorable intermolecular interactions. On the one hand, the steric hindrance of a triphenylsilyl group significantly weakens intermolecular π···π interactions. On the other hand, triphenylsilyl ligands provide several C–H···π interactions for fac-Ir(tpsp)₂(bpp). As a result, fac-Ir(tpsp)₂(bpp) exhibits a high sublimation yield (78.2%), high photoluminescence quantum yield (97.6%), short lifetime (510.9 ns), low concentration sensitivity (10–⁶ to 10–⁴ M), and moderate charge-transporting ability. Phosphorescent devices that utilize fac-Ir(tpsp)₂(bpp) as the emitter display high efficiencies (100.9 cd/A, 105.6 lm/W, 27.9%), low roll-off of efficiencies (from 100 to 10,000 cd/m²: 5.3%), relatively low concentration sensitivity (from 5 to 12%), long device lifetime (61,892 h at 100 cd/m²), and very stable electroluminescent spectra (from 1 to 70,000 cd/m²). This performance is comparable to those of previous record green/yellow phosphorescent emitters. More importantly, most of record emitters report limited excellent parameters, and comprehensive emitter-like fac-Ir(tpsp)₂(bpp) is rare. These results demonstrate that fac-Ir(tpsp)₂(bpp) is a good phosphorescent emitter.  aPublisher supplied data 3airidium 3aligands 3aphosphorescence 3aphotoluminescence 3asublimation1 aWei, Jiacheng1 aChen, Shanyong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2056-17671 aZhao, He1 aZhang, Xiyan0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2021 Oct. 28, v. 125, no. 44 p.24671-24684dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c074293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01781naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001700146245008800163300001400251520066400265592002800929650000800957650001200965650001000977650002600987650002601013650001401039653002001053653001001073653001401083653001801097653002801115700001801143700002201161700001701183773010601200856008001306852000901386655001201395IND60598400220221122053333.0180629e20140715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059840022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ab.2014.04.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Min S.10aFacile generation of cell microarrays using vacuum degassing and coverslip sweeping  ap. 48-50.  aA simple method to generate cell microarrays with high-percentage well occupancy and well-defined cell confinement is presented. This method uses a synergistic combination of vacuum degassing and coverslip sweeping. The vacuum degassing step dislodges air bubbles from the microwells, which in turn enables the cells to enter the microwells, while the physical sweeping step using a glass coverslip removes the excess cells outside the microwells. This low-cost preparation method provides a simple solution to generating cell microarrays that can be performed in basic research laboratories and point-of-care settings for routine cell-based screening assays.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3abubbles 3aglass 3amicroarray technology 3apoint-of-care systems 3ascreening 0aMicrowell array 0aCells 0aScreening 0aDrug response 0aFluorescence microscopy1 aLuo, Zhenren,1 aCherukuri, Sundar1 aNitin, Nitin0 tAnalytical biochemistry.g2014 July 15, v. 457 p.48-50dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11652x0003-26977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ab.2014.04.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02331naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245010600167300001600273520111300289592002801402650001401430650001101444650001401455650001101469650002901480650002401509650002501533650000901558653003601567653002101603653002201624653002101646653001701667653002101684700001401705700001701719773009101736856008501827852000901912655001201921IND60566470520221119163801.0180830e20160915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056647052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2016.06.0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Xiaosong10aGreener plug-in hybrid electric vehicles incorporating renewable energy and rapid system optimization  ap. 971-980.  aIt is imperative to explore the full carbon dioxide-saving potential for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. This paper seeks to examine the role of renewable energy and powertrain optimization in minimizing daily carbon emissions of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. A spectrum of influencing factors are investigated, including charging protocol, timing, on-road power management strategy, battery size, and carbon-emission intensity of the grid. A high-efficiency convex programming framework is harnessed to optimize a plug-in hybrid powertrain. Two originally important contributions evidently distinguish this work from existing efforts. First, diverse heuristic scenarios and concomitant weaknesses are elucidated, and the carbon reductions arising from renewable energy integration and the convex programming framework are quantified. The great importance of their synergy is accentuated, i.e., swiftly adapting charging/power management controls to wind intermittency. Second, battery health implication is explored for the optimal and heuristic scenarios, via a dynamic battery State-of-Health model.  aPublisher supplied data 3abatteries 3acarbon 3aemissions 3amodels 3arenewable energy sources 3asystem optimization 3avehicles (equipment) 3awind 0aPlug-in hybrid electric vehicle 0aComponent sizing 0aEnergy management 0aCharging control 0aOptimization 0aRenewable energy1 aZou, Yuan1 aYang, Yalian0 tEnergy.g2016 Sept. 15, v. 111 p.971-980dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2016.06.0373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01824naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001600146245007800162300001200240520070600252592002800958650000800986650001500994650001101009650001501020650001101035650001501046650002801061650001101089650003201100653001801132653003201150653001001182653001101192653001101203700001901214773010401233856008001337852000901417655001201426IND60598400320221120184517.0180629e20140801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059840032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ab.2014.04.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Sungil12aA lipid-based method for the preparation of a piezoelectric DNA biosensor  ap. 1-3.  aA piezoelectric DNA biosensor was prepared by immobilizing DNA probes on a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) using a lipid-based method.

The interplay of the molecular structure, pH-sensitive absorption and emission, and photodynamic and photothermal activities was well studied in detail. Photoinduced electron transfer, intramolecular charge transfer, and heavy atom effect were leveraged to engineer BDP with tumor imaging and therapeutic functions. The BDP nanoparticle formulations possessed multifunctional biological features, including selective treatment of cancer cells, near-infrared fluorescence, photoacoustic and computed tomography imaging, and photodynamic and photothermal therapy, as validated by cellular and animal experiments.

However, heterogeneity in these associations may exist across the distribution of methylation outcomes. This study examined whether the association between three-week averaged of temperature and methylation differs across quantiles of the methylation distributions in nine candidate genes. We measured gene-specific blood methylation repeatedly in 777 elderly men participating in the Normative Aging Study (1999–2010). We fit quantile regressions for longitudinal data to investigate whether the associations of temperature on methylation (expressed as %5mC) varied across the distribution of the methylation outcomes. We observed heterogeneity in the associations of temperature across percentiles of methylation in F3, TLR-2, CRAT, iNOS, and ICAM-1 genes. For instance, an increase in three-week temperature exposure was associated with a longer left-tail of the F3 methylation distribution. A 5°C increase in temperature was associated with a 0.15%5mC (95% confidence interval (CI): −0.27,−0.04) decrease on the 20th quantile of F3 methylation, but was not significantly related to the 80th quantile of this distribution (Estimate:0.06%5mC, 95%CI: −0.22, 0.35). Individuals with low values of F3, TLR-2, CRAT, and iNOS methylation, as well as a high value of ICAM-1 methylation, may be more susceptible to temperature effects on systemic inflammation.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA methylation 3ablood 3aconfidence interval 3aelderly 3agenes 3ainducible nitric oxide synthase 3ainflammation 3aintercellular adhesion molecule-1 3amen 3atemperature 0aQuantile regression 0aTemperature 0aDNA methylation 0aSusceptibility1 aCoull, Brent A.1 aBaccarelli, Andrea1 aTarantini, Letizia1 aCantone, Laura1 aVokonas, Pantel1 aSchwartz, Joel0 tEnvironmental research.g2016 Oct., v. 150 p.38-46dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12442x0013-93517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2016.05.0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03290naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005700148245008100205300001600286500001100302520138500313592002801698650001901726650001701745650001801762650001601780650001901796650001601815650002001831650002201851650002901873650002601902650001801928650001701946650001901963650001901982650001302001650001902014650002202033700001702055700001902072700002102091700002902112700002402141700001602165700001902181700001802200700001902218700001802237700001802255700002502273700002202298700002402320700001602344700002702360700001902387700002002406773012302426856008202549852000902631655001202640IND60696371820221121104011.0200523e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069637182DNAL7 a10.1007/s00344-019-10018-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSharma, Anket1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5251-904510aPhotosynthetic Response of Plants Under Different Abiotic Stresses: A Review  ap. 509-531.  aReview  aPlants encounter various abiotic stresses due to their sessile nature which include heavy metals, salt, drought, nutrient deficiency, light intensity, pesticide contamination, as well as extreme temperatures. These stresses impose major constraints limiting crop production and food security worldwide. Abiotic stresses primarily reduce the photosynthetic efficiency of plants, due to their negative consequences on chlorophyll biosynthesis, performance of the photosystems, electron transport mechanisms, gas exchange parameters, and many others. A better understanding of the photochemistry of plants under these abiotic stresses can help in the development of pragmatic interventions for managing these stresses. Interestingly, in this review, we provide an overview of insight into different mechanisms affecting the photosynthetic ability of plants in relation to these abiotic factors. The present review describes how different abiotic stresses can pose deleterious impacts on plant photosynthetic machinery including cellular membranes, cell division and cell elongation, biosynthesis of photosynthetic pigments, as well as electron transport chain. It is important to understand the detrimental impacts of various abiotic stresses for better stress management because a comprehensive understanding of plant responses has pragmatic implication for remedies and management.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabiotic stress 3abiosynthesis 3acell division 3acell growth 3acell membranes 3achlorophyll 3acrop production 3aelectron transfer 3aelectron transport chain 3aenvironmental factors 3afood security 3agas exchange 3aphotochemistry 3aphotosynthesis 3apigments 3aplant response 3astress management1 aKumar, Vinod1 aShahzad, Babar1 aRamakrishnan, M.1 aSingh Sidhu, Gagan Preet1 aBali, Aditi Shreeya1 aHanda, Neha1 aKapoor, Dhriti1 aYadav, Poonam1 aKhanna, Kanika1 aBakshi, Palak1 aRehman, Abdul1 aKohli, Sukhmeen Kaur1 aKhan, Ekhlaque A.1 aParihar, Ripu Daman1 aYuan, Huwei1 aThukral, Ashwani Kumar1 aBhardwaj, Renu1 aZheng, Bingsong0 tJournal of plant growth regulation.g2020 June, v. 39, no. 2 p.509-531dSpringer USwJournal:jnl33237x0721-75957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00344-019-10018-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02383naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002900144242016600173245013800339300001400477520104000491592002801531650002001559650001601579650002101595650001601616650002401632650002101656650001401677650001501691650001201706650001001718650001101728650001201739700002601751700002401777773009701801856007801898852000901976655001201985IND60132725620221119011808.0150511e200701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013272562DNAL7 a10.1051/forest:20060902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMendoza de Gyves, Emilio10aDéveloppement d’une méthode efficace de micropropagation et d’enracinement in vitro du teak (Tectona grandis L.) pour une production industrielle de plants10aEfficient method of micropropagation and in vitro rooting of teak (Tectona grandis L.) focusing on large-scale industrial plantations  ap. 73-78.  aMultiple shoots of high quality were produced in vitro from nodal expiants of Tectona grandis. An average of about 4 shoots/uninodal expiant was obtained within 4 weeks of culture on Murashige and Skoog’s (mMS) medium modified by 50% reduction in NH₄NO₃concentration, supplemented with benzylaminopurine (1.5 mg L⁻¹); indole-3-butyric acid (0.01 mg L⁻¹) and gibberellic acid (0.1 mg L⁻¹). The latter was applied both in the medium and by soaking the nodal segments for 10 s. in a gibberellic acid solution of 100 mg L⁻¹. Hundred percent of shoots rooted cultured on modified MS medium containing IBA (0.5 mg L⁻¹) and putrescine (160 mg L⁻¹). Putrescine promoted both strong and highly ramified roots and fast growing shoots during the rooting phase, conditioning the plantlets for a good survival and quality. Plantlets were transferred to jiffy pots for a short acclimatization stage in greenhouse where they survived at 100%. This highly reproducible procedure can be adopted for large scale teak propagation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTectona grandis 3aacclimation 3agibberellic acid 3agreenhouses 3aindole butyric acid 3amicropropagation 3aplantlets 3aputrescine 3arooting 3aroots 3ashoots 3asoaking1 aRoyani, Juwartina Ida1 aRugini, E.q(Eddo),0 tAnnals of forest science.g2007 Jan., v. 64, no. 1 p.73-78dSpringer-Verlagx1286-45607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1051/forest:20060903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02376naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001400146245009800160300002000258520129200278592002801570650001501598650001901613650002301632650001701655650002201672650001401694650001301708700001601721700001501737700005801752773013801810856008101948852000902029655001202038IND60756117220221119152342.0211111e20211028xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075611722DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c075422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTong, Wei10aMolecular Simulation on Thermodynamic Swelling Behavior of Bilayer Graphene Oxide in Solvents  ap. 24692-24701.  aSolvation swelling for graphene oxide (GO)-layered materials is a key property that determines the capacity for species permeation and adsorption inside GO interlayers, which hold great promise for wide applications. Currently, diverse variations and controversies for the measured interlayer spacings appear in the literature. While experimental measurement could provide a macroscopic image of interlayer spacings for layered GOs, a theoretical simulation of the interlayer swelling for GO-layered materials in solvent media is very essential, which is able to provide a fundamental basis for further understanding the complicated interlayer swelling behavior. Herein, we used metadynamics (MTD) molecular dynamics (MD) simulation to explore the swelling free-energy profiles for layered GO structures immersed in solvents. The stable spacings have been simulated for layered GOs in typical solvents, which appears to be quite consistent with experimental results. The effects of surface oxidization degrees and initial water contents on the GO swelling behavior have been investigated. The simulation results can be applied to elucidate the diverse experimental results. Our research provides thermodynamic insight into the swelling behavior of GO-layered structures in solvent media.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3agraphene oxide 3amolecular dynamics 3apermeability 3asimulation models 3asolvation 3asolvents1 aCui, Dandan1 aXu, Zhijun1 aYang, Xiaoning1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0811-37740 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2021 Oct. 28, v. 125, no. 44 p.24692-24701dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c075423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01664naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100003000146245007900176300001400255520056500269592002800834650002300862650001600885650001700901650002000918650001000938653001700948653001500965653001600980653001500996653003001011700002001041700001701061700001701078773010601095856008001201852000901281655001201290IND60598400520221120184505.0180629e20140801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059840052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ab.2014.04.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheong, Brandon Huey-Ping10aScribed transparency microplates mounted on a modified standard microplate  ap. 40-42.  aThe immense cost effectiveness of using transparencies as analyte handling implements in microplate instrumentation offers the possibility of application even in resource-limited laboratories.

In this study, attached and unattached Ixodid ticks were removed from companion animals by a veterinary practice in Hall County, Georgia. DNA was extracted from unengorged adult ticks and each was screened for the presence of Rickettsia spp. by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequenced to determine the species present. Two hundred and four adult hard-bodied ticks were identified to species and Rickettsia spp. were found in 19.6% (n = 38) of the 194 analyzed DNA extracts. Rickettsia montanensis was found in Dermacentor variablis (14.7%; n = 25), Amblyomma maculatum (33.3%; n = 2), and Rhipicephalus sanguineus s.l. ticks (25%; n = 4). One Amblyomma americanum tick contained Rickettsia amblyommatis, while Rickettsia felis was found in one Dermacentor variablis tick, serving as the first report of Rickettsia felis in a tick in this region and within this tick vector. This study suggests that there is a risk of companion animals contracting a species of Rickettsia from a tick bite in northeastern Georgia, indicating a need for more investigation and highlighting the importance of tick prevention on pets.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmblyomma americanum 3aAmblyomma maculatum 3aDNA 3aDermacentor 3aRhipicephalus sanguineus 3aRickettsia felis 3aRickettsia montanensis 3aadults 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arisk 3aticks 3aveterinary clinics 3aGeorgia1 aRhodes, DeLacy  V.

In recent years, biologically active compounds have been isolated from smoke with potential uses in agriculture and horticulture. This article highlights the possibilities of using smoke-water or smoke-derived butenolide (3-methyl-2H-furo[2,3-c]pyran-2-one, termed karrikinolide, KAR₁) for the cultivation of agricultural and horticultural crops. Treatments with smoke-water show promising results for improving seed germination, seedling growth and crop productivity. In certain cases, even under adverse conditions, such as low or high temperatures and low osmotic potentials, smoke-water or a KAR₁ solution can promote seed germination and seedling growth. This phenomenon is of great significance when seeds are sown under drought conditions. Smoke-technology, therefore, has potential for use in arid and semi-arid regions. Possibilities may also exist for controlling some plant diseases and managing weeds with the use of smoke or KAR₁ solutions. In addition, smoke-technology can possibly economize the use of commercial chemical fertilizers, pesticides and herbicides, making it a feasible technology for organic farming and for resource-poor farmers in developing nations. The positive role of smoke-water in flowering and fruiting of crops cannot be overlooked as the karrikins found in smoke are now recognized as potential new plant growth regulators. Very low concentrations of smoke-water or a KAR₁ solution are effective in promoting germination and post-germination growth. Thus, early harvesting and increasing the productivity of crops using smoke-technology may be possible. Here we review some of the effects of smoke and KAR₁ on various crop species and discuss the potential uses of smoke technology in agriculture and horticulture.  aPublisher supplied data 3adeveloping countries 3adrought 3afarmers 3afertilizers 3aflowering 3aharvesting 3aherbicides 3ahorticultural crops 3ahorticulture 3aorganic production 3aplant diseases and disorders 3aplant growth substances 3aseed germination 3aseedling growth 3aseeds 3asemiarid zones 3asmoke 3atemperature 3atraditional farming 3aweeds1 aLight, M.E.1 aVan Staden, J.0 tSouth African journal of botany.g2011 Oct., v. 77, no. 4 p.972-979dElsevier B.V.x0254-62997nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sajb.2011.08.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02635naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245013600173300001600309520137900325592002801704650001201732650001701744650001701761650002201778650001101800650001801811650001701829650002001846650002201866653001101888653002801899653002301927653001701950653001501967653003601982700002402018773008902042856008502131852000902216655001202225IND60566471020221119163825.0180830e20170515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056647102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2017.02.0552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhan, Salah Ud-Din10aKarachi Nuclear Power Plant (KANUPP): As case study for techno-economic assessment of nuclear power coupled with water desalination  ap. 372-380.  aThis paper is focused on the development of technical and economical prospective of Karachi Nuclear Power Plant (KANUPP) in terms of various desalination technologies. During the first phase, an initial research contingency to desalination technologies already running at KANUPP was discussed and evaluated for economic assessment. In the next phase, mathematical model was developed for calculating various parameters of desalination technologies. During this step, simulation model from IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency) named as DEEP & DE-TOP were used for calculating various desalination techniques including Reverse osmosis (RO), Multi effect desalination (MED), Multi stage desalination (MSF) and also for coupled technologies i.e., RO+MED and R0+MSF. Different parameters including capital/water cost and thermal desalination parameters were calculated for coupled desalination technologies for KANUPP. Number of stages for coupled KANUPP desalination plant in terms of experimental and computational analysis were carried out. The calculation shows that water cost for each coupled desalination technologies have varying trends. The objective of the research was to developed technical and economical viable model for coupled nuclear reactor desalination system. The research gives an indication to developed experimentally viable KANUPP desalination plant.  aPublisher supplied data 3acapital 3acase studies 3adesalination 3aeconomic analysis 3aenergy 3anuclear power 3apower plants 3areverse osmosis 3asimulation models 0aKANUPP 0aDesalination technology 0aMathematical model 0aCapital cost 0aWater cost 0aThermal desalination parameters1 aKhan, Shahab Ud-Din0 tEnergy.g2017 May 15, v. 127 p.372-380dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2017.02.0553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02304naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001900146245012200165300001400287520093600301592002801237650001601265650001501281650002301296650001801319650001101337650001401348650001501362650001501377650001301392650002801405653002401433653003901457653002701496653002701523700001501550700001201565700001401577700001401591700005801605773010601663856008001769852000901849655001201858IND60598400720221120170835.0180629e20140801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059840072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ab.2014.04.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZuo, Yong-Chun10aPredicting peroxidase subcellular location by hybridizing different descriptors of Chou’ pseudo amino acid patterns  ap. 14-19.  aPeroxidases as universal enzymes are essential for the regulation of reactive oxygen species levels and play major roles in both disease prevention and human pathologies. Automated prediction of functional protein localization is rarely reported and also is important for designing new drugs and drug targets. In this study, we first propose a support vector machine (SVM)-based method to predict peroxidase subcellular localization. Various Chou’ pseudo amino acid descriptors and gene ontology (GO)-homology patterns were selected as input features to multiclass SVM. Prediction results showed that the smoothed PSSM encoding pattern performed better than the other approaches. The best overall prediction accuracy was 87.0% in a jackknife test using a PSSM profile of pattern with width=5. We also demonstrate that the present GO annotation is far from complete or deep enough for annotating proteins with a specific function.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acids 3aautomation 3adisease prevention 3agene ontology 3ahumans 3anew drugs 3aperoxidase 3aprediction 3aproteins 3asupport vector machines 0aPeroxidase proteins 0aChou’ pseudo amino acid patterns 0aGO-homology annotation 0aPrediction performance1 aPeng, Yong1 aLiu, Li1 aChen, Wei1 aYang, Lei1 aFan, Guo-Liang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0943-61290 tAnalytical biochemistry.g2014 Aug. 01, v. 458 p.14-19dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11652x0003-26977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ab.2014.04.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02604naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245012400171300001400295520128200309592002801591650001301619650001201632650001401644650001101658650004101669650001201710650001101722650001201733650001101745650001401756650001501770650001601785653002401801653001501825653001201840653001901852653003001871700002301901700002101924773012201945856008202067852000902149655001202158IND60599844120221117155932.0180702e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059984412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jaap.2013.12.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNaqvi, Salman Raza10aCatalytic pyrolysis of paddy husk in a drop type pyrolyzer for bio-oil production: The role of temperature and catalyst  ap. 57-62.  aThe present research encompasses the impact of temperature and catalyst on the properties of bio-oils and on product yield for the pyrolysis of rice husk. Fast pyrolysis of paddy husks was conducted in a drop type pyrolyzer to study the influence of pyrolysis temperature 350–600°C on products yield and properties. In order to investigate the effect of catalyst, experiments were carried out for a wide range of ratios (0.5–2) of biomass at the pyrolysis temperature of 450°C. The presence of catalyst culminated in less bio-oil yield coupled with higher calorific values and high water contents in comparison to non-catalytic pyrolysis. Furthermore under dehydration and mild pyrolysis conditions the higher amount of catalyst resulted in bio-oil having high water and acidic contents. Oxygen removal degree was used to evaluate the oxygen content transferred from parent biomass to the obtained bio-oil. The ratio 0.5 showed the highest de-oxygenation degree (84.6%). The bio-oil produced at this ratio contained high phenol, phenolic compounds and less carbonyl and acidic contents. The bio-oil characterization (with and without catalyst) was evaluated and reported in terms of CHN/O and GC–MS (phenol, phenol derivatives, ketones, furans and aliphatic compounds).  aPublisher supplied data 3abiofuels 3abiomass 3acatalysts 3afurans 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3aketones 3aoxygen 3apaddies 3aphenol 3apyrolysis 3arice hulls 3atemperature 0aCatalytic pyrolysis 0aPaddy husk 0aBio-oil 0aDe-oxygenation 0aPhysiochemical properties1 aUemura, Yoshimitsu1 aYusup, Suzana Bt0 tJournal of analytical and applied pyrolysis.g2014 Mar., v. 106 p.57-62dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6382x0165-23707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaap.2013.12.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03077naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245012000165300001600285520130400301592002801605596005901633596005901692596006901751596006901820650001701889650002501906650002101931650002801952650001601980650002001996650002002016650001602036650001102052650002002063650001202083650001402095650002102109650001302130650002802143650003802171650000902209650001002218700001702228700001602245700001302261700005902274773012302333856008202456852000902538655001202547IND60696372120221121124559.0200523e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069637212DNAL7 a10.1007/s00344-019-10021-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Qilei10aEffects of Shading on the Senescence and Photosynthetic Physiology of the Early-Flowering Rice Mutant FTL10 at Noon  ap. 776-784.  aFTL10 is an early-flowering mutant of rice (Oryza sativa L.) with a premature senescent phenotype. Early leaf senescence can cause negative effects on rice yield. Moreover, rice leaves are damaged under high-light conditions, which promote rice senescence. Artificial shading can reduce the amount of light absorbed by rice leaves. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of shading at noon (11:30–14:00) on the senescence and yield of FTL10. The results showed that shading improved the total antioxidant capacity of rice leaves, reduced the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reduced the expression of genes related to senescence. In the shaded group, the degradation rate of chlorophyll and Rubisco proteins, which are related to photosynthesis, was relatively slow, and the photosynthetic rate was relatively high. Compared with those under the natural growth conditions, the proportion of photosynthetic electron allocated to photorespiration in the shaded group rice leaves was lower, and the proportion allocated to carbon fixation was higher. The yield data showed that the single-spike weight and yield per plant of rice significantly increased after shading. Therefore, our research shows that shading at noon could delay FTL10 senescence and increase yields.  aPublisher supplied data  a31870374cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31570398cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2015A030311023cNatural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province  a2017A030313167cNatural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province 3aOryza sativa 3aantioxidant activity 3aartificial shade 3acarbon dioxide fixation 3achlorophyll 3aearly flowering 3agene expression 3agrain yield 3aleaves 3alight intensity 3amutants 3aphenotype 3aphotorespiration 3aproteins 3areactive oxygen species 3aribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase 3arice 3ashade1 aZhai, Junjie1 aWei, Yanxia1 aLu, Lina1 aPeng, Changlian1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6497-45150 tJournal of plant growth regulation.g2020 June, v. 39, no. 2 p.776-784dSpringer USwJournal:jnl33237x0721-75957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00344-019-10021-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02610naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001400144245009400158300002000252520119100272592002801463650001501491650001401506650002201520650002401542650001501566653003001581653002101611653002101632653001201653653002801665700001501693700001901708700001901727700005101746700005301797700005301850700005601903773014201959856007802101852000902179655001202188IND60677421720221117235528.0191127e20191118xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067742172DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.9b164552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJi, Yanda10aBreaking Lattice Symmetry in Highly Strained Epitaxial VO₂ Films on Faceted Nanosurface  ap. 44905-44912.  aThe lattice symmetry of strongly correlated oxide heterostructures determines their exotic physical properties by coupling the degrees of freedom between lattices and electrons, orbitals, and spin states. Systematic studies on VO₂, a Mott insulator, have previously revealed that lattice distortion can be manipulated by the interfacial strain and electronic phase separation can emerge. However, typical epitaxial film-substrate interface strain provides a very limited range for exploring such interface-engineered phenomena. Herein, epitaxially grown VO₂ thin films on asymmetrically faceted m-plane sapphire substrates with the hill-and-valley type surfaces have been demonstrated. Interestingly, lattice symmetry breaking has been proven based on the large residual strain from the different faceted planes. By this lattice symmetry breaking, electronic phase separation and metal–insulator transition in the VO₂ films are modulated, and anisotropy in optical responses is exhibited. These results on asymmetrical interfacial engineering in oxide heterostructures open up new routes for novel functional materials design and functional electro/optic device nanofabrication.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanisotropy 3aelectrons 3afilms (materials) 3aphysical properties 3aseparation 0alattice symmetry breaking 0avanadium dioxide 0aepitaxial growth 0asurface 0ainterfacial engineering1 aQi, Zhimin1 aMisra, Shikhar1 aJin, Rongqiang1 aOu, Xin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0316-99581 aLin, Yuan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9879-43411 aYang, Hao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9055-71651 aWang, Haiyan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7397-12090 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2019 Nov. 18, v. 11, no. 47 p.44905-44912dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b164553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02497naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002100146245012100167300002000288520139200308592002801700650001601728650001501744650001301759650001901772650002601791650001801817650003001835650001301865700006501878773013801943856008102081852000902162655001202171IND60756117520221119152221.0211111e20211101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075611752DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c076102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPham, Hanh D. M.10aUnraveling the Origins of Strong and Reversible Chemisorption of Carbon Dioxide in a Green Metal–Organic Framework  ap. 24719-24727.  aCyclodextrin-derived metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) are remarkable not only because of their ability to absorb carbon dioxide strongly and reversibly but also because they can be readily obtained from inexpensive, renewable, and environmentally benign components. Despite the wealth of data on the carbon dioxide intake by CD-MOF-2, a representative of these MOFs, the nature and structural characteristics of its diverse adsorption sites, capable of binding CO₂ in the irreversible, reversible, and weak regimes, remain unclear. A comprehensive analysis of the results of the density functional theory modeling performed in this work in conjunction with experimental data shows that the hydroxyl counterions in CD-MOF-2 pull the protons away from the cyclodextrin alcohol groups, increasing their nucleophilic strength and turning them into strongly binding alkoxide chemisorption sites. At the same time, the diverse hydrogen bonding environments of the alkoxide sites reduce their nucleophilic character to a different extent, tuning their CO₂ binding to become irreversible, reversible, or weak. By linking the acid–base proton equilibrium and hydrogen bonding─two chemical concepts widely used for liquids─to the strength of the CO₂ binding in CD-MOF-2, this work suggests new strategies for advancing design of tunable solid materials for CO₂ capture or detection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLewis bases 3aadsorption 3aalcohols 3acarbon dioxide 3acoordination polymers 3acyclodextrins 3adensity functional theory 3ahydrogen1 aKhaliullin, Rustam Z.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9073-67530 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2021 Nov. 01, v. 125, no. 44 p.24719-24727dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c076103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02639naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001800143245016100161500001400322520146100336592002801797650001601825650002201841650002601863650001301889650001101902650001401913650001101927650000901938700002201947700002001969700001701989700002202006700001902028773013202047856007702179852000902256655001202265IND60732245720221118022347.0210326e20210228xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073224572DNAL7 a10.3390/vetsci80300402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRho, Yoon  Ho10aComparison between Novice and Experienced Surgeons Performing Corrective Osteotomy with Patient-Specific Guides in Dogs Based on Resulting Position Accuracy  aNAL-light  aCorrective osteotomy has been applied to realign and stabilize the bones of dogs with lameness. However, corrective osteotomy for angular deformities requires substantial surgical experience for planning and performing accurate osteotomy. Three-dimensional printed patient-specific guides (3D-PSGs) were developed to overcome perioperative difficulties. In addition, novices can easily use these guides for performing accurate corrective osteotomy. We compared the postoperative results of corrective osteotomy accuracy when using 3D-PSGs in dogs between novice and experienced surgeons. We included eight dogs who underwent corrective osteotomy: three angular deformities of the radius and ulna, three distal femoral osteotomies, one center of rotational angle-based leveling osteotomy, and one corrective osteotomy with stifle arthrodesis. All processes, including 3D bone modeling, production of PSGs, and rehearsal surgery were carried out with computer-aided design software and a 3D-printed bone model. Pre- and postoperative positions following 3D reconstruction were evaluated by radiographs using the 2D/3D registration technique. All patients showed clinical improvement with satisfactory alignment and position. Postoperative accuracy evaluation revealed no significant difference between novice and experienced surgeons. PSGs are thought to be useful for novice surgeons to accurately perform corrective osteotomy in dogs without complications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarthrodesis 3acomputer software 3acomputer-aided design 3alameness 3amodels 3aosteotomy 3astifle 3aulna1 aCho, Cheong  Woon1 aRyu, Chang  Hun1 aLee, Je  Hun1 aJeong, Seong  Mok1 aLee, Hae  Beom0 tVeterinary sciences.g2021 Feb. 28, v. 8, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27139x2306-73817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/vetsci80300403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03798naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245012300168300001600291520194400307592002802251650005302279650001802332650002302350650001602373650000902389650001302398650001302411650001202424650001002436650001002446650001502456650001402471650002402485651001802509653000902527653000802536653000802544653000802552653000702560653000802567653000902575653001102584653000902595653000802604653001102612653000802623653000902631653001402640653001802654653001302672653001602685653002702701653002402728700001902752700002102771700002002792700002102812700002402833700002102857700002402878773010402902856008503006852000903091655001203100IND60606003920221117044235.0181222e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060600392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2016.05.0402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTewar, Shruti10aAssociation of Bisphenol A exposure and Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder in a national sample of U.S. children  ap. 112-118.  aBisphenol A (BPA) has been linked to changes in the dopamine system and development of an Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) phenotype in animal models, with differing effects in males compared to females. We examined the association between urinary BPA concentrations and ADHD in a national sample of U.S. children, and whether this association differs by child sex.We used data from the 2003–2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, a cross-sectional, nationally representative sample of the U.S. population. Participants were 8-15 years of age (N=460). Using a diagnostic interview to ascertain the presence of ADHD in the past year, multivariable logistic regression examined the link between concurrent urinary BPA concentrations and ADHD status.Of the 460 participants, 7.1% [95% CI: 4.4–11.3] met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders – Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) criteria for ADHD. Children who had BPA concentrations at or above the median of the sample had higher prevalence of meeting criteria for ADHD (11.2% [95% CI: 6.8–17.8]) than those with BPA concentrations below the median (2.9% [95% CI: 1.1–7.2]). Higher urinary BPA concentrations were associated with ADHD (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 5.68 [95% CI: 1.6–19.8] for BPA concentrations above vs. below the median). In sex-stratified analyses, these associations were stronger in boys (aOR=10.9 [95% CI: 1.4–86.0]) than in girls (aOR=2.8 [95% CI: 0.4–21.3]), although the BPA by sex interaction term was not significant (p=0.25).We found evidence that higher urinary BPA concentrations were associated with ADHD in U.S. children; these associations were stronger in boys than in girls. Considering the widespread use of BPA and growing literature on neurobehavioral effects of BPA in children, further study is warranted to determine if reducing exposure to BPA may represent an important avenue for ADHD prevention.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 3aanimal models 3abehavior disorders 3abisphenol A 3aboys 3achildren 3adopamine 3afemales 3agirls 3amales 3aodds ratio 3aphenotype 3aregression analysis 3aUnited States 0aADHD 0aACR 0aaOR 0aBPA 0aCI 0aDAT 0aDMAP 0aDSM-IV 0aDISC 0aLOD 0aNHANES 0aPIR 0aADHD 0aAttention 0aHyperactivity 0aBehavior 0aBisphenol A 0aEnvironmental exposure 0aEndocrine disruptor1 aAuinger, Peggy1 aBraun, Joseph M.1 aLanphear, Bruce1 aYolton, Kimberly1 aEpstein, Jeffery N.1 aEhrlich, Shelley1 aFroehlich, Tanya E.0 tEnvironmental research.g2016 Oct., v. 150 p.112-118dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12442x0013-93517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2016.05.0403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02440naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245019500167300001600362520097300378592002801351650004101379650004401420650000901464650001901473650003801492650001501530650002101545650001401566650001601580650002101596653004101617653002101658653005101679700001701730700002101747700001901768700001601787773012401803856008201927852000902009655001202018IND60599844220221120021914.0180702e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059984422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jaap.2013.12.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Souza, A.R.10aFlame retardant properties of the bark powder of Anadenanthera peregrina var. falcata (Benth.)

The TG–DSC and DSC data evidenced that dehydration occurs between 40 and 140°C and that the anhydrous solid is stable up to 195°C, when thermal decomposition begins. Coupled thermogravimetry–Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (TG–FTIR) techniques were used to identify the volatile products evolved during the decomposition of the sample, showing that water and carbon dioxide are the majority products formed by its decomposition even at temperatures as low as 200°C. The strong endothermic peak associated with the release of water provides a reasonable explanation for the fire retardant properties of angico.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnadenanthera peregrina var. falcata 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3abark 3acarbon dioxide 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3aendothermy 3aflame retardants 3apyrolysis 3atemperature 3athermogravimetry 0aAnadenanthera peregrina var. falcata 0aThermal behavior 0aCoupled thermogravimetry-infrared spectroscopy1 aCavassan, O.1 ade Almeida, M.V.1 aLegendre, A.O.1 aBannach, G.0 tJournal of analytical and applied pyrolysis.g2014 Mar., v. 106 p.187-189dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6382x0165-23707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaap.2013.12.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02628naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001500146245011500161300002000276520143400296592002801730650001501758650001301773650002101786650002501807650001201832650001901844650001101863700005601874700001201930700005301942700005501995773013802050856008102188852000902269655001202278IND60756117620221119152326.0211111e20211102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075611762DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c076172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Yaxi10aBalancing Anchoring and Diffusion for Screening of Metal Oxide Cathode Materials in Lithium–Sulfur Batteries  ap. 24318-24327.  aUnfavorable factors such as the shuttle effect caused by soluble lithium polysulfides, insulation of S and Li₂S, and large volume expansion of S have greatly hindered the practical application of lithium–sulfur batteries. Using sulfur cathodes based on metal oxide nanocomposite materials has been proven to be an effective method to overcome the abovementioned problems and accomplish long-term cycle stability, excellent conductivity, and high-rate capacity. However, there is still a lack of clear mechanism research to balance between adsorption and diffusion and speedy selection method for oxides. Herein, we systematically studied the anchoring and diffusion properties of metal oxide MO₂ (TiO₂, SnO₂, and RuO₂) as cathode materials and then screened the materials through the equilibrium mechanism of adsorption and diffusion. According to the abovementioned research, due to its strong interaction with lithium polysulfides and low diffusion barrier for Li⁺, TiO₂ exhibits excellent electrochemical performance and is considered to have great potential as an anchor material for lithium–sulfur batteries. Therefore, a comprehensive metal oxide selection criterion with stronger bonding strength (3–5 eV) and a lower diffusion barrier (<0.4 eV) is proposed. This work provides general guidance for the construction and screening of cathode materials to attain high-performance batteries in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acathodes 3aelectrochemistry 3ainsulating materials 3alithium 3ananocomposites 3asulfur1 aWang, Yanlei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2214-87811 aXia, Yu1 aHuo, Feng1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4397-22401 aHe, Hongyan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1291-27710 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2021 Nov. 02, v. 125, no. 44 p.24318-24327dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c076173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02409naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002100144242012100165245009600286300001600382520114100398592002801539650001601567650001201583650001701595650001201612650002101624650001201645650002101657650001101678650001501689650001001704650001601714651001901730700002001749700002101769700002301790773009901813856007801912852000901990655001201999IND60132726120221119012335.0150511e200701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013272612DNAL7 a10.1051/forest:20060972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLehtonen, Aleksi10aIncertitudes pour l’estimation des facteurs d’expansion de la biomasse chez l’épicéa en République tchèque10aUncertainty estimation of biomass expansion factors for Norway spruce in the Czech Republic  ap. 133-140.  aNation wide estimates of the changes in forest biomass are needed for the greenhouse gas (GHG) reporting under the Climate Convention. The bases for national GHG reporting concerning forest sector are the national forest inventory (NFI) programmes. Since these programmes were mostly established for monitoring of timber resources, one of the current challenges for the NFIs is the development of methodology, such as biomass expansion factors (BEFs). The methodology for carbon stock change estimation should be transparent and verifiable, but this demand is not currently met due to the fact that the source data and uncertainty in the applied BEFs are not known. Here we developed BEFs with uncertainty estimation applicable to stand wise inventory of Norway spruce forests in the Czech Republic. BEFs were constructed, based on tree wise data from permanent research plots, by applying biomass and volume models to tree-level data. These BEFs were age-dependent and their uncertainty was sensitive to the dependencies among errors. Most of the uncertainty in the BEFs was due to uncertainty in the biomass and volume models applied.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPicea abies 3abiomass 3acarbon sinks 3aclimate 3aforest inventory 3aforests 3agreenhouse gases 3amodels 3amonitoring 3atrees 3auncertainty 3aCzech Republic1 aCienciala, Emil1 aTatarinov, Fedor1 aMäkipää, Raisa,0 tAnnals of forest science.g2007 Jan., v. 64, no. 2 p.133-140dSpringer-Verlagx1286-45607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1051/forest:20060973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02218naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245014900169300001500318520115200333592002801485650000801513650001301521650001101534650001601545650001201561650001701573700001901590700001701609700001801626700002001644700002001664773009101684856008401775852000901859655001201868IND60097519220221119180502.0141104e20120601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009751922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enggeo.2012.03.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Hyung-Mok10aField evaluation of permeability of concrete linings and rock masses around underground lined rock caverns by a novel in-situ measurement system  ap. 97-106.  aIn this paper, we introduce a novel in-situ permeability measurement system and present the results of field permeability testing using the developed system. Using a modular structural design and wide measurement range from low to high permeability, the developed system was capable of measuring in-situ scale permeabilities of concrete linings, construction joints and rock mass around excavated rock caverns. Such measurements have been extremely limited so far but are essentially required in estimating the sealing performance of underground storage caverns. The experimental results of a concrete block model test as well as field permeability measurements of concrete linings and the excavation damaged zone (EDZ) around a lined rock cavern (LRC) in a pilot plant for underground compressed air energy storage (CAES) were presented. From these experimental measurements, we could verify the effective applicability of the developed system to a wide range of measurement conditions, from the low permeability concrete lining matrix to the highly permeable construction joints and fractured rock masses around underground rock storage caverns.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aconcrete 3aenergy 3aengineering 3ageology 3apermeability1 aLettry, Yanick1 aPark, Dohyun1 aRyu, Dong-Woo1 aChoi, Byung-Hee1 aSong, Won-Kyong0 tEngineering geology.g2012 June 1, v. 137-138 p.97-106dElsevier B.V.x0013-79527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enggeo.2012.03.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02527naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245011300160300001600273500002000289520137900309592002801688650001201716650001501728650002601743650001401769650001601783650001201799650001601811650001201827650001701839650001701856700002401873700002401897700002201921773011501943856007402058852000902132655001202141IND60588233220221116142938.0180103e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058823322DNAL7 a10.1111/febs.139642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNoor, Sina Ibne10aIntegration of a ‘proton antenna’ facilitates transport activity of the monocarboxylate transporter MCT4  ap. 149-162.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aMonocarboxylate transporters (MCTs) mediate the proton‐coupled transport of high‐energy metabolites like lactate and pyruvate and are expressed in nearly every mammalian tissue. We have shown previously that transport activity of MCT4 is enhanced by carbonic anhydrase II (CAII), which has been suggested to function as a ‘proton antenna’ for the transporter. In the present study, we tested whether creation of an endogenous proton antenna by introduction of a cluster of histidine residues into the C‐terminal tail of MCT4 (MCT4‐6xHis) could facilitate MCT4 transport activity when heterologously expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Our results show that integration of six histidines into the C‐terminal tail does indeed increase transport activity of MCT4 to the same extent as did coexpression of MCT4‐WT with CAII. Transport activity of MCT4‐6xHis could be further enhanced by coexpression with extracellular CAIV, but not with intracellular CAII. Injection of an antibody against the histidine cluster into MCT4‐expressing oocytes decreased transport activity of MCT4‐6xHis, while leaving activity of MCT4‐WT unaltered. Taken together, these findings suggest that transport activity of the proton‐coupled monocarboxylate transporter MCT4 can be facilitated by integration of an endogenous proton antenna into the transporter’s C‐terminal tail.  aPublisher supplied data 3aXenopus 3aantibodies 3acarbonate dehydratase 3ahistidine 3alactic acid 3amammals 3ametabolites 3aoocytes 3apyruvic acid 3atransporters1 aPouyssegur, Jacques1 aDeitmer, Joachim W.1 aBecker, Holger M.0 tFEBS journal.g2017 Jan., v. 284, no. 1 p.149-162dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3943524x1742-464X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/febs.139643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03319naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001300166245015500179300001800334520131200352592002801664650001001692650001301702650002001715650001001735650000901745650001401754650001101768650000901779650000901788650002301797650001201820650001401832650001301846650002101859650003201880650005701912650002401969650002401993650001102017650003202028650002202060650001102082650001402093650002502107650004302132650000902175650001402184650007702198650003902275651001002314651002502324700001802349700001502367700001702382700001402399700001402413700001702427700001402444773008502458856008102543852000902624655001202633IND50069084920221120191431.0141112e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006908492DNAL7 a240120862pmid7 a10.1016/j.nut.2013.03.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Ke10aEffect of simultaneous supplementation of vitamin A and iron on diarrheal and respiratory tract infection in preschool children in Chengdu City, China  ap. 1197-1203.  aOBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to investigate whether vitamin A combined with iron supplementation for preschool children resulted in improved changes in children's infectious morbidity. METHOD: In this randomized placebo-controlled and blinded field intervention trial, totally 445 preschoolers, ages 3 to 6 y old, were randomly selected. All children were randomly divided into four groups: vitamin A supplement-only group (group I), iron supplement-only group (group II), vitamin A and iron supplement group (group III), and no vitamin A and ferrous sulfate as placebo-control (group IV) for 6 mo. The morbidity of diarrhea and respiratory infections, were collected during supplementation. RESULTS: There was evidence of the lowest incidence rate of respiratory-related illnesses and fewest symptoms of runny nose, cough, and fever for children in group III compared with children in groups I, II and IV (P < 0.05). Moreover, despite the undistinguished incidence rate of vomiting, nausea, and stomach pain, the rate of diarrhea-related illness was significantly lower for children in group III than for those in the other three groups.

The veterinarians involved in herds skin testing were solicited to participate to the survey (n = 94), through an anonymous postal questionnaire including items related to each step of the skin test procedure. Each item of the questionnaire was allotted a compliance score by 5 experts in the field of bovine tuberculosis (0, 1 or 2 a correct, acceptable and unacceptable answer, respectively). These scores were balanced over 30 criteria according to their potential impact on the non‐detection of reactors, on the basis of 11 experts’ opinion. A global score was calculated for each participating veterinarian. In addition, the Departmental sanitary authorities held meetings in December 2005 and June 2006 to make the veterinarians aware of the importance of correctly performing the skin test. The participants to the study were asked to fill in the questionnaire in duplicate: one related to their practices before the meeting, and the other one focusing on their practices after the meeting. A comparison of both situations was carried out (pre‐ and post‐awareness meeting), as well as a comparison with the Belgian situation, arbitrarily selected as reference for the methodology. The participation was representative and reached a 23.4% rate. A significant difference was noticed between the mean global score reached before and after the meeting. These results show the usefulness of an appropriate awareness campaign of veterinarians in relation to skin testing and the importance of frequently holding awareness meetings in areas remaining confronted with bovine tuberculosis problems. It also highlights the interest of a structured auto‐assessment process of veterinary practices.  aPublisher supplied data 3abovine tuberculosis 3acattle 3acompliance 3aexercise test 3aexpert opinion 3aexperts 3aherds 3aquestionnaires 3askin tests 3asurveys 3aveterinarians 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aCommunicable Diseases, Emergingxepidemiologyxveterinary. 2aEducation, Veterinary 2aSurveys and Questionnaires. 2aSkin Testsxveterinary 2aTuberculosis, Bovinexdiagnosisxepidemiology. 2aVeterinarians 3aBelgium 3aFrance 0aBelgium 0aFrancexepidemiology.1 aMoyen, J.‐L.1 aBardoux, P.1 aBoschiroli, M.

The as-synthesized samples were systematically characterized by XRD, SEM, TEM, EDS, BET, XPS, FR-IR, UV–vis DRS, photoelectrochemical measurements and EPR. The formation mechanism of the new composite photocataslyts was investigated and the simulate formation process had been illustrated. The photocatalytic properties of the samples were evaluated by degradation of methyl orange under visible-light irradiation. The results shown that the 30% Ag-AgI/BiOI-Bi2O3 photocataslyts possessed the best photocatalytic activity and the kinetics reaction models were followed pseudo-first-order kinetics. The enhanced photocatalytic performance could be attributed to the effective separation and transfer of electron–hole pairs resulting by the deposing of Ag-AgI nanoparticles and Bi2O3. The photocatalytic mechanism was deduced by trapping experiments and EPR, and the results demonstrated that h+, OH, O2− radicals played different roles in the degradation. Furthermore, a new Z-scheme multi-heterojunction mechanism was proposed basing on the results of trapping experiments and EPR.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3abismuth 3aelectron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3afree radicals 3aiodides 3airradiation 3amethyl orange 3amodels 3ananoparticles 3aphotocatalysis 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asilver 3asuperoxide anion 3atransmission electron microscopy 0aAg-AgI 0aBiOI 0aBi2O3 0aPhotocataslyts 0aZ-scheme mechanism1 aXie, Xin1 aLiu, Yonggang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1114-50831 aWang, Shenbo1 aZhang, Menghan1 aChen, Yongyang1 aSi, Yushan0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2019 June 05, v. 371 p.304-315dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2019.03.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03227naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001700112245009800129300001600227520193300243592002802176650002102204650001702225650001502242650001202257650001202269650001102281650002402292650001502316650001902331650001502350650001802365650002902383650000902412650002402421650002102445651001002466653002302476653003102499653001902530700001802549700002102567700002202588773015002610852000902760655001202769IND60706518220221119033253.0210117e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070651822DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDesai, Harsh10aExtent of Adoption of Recommended Hybrid Castors Cultivation Technology by the Castor Growers  ap. 346-349.  aOilseed crops occupy an important place in Indian economy next to food grains. India ranks first in the world in respect of area, production and productivity of castor crop during 2009–2010 as 8.59 lack hectares areas, 11.90 lack tones production and 1385 kg/ha productivity (Anon., 2011a). Castor being one of the important oilseed crop in Sabarkantha district. The area under hybrid castor in this district was 1, 47, 425 hectares with a production about 1, 25, 700 Metric tones and productivity of 1712 kg/ha during 2010–2011 (Anon., 2011). But the harvested yield of castor crop in the research station was recorded as 2230 to 3000 kg/ha. The study was conducted in three talukas of Sabarkantha districts in the year 2011–12. The majority of castor growers were found in medium level of category with respect to age (57.50%), land holding (89.17%), annual income (59.17%), extension contact (58.33%), sources of information (69.17%), economic motivation (70.83%), scientific orientation (67.50%), risk preference (76.66%) and level of knowledge (69.17%). Further, The majority (62.50%) of castor growers were educated from primary to secondary school, (64.17%) were having tube-well irrigation facility, (90%) were having membership in social organization and (80%) were having medium to high level of innovativeness. Majority of the castor growers (67.50%) were having medium level of adoption of recommended hybrid castor cultivation technology. The results of correlation analysis indicated that out of 13 independent variables, eleven independent variables viz.; education, land holding, annual income, social participation, extension contact, sources of information, economic motivation, scientific orientation, Risk preference, innovativeness and knowledge level were found positively and significantly correlated with extent of adoption of recommended hybrid castor cultivation technology by the castor growers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRicinus communis 3acastor beans 3acrop yield 3agrowers 3ahybrids 3aincome 3ainformation sources 3airrigation 3aland ownership 3amotivation 3aoilseed crops 3aparticipation (behavior) 3arisk 3asecondary education 3asocial structure 3aIndia 0aExtent of adoption 0aHybrid castors cultivation 0aCastor growers1 aSheikh, A.

The substrate and product were separated by CE in short-end injection mode within 2min. Dual-wavelength ultraviolet detection was employed to eliminate the interference from the screened compounds. The parameters relating to the separation efficiency and the activity of immobilized neuraminidase were systematically evaluated. The activity of the immobilized neuraminidase remained 90% after 30 days storage at 4°C. The immobilized NA microreactor could be continuously used for more than 200 runs. The Michaelis–Menten constant of neuraminidase was determined by the microreactor as 136.6±10.8μM. In addition, six in eighteen natural products were found as potent inhibitors and the inhibition potentials were ranked in the following order: bavachinin>bavachin>baicalein>baicalin>chrysin and vitexin. The half-maximal inhibitory concentrations were 59.52±4.12, 65.28±1.07, 44.79±1.21 and 31.62±2.04 for baicalein, baicalin, bavachin and bavachinin, respectively.

However, population trends vary greatly among regions, with those on the east coast of Scotland and in the Northern Isles experiencing dramatic declines since the early 2000s and populations on the west coast being either stable or increasing. The reasons for these differences in population dynamics are unknown. Determining whether there has been a change in somatic growth among populations can assist in assessing potential causes for abundance declines, as shifts in juvenile growth rates or maximum length at maturity may indicate changes in environmental conditions. Resource limitations are likely to result in slower growth and later age at sexual maturity, whereas causes of acute mortality could have the opposite effect. Here, analysis of the most comprehensive length‐at‐age dataset for UK harbour seals found no evidence for major differences, or changes over time, in asymptotic length or growth parameters from fitted von Bertalanffy growth curves, across all regions, with the exception of one pairwise comparison; males from East Scotland were significantly shorter than males from all other areas by an average of almost 9 cm. However, the power to detect small changes was limited by measurement uncertainty and differences in spatial and temporal sampling effort. Asymptotic lengths at maturity across all regions were slightly lower than published lengths for harbour seal populations in Europe, the Arctic, and Canada, with females being on average 140.5 cm (95% confidence interval 139.4, 141.6 cm) and males 149.4 cm (95% confidence interval 147.8, 151.1 cm) at adulthood. Reliable estimates of changes in growth over time are important for understanding environmental constraints on a population, but knowledge of the underlying drivers of change is essential for the design of robust conservation and mitigation plans.  aPublisher supplied data  aMMSS/001/11cMarine Scotland  aSMRU/10001cNatural Environment Research Council  cScottish Natural Heritage 3aPhoca vitulina 3aadulthood 3acoasts 3aconfidence interval 3adata collection 3adisease outbreaks 3aenvironmental factors 3afemales 3agrowth curves 3ajuveniles 3amales 3amortality 3apopulation dynamics 3asexual maturity 3auncertainty 3aArctic region 3aCanada 3aScotland1 aMackey, Beth1 aKershaw, Joanna L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2244-31981 aThompson, Paul1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6195-32840 tAquatic conservation.g2019 Sept., v. 29 Suppl S1 p.61-70dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl51367x1052-76137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/aqc.31043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03399naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245012300166300001800289520198600307592002802293650003102321650002002352650002202372650001302394650001002407650001502417650001402432650001502446650001002461650001902471650001502490650000902505650002602514650001102540650002902551700001902580700002302599700002002622700002002642700001902662700003002681773012802711856008102839852000902920655001202929IND60438667920221118195617.0151023e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043866792DNAL7 a10.1007/s00253-015-6653-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Wen-Xuan10aHexacyclopeptides secreted by an endophytic fungus Fusarium solani N06 act as crosstalk molecules in Narcissus tazetta  ap. 7651-7662.  aThe basis of chemical crosstalk in plants and associated endophytes lies in certain so-called communication molecules that are responsible for plant-microbe and microbe-microbe interactions. Consequently, elucidating the factors that affect the nature, distribution, and amount of these molecules and how they impact the interaction among endophytes and associated organisms is essential to understand the true potential of endophytes. In the present study, we report the discovery of nine hexacyclopeptides from an endophytic fungus, Fusarium solani, isolated from the bulb of Narcissus tazetta, and their selective accumulation by an endophytic bacterium, Achromobacter xylosoxidans isolated from the same tissue. We used matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization imaging high-resolution mass spectrometry (MALDI-imaging-HRMS) to firstly identify and visualize the spatial distribution of the hexacyclopeptides produced by endophytic F. solani. After culture condition optimization, their sequence was identified to be cyclo((Hyp or Dhp)-Xle-Xle-(Ala or Val)-Thr-Xle) (Dhp: dehydroproline) by the characteristic a, b, or y ions using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-HRMSⁿ). These hexacyclopeptides were confirmed to be fungal biosynthetic products by deuterium labeling experiments. Finally, in order to understand the plausible ecological relevance of one or more of the discovered hexacyclopeptides within the contexts of microbial “neighbor communication,” we devised a dual-culture setup to visualize using MALDI-imaging-HRMS how the hexacyclopeptides released by the endophytic fungus are accumulated by another endophytic bacterium, A. xylosoxidans, isolated from the same bulb tissue. This work exemplifies the relevance of cyclopeptides in endophyte-endophyte interspecies neighbor communication occurring in nature. Such communication strategies are evolved by coexisting endophytes to survive and function in their distinct ecological niches.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAchromobacter xylosoxidans 3aFusarium solani 3aNarcissus tazetta 3abacteria 3abulbs 3adesorption 3adeuterium 3aendophytes 3afungi 3aimage analysis 3aionization 3aions 3aliquid chromatography 3aniches 3atandem mass spectrometry1 aKusari, Souvik1 aSezgin, Selahaddin1 aLamshöft, Marc1 aKusari, Parijat1 aKayser, Oliver1 aSpiteller, M.q(Michael),0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2015 Sept., v. 99, no. 18 p.7651-7662dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0175-75987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-015-6653-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02520naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001600149245009100165300001600256520128600272592002801558650001101586650001901597650001901616650001601635650002201651650001201673650001501685650002901700650001101729650002101740650002901761650002501790651001001815653003001825653002701855653002501882700002101907773007801928856008302006852000902089655001202098IND60546199820221121040800.0160903e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054619982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2014.09.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOshiro, Ken10aDiffusion of low emission vehicles and their impact on CO2 emission reduction in Japan  ap. 215-225.  aIn order to achieve the long-term CO2 emission reduction target in Japan, diffusion of low emission vehicles can contribute by integration of intermittent renewable energy by demand side management using low emission vehicles, such as smart charging battery electric vehicle (BEV), in addition to improvement of energy efficiency and carbon intensity. In this study, impact of the low emission vehicles is assessed using AIM/Enduse model with 10 regions in Japan. The model is revised to integrate power generation sector and to separate the transportation demand into small, medium and large size vehicles in order to reflect the availability of BEV and fuel-cell electric vehicle (FCEV) in each vehicle size. In the Reference case, hybrid vehicle accounts for more than a half of transport demand in 2050. However, by introducing the carbon tax to achieve the 2 degree target, the share of both BEV and FCEV in 2050 reaches around 90% and 60% in passenger and freight transport, respectively. In addition, electricity demand pattern is transformed by demand side management in 2050 while integrating more intermittent renewable energy into electricity system. As a result, the CO2 emissions from transport sector in 2050 decreases by approximately 81% compared to the 1990 level.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon markets 3aelectricity 3aenergy efficiency 3afreight 3afuel cells 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3amodels 3apower generation 3arenewable energy sources 3avehicles (equipment) 3aJapan 0aClimate change mitigation 0aDemand side management 0aLow emission vehicle1 aMasui, Toshihiko0 tEnergy Policy.g2015 June, v. 81 p.215-225dElsevier Ltdx0301-42157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2014.09.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03166naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245019100167300001600358520151400374592002801888650001201916650001601928650001401944650002101958650002101979650001702000650001302017650002402030650001002054650004202064650001302106650001202119650001802131650002602149650001302175650001402188650001302202650001802215650000902233650001302242653003102255653002702286653002402313653001302337653000902350700001302359700001502372700001602387773011402403856008602517852000902603655001202612IND60634623920221117233920.0190725e20190605xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063462392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2019.03.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yang10aMicrobial mechanism underlying high and stable methane oxidation rates during mudflat reclamation with long-term rice cultivation: Illumina high-throughput sequencing-based data analysis  ap. 332-341.  aThis study aimed to determine the methane oxidation rates (MOR), pmoA gene abundance and diversity, and microbial community composition using Illumina high-throughput sequencing. Mudflats located within Yancheng City, divided into different plots with 0-, 11-, and 20-year successive rice planting histories, were selected and sampled. The study found that the relative MOR (normalized with the 16S rRNA gene) increased dramatically after 11-year cultivation and remained stable in 20-year treatment, indicating that long-term rice cultivation in mudflats promoted MOR. The sequencing data analysis revealed that high MOR was related to the synergistic growth of methane-producing archaea (MPA) and aerobic and facultative methane-consuming bacteria (MCB) mainly belonging to Proteobacteria. Redundancy and correlation analyses showed that Methylophilaceae and Methylococcaceae affiliated within β- and γ-Proteobacterial methanotrophs were closely related to the relative MOR. Methane-oxidizing archaea (MOA) coupled to sulfate and nitrite reductions contributed more to the high and stable MOR compared with Proteobacterial MCB. Chloroflexi and Geobacter were the potential hydrogen donors for hydrogenotrophic MPA. The results showed that long-term rice cultivation in mudflats promoted the relative MOR. The unknown MOA coupled to sulfate and nitrite reductions, besides the necessary hydrogenotrophic MPA and their hydrogen donors (Chloroflexi and Geobacter) collectively contributed to methane cycling.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArchaea 3aChloroflexi 3aGeobacter 3aMethylococcaceae 3aMethylophilaceae 3aOryza sativa 3abacteria 3acommunity structure 3agenes 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3ahydrogen 3amethane 3amethanotrophs 3amicrobial communities 3anitrites 3aoxidation 3aplanting 3aribosomal RNA 3arice 3asulfates 0aLong-term rice cultivation 0aMethane oxidation rate 0aMicrobial community 0aMudflats 0apmoA1 aLi, Qing1 aDai, Qigen1 aKang, Yijun0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2019 June 05, v. 371 p.332-341dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2019.03.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01930naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100001800181245012800199300002000327506007600347520050800423592002800931506003700959650000800996650000801004650002301012650002301035650002601058650002201084650002601106650002101132650002201153700002101175700001601196700002401212700002001236700002001256773013701276856007401413852000901487655001201496IND60660700320221207084926.0190827e20140930xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066070032DNAL7 a10.1039/c4cc05771f2doi7 aPMC41839922pmcid7 a252132242pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLietard, Jory10aBase-cleavable microarrays for the characterization of DNA and RNA oligonucleotides synthesized in situ by photolithography  ap. 12903-12906.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAssessing synthesis efficiency, errors, failed deprotections, and chemical and enzymatic degradation of oligonucleotides on microarrays is essential for improving existing in situ synthesis methods, and for the development of new chemistries.

Ionic liquids complement conventional stationary phases because of a combination of thermophysical and solvation properties that only exist for ionic solvents. Their high thermal stability and low vapor pressure makes them suitable as polar stationary phases for separations requiring high temperatures. Ionic liquids are good solvents and can be used to expand the chemical space for separations. They are the only stationary phases with significant hydrogen-bond acidity in common use; they extend the hydrogen-bond basicity of conventional stationary phases; they are as dipolar/polarizable as the most polar conventional stationary phases; and some ionic liquids are significantly less cohesive than conventional polar stationary phases. Problems in column coating techniques and related low column performance, column activity, and stationary phase reactivity require further exploration as the reasons for these features are poorly understood at present.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidity 3acoatings 3acomplement 3agas chromatography 3ahydrogen bonding 3aionic liquids 3atemperature 3athermal stability 3avapor pressure 0aIonic liquids 0aStationary phases 0aGas chromatography 0aThermophysical properties 0aColumn characterization 0aSolvation parameter model1 aLenca, Nicole0 tJournal of chromatography.g2014 Aug. 29, v. 1357 p.87-109dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl50504x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2014.03.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02337naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245011500168300001600283520101300299592002801312650001501340650001401355650002201369650001801391653002301409653002201432653002301454653001701477653001701494653001801511653002201529700003601551700002201587700001601609700002901625700003401654700002601688773011001714856008201824852000901906655001201915IND60606673220221117235450.0180727e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060667322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.trac.2015.10.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJamshaid, Talha10aMagnetic particles: From preparation to lab-on-a-chip, biosensors, microsystems and microfluidics applications  ap. 344-362.  aMagnetic particles are largely used in various applications and particularly in in-vitro biomedical diagnostic and bionanotechnology.

Nowadays, they are also successfully being exploited as a carrier of biomolecules in microsystems, microfluidics, lab-on-a-chip and for detection in specific biosensors. Before any use or any preparation of magnetic hybrid particles, various factors should be considered in order to perfectly target the suitable applications. For instance, in case of nucleic acid, the particles shouldn't induce any inhibition of biological amplification techniques. For microfluidic, these particles should be colloidal stable in order to avoid any jump in the microfluidic canals.

The results showed that significantly higher plant height recorded at 60 DAS and at harvest except at 30 DAS, number of branches plant⁻¹, days to 50 per cent flowering, days to maturity, harvest index, seed yield and stover yield, protein content and highest net realization were registered under treatment I₄ (Irrigation at 0.8 IW: CPE ratio) followed by treatment I₃ (Irrigation at branching + flowering + pod formation + seed filling) and I₂. All these characters were higher under level of zinc application 12.5 kg ZnSO₄ ha⁻¹. Results regarding interaction effect of irrigation schedules and application of zinc revealed that the treatment combination I₄Zn1 (Irrigation at 0.8 IW: CPE ratio along with application of Zn @ 12.5 kg ZnSO₄ ha⁻¹ recorded significantly higher seed yield, stover yield and net realization.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVigna unguiculata 3abranches 3abranching 3acowpeas 3afield experimentation 3afilling period 3aflowering 3aharvest index 3aiodine 3airrigation scheduling 3aloamy sand soils 3apH 3aplant height 3aprotein content 3aseed yield 3astover 3asummer 3atexture 3azinc 3azinc sulfate 3aIndia 0aCowpea 0aIWCPE ratio and Zinc1 aPatel, J.

The Content of QB-Protein, Cytochrome f, and P-700  ap. 589-595.  aIn order to obtain an insight into the damage of thylakoid membranes of spruce (Picea abies) trees with damage of varying intensity, investigations were performed on the content of Qв-protein, cytochrome f, and P-700 in chloroplasts of spruce needles from apparently healthy and from damaged trees. Needles from the second and third needle year and the seventh whorl were chosen. The investigations were carried out in 1986 on a 20 to 25-year-old spruce plantation in the Hunsriick mountains and on an 80-year-old spruce plantation in the Westerwald mountains. In damaged trees an unequivocal decrease in the content of Qв-protein, cytochrome f, and P-700 was found, even in needle groups that appear visibly green and healthy. The amount of cytochrome f decreased by 25% per dry weight (approximately to the same extent as chlorophyll); the content of Qв-protein and P-700, however, were more drastically reduced compared to the control trees (about 40% and 50%, respectively). These results of measuring the photosynthetic electron transport components imply that the thylakoid membranes are sites of early injurious effects.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPicea abies 3aadverse effects 3achlorophyll 3acytochrome f 3aelectron transfer 3aforest decline 3amountains 3aphotosynthesis 3athylakoids 3atrees 0aAir Pollution 0aCytochrome f 0aNovel Forest Decline 0aPicea abies 0aThylakoid Membrane Damage1 aFlammersfeld, Ute1 aMoors, Iris1 aDietz, Bernhard1 aRühle, Wolfgang0 tZeitschrift für Naturforschung.g2014 June 2, v. 43, no. 7-8 p.589-595dVerlag der Zeitschrift für NaturforschungwJournal:23183x1865-71257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/znc-1988-7-8173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02672naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245013800163300002000301520111600321592002801437650002201465650001401487650002301501650002001524650003401544650001301578650001001591650003301601650001701634650001801651650001501669650001301684650001801697650001401715650003301729650001101762650002301773650003701796700002301833700002401856700003401880700003101914700002601945773012401971856007402095852000902169655001202178IND60642096120221119041150.0190506e20170825xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064209612DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ra07434d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchneider, Ricardo10aLead–germanate glasses: an easy growth process for silver nanoparticles and their promising applications in photonics and catalysis  ap. 41479-41485.  aIn this study, we report non-conventional silver nanoparticle growth on the surface of lead–germanate oxide glasses. Thermal annealing at around the glass transition temperature (Tg) under a nitrogen atmosphere enables the growth of silver thin films on the glass surface. The nanoparticle growth was monitored by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and UV-visible spectroscopy as a function of the annealing time. The characteristic temperatures were obtained by differential thermal analysis (DTA) and the influence of the Ag⁺ ion content on the glass stability (GS) parameters was evaluated. Additionally, the apparent activation energy of crystallization (E) was calculated. The silver thin films obtained after different annealing times were applied as a substrate for luminescence enhancement of the Eu(btfa)₃·bipy rare earth europium complex. The catalytic activity of the Ag-doped glasses was tested for the reduction of p-nitrophenol in the presence of NaBH₄. The catalytic performance of the unannealed glass demonstrated an unexpected good efficiency compared with the annealed glass samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivation energy 3aannealing 3acatalytic activity 3acrystallization 3adifferential thermal analysis 3aeuropium 3aglass 3aglass transition temperature 3aluminescence 3ananoparticles 3ananosilver 3anitrogen 3ap-nitrophenol 3aphotonics 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asilver 3asodium borohydride 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy1 aSchneider, Rodrigo1 ade Campos, Elvio A.1 aSantos Mendes, Joaquim Bonfim1 aFelix, Jorlandio Francisco1 aSanta-Cruz, Petrus A.0 tRSC advances.g2017 Aug. 25, v. 7, no. 66 p.41479-41485dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ra07434d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03015naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100001700181245012000198300002000318506007600338520158700414592002802001506003702029650003702066650001502103650000802118650002802126650002302154650001802177650001902195650001902214650001102233650001002244650002702254650001702281650001902298700002202317700002302339773012402362856007402486852000902560655001202569IND60642096220221207045927.0190506e20170728xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064209622DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ra07435b2doi7 aPMC57083612pmcid7 a293081882pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Tung-Yi10aStability of UV/ozone-treated thermoplastics under different storage conditions for microfluidic analytical devices  ap. 37374-37379.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThermoplastics are becoming a popular material for fabricating microfluidic devices and there is an increasing need for robust surface modification strategies. UV/ozone (UVO) treatment is a simple and effective method for making plastic surfaces more hydrophilic. Prior reports on the stability of UVO-treated plastics are limited to four weeks, which is not sufficient for applications requiring long-term storage. Here, we present new findings on the long-term stability of UVO-treated plastics for up to 16 weeks and show that the storage condition has a significant impact on the surface stability. Static contact angle measurements, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) were performed on UVO-treated cyclic olefin copolymer (COC), polycarbonate (PC) and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) stored in air, dehumidified and vacuum conditions. We found that the hydrophobic recovery of UVO-treated COC and PC can be inhibited by storing them in dehumidified or vacuum conditions, whereas the stability of PMMA is not significantly influenced by the storage condition. Protein adsorption studies were carried out and showed that there is a significant reduction in the amount of protein adsorption on UVO-treated plastics compared with untreated plastics. Lastly, UVO-treated PMMA microchannels were fabricated and used for capillary-driven flow, which revealed that longer treatment durations generate faster flow rates. These collective results offer new insights into the utility of UVO-treated plastics for microfluidic analytical applications.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aadsorption 3aair 3aatomic force microscopy 3acomposite polymers 3acontact angle 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3aolefin 3aozone 3apolymethylmethacrylate 3astorage time 3athermoplastics1 aPfeiffer, Trey T.1 aLillehoj, Peter B.0 tRSC advances.g2017 July 28, v. 7, no. 59 p.37374-37379dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ra07435b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03779naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245013100170300001600301520167500317536038301992592002802375596009202403596010002495596008602595650002102681650002402702650001202726650001302738650001202751650001502763650001502778650001102793650001302804650001102817650001402828651001002842653002102852653001202873653001602885653001702901653002502918653002702943700002402970700002302994700002703017773012203044856008603166852000903252655001203261IND60524346320221119213546.0190501e20160303xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052434632DNAL7 a10.1080/17550874.2016.11760802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPato, Joaquina10aExperimental evidence from Cantabrian mountain heathlands suggests new recommendations for management of Vaccinium myrtillus L  ap. 199-206.  aBackground: Management actions in mountain heathlands oriented to increasing the cover of Vaccinium myrtillus promote mowing of Calluna vulgaris to avoid competition. However, such action ignores the fact that plant–plant interactions range from competition to facilitation under different stress conditions. Aims: To test whether the interactions between these two species are related to competition or facilitation, which would change the perspective for their management in mountain heathlands. Methods: A total of 40 experimental plots located in a montane heathland (northern Spain) were selected. Calluna or Vaccinium plants were either cut at ground level or not cut, and plots were fertilized with nitrogen or not in a three-factorial design. Vegetative and reproductive shoot mass and length of the current year’s shoots were estimated in two consecutive years for both species. Herbivory on Vaccinium by browsing ungulates was compared in control plots and plots where Calluna had been cut 2 yrs ago. Results: The two study species co-occurred in 72.4% of the sampled plots, although Calluna was more abundant. Vaccinium growth was greater in plots with Calluna than in plots where Calluna had been cut. Browsing on Vaccinium was also higher in plots were Calluna had been cut, and the effect of fertilization was only significant on the reproductive biomass of Calluna. Conclusions: Contrary to initial proposals, our results suggest that Vaccinium does not always benefit from the cutting of Calluna in heathlands. Thus, the management of Cantabrian mountain heathlands should consider maintaining Calluna in order to facilitate the growth of Vaccinium.  aThis study was supported by the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation under project [MICINN-09-CGL2009-11302] to JRO, grant [PFPU AP2006-00116] to JP]; the Foundation for Promotion in Asturias of Applied and Technological Scientific Research grant [BP08-047] to EFP; the European Social Fund and the state budget of the Czech Republic grant [CZ.1.07/2.3.00/30.0037] to BJA.  aPublisher supplied data  aCZ.1.07/2.3.00/30.0037cEuropean Social Fund and the State Budget of the Czech Republic  aBP08-047cFoundation for Promotion in Asturias of Applied and Technological Scientific Research  aAP2006-00116aMICINN-09-CGL2009-11302cSpanish Ministry of Science and Innovation 3aCalluna vulgaris 3aVaccinium myrtillus 3abiomass 3abrowsing 3acutting 3aheathlands 3aherbivores 3amowing 3anitrogen 3ashoots 3aungulates 3aSpain 0aCalluna vulgaris 0acutting 0acompetition 0afacilitation 0aheathland management 0anitrogen fertilization1 aObeso, José Ramón1 aPloquin, Emilie F.1 aJiménez-Alfaro, Borja0 tPlant ecology & diversity.g2016 Mar. 3, v. 9, no. 2 p.199-206dTaylor & FranciswJournal:J000000135x1755-16687nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17550874.2016.11760803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03391naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100005800138245005900196300001400255500002000269520202200289592002802311596004102339596003002380650001902410650001902429650001102448650002202459650001402481650001202495650002402507650002002531650001002551650001202561650001302573651001202586651001402598651001302612700002002625700002102645700006502666773012102731856007202852852000902924655001202933IND60663193920221119220222.0190909e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066319392DNAL7 a10.1002/aqc.31102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThompson, Dave1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1546-287614aThe status of harbour seals (Phoca vitulina) in the UK  ap. 40-60.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aEstimates of population size and trends are essential for effective conservation and management of wildlife populations. For harbour seals (Phoca vitulina), these data are required to fulfil statutory reporting obligations under national and international regulations. Aerial survey counts of harbour seals hauled out during their annual moult were used to estimate population sizes and trends at UK, regional (seal management unit, SMU) and local (Special Area of Conservation, SAC) scales. Results indicate that the current UK harbour seal population is similar to estimates from the late 1990s, but there were significant declines in some subpopulations and increases in others. Fitted trends suggest that the UK harbour seal population can be divided into three geographically coherent groups: South‐east populations (South‐East and North‐East England SMUs) have shown continuous increases punctuated by phocine distemper virus epidemics in 1988 and 2002; north‐east populations (East Scotland, Moray Firth, North Coast and Orkney, and Shetland SMUs) have declined since the late 1990s; north‐west populations (West Scotland, Western Isles, and South‐West Scotland SMUs) have remained stable or increased. Similar geographical population substructure is evident in recent population genetics results. Trends within SACs generally match SMU trends since 2002. Of the nine SACs designated for harbour seals, four declined (in East Scotland, Moray Firth, and North Coast and Orkney SMUs), four remained stable (in Shetland and West Scotland SMUs), and one increased (in South‐East England SMU). Large changes in relative abundance have resulted from differences in regional trends. For example, in 1996–1997 the West Scotland and North Coast and Orkney SMUs each held ~27% of the Great Britain population but now hold ~50% and ~4% respectively; in 1980, the South‐East England SMU population was ~50% that of the Wadden Sea population, but by 2016 it was equivalent to <20% of the Wadden Sea count.  aPublisher supplied data  cNatural Environment Research Council  cScottish Natural Heritage 3aPhoca vitulina 3aaerial surveys 3acoasts 3adisease outbreaks 3adistemper 3amolting 3apopulation genetics 3apopulation size 3aseals 3aviruses 3awildlife 3aEngland 3aNorth Sea 3aScotland1 aDuck, Callan D.1 aMorris, Chris D.1 aRussell, Debbie J.

Previous research focused on these proteins, primarily as extracellular matrix (ECM) protein‐degrading enzymes which allowed cancer cells to breach the basement membrane and invade surrounding tissue. However, recently, there has been a shift in the view of cell surface proteases, including serine proteases, as proteolytic modifiers of particular targets, including growth factors and protease‐activated receptors, which are critical for the activation of oncogenic signaling pathways. Of the 176 human serine proteases currently identified, a subset of 17, known as type II transmembrane serine proteases (TTSPs). Many have been shown to be relevant to cancer progression since they were first identified as a family around the turn of the century. To this end, altered expression of TTSPs appeared as a trademark of several tumor types. However, the substrates and underlying signaling pathways remained unclear. Localization of these proteins to the cell surface places them in the unique position to mediate signal transduction between the cell and its surrounding environment. Many of the TTSPs have already been shown to play key roles in processes such as postnatal development, tissue homeostasis, and tumor progression, which share overlapping molecular mechanisms. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge regarding the role of the TTSP family in pro‐oncogenic signaling.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abasement membrane 3acarcinogenesis 3adisease course 3aextracellular matrix 3agrowth factors 3ahomeostasis 3ahumans 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3apostnatal development 3aproteolysis 3areceptors 3aserine proteinases 3asignal transduction1 aList, Karin0 tFEBS journal.g2017 May, v. 284, no. 10 p.1421-1436dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3943524x1742-464X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/febs.139713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02321naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245007900163300001800242500001100260520129400271592002801565650001201593650001401605650001301619650001301632650002801645650001601673650001401689650002301703650001301726700003201739773011701771856007401888852000901962655001201971IND60588233920221116143047.0180103e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058823392DNAL7 a10.1111/febs.140342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSueldo, Daniela J.10aPlant life needs cell death, but does plant cell death need Cys proteases?  ap. 1577-1585.  aREVIEW  aCaspases are key regulators of apoptosis in animals. This correlation has driven plant researchers for decades to look for caspases regulating programmed cell death (PCD) in plants. These studies revealed caspase‐like activities, caspase‐related proteases, and cysteine (Cys) proteases regulating PCD in plants, but identified no caspases and no conserved, apoptosis‐like death pathway. Here, we critically review the evidence for Cys proteases implicated in PCD in plants. We discuss the role of papain‐like Cys proteases, vacuolar processing enzymes, and metacaspases in PCD during the development of tracheary elements, seed coat, suspensor, and tapetum, and during the hypersensitive response. There are several convincing cases where these Cys proteases are required for PCD, but this requirement is often not conserved across different plant species. There are also cases where Cys proteases contribute to the speed, but not the timing of PCD, while other Cys proteases are nonessential for PCD, but have other roles, e.g., in the clearance of cell remains after PCD. These data illustrate the need for caution when generalizing the role of Cys proteases in regulating PCD in plants, and call for studies that further investigate plant Cys proteases and other PCD regulators.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimals 3aapoptosis 3acaspases 3acysteine 3ahypersensitive response 3aresearchers 3aseed coat 3atracheary elements 3avacuoles1 avan der Hoorn, Renier A.

Glucose-rich honey crystallizes more rapidly than honey with a high fructose content. However, the size of the sugar crystals is crucial for the mouth feel of crystallised honey. Honeys containing small crystals have a creamy consistency, which is preferred by most consumers. In contrast, large crystals cause a coarse mouth feel. Factors affecting crystal size are of vital interest for the production of high-quality honey and thus analysis of sugar crystal size in honey is crucial. Here we present a simple and efficient method for measuring the size of sugar crystals in honey. A honey drop is placed on a coverslip, which is centrifuged using a converted smoothie maker. This spreads the drop over the coverslip and separates the sugar crystals from each other. Subsequently, the size of the crystals can be conveniently measured by microscopy. Compared to squeezing the honey drop between slide and coverslip, this approach avoids the risk of breaking the crystals. Moreover, the method is highly reproducible as indicated by intra-day and inter-day standard deviations of 7 to 14% for crystal sizes. Simple method for preparation of honey for crystal size analysis by microscopy. Use of cheap, easily accessible equipment. High intra and inter-day reproducibility.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acrystallization 3aequipment 3afructose 3aglucose 3ahoney 3amicroscopy 3amouthfeel 3arisk 0aHoney 0aGlucose 0aMicroscopy 0aCrystallisation 0aMouth feel 0aSugar crystal size 0aAnalysis of sugar crystal size in honey1 aMeixner, Mario1 aDasbach, Reinhard1 aRozhon, Wilfried1 aDasbach, Margot0 tMethodsX.g2022, v. 9 p.101823-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23402x2215-01617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mex.2022.1018233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02638naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001600149245014000165300001600305520129900321592002801620650001101648650001701659650001401676650001901690650002101709650001001730650001501740650000901755650001901764650001401783650001201797650001101809650001701820650001801837650001701855651001001872653002401882653003001906653003001936700001701966700001501983773007801998856008302076852000902159655001202168IND60546200320221122061418.0160903e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054620032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2014.09.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChinese, D.10aEffects of changes in Italian bioenergy promotion schemes for agricultural biogas projects: Insights from a regional optimization model  ap. 189-205.  aItaly has witnessed an extraordinary growth in biogas generation from livestock effluents and agricultural activities in the last few years as well as a severe isomorphic process, leading to a market dominance of 999kW power plants owned by “entrepreneurial farms”. Under the pressure of the economic crisis in the country, the Italian government has restructured renewable energy support schemes, introducing a new program in 2013. In this paper, the effects of the previous and current support schemes on the optimal plant size, feedstock mix and profitability were investigated by introducing a spatially explicit biogas supply chain optimization model, which accounts for different incentive structures. By applying the model to a regional case study, homogenization observed to date is recognized as a result of former incentive structures. Considerable reductions in local economic potentials for agricultural biogas power plants without external heat use, are estimated. New plants are likely to be manure-based and due to the lower energy density of such feedstock, wider supply chains are expected although optimal plant size will be smaller. The new support scheme will therefore most likely eliminate past distortions but also slow down investments in agricultural biogas plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiogas 3acase studies 3aeffluents 3aenergy density 3aentrepreneurship 3afarms 3afeedstocks 3aheat 3ahomogenization 3alivestock 3amarkets 3amodels 3apower plants 3aprofitability 3asupply chain 3aItaly 0aAgricultural biogas 0aSupply chain optimization 0aBioenergy support schemes1 aPatrizio, P.1 aNardin, G.0 tEnergy Policy.g2014 Dec., v. 75 p.189-205dElsevier Ltdx0301-42157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2014.09.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02720naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100007000148245011500218506011700333506007600450520099200526592002801518506003701546650002701583650001801610650002001628650001001648650001001658650003301668650003001701650001401731650003001745650001801775653002701793653002001820653003001840653001801870653001601888653001601904700002101920700001701941700001701958700006801975773010302043856008302146852000902229655001202238IND60788942220221207063521.0220830e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078894222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.btre.2022.e007582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChanu, Khangembam Victoria1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1153-418210aDevelopment of multiplex PCR assay for species-specific detection and identification of Saprolegnia parasitica  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSaprolegnia parasitica is the most important pathogen under the genus, Saprolegnia which causes devastating oomycete diseases in freshwater fish. At present, the most common molecular method for identification of Saprolegnia species is sequencing of ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer (rDNA-ITS) region. In this study, a highly sensitive multiplex PCR targeting rDNA-ITS region and a hypothetical protein gene was developed using two sets of primer pair. In this PCR, two amplicons of different size of 750 bp and 365 bp are produced only in case of S. parasitica while other Saprolegnia species had single amplicon. This protocol could also differentiate Saprolegnia species from other fungus based on the size of rDNA-ITS region. The protocol does not require sequencing and can identify S. parasitica in a single reaction. Therefore, the multiplex PCR developed in this study may prove to be an easier, faster and cheaper molecular method for identification of S. parasitica.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSaprolegnia parasitica 3abiotechnology 3afreshwater fish 3afungi 3agenes 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3aoligodeoxyribonucleotides 3apathogens 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aribosomal DNA 0aSaprolegnia parasitica 0arDNA-ITS region 0aHypothetical protein gene 0aMultiplex PCR 0aSensitivity 0aSpecificity1 aThakuria, Dimpal1 aPant, Vinita1 aBisht, Sweta1 aTandel, Ritesh Shantilal1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0374-35770 tBiotechnology reports.g2022 Sept., v. 35 p.e00758-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23403x2215-017X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.btre.2022.e007583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03738naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004700113040001800160100001400178245009600192300001400288520195000302592002802252650002002280650001802300650001602318650001602334650001402350650001202364650001902376650001702395650001902412650002802431650001802459650002602477650001302503650002402516650002802540650001602568650002102584650001902605650003502624650002302659650002802682650001102710650004302721650003202764650003002796650002302826700001502849700001902864700001502883700001902898773009402917856009303011990002303104852000903127655001203136IND60088955020221116205930.0141102e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008895502DNAL7 a231591012pmid7 a10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2012.10.0702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Ning10aCarotid intima-media thickness in patients with subclinical hypothyroidism: A meta-analysis  ap. 18-25.  aOBJECTIVE: Subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) has been associated with increased carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) in recent studies, but this relationship is controversial. The aim of this study was to assess whether carotid IMT in patients with SCH differs from that in euthyroid subjects. METHODS: Prior to November 2011, we searched PUBMED, EMBASE, COCHRANE LIBRARY databases and the bibliographies of key articles to identify studies that reported carotid IMT in patients with SCH compared with euthyroid subjects. Two reviewers independently evaluated each potential study for eligibility, assessed the methodological quality, and extracted the data. RESULTS: We identified 8 observational studies with 3602 patients that met the eligibility criteria. In patients with SCH, the pooled estimate of the weighted mean difference (WMD) of increased carotid IMT was 0.056 mm (95% CI 0.020, 0.092; P = 0.002). Sensitivity analysis using a pooled sample of the 7 higher-quality studies demonstrated higher carotid IMT level in patients with SCH compared with those with euthyroidism (WMD, 0.064 mm, 95% CI 0.024, 0.105; P = 0.002). In a subgroup analysis, SCH was also associated with a significant increase in carotid IMT among patients with a mean TSH > 10.0 mIU/l (WMD, 0.082 mm, 95% CI 0.049, 0.116; P = 0.00). SCH was associated with a significant increase in systolic blood pressure (SBP), triglyceride (TG) levels, total cholesterol (TC) levels, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels and with a decrease in fasting plasma glucose (FPG). CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis indicates that SCH is associated with an increased carotid IMT, which may due to elevated thyrotropin (TSH), dyslipidemia and hypertension. Increased IMT can also be present in patients with serum TSH values less than 10 mIU/l, although there is significant heterogeneity. Prospective studies with larger samples are necessary to evaluate these observations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatherosclerosis 3ablood glucose 3ablood serum 3acholesterol 3adatabases 3afasting 3ahyperlipidemia 3ahypertension 3ahypothyroidism 3alow density lipoprotein 3ameta-analysis 3aobservational studies 3apatients 3aprospective studies 3asystolic blood pressure 3athyrotropin 3atriacylglycerols 2aBlood Pressure 2aCarotid Intima-Media Thickness 2aCholesterolxblood 2aCholesterol, LDLxblood 2aHumans 2aHyperlipidemiasxbloodxcomplications. 2aHypertensionxcomplications 2aHypothyroidismxpathology 2aThyrotropinxblood1 aZhang, Wei1 aZhang, Yu-zhen1 aYang, Qing1 aChen, Shao-hua0 tAtherosclerosis.g2013 Mar., v. 227, no. 1 p.18-25dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0021-91507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2012.10.0703Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01763naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001600112245007500128300001600203520073700219592002800956650002000984650002001004650001701024650001401041650001301055650001301068650001001081650001001091650001701101650002201118650001201140650001801152653002101170653001901191700002001210773015001230852000901380655001201389IND60706519120221119033521.0210117e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070651912DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGanesan, S.10aInfluence of Moisture Content on Physical Properties of Foxtail Millet  ap. 390-395.  aThe physical properties of the foxtail millet grain were found out using various methods.

The BNPs were found to be efficient in the reduction of methylene blue dye as well as the scavenging of DPPH free radicals such that the MB dye was completely degraded in just 17 min at the maximum absorption of 660 nm. Therefore, it is concluded that Cu-Ni BNPs can be successfully synthesized using Gazania rigens extract with suitable size and potent catalytic and radical scavenging activities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGazania rigens 3aabsorption 3aantioxidants 3acrystal structure 3amethanol 3amethylene blue 3aparticle size 3aphotoreduction 3aspectrophotometers 3awater1 aGulzar, Afzaal 1 aFaisal, Ali,1 aPervaiz, Muhammad 1 aAli, Zahid 1 aKhan, Safia 1 aSaeed, Zohaib 1 aAhmed, Mukhtiar 1 aAlothman, Asma A.0 tWater.g2021 Sept. 26, v. 13, no. 19dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w131926533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02661naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002900148245015600177300001600333520112700349592002801476650002801504650002701532650001701559650001501576650001901591650003101610650001701641650001401658650001001672653000801682653001201690653001301702653001101715653000801726653000801734653000801742653000801750653003001758653003001788653001901818653002401837653001001861700002401871700002001895700002601915773011101941856008202052852000902134655001202143IND60606673820221117235502.0180727e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060667382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.trac.2015.10.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLattanzio, Veronica M.T.10aValidation of screening methods according to Regulation 519/2014/EU.

Emphasis is given to guidelines set in the Regulation 519/2014/EU that specifies validation criteria for mycotoxin screening methods to be used for official control purposes. The application of this validation scheme is demonstrated through a case study. A commercial lateral flow immunoassay for deoxynivalenol has been and evaluated for its applicability to verify wheat compliance with EC maximum permitted level. The validation design provided information on the precision profile of the method, cut-off, false suspect and false negative rates of samples containing deoxynivalenol above the legal limit.The influence of the co-occurrence of major deoxynivalenol modified forms, i.e. 3-acetyldeoxynivalenol, 15-acetyldeoxynivalenol, and deoxynivalenol-3-glucoside on test results, was evaluated by a factorial design. Finally, the applicability of the validated immunoassay was demonstrated by analysis of naturally contaminated wheat samples, and comparison with results obtained by a LC-MS/MS confirmatory method.  aPublisher supplied data 3a15-acetyldeoxynivalenol 3a3-acetyldeoxynivalenol 3acase studies 3acompliance 3adeoxynivalenol 3adeoxynivalenol-3-glucoside 3aimmunoassays 3ascreening 3awheat 0aDON 0a3-AcDON 0a15-AcDON 0aDON-3G 0aMRM 0aRSD 0aSCR 0aSTC 0aScreening test validation 0aLateral flow immunoassays 0aDeoxynivalenol 0aModified mycotoxins 0aWheat1 aCiasca, Biancamaria1 aPowers, Stephen1 aHolst, Christoph von,0 tTrends in analytical chemistry.g2016 Feb., v. 76 p.137-144dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11800x0165-99367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.trac.2015.10.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02748naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005700148245015600205300001800361520144400379592002801823596010301851650001801954650002301972650001101995650000902006650001702015650002302032650001102055650001602066700002902082700006202111773013302173856008302306852000902389655001202398IND60754014820221122003014.0220311e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075401482DNAL7 a10.1007/s10641-021-01155-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZuev, Ivan V.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0695-893610aSeasonal formation of annual rings on the scales of Baikal grayling inhabiting the middle reaches of the Yenisei River under altered temperature regime  ap. 1293-1302.  aThe seasonal formation of annual rings on the scales of Baikal grayling from the middle reaches of the Yenisei River has been studied to find out the reasons for the high growth rate of the grayling under altered temperature regime downstream of the dam of the Krasnoyarsk Hydroelectric Plant. The number of circuli outside the last identified annuli and in the second, third, and fourth completed annuli was estimated on 569 fish caught during the annual cycle. The von Bertalanffy growth function was used to describe the increment in the number of circuli over a year. The calculation showed that a new annual ring was produced in July. In November, there was no statistically significant difference between the circulus number in scale increment and the circulus number in the corresponding completed annuli of older fish. Thus, despite the increased duration of the period with optimal water temperatures downstream of the dam of the Krasnoyarsk Hydroelectric Plant, fish growth was observed in a limited period of the year, from July to November. The probable reason for the high growth rate of grayling in the study area is that the fish do not have to waste energy on seasonal migration to the tributaries. Taking into account that grayling biomass production in the middle Yenisei occurs from July to November, we can recommend shifting the dates of commercial fishing for grayling to the end of this period—November–December.  aPublisher supplied data  a20-44-240009cRussian Foundation for Basic Research and Krasnoyarsk Regional Scientific Foundation 3aanimal growth 3abiomass production 3aenergy 3afish 3agrowth rings 3amigratory behavior 3arivers 3atemperature1 aAndrushchenko, Pavel Yu.1 aZotina, Tatiana A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4792-15820 tEnvironmental biology of fishes.g2021 Oct., v. 104, no. 10 p.1293-1302dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl43475x0378-19097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10641-021-01155-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03849naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002500138245011800163300001600281500002000297520240900317592002802726596005502754596005502809596006102864596003802925650001302963650001902976650001302995650001503008650001203023650001303035650001103048650001203059650001403071651002103085700006103106700005603167773012303223856007203346852000903418655001203427IND60663194320221119220652.0190909e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066319432DNAL7 a10.1002/aqc.31832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGordine, Samantha A.14aThe importance of Southern Ocean frontal systems for the improvement of body condition in southern elephant seals  ap. 283-304.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAs top predators, it has been suggested that southern elephant seals serve as sentinels of ecosystem status to inform management and conservation. This is because southern elephant seals annually undertake two large‐scale foraging migrations for 2–3 and 7–8 months to replenish resources after fasting during breeding and moulting and often rely on dynamic macroscale latitudinal fronts to provide favourable foraging through aggregating prey. Yet it is largely unknown whether southern elephant seals respond to changes in frontal systems over the years, whether their foraging success is associated with specific frontal systems shifts, and how flexible southern elephant seals populations are in behaviourally adapting to changes in frontal systems. This study examines the relationship between frontal systems and the resource acquisition of 64 southern elephant seals during four post‐moult and three post‐breeding migrations between 2005 and 2010. Satellite‐relay‐data‐loggers provided in situ measurements concurrent with >27,500 dive profiles to define fronts and interfrontal zones between the Subtropical Frontal Zone and the Southern Boundary of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. For >430,000 in situ measurements water mass properties could be identified. Generally, southern elephant seals associate more frequently with more southerly, higher‐latitude fronts/zones. Body condition improvements related to a given frontal system or water mass vary strongly according to year, season, month and sex. The variability in body condition improvements is higher in some frontal systems than in others, probably owing to shifts in the Subantarctic and Polar Front. During a migration, some individuals stay within ≤3 frontal systems, whilst others change between several frontal systems and primarily improve their body condition in upper ocean waters. Southern elephant seals do not trace particular water masses across frontal systems, and both surface and deep foraging strategies are used. This suggests that southern elephant seals do not target particular water masses but adjust foraging and movement strategies to exploit boundary areas at which mixing and prey aggregation is high. The large behavioural plasticity towards the spatio‐temporal variability in the different oceanographic regions they encounter could indicate resilience against environmental changes.  aPublisher supplied data  aNE/E018289/1cNatural Environment Research Council  aNE/L501852/1cNatural Environment Research Council  aNER/D/S/2002/00426cNatural Environment Research Council  aHR09011cScottish Funding Council 3aMirounga 3abody condition 3abreeding 3aecosystems 3afasting 3aforaging 3amixing 3amolting 3apredators 3aAntarctic region1 aFedak, Michael A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9569-11281 aBoehme, Lars1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3513-68160 tAquatic conservation.g2019 Sept., v. 29 Suppl S1 p.283-304dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl51367x1052-76137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/aqc.31833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01575naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002300146245017300169300001400342520025600356592002800612650001700640650002600657650001400683650001800697650001800715651001900733653002500752653002300777653002000800653002600820653001700846653001200863653001500875653001200890653001200902653002500914653002200939773010300961856008001064852000901144655001201153IND60481784220221121023343.0160210e20160126xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048178422DNAL7 a10.1515/jlecol-2015-00162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aŠtefánek, Michal10aRole of Plant Dominants on Abandoned Tailings Containment from Manganese-Ore Maining in Chvaletice, Eastern Bohemia, Czech Republic (Overview of Long-Term Case Studies)  ap. 91-96.  aDuring long-term research (almost forty years) of tailings containment in Chvaletice (Eastern Bohemia) were also carried out studies on the role of each plant dominants in succession.

However, due to the special aquifer structure in the karst areas of southern China, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) can easily enter the water environment of underground rivers and cause serious pollution, which will affect the water quality safety. In this study, Qing-shui Spring underground river in Nanning city was selected as a representative of the typical underground river in southern China, and the pollution characteristics, source analysis, ecological risk assessment and diffusion law of PAHs were studied. The results showed that the total concentration of PAHs in groundwater and surface sediments was in the range of 282.42–464.88 ng/L and 400.14–1194.69 ng/g, respectively, and the overall concentrations of PAHs were below the moderate pollution level. Pollutant discharge and physical and chemical properties of PAHs caused the concentrations of PAHs to decrease gradually from upstream to downstream, but the proportion of high-cyclic PAHs increased gradually. According to the source analysis results of the ratio method, PAHs sources in groundwater were mainly biomass combustion sources in the upstream, oil sources in the middle and mixed sources in the downstream. Sediment and groundwater had some differences. The middle and upper reaches were the source of biomass combustion, while the middle and lower reaches were the mixed source. The ecological risk assessment results showed that the ecological risk of groundwater was at a moderate level, while the ecological risk of sediment was at a low level. Benzo[a]anthracene (BaA) and benzo[b]fluoranthene (BbF) in groundwater and acenaphthylene (Acy) and fluoranthene (Flu) in sediment should be monitored intensively. Appropriate control measures should be put in place to prevent further pollution. Partition coefficients varied from 0.73 to 3.85 L/g in the sediment–water interface, increasing with the rise of PAH compounds. All of the organic carbon partition coefficients (Kₒc) in the sediment–water interface were higher than predicate values based on the typical model of equilibrium distribution; this indicated that PAHs were strongly adsorbed in the sediment. The linear free energy relationship coefficient between the Kₒc value and the n-octanol-water partition coefficient (Kₒw) was 0.85 but the slope was lower than 1, indicating that sediment in the Qing-shui Spring underground river had weak lipophilic characteristics and adsorption ability for PAHs. The results can provide a reference for the risk assessment and pollution control of PAHs in the karst underground rivers in South China.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGibbs free energy 3aadsorption 3aanthracenes 3aaquifers 3abiomass 3acombustion 3aenvironmental assessment 3agroundwater 3akarsts 3alipophilicity 3amodels 3aoils 3aorganic carbon 3apollutants 3apollution 3apollution control 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3arivers 3asediment-water interface 3asediments 3awater quality 3aChina1 aLi, Jiang 1 aLu, Li 1 aCao, Jianwen 1 aZhao, Liangjie 1 aLuan, Song 0 tWater.g2021 Sept. 26, v. 13, no. 19dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w131926553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01497naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245009600156300002000252520045300272592002800725650001400753650001300767650001300780650001400793700001800807700001700825700002200842700002000864700001800884700002000902700001800922773012400940856007401064852000901138655001201147IND60642096820221119042244.0190506e20170807xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064209682DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ra07445j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShu, Keitou10aSynthesis of the Src SH2 domain and its application in bioassays for mirror-image screening  ap. 38725-38732.  aThe Src SH2 domain was synthesized via native chemical ligation of two fragment peptides.

Comparison between different proteins  ap. 30-36.  aPreviously, we studied bovine serum albumin (BSA) uptake to poly(ethylenimine) (PEI)-grafted Sepharose resins, and an ionic capacity (IC) range (600–740mmol/L) for steep increases of both protein capacity (qm) and effective pore diffusion coefficient (De) was found. In this work, seven PEI-grafted Sepharose FF resins at IC range of 270–1030mmol/L were synthesized to investigate the effect of protein properties on the adsorption and uptake kinetics using BSA and γ-globulin as two model proteins. For BSA, the change trends of qm and De values with IC were well consistent with the previous results. For γ-globulin, the qm values increased slowly till reaching a maximum value at IC=560mmol/L and then decreased rapidly at IC>560mol/L. The De values nearly kept unchanged at low ICs (IC<460mmol/L), and increased steeply at IC>460mmol/L till reaching a maximum at 680mmol/L (De/D0=0.48±0.01). After that increase, the De values for γ-globulin dropped quickly at IC>680mol/L, which was not observed for BSA. It is interesting to note that in the narrow IC range of 460–680mmol/L, the De values of γ-globulin increased dramatically for more than four folds. Moreover, it is notable that the IC range where the hopping of De values occurred for γ-globulin was earlier than that for BSA (460 vs. 560mmol/L). The earlier hopping of γ-globulin uptake rate was attributed to its larger size and less net charge, which facilitated the happenings of the “chain delivery” effect. The quick drops of both qm and De values for γ-globulin at IC>680mmol/L were considered due to its large size, which led to the significant decrease of its effective pore volume. The results indicate that both PEI layer and protein size played important roles in protein adsorption to PEI-grafted resins, and further prove the “chain delivery” effect did contributed significantly to the uptake rate hopping in the PEI-grafted resins. This work could also help the design and selection of resins based on protein characteristics and benefit optimization of practical chromatographic processes for therapeutic proteins with PEI-grafted anion exchangers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aagarose 3abiopharmaceuticals 3abovine serum albumin 3achromatography 3adiffusivity 3agamma-globulins 3amodels 3aresins 0aIon exchange chromatography 0aProtein adsorption 0aKinetics 0aPoly(ethylenimine) 0aAlbumin 0aγ-Globulin1 aLiu, Na1 aWei, Wei1 aYu, Lin-Ling1 aMa, Guanghui1 aSun, Yan0 tJournal of chromatography.g2014 May 16, v. 1342 p.30-36dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl50504x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2014.03.0363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03555naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100006300138245014600201300001600347500002000363520202700383592002802410596002402438596002302462596002202485650001702507650001402524650001702538650002002555650002402575650003002599650001202629650001502641650001402656650001302670650002002683650001202703650001102715651001902726700002602745700002602771700001802797700002302815700001902838773012302857856007202980852000903052655001203061IND60663194520221119222038.0190909e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066319452DNAL7 a10.1002/aqc.31352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aServidio, Antonella1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0328-106910aSite fidelity and movement patterns of short‐finned pilot whales within the Canary Islands: Evidence for resident and transient populations  ap. 227-241.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe geographic location and oceanographic, physical, and chemical water properties make the Canary Islands one of the planet's biodiversity hotspots. The short‐finned pilot whale (Globicephala macrorhynchus) is one of the archipelago's most commonly encountered species and is potentially vulnerable to a range of anthropogenic pressures, including habitat degradation, acoustic pollution, fishing, whale‐watching operations, and shipping. Assessment of impact has not been possible because of a lack of even basic information about occurrence and distribution. Spatial and temporal distributions, ranging behaviour, and residence patterns of short‐finned pilot whales were explored for the first time using survey and photo‐identification data collected in the Canary Islands between 1999 and 2012. In total, 1,081 pilot whale sightings were recorded during 70,620 km of search effort over 1,782 survey days. Pilot whales were detected year round and distributed non‐uniformly within the archipelago, with greater densities concentrated in patchy areas mainly on the leeward side of the main islands. In total, 1,320 well‐marked individuals were identified, which exhibited a large degree of variability in site fidelity. Different but not isolated subpopulations of pilot whales that share ranges and maintain social interactions were apparently present in the Canary Islands. Strong evidence of an island‐associated subpopulation was found, with a group of 50 ‘core resident’ individuals associated particularly with Tenerife. There were also ‘transient’ individuals or temporary migrants, which, probably driven by inter‐ and intra‐specific competition, may travel long distances whilst using the archipelago as part of a larger range. These findings fill a major gap in the knowledge of this species’ occurrence, distribution, movements, and site fidelity in the archipelago and provide much needed data to allow the initiation of informed conservation assessments and management actions.  aPublisher supplied data  cFundación La Caixa  cSpanish Government  cCanary Government 3aGlobicephala 3aacoustics 3abiodiversity 3adata collection 3ahabitat destruction 3aintraspecific competition 3aislands 3aphilopatry 3apollution 3ashipping 3asocial behavior 3asurveys 3awhales 3aCanary Islands1 aPérez‐Gil, Enrique1 aPérez‐Gil, Mónica1 aCañadas, Ana1 aHammond, Philip S.1 aMartín, Vidal0 tAquatic conservation.g2019 Sept., v. 29 Suppl S1 p.227-241dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl51367x1052-76137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/aqc.31353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02486naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002500149245010500174300001600279520127400295592002801569650002701597650001101624650001401635650002201649650001501671650001501686650002201701650001201723650001501735650001901750651001901769653002201788653001801810653001501828653001201843653001801855700002101873773007801894856008301972852000902055655001202064IND60546200720221123032641.0160903e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054620072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2014.09.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHope, Alexander John10aAttitudes and behaviours of private sector landlords towards the energy efficiency of tenanted homes  ap. 369-378.  aThe UK׳s housing stock generates approximately 27% of the country׳s total annual carbon emissions. In light of the legally binding targets to reduce carbon emissions, new housing is subject to a tightening of regulations governing energy demand and efficiency resulting in a gradual improvement in carbon emissions. The question is how to achieve the deep carbon emission reductions from existing domestic properties, of which 75% will still be in use in 2050. Government has sought to provide incentives to homeowners to improve the energy efficiency of their households, and mandate improvements in socially rented housing using a range of fiscal measures, most recently the ‘Green Deal’. There has however been little consideration of the 18% of UK households who privately rent their home, a tenure that is growing fast. The aim of this research is to investigate the factors that influence private sector landlords when considering energy efficiency improvements to their tenanted homes. The results indicate that government policy has consistently failed to engage private sector landlords in the issue of energy efficiency and thus measures must be taken to understand the motivations of landlords in order to design effective incentives and interventions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aattitudes and opinions 3acarbon 3aemissions 3aenergy efficiency 3ahomeowners 3ahouseholds 3aissues and policy 3aleasing 3amotivation 3aprivate sector 3aUnited Kingdom 0aEnergy efficiency 0aEnergy policy 0aGreen Deal 0aHousing 0aRented sector1 aBooth, Alexander0 tEnergy Policy.g2014 Dec., v. 75 p.369-378dElsevier Ltdx0301-42157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2014.09.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02291naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002200112245011000134300001600244520100000260592002801260650001801288650002801306650002701334650002601361650001601387650001101403650001501414650002401429650001501453650001701468650000901485650002101494650001001515650000901525650001801534653001301552653001701565653000801582653003301590700001601623700001701639700001801656773015001674852000901824655001201833IND60706519520221119033502.0210117e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070651952DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYadav, Shashidhar10aEffect of Nutrient Management on Yield and Nutrient Status on Soil in Mungbean (Vigna radiata L.

The availability of water is essential for aquaculture development, but there is no knowledge about the potential inland water resources of the Rwenzori region of Uganda. Though remote sensing is popularly utilized during studies involving various aspects of surface water, it has never been employed in mapping inland water bodies of Uganda. In this study, we assessed the efficiency of seven remote-sensing derived water index methods to map the available surface water resources in the Rwenzori region using moderate resolution Sentinel 2A/B imagery. From the four targeted sites, the Automated Water Extraction Index for urban areas (AWEInsh) and shadow removal (AWEIsh) were the best at identifying inland water bodies in the region. Both AWEIsh and AWEInsh consistently had the highest overall accuracy (OA) and kappa (OA > 90%, kappa > 0.8 in sites 1 and 2; OA > 84.9%, kappa > 0.61 in sites 3 and 4), as well as the lowest omission errors in all sites. AWEI was able to suppress classification noise from shadows and other non-water dark surfaces. However, none of the seven water indices used during this study was able to efficiently extract narrow water bodies such as streams. This was due to a combination of factors like the presence of terrain shadows, a dense vegetation cover, and the image resolution. Nonetheless, AWEI can efficiently identify other surface water resources such as crater lakes and rivers/streams that are potentially suitable for aquaculture from moderate resolution Sentinel 2A/B imagery.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal proteins 3aaquaculture 3aautomation 3alandscapes 3aremote sensing 3asurface water 3avegetation cover 3aUganda1 aNevejan, Nancy 1 aVan der Zande, Dimitry 1 aBrown, Molly E.1 aVan Stappen, Gilbert 0 tWater.g2021 Sept. 26, v. 13, no. 19dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w131926573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03346naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004700113040001800160100002000178245011000198300001400308520149200322592002801814650001001842650002001852650003201872650001801904650001201922650001301934650001701947650000901964650001601973650001801989650001202007650003402019650003402053650003102087650002002118650004102138650003602179650004302215650000902258650002302267650003902290650004402329700001802373700001902391700001902410700001902429700001802448700002202466700001602488700002102504773009402525856009302619990002302712852000902735655001202744IND60088955420221116205650.0141102e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008895542DNAL7 a233125042pmid7 a10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2012.12.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSasaki, Takeshi10aMatrix metalloproteinase-2 deficiency impairs aortic atherosclerotic calcification in ApoE-deficient mice  ap. 43-50.  aOBJECTIVE: Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) have been implicated in the process of vascular calcification. However, the exact roles of individual MMPs in vascular calcification are poorly understood. To study the putative role of MMP-2 in atherogenic calcification in vivo and in vitro, we investigate whether or not MMP-2 deficiency affects aortic atherosclerotic calcification in apolipoprotein E-deficient (Apoe⁻/⁻) mice and cultured smooth muscle cell (SMC) calcification. METHODS AND RESULTS: The area of calcified lesions in aortic intima was significantly larger in MMP-2⁺/⁺ Apoe⁻/⁻ mice at 45 and 60 weeks of age than in MMP-2⁻/⁻ Apoe⁻/⁻ mice. In these aortic calcified atherosclerotic lesions, the expression of type II collagen, osteoprotegerin, bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-2 and osteocalcin which are chondrocyte maker and bone-related proteins, was observed. MMP-2 deficiency reduced BMP-2 and osteocalcin expression in aortae in Apoe⁻/⁻ mice at 30 weeks and 45–60-weeks-old, respectively. The expressions of MMP-2 and that of α-SMC actin were observed in chondrocyte-like cells of calcified lesions. Beta-glycerophosphate administration induced calcium deposition in MMP-2⁺/⁺ aorta-derived cultured SMCs, and this calcium deposition was significantly suppressed in MMP-2⁻/⁻ aorta-derived cultured SMCs. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that MMP-2 may contribute to the mechanisms of calcification associated with atherosclerosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactin 3aatherosclerosis 3abone morphogenetic proteins 3acalcification 3acalcium 3acollagen 3agelatinase A 3amice 3aosteocalcin 3asmooth muscle 2aAnimals 2aAortaxmetabolismxpathology. 2aApolipoproteins Exdeficiency 2aAtherosclerosisxpathology 2aCells, Cultured 2aChondrocytesxmetabolismxpathology. 2aGlycerophosphatesxpharmacology 2aMatrix Metalloproteinase 2xdeficiency 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred C57BL 2aMyocytes, Smooth Musclexpathology 2aVascular Calcificationxphysiopathology1 aNakamura, Kae1 aSasada, Kumiko1 aOkada, Satoshi1 aCheng, Xian Wu1 aSuzuki, Tohru1 aMurohara, Toyoaki1 aSato, Kohji1 aKuzuya, Masafumi0 tAtherosclerosis.g2013 Mar., v. 227, no. 1 p.43-50dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0021-91507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2012.12.0083Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03335naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245019000165300001600355520138300371592002801754650002301782650001601805650002601821650002801847650001601875650001801891650001201909650001701921650001301938650002201951650002101973650001701994650001702011650003202028650002402060650001502084650001102099650001302110650002702123650002502150650000902175650001002184650001502194650002802209650002002237653001702257653002502274653001002299653003402309653003002343653003602373700002302409700002202432700002102454700001902475773011202494856008202606852000902688655001202697IND60544127920221120144354.0190415e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054412792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jff.2015.01.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOnuh, John O.10aKinetics of in vitro renin and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition by chicken skin protein hydrolysates and their blood pressure lowering effects in spontaneously hypertensive rats  ap. 133-143.  aChicken skin protein hydrolysates (CSPHs) and their membrane ultrafiltration fractions were investigated for their blood pressure lowering effects. Chicken skins from thigh or breast muscles were hydrolyzed with 3% Alcalase or 1% pepsin/pancreatin, respectively; hydrolysates were then fractionated into <1, 1–3, 3–5, and 5–10 kDa peptide sizes. Chicken breast skin hydrolysate (CBSH) and peptide fractions inhibited angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) with IC50 values of 0.36–0.64 mg/mL, which were significantly (p < 0.05) higher than the 0.42–0.75 mg/mL values obtained for chicken thigh skin hydrolysate (CTSH) and peptide fractions. Results suggest that a high content of branched-chain amino acids contributed to the significantly (p < 0.05) higher ACE-inhibition by <1 kDa peptide fraction. All the samples with exception of the CBSH 3 kDa fraction had similar renin inhibitory values. Kinetics studies revealed that enzyme inhibition pattern was mostly of the mixed-type for ACE and renin. Oral administration of 100 mg peptides/kg body weight to spontaneously hypertensive rats led to maximum systolic blood pressure reduction of −32.67 and −31.33 mmHg after 6 h for CTSH and CBSH, respectively. We conclude that the CSPHs have potential use as active ingredients to formulate antihypertensive functional foods and nutraceuticals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive ingredients 3aamino acids 3aanimal disease models 3aantihypertensive effect 3abody weight 3abreast muscle 3abreasts 3achicken skin 3achickens 3aenzyme inhibition 3afunctional foods 3ahydrolysates 3ahypertension 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3aoral administration 3apancreatin 3apepsin 3apeptides 3apeptidyl-dipeptidase A 3aprotein hydrolysates 3arats 3arenin 3asubtilisin 3asystolic blood pressure 3aultrafiltration 0aChicken skin 0aProtein hydrolysates 0aRenin 0aAngiotensin converting enzyme 0aAntihypertensive peptides 0aSpontaneously hypertensive rats1 aGirgih, Abraham T.1 aMalomo, Sunday A.1 aAluko, Rotimi E.1 aAliani, Michel0 tJournal of functional foods.g2015 Apr., v. 14 p.133-143dElsevier LtdwJournal:J000000142x1756-46467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jff.2015.01.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02403naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245013700164300001400301520112200315592002801437650001501465650001601480650002101496650002501517650001701542650001401559650002501573653001701598653001701615653002501632653001501657653002601672653002201698700001701720700001301737700001401750700001701764773010901781856008201890852000901972655001201981IND60606674020221117235610.0180727e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060667402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.trac.2015.11.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Xijun10aDiscovery and development of innovative drug from traditional medicine by integrated chinmedomics strategies in the post-genomic era  ap. 86-94.  aTraditional medicine which consisted of multiple herbal drugs and its complexity greatly limited the new drug discovery from traditional medicine in the post-genomic era. Natural products discovery approach affords no information about compound structure or pharmacological activities until late in the discovery process and leads to low probabilities of finding compounds with unique biological properties. Therefore, by integrating serum pharmacochemistry-based screening with high-resolution metabolomics analysis, we have developed a new platform, termed chinmedomics which is capable of directly discover the bioactive constituents. By analyzing the correlation between the endogenous biomarker of diseases or TCM syndrome and exogenous constituents to find the highly associated constituents with efficacy of formulae as the effective substances, and further clarifying the activities of effective substances, and may discover lead compounds and make the innovative drug discovery based on clinical experiences. It will significantly advance the drug discovery from traditional medicine in the post-genomic era.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomarkers 3ablood serum 3aherbal medicines 3amedicinal properties 3ametabolomics 3ascreening 3atraditional medicine 0aChinmedomics 0aMetabolomics 0aTraditional medicine 0aBiomarkers 0aLiquid chromatography 0aMass spectrometry1 aZhang, Aihua1 aSun, Hui1 aHan, Ying1 aYan, Guangli0 tTrends in analytical chemistry.g2016 Feb., v. 76 p.86-94dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11800x0165-99367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.trac.2015.11.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02598naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002300137245013000160300001800290520126400308592002801572650001201600650001101612650001301623650002101636650001501657650001501672650001401687650001101701651002201712653002601734653001501760653001401775653001701789653002301806653001701829653001301846700002201859700002501881700002501906700002701931700002101958773010201979856003802081852000902119655001202128IND50062289220221121080254.0130322s2012    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006228922DNAL7 a10.1071/MF120262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFraser, Matthew W.10aNutrient status of seagrasses cannot be inferred from system-scale distribution of phosphorus in Shark Bay, Western Australia  ap. 1015-1026.  aDifferences in phosphorus (P) availability can influence the ecology and physiology of seagrass communities; and are usually inferred from changes in the relative P content in seagrass leaves. Shark Bay is a subtropical marine embayment, with decreasing P concentrations in the water column and sediments from north to south across the entire embayment. We examined the P and nitrogen (N) content of seagrass leaves and P content of sediments across the Faure Sill and Wooramel delta region of Shark Bay, to determine whether the leaf content of seagrasses in Shark Bay also decreased from north to south over smaller spatial scales. Nutrient content of Amphibolis antarctica and Halodule uninervis were highly variable and were not strongly correlated with sediment P concentrations. Mean N:P ratios of seagrasses (<33.5) were not indicative of P limitation, as has been previously assumed for Shark Bay. We conclude that availability of P for uptake by seagrasses across Shark Bay may be highly localised and cannot be predicted from system-scale gradients (>100km) of sedimentary P distributions. We suggest that P availability to seagrasses is more likely a complex function of differing nutrient inputs, rates of delivery to the plants and cycling rates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aecology 3aleaves 3anitrogen 3anutrient content 3aphosphorus 3aphysiology 3asediments 3asharks 3aWestern Australia 0aAmphibolis antarctica 0acalcareous 0acarbonate 0aC:N:P ratios 0aHalodule uninervis 0ariver floods 0asalinity1 aKendrick, Gary A.1 aGrierson, Pauline F.1 aFourqurean, James W.1 aVanderklift, Mathew A.1 aWalker, Diana I.0 tMarine & freshwater research.g2012, v. 63, no. 11 p.1015-1026dCSIRO Publishingx1323-16507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/MF12026  aDNAL 7aarticle03671naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245018400172300001800356520166200374592002802036650003502064650001502099650002802114650001902142650001502161650003102176650001302207650001902220650001902239650001902258650002502277650002202302650002102324650000902345650001102354650002002365650003902385650001702424650002002441653002502461653002402486653003402510653004002544653002402584653002202608700003002630700002202660700001902682700001802701700002502719700002302744700002202767700001902789700002202808773012102830856008502951852000903036655001203045IND60634625120221117233918.0190606e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063462512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbagen.2019.03.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSofińska, Kamila10aInvestigation of quaternary structure of aggregating 3-ketosteroid dehydrogenase from Sterolibacterium denitrificans: In the pursuit of consensus of various biophysical techniques  ap. 1027-1039.  aIn this work we analyzed the quaternary structure of FAD-dependent 3-ketosteroid dehydrogenase (AcmB) from Sterolibacterium denitrificans, the protein that in solution forms massive aggregates (>600 kDa). Using size-excursion chromatography (SEC), dynamic light scattering (DLS), native-PAGE and atomic force microscopy (AFM) we studied the nature of enzyme aggregation. Partial protein de-aggregation was facilitated by the presence of non-ionic detergent such as Tween 20 or by a high degree of protein dilution but not by addition of a reducing agent or an increase of ionic strength. De-aggregating influence of Tween 20 had no impact on either enzyme’s specific activity or FAD reconstitution to recombinant AcmB. The joint experimental (DLS, isoelectric focusing) and theoretical investigations demonstrated gradual shift of enzyme’s isoelectric point upon aggregation from 8.6 for a monomeric form to even 5.0. The AFM imaging on mica or highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) surface enabled observation of individual protein monomers deposited from a highly diluted solution (0.2 μg/ml). Such approach revealed that native AcmB can indeed be monomeric. AFM imaging supported by theoretical random sequential adsorption (RSA) kinetics allowed estimation of distribution enzyme forms in the bulk solution: 5%, monomer, 11.4% dimer and 12% trimer. Finally, based on results of AFM as well as analysis of the surface of AcmB homology models we have observed that aggregation is most probably initiated by hydrophobic forces and then assisted by electrostatic attraction between negatively charged aggregates and positively charged monomers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSterolibacterium denitrificans 3aadsorption 3aatomic force microscopy 3achromatography 3adetergents 3aelectrostatic interactions 3agraphene 3ahydrophobicity 3aimage analysis 3aionic strength 3aisoelectric focusing 3aisoelectric point 3alight scattering 3amica 3amodels 3aoxidoreductases 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3apolysorbates 3areducing agents 0aQuaternary structure 0aProtein aggregation 0aSize excursion chromatography 0aAtomic force microscopy of proteins 0aAdsorption kinetics 0aIsoelectric point1 aWojtkiewicz, Agnieszka M.1 aWójcik, Patrycja1 aZastawny, Olga1 aGuzik, Maciej1 aWiniarska, Agnieszka1 aWaligórski, Piotr1 aCieśla, Michał,1 aBarbasz, Jakub1 aSzaleniec, Maciej0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2019 June, v. 1863, no. 6 p.1027-1039dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11872x0304-41657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbagen.2019.03.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03718naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024004700135040001800182100002400200245015200224300001400376520160600390592002801996650001802024650002102042650002002063650001602083650001602099650002102115650001602136650000902152650001302161650001802174650002802192650001402220650001202234650004502246650004202291650002302333650001102356650001702367650004202384650001102426650003102437650004202468650000902510650003602519650002702555650003502582650002902617700001902646700002102665700003102686700002302717700002202740700002102762700001702783700002502800773009402825856009302919990002303012852000903035655001203044IND60088955620221116205900.0141102e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008895562DNAL7 a231592312pmid7 aPMC35707412pmcid7 a10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2012.10.0642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHandattu, Shaila P.10aTwo apolipoprotein E mimetic peptides with similar cholesterol reducing properties exhibit differential atheroprotective effects in LDL-R null mice  ap. 58-64.  aOBJECTIVE: We investigated two apoE mimetic peptides with similar long-term plasma cholesterol reducing abilities for their effects on atherosclerotic lesions in Western diet-fed female LDL-receptor (LDL-R) null mice. METHODS AND RESULTS: Single doses of peptides Ac-hE18A-NH₂ and mR18L were administered retro-orbitally to LDL-R null mice on Western diet and plasma cholesterol was measured at 10 min, 4 h, and 24 h post administration. Peptide mR18L and not Ac-hE18A-NH₂ reduced plasma cholesterol levels significantly at 4 h post administration. However, multiple administrations (100 μg/mouse twice weekly for 8 weeks) resulted in a similar reduction in plasma cholesterol. Only the plasma from the Ac-hE18A-NH₂ group had significantly reduced reactive oxygen species levels at the end of the treatment protocol. Both mR18L and Ac-hE18A-NH₂ showed reduced atherosclerotic lesion areas. However, peptide Ac-hE18A-NH₂ was significantly more effective in inhibiting atherosclerosis. Both peptides reduced total plaque macrophage load compared to the saline treated animals, with peptide Ac-hE18A-NH₂ having a greater reduction. Incubation of HepG2 cells and THP-1 monocyte-derived macrophages with both peptides in the presence of oxidized phospholipid showed that Ac-hE18A-NH₂ promotes the secretion of apoE from the cells whereas mR18L does not. CONCLUSIONS: Despite similar reductions in plasma cholesterol levels, Ac-hE18A-NH₂ was more effective in inhibiting lesions than mR18L, possibly due to its ability to promote the secretion of apoE from hepatocytes and macrophages.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern diets 3aapolipoprotein E 3aatherosclerosis 3acholesterol 3ahepatocytes 3ahuman cell lines 3amacrophages 3amice 3apeptides 3aphospholipids 3areactive oxygen species 3asecretion 2aAnimals 2aApolipoproteins Exchemistryxsecretion. 2aAtherosclerosisxprevention & control 2aCholesterolxblood 2aFemale 2aHep G2 Cells 2aHepatocytesxdrug effectsxsecretion. 2aHumans 2aLipoproteinsxpharmacology 2aMacrophagesxdrug effectsxsecretion. 2aMice 2aPeptide Fragmentsxpharmacology 2aPeptidesxpharmacology 2aReactive Oxygen Speciesxblood 2aReceptors, LDLxgenetics1 aNayyar, Gaurav1 aGarber, David W.1 aPalgunachari, Mayakonda N.1 aMonroe, Candyce E.1 aKeenum, Tamara D.1 aMishra, Vinod K.1 aDatta, Geeta1 aAnantharamaiah, G.M.0 tAtherosclerosis.g2013 Mar., v. 227, no. 1 p.58-64dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0021-91507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2012.10.0643Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01102naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245007800158300002000236520009900256592002800355650002300383650002300406650001300429650001300442650000900455700001500464700001400479700001500493700001900508700001700527773013700544856007400681852000900755655001200764IND60660701420221122075017.0190827e20140930xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066070142DNAL7 a10.1039/c4cc05826g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Jianwu10aVisualized detection of melamine in milk by supramolecular hydrogelations  ap. 12873-12876.  aWe reported a visualized detection system for melamine based on supramolecular dydrogelations.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical reactions 3afood contamination 3agelation 3amelamine 3amilk1 aOu, Caiwen1 aShi, Yang1 aWang, Ling1 aChen, Minsheng1 aYang, Zhimou0 tChemical communications.g2014 Sept. 30, v. 50, no. 85 p.12873-12876dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4cc05826g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02194naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100003200144245011300176300001600289520103000305592002801335650001701363650001101380650001101391650001601402650002501418651001701443653002101460653002301481653002101504653001401525653003601539653003601575700001901611773010301630856007801733852000901811655001201820IND60481784820221120212635.0160210e20140815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048178482DNAL7 a10.2478/johh-2014-00262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBačová Mitková, Veronika10aJoint modeling of flood peak discharges, volume and duration: a case study of the Danube River in Bratislava  ap. 186-196.  aThe study is focused on the analysis and statistical evaluation of the joint probability of the occurrence of hydrological variables such as peak discharge (Q), volume (V) and duration (t). In our case study, we focus on the bivariate statistical analysis of these hydrological variables of the Danube River in Bratislava gauging station, during the period of 1876-2013. The study presents the methodology of the bivariate statistical analysis, choice of appropriate marginal distributions and appropriate copula functions in representing the joint distribution. Finally, the joint return periods and conditional return periods for some hydrological pairs (Q-V, V-t, Q-t) were calculated. The approach using copulas can reproduce a wide range of correlation (nonlinear) frequently observed in hydrology. Results of this study provide comprehensive information about flood where a devastating effect may be increased in the case where its three basic components (or at least two of them) Q, V and t have the same significance.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3afloods 3amodels 3aprobability 3astatistical analysis 3aDanube River 0aThe Danube River 0aJoint distribution 0aCopula functions 0aPeak flow 0aVolume and duration of the wave 0aMultivariate frequency analysis1 aHalmová, Dana0 tVodohospodársky časopis.g2014 Aug. 15, v. 62, no. 3 p.186-196dDe Gruyter Openx0042-790X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/johh-2014-00263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02900naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002200145245009500167300001600262520165000278592002801928650001501956650001601971650001701987650002902004650001702033650001102050650001502061650001402076650001802090650001402108653000902122653002902131653002102160653001902181700002502200700002402225773015302249856007902402852000902481655001202490IND60522794920221118163235.0160604e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052279492DNAL7 a10.1515/znc-1988-9-10102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchreiber, Ulrich10aMeasuring P700 Absorbance Changes around 830 nm with a New Type of Pulse Modulation System  ap. 686-698.  aA new measuring system for monitoring absorbance changes around 830 n m is described, which was developed by modification of a commercially available pulse modulation fluorometer. All modifications concern the emitter-detector unit of the fluorometer, such that only this unit needs to be exchanged when changing from fluorescence to absorbance measurements and vice versa. The new system is shown to be well-suited for measuring redox changes of P700, the reaction center of photosystem I, in intact leaves and isolated chloroplasts. The observed kinetic changes at 830 nm in response to single turnover or multiple turnover saturating flashes are practically identical to those previously measured around 700 nm . The signal/noise ratio is sufficiently high to give well-resolved kinetics without signal averaging. W h e n P700 is oxidized by far-red background light, valuable information on the state of the intersystem electron transport chain is given by the re-reduction kinetics induced by single or multiple turnover saturating flashes. Such measurements are facilitated by the use of poly-furcated fiberoptics. With intact leaves, almost identical responses are found when measuring through the leaf (transmission mode) or from the leaf surface (remission mode). Modulated chlorophyll fluorescence can be measured in parallel; application of saturation pulses for fluorescence quenching analysis produces transient P700 oxidation without oversaturating the measuring system. The information on the P700 redox state complements that obtained from fluorescence measurements, yielding a new practical tool in plant physiological research.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorbance 3achlorophyll 3achloroplasts 3aelectron transport chain 3afluorescence 3aleaves 3amonitoring 3aoxidation 3aphotosystem I 3aremission 0aP700 0aChlorophyll Fluorescence 0aPulse Modulation 0aPhotosynthesis1 aKlughammer, Christof1 aNeubauer, Christian0 tZeitschrift für Naturforschung.g2014 June 2, v. 43, no. 9-10 p.686-698dVerlag der Zeitschrift für NaturforschungwJournal:23183x1865-71257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/znc-1988-9-10103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02282naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001300153245011100166520110400277592002801381650002801409650001801437650002301455650001301478651001001491653002301501653001901524653003901543653002501582653002001607700005601627700001501683700001501698773011001713856008801823852000901911655001201920IND60760318520221119134412.0220614e20220215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076031852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2021.1060112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDing, Yi12aA novel cost-management system for container terminals using a time-driven Activity-Based Costing approach  aCost-management systems play a significant role in the operations management of container terminal companies; however, in complex loading and discharging operations, traditional Activity-Based Costing (ABC) systems are costly and difficult to be built and maintained. A modified Time-Driven ABC method, considering all the procedures required to obtain the final product and estimating resource usage accordingly, has emerged in response to this challenge. This study provides terminal operators with an effective cost analysis tool using a time-driven ABC method to identify bottleneck in handling process and calculate the handling cost of cost objects. Also, this research uses a container vessel and ten shipping lines calling at Shanghai East Container Terminal as case studies, and presents a full cost analysis of the activities and their respective costs. This investigation provides insights into the causes of excessive logistics costs and highlights the benefits of applying Time-Driven ABC method in the container terminal industry, along with shortcomings and potential future research.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoastal zone management 3acost analysis 3acost effectiveness 3aindustry 3aChina 0aContainer terminal 0aOperating cost 0aTime-driven activity-based costing 0aNon-value-added cost 0aCost management1 aChen, Kaimin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9473-435X1 aWei, Xujun1 aYang, Yang0 tOcean & coastal management.g2022 Feb. 15, v. 217 p.106011-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11975x0964-56917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2021.1060113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01876naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245004600171500001900217520100600236592002801242650001501270650002001285650001901305650001901324650000901343650001801352773012501370856008201495852000901577655001201586IND60732242720221118022235.0210326e20210224xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073224272DNAL7 a10.3390/soilsystems50100132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStrawn, Daniel  G.10aSorption Mechanisms of Chemicals in Soils  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSorption of chemicals onto soil particle surfaces is an important process controlling their availability for uptake by organisms and loss from soils to ground and surface waters. The mechanisms of chemical sorption are inner- and outer-sphere adsorption and precipitation onto mineral surfaces. Factors that determine the sorption behavior are properties of soil mineral and organic matter surfaces and properties of the sorbing chemicals (including valence, electron configuration, and hydrophobicity). Because soils are complex heterogeneous mixtures, measuring sorption mechanisms is challenging; however, advancements analytical methods have made direct determination of sorption mechanisms possible. In this review, historical and modern research that supports the mechanistic understanding of sorption mechanisms in soils is discussed. Sorption mechanisms covered include cation exchange, outer-sphere adsorption, inner-sphere adsorption, surface precipitation, and ternary adsorption complexes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acation exchange 3ahydrophobicity 3aorganic matter 3asoil 3asoil minerals0 tSoil systems.g2021 Feb. 24, v. 5, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27147x2571-87897nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/soilsystems50100133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01928naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245005300168300001600221520082100237592002801058650001201086650001101098650001401109650001601123653001401139653002701153653002401180653001901204653002901223700003501252700006801287700002601355773009101381856008501472852000901557655001201566IND60566468320221116142406.0180830e20160915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056646832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2016.05.1302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShetty, Nitin10aImproved threshold fouling models for crude oils  ap. 453-467.  aThe existing threshold fouling models always predict an increase in initial fouling rates with an increase in bulk temperature which may not hold good for some crude oils.

Some spillways dissipate energy in the form of ski-jump which leads to scouring process. Scour holes formed downstream of spillways may affect the safety and stability of the structure. Therefore accurate prediction of the scour depth is necessary to ensure the safety of dam as well as its abutments. The prediction procedure is extremely complex due to various hydraulic and geological factors influencing scouring phenomenon. Several researchers have developed empirical equations for scour depth predictions, keeping in view the above mentioned factors. It is noted from the literature that there are not many studies to evaluate the efficiency of these equations for scour depth prediction. Therefore, the present study attempts to evaluate different empirical equations available in the literature for scour depth prediction using experimental and field data reported in the literature. For this purpose, a database has been formulated based on the scour depth values reported in the literature.  aPublisher supplied data 3adatabases 3aenergy 3aengineering 3aequations 3afield experimentation 3ageology 3aprediction1 aSreeja, P.0 tEngineering geology.g2012 Mar. 19, v. 129-130 p.98-103dElsevier B.V.x0013-79527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enggeo.2012.01.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02669naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002500148245009800173500001900271520143300290592002801723650001801751650001101769650001401780650001901794650001901813650001201832650001901844650001801863650001201881650001001893650001501903650001801918650001201936650001201948700002201960700002501982700002402007773012502031856008202156852000902238655001202247IND60732242820221118022315.0210326e20210225xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073224282DNAL7 a10.3390/soilsystems50100142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNaumova, Natalia  B.10aUndisturbed Soil Pedon under Birch Forest: Characterization of Microbiome in Genetic Horizons  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aVast areas of land in the forest-steppe of West Siberia are occupied by birch forests, the most common ecosystems there. However, currently, little is known about the microbiome composition in the underlying soil, especially along a sequence of soil genetic horizons. The study aimed at inventorying microbiome in genetic horizons of a typical Phaeozem under undisturbed birch forest in West Siberia. Bacteria and fungi were studied using 16S rRNA genes’ and ITS2 amplicon sequencing with Illumina MiSeq. Proteobacteria and Acidobacteria together accounted for two-thirds of the operational taxonomic units (OTUs) numbers and half of the sequences in each genetic horizon. Acidobacteria predominated in eluvial environments, whereas Proteobacteria, preferred topsoil. The fungal sequences were dominated by Ascomycota and Basidiomycota phyla. Basidiomycota was the most abundant in the topsoil, whereas Ascomycota increased down the soil profile. Thelephoraceae family was the most abundant in the A horizon, whereas the Pyronemataceae family dominants in the AEl horizon, ultimately prevailing in the subsoil. We conclude that soil genetic horizons shape distinct microbiomes, therefore soil horizontation should be accounted for while studying undisturbed soils. This study, representing the first description of bacterio- and mycobiomes in genetic horizons of the Phaeozem profile, provides a reference for future research.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcidobacteria 3aBetula 3aPhaeozems 3aProteobacteria 3aPyronemataceae 3aSiberia 3aThelephoraceae 3aforest steppe 3aforests 3afungi 3amicrobiome 3asoil profiles 3asubsoil 3atopsoil1 aBelanov, Ivan  P.1 aAlikina, Tatiana  Y.1 aKabilov, Marsel  R.0 tSoil systems.g2021 Feb. 25, v. 5, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27147x2571-87897nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/soilsystems50100143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01453naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001900138245007300157300001600230520043000246592002800676650002100704650002300725650002300748650002600771650002500797650001000822700002000832700001900852700001900871700001800890773012600908856007201034852000901106655001201115IND60657487520221122204940.0190816e20040219xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065748752DNAL7 a10.1039/b315348g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJung, Dae-Hwan10aCarbon nanotube conducting arrays by consecutive amidation reactions  ap. 526-527.  aCarbon nanotube conducting arrays were constructed via consecutive amidation reactions with the aid of a linker molecule and a condensation agent on a patterned amine-terminated glass substrate.

Such created agricultural wetlands – termed ‘nitrogen farming wetlands’ (NFWs) – receive nitrogen (N) loads predominantly as nitrate, facilitating N removal by denitrification. However, the conversion of agricultural soils into waterlogged wetland area is likely to increase climate gas emissions, particularly methane (CH₄). There is thus a need to evaluate the benefits and risks of wetland creation at a large, watershed-scale. Here we investigate N retention and CH₄ emission originating from watershed-scale wetland creation in South Sweden, the relation between both processes, and how CH₄ emission depends on individual wetland parameters. We combine data from intensively studied reference wetlands with an extensive wetland survey to predict N retention and CH₄ emission with simple models, to estimate the overall process rates (large-scale effects) as well as spatial variation among individual NFWs. We show that watershed-scale wetland creation serves targeted environmental objectives (N retention), and that CH₄ emission is comparably low. Environmental benefit and risk of individual wetlands were not correlated, and may thus be managed independently. High cover of aquatic plants was the most important wetland property that suppressed CH₄ net production, potentially facilitating N retention simultaneously. Further, differences between wetlands in water temperature and wetland age seemed to contribute to differences in CH₄ net production. The nationally planned wetland creation (12,000ha) could make a significant contribution to the targeted reduction of N fluxes (up to 27% of the Swedish environmental objective), at an environmental risk equaling 0.04% of the national anthropogenic climate gas emission.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3aagricultural soils 3aanthropogenic activities 3aaquatic plants 3aclimate 3adenitrification 3aecosystem engineering 3aecosystem services 3aeutrophication 3afarming systems 3agas emissions 3amethane 3amethane production 3amodels 3anitrates 3anitrogen 3apollution load 3arisk 3aspatial variation 3asurveys 3avegetation cover 3awater temperature 3awetlands 3aSweden1 aStadmark, Johanna1 aWeisner, Stefan E.B.0 tEcological engineering.g2011 Jan., v. 37, no. 1 p.6-15dElsevier B.V.x0925-85747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2009.02.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01205naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002500138245009000163300001600253520027100269592002800540650001100568650001500579650001200594650001400606650001600620700002800636700003100664773012600695856007300821852000900894655001200903IND60657487620221121052613.0190816e20040310xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065748762DNAL7 a10.1039/b315352e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUppadine, Lindsay H.10aProtonic modulation of redox properties in ionisable [2 × 2] grid-like metalloarrays  ap. 718-719.  aThe oxidation state of the cobalt centres can be controlled by modification of the protonation state in [2 × 2] grid-like arrays based on ionisable bis(hydrazone) ligands, allowing conversion of the paramagnetic Coᴵᴵ₄ into the diamagnetic Coᴵᴵᴵ₄ grid.  aPublisher supplied data 3acobalt 3ahydrazones 3aligands 3aoxidation 3aprotonation1 aGisselbrecht, Jean-Paul1 aLehn, J.-M.q(Jean-Marie),0 tChemical communications.g2004 Mar. 10, , no. 6 p.718-719dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b315352e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02656naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245014700170500001900317520135600336592002801692650002001720650001301740650002601753650002501779650001701804650001401821650001801835650001901853650002401872650001501896650001601911650001501927651003001942700002101972700002501993773012502018856008202143961001202225852000902237655001202246IND60732243020221118022338.0210326e20210312xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073224302DNAL7 a10.3390/soilsystems50100162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBailey, Scott  W.10aForest Soil Cation Dynamics and Increases in Carbon on the Allegheny Plateau, PA, USA Following a Period of Strongly Declining Acid Deposition  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aReductions in exchangeable calcium and magnesium and increase in exchangeable aluminum concentrations have been shown in soils impacted by acid deposition, including at four sites on the Allegheny Plateau, PA, USA, sampled in 1967 and 1997 during a period of peak deposition. We repeated sampling at these sites in 2017 to evaluate changes in soils during the more recent period when there has been a strong decline in acid deposition. The uppermost horizons, including the Oa and A horizons where humified organic matter transitions to mineral soil, were thicker, had higher concentrations of organic carbon and exchangeable calcium and magnesium, and lower concentrations of exchangeable aluminum in 2017 compared to 1997, approximating values measured in 1967. Below the Oa/A horizons, 2017 soil chemistry was more similar to the 1997 results, with some reduction of Ca in the recent measurements. These results suggest recovery of base cation–aluminum balance in surface horizons and may indicate a reduction of aluminum mobilization and increased efficiency of vegetation recycling of nutrients with decreased acid anion concentrations. These changes are consistent with a partial recovery from acid deposition. However, the increase in humified soil organic matter may also be affected by coincident increases in temperature and soil moisture.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacid deposition 3aaluminum 3aexchangeable aluminum 3aexchangeable calcium 3aforest soils 3amagnesium 3amineral soils 3aorganic carbon 3asoil organic matter 3asoil water 3atemperature 3avegetation 3aAllegheny Mountain region1 aLong, Robert P.,1 aHorsley, Stephen  B.0 tSoil systems.g2021 Mar. 12, v. 5, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27147x2571-87897nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/soilsystems50100163Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/FS  aDNAL 7aarticle02930naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005700147245008500204520167800289592002801967650002301995650002502018650002402043650003302067650003402100650001902134650001502153653001802168653002602186653002202212653005002234700005302284700005802337773008302395856008102478852000902559655001202568IND60763158620221122105318.0220124s2022    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076315862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mex.2022.1016222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKo, Chang Woo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4676-519110aDeep learning program to predict protein functions based on sequence information  aDeep learning technologies have been adopted to predict the functions of newly identified proteins in silico. However, most current models are not suitable for poorly characterized proteins because they require diverse information on target proteins. We designed a binary classification deep learning program requiring only sequence information. This program was named ‘FUTUSA’ (function teller using sequence alone). It applied sequence segmentation during the sequence feature extraction process, by a convolution neural network, to train the regional sequence patterns and their relationship. This segmentation process improved the predictive performance by 49% than the full-length process. Compared with a baseline method, our approach achieved higher performance in predicting oxidoreductase activity. In addition, FUTUSA also showed dramatic performance in predicting acetyltransferase and demethylase activities. Next, we tested the possibility that FUTUSA can predict the functional consequence of point mutation. After trained for monooxygenase activity, FUTUSA successfully predicted the impact of point mutations on phenylalanine hydroxylase, which is responsible for an inherited metabolic disease PKU. This deep-learning program can be used as the first-step tool for characterizing newly identified or poorly studied proteins.•We proposed new deep learning program to predict protein functions in silico that requires nothing more than the protein sequence information.•Due to application of sequence segmentation, the efficiency of prediction is improved.•This method makes prediction of the clinical impact of mutations or polymorphisms possible.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetyltransferases 3aamino acid sequences 3acomputer simulation 3ainherited metabolic diseases 3aphenylalanine 4-monooxygenase 3apoint mutation 3aprediction 0aDeep learning 0aSequence segmentation 0aProtein functions 0aFUTUSA (function teller using sequence alone)1 aHuh, June1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4610-45211 aPark, Jong-Wan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4676-51910 tMethodsX.g2022, v. 9 p.101622-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23402x2215-01617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mex.2022.1016223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02738naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001500144245013500159300002000294520112700314592002801441650001901469650001301488650001201501650001101513650002701524650002501551650001301576650001801589650002501607650001301632650001601645650002501661653001201686653001701698653002101715700001201736700001601748700005201764700005301816700001901869700005701888700001501945700005501960773014202015856007802157852000902235655001202244IND60677419520221119212156.0191127e20191031xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067741952DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.9b157582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Yuming10aCotton Candy-Templated Fabrication of Three-Dimensional Ceramic Pathway within Polymer Composite for Enhanced Thermal Conductivity  ap. 44700-44707.  aWith the minimization and higher power of electronic devices, materials with effective heat dissipation and high electrical insulation have attracted relentless interest. Especially, highly thermally conductive, highly electrically insulating but low filler content of polymer-based composites are desirable. Herein, a facile and eco-friendly cotton candy-templated method (CTM) to construct three-dimensional heat transport pathways inside epoxy resin is reported. The fabricated Al₂O₃/epoxy composites with enhanced heat transport capability feature a 15-fold increase in thermal conductivity at a filler content of 36.2 vol % compared to pristine epoxy. Moreover, the remarkable thermal conductive property has excellent stability over a wide range of temperature before and after heating and cooling cycles. Meanwhile, the CTM composite still retain highly electrical insulation. The cotton candy-templated method proposed in this work is a new avenue for the preparation of three-dimensional heat transport pathways within polymer-based composites for microelectronic packaging and electrical engineering systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum oxide 3aceramics 3acooling 3acotton 3aelectrical engineering 3aelectronic equipment 3aepoxides 3aheat transfer 3ainsulating materials 3apolymers 3atemperature 3athermal conductivity 0aalumina 0acotton candy 0aepoxy composites1 aYe, Kai1 aLiu, Zhiduo1 aWang, Bo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2270-22411 aYan, Chao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6008-94521 aWang, Zhongwei1 aLin, Cheng-Te1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7090-96101 aJiang, Nan1 aYu, Jinhong1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9134-75680 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2019 Oct. 31, v. 11, no. 47 p.44700-44707dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b157583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01268naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245006900170300001600239520027200255592002800527650001100555650001100566650001100577650001800588651001900606653000800625653001800633653001800651653001500669653001400684700002100698773010500719856008500824852000900909655001200918IND60599841620221121105358.0180702e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059984162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.econlet.2014.10.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNichol, Eoghan10aProfitability and investment factors for UK asset pricing models  ap. 364-366.  aTwo recent asset pricing models share a common core of the addition of profitability and investment as factors, but differ in implementation.

This paper has the following objectives: (i) to review the data concerning the diffusion coefficients of solutes in different cheese types; (ii) to review the experimental methods available to model the mass transfer properties of small solutes in complex matrices such as cheese; and (iii) to consider some potential alternative approaches. Numerous studies have reported the transfer of salt in cheese during brining and ripening. Regardless of the type of cheese and its composition, the effective diffusion coefficients of salt have been reported to be between 1 and 5.3 × 10⁻¹⁰m²·s⁻¹at 10–15 °C. However, few papers have dealt with the mass transfer properties of other small solutes in cheese. Most of the reported effective diffusion coefficient values have been obtained by macroscopic and destructive concentration profile methods. More recently, some other promising techniques, such as nuclear magnetic resonance, magnetic resonance imaging or fluorescence recovery after photobleaching, are currently being developed to measure the mass transfer properties of solutes in heterogeneous media at microscopic scales. However, these methods are still difficult to apply to complex matrices such as cheese. Further research needs to focus on: (i) the development of nondestructive techniques to determine the mass transfer properties of small solutes at a microscopic level in complex matrices such as cheese; and (ii) the determination of the mass transfer properties of metabolites that are involved in enzymatic reactions during cheese ripening.  aPublisher supplied data 3abrining 3acheese ripening 3acheeses 3adiffusivity 3aenzymatic reactions 3afluorescence recovery after photobleaching 3amagnetic resonance imaging 3amass transfer 3ametabolites 3anondestructive methods 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3asolutes1 aJeanson, Sophie1 aAly, Samar1 aLortal, Sylvie0 tDairy science & technology.g2010 July, v. 90, no. 5 p.477-508dSpringer-Verlagx1958-55867nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1051/dst/20100113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02358naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002400146245012700170300002000297520124500317592002801562650001401590650001201604650004901616650002801665650001401693650001701707650001101724700001401735700005501749773013801804856008101942852000902023655001202032IND60756115320221119195734.0211111e20211101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075611532DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c065872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNadupalli, Shankari10aLow-Temperature Surface Phase Transitions in Multiferroic BiFeO₃ Nanocrystals Probed via Electron Paramagnetic Resonance  ap. 24596-24604.  aThe low-temperature phase transitions observed in magnetoelectric bismuth ferrite (BiFeO₃, BFO) have recently been a topic of interest to several researchers. This communication focuses on connecting recent structural revelations, such as the existence of a “skin” layer in BFO, the lattice contraction, and subsequent expansions in the skin layers with X-band electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra. A closer look at Lande’s g-factor and the EPR asymmetry parameters reveal vital information about the origin of the phase transitions at 140, 200, and 280 K. Correlating the EPR results with existing theoretical calculations indicates that oxygen vacancies (VO) accumulate at the skin layer, causing lattice contraction. This contraction causes local changes in the spin magnetic moment and translates to an anomaly in the resonant lines. The discussions imply that the phase transition at 140 K is due to spin reorientation caused by changes of interatomic distances and angles between the FeFₑ₃₊²⁺–VO••–FeFₑ₃₊²⁺ sites. Transition at 200 K is observed to occur due to elastic distortion of the oxygen octahedra. The transition at 280 K is thought to be due to the freezing of spins in the lattice.  aPublisher supplied data 3aasymmetry 3abismuth 3aelectron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aferrimagnetic materials 3amagnetism 3ananocrystals 3aoxygen1 aYan, Feng1 aErdem, Emre1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8395-03640 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2021 Nov. 01, v. 125, no. 44 p.24596-24604dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c065873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03352naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094024002200128024001900150040001800169100002500187245016600212300001400378506007600392520151900468592002801987506003702015650002602052650001702078650002102095650002202116650002302138650001702161650001102178650001702189650001702206650001402223650006602237650001302303650004802316650002602364653001602390653002102406653001602427653002602443653001302469653002202482700002602504700006302530700002202593773010602615856008002721852000902801655001202810IND60598398920221207135214.0180629e20140715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059839892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ab.2014.04.0142doi7 aPMC45126542pmcid7 a247514662pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDoiphode, Prakash G.10aEvaluating factor XIII specificity for glutamine-containing substrates using a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry assay  ap. 74-84.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aActivated factor XIII (FXIIIa) catalyzes the formation of γ-glutamyl-ε-lysyl cross-links within the fibrin blood clot network. Although several cross-linking targets have been identified, the characteristic features that define FXIIIa substrate specificity are not well understood. To learn more about how FXIIIa selects its targets, a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI–TOF MS)-based assay was developed that could directly follow the consumption of a glutamine-containing substrate and the formation of a cross-linked product with glycine ethylester. This FXIIIa kinetic assay is no longer reliant on a secondary coupled reaction, on substrate labeling, or on detecting only the final deacylation portion of the transglutaminase reaction. With the MALDI–TOF MS assay, glutamine-containing peptides derived from α2-antiplasmin, Staphylococcus aureus fibronectin binding protein A, and thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor were examined directly. Results suggest that the FXIIIa active site surface responds to changes in substrate residues following the reactive glutamine. The P−1 substrate position is sensitive to charge character, and the P−2 and P−3 substrate positions are sensitive to the broad FXIIIa substrate specificity pockets. The more distant P−8 to P−11 region serves as a secondary substrate anchoring point. New knowledge on FXIIIa specificity may be used to design better substrates or inhibitors of this transglutaminase.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aactive sites 3abinding proteins 3ablood coagulation 3acatalytic activity 3acrosslinking 3afibrin 3afibrinolysis 3afibronectins 3aglutamine 3amatrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization mass spectrometry 3apeptides 3aprotein-glutamine gamma-glutamyltransferase 3asubstrate specificity 0aFactor XIII 0aTransglutaminase 0aCoagulation 0aSubstrate specificity 0aKinetics 0aMass spectrometry1 aMalovichko, Marina V.1 aMouapi, Kelly Njine1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2429-16181 aMaurer, Muriel C.0 tAnalytical biochemistry.g2014 July 15, v. 457 p.74-84dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11652x0003-26977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ab.2014.04.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02244naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245008600169300001600255520111500271592002801386650001801414650002601432650002001458653005101478653002701529653003101556653003201587653002701619700002301646700001801669700002201687773009101709856008501800852000901885655001201894IND60566468920221116142426.0180830e20160915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056646892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2016.06.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAndré, Maïna10aPredictive spatio-temporal model for spatially sparse global solar radiation data  ap. 599-608.  aThis paper introduces a new approach for the forecasting of solar radiation series at a located station for very short time scale. We built a multivariate model in using few stations (3 stations) separated with irregular distances from 26 km to 56 km. The proposed model is a spatio temporal vector autoregressive VAR model specifically designed for the analysis of spatially sparse spatio-temporal data. This model differs from classic linear models in using spatial and temporal parameters where the available predictors are the lagged values at each station. A spatial structure of stations is defined by the sequential introduction of predictors in the model. Moreover, an iterative strategy in the process of our model will select the necessary stations removing the uninteresting predictors and also selecting the optimal p-order. We studied the performance of this model. The metric error, the relative root mean squared error (rRMSE), is presented at different short time scales. Moreover, we compared the results of our model to simple and well known persistence model and those found in literature.  aPublisher supplied data 3alinear models 3amultivariate analysis 3asolar radiation 0aSatio-temporal vector autoregressive processes 0aGlobal solar radiation 0aStations' spatial ordering 0aSelection of temporal order 0aShort time forecasting1 aDabo-Niang, Sophie1 aSoubdhan, Ted1 aOuld-Baba, Hanany0 tEnergy.g2016 Sept. 15, v. 111 p.599-608dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2016.06.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02503naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245009200170300001600262500001900278520089100297592002801188650001601216650001601232650001801248650001901266650001401285650002201299650001101321650001901332650001401351650001701365650001101382650000901393650002101402650001401423650002001437650001801457651001101475653001501486653002601501653003901527653001401566700002001580700002201600700001701622700001801639700002401657700002901681773014501710856008501855852000901940655001201949IND60730419420221118042558.0210310e20210217xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073041942DNAL7 a10.1080/09637486.2020.17805682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmaral, Yasmin10aDo chronic noncommunicable diseases modify the macronutrient composition of human milk?  ap. 219-225.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis study aims to evaluate the impact of excess body weight, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension on the nutritional composition of human milk.

In the present work, 19 yeast strains, isolated from raw milk, were tested to obtain potential probiotic yeasts for assimilating cholesterol. During in vitro tests, 17 yeast strains were capable of growth in bile salt solutions, and most of the yeast strains tolerated low pH, surviving in gastric juice. Among the 19 strains assessed, Geotrichum sp. BY2 and Pichia kudriavzevii BY10 showed highest adhesive ability to HT-29 cells. All yeast strains were able to assimilate cholesterol in the range of 3.6–44.4% over a 72 h incubation, and seven of the yeast strains were significantly higher at assimilating cholesterol (P < 0.05). According to these results, the yeast strains P.fermentans BY5, P. kudriavzevii BY10, P. kudriavzevii BY15 and Yarrowia lipolytica HY4 may serve as potential probiotics to assimilate cholesterol in the human intestine.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGeotrichum 3aPichia kudriavzevii 3aYarrowia lipolytica 3abile salts 3ablood serum 3acholesterol 3adairy consumption 3adairy science 3agastric juice 3ahumans 3ain vitro studies 3aintestines 3apH 3aprobiotics 3araw milk 3ascreening 3ayeasts1 aMa, Ying1 aMaubois, Jean-Louis1 aHe, Sheng-Hua1 aChen, Li-Jun1 aLi, Hai-Mei0 tDairy science & technology.g2010 July, v. 90, no. 5 p.537-548dSpringer-Verlagx1958-55867nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1051/dst/20100013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01111naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001600138245004300154300001600197520019200213592002800405650001100433650002300444650001500467650001100482650000900493700002000502700002000522700001800542700001800560773012600578856007200704852000900776655001200785IND60657488120221122234334.0190816e20040219xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065748812DNAL7 a10.1039/b315426b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCho, Jin Ku10aSelf-indicating amine scavenger resins  ap. 502-503.  aSelf-indicating methylisocyanate resin, which functions as both a scavenger and an indicator for amines, was used for in-situ reaction monitoring and purification of a urea based library.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamines 3achemical reactions 3amonitoring 3aresins 3aurea1 aWhite, Peter D.1 aKlute, Wolfgang1 aDean, Tony W.1 aBradley, Mark0 tChemical communications.g2004 Feb. 19, , no. 5 p.502-503dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b315426b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01687naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100006700146245009200213300002000305520068100325592002801006650001301034650001501047650002101062650001101083700001601094700005901110773013801169856008101307852000901388655001201397IND60756115520221119195454.0211111e20211029xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075611552DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c067672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQarai, Mohammad Balooch1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0947-055710aUnderstanding Bipolarons in Conjugated Polymers Using a Multiparticle Holstein Approach  ap. 24487-24497.  aA Holstein-based model for mid-IR polaron absorption in π-conjugated polymers with nondegenerate ground states is expanded to include singlet bipolarons. In addition to hole hopping, the model includes electron–vibration coupling involving the prominent aromatic-quinoidal mode, as well as Coulombic interactions between (hole) polarons and between polarons and dopant anions. Compared to single polarons, the mid-IR band for bipolarons is red-shifted by up to 0.2 eV depending on the level of disorder. The red shift reflects the enhanced hole delocalization in the bound bipolaron complex and is in good agreement with recent measurements on electrochemically doped P3HT.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolstein 3aabsorption 3aelectrochemistry 3amodels1 aGhosh, Raja1 aSpano, Frank C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3044-67270 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2021 Oct. 29, v. 125, no. 44 p.24487-24497dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c067673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02088naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245012800170300001300298520109800311592002801409650001701437650001601454650001601470650001101486650001301497651001101510700002001521700001901541700001901560773009001579856008401669852000901753655001201762IND60097516320221119180446.0141104e20120329xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009751632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enggeo.2011.12.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTien, Yong Ming10aIsointensity-isoexposure concept for seismic vulnerability analysis — A case study of the 1999 Chi-Chi, Taiwan earthquake  ap. 1-10.  aFragility curves can be developed using analytical or empirical methods. When the actual building damage records and the associated ground motion data are available, empirical methods are often adopted. Traditionally, district-based records of building damage are analyzed for developing such fragility curves. In this paper, a new procedure based on the concept of “isointensity-isoexposure” is developed. The new procedure is demonstrated through a case study of the building damage records collected from the 1999 Chi-Chi, Taiwan earthquake. The results show that the fragility curves developed with the proposed procedure are more in-line with observations than with the traditional district-based procedure. The developed fragility model may be used for earthquake loss estimation and future emergency planning in the study area. The limitations of the proposed approach include: (1) the developed fragility curves are area-specific and may not be readily applicable to other regions, and (2) ground motion intensity data may not be available at every location in an area of interest.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3aearthquakes 3aengineering 3amodels 3aplanning 3aTaiwan1 aJuang, C.

The present work focuses on optimal sizing of an integrated renewable energy system (IRES) considering locally available different renewable energy sources namely micro hydro, solar, wind, biomass and biogas with battery system for electrification of a remote area in Karnataka state in India. Genetic algorithm (GA) has been used to minimize the total net present cost (TNPC) and cost of energy (COE) of the developed IRES model considering the three decision variables-total active sunshine area occupied by the SPV modules, total swept area required to install wind mills and state of charge (SOC) of battery system. Scenario based results of optimal sizes, TNPC and COE have been obtained based on suitable device types and time schedule of biomass generator. Based on optimization results, three IRE scenarios are proposed for the study area. Of the three, scenario-S1 for zone 2 and zone 3. While, scenario-S2 for zone 1 and zone 4 are found to be most feasible for the study area. Further, optimal time schedule, resource combination and device type for all zones have also been determined.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3abatteries 3abiogas 3abiomass 3aenergy 3amodels 3apeople 3asolar radiation 3awind 3awindmills 3aIndia 0aNet present cost (NPC) 0aGeneric algorithm 0aIntegrated renewable energy optimization model (IREOM) 0aRemote area electrification1 aSaini, R.P.0 tEnergy.g2016 Sept. 15, v. 111 p.803-817dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2016.06.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02488naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245008100168300001600249520113100265592002801396650001901424650002201443650001301465650003201478650001101510650001701521650001201538650002901550650002001579650001801599650001601617650001001633650001101643653003601654653002401690653001801714653002701732653001901759700002201778700001801800700001501818773009101833856008501924852000902009655001202018IND60566469120221116142424.0180830e20160915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056646912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2016.06.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAshrafi, Omid10aHeat recovery optimization in a steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) plant  ap. 981-990.  aPinch Analysis was used to improve the energy performance of a typical steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) process. The objective of this work was to reduce the amount of natural gas used for steam generation in the plant and the associated greenhouse gas emissions. The INTEGRATION software was used to analyze how heat is being used in the existing design and identify inefficient heat exchanges causing excessive use of energy. Several modifications to improve the base case heat exchanger network (HEN) were identified. The proposed retrofit projects reduced the process heating demands by improving the existing heat recovery system and by recovering waste heat and decreased natural gas consumption in the steam production unit by approximately 40 MW, representing approximately 8% of total consumption. As a result, the amount of glycol used to transfer energy across the facility was also reduced, as well as the electricity consumption related to glycol pumping. It was shown that the proposed heat recovery projects reduced natural gas costs by C$3.8 million/y and greenhouse gas emissions by 61,700 t/y of CO2.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3acomputer software 3adrainage 3aelectric energy consumption 3aenergy 3aenergy costs 3agravity 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3aheat exchangers 3aheat transfer 3anatural gas 3asteam 3awastes 0aSteam-assisted gravity drainage 0aProcess integration 0aHeat recovery 0aHeat exchanger network 0aPinch analysis1 aNavarri, Philippe1 aHughes, Robin1 aLu, Dennis0 tEnergy.g2016 Sept. 15, v. 111 p.981-990dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2016.06.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01543naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006200151245004400213300001600257520054600273592002800819650001400847653000800861653000800869653000800877653003700885653002700922653002700949653002000976700002200996773010501018856008501123852000901208655001201217IND60599842120221123003304.0180702e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059984212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.econlet.2014.10.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKédagni, Désiré1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5741-079710aTightening bounds in triangular systems  ap. 455-458.  aThis note discusses partial identification in a nonparametric triangular system with discrete endogenous regressors and nonseparable errors.

Cumulative evidence suggests that the gut microbiota can modulate IFN responses, indirectly determining virological outcomes. This review outlines our current knowledge of the interactions between the gut microbiota and IFN responses and dissects the different mechanisms by which the gut microbiota may alter IFN expression to diverse viral infections. This knowledge offers a basis for translating experimental evidence from animal studies into the human context and identifies avenues for leveraging the gut microbiota–IFN–virus axis to improve control of viral infections and performance of viral vaccines.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadaptive immunity 3adigestive system 3ahumans 3ainnate immunity 3ainterferons 3aintestinal microorganisms 0aantiviral immunity 0abacterial metabolites 0agut microbiota 0ainterferon-α/β 0ainterferon-λ 0aviral infection1 aBaldridge, Megan T.1 aHarris, Vanessa C.0 tTrends in microbiology.g2022 Aug., v. 30, no. 8 p.778-792dElsevier LtdwJournal:6327x0966-842X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tim.2022.01.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02726naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245009500164520123000259592002801489650001701517650001301534650001001547650001601557650002101573650001501594650001901609650001301628650001301641650001101654650000701665650001401672650001701686650000901703650001401712650001601726653001601742653001701758653001401775653001501789653001901804653001701823700001801840700002101858700002601879700002201905700001901927700002001946773012601966856008302092852000902175655001202184IND60779836520221120112627.0220719e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077983652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfca.2022.1046742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAydin, Ziya10aTwo novel enzyme-free colorimetric sensors for the detection of glyphosate in real samples  aThe intensive use and accumulation of glyphosate cause many environmental and ecological problems. There is an urgent need for an effective detection method for glyphosate. Many studies in the literature determine glyphosate by an enzyme-based method, requiring appropriate temperature, pH, substrate and ionic strength. In this study, we presented a simple enzyme-free reaction system. Two new simple Schiff base derivatives, 4-(((3-chloropyridin-4-yl)imino)methyl)-N,N-dimethylaniline (BNP-Cl) and 4-((3-((3-chloropyridin-4-yl)imino)propenyl)-N,N-dimethylaniline (CNP-Cl), were prepared by combining a pyridine moiety with a cinnamaldehyde or a benzaldehyde moiety. The pyridine moiety contains a chlorine atom, and this chlorine atom is replaced by the nitrogen or oxygen of glyphosate (Glyp) in ACN/Tris buffer (pH=8.14, 10 mM, v/v 2:1). This binding caused color changes ranging from colorless to yellow for BNP-Cl and yellow to orange for CNP-Cl. The sensors BNP-Cl and CNP-Cl have a rapid and excellent selectivity for glyphosate with low detection limits (1.78 µM for BNP-Cl and 1.60 µM for CNP-Cl). The sensors were also successfully applied to detect Glyp in real samples such as soil, tap water, and potatoes.  aPublisher supplied data 3abenzaldehyde 3achlorine 3acolor 3acolorimetry 3afood composition 3aglyphosate 3aionic strength 3amoieties 3anitrogen 3aoxygen 3apH 3apyridines 3aschiff bases 3asoil 3atap water 3atemperature 0aSchiff-base 0aColorimetric 0aPesticide 0aGlyphosate 0aReaction-based 0aReal samples1 aAkın, Şeyma1 aÇenet, Esma Nur1 aKeskinateş, Mukaddes1 aAkbulut, Abdullah1 aKeleş, Hülya1 aKeleş, Mustafa0 tJournal of food composition and analysis.g2022 Sept., v. 112 p.104674-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl42192x0889-15757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfca.2022.1046743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02491naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001200152245014100164300001600305520110800321592002801429650003401457650001601491650004301507650002101550650001901571650001301590650002201603650002901625650001201654650001601666653002201682653001001704653000801714653001001722653001201732700002501744700003101769700002201800700002801822773009901850856008701949852000902036655001202045IND60635614720221119064821.0200503e20180530xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063561472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2018.01.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Wen10aNew insight into the unresolved HPLC broad peak of Cabernet Sauvignon grape seed polymeric tannins by combining CPC and Q-ToF approaches  ap. 168-175.  aPolymeric tannins from grapes have always been reported as an unresolved broad peak in HPLC chromatograms, and this has severely limited their identification to date. This study aimed to disassemble this broad peak and explore the polymeric tannin molecules inside. By applying centrifugal partition chromatography (CPC), an efficient separation approach was developed to split the broad peak of grape seed tannins into fractions. Then, the fractions were analyzed by Q-ToF (quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry) to determine the corresponding structures of the tannins. The results suggest that grape seed polymeric tannins were eluted consecutively according to their degree of polymerization (DP). Condensed tannins identified in wine grape seed have a range of DP and degree of galloylation (DG) up to 20 and 11, respectively. The molecular mass of the largest molecule detected was 6067. To our knowledge, this is the first report to offer an insight into the broad peak of polymeric tannins found with HPLC and to characterize the tannins with a DP up to 20 as shown by HRMS and MS/MS data.  aPublisher supplied data 3acountercurrent chromatography 3agrape seeds 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3amolecular weight 3apolymerization 3apolymers 3aproanthocyanidins 3atandem mass spectrometry 3atannins 3awine grapes 0aCondensed tannins 0aGrape 0aCPC 0aQ-ToF 0aPolymer1 aWaffo-Téguo, Pierre1 aAlessandra Paissoni, Maria1 aJourdes, Michäel1 aTeissedre, Pierre-Louis0 tFood chemistry.g2018 May 30, v. 249 p.168-175dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2018.01.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03081naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002500148245021800173506010400391506007600495520132800571592002801899506003701927650001101964650002101975650002901996650002202025650001402047650001402061650001102075650001702086653003402103653001402137653001102151653002502162653002902187653001702216653001602233700002402249700002102273700001502294700001802309700002502327700001702352773012602369856008302495852000902578655001202587IND60779836620221207045807.0220719e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077983662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfca.2022.1046752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTurk, Martina Furdek10aDetermination of 87Sr/86Sr isotopic ratio in olive oil and pomace using multicollector-ICPMS: Analysis of pomace residues as a simpler approach for determination of 87Sr/86Sr ratio in olive oil with low Sr content  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThis study presents an analytical procedure for measuring the ⁸⁷Sr/⁸⁶Sr isotopic ratio in olive oil and pomace using multicollector-inductively coupled mass spectrometry (MC-ICPMS). The developed method combines liquid-liquid extraction with an acid solution and degradation of organic residues in the extract by dry ashing and oxidation by H₂O₂ and HNO₃. The method enabled ⁸⁷Sr/⁸⁶Sr ratios to be obtained in olive oil with Sr content as low as 0.2 ng g⁻¹, with a precision of 54 ppm. The method’s validity was confirmed by an interlaboratory comparison using NIST SRM 2387, providing the first data on its elemental Sr (2380 ± 230 ng g⁻¹; n = 10), and ⁸⁷Sr/⁸⁶Sr isotopic composition (0.70908 ± 0.00004; n = 14). The procedure was applied to olive oil and pomace samples, showing that they have an identical ⁸⁷Sr/⁸⁶Sr ratio, which was consistent with that determined in soils from the same orchards. The results thus revealed that Sr isotopic ratios of olive oil and pomace can both be used in geographical traceability studies of olive oil, which means that, instead of processing large volume of oil, characteristic ⁸⁷Sr/⁸⁶Sr signatures of olive oil can be more easily obtained by analyzing small quantities of pomace obtained by centrifuging the oil.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aashing 3afood composition 3aliquid-liquid extraction 3amass spectrometry 3aolive oil 3aoxidation 3apomace 3atraceability 0aSr isotopic ratio (87Sr/86Sr) 0aOlive oil 0aPomace 0aMulticollector-ICPMS 0aLiquid-liquid extraction 0aTraceability 0aFood origin1 aEpova, Ekaterina N.1 aPošćić, Filip1 aNasr, Emna1 aBarre, Julien1 aDonard, Olivier F.X.1 aZuliani, Tea0 tJournal of food composition and analysis.g2022 Sept., v. 112 p.104675-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl42192x0889-15757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfca.2022.1046753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02361naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002600150245008600176300001800262520094400280592002801224650001901252650001201271650001101283650001301294650002501307650002201332650000901354650000901363650001101372650001301383650001601396653002501412653004101437653003101478653003601509700002401545700002101569700002201590700002001612700001901632700002201651773012501673856008401798852000901882655001201891IND60122358620221121102513.0150325e20141015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012235862DNAL7 a10.1080/10934529.2014.9285432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChanturiya, Valentine10aGeochemical barriers for environment protection and recovery of nonferrous metals  ap. 1409-1415.  aA study of natural minerals, ore tailings and their products as materials for artificial geochemical barriers is presented. In particular, it focuses on interaction between calcite and dolomite and sulfate solutions containing nickel, copper and iron under static conditions. Calcite of −0.1 mm fraction has been shown to perform well as a barrier when added to water phases of tailing dumps and natural reservoirs. Experiments under dynamic conditions have revealed a high potential of thermally activated copper-nickel tailings as barriers. After a 500-day precipitating period on a geochemical barrier, the contents of nickel and copper in ore dressing tailings were found to increase 12- and 28-fold, respectively. An effective sorbent of copper, iron and nickel ions is a brucite-based product of hydrochloric acid treatment of vermiculite ore tailings. Its sorption capacity can be essentially increased through thermal activation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacid treatment 3acalcite 3acopper 3adolomite 3aenvironmental health 3ahydrochloric acid 3aions 3airon 3anickel 3asorption 3avermiculite 0aGeochemical barriers 0amanagement of natural and wastewater 0anonferrous metal reduction 0aphysicochemical geotechnologies1 aMasloboev, Vladimir1 aMakarov, Dmitriy1 aNesterov, Dmitriy1 aBajurova, Julia1 aSvetlov, Anton1 aMen'shikov, Yuriy0 tJournal of environmental science and health.g2014 Oct. 15, v. 49, no. 12 p.1409-1415dTaylor & Francisx1532-41177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10934529.2014.9285433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02607naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245010400168520131800272592002801590650002301618650001501641650001201656650001901668650001301687650001201700650001401712650001101726650001301737650001001750653002701760653001201787653001501799653002401814653001801838700001601856700001501872700001401887700001901901700001601920700002301936773009601959856008502055852000902140655001202149IND60767756820221121112439.0220523e20220501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076775682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.watres.2022.1182012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Chengyang12aA kinetic model for 2,4-dichlorophenol adsorption and hydrodechlorination over a palladized biofilm  aAdsorption and catalytic hydrodechlorination (HDC) of aqueous 2,4-DCP by palladium nanoparticles (Pd⁰NPs) associated with a biofilm (i.e., a Pd⁰-biofilm) was investigated in terms of the removal efficiency of 2,4-DCP, dechlorinated product selectivity, and reduction kinetics. Experiments were executed with Pd⁰-biofilm and with abiotic Pd⁰NPs-film alone. The 2,4-DCP-adsorption capacity of Pd⁰-biofilm was 2- to 5-fold greater than that of abiotic Pd⁰NPs-film, and the adsorption accelerated dechlorination by Pd⁰-biofilm, including selectivity to phenol instead of mono-chlorophenols. A mechanistic kinetic model was developed to represent the sequential adsorption and reduction processes. Modeling results represented well the removal of 2,4-DCP and quantified that Pd⁰-biofilm had a strong affinity for adsorbing 2,4-DCP. The strong adsorption increased the volume-averaged concentration of 2,4-DCP concentration inside the Pd⁰-biofilm, compared to the concentration in the bulk liquid. This increase in the local concentration of 2,4-DCP led to a 2- to 4-fold increase in the reduction rate of 2,4-DCP in Pd⁰-biofilm, compared to abiotic Pd⁰NPs-film. Thus, coupling Pd⁰NPs with the biofilm promoted 2,4-DCP removal and full dechlorination despite its low concentration in bulk water.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,4-dichlorophenol 3aadsorption 3abiofilm 3adechlorination 3akinetics 3aliquids 3apalladium 3aphenol 3aresearch 3awater 0aPalladium nanoparticle 0aBiofilm 0aAdsorption 0aHydrodechlorination 0aKinetic model1 aZhou, Luman1 aZhou, Chen1 aZhou, Yun1 aZhou, Jingzhou1 aXia, Siqing1 aRittmann, Bruce E.0 tWater research.g2022 May 01, v. 214 p.118201-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1966x0043-13547nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2022.1182013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02782naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094024002200131024001900153040001800172100002300190245007200213300001300285506007600298520109600374592002801470506003701498650001501535650002101550650001501571650001701586650001201603650002601615650001801641650002401659653000801683653000701691653000901698653000901707653000801716653001101724653000801735653000801743653000801751653000701759653000701766653000801773653000801781653000801789653000801797653000801805653002401813653001801837653001901855653002401874653001001898653001101908700002301919773011001942856008302052852000902135655001202144IND60599058320221207112736.0180702e20141001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059905832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ydbio.2014.08.0032doi7 aPMC41829262pmcid7 a251279922pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aManning, Alyssa J.14aThe Fog signaling pathway: Insights into signaling in morphogenesis  ap. 6-14.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aEpithelia form the building blocks of many tissue and organ types. Epithelial cells often form a contiguous 2-dimensional sheet that is held together by strong adhesions. The mechanical properties conferred by these adhesions allow the cells to undergo dramatic three-dimensional morphogenetic movements while maintaining cell–cell contacts during embryogenesis and post-embryonic development. The Drosophila Folded gastrulation pathway triggers epithelial cell shape changes that drive gastrulation and tissue folding and is one of the most extensively studied examples of epithelial morphogenesis. This pathway has yielded key insights into the signaling mechanisms and cellular machinery involved in epithelial remodeling. In this review, we discuss principles of morphogenesis and signaling that have been discovered through genetic and cell biological examination of this pathway. We also consider various regulatory mechanisms and the system׳s relevance to mammalian development. We propose future directions that will continue to broaden our knowledge of morphogenesis across taxa.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDrosophila 3aepithelial cells 3aepithelium 3agastrulation 3amammals 3amechanical properties 3amorphogenesis 3asignal transduction 0aFog 0aTF 0aGPCR 0aMist 0aCta 0aRhoGEF 0aRok 0aPMG 0aGBE 0aVF 0aMT 0aGRK 0aKrz 0aGAP 0aDia 0aAbl 0aApical constriction 0aMorphogenesis 0aCell signaling 0aFolded gastrulation 0aActin 0aMyosin1 aRogers, Stephen L.0 tDevelopmental biology.g2014 Oct. 01, v. 394, no. 1 p.6-14dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12382x0012-16067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ydbio.2014.08.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02923naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003400092040001800126100002000144245007900164300001600243500000900259520165200268592002801920650001001948650001901958650001901977650001701996650002602013650002202039650002202061650002302083650001102106650002302117650001302140650000902153650001602162650001302178650002802191651000902219700001902228700001802247773012202265852000902387856008102396655001202477IND4392378120221120231839.0191226e200701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439237812DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj2005.0116S2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHatfield, J.

Quantifying the spatial and temporal variation in the energy balance and CO₂ dynamics over crop canopies will improve regional-scale estimates of water and C fluxes. A study was conducted in central Iowa during 2002 as part of the Soil Moisture Experiment to evaluate soil moisture energy exchange across an intensive corn (Zea mays L.) and soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] production area near Ames, IA (lat. 41.98380985, long. −93.75497316). Surface energy balance and CO₂ flux stations were placed in 12 corn and soybean fields across different soils and landscapes in and around the Walnut Creek watershed. Variability among fields was induced by three factors. Within a day, variations among fields were due to the presence of cumulus cloud formation in the afternoon. Short-term differences across days among the fields were due to variation in the spatial pattern of rainfall events causing differential drying. Throughout the season, differences among fields were due to soil water availability, which affected crop growth and ground cover. Differences in early season ground cover were correlated with energy balance (r = 0.80). During the growing season, latent heat and CO₂ uptake were closely related (r = 0.85). Characterization of the spatial distribution of energy balance and CO₂ uptake in an intensive cropping region provides guidance on the confidence that can be placed in interpreting single-site measurements.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrops 3aenergy balance 3acarbon dioxide 3agas exchange 3afield experimentation 3ameasuring devices 3aspatial variation 3atemporal variation 3acanopy 3asoil water content 3aZea mays 3acorn 3aGlycine max 3asoybeans 3aagricultural watersheds 3aIowa1 aPrueger, J.

We assessed the association of drinking water trihalomethanes (THM), a proxy for chlorination by-products, with risk of bladder cancer in 58,672 men and women. Data came from two population-based cohorts, parts of the Swedish Infrastructure for Medical Population-Based Life-Course and Environmental Research (SIMPLER). Individual exposure to THM was assessed by combining residential information with tap water monitoring data. Participants were categorized into non-exposed, low (<15 µg/L) or high (≥15 µg/L) THM exposure. Incident cases were ascertained from 1998 through 2019 via register linkage. During 16 years of follow-up (965,590 person-years), 831 bladder cancer cases were ascertained. We observed no overall association of THM with risk of bladder cancer, hazard ratio for the highest exposed compared to the non-exposed 0.90 (95% confidence interval: 0.73 – 1.11). The null association remained after restricting the analysis to long-term residents and across strata of smoking status and cancer stage. Our results indicate that chlorination by-product exposure at THM concentrations representative of chlorinated drinking waters in most European countries, is not associated with an increased risk of bladder cancer.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abyproducts 3achlorination 3acohort studies 3aconfidence interval 3ahazard ratio 3ainfrastructure 3aresearch 3arisk 3atap water 3aurinary bladder neoplasms 3awater 0aChlorination by-products 0aDisinfection by-products 0aTrihalomethanes 0aBladder cancer 0aCohort 0aPopulation-based1 aSäve-Söderbergh, Melle1 aUgge, Henrik1 aFall, Katja1 aLarsson, Susanna C1 aÅkesson, Agneta1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9594-41400 tWater research.g2022 May 01, v. 214 p.118202-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1966x0043-13547nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2022.1182023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01551naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245007400165300001600239520044200255592002800697650001700725650001700742650002000759650002200779653001900801653008200820653002400902653002600926653001700952700001800969700001500987773010801002856008201110852000901192655001201201IND60764029320221118235921.0220314e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076402932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tim.2022.01.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Haiqian10aMicrobial redox coenzyme engineering and applications in biosynthesis  ap. 318-321.  aMany biosynthetic processes, either in vivo or in vitro, involve redox reactions catalyzed by oxidoreductases – which depend on coenzymes as electron carriers.

Ultrasonic power, treatment duration, sludge-to-water ratio, and initial sludge-water slurry temperature were examined for their impacts on sludge treatment. It was found that the increased initial slurry temperature could enhance the ultrasonic irradiation performance, especially at lower ultrasonic power level (i.e., 21 W), but the application of higher-power ultrasound could rapidly increase the bulk temperature of slurry. Ultrasonic irradiation had a better oil recovery and salt removal performance than direct heating treatment. More than 60% of PHCs in the sludge was recovered at an ultrasonic power of 75 W, a treatment duration of 6 min, an initial slurry temperature of 25°C, and a sludge-to-water ratio of 1:4, while salt content in the recovered oil was reduced to <5 mg L ⁻¹, thereby satisfying the salt requirement in refinery feedstock oil. In general, ultrasonic irradiation could be an effective method in terms of oil recovery and salt removal from refinery oily sludge, but the separated wastewater still contains relatively high concentrations of PHCs and salt which requires proper treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenvironmental health 3afeedstocks 3aheat 3airradiation 3aoils 3asalt content 3asludge 3aslurries 3atemperature 3aultrasonics 3awastewater 0aOil recovery 0aoily sludge 0apetroleum hydrocarbons 0asalt removal 0aultrasonic irradiation1 aLi, Jianbing1 aThring, Ronald W.1 aArocena, Joselito0 tJournal of environmental science and health.g2014 Oct. 15, v. 49, no. 12 p.1425-1435dTaylor & Francisx1532-41177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10934529.2014.9285563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02968naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001300144245017900157300001800336500002000354520166200374592002802036650001502064650001502079650001502094650001402109650004302123650001902166650001402185650003502199650002702234650002302261650001602284700001502300700001602315700001802331773013402349856007802483852000902561655001202570IND60589127920221122040931.0180202e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058912792DNAL7 a10.1002/jssc.2017000942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Ying10aEvaluation of a mixed anionic–nonionic surfactant modified eggshell membrane as an advantageous adsorbent for the solid‐phase extraction of Sudan I–IV as model analytes  ap. 2591-2602.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe coadsorption of mixed anionic–nonionic surfactants, sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate with Triton X‐100, on the surface of eggshell membrane was investigated based on adsorption isotherms to improve the solid‐phase extraction performance of eggshell membrane toward organic contaminants. Results showed that even though excess Triton X‐100 might inhibit the adsorption of sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate, a low dosage of Triton X‐100 can significantly improve sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate modification and enhance the extraction efficiency of eggshell membrane from 73.7 to 100.4% because of the formation of mixed hemimicelles. The highest recovery was achieved at 2:8 (Triton X‐100/sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate mass ratios), and multiple mechanisms involving π–π interactions, hydrophobic effect, and π–π electron donor–acceptor interactions contributed to the strong extraction affinity. When mixed, the Triton X‐100 and sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate modified eggshell membrane packed cartridge coupled with high‐performance liquid chromatography was applied for the simultaneous determination of trace Sudan I–IV, and low detection limits (0.16–0.26 ng/L) were achieved with satisfactory linearity (R² > 0.999) in 10–10 000 μg/L. For real samples, Sudan II and III in one chilli sauce sample were found at 4.3 and 1.7 μg/kg. Sudan I–IV recoveries at three spiked levels were 87.4–102.9% with precisions <6.8%. Comparison with commonly used solid‐phase extraction adsorbents and methods further reflected the superiorities of the proposed adsorbent in sensitivity, retention ability, and applicability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSudan dyes 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aegg shell 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahydrophobicity 3aoctoxynol 3asodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate 3asolid phase extraction 3asorption isotherms 3asurfactants1 aWang, Anyi1 aBai, Yunfei1 aWang, Shiping0 tJournal of separation science.g2017 June, v. 40, no. 12 p.2591-2602dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3924049x1615-93067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jssc.2017000943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04053naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245014600164520241200310592002802722650001802750650001402768650001802782650001902800650001602819650001902835650002102854650001502875650001202890650001302902650002302915650002502938650002302963650002002986650002503006650001303031650001303044650001303057650001303070650001003083653003403093653001803127653002103145653001203166653001403178653002103192700002203213700002603235700001903261700001703280773009603297856008503393852000903478655001203487IND60767757020221120132543.0220523e20220501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076775702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.watres.2022.1182032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Boyan10aEnriched autoinducer-2 (AI-2)-based quorum quenching consortium in a ceramic anaerobic membrane bioreactor (AnMBR) for biofouling retardation  aThis study is the first to enrich a facultative QQ consortium for AI-2-based quorum sensing (QS) disruption (FQQ2) and discover its quorum quenching (QQ) performance in an anaerobic membrane bioreactor (AnMBR) for membrane fouling retardation. Herein, FQQ2 was enriched by the enrichment culture using 4,5-dihydroxy-2,3-pentanedione (DPD) followed by anaerobic screening. FQQ2 was composed of various facultative AI-2-based QQ microorganisms including Acinetobacter, Comamonas, Stenotrophomonas, and FQQ2 was capable to degrade 96.96% of DPD in 9 h. More importantly, FQQ2 prolonged membrane filtration operation by an average of 3.72 times via reduction of DPD in the AnMBR treating domestic wastewater (p ≤ 0.05). QQ was implicated to reduce the content of proteins and carbohydrates of the extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) of suspended biomass by 24.16% and 10.39%, respectively, and concentration of proteins of the soluble microbial products (SMP) by 18.77%. Parallel factor (PARAFAC) modelling of excitation-emission matrix (EEM) demonstrated that QQ could reduce the content of fulvic acid-like and humic acid-like substances, aromatic proteins and soluble-microbial-by-product-like proteins of the EPS (p ≤ 0.05) and abate the content of soluble-microbial-by-product-like proteins in the SMP (p ≤ 0.05). The lower EPS content of suspended biomass could be rendered with the reduced relative abundance of AI-2-regulated Christensenellaceae;g-, Hyphomicrobium, Leucobacter and Microbacterium by 48.48%, 76.56%, 64.78% and 59.26%, respectively, and QQ led to the reduction of the relative abundance of Christensenellaceae;g- and Leucobacter in the cake layer by 31.07% and 51.43%, respectively. Moreover, quantity of organics as well as planktonic microorganisms in the supernatant decreased in presence of FQQ2 (p ≤ 0.05). Of note, markedly lower relative abundance of AI-2-regulated Sulfurovum in supernatant by 97.74% resulted in its lower abundance of cake layer. Intriguingly, in the presence of QQ, methane production was statistically enhanced by 62.5% (p ≤ 0.05). It was closely linked to the decrease of sulfate reduction (p ≤ 0.05), which resulted from 37.93% lower abundance of sulfate-reduction Desulfomonile in the suspended biomass (p ≤ 0.05). Collectively, this study sheds lights on the development of AI-2-based QQ for biofouling control in AnMBRs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcinetobacter 3aComamonas 3aDesulfomonile 3aHyphomicrobium 3aLeucobacter 3aMicrobacterium 3aStenotrophomonas 3abiofouling 3abiomass 3aceramics 3aenrichment culture 3amembrane bioreactors 3amethane production 3amicrofiltration 3amunicipal wastewater 3aplankton 3apolymers 3aresearch 3asulfates 3awater 0aAnaerobic membrane bioreactor 0aAutoinducer-2 0aCeramic membrane 0aFouling 0aPlanktons 0aQuorum quenching1 aCho, Qi An Celine1 aNg, Tze Chiang Albert1 aHuang, Shujuan1 aNg, How Yong0 tWater research.g2022 May 01, v. 214 p.118203-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1966x0043-13547nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2022.1182033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03179naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001500149245012800164300001600292520169300308592002802001650001402029650002402043650001202067650000902079650002002088650001002108650002002118650000902138650001202147650001102159650001802170650002002188650001502208650002602223653000902249653001202258653001402270653001402284653001502298653002902313653000802342653001802350653001802368653002102386700001502407700002202422773011302444856008302557852000902640655001202649IND60599058520221122234607.0180702e20141015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059905852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ydbio.2014.08.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuan, Qing14aThe Pax6 genes eyeless and twin of eyeless are required for global patterning of the ocular segment in the Tribolium embryo  ap. 367-381.  aThe transcription factor gene Pax6 is widely considered a master regulator of eye development in bilaterian animals. However, the existence of visual organs that develop without Pax6 input and the considerable pleiotropy of Pax6 outside the visual system dictate further studies into defining ancestral functions of this important regulator. Previous work has shown that the combinatorial knockdown of the insect Pax6 orthologs eyeless (ey) and twin of eyeless (toy) perturbs the development of the visual system but also other areas of the larval head in the red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum. To elucidate the role of Pax6 during Tribolium head development in more detail, we studied head cuticle morphology, brain anatomy, embryonic head morphogenesis, and developmental marker gene expression in combinatorial ey and toy knockdown animals. Our experiments reveal that Pax6 is broadly required for patterning the anterior embryonic head. One of the earliest detectable roles is the formation of the embryonic head lobes, which originate from within the ocular segment and give rise to large parts of the supraesophageal brain including the mushroom body, a part of the posterior head capsule cuticle, and the visual system. We present further evidence that toy continues to be required for the development of the larval eyes after formation of the embryonic head lobes in cooperation with the eye developmental transcription factor dachshund (dac). The sum of our findings suggests that Pax6 functions as a competence factor throughout the development of the insect ocular segment. Comparative evidence identifies this function as an ancestral aspect of bilaterian head development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDachshund 3aTribolium castaneum 3aanimals 3aeyes 3agene expression 3agenes 3agenetic markers 3ahead 3ainsects 3alarvae 3amorphogenesis 3amushroom bodies 3apleiotropy 3atranscription factors 0aPax6 0aEyeless 0aDachshund 0aTribolium 0aDrosophila 0aEvolution of development 0aEye 0aVisual system 0aMushroom body 0aBilaterian brain1 aChen, Qing1 aFriedrich, Markus0 tDevelopmental biology.g2014 Oct. 15, v. 394, no. 2 p.367-381dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12382x0012-16067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ydbio.2014.08.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02835naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245007400169300001600243520134400259536011901603592002801722596001701750650004301767650002601810650002501836650001301861650002701874650001801901650002701919650001301946650001701959650002101976653002201997653002402019653001002043653003502053700001802088700001602106700001702122700001502139773012802154856008602282852000902368655001202377IND60768585820221117055351.0220225e20220403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076858582DNAL7 a10.1080/15320383.2021.19264182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShi, Yongning12aA Pretreatment Method for Analysis of Available Tetracycline in Soils  ap. 265-281.  aA pretreatment method for detecting the available (water-soluble) tetracycline (TC) contents in soils was developed using a molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) synthesized with TC as the template. The infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and TC sorption isotherms revealed a specific TC binding with the synthesized MIP in water. Upon extraction and concentration from water by the MIP, the target TC could be directly analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The parameters for the pretreatment method were optimized with TC-spiked water and soils, with observed TC recoveries from water and soils equal to 74.7 ± 4.6% to 95.5 ± 6.5% (n = 3) and 48.1 ± 3.3% to 72.1 ± 2.7% (n = 3), respectively. The detected available TC contents in three test soil samples were in the range of 2.3 ± 0.1 to 3.0 ± 0.1 μg/kg (n = 3), only13.8%-39.4% of the TC contents detected by the conventional solvent-extraction method coupled with a solid-phase extraction (SPE) technique. The observed TC distribution in a vertical soil profile indicated that the proposed method for available antibiotic content coupled with the total extracted antibiotic content via the conventional (organic-solvent) extraction can be utilized to evaluate the available TC level and its mobility in contaminated soils.  aThis research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41361072, 21667028 and U1403381).  aPublisher supplied data  aNo. 41361072 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ainfrared spectroscopy 3amolecular imprinting 3apolymers 3asediment contamination 3asoil profiles 3asolid phase extraction 3asorption 3atetracycline 3awater solubility 0aavailable content 0apretreatment method 0asoils 0amolecularly imprinted polymers1 aWang, Yixiang1 aCao, Haiyan1 aShan, Xinxin1 aSu, Yuhong0 tSoil & sediment contamination.g2022 Apr. 03, v. 31, no. 3 p.265-281dTaylor & FranciswJournal:J000000152x1549-78877nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15320383.2021.19264183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02742naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245012600157300002000283520164400303592002801947650002201975650001901997650003402016650001102050650003702061700001902098700002202117700001902139700001802158700002002176773012502196856007402321852000902395655001202404IND60666929120221122183904.0190919e20141114xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066692912DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra10446c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPark, Jingyu10aSpatially confined electric field effect for improved resistive switching behavior of a Ni/Ta-embedded TaOₓ/NiSi device  ap. 61064-61067.  aIn this study, Ni/TaOₓ/NiSi and Ni/TaOₓ/Ta/TaOₓ/NiSi devices were fabricated, and the resistive switching (RS) behaviors were investigated.

Phytoextraction with hyperaccumulator Tagetes patula (T.patula) has great promise for the cadmium (Cd) removal from contaminated soils. However, there is lack of information about the effects of soil types with different properties on the phytoextraction efficiency and the associated bacterial communities. A pot experiment was performed for 90 d, with four types of soil (black soil, paddy soil, oasis soil, and fluvo-aquic soil) artificially contaminated with Cd at 10 mg kg⁻¹ soil. T.patula showed the greatest Cd uptake efficiency in black soil, followed by paddy soil, oasis soil and fluvo-aquic soil, respectively. Across the four soils, soil pH had the strongest impact on Cd bioaccumulation in T.patula. The Cd uptake amount in T.patula shoot positively correlated with soil CEC, organic matter, total N, total P and total K, and negatively correlated with soil pH and soil particle size. Black soil showed the highest diversity of bacterial community, followed by the paddy, oasis, and fluvo-aquic soils. The structure of communities was altered after phytoremediation albeit to a small degree. Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Chloroflexi, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Planctomycetes, Gemmatimonadetes, and Bacteroidetes dominated the four soils with different abundances. Soil particle size and CEC had significant negative and positive effects on the richness of the bacterial communities, respectively. These results are important to develop the application of phytoremediation by T. patula in a wide range of Cd-contaminated soils.  aThis work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [31600411].  aPublisher supplied data  a31600411 3aAcidobacteria 3aActinobacteria 3aBacteroidetes 3aChloroflexi 3aFirmicutes 3aGemmatimonadetes 3aPlanctomycetes 3aProteobacteria 3aTagetes patula 3abacterial communities 3aheavy metals 3ahyperaccumulators 3aoases 3aorganic matter 3apaddies 3apaddy soils 3aparticle size 3aphytoaccumulation 3asediment contamination 3asoil pH 3atotal nitrogen 0aBacterial community 0acadmium 0asoil property 0asoil type 0aphytoextraction1 aDu, Junjie0 tSoil & sediment contamination.g2022 Apr. 03, v. 31, no. 3 p.282-292dTaylor & FranciswJournal:J000000152x1549-78877nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15320383.2021.19264203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02605naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245013300154300002000287520124500307592002801552650002201580650001501602650000901617650001001626650001901636650001401655650001901669650001901688650001501707650002901722650003301751650001101784650002001795650003701815700001401852700001301866700001701879700001801896700001401914700001201928773012401940856007402064852000902138655001202147IND60667208920221119224148.0190919e20150209xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066720892DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra15821k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYan, Qing10aFabrication of a heterostructured Ag/AgCl/Bi₂MoO₆ plasmonic photocatalyst with efficient visible light activity towards dyes  ap. 17245-17252.  aA ternary Ag/AgCl/Bi₂MoO₆ plasmonic photocatalyst was successfully fabricated through a two-step synthesis method. The obtained samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS). The DRS results showed that the visible light absorption of the Ag/AgCl/Bi₂MoO₆ composite had been greatly enhanced owing to the surface plasmonic resonance (SPR) of Ag⁰ particles. The SEM and TEM images showed that the obtained flower-like Bi₂MoO₆ microspheres were composed of nanoplates, on the surface of which Ag/AgCl particles were distributed. In the photocatalytic degradation of dyes, Ag/AgCl/Bi₂MoO₆ photocatalysts exhibited significantly enhanced activities compared with Bi₂MoO₆. It was also found that the components of Ag/AgCl/Bi₂MoO₆ have a great influence on the activity. Controlled experiments proved that the degradation of pollutants over Ag/AgCl/Bi₂MoO₆ was mainly ascribed to the strong oxidation ability of photo-generated holes. On the basis of band structure analysis and active species trapping experimental results, a photocatalytic mechanism is also proposed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aabsorption 3adyes 3alight 3amicroparticles 3aoxidation 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3apollutants 3areflectance spectroscopy 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asilver 3asilver chloride 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aSun, Meng1 aYan, Tao1 aLi, Mengmeng1 aYan, Liangguo1 aWei, Dong1 aDu, Bin0 tRSC advances.g2015 Feb. 09, v. 5, no. 22 p.17245-17252dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ra15821k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03547naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002100186245009500207300002000302506007600322520168700398592002802085506003702113650002502150650001702175650002202192650002102214650001202235650001502247650001202262650001702274650001902291650002002310650002102330650002102351650001902372650001202391650001102403650002002414650002202434650001702456650003002473653003102503653002602534653002602560700001802586700002202604700002802626700001902654700002002673773017602693856007902869852000902948655001202957IND60178484620221207114837.0150604e20131217xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017848462DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.13129751102doi7 aPMC38707132pmcid7 a242978992pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVeneziano, Rémi10aBordetella pertussis adenylate cyclase toxin translocation across a tethered lipid bilayer  ap. 20473-20478.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aNumerous bacterial toxins can cross biological membranes to reach the cytosol of mammalian cells, where they exert their cytotoxic effects. Our model toxin, the adenylate cyclase (CyaA) from Bordetella pertussis , is able to invade eukaryotic cells by translocating its catalytic domain directly across the plasma membrane of target cells. To characterize its original translocation process, we designed an in vitro assay based on a biomimetic membrane model in which a tethered lipid bilayer (tBLM) is assembled on an amine-gold surface derivatized with calmodulin (CaM). The assembled bilayer forms a continuous and protein-impermeable boundary completely separating the underlying calmodulin (trans side) from the medium above (cis side). The binding of CyaA to the tBLM is monitored by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) spectroscopy. CyaA binding to the immobilized CaM, revealed by enzymatic activity, serves as a highly sensitive reporter of toxin translocation across the bilayer. Translocation of the CyaA catalytic domain was found to be strictly dependent on the presence of calcium and also on the application of a negative potential, as shown earlier in eukaryotic cells. Thus, CyaA is able to deliver its catalytic domain across a biological membrane without the need for any eukaryotic components besides CaM. This suggests that the calcium-dependent CyaA translocation may be driven in part by the electrical field across the membrane. This study’s in vitro demonstration of toxin translocation across a tBLM provides an opportunity to explore the molecular mechanisms of protein translocation across biological membranes in precisely defined experimental conditions.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBordetella pertussis 3aactive sites 3aadenylate cyclase 3abacterial toxins 3acalcium 3acalmodulin 3acytosol 3acytotoxicity 3aelectric field 3aenzyme activity 3aeukaryotic cells 3ain vitro studies 3alipid bilayers 3amammals 3amodels 3aplasma membrane 3aprotein transport 3aspectroscopy 3asurface plasmon resonance 0aadenylate cyclase activity 0asynthetic biomembrane 0atoxin internalization1 aRossi, Claire1 aChenal, Alexandre1 aDevoisselle, Jean-Marie1 aLadant, Daniel1 aChopineau, Joel0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2013 Dec. 17, v. 110, no. 51 p.20473-20478dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.13129751103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02796naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002700149245012000176300001600296520140600312592002801718650001501746650001201761650001701773650000701790650001401797650001801811650001801829650002201847650002001869650001101889650001701900650001201917653001501929653001801944653001701962653001701979653003101996653001402027700001902041700002002060700002802080773012502108856008402233852000902317655001202326IND60633961620221119211032.0190529e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063396162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.syapm.2019.02.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aL’Haridon, Stéphane10aMarinitoga lauensis sp. nov., a novel deep-sea hydrothermal vent thermophilic anaerobic heterotroph with a prophage  ap. 343-347.  aA novel moderately thermophilic, heterotrophic anaerobe, designated strain LG1T, was isolated from the Mariner deep-sea hydrothermal vent field along the Eastern Lau Spreading Center and Valu Fa Ridge. Cells of strain LG1T were motile rods, occurring singly or in pairs, 0.6μm in width and 1.2μm in length. The strain LG1T grew between 40 and 70°C (optimum 50–55°C), at a pH between 5 and 8 (optimum pH 6.5) and with 7.5–50gL−1 NaCl (optimum 30gL−1). Sulfur, cystine and thiosulfate were reduced to sulfide, and cell yield was improved in the presence of cystine. Strain LG1T was an organotroph able to use a variety of organic compounds. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequence comparisons indicated that strain LG1T was affiliated to the genus Marinitoga within the order Petrotogales. It shared 95.34–96.31% 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity with strains of other Marinitoga species, and is most closely related to Marinitoga okinawensis. Genome analysis revealed the presence of a prophage sharing high sequence homology with the viruses MPV1, MCV1 and MCV2 hosted by Marinitoga strains.

We have found that activated Akt enhances rRNA synthesis through the phosphorylation of casein kinase IIα (CK2α) on a threonine residue near its N terminus. CK2 in turn phosphorylates TIF-IA, thereby increasing rDNA transcription. Activated Akt also stabilizes TIF-IA, induces its translocation to the nucleolus, and enhances its interaction with Pol I. Treatment with AZD8055, an inhibitor of both Akt and mammalian target of rapamycin phosphorylation, but not with rapamycin, disrupts Akt-mediated TIF-IA stability, translocation, and activity. These data support a model in which activated Akt enhances rRNA synthesis both by preventing TIF-IA degradation and phosphorylating CK2α, which in turn phosphorylates TIF-IA. This model provides an explanation for the ability of activated Akt to promote cell proliferation and, potentially, transformation.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA-directed RNA polymerase 3acell nucleolus 3acell proliferation 3amammals 3amodels 3anon-specific serine/threonine protein kinase 3aphosphorylation 3aribosomal DNA 3aribosomal RNA 3athreonine 0aPKB/Akt 0aacute myelogenous leukemia1 aMitchell, Beverly S.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2013 Dec. 17, v. 110, no. 51 p.20681-20686dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.13130971103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02526naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002200186245007100208300002000279506007600299520096200375592002801337506003701365650001101402650001701413650002001430650001401450650000901464650001201473650001101485650001301496650001401509653003301523653002901556653002201585653002201607700002401629700002401653700002101677700002401698700002201722700002401744773017601768856007901944852000902023655001202032IND60178484920221207114829.0150604e20131217xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017848492DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.13133401102doi7 aPMC38707142pmcid7 a242978762pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPalyanov, Yuri N.10aMantle–slab interaction and redox mechanism of diamond formation  ap. 20408-20413.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSubduction tectonics imposes an important role in the evolution of the interior of the Earth and its global carbon cycle; however, the mechanism of the mantle–slab interaction remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate the results of high-pressure redox-gradient experiments on the interactions between Mg-Ca-carbonate and metallic iron, modeling the processes at the mantle–slab boundary; thereby, we present mechanisms of diamond formation both ahead of and behind the redox front. It is determined that, at oxidized conditions, a low-temperature Ca-rich carbonate melt is generated. This melt acts as both the carbon source and crystallization medium for diamond, whereas at reduced conditions, diamond crystallizes only from the Fe-C melt. The redox mechanism revealed in this study is used to explain the contrasting heterogeneity of natural diamonds, as seen in the composition of inclusions, carbon isotopic composition, and nitrogen impurity content.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acarbon 3acarbon cycle 3acrystallization 3aevolution 3airon 3amelting 3amodels 3anitrogen 3atectonics 0acarbonate–iron interaction 0ahigh-pressure experiment 0amantle mineralogy 0adeep carbon cycle1 aBataleva, Yuliya V.1 aSokol, Alexander G.1 aBorzdov, Yuri M.1 aKupriyanov, Igor N.1 aReutsky, Vadim N.1 aSobolev, Nikolai V.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2013 Dec. 17, v. 110, no. 51 p.20408-20413dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.13133401103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03302naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100008900148245014700237506011700384506007600501520149500577592002802072506003702100650002302137650001402160650002502174650002002199650002002219650001702239650002102256650002402277650001102301653002202312653001702334653003402351653002702385653001902412700001902431700007002450700005802520700003502578773013902613856008302752852000902835655001202844IND60764030120221207110139.0220706e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076403012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jaim.2021.09.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRanaweera, Boyagoda Vidanelage Loshini Ravima1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9631-875510aIncreased expression of co-stimulatory molecules and enhancement of the IgG response in rats orally administered with a polyherbal formulation  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aLink Samahan® (LS) is a standardized modern formulation of a polyherbal preparation used in the indigenous system of medicine in Sri Lanka. Evaluation of the immunostimulatory activity of LS and the molecular mechanisms that modulate the humoral immune response. Immunostimulatory activity of LS was tested in rats following oral administration on days 1-5 and 15-19 and immunization with bovine serum albumin (BSA) on day 1 and 15. Anti-BSA IgM and IgG response in rats treated with LS, water and sugar (as controls) were compared on days 0-35, using ELISA. The expression of co-stimulatory molecules on lymphocytes was assessed on days 0-8 and days 14-22 using RT-qPCR. IgM and IgG levels of LS-treated rats were increased significantly by day 7 and 21 respectively compared to controls (p < 0.05).

Bacteriophages MS2 and ΦX174 were used as model viruses, and kaolinite (ΚGa-1b) and montmorillonite (STx-1b) as model clay colloids. A steady flow rate of Q=1.5mL/min was applied in both vertical up (VU) and vertical down (VD) flow directions. In the presence of KGa-1b, estimated mass recovery values for both viruses were higher for VD than VU flow direction, while in the presence of STx-1b the opposite was observed. However, for all cases examined, the produced mass of viruses attached onto suspended clay particles were higher for VD than VU flow direction, suggesting that the flow direction significantly influences virus attachment onto clays, as well as packed column retention of viruses attached onto suspended clays. KGa-1b hindered the transport of ΦX174 under VD flow, while STx-1b facilitated the transport of ΦX174 under both VU and VD flow directions. Moreover, KGa-1b and STx-1b facilitated the transport of MS2 in most of the cases examined except of the case where KGa-1b was present under VD flow. Also, the experimental data were used for the estimation of virus surface-coverages and virus surface concentrations generated by virus diffusion-limited attachment, as well as virus attachment due to sedimentation. Both sedimentation and diffusion limited virus attachment were higher for VD than VU flow, except the case of MS2 and STx-1b cotransport. The diffusion-limited attachment was higher for MS2 than ΦΧ174 for all cases examined.  aPublisher supplied data 3abacteriophages 3aclay 3acolloids 3aglass 3agravity 3akaolinite 3amontmorillonite 3asteady flow 0aGravity effects 0aΦX174 0aMS2 0aClay minerals 0aKGa-1b 0aSTx-1b 0aViruses 0aColloids 0aCotransport 0aPorous media1 aChrysikopoulos, Constantinos V.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4722-86970 tScience of the total environment.g2016 Mar. 01, v. 545-546 p.210-218dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2015.12.0913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02975naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245007600170500002200246520143100268592002801699650001601727650002501743650002101768650002501789650001601814650001901830650001201849650001101861650002001872650002201892650001401914650001501928650001401943653002201957653002601979653000702005653000702012653000902019653000802028653000802036653000902044653000702053653000702060653000702067653000802074653000802082700003202090700002702122700001702149700006402166773010502230856005302335852000902388655001202397IND60795495720221123012314.0221004e20220928xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079549572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.1033532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLima, Anugata10aSpermidine alleviates heat shock and promotes the growth of Bombyx mori  aPre-press version  aSilkworms have limited ability to regulate their body temperature upon exposure to varying atmospheric temperatures. Environmental changes, such as global warming, adversely affect silkworm viability. Spermidine, a polyamine, protects various organisms against heat stress. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of spermidine on the thermotolerance of Bombyx mori larvae. 5th instar Bombyx mori larvae were divided into the control and spermidine groups and reared at 28 ± 1 °C and 80%–85% relative humidity. To induce heat stress, the larvae were exposed to various temperatures 32 °C, 36 °C, and 40 °C for 1 h on day 5 and subsequently allowed to recover at 28 ± 1 °C. Growth characteristics were evaluated by examining larval viability and quantifying proteins and carbohydrates. The thermotolerance of the spermidine group was higher than that of the control group at 40 °C heat stress conditions. The spermidine feeding increased the protein content and reduced the carbohydrate content significantly under heat stress condition. For the first time, this study demonstrated that spermidine alleviated thermal stress by enhancing the nutritional indices and antioxidant potential of the Bombyx mori larvae. A significant increase in economic properties was observed in spermidine fed groups. Thus, foliar feeding of spermidine to B. mori larvae markedly improved silkworm thermotolerance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBombyx mori 3aantioxidant activity 3abody temperature 3acarbohydrate content 3aheat stress 3aheat tolerance 3ainstars 3alarvae 3aprotein content 3arelative humidity 3asilkworms 3aspermidine 3aviability 0aNutrition indices 0aAntioxidant potential 0aAD 0aCI 0aDPPH 0aECD 0aECI 0aFRAP 0aGR 0aHS 0aNI 0aSOD 0aSpd1 aLakshmi Didugu, Brinda Goda1 aChunduri, Alekhya Rani1 aRajan, Resma1 aMamillapalli, Anitha1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3990-29980 tJournal of thermal biology.g2022 Sept. 28,  p.103353-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12493x0306-45657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.103353  aDNAL 7aarticle01859naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245013100160300001800291520064200309592002800951650001800979650003400997650001401031650000901045650001301054650001401067650002101081650001101102650002001113650001301133650001401146650002201160700002501182700001601207700002301223773013101246856007501377852000901452655001201461IND60539151620170620000000.0160815e20140521xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053915162DNAL7 a10.1021/ja50287162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNajafpour, M.

Supported on montmorillonite clay and using Ce(IV) as a chemical oxidant, 1 has been reported to be one of the best Mn-based molecular catalysts toward water oxidation. By X-ray absorption spectroscopy and kinetic analysis of the oxygen evolution reaction, we show that [(OH₂)(terpy)Mn(μ-O)₂Mn(terpy)(OH₂)]³⁺ is transformed into layered type Mn-oxide particles which are the actual water oxidation catalyst.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCyanobacteria 3aX-ray absorption spectroscopy 3acatalysts 3aclay 3akinetics 3amanganese 3amanganese oxides 3amodels 3amontmorillonite 3aoxidants 3aoxidation 3aoxygen production1 aMoghaddam, Atefeh N.1 aDau, Holger1 aZaharieva, Ivelina0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2014 May 21, v. 136, no. 20 p.7245-7248dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fja50287163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02998naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002500152245015600177300001600333520163800349592002801987650000802015650001202023650001502035650001502050650001002065650001202075650002202087650002502109653002902134653002902163653002602192653002402218653001502242653002002257700001702277700001502294700001502309700001702324700001702341773009802358856008702456852000902543655001202552IND60613421220221119142105.0201202e20181115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061342122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.08.0462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGhaderi Masouleh, M.10aFlow and thermal field effects on cycle-to-cycle variation of combustion: scale-resolving simulation in a spark ignited simplified engine configuration  ap. 486-505.  aPremixed, spark ignited combustion of lean methane at fuel to air equivalence ratio of 0.58 is numerically investigated in a piston-cylinder assembly. The simplified numerical configuration is tailored to emulate the intake, compression and spark ignition processes in engines. Large-eddy simulation is employed in the core flow along with a zonal hybrid wall treatment in near-wall regions. The G-equation level-set method is used to simulate flame propagation with a detailed chemistry based laminar flame speed correlation developed herein. The main numerical findings of this paper are as follows: (1) Despite the geometrical simplicity, the present set-up is shown to exhibit relatively large cycle-to-cycle variation for the three investigated cycles. (2) The local thermodynamics and fluid dynamic conditions around the spark close to the ignition location initiate the first discrepancies between the cycles. (3) These early variations are then amplified due to the subsequent differences in the early growth of flame area. (4) The cycle-to-cycle variation in the present set-up is shown to be largely a consequence of the local flow fluctuations close to the spark position and timing, while the results indicated a less dominating role of thermal stratification on cycle-to-cycle variation. (5) The asymmetric combustion behavior was explained to be a combined effect of burning rate and convection velocity, while convection velocity proved to be the major contributor. (6) Finally, a numerical test in the present model setup indicated large spark kernels being less prone to cycle-to-cycle variations than small kernels.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aburning 3acombustion 3aconvection 3afuels 3amethane 3asimulation models 3atemperature profiles 0aCycle-to-cycle variation 0aSpark-ignited gas engine 0aLarge-eddy simulation 0aLaminar flame speed 0aG-equation 0aLean combustion1 aKeskinen, K.1 aKaario, O.1 aKahila, H.1 aWright, Y.M.1 aVuorinen, V.0 tApplied energy.g2018 Nov. 15, v. 230 p.486-505dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.08.0463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02817naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002800150245012700178300001600305520139400321592002801715653002001743653002301763653003301786653002901819653001901848653001601867653001201883653002101895653002501916653002701941653001901968653001801987700003002005700004102035700003102076700003502107700003502142773012502177856008402302852000902386655001202395IND60554739720221120103157.0161024e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055473972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.labcli.2014.09.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBequer Mendoza, Leticia10aEstudio bioquímico en sangre del cordón umbilical de recién nacidos teniendo en cuenta edad gestacional y peso al nacer  ap. 111-118.  aThe biochemical study of umbilical cord blood is not common practice in most neonatal services. However, the unique features of this matrix could be used to benefit scientific research and diagnosis of neonatal diseases. The objective of this research is to study the possible influence of fetal development in the composition of indicators of renal and lipid profile in cord blood of newborns based on gestational age and birth weight, and other anthropometric and obstetric factors interest.Strict inclusion and exclusion criteria established 2 study groups: 80 healthy newborns as control group, and 60 neonates weighing less than 2,500g, classified by gestational age as study group. Parameters of renal function (urea and creatinine) and lipid (cholesterol, triglycerides and VLDL) were quantified in cord blood.Renal and lipid profile, except urea, showed a difference between low birth weight newborns and healthy infants as the control group, either related to gestational age, to underweight or both. There was significant negative correlation of creatinine and cholesterol with gestational age and birth weight, while the other lipid parameters only negatively correlated with weight.This study provides a better understanding of the behavior of these clinical chemistry parameters in cord blood and in the future this understanding may enhance the newborńs health and wellness.  aPublisher supplied data 0aRecién nacidos 0aBajo peso al nacer 0aSangre del cordón umbilical 0aParámetros bioquímicos 0aFunción renal 0aLipidograma 0aNewborn 0aLow birth weight 0aUmbilical cord blood 0aBiochemical parameters 0aRenal function 0aLipid profile1 aGómez Hernández, Tahiry1 aPérez de Alejo Rodríguez, Lutgarda1 aMolina Hernández, Orlando1 aPeláez Pairol, María Antonia1 aFerrer i Mallol, Maria Teresa,0 tRevista del Laboratorio Clinico.g2014 July,  Sept., v. 7 p.111-118dElsevier EspanaaAEBM, AEFA y SEQCx1888-40087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.labcli.2014.09.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03263naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002700113040001800140100002100158245013100179300001600310520139900326592002801725650001801753650001901771650001701790650002101807650001301828650001101841650001901852650001101871650001101882650001501893650001301908650001001921650001201931650001601943650001301959650002201972650002301994650002002017650002902037650000902066650001202075650002002087650001602107650002202123650001902145650002202164650002202186651001602208700001602224700003002240700001902270700001702289700002102306700002102327700001902348700002602367700001802393700002002411773009702431856004002528852000902568655001202577IND50075002720221116235437.0140410e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007500272DNAL7 a246020892pmid7 a10.1111/nph.127412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTreydte, Kerstin10aSeasonal transfer of oxygen isotopes from precipitation and soil to the tree ring: source water versus needle water enrichment  ap. 772-783.  aFor accurate interpretation of oxygen isotopes in tree rings (δ¹⁸O), it is necessary to disentangle the mechanisms underlying the variations in the tree's internal water cycle and to understand the transfer of source versus leaf water δ¹⁸O to phloem sugars and stem wood. We studied the seasonal transfer of oxygen isotopes from precipitation and soil water through the xylem, needles and phloem to the tree rings of Larix decidua at two alpine sites in the Lötschental (Switzerland). Weekly resolved δ¹⁸O records of precipitation, soil water, xylem and needle water, phloem organic matter and tree rings were developed. Week‐to‐week variations in needle‐water ¹⁸O enrichment were strongly controlled by weather conditions during the growing season. These short‐term variations were, however, not significantly fingerprinted in tree‐ring δ¹⁸O. Instead, seasonal trends in tree‐ring δ¹⁸O predominantly mirrored trends in the source water, including recent precipitation and soil water pools. Modelling results support these findings: seasonal tree‐ring δ¹⁸O variations are captured best when the week‐to‐week variations of the leaf water signal are suppressed. Our results suggest that climate signals in tree‐ring δ¹⁸O variations should be strongest at temperate sites with humid conditions and precipitation maxima during the growing season.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLarix decidua 3agrowing season 3agrowth rings 3ahydrologic cycle 3aisotopes 3aleaves 3aorganic matter 3aoxygen 3aphloem 3asoil water 3astemwood 3atrees 3aweather 2aCalibration 2aHumidity 2aLarixxmetabolism 2aModels, Biological 2aOxygen Isotopes 2aPlant Leavesxmetabolism 2aRain 2aSeasons 2aSoilxchemistry 2aTemperature 2aTreesxmetabolism 2aVapor Pressure 2aWaterxmetabolism 2aXylemxmetabolism 0aSwitzerland1 aBoda, Sonja1 aGraf Pannatier, Elisabeth1 aFonti, Patrick1 aFrank, David1 aUllrich, Bastian1 aSaurer, Matthias1 aSiegwolf, Rolf1 aBattipaglia, Giovanna1 aWerner, Willy1 aGessler, Arthur0 tnew phytologist.g2014 May, v. 202, no. 3 p.772-783dWilliam Wesley and Sonx0028-646X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/nph.12741  aDNAL 7aarticle02470naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002300152245015500175500002200330520127500352592002801627650002001655650001601675650001801691650001601709650001301725650002001738650001601758651001201774653001501786653001101801653000901812653001201821653001201833653001501845653002001860773010501880856005301985961001302038852000902051655001202060IND60795495920221123011952.0221004e20220928xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079549592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.1033562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSrygley, Robert B.10aTemperature effects on mormon cricket Anabrus simplex embryo development, hatching and nymphal growth: Thermal performance curves change with ontogeny  aPre-press version  aThermal performance curves for development are an essential tool for population modeling and pest management. More broadly, they characterize how selection on thermal limits or maximum rates change with life stage. The effects of temperature on development of Mormon cricket embryos, and hatching and development of nymphs were measured on a population from the Bighorn Mountains of Wyoming and modeled with four non-linear equations. Taylor's Gaussian curve characterized embryonic development, which was most rapid at 26.9 °C. However, half-grown embryos aestivated at high temperatures, resulting in a significant shift in the optimum temperature to complete embryonic development to 24.1 °C and a reduction in the breadth of the performance curve (thermal breadth). Fully grown embryos hatched fastest at relatively low temperatures (21.8 °C), whereas nymphal development was maximized at relatively high temperatures (35.7 °C). Thermal breadths for nymphal hatching and development were also significantly broader than that for embryonic development. Differences in optimum temperature and thermal breadth of each life stage should be taken into consideration in population modeling, comparisons among populations, and epigenetic studies of acclimation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnabrus simplex 3aacclimation 3aembryogenesis 3aepigenetics 3aontogeny 3apest management 3atemperature 3aWyoming 0aDemography 0aGrowth 0aHeat 0aKatydid 0aOptimum 0aPopulation 0aThermal breadth0 tJournal of thermal biology.g2022 Sept. 28,  p.103356-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12493x0306-45657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.103356  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02777naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002300145245008400168300001400252520135500266592002801621650001901649650001901668650001801687650001501705650001501720650001501735650001701750650001501767650002301782650002401805650001201829650002701841650001901868650001601887650001401903650000901917650001101926650001101937653001101948653001801959653002101977653001501998653001302013653002702026700001902053773009902072856007902171852000902250655001202259IND60515068920221120235446.0160311e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051506892DNAL7 a10.1556/018.67.2016.1.42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEl Shora, Hamed M.10aPlant growth regulators induced urease activity in Cucurbita pepo L. cotyledons  ap. 53-63.  aThis study is aimed to investigate the activity of urease (EC 3.5.1.5, urea amidohydrolase) that catalyzes the hydrolysis of urea in 5-day-old Cucurbita pepo cotyledons subjected to various concentrations of different growth regulators. The treatment of C. pepo cotyledons with different concentrations (100–600 μmol) of different auxins [indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), indole butyric acid (IBA), indole propionic acid (IPA) and naphthalene acetic acid (NAA)]; or with different concentrations (100–300 μmol) of different cytokinins [kinetin, zeatin and benzyladenine (6-BA)] resulted in a significant increase of urease activity, compared to control. The optimal effects were recorded for each of 500 μmol of IAA and 300 μmol of zeatin treatments. A gradual increase in urease activity was detected in cotyledons treated with various concentrations (0.2–1.0 mM) of 28-homobrassinolide (HBL), in relative to control. A substantial increase in urease activity was observed in cotyledons subjected to different concentrations of triazole (10–60 mg L –¹), containing either triadimefon (TDM) or hexaconazole (HEX), compared to control. The combination of 300 μmol zeatin with any of protein inhibitors, namely 5-fluorouridine (FUrd), cordycepin and α-amanitin, resulted in the alleviation of their inhibitory effect on the urease activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCucurbita pepo 3aalpha-amanitin 3abenzyladenine 3acordycepin 3acotyledons 3acytokinins 3ahexaconazole 3ahydrolysis 3aindole acetic acid 3aindole butyric acid 3akinetin 3anaphthaleneacetic acid 3apropionic acid 3atriadimefon 3atriazoles 3aurea 3aurease 3azeatin 0aAuxins 0abenzyladenine 0abrassinosteroids 0acordycepin 0atriazole 0aurease activity-zeatin1 aAli, Awatif S.0 tActa biologica Hungarica.g2016 Mar., v. 67, no. 1 p.53-63dAkadémiai Kiadóx1588-256X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1556/018.67.2016.1.43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02744naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245006500166300001400231520148500245592002801730650001201758650003401770650001801804650001601822650002801838650001301866650001701879650001701896650002101913650001301934650000901947650002801956650000901984700002501993700001602018700003102034700002102065773010802086856008402194990002302278852000902301655001202310IND60097851320221123033653.0141104e20120405xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009785132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ejphar.2012.01.0382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFusi, Fabio10aMechanism of osthole inhibition of vascular Caᵥ1.2 current  ap. 22-27.  aOsthole is a coumarin extracted from Cnidium monnieri (L.) Cusson. The medicinal plant is widely used in Vietnamese as well as Chinese traditional medicine as a vasodilating and antihypertensive agent. Here we have tested the proposition that the block of Caᵥ1.2 channels is mainly responsible for its vascular activity. An in-depth analysis of the effect of osthole on Caᵥ1.2 current (ICₐ₁.₂) was performed in rat tail artery myocytes using the whole-cell patch-clamp method. Osthole decreased ICₐ₁.₂ in a concentration- and voltage-dependent manner. At holding potentials of −50 and −80mV, the pIC₅₀ values were 4.78±0.07 and 4.36±0.08, respectively; the latter corresponded to the drug apparent dissociation constant for resting channels, KR, of 47.8μM. Osthole speeded up the inactivation kinetics of ICₐ₁.₂ and shifted the voltage dependence of the inactivation curve to more negative potentials in a concentration-dependent manner, with an apparent dissociation constant for inactivated channels (KI) of 6.88μM. Block of ICₐ₁.₂ was frequency-dependent and the rate of recovery from inactivation was slowed down. In conclusion, osthole is a vascular Caᵥ1.2 channel antagonist stabilizing the channel in its inactivated state. This mechanism may account for the systolic blood pressure reduction induced by the drug in animal models of hypertension and points to osthole as a lead for the development of novel antihypertensive agents.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCnidium 3aOriental traditional medicine 3aanimal models 3aantagonists 3aantihypertensive agents 3acoumarin 3adissociation 3ahypertension 3amedicinal plants 3amyocytes 3arats 3asystolic blood pressure 3atail1 aSgaragli, Giampietro1 aHa, Le Minh1 aNguyễn, Mạnh Cường,1 aSaponara, Simona0 tEuropean journal of pharmacology.g2012 Apr. 5, v. 680, no. 1-3 p.22-27dElsevier B.V.x0014-29997nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejphar.2012.01.0383Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02920naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245010900166300001800275520136800293592002801661596011101689650003401800650001501834650002501849650001901874650002501893650002101918650002201939650001001961650001201971650001601983650001701999650002602016650002102042650001502063650001902078650000802097700001702105700001802122700001602140700001702156700001302173700002502186773012002211856008602331852000902417655001202426IND60624933420221118212646.0191017e20180515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062493342DNAL7 a10.1093/bioinformatics/btx8342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Mengci10apolyPK: an R package for pharmacokinetic analysis of multi-component drugs using a metabolomics approach  ap. 1792-1794.  aPharmacokinetics (PK) is a long-standing bottleneck for botanical drug and traditional medicine research. By using an integrated phytochemical and metabolomics approach coupled with multivariate statistical analysis, we propose a new strategy, Poly-PK, to simultaneously monitor the performance of drug constituents and endogenous metabolites, taking into account both the diversity of the drug’s chemical composition and its complex effects on the mammalian metabolic pathways. Poly-PK is independent of specific measurement platforms and has been successfully applied in the PK studies of Puerh tea, a traditional Chinese medicine Huangqi decoction and many other multi-component drugs. Here, we introduce an R package, polyPK, the first and only automation of the data analysis pipeline of Poly-PK strategy. polyPK provides 10 functions for data pre-processing, differential compound identification and grouping, traditional PK parameters calculation, multivariate statistical analysis, correlations, cluster analyses and resulting visualization. It may serve a wide range of users, including pharmacologists, biologists and doctors, in understanding the metabolic fate of multi-component drugs. polyPK package is freely available from the R archive CRAN (https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=polyPK).

Iron oxides are earth-abundant and nontoxic, with narrow bandgaps and suitable valence band positions for the visible-light-driven water oxidation reaction; however, an energy limitation for hydrogen generation is encountered due to the improper conduction band level. Herein, we demonstrated that this limitation could be overcome by the incorporation of small amounts of GO in the metal–organic framework (MOF)-templated synthesis of iron oxide, affording a uniform and highly ordered ferrite octahedral nanostructure embedded on graphene nanosheets. Such structural superiorities would result in a highly synergistic effect between Fe₂O₃ and reduced graphene oxide (rGO), affording an elevated flat band potential and a promoted photogenerated charge carrier separation and transportation. As a consequence, the resulting maghemite–carbonaceous composite exhibited a high photocatalytic H₂ evolution rate of 318.0 μmol h⁻¹ g⁻¹ in the absence of noble metal cocatalysts and external bias. This work provides for the first time an ideal pathway for the utilization of Fe₂O₃ as the dominant component of a nanocomposite in efficient photocatalytic H₂ production, as well as the prospect of developing highly active photocatalysts for overall water splitting. In addition, different phases of iron oxide, including maghemite (γ-Fe₂O₃), hematite (α-Fe₂O₃) and magnetite (Fe₃O₄), and their carbonaceous composites can be obtained through the cautiously selected thermolysis of Fe-MOF and MOF/GO composites. The maghemite phase could be maintained with high saturation magnetization values under a large temperature gradient, implying a great potential for applications in magnetism and biomedicine-related research fields.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoordination polymers 3aenergy 3aferrimagnetic materials 3agraphene 3agraphene oxide 3ahematite 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen production 3amaghemite 3amagnetism 3amagnetite 3ananocomposites 3ananosheets 3aoxidation 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3athermal degradation1 aChen, Junying1 aShen, Kui1 aLi, Yingwei0 tJournal of materials chemistry.g2018 Feb. 20, v. 6, no. 8 p.3571-3582dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ta10284d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02876naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002400189245015000213300001800363506007600381520108100457592002801538506003701566650000801603650003101611650001301642650001501655650002301670650001901693650002101712650001201733650001401745650001301759650002101772650001101793650002201804650002801826650001301854653000801867653000801875653000801883653001401891653000901905653001101914653003101925653003101956700001401987700002202001700002502023700002402048773012302072856008202195852000902277655001202286IND60533038320221207132806.0160728e20140808xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053303832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2014.06.1322doi7 aPMC42166942pmcid7 a249973372pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTiwari, Kirti Kumar10aDifferential concentration-specific effects of caffeine on cell viability, oxidative stress, and cell cycle in pulmonary oxygen toxicity in vitro  ap. 1345-1350.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCaffeine is used to prevent bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in premature neonates. Hyperoxia contributes to the development of BPD, inhibits cell proliferation and decreases cell survival. The mechanisms responsible for the protective effect of caffeine in pulmonary oxygen toxicity remain largely unknown. A549 and MLE 12 pulmonary epithelial cells were exposed to hyperoxia or maintained in room air, in the presence of different concentrations (0, 0.05, 0.1 and 1mM) of caffeine. Caffeine had a differential concentration-specific effect on cell cycle progression, oxidative stress and viability, with 1mM concentration being deleterious and 0.05mM being protective. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation during hyperoxia was modulated by caffeine in a similar concentration-specific manner. Caffeine at 1mM, but not at the 0.05mM concentration decreased the G2 arrest in these cells. Taken together this study shows the novel funding that caffeine has a concentration-specific effect on cell cycle regulation, ROS generation, and cell survival in hyperoxic conditions.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aair 3abronchopulmonary dysplasia 3acaffeine 3acell cycle 3acell proliferation 3acell viability 3aepithelial cells 3afunding 3ahyperoxia 3aneonates 3aoxidative stress 3aoxygen 3aprotective effect 3areactive oxygen species 3atoxicity 0aBPD 0aRDS 0aROS 0aHyperoxia 0aA549 0aMLE 12 0aBronchopulmonary dysplasia 0aPulmonary epithelial cells1 aChu, Chun1 aCouroucli, Xanthi1 aMoorthy, Bhagavatula1 aLingappan, Krithika0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2014 Aug. 08, v. 450 p.1345-1350dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2014.06.1323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03683naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100005600140245017800196500002000374520217200394592002802566596008902594596005502683650002202738650002102760650001002781650002202791650002202813650001402835650001102849650001502860650002002875650002102895650001602916650001602932700001402948700001602962700005702978773014303035856007403178852000903252655001203261IND60744203720221120172111.0210710e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074420372DNAL7 a10.1111/jfpp.156662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Wenjun1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8575-600710aDevelopment of active poly(butylene adipate‐co‐terephthalate) films incorporated with sodium benzoate and its application in white mushroom (Agaricus bisporus) packaging  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe poly(butylene adipate‐co‐terephthalate) (PBAT) active films added with different concentrations (0%, 1%, 3%, 5%) of sodium benzoate (SB) were developed and their properties were evaluated. The FTIR analysis showed the interaction between PBAT and SB. The scanning electron microscope result exhibited that SB was uniformly dispersed in the PBAT matrix and tended to aggregate with its increasing content. The crystallinity of PBAT films increased for the incorporation of SB and it reached maximum for the film containing 3% SB. The color difference among all films was small, but the transparence decreased as SB increased. As the content of SB increased, the tensile strength (TS) and elongation at break (EAB) of films both increased first and then decreased, the film added with 1% SB possessed the maximum of TS and EAB. The gas barrier performance (oxygen and water vapor) of the films reduced with the increasing content of SB. Moreover, the results of the preservation of white mushrooms packaged by these films showed that the PBAT films added with SB could retard the browning, weight loss, soften, and the increase of microbiology of white mushrooms during storage. And the quality maintenance effect increased with the increasing content of SB. The results indicated that the active PBAT films added with SB were the potential to be used for food preservation. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Poly(butylene adipate‐co‐terephthalate) (PBAT) as one of biodegradable materials is considered a promising packaging material due to its biodegradability, high‐temperature resistance, and high elongation at break. In this study, sodium benzoate acted as both nucleating agent and active agent was blended with PBAT to develop biodegradable active film. It evidenced that PBAT films containing different concentrations of SB were beneficial for the preservation of white mushrooms, which could delay the browning, weight loss, soften, and microbe growth of white mushrooms for 15 days. It also indicated that the PBAT films incorporated with SB could be potential to be used as antimicrobial active packaging for food preservation to extend its shelf life.  aPublisher supplied data  a2018YFD0400701cMinistry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China  aA2‐2006‐00‐200361cShanghai Ocean University 3aAgaricus bisporus 3abiodegradability 3acolor 3acrystal structure 3afood preservation 3amushrooms 3aoxygen 3ashelf life 3asodium benzoate 3atensile strength 3awater vapor 3aweight loss1 aWang, Lei1 aYang, Fuxin1 aChen, Chenwei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3716-19460 tJournal of food processing and preservation.g2021 July, v. 45, no. 7 p.e15666-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl45214x0145-88927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfpp.156663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02974naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100001400186245008900200300002000289506007600309520152400385592002801909506003701937650001601974650002201990650002902012650000902041650002102050650001402071650001102085650001202096650000902108650001602117653002802133653003002161653002702191653002002218700002602238773017602264856007902440852000902519655001202528IND60173570920221207124603.0150603e20121218xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017357092DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.12186681092doi7 aPMC35290152pmcid7 a231978272pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Hao10aCentromere retention and loss during the descent of maize from a tetraploid ancestor  ap. 21004-21009.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAlthough centromere function is highly conserved in eukaryotes, centromere sequences are highly variable. Only a few centromeres have been sequenced in higher eukaryotes because of their repetitive nature, thus hindering study of their structure and evolution. Conserved single-copy sequences in pericentromeres (CSCPs) of sorghum and maize were found to be diagnostic characteristics of adjacent centromeres. By analyzing comparative map data and CSCP sequences of sorghum, maize, and rice, the major evolutionary events related to centromere dynamics were discovered for the maize lineage after its divergence from a common ancestor with sorghum. (i) Remnants of ancient CSCP regions were found for the 10 lost ancestral centromeres, indicating that two ancient homeologous chromosome pairs did not contribute any centromeres to the current maize genome, whereas two other pairs contributed both of their centromeres. (ii) Five cases of long-distance, intrachromosome movement of CSCPs were detected in the retained centromeres, with inversion the major process involved.

However, mechanisms responsible for diabetic neuropathic pain are still unclear. Experimental evidence has shown that the galanin and its receptor are involved in pain sensitization. The objective of the present study was to investigate the role of galanin and its receptor antagonist or agonist on neuropathic pain in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. The expression of galanin, galanin receptors 1 and 2 in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) and spinal dorsal horn (SDH) in diabetic rats were detected by Western blot assay. The effects of galanin, galanin receptor antagonist M35, galanin receptor 1 agonist M617, and galanin receptor 2 agonist AR-M1896 on neuropathic pain were evaluated by mechanical stimuli. The results showed that (1) the diabetic rats showed a significant mechanical hyperalgesia between 4 and 12weeks; (2) galanin receptor 1 expression decreased in SDH in diabetic rats; (3) galanin receptor 2 expression decreased in DRG and SDH in diabetic rats; (4) intrathecal administration of exogenous galanin attenuated diabetic neuropathic pain, this effect could be blocked by pre-treatment with galanin receptor antagonist M35; and (5) intrathecal administration of galanin receptor 1 agonist M617, but not galanin receptor 2 agonist AR-M1896, attenuated diabetic neuropathic pain. These results imply that galanin acts through receptor 1, but not galanin receptor 2, to exert analgesic effect in diabetic neuropathic pain and is one of the potential therapeutic targets on diabetic neuropathic pain sensitization.  aPublisher supplied data 3arats 3apain 3aantagonists 3aganglia 3aWestern blotting 3adiabetic neuropathy 3apretreatment 3areceptors 3aagonists 3aanalgesic effect 2aAnimals 2aDiabetes Mellitus, Experimentalxcomplicationsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aDiabetic Neuropathiesxdrug therapyxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aDisease Models, Animal 2aGalaninxgeneticsxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aGanglia, Spinalxmetabolism 2aHyperalgesiaxdrug therapyxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMale 2aPeptide Fragmentsxpharmacology 2aPosterior Horn Cellsxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aRats 2aRats, Wistar 2aReceptor, Galanin, Type 1xgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aReceptor, Galanin, Type 2xgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSpinal Cordxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aStreptozocinxpharmacology 0adiabetes1 aLiu, Zhen1 aLiu, Huaxiang1 aYang, Xiangdong1 aLi, Zhenzhong0 tEuropean journal of pharmacology.g2012 Apr. 5, v. 680, no. 1-3 p.28-33dElsevier B.V.x0014-29997nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejphar.2012.01.0113Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02632naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245011900171520115800290592002801448650001101476650001101487650002201498650001201520650001101532651001001543653003001553653001901583653002301602653002101625653001801646653000701664653000701671653000801678653000801686653000801694653000801702653000801710653000801718653000801726653001001734653000801744653000901752653000901761653000801770653000801778653000901786700001601795700001701811700001901828700001301847773009801860856008701958852000902045655001202054IND60743801420221121053923.0211213e20211001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074380142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.1173382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yanfang12aA market instrument to achieve carbon neutrality: Is China’s energy-consumption permit trading scheme effective?  aThe Chinese government implemented the energy-consumption permit trading scheme (ECPTS) pilot program in 2016, in order to achieve energy saving and carbon reduction. Based on the PSM-DID model, we attempt to test the effects of the ECPTS on energy consumption and energy intensity. With a counterfactual simulation, this paper also evaluates the potential gains and different mechanisms of this policy. The results show that, under the constraints of the established resources and policy efficiency, there is a positive relationship between the ECPTS and low-carbon economic transformation; the implementation of the above policy in the pilot provinces brought about an average energy saving of 43 Mtce during the period of 2016–2019. However, the potential gains of this policy need to be further increased to meet China’s energy control targets. Additionally, a complete mediating effect of the energy structure indicates that the impact of the ECPTS on energy consumption and energy intensity depends significantly on energy structure adjustments. Finally, this paper highlights the key policy implications associated with the empirical results.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3aenergy 3aissues and policy 3amarkets 3amodels 3aChina 0aEnergy-consumption permit 0aTrading scheme 0aEnergy consumption 0aEnergy intensity 0aPSM-DID model 0aQ4 0aL5 0aATT 0aCGE 0aCNY 0aDEA 0aDID 0aDDD 0aECP 0aECPTS 0aETS 0aNDCs 0aNDRC 0aPSM 0atce 0aMtce1 aGuo, Siyuan1 aShi, Xunpeng1 aQian, Xiangyan1 aNie, Rui0 tApplied energy.g2021 Oct. 01, v. 299 p.117338-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.1173383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02206naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245012100155300001600276500001700292520100500309592002801314650001201342650001801354650000901372650000901381650001901390650001401409650001701423650004401440650001301484650001601497700001901513700002201532700001701554700002001571773013401591856007401725852000901799655001201808IND60633658320221118140243.0190321e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063365832DNAL7 a10.1111/jsap.128392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBeever, L.10aSurgical management of chronic otitis secondary to craniomandibular osteopathy in three West Highland white terriers  ap. 254-260.  aCase Reports  aThree West Highland white terriers were presented for investigation of left‐sided para‐aural abscessation. CT revealed chronic otitis media with extensive osseous proliferation surrounding the horizontal and vertical ear canals contiguous with the expanded temporal bone, consistent with a unilateral variant of craniomandibular osteopathy. A left total ear canal ablation with lateral bulla osteotomy was performed in all dogs. An ultrasonic bone curette (Sonopet; Stryker) proved useful when removing the osseous proliferation in two dogs. Histopathological examination of the ear canals was consistent with craniomandibular osteopathy and the treatment led to resolution of the presenting clinical signs in all dogs. To our knowledge, this is the first report of craniomandibular osteopathy engulfing the external ear canal, presumably leading to chronic otitis media and para‐aural abscess formation. This is also the first reported use of an ultrasonic bone curette in canine otic surgery.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabscess 3abone diseases 3adogs 3aears 3ahistopathology 3aosteotomy 3aotitis media 3asigns and symptoms (animals and humans) 3aterriers 3aultrasonics1 aSwinbourne, F.1 aPriestnall, S.

The purpose of the study was to determine the occurrence of antimicrobial drug residues in pork products in Madagascar. The occurrence of antimicrobial drug residues in pork meat were investigated by the Premi® test (DSM©) technique. There was a high incidence rate of drug residues, with 360 (37.2 %) meat samples being contaminated. A significant increase was observed between 2010 and 2011, with 32 and 39%, respectively. Pork meat samples are less contaminated by drug residues when animals are slaughtered in urban abattoirs (34.4%) vs in provincial abattoirs (42.2%), suggesting that animals under treatment (or sick) are sold preferentially in local abattoir. Drug residue levels in pork meats purchased in Madagascar appear to be serious public health problem at the moment.  aPublisher supplied data 3apork 3arisk 3aslaughterhouses 3apublic health 3aanimals 3adeveloping countries 3ahuman health 3aantibiotic residues 3aanti-infective agents 2aAnimals 2aAnti-Bacterial Agentsxanalysis 2aDrug Residuesxanalysis 2aFood Contaminationxanalysis 2aMeatxanalysis 2aRisk Factors 2aSwine 3aMadagascar 0aMadagascar 0aantimicrobial agents1 aPognon, Damien1 aRandriamparany, Tantely1 aMing, Jimmy Chane1 aIdoumbin, Jean-Patrick1 aCardinale, Eric1 aPorphyre, Vincent0 tTropical animal health and production.g2014 Jan., v. 46, no. 1 p.49-55dSpringer-Verlagx0049-47477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11250-013-0445-9  aDNAL 7aarticle01691naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245007200165300001400237520061500251592002800866650001500894650001800909650002100927650004400948650001300992650002101005653002301026653002301049653002901072700001501101700001801116773011601134856008201250852000901332655001201341IND60628461320221121231655.0190401e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062846132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bse.2018.12.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWei, Rong-Rui10aHypolipidemic phenanthraquinone derivatives from Heleocharis dulcis  ap. 17-21.  aThree new phenanthraquinones (1–3), together with seven known phenanthraquinone derivatives (4–10) were isolated from Heleocharis dulcis for the first time.

In this paper, the experiment is improved to address shortcomings in previous freeze-thaw vacuum approach for sludge treatment. The spatio-temporal distribution relationship of distance-time-temperature is developed and divided into two stages by numerically fitting the temperature change of freezing tubes in the sludge. It is expected to guide the time control of large-scale frozen sludge in practical engineering applications to achieve optimal dewatering treatment. Furthermore, the performance of dehydration after the model test is evaluated on multi-scale: settlement and mechanical properties (macroscopic perspective), mean particle size (mesoscopic perspective), and SEM microstructure (microscopic perspective). The results reveal that the improved sludge treatment method of alternating freeze-thaw vacuum procedures, using both prefabricated horizontal drains (PHDs) and prefabricated vertical drains (PVDs), substantially benefits the sludge dewatering and reduction. This method results in an unparalleled volume reduction of 63.51% and a water content reduction to 58.54%. Moreover, in-situ vane shearing strength of the sludge obtained from the improved test meets the strength requirement for the landfill final cover soil, demonstrating that the method is superior in improving mechanical properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3adewatering 3afreeze-thaw cycles 3alandfills 3amicrostructure 3aparticle size 3aresearch 3asludge 3asoil 3atemperature 3awater content 0aImproved freeze-thaw vacuum preloading 0aTemperature spatial and temporal distribution characteristics 0aDewatering and reduction 0aIn-situ vane shearing strength1 aWang, Yaoyi1 aZhang, Xudong1 aZhang, Yunda1 aChen, Guang1 aZhang, Xingtao1 aYe, Peng1 aJi, Jiawei0 tEnvironmental research.g2022 Nov., v. 214 p.114161-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12442x0013-93517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2022.1141613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03066naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245015400168300001400322520133600336592002801672650002501700650001901725650001401744650001001758650001101768650001601779650001201795650001101807650001801818650002701836650002301863653002701886653003401913653003401947653003801981653000702019653000902026653001002035653000702045653000802052653000802060653001202068653000802080653001102088653000802099700002402107700001802131700001802149700001702167700001702184700001902201700001802220700002102238773009902259856008502358852000902443655001202452IND60554417920221122052909.0161024e20140215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055441792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jchromb.2013.12.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTillib, S.V.10aSingle-domain antibody-based ligands for immunoaffinity separation of recombinant human lactoferrin from the goat lactoferrin of transgenic goat milk  ap. 48-57.  aSingle-domain antibody generation technology was applied to make new Sepharose-bound ligands for affinity separation of closely related proteins, such as human and goat lactoferrin. We generated recombinant antibodies that can selectively bind/recognize only lactoferrins having amino acid sequences identical to that of human natural lactoferrin (anti-hLF Ab). Selected and purified histidine-tagged single-domain antibodies were used as ligands, and different lactoferrins were used as analytes in the kinetics analysis of lactoferrin binding to captured anti-hLF Abs using the Bio-Rad ProteOn XPR36 protein interaction array system. The data obtained were consistent with a 1:1 binding model with very high affinity, practically equal in the case of hLF and rec-hLF (calculated KD varied from 0.43nM to 3.7nM). Interaction of captured fsdAbs with goat LF was significantly weaker and not detectable under the same analysis conditions. We demonstrated the high efficiency of the recombinant human lactoferrin purification from goat lactoferrin and other proteins using the obtained single domain antibody-based affinity ligands. We believe this approach can be used for the generation of single-domain antibody-based affinity media for the efficient separation/purification of a wide spectrum of other highly homologous proteins.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acid sequences 3achromatography 3agoat milk 3agoats 3ahumans 3alactoferrin 3aligands 3amodels 3anitroprusside 3arecombinant antibodies 3atransgenic animals 0aSingle-domain antibody 0aRecombinant human lactoferrin 0aImmunoaffinity chromatography 0aSeparation of homologous proteins 0aAb 0asdAb 0afsdAb 0aLF 0agLF 0ahLF 0arec-hLF 0aHRP 0aHA-tag 0aPBS1 aPrivezentseva, M.E.1 aIvanova, T.I.1 aVasilev, L.F.1 aEfimov, G.A.1 aGursky, Y.G.1 aGeorgiev, G.P.1 aGoldman, I.L.1 aSadchikova, E.R.0 tJournal of Chromatography B.g2014 Feb. 15, v. 949-950 p.48-57dElsevier B.V.x1570-02327nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jchromb.2013.12.0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02478naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002100145245010700166300001500273520134800288592002801636650002301664650001201687650001401699650001901713650001101732650000701743650001501750650001601765653001201781653001301793653000701806653002301813653001601836700001901852700002101871773010001892856007901992852000902071655001202080IND60515069320221121010002.0160311e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051506932DNAL7 a10.1556/018.67.2016.1.82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAriafar, M.

As the temperature increased at a constant pH level, biofilm formation decreased while as the pH level increased at a constant temperature, biofilm formation increased. Modified Gompertz equation with high adjusted determination coefficient (R ₐdⱼ²) and low mean square error (MSE) values produced reasonable fits for the biofilm formation under all conditions. Parameters of the modified Gompertz equation could be described in terms of temperature and pH by use of a second order polynomial function. In general, as temperature increased maximum biofilm quantity, maximum biofilm formation rate and time of acceleration of biofilm formation decreased; whereas, as pH increased; maximum biofilm quantity, maximum biofilm formation rate and time of acceleration of biofilm formation increased. Two temperature (23 and 26 °C) and pH (5.3 and 6.3) values were used up to 24 h to predict the biofilm formation of S. Virchow. Although the predictions did not perfectly match with the data, reasonable estimates were obtained. In principle, modeling and predicting the biofilm formation of different microorganisms on different surfaces under various conditions could be possible.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalmonella Virchow 3abiofilm 3aequations 3amicroorganisms 3amodels 3apH 3aprediction 3atemperature 0aBiofilm 0amodeling 0apH 0aSalmonella Virchow 0atemperature1 aBuzrul, Sencer1 aAkçelik, Nefise0 tActa biologica Hungarica.g2016 Mar., v. 67, no. 1 p.99-111dAkadémiai Kiadóx1588-256X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1556/018.67.2016.1.83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04165naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005800150245016900208520229800377592002802675650001402703650001702717650001402734650001402748650001402762650002202776650001102798650002402809650001302833650001502846651001302861651001302874653001802887653002402905653002102929653002302950700002002973700005702993700002903050700006403079700005303143700002203196700001903218700001603237700005903253700006703312700002203379700002403401773010403425856008503529852000903614655001203623IND60791504820221119015418.0220921e202211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079150482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2022.1141632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Xueying1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0806-332410aPrenatal exposure to PM2.5 and childhood cognition: Accounting for between-site heterogeneity in a pooled analysis of ECHO cohorts in the Northeastern United States  aEmerging studies have investigated the adverse health effects of PM₂.₅ using data from multiple cohorts, and results often are not generalizable across cohorts. We aimed to assess associations between prenatal PM₂.₅ and childhood cognition in two U.S. cohorts while accounting for between-site heterogeneity. Analyses included 348 mother-child dyads enrolled in the dual site (New York City and Boston) PRogramming of Intergenerational Stress Mechanisms (PRISM) cohort and in the First Thousand Days of Life (FTDL) study (Northern Virginia) participating in the Environmental influences on Child Health Outcomes (ECHO) national consortium. Residential prenatal PM₂.₅ exposure was estimated using a validated satellite-based model and childhood cognition was measured using the NIH Toolbox Cognition Battery at three to eight years of age. We used a log-linear model applied to contingency tables formed by cross-classifying covariates by site to examine between-site heterogeneity using 3ʳᵈ trimester PM₂.₅ exposure, age-corrected cognition scores, and covariates potentially causing heterogeneities. Multivariable linear regression models informed by the combinability analysis were used to estimate the coefficients and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between 3ʳᵈ trimester PM₂.₅ exposure and age-corrected cognition scores (mean = 100, SD = 15). The log-linear model indicated that inter-study associations were similar between PRISM-NYC and FTDL, which were different from those in PRISM-Boston. Accordingly, we combined the data of PRISM-NYC and FTDL cohorts. We observed associations between 3ʳᵈ trimester PM₂.₅ and cognition scores, findings were varying by site, childsex, and test. For example, a 1 μg/m³ increase of 3ʳᵈ trimester PM₂.₅ was associated with −4.35 (95% CI = −8.73, −0.25) mean early childhood cognition scores in females in PRISM-Boston. In the pooled NYC + FTDL site, the association between PM₂.₅ and childhood cognition may be modified by maternal education and urbanicity. We found associations between prenatal PM₂.₅ and impaired childhood cognition. Since multi-site analyses are increasingly conducted, our findings suggest the needed awareness of between-site heterogeneity.  aPublisher supplied data 3abatteries 3achild health 3achildhood 3acognition 3aeducation 3amaternal exposure 3amodels 3aregression analysis 3aresearch 3asatellites 3aNew York 3aVirginia 0aAir pollution 0aChildhood cognition 0aLog-linear model 0aHeterogeneity test1 aLiu, Shelley H.1 aGeron, Mariel1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5617-20101 aMathilda Chiu, Yueh-Hsiu1 aGershon, I.

Here, we report a previously unobserved type of amyloid fibril that tests as cytotoxic: one in which the strands of the contributing β-sheets are out of register. In all amyloid fibrils previously characterized at the molecular level, only in-register β-sheets have been observed, in which each strand makes its full complement of hydrogen bonds with the strands above and below it in the fibril. In out-of-register sheets, strands are sheared relative to one another, leaving dangling hydrogen bonds. Based on this finding, we designed out-of-register β-sheet amyloid mimics, which form both cylindrin-like oligomers and fibrils, and these mimics are cytotoxic. Structural and energetic considerations suggest that out-of-register fibrils can readily convert to toxic cylindrins. We propose that out-of-register β-sheets and their related cylindrins are part of a toxic amyloid pathway, which is distinct from the more energetically favored in-register amyloid pathway.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aamyloid 3acytotoxicity 3ahydrogen bonding 3ascientists 0aX-ray crystallography 0aBAMs1 aZhao, Minglei1 aJiang, Lin1 aCheng, Pin-Nan1 aPark, Jiyong1 aSawaya, Michael R.1 aPensalfini, Anna1 aGou, Dawei1 aBerk, Arnold J.1 aGlabe, Charles G.1 aNowick, James1 aEisenberg, David0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2012 Dec. 18, v. 109, no. 51 p.20913-20918dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.12187921093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03989naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100002300169245012800192300001400320520182200334592002802156650002202184650002502206650002202231650002602253650001002279650002402289650001602313650003202329650001302361650000902374650001202383650001402395650003602409650001202445650006602457650003702523650002402560650006302584650005202647650001602699650003202715650003202747650005402779650004102833650000902874650002702883650006402910700002102974700001902995700002303014700001903037700001803056700002103074700001903095773010903114856008403223990002303307852000903330655001203339IND60097851820221123033657.0141104e20120415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009785182DNAL7 a223664302pmid7 a10.1016/j.ejphar.2012.02.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVigneault, Patrick10aGalantamine (Reminyl®) delays cardiac ventricular repolarization and prolongs the QT interval by blocking the HERG current  ap. 68-74.  aGalantamine is a reversible inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase and an allosteric-potentiating ligand of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. It is used for treating mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease. Interestingly, QT interval prolongation on the electrocardiogram (ECG), malignant ventricular arrhythmias and syncope have been reported with galantamine. Our objective was to evaluate the effects of galantamine on cardiac ventricular repolarization. Three sets of experiments were undertaken: 1) Whole cell patch-clamp experiments: HERG- or KCNQ1+KCNE1-transfected cells were exposed to galantamine 0.1–1000μmol/l (n=25 cells, total) to assess drug effect on HERG and KCNQ1+KCNE1 currents. 2) Langendorff perfusion experiments: Isolated hearts from male Hartley guinea pigs (n=9) were exposed to galantamine 1μmol/l to assess drug-induced prolongation of monophasic action potential duration measured at 90% repolarization (MAPD₉₀). 3) Cardiac telemetry experiments: Guinea pigs (n=7) implanted with wireless transmitters were injected a single intraperitoneal (i.p.) dose of galantamine 3mg/kg and 24h ECG recordings were made. 1) The estimated IC₅₀ for galantamine on HERG current was 760.2μmol/l. Moreover, galantamine 10μmol/l had a small inhibiting effect on KCNQ1+KCNE1 current (12.17±2.19% inhibition, n=10 cells). 2) While pacing at cycle lengths of 150, 200 or 250ms, galantamine 1μmol/l prolonged MAPD₉₀ by respectively 5.1±1.6ms, 9.4±1.9ms and 12.1±2.1ms. 3) Galantamine 3mg/kgi.p. caused a maximal 11.9±2.7ms prolongation of the corrected QT (QTc). Galantamine is a weak HERG blocker. This contributes to its mild QT-prolonging effect. Patients could be at risk of cardiac proarrhythmia during drug overdosage or interactions involving cytochrome 2D6 drug-metabolizing enzyme.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlzheimer disease 3aacetylcholinesterase 3aaction potentials 3acholinergic receptors 3adrugs 3aelectrocardiography 3aguinea pigs 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3apatients 3arisk 3asyncope 3atelemetry 2aAction Potentialsxdrug effects 2aAnimals 2aCholinesterase Inhibitorsxadministration & dosagextoxicity. 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aElectrocardiography 2aEther-A-Go-Go Potassium Channelsxantagonists & inhibitors 2aGalantaminexadministration & dosagextoxicity. 2aGuinea Pigs 2aInhibitory Concentration 50 2aInjections, Intraperitoneal 2aKCNQ1 Potassium Channelxantagonists & inhibitors 2aLong QT Syndromexchemically induced 2aMale 2aPatch-Clamp Techniques 2aPotassium Channels, Voltage-Gatedxantagonists & inhibitors1 aBourgault, Sarah1 aKaddar, Nisrin1 aCaillier, Bertrand1 aPilote, Sylvie1 aPatoine, Dany1 aSimard, Chantale1 aDrolet, Benoit0 tEuropean journal of pharmacology.g2012 Apr. 15, v. 681, no. 1-3 p.68-74dElsevier B.V.x0014-29997nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejphar.2012.02.0023Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03081naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002300142245008000165300002000245520203600265592002802301650001202329650002302341650001602364650002102380650001902401700002202420700001802442700002302460700002102483700001702504773013502521856007802656852000902734655001202743IND60579979620221120163401.0170907e20170906xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057997962DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.7b062012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aElacqua, Elizabeth10aSupramolecular Multiblock Copolymers Featuring Complex Secondary Structures  ap. 12240-12250.  aThis contribution introduces main-chain supramolecular ABC and ABB′A block copolymers sustained by orthogonal metal coordination and hydrogen bonding between telechelic polymers that feature distinct secondary structure motifs. Controlled polymerization techniques in combination with supramolecular assembly are used to engineer heterotelechelic π-sheets that undergo high-fidelity association with both helical and coil-forming synthetic polymers. Our design features multiple advances to achieve our targeted structures, in particular, those emulating sheet-like structural aspects using poly(p-phenylenevinylene)s (PPVs). To engineer heterotelechelic PPVs in a sheet-like design, we engineer an iterative one-pot cross metathesis–ring-opening metathesis polymerization (CM-ROMP) strategy that affords functionalized Grubbs-II initiators that subsequently polymerize a paracyclophanediene. Supramolecular assembly of two heterotelechelic PPVs is used to realize a parallel π-sheet, wherein further orthogonal assembly with helical motifs is possible. We also construct an antiparallel π-sheet, wherein terminal PPV blocks are adjacent to a flexible coil-like poly(norbornene) (PNB). The PNB is designed, through supramolecular chain collapse, to expose benzene and perfluorobenzene motifs that promote a hairpin turn via charge-transfer-aided folding. We demonstrate that targeted helix–(π-sheet)–helix and helix–(π-sheet)–coil assemblies occur without compromising intrinsic helicity, while both parallel and antiparallel β-sheet-like structures are realized. Our main-chain orthogonal assembly approach allows the engineering of multiblock copolymer scaffolds featuring diverse secondary structures via the directional assembly of telechelic building blocks. The targeted assemblies, a mix of sequence-defined helix–sheet–coil and helix–sheet–helix architectures, are Nature-inspired synthetic mimics that expose α/β and α+β protein classes via de novo design and cooperative assembly strategies.  aPublisher supplied data 3abenzene 3acomposite polymers 3aengineering 3ahydrogen bonding 3apolymerization1 aManning, Kylie B.1 aLye, Diane S.1 aPomarico, Scott K.1 aMorgia, Federica1 aWeck, Marcus0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2017 Sept. 06, v. 139, no. 35 p.12240-12250dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjacs.7b062013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03298naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100002300169245009800192300001400290520138000304592002801684650001601712650001001728650001801738650001201756650002401768650001301792650001801805650002301823650001801846650001201864650003701876650004501913650003801958650000901996650005102005650005602056650003202112650000902144650002102153650004402174650006702218650003502285650003102320700002502351700002602376700002302402700001902425700001602444700002302460773010902483856008402592990002302676852000902699655001202708IND60097851920221123033725.0141104e20120415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009785192DNAL7 a223662002pmid7 a10.1016/j.ejphar.2012.02.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEngbersen, Richard10aDifferential effects of sulfonylurea derivatives on vascular ATP-sensitive potassium channels  ap. 75-79.  aSulfonylurea drugs exert their insulinotropic action by inhibiting ATP-sensitive potassium channels in the pancreas. However, these channels are also expressed in myocardial and vascular smooth muscle, implicating possible detrimental cardiovascular effects. Aim of the present study was to investigate the inhibitory potency of various widely used sulfonylurea drugs in resistance arteries. Isolated mesenteric and renal resistance arteries mounted in a myograph and isolated perfused kidneys were used to measure drug responses. Pinacidil induced a dose-dependent relaxation of phenylephrine preconstricted mesenteric and renal arteries (pEC₅₀=6.10±0.01 and 5.66±0.03, respectively). Schild plot analysis of pinacidil relaxation curves in mesenteric arteries in the presence of sulfonylurea antagonists revealed the following order of potency: glimepiride (pA₂=7.22)≥glibenclamide (pA₂=7.05)>glipizide (pA₂=5.25)>gliclazide (pA₂=4.31). The effects of glibenclamide in renal arteries were comparable. Furthermore, glibenclamide produced similar constrictive properties in isolated renal arteries as in isolated perfused whole kidneys. We conclude that sulfonylurea drugs exert differential effects on vascular smooth muscle KATP channels. Our results suggest that glibenclamide and glimepiride will interact with these channels at therapeutic concentrations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantagonists 3adrugs 3aglibenclamide 3akidneys 3amesenteric arteries 3apancreas 3aphenylephrine 3apotassium channels 3asmooth muscle 2aAnimals 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aKATP Channelsxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aKidneyxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aMale 2aMesenteric Arteriesxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aMuscle, Smooth, Vascularxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aPhenylephrinexpharmacology 2aRats 2aRats, Inbred WKY 2aRenal Arteryxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aSulfonylurea Compoundsxadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aVasoconstrictionxdrug effects 2aVasodilationxdrug effects1 aMasereeuw, Rosalinde1 avan Gestel, Miriam A.1 aSiero, Helene L.M.1 aMoons, Miek M.1 aSmits, Paul1 aRussel, Frans G.M.0 tEuropean journal of pharmacology.g2012 Apr. 15, v. 681, no. 1-3 p.75-79dElsevier B.V.x0014-29997nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejphar.2012.02.0063Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03510naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245010900170520177900279592002802058650004402086650002202130650001502152650001602167650002202183650001802205650001502223650002402238650003702262650001902299650001102318650001902329650001802348650000702366650001702373650001502390650001402405650001302419650002302432650001602455650001502471650001402486653001402500653002502514653002402539653001802563653002902581653001602610700006002626700006002686773010402746856008502850852000902935655001202944IND60791505120221121210032.0220906e202212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079150512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2022.1141822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQalyoubi, Liyan10aRemoval of ciprofloxacin antibiotic pollutants from wastewater using nano-composite adsorptive membranes  aThe emergence of antibiotics in water has been globally recognized as a critical pollution issue. Antibiotics (such as Ciprofloxacin (CPFX) pose a serious threat to humans and to the ecosystem due to its accumulation in water sources which can lead to chronic health problems and endanger aquatic life. It is therefore crucial to properly remove them from water. In this work, a nano-composite adsorptive membrane based on Zirconium Phosphate (ZrP) adsorbent supported on Polyethersulfone (PES) was synthesized and evaluated for the removal of CPFX from synthetic aqueous solutions. The membranes described here showed a very high antibiotic removal rate. The effect of various parameters such as the initial concentration of the antibiotic, the adsorbent dosage, contact time, pH, and temperature was studied. The equilibrium data were found to reasonably best fit with the Temkin isotherm model. The membranes showed a high ciprofloxacin removal (99.7%) as opposed to (68%) when PES membrane alone was used. Moreover, a significant improvement in the membrane's water flux (100.84 L/m².h) and permeability (97.62 L/m².hr.bar) were noticed as opposed to pure PES membrane's flux and permeability. The adsorptive membranes were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET). The results confirmed the successful formation of ZrP nanoparticles adsorbent within the membrane matrix, and with enhanced hydrophilic properties. The membrane was successfully regenerated and reused up to 5 times. The results of this work showed the potential of such membranes for the removal of ciprofloxacin and at a high efficiency.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aadsorbents 3aantibiotics 3aaquatic organisms 3aciprofloxacin 3aecosystems 3aelectron microscopy 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3ahydrophilicity 3amodels 3ananocomposites 3ananoparticles 3apH 3apermeability 3aphosphates 3apollution 3aresearch 3asorption isotherms 3atemperature 3awastewater 3azirconium 0aPollution 0aAdsorptive membranes 0aZirconium phosphate 0aCiprofloxacin 0aPharmaceuticals' removal 0aAntibiotics1 aAl-Othman, Amani1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2578-98241 aAl-Asheh, Sameer1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1012-427X0 tEnvironmental research.g2022 Dec., v. 215 p.114182-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12442x0013-93517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2022.1141823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03617naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245017800161500002000339520209100359592002802450596005302478650002102531650002102552650002902573650001702602650001902619650002202638650001302660650001702673650002502690650001602715700001802731700006602749700002102815700005902836700001802895700005602913773014302969856007403112852000903186655001203195IND60744204420221120182741.0210710e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074420442DNAL7 a10.1111/jfpp.155852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeydari, Mahshid10aHydrodistillation ultrasound‐assisted green extraction of essential oil from bitter orange peel wastes: Optimization for quantitative, phenolic, and antioxidant properties  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIn this research, hydrodistillation ultrasonic‐assisted green technique was applied to extract the essential oils from bitter orange peel. The effects of independent factors (volume/mass ratio (X₁), ultrasonic time (X₂) and hydrodistillation extraction time (X₃)) on the quantitative, phenolic and antioxidant properties of essential oils were investigated. Linear and quadratic polynomial models with suitable ANOVA results (model p‐values <0.0003, R² values of 0.84–0.95, adjusted R² values of 0.82–0.90, predicted R² values of 0.71–0.75, and lack of fit p‐values >0.5) were used for fitting the responses. Two optimal extraction conditions for bitter orange peel essential oils were determined as follows: optimum responses (OR) with maximum essential oil volume (0.99 ml), maximum TPC (108.33 mg GAE/100 ml) and minimum IC₅₀ (251.56 µl) could be achieved at X₁: 6.00 ml/g, X₂: 39.10 min and X₃: 4.72 hr, and optimum phenolic compounds (OP) with maximum TPC of 190.75 mg GAE/100 ml could be obtained at X₁: 13.89 ml/gr, X₂: 3.75 min and X₃: 4.92 hr. The most predicted values for optimum conditions were in good agreement with experimental data. The disk diffusion experiments showed high antimicrobial activities of the optimum essential oils against E. coli. The GC‐MS results proved limonene was the main compound in both optimum essential oils. These bitter orange peel essential oils with suitable antioxidant and antimicrobial activities, and healthy compositions, could be considered as dietary and pharmaceutical supplements. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Peel wastes of bitter orange were used for green hydrodistillation ultrasonic‐assisted extraction of essential oil. The optimum treatments indicated a good phenolic content with suitable antioxidant and antimicrobial activity. Limonene, a pharmaceutical monoterpene hydrocarbon, was the main component of the optimum essential oils. Therefore, these environmentally friendly extracted essential oils could potentially be applied in the food and pharmaceutical industries.  aPublisher supplied data  a97731cKermanshah University of Medical Sciences 3aCitrus aurantium 3aEscherichia coli 3aantimicrobial properties 3aantioxidants 3aessential oils 3ahydrodistillation 3alimonene 3aorange peels 3aultrasonic treatment 3aultrasonics1 aRostami, Omid1 aMuḥammadī, Riz̤ā,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5572-61141 aBanavi, Parvaneh1 aFarhoodi, Mehdi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3886-43681 aSarlak, Zahra1 aRouhi, Milad1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5277-61910 tJournal of food processing and preservation.g2021 July, v. 45, no. 7 p.e15585-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl45214x0145-88927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfpp.155853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02666naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002300186245007000209300002000279506007600299520115200375592002801527506003701555650001301592650001001605650001201615650002301627650001701650650001001667650001201677650001401689650001701703650000901720651001501729653002201744653001801766653002701784653001701811700001501828700002201843700002201865700002101887773017601908856007902084852000902163655001202172IND60173571520221207120527.0150603e20121218xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017357152DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.12188791092doi7 aPMC35290922pmcid7 a232132342pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBomfleur, Benjamin10aTriassic leech cocoon from Antarctica contains fossil bell animal  ap. 20971-20974.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aOur understanding of the evolution of life on Earth is limited by the imperfection of the fossil record. One reason for this imperfect record is that organisms without hard parts, such as bones, shells, and wood, have a very low potential to enter the fossil record. Occasionally, however, exceptional fossil deposits that preserve soft-bodied organisms provide a rare glimpse of the true biodiversity during past periods of Earth history. We here present an extraordinary find of a fossil ciliate that is encased inside the wall layer of a more than 200 Ma leech cocoon from Antarctica. The microfossil consists of a helically contractile stalk that attaches to a main body with a peristomial feeding apparatus and a large C-shaped macronucleus. It agrees in every aspect with the living bell animals, such as Vorticella . Vorticellids and similar peritrichs are vital constituents of aquatic ecosystems worldwide, but so far have lacked any fossil record. This discovery offers a glimpse of ancient soft-bodied protozoan biotas, and also highlights the potential of clitellate cocoons as microscopic “conservation traps” comparable to amber.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aProtozoa 3aamber 3aanimals 3aaquatic ecosystems 3abiodiversity 3abones 3acocoons 3aevolution 3amicrofossils 3awood 3aAntarctica 0aciliate protozoan 0aLate Triassic 0aVorticella-like fossil 0apreservation1 aKerp, Hans1 aTaylor, Thomas N.1 aMoestrup, Øjvind1 aTaylor, Edith L.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2012 Dec. 18, v. 109, no. 51 p.20971-20974dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.12188791093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02860naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245011400171520143000285592002801715650002401743650001601767650002701783650001601810650001601826650001201842650002301854650001001877650002001887650002101907650002201928650001101950653001501961653001901976653001001995700001902005700001902024700002002043700002502063700002002088700002102108700002102129700002502150773010702175856008702282852000902369655001202378IND60743802220221121044114.0220110e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074380222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.1030402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMackei, Máté14aThe relationship between small heat shock proteins and redox homeostasis during acute heat stress in chickens  aAs heat stress is a major emerging issue in poultry farming, investigations on the molecular mechanisms of the heat-triggered cellular response in chickens are of special importance. In the present study, 32-day-old Ross 308 broiler chickens were subjected to 37 °C environmental temperature combined with 50% relative humidity for 4 or 8 h respectively. Following sampling, redox parameters such as malondialdehyde (MDA), reduced glutathione (GSH), protein carbonyl levels as well as glutathione peroxidase activity were assessed in liver, spleen, and kidney homogenates. The concentrations of small heat shock proteins (sHSP-s) HSP27, αA- and αB-crystallins were also investigated. Among these organs, the liver was found the most susceptible to heat-provoked oxidative stress, indicated by enhanced lipid peroxidation and rapid activation of protective pathways, including the definite increase of glutathione peroxidase activity and the excessive utilization of αA- and αB-crystallin proteins. Heat-associated decline of protein carbonylation and GSH content was observed in the liver in correlation with the increased involvement of αA- and αB-crystallins in cellular defense, resulting supposedly in an overcompensation mechanism. These data highlight the hepatic sensitivity to acute heat shock, potential adaptation mechanisms, and the specific role of sHSP-s in the restoration of physiologic cell function.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3aglutathione 3aglutathione peroxidase 3aheat stress 3ahomeostasis 3akidneys 3alipid peroxidation 3aliver 3amalondialdehyde 3aoxidative stress 3arelative humidity 3aspleen 0aHeat shock 0aα-crystallins 0aHSP271 aMátis, Gábor1 aMolnár, Andor1 aSebők, Csilla,1 aVörösházi, Júlia1 aPál, László,1 aDublecz, Károly1 aHusvéth, Ferenc1 aNeogrády, Zsuzsanna0 tJournal of thermal biology.g2021 Aug., v. 100 p.103040-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12493x0306-45657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.1030403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02884naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245010400172506010400276506007600380520098400456592002801440506003701468650002001505650001701525650001201542650001601554650001001570650001901580650001401599650000901613650001501622650001701637653000901654653001701663653002201680653000901702653002101711653000801732653000901740653000901749653000801758653000701766653000801773653000801781653000801789653000901797653000701806653000901813653000901822653002001831653000901851653001401860700002301874700006001897700002301957700002201980700001902002700002702021773010002048856005302148852000902201655001202210IND60795496820221207134250.0221004e20230301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079549682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2022.1344032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStocco, Giorgia10aPrediction accuracies of cheese-making traits using Fourier-transform infrared spectra in goat milk  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe objectives of this study were to explore the use of Fourier-transform infrared (FITR) spectroscopy on 458 goat milk samples for predicting cheese-making traits, and to test the effect of the farm variability on their prediction accuracy. Calibration equations were developed using a Bayesian approach with three different scenarios: i) a random cross-validation (CV) [80% calibration (CAL); 20% validation (VAL) set], ii) a stratified CV [(SCV), 13 farms used as CAL, and the remaining one as VAL set], and iii) a SCV where 20% of the goats randomly selected from the VAL farm were included in the CAL set (SCV₈₀). The best prediction performance was obtained for cheese yield solids, justifying for its practical application at population level. Overall results were similar to or outperformed those reported for bovine milk. Our results suggest considering specific procedures for calibration development to propose reliable tools applicable along the dairy goat chain.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBayesian theory 3acheesemaking 3acheeses 3adairy goats 3afarms 3afood chemistry 3agoat milk 3amilk 3aprediction 3aspectroscopy 0aGoat 0aCheese yield 0aNutrient recovery 0aFarm 0aInfrared spectra 0a%CY 0a%REC 0aFTIR 0aREP 0aCV 0aSCV 0aCAL 0aVAL 0aRMSE 0aR2 0aSWIR 0aMWIR 0aMWIR1 and MWIR2 0aLWIR 0aMWIR-LWIR1 aDadousis, Christos1 aPazzola, Michele1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5685-04161 aVacca, Giuseppe M.1 aDettori, Maria L.1 aMariani, Elena1 aCipolat-Gotet, Claudio0 tFood chemistry.g2023 Mar. 01, v. 403 p.134403-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2022.134403  aDNAL 7aarticle02590naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001400149245008000163520156700243592002801810650001601838650001201854650002001866650001201886650002201898650002301920650002501943650001001968651001001978700001701988700002102005773013302026856008402159852000902243655001202252IND60790794020221119150427.0220826e20220730xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079079402DNAL7 a10.3390/agriculture120811302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJi, Xing 10aHow Does China’s New Rural Pension Scheme Affect Agricultural Production?  aThis study examines the spillover effects of China’s New Rural Pension Scheme (NRPS) implemented in 2009 as a cash transfer program for agricultural production. Based on the data collected by the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Survey (CHARLS) in four periods (2011, 2013, 2015 and 2018), we employ Seemingly Unrelated Regression to explore how China’s NRPS affects agricultural production. Our findings show that NRPS pensions reduce household operating areas by 1.99 mu and agricultural investment by 1150 yuan, while increasing the labor time of their own agricultural production by 168 h, and farmers in the payment period have a similar impact. This finding is still reliable after a series of robustness tests. Gender heterogeneity analysis indicates that male participation in NRPS is more likely to reduce the actual operating area and increase the labor input of the family, while female participation in NRPS is more likely to reduce the agricultural capital input of the family. Moreover, the in-depth study of agricultural performance shows that the implementation of NRPS helps increase the average output value per mu by 700 yuan and technical efficiency by 0.2%, although this is at the cost of declining labor productivity. This study links the joint decision-making of agricultural production factor inputs with pension schemes and contributes to the development of relevant research, which may provide policy implications for how cash transfer schemes affect agricultural production and agricultural performance in other countries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagriculture 3acapital 3adecision making 3afemales 3aissues and policy 3alabor productivity 3alongitudinal studies 3amales 3aChina1 aXu, Jingwen 1 aZhang, Hongxiao 0 tAgriculture (Basel).g2022 July 30, v. 12, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12387x2077-04727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agriculture120811303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02709naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245008600167300001600253520124300269592002801512650002301540650001101563650001701574650001801591650001301609650002301622650002101645650001101666650001301677650002101690650001601711650001101727653001701738653002401755653003101779653000901810653003001819653001901849700005301868700005301921700001501974700001401989700001802003773009802021856008702119852000902206655001202215IND60613422320221119141952.0201202e20181115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061342232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.08.1242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Xuan10aCascade energy optimization for waste heat recovery in distributed energy systems  ap. 679-695.  aThe efficiency of distributed energy systems can be significantly increased through waste heat recovery from industry or power generation. The technologies used for this process are typically dependent on the quality and temperature grades of waste heat. To maximize the efficiency of cascade heat utilization, it is important to optimize the choice of waste heat recovery technologies and their operation. In this paper, a detailed mixed integer linear programming optimization model is proposed for waste heat recovery in a district-scale microgrid. The model can distinguish waste heat quality for planning and operation optimization of distributed energy systems. Heat utilization technologies are formulated in this developed model and categorized in different temperature grades. The developed model is validated using four typical cases under different settings of system operation and business models. It is found that the optimization model, by distinguishing waste heat temperature, can increase energy cost savings by around 5%, compared to models that do not consider waste heat temperature grades. Additionally, the results indicate that the developed model can provide more realistic configuration and technologies dispatch.  aPublisher supplied data 3acost effectiveness 3aenergy 3aenergy costs 3aheat recovery 3aindustry 3alinear programming 3amodel validation 3amodels 3aplanning 3apower generation 3atemperature 3awastes 0aOptimization 0aWaste heat recovery 0aCascade energy utilization 0aCCHP 0aDistributed energy system 0aEnergy quality1 aJin, Ming1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7909-45451 aFeng, Wei1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3702-55541 aShu, Gequn1 aTian, Hua1 aLiang, Youcai0 tApplied energy.g2018 Nov. 15, v. 230 p.679-695dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.08.1243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03513naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100002200180245012900202300001800331506007600349520212900425592002802554506003702582650001202619650001702631650002202648650002302670650001202693650002102705650001302726650001102739650001402750650003002764650001302794650001302807700002202820700002202842773013102864856007502995852000903070655001203079IND60539152820221207135816.0160815e20140528xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053915282DNAL7 a10.1021/ja413174b2doi7 aPMC40468842pmcid7 a247879542pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNatarajan, Aditya10aUsing Unnatural Amino Acids to Probe the Energetics of Oxyanion Hole Hydrogen Bonds in the Ketosteroid Isomerase Active Site  ap. 7643-7654.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aHydrogen bonds are ubiquitous in enzyme active sites, providing binding interactions and stabilizing charge rearrangements on substrate groups over the course of a reaction. But understanding the origin and magnitude of their catalytic contributions relative to hydrogen bonds made in aqueous solution remains difficult, in part because of complexities encountered in energetic interpretation of traditional site-directed mutagenesis experiments. It has been proposed for ketosteroid isomerase and other enzymes that active site hydrogen bonding groups provide energetic stabilization via “short, strong” or “low-barrier” hydrogen bonds that are formed due to matching of their pKₐ or proton affinity to that of the transition state. It has also been proposed that the ketosteroid isomerase and other enzyme active sites provide electrostatic environments that result in larger energetic responses (i.e., greater “sensitivity”) to ground-state to transition-state charge rearrangement, relative to aqueous solution, thereby providing catalysis relative to the corresponding reaction in water. To test these models, we substituted tyrosine with fluorotyrosines (F-Tyr’s) in the ketosteroid isomerase (KSI) oxyanion hole to systematically vary the proton affinity of an active site hydrogen bond donor while minimizing steric or structural effects. We found that a 40-fold increase in intrinsic F-Tyr acidity caused no significant change in activity for reactions with three different substrates. F-Tyr substitution did not change the solvent or primary kinetic isotope effect for proton abstraction, consistent with no change in mechanism arising from these substitutions. The observed shallow dependence of activity on the pKₐ of the substituted Tyr residues suggests that the KSI oxyanion hole does not provide catalysis by forming an energetically exceptional pKₐ-matched hydrogen bond. In addition, the shallow dependence provides no indication of an active site electrostatic environment that greatly enhances the energetic response to charge accumulation, consistent with prior experimental results.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aacidity 3aactive sites 3aaqueous solutions 3acatalytic activity 3aenzymes 3ahydrogen bonding 3aisotopes 3amodels 3aoxyanions 3asite-directed mutagenesis 3asolvents 3atyrosine1 aSchwans, Jason P.1 aHerschlag, Daniel0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2014 May 28, v. 136, no. 21 p.7643-7654dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fja413174b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02930naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245008500169300001600254520151100270592002801781650001401809650001501823650001701838650001301855650001501868650001901883650001601902650002701918650001301945650001601958650002101974650001901995653004302014653001902057653002102076653001302097653001302110700005602123700001302179700005802192700001602250773009802266856008702364852000902451655001202460IND60613422420221119142009.0201202e20181115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061342242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.08.1252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChang, Yafei10aHumidification strategy for polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells – A review  ap. 643-662.  aPolymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells are promising power sources because of their advantage such as high efficiency, zero emission and low operating temperature. Water management is one of the critical issues for polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells and has received significant attention. The membrane within the fuel cell needs to stay in hydrated state to have high ion conductivity and durability, which requires proper humidification. Both internal and external methods have been utilized to humidify the polymer electrolyte membrane. Numerous studies on fuel cell humidification have been conducted in the past decades, especially in recent years. This review aims to summarize the main humidification methods and the related studies. The internal humidification methods are classified as physical methods and chemical methods. The external humidification methods include gas bubbling humidification, direct water injection, enthalpy wheel humidification, membrane humidifiers, and exhaust gas recirculation. The working principle and performance of each method are introduced and the advantage and drawback are summarized. Further, the humidification methods for alkaline anion exchange membrane fuel cells are also briefly reviewed, because of more recent studies showing their potential of using non-precious metal catalysts. This review can help to choose proper humidification strategy for specific polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell application and may inspire further investigations.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3adurability 3aelectrolytes 3aenthalpy 3afuel cells 3ahumidification 3ahumidifiers 3aion-exchange membranes 3apolymers 3atemperature 3awater management 3azero emissions 0aPolymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell 0aHumidification 0aWater management 0aExternal 0aInternal1 aQin, Yanzhou1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2430-06411 aYin, Yan1 aZhang, Junfeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3348-89571 aLi, Xianguo0 tApplied energy.g2018 Nov. 15, v. 230 p.643-662dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.08.1253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02640naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245013100166520136500297592002801662650002201690650001601712650001901728650001701747650002101764650001601785650001701801650001501818650002001833650001301853650001701866650001401883650001401897700001601911700001701927700001601944700001301960700001901973773013301992856008402125852000902209655001202218IND60790794220221119144645.0220826e20220731xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079079422DNAL7 a10.3390/agriculture120811342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Guoyong 10aChanges in the Physiological Adaptation and Regulation Ability in Harmonia axyridis under Chlorpyrifos and Imidacloprid Stress  aAs the dominant natural enemy of aphids, Harmonia axyridis plays a crucial role in integrated pest control (IPM) in agro-ecosystems. In order to study the physiological adaptation and regulation ability of Harmonia axyridis to insecticides under chemical pesticide stress, ladybirds were treated with organophosphorus chlorpyrifos (chlorpyrifos) and new nicotine imidacloprid (imidacloprid) to explore the physiological adaptability of ladybirds under chemical pesticide stress by activating trehalose metabolism. The results showed that the imidacloprid affect the larvae develop to pupate, resulted in the H. axyridis died and significantly increased the food consumption of Harmonia axyridis, while the chlorpyrifos prolong the development period of pupae significantly and decreased significantly the food intake of H. axyridis fed with aphids treated with chlorpyrifos. It was further found that Chlorpyrifos could inhibit the activity of the trehalase, while the trehalase activity increased under imidacloprid stress, but both insecticides could decrease the trehalose content. The TRE and TPS genes of Harmonia axyridis under chlorpyrifos and imidacloprid stress were upregulated or downregulated. These relevant results can provide a strong reference for the rational use of chemical pesticides or biological pesticides to control pests in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHarmonia axyridis 3aagriculture 3aagroecosystems 3achlorpyrifos 3afood consumption 3afood intake 3aimidacloprid 3ametabolism 3anatural enemies 3anicotine 3apest control 3atrehalase 3atrehalose1 aNi, Xiaoli 1 aLiu, Meikun 1 aTang, Bing 1 aLi, Can 1 aLiu, Yangyang 0 tAgriculture (Basel).g2022 July 31, v. 12, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12387x2077-04727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agriculture120811343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02260naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100001900192245006000211300001800271506007600289520071300365592002801078596005801106596009501164596006801259596005801327506003701385650001901422650001001441650003401451650001301485700002401498700001401522700001901536700001501555700002301570700001801593773012001611856008601731852000901817655001201826IND60624934520221207101533.0191017e20180515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062493452DNAL7 a10.1093/bioinformatics/btx8452doi7 aPMC59468352pmcid7 a293008292pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Jhih-Rong10aPGA: post-GWAS analysis for disease gene identification  ap. 1786-1788.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAlthough the genome-wide association study (GWAS) is a powerful method to identify disease-associated variants, it does not directly address the biological mechanisms underlying such genetic association signals.

[Bmim][PF₆] was able to extract up to 65% of the total trans-zeatin and about 18% of the total indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) present in the sap as estimated by using a HPLC-DAD (diode array detector). However [Bmim][NTf₂] was not able to extract any of the PGRs. Furthermore, addition of [Omim][BF₄] to the sap resulted in the formation of an instant white precipitate with trans-zeatin preferentially bound on it. From the overall studies, it was concluded that [Bmim][PF₆] can be effectively used to extract PGRs from seaweeds or plant extracts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aKappaphycus alvarezii 3adiodes 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aimidazoles 3aindole acetic acid 3aionic liquids 3amacroalgae 3aplant extracts 3asap1 aPrasad, Kamalesh0 tAnalytical methods.g2015 Oct. 22, v. 7, no. 21 p.9064-9067dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ay02210j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02520naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245015000175300001600325520113800341592002801479650001701507650004101524650002201565650001601587650002001603650001101623650001501634650000701649650002401656650001301680650001601693650001001709653005301719653001701772653002201789653001401811653002301825653001001848700002101858773010101879856008501980852000902065655001202074IND60554418720221122180040.0161024e20140215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055441872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jchromb.2014.01.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPelit, Füsun Okçu10aApplication of solidified floating organic drop microextraction method for biomonitoring of chlorpyrifos and its oxon metabolite in urine samples  ap. 109-114.  aA simple, efficient and green analytical procedure for monitoring sub ppb amounts of chlorpyrifos (CP) and chlorpyrifos-oxon (CPO) in urine samples was reported. The methodology is based on the solidified floating organic drop microextraction of the analytes with a free microdrop of 2-dodecanol. The parameters those can affect the microextraction efficiency, such as solvent type, extraction solvent volume, extraction time and temperature, salt effect, pH and stirring rate on extraction were optimized. The analytes were extracted from the urine samples by using 10μL of 2-dodecanol for 40min at 70°C and then, the extracts were injected to GC-MS column by applying 100kPa injection pressure. The regression coefficients relating to linearity were at least 0.99. The accuracy of the developed method was tested upon recovery studies for CP and CPO calculated as 100±7% and 110±9% (at 0.1ngmL−1 level), respectively. LOD value for CP was found 4.8ngL−1 and for CPO it was found 3.8ngL−1. This method can easily be adopted by clinical laboratories for the contribution to policies aiming to reduce exposure of pesticides.  aPublisher supplied data 3achlorpyrifos 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3aissues and policy 3ametabolites 3amicroextraction 3amixing 3amonitoring 3apH 3aregression analysis 3asolvents 3atemperature 3aurine 0aSolidified floating organic drop microextraction 0aChlorpyrifos 0aChlorpyrifos oxon 0aPesticide 0aGas chromatography 0aUrine1 aYengin, Çiğdem0 tJournal of Chromatography B.g2014 Feb. 15, v. 949-950 p.109-114dElsevier B.V.x1570-02327nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jchromb.2014.01.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02535naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100003200139245013200171300001800303520120600321592002801527650001801555650001401573650002301587650001101610650002201621650001301643650002401656650001301680650001101693650001701704650001701721700001801738700001901756700002201775700002701797700002101824700002201845700001901867773013101886856007502017852000902092655001202101IND60539153020170621000000.0160815e20140528xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053915302DNAL7 a10.1021/ja501489h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGimbert-Suriñach, Carolina10aEfficient and Limiting Reactions in Aqueous Light-Induced Hydrogen Evolution Systems using Molecular Catalysts and Quantum Dots  ap. 7655-7661.  aHydrogen produced from water and solar energy holds much promise for decreasing the fossil fuel dependence. It has recently been proven that the use of quantum dots as light harvesters in combination with catalysts is a valuable strategy to obtain photogenerated hydrogen. However, the light to hydrogen conversion efficiency of these systems is reported to be lower than 40%. The low conversion efficiency is mainly due to losses occurring at the different interfacial charge-transfer reactions taking place in the multicomponent system during illumination. In this work we have analyzed all the involved reactions in the hydrogen evolution catalysis of a model system composed of CdTe quantum dots, a molecular cobalt catalyst and vitamin C as sacrificial electron donor. The results demonstrate that the electron transfer from the quantum dots to the catalyst occurs fast enough and efficiently (nanosecond time scale), while the back electron transfer and catalysis are much slower (millisecond and microsecond time scales). Further improvements of the photodriven proton reduction should focus on the catalytic rate enhancement, which should be at least in the hundreds of nanoseconds time scale.  aPublisher supplied data 3aascorbic acid 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acobalt 3aelectron transfer 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen production 3alighting 3amodels 3aquantum dots 3asolar energy1 aAlbero, Josep1 aStoll, Thibaut1 aFortage, Jérôme1 aCollomb, Marie-Noëlle1 aDeronzier, Alain1 aPalomares, Emilio1 aLlobet, Antoni0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2014 May 28, v. 136, no. 21 p.7655-7661dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fja501489h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02964naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245007800166300001800244500001500262520127400277592002801551650001801579650002301597650002001620650001901640650001201659650002101671650001201692650003901704650001601743650001501759650003201774650001201806650001301818650002801831653002201859653001001881653001001891653002101901653000901922653001401931653002801945653001601973700002001989700002002009700005802029700002502087700002002112700002202132700001802154773012302172856008202295852000902377655001202386IND60533039420221121200458.0160728e20140808xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053303942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2014.07.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhmed, Musaab10aDown-regulation of K+ channels by human parvovirus B19 capsid protein VP1  ap. 1396-1401.  a2019-12-06  aParvovirus B19 (B19V) can cause inflammatory cardiomyopathy and endothelial dysfunction. Pathophysiological mechanisms involved include lysophosphatidylcholine producing phospholipase A2 (PLA2) activity of the B19V capsid protein VP1. Most recently, VP1 and lysophosphatidylcholine have been shown to inhibit Na+/K+ ATPase. The present study explored whether VP1 modifies the activity of Kv1.3 and Kv1.5 K+ channels.cRNA encoding Kv1.3 or Kv1.5 was injected into Xenopus oocytes without or with cRNA encoding VP1 isolated from a patient suffering from fatal B19V-induced myocarditis. K+ channel activity was determined by dual electrode voltage clamp.Injection of cRNA encoding Kv1.3 or Kv1.5 into Xenopus oocytes was followed by appearance of Kv K+ channel activity, which was significantly decreased by additional injection of cRNA encoding VP1, but not by additional injection of cRNA encoding PLA2-negative VP1 mutant (H153A). The effect of VP1 on Kv current was not significantly modified by transcription inhibitor actinomycin (10μM for 36h) but was mimicked by lysophosphatidylcholine (1μg/ml).The B19V capsid protein VP1 inhibits host cell Kv channels, an effect at least partially due to phospholipase A2 (PLA) dependent formation of lysophosphatidylcholine.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoat proteins 3apotassium channels 3aProtoparvovirus 3acardiomyopathy 3aXenopus 3aphospholipase A2 3aoocytes 3asodium-potassium-exchanging ATPase 3amyocarditis 3aelectrodes 3aPrimate erythroparvovirus 1 3amutants 3apatients 3alysophosphatidylcholine 0aViral myocarditis 0aKv1.5 0aKv1.3 0aPhospholipase A2 0aPLA2 0aB19 virus 0aLysophosphatidylcholine 0aK+ channels1 aAlmilaji, Ahmad1 aMuñoz, Carlos,1 aElvira, Bernat1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0434-22381 aShumilina, Ekaterina1 aBock, C.-Thomas1 aKandolf, Reinhard1 aLang, Florian0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2014 Aug. 08, v. 450 p.1396-1401dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2014.07.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02824naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002000144245019600164300001800360500002000378520139000398592002801788650002301816650001401839650001201853650001501865650002901880650004401909700001801953700001501971700001801986700001802004700001702022700001702039700001502056700001702071700002002088700001402108700001702122700001902139773013302158856007802291852000902369655001202378IND60589125320221122235529.0180202e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058912532DNAL7 a10.1002/jssc.2016014432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Qingqing10aCharacterization of the potential new phthalides in Ligusticum chuanxiong Hort. using ultra‐performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time of flight tandem mass spectrometry  ap. 2123-2130.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe characterization of unknown compounds is still a great challenge currently.

This proposed strategy consisted of four steps: (1) the high resolution MS data was collected, and the peaks were screened preliminarily by UNIFIᵀᴹ platform based on the in‐house database; (2) the fragmentation patterns and the characteristic fragments were summarized based on the representative standards; (3) the target compounds were identified based on the fragmentation rules, standards comparison and false positive exclusion; (4) the unknown components were structurally characterized according to the accurate mass and fragmentation patterns analysis. This strategy was successfully applied to the identification and deduction of phthalides in Chuanxiong. A total of 81 phthalides were detected. Fifty‐five known phthalides were identified, and 26 potential new phthalides were characterized. This research enriched the material basis of Chuanxiong, and provided a liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry‐oriented method for the discovery of the potential new compounds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLigusticum sinense 3adatabases 3aisomers 3aphthalides 3atandem mass spectrometry 3aultra-performance liquid chromatography1 aWang, Meiling1 aWang, Qing1 aZhao, Huizhen1 aZhang, Zhixin1 aYu, Honghong1 aLiu, Yuehong1 aFu, Shuang1 aLü, Zhiwei,1 aHuang, Zhenghai1 aXie, Ziye1 aGao, Xiaoyan1 aQiao, Yanjiang0 tJournal of separation science.g2017 May, v. 40, no. 10 p.2123-2130dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3924049x1615-93067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jssc.2016014433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03452naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002700148245014800175300001600323520168600339592002802025650004102053650001602094650001802110650001802128650001902146650001302165650002402178650001402202650001902216650002402235650002002259650001102279650001902290650001402309650001902323650002102342650002402363650001502387651001602402651001402418653003702432653004202469653001402511653004602525653002402571653001402595700002202609700002502631700002002656773011802676856008302794852000902877655001202886IND60633959020221122223620.0190628e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063395902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jglr.2019.02.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMerriman, Katherine R.10aAssessment of site-specific agricultural Best Management Practices in the Upper East River watershed, Wisconsin, using a field-scale SWAT model  ap. 619-641.  aThe Great Lakes “Priority Watershed” effort targeted the Upper East River watershed, a 116.5-km2 tributary watershed to Wisconsin's Green Bay, to reduce its sediment and nutrients loads from agricultural sources. A Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model was created to determine the effectiveness of agricultural Best Management Practices (BMPs) funded through the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative. The model was calibrated at the monthly time-step for flow, sediment, dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP), total phosphorus (TP), nitrate, and total nitrogen (TN). Field- and watershed-scale sediment and nutrient reductions were calculated due to the implementation of 74 BMP combinations on dairy and cash grain rotations. Modeling results indicated that when multiple BMPs were placed on a field, especially those including filter strips and grassed waterways, sediment and nutrient loads generally were reduced more than single BMP implementation. The most effective in-field practice at reducing DRP and TP on dairy fields was a combination of 5 different BMPs: cover crops, crop rotation, nutrient management plan, reduced tillage, and a filter strip. Conservation cover was the single most effective practice at reducing sediment and nutrient yields. Sediment and nutrient loads decreased at the watershed scale as the quantity and coverage of BMPs increased. When all contracted BMPs were simulated at the watershed scale, sediment loads were reduced 2%, while TP, DRP, TN and nitrate loads were reduced 20%, 9%, 24%, and 17%, respectively. Modeling scenarios also indicated that over-winter manure storage was important to keep soluble nutrients out of waterways.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSoil and Water Assessment Tool model 3acover crops 3acrop rotation 3afilter strips 3amanure storage 3anitrates 3anutrient management 3anutrients 3apollution load 3areactive phosphorus 3areduced tillage 3arivers 3asediment yield 3asediments 3atotal nitrogen 3atotal phosphorus 3avegetated waterways 3awatersheds 3aGreat Lakes 3aWisconsin 0aBest management practices (BMPs) 0aSoil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) 0aNutrients 0aGreat Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI) 0aEdge-of-field (EOF) 0aGreen Bay1 aDaggupati, Prasad1 aSrinivasan, Raghavan1 aHayhurst, Brett0 tJournal of Great Lakes research.g2019 June, v. 45, no. 3 p.619-641dElsevier B.V.wJournal:2035x0380-13307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jglr.2019.02.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02569naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245015700172520113500329592002801464650003301492650002001525650001101545650001301556650002001569650001601589650001501605650001301620650001501633650002001648653002101668653002601689653002701715653004101742653003401783700001201817700001901829700001301848700001201861700002001873700001601893773010601909856008702015852000902102655001202111IND60764026820221119000645.0220222e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076402682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2022.1267562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Shuailing10aReaction of the anammox granules to various antibiotics and operating the anammox coupled denitrifying reactor for oxytetracycline wastetwater treatment  aThe anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) basedtechnology has been considered as an economic and efficient way to remove nitrogen. However, the anammox bacteria could be strongly inhibited by antibiotics. In present research, inhibiting properties of oxytetracycline, penicillin and polymyxin sulfate upon the anammox activity were investigated through batch experiment. The results implied that anammox activity was significantly inhibited by oxytetracycline and polymyxin sulfate. The non-competitive inhibiting model showed that the inhibiting constants (Ki) of oxytetracycline and polymyxin sulfate were 188.5 and 17.7 mg/L, respectively. Meanwhile, the anammox process was not suppressed while the concentration of penicillin reached 3000 mg/L. In long-run experiment, the influent oxytetracycline concentration of the anammox coupled denitrifying reactor was operated at 20 mg/L. It was observed that the anammox performance completely deteriorated, while the NO₂–-N removing efficiency reached 15.8%. The obtained findings could provide important instruction for the treatment of antibiotic contaminated wastewater.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanaerobic ammonium oxidation 3adenitrification 3amodels 3anitrogen 3aoxytetracycline 3apenicillins 3apolymyxins 3asulfates 3atechnology 3awater pollution 0aAnammox granules 0aDifferent antibiotics 0aKinetic model analysis 0aAnammox coupled denitrifying reactor 0aNitrogen removing performance1 aLi, Jun1 aWang, ChangWen1 aMa, Jing1 aLi, Zhe1 aZheng, Zhaoming1 aZhang, Jing0 tBioresource technology.g2022 Mar., v. 348 p.126756-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2022.1267563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03058naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002300186245009200209300002000301506007600321520159100397592002801988506003702016650001302053650002502066650001802091650001202109650002002121650002402141650001502165650002402180650002402204650001302228653002502241653002202266653001902288653001902307700002202326773017602348856007902524852000902603655001202612IND60178482420221207120221.0150604e20131217xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017848242DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.13093561102doi7 aPMC38707262pmcid7 a242979272pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPavlov, Michael Y.10aOptimal control of gene expression for fast proteome adaptation to environmental change  ap. 20527-20532.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBacterial populations growing in a changing world must adjust their proteome composition in response to alterations in the environment. Rapid proteome responses to growth medium changes are expected to increase the average growth rate and fitness value of these populations. Little is known about the dynamics of proteome change, e.g., whether bacteria use optimal strategies of gene expression for rapid proteome adjustments and if there are lower bounds to the time of proteome adaptation in response to growth medium changes. To begin answering these types of questions, we modeled growing bacteria as stoichiometrically coupled networks of metabolic pathways. These are balanced during steady-state growth in a constant environment but are initially unbalanced after rapid medium shifts due to a shortage of enzymes required at higher concentrations in the new environment. We identified an optimal strategy for rapid proteome adjustment in the absence of protein degradation and found a lower bound to the time of proteome adaptation after medium shifts. This minimal time is determined by the ratio between the Kullback–Leibler distance from the pre- to the postshift proteome and the postshift steady-state growth rate. The dynamics of optimally controlled proteome adaptation has a simple analytical solution. We used detailed numerical modeling to demonstrate that realistic bacterial control systems can emulate this optimal strategy for rapid proteome adaptation. Our results may provide a conceptual link between the physiology and population genetics of growing bacteria.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abacteria 3abiochemical pathways 3aculture media 3aenzymes 3agene expression 3amathematical models 3aphysiology 3apopulation genetics 3aprotein degradation 3aproteome 0abacterial adaptation 0aprotein synthesis 0acontrol theory 0aon-off control1 aEhrenberg, Måns,0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2013 Dec. 17, v. 110, no. 51 p.20527-20532dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.13093561103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02437naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006000147245012400207520093700331592002801268650003301296650001301329650001101342650001901353650001301372653001901385653002801404653001501432653002101447653002901468653002201497700005601519700005801575700002701633700005801660700005701718700006101775773010001836856008201936852000902018655001202027IND60767754620221121021104.0220321e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076775462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tca.2022.1791772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGalukhin, Andrey1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3077-381610aNovel adamantane-based dicyanate ester: Synthesis, polymerization kinetics, and thermal properties of resulting polymer  aA new adamantane-based dicyanate ester has been synthesized. The kinetics of its thermal polymerization is studied by means of conventional and temperature-modulated differential scanning calorimetry. The kinetics is analyzed comprehensively by a combination of an advanced isoconversional and model-fitting method. Polymerization proceeds via transition from a kinetic- to diffusion-control regime, which becomes operative at the later stages of the process. The kinetically-controlled regime manifests itself as a quasi-one-step auto-catalytic reaction. A contribution of diffusion to the overall kinetic is accounted for by means of the Fournier model. The polymerization product possesses excellent thermal properties (the glass transition temperature of ∼370 °C and 5% mass loss temperature of ∼480 °C), which makes it a promising candidate for application in hot-section components for aerospace and military industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aglass transition temperature 3aindustry 3amodels 3apolymerization 3apolymers 0aCyanate esters 0aPolymerization kinetics 0aAdamantane 0aThermal analysis 0aIsoconversional approach 0aDiffusion control1 aNosov, Roman1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4241-18551 aNikolaev, Ilya1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6479-44661 aKachmarzhik, Alexander1 aAleshin, Roman1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1347-37741 aIslamov, Daut1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5988-10121 aVyazovkin, Sergey1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6335-42150 tThermochimica acta.g2022 Apr., v. 710 p.179177-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11747x0040-60317nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tca.2022.1791773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03685naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006300151245015300214520190000367592002802267650002302295650002602318650001602344650002602360650001302386650001202399650000902411650000902420650001502429650001402444650001402458650001902472650001402491650001202505650001702517650001402534650001602548650001502564650001102579650001702590650001402607651001002621653002602631653002002657653001702677653001602694653002502710653003002735700006002765700002102825700006302846773010302909856008603012852000903098655001203107IND60779834620221121010607.0220809e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077983462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.micpath.2022.1056202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aElgendy, Mamdouh Y.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8627-065510aPhenotypic and molecular characterization of the causative agents of edwardsiellosis causing Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) summer mortalities  aEdwardsiellosis is a serious bacterial disease affecting Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus), causing septicemia and mortalities. Edwardsiella tarda and Edwardsiella anguillarum were isolated from Nile tilapia summer mortality events in Egypt. Diseased fish showed hemorrhagic septicemia, skin erosions, and eye opacity. A total of 24 Edwardsiella spp. isolates were retrieved from the investigated fish specimens. Phenotypic and biochemical characteristics grouped isolates into typical Ed. tarda (n = 14 strains) and atypical Ed. tarda (n = 10 strains). The BLAST analysis of sodB gene sequencing confirmed the conventional identification of typical Ed. tarda strains (n = 14) and reidentified all the atypical strains (n = 10) as Ed. anguillarum. Isolates showed a combination of virulence factors, including biofilm formation (66.6%), hemolysis (100%), chondroitinase (50%), and proteolytic activity (20.8%). The major part of isolates showed high resistance to ampicillin, amoxicillin, gentamycin antibiotics and harbored tetA, blaCTX₋M, and aadA1 resistance genes. Pathogenicity testing of isolates in O. niloticus confirmed their virulence. Challenged fish exhibited septicemic signs similar to naturally diseased fish. Infections in naturally infected tilapia triggered acute and chronic histopathological alterations. Degenerative and necrotic changes were noticed in hematopoietic organs. Granulomas were noticed in between the hepatic parenchyma. The data extracted from the study confirm that accurate identification of the causative agents of edwardsiellosis should be reliant on genetic-based approaches. Analysis of the bacterium virulence properties offers insights into establishing novel therapeutics for edwardsiellosis control. The findings refer to the need for antimicrobial sensitivity testing to minimize antimicrobial resistance and increase therapy efficacy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEdwardsiella tarda 3aOreochromis niloticus 3aamoxicillin 3aantibiotic resistance 3abacteria 3abiofilm 3aeyes 3afish 3agentamicin 3agranuloma 3ahemolysis 3ahistopathology 3amortality 3aopacity 3apathogenesis 3aphenotype 3aproteolysis 3asepticemia 3asummer 3atherapeutics 3avirulence 3aEgypt 0aAntibiotic resistance 0aEdwardsiellosis 0aNile tilapia 0aMortalities 0asodB gene sequencing 0aVirulence characteristics1 aSherif, Ahmed H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7739-01291 aKenawy, Amany M.1 aAbdelsalam, Mohamed1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1406-70300 tMicrobial pathogenesis.g2022 Aug., v. 169 p.105620-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11911x0882-40107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micpath.2022.1056203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03648naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001600144245013300160300002000293520204400313592002802357650001602385650001302401650001702414650001902431650001802450650001102468650001502479650001902494650001802513650001302531650001902544650002802563650002902591650001502620650001302635650002302648653003402671653003102705653001902736653001802755653001702773700002002790700001602810700001802826700005702844773014202901856007803043852000903121655001203130IND60686765320221120074129.0200318e20200228xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068676532DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.0c002592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Shiwei10aCustom-Tailoring Loose Nanofiltration Membrane for Precise Biomolecule Fractionation: New Insight into Post-Treatment Mechanisms  ap. 13327-13337.  aLoose nanofiltration (NF) membranes with diverse selectivity can meet the great demands in various bioseparation applications. Thus, a facile strategy to tune the properties such as pore size, surface charge, and hydrophilicity of the NF membrane is required to produce tailor-made loose NF membranes without changing the existing production line. Herein, we systematically investigated the post-treatment of the nascent poly(piperazine amide) NF membranes using different reagents (organic acids, weak bases, organic solvents and ionic liquid (IL)). Various characterizations revealed that the skin/separation layer became looser and permeance was promoted with the decrease of salt rejection in varying degrees. It was found that the O/N ratio did not rigorously represent the cross-linking degree of the skin layer, because besides the hydrolysis of the residual acyl chloride impeding the amido bond formation, the breaking of existing amido bonds and the grafting of free trimesoyl chloride molecules on the nascent membranes could also increase the O/N ratio during post-treatments. Then three mechanisms including hydrolysis, swelling rearrangement and capping reaction effects were proposed to better understand the membrane properties variations. All these effects resulted in larger pore size of the NF membrane, and the hydrolysis/capping effect might increase negative charge and hydrophilicity on the membrane, while the swelling rearrangement could produce less defective skin structure. These three effects might be involved together during a single treatment. Finally, the NF membrane post-treated by N-hexane could efficiently separate antibiotics and NaCl with the highest permeate flux, whereas the one post-treated by ionic liquid outperformed others for the decoloration of cane molasses (much more efficient than NF270, DL, and NTR7450 membranes). The long-term operating stability of the post-treated membranes selected was also confirmed by a continuous crossflow filtration for 15 h with regular alkaline cleaning.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibiotics 3acleaning 3acrosslinking 3adecolorization 3afractionation 3ahexane 3ahydrolysis 3ahydrophilicity 3aionic liquids 3amolasses 3ananofiltration 3aorganic acids and salts 3aorganochlorine compounds 3apiperazine 3aporosity 3atrimesoyl chloride 0aloose nanofiltration membrane 0ainterfacial polymerization 0apost-treatment 0abioseparation 0aTFC membrane1 aChen, Xiangrong1 aWan, Yinhua1 aFeng, Shichao1 aLuo, Jianquan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9949-77790 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2020 Feb. 28, v. 12, no. 11 p.13327-13337dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c002593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02598naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002300152245015200175520112100327592002801448650001601476650001401492650002401506650001701530650001601547650001501563650002201578650002201600650002201622650002401644650001901668650001601687653001701703653001601720653002201736653003301758653002401791700001601815700002101831700002801852700002101880700002501901773010601926856008702032852000902119655001202128IND60764026920221119000521.0220314e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076402692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2022.1267572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoura, Konstantina12aA critical review for advances on industrialization of immobilized cell Bioreactors: Economic evaluation on cellulose hydrolysis for PHB production  aAdvances such as cell-on-cell immobilization, multi-stage fixed bed tower (MFBT) bioreactor, promotional effect on fermentation, extremely low temperature fermentation, freeze dried immobilized cells in two-layer fermentation, non-engineered cell factories, and those of recent papers are demonstrated.

The way proteins interact to generate curvature remains largely unclear, especially at early stages of membrane remodeling. Using a coarse-grained model of Bin/amphiphysin/Rvs domain with an N-terminal helix (N-BAR) interacting with flat membranes and vesicles, we demonstrate that at low protein surface densities, binding of N-BAR domain proteins to the membrane is followed by a linear aggregation and the formation of meshes on the surface. In this process, the proteins assemble at the base of emerging membrane buds. Our work shows that beyond a more straightforward scaffolding mechanism at high bound densities, the interplay of anisotropic interactions and the local stress imposed by the N-BAR proteins results in deep invaginations and endocytic vesicular bud-like deformations, an order of magnitude larger than the size of the individual protein. Our results imply that by virtue of this mechanism, cell membranes may achieve rapid local increases in protein concentration.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadhesion 3abuds 3acell membranes 3adeformation 3amembrane proteins 3amodels 0acoarse-grained simulation 0amembrane stress 0aself-assembly 0amembrane curvature 0aGaussian curvature1 aSrivastava, Anand1 aVoth, Gregory A.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2013 Dec. 17, v. 110, no. 51 p.20396-20401dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.13098191103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02147naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245015700159300002000316520097400336592002801310650002401338650002301362650001501385650001701400650001301417650001201430650002601442650001901468650001101487650001101498700002001509700001901529700001801548773012401566856007401690852000901764655001201773IND60667206320221119224328.0190919e20150211xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066720632DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra15767b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Yoon-Sung10aHigh performance composite polymer electrolytes for lithium-ion polymer cells composed of a graphite negative electrode and LiFePO₄ positive electrode  ap. 18359-18366.  aCore–shell structured SiO₂ particles with different core diameters were synthesized by radical polymerization of 4-styrenesulfonic acid sodium salt with vinyl-functionalized SiO₂ core particles and were used as Li⁺ ion-conducting fillers in composite polymer electrolytes.

Surface water samples were collected during flood stage (May 2–4, 2011; n = 15) and after (July 25–26, 2011; n = 8) from four different cities along the Ohio River and were analyzed for the presence of microbial indicators, pathogens, metals, and chemical contaminants. Contaminant concentrations during and after flooding were compared using linear and logistic regression. Surface water samples collected during flooding had higher levels of E. coli , enterococci, Salmonella , Campylobacter , E. coli O157:H7, adenovirus, arsenic, copper, iron, lead, and zinc compared to surface water samples collected 3-months post-flood (P < 0.05). These results suggest that flooding increases microbial and chemical loads in surface water. These findings reinforce commonly recommended guidelines to limit exposure to flood water and to appropriately sanitize contaminated surfaces and drinking wells after contamination by flood water.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCampylobacter 3aEnterococcus 3aEscherichia coli O157 3aSalmonella 3aarsenic 3acities 3acopper 3adrinking water 3aenvironmental health 3aguidelines 3airon 3alead 3apathogens 3aregression analysis 3asanitizing 3asurface water 3awater pollution 3awells 3azinc 3aKentucky 3aOhio River 0aNatural disaster 0aemergency response 0afloods1 aMurphy, Matthew W.1 aSchneeberger, Chandra1 aNarayanan, Jothikumar1 aHoo, Elizabeth1 aFreiman, Alexander1 aLewis, Lauren S.1 aHill, Vincent R.0 tJournal of environmental science and health.g2014 Sept. 19, v. 49, no. 11 p.1236-1243dTaylor & Francisx1532-41177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10934529.2014.9100363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03338naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002100144245012500165300001600290520180700306592002802113650001302141650002102154650002302175650001302198650001202211650001202223650001202235650001202247650001102259650001502270650001202285650001502297650002302312650002402335650001302359650001602372653001302388653001202401653002602413653002202439653001302461700001902474700002602493700002502519700002302544700002202567773013202589856007802721852000902799655001202808IND60643917020221122194521.0190514s2018    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064391702DNAL7 a10.1139/apnm-2017-05772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJackson, Matthew10aExercise training and weight loss, not always a happy marriage: single blind exercise trials in females with diverse BMI  ap. 363-370.  aIndividuals show high variability in body weight responses to exercise training. Expectations and motivation towards effects of exercise on body weight might influence eating behaviour and could conceal regulatory mechanisms. We conducted 2 single-blind exercise trials (4 weeks (study 1) and 8 weeks (study 2)) with concealed objectives and exclusion of individuals with weight loss intention. Circuit exercise training programs (3 times a week (45–90 min), intensity 50%–90% peak oxygen uptake for 4 and 8 weeks) were conducted. Thirty-four females finished the 4-week intervention and 36 females the 8-week intervention. Overweight/obese (OV/OB) and lean female participants’ weight/body composition responses were assessed and fasting and postprandial appetite hormone levels (PYY, insulin, amylin, leptin, ghrelin) were measured before and after the intervention for understanding potential contribution to individuals’ body weight response to exercise training (study 2). Exercise training in both studies did not lead to a significant reduction of weight/body mass index (BMI) in the participants’ groups; however, lean participants gained muscle mass. Appetite hormones levels were significantly (p < 0.05) altered in the OV/OB group, affecting fasting (−24%) and postprandial amylin (−14%) levels. Investigation of individuals’ BMI responses using multiple regression analysis revealed that levels of fasting leptin, postprandial amylin increase, and BMI were significant predictors of BMI change, explaining about 43% of the variance. In conclusion, tested exercise training did not lead to weight loss in female participants, while a considerable proportion of variance in body weight response to training could be explained by individuals’ appetite hormone levels and BMI.  aPublisher supplied data 3aappetite 3abody composition 3aeducation programs 3aexercise 3afasting 3afemales 3aghrelin 3ainsulin 3aleptin 3amotivation 3amuscles 3aoverweight 3apeak oxygen uptake 3aregression analysis 3avariance 3aweight loss 0aexercise 0aobesity 0abody mass maintenance 0aenergy regulation 0ahormones1 aFatahi, Fardin1 aAlabduljader, Kholoud1 aJelleyman, Charlotte1 aMoore, Jonathan P.1 aKubis, Hans-Peter0 tApplied physiology, nutrition and metabolism.g2018, v. 43, no. 4 p.363-370dNRC Research PresswJournal:23115x1715-53207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/apnm-2017-05773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02761naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245011000164520161300274592002801887650000801915650002401923650001601947650001701963650000901980650001101989650001802000650001402018650001402032653002402046653001502070653002102085653002502106700006502131773010002196856008202296852000902378655001202387IND60767754820221121052128.0220321e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076775482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tca.2022.1791792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAslan, Cemal10aFormation mechanism of strontium cobaltite containing equimolar amounts of Sr and Co from SrCO3 and Co3O4  aStrontium cobaltite containing equimolar amounts of Sr and Co was produced by heating the mixture of SrCO₃ and Co₃O₄ starting materials with a mole ratio of 1:0.333 under dynamic air atmosphere. The chemical reactions occurred during heating were determined and the intermediate and final products obtained at each critical temperature were characterized using TG/DTA-MS, ICP-OES, XRD and FT-IR analytical techniques. The volumetric analysis method (iodometric titration) and carbonation process were carried out to determine the oxygen stoichiometry of strontium cobaltite. It was determined by thermal analysis results that pure SrCO₃ and Co₃O₄ were decomposed to SrO and CoO final products, respectively. Sr₆Co₅O₁₅₋ᵦ was formed by solid-state reaction between SrO and Co₃O₄ and by gaining O₂ from air. Sr₂Co₂O₅₋δ was produced at elevated temperatures by solid-state reaction between Sr₆Co₅O₁₅₋ᵦ and Co₃O₄ by releasing O₂. At temperature where the decomposition of SrCO₃ is not completed and the decomposition temperature of Co₃O₄ is reached, firstly the formation of Sr₆Co₅O₁₅₋ᵦ and then Sr₂Co₂O₅₋δ takes place with CoO instead of Co₃O₄. Strontium cobaltite releases oxygen from its structure during heating as the temperature increases in the air atmosphere and it gains oxygen during cooling as the temperature decreases. Sr₂Co₂O₅₋δ is converted firstly to Sr₆Co₅O₁₅ and CoO and then CoO reacts with O₂ to form Co₃O₄ when cooled to the room temperature from the temperature it was obtained.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aambient temperature 3acarbonation 3acobalt oxide 3aheat 3aoxygen 3astoichiometry 3astrontium 3atitration 0aStrontium cobaltite 0aPerovskite 0aThermal analysis 0aSolid-state reaction1 aKalpakli, Ahmet Orkun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8382-40850 tThermochimica acta.g2022 Apr., v. 710 p.179179-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11747x0040-60317nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tca.2022.1791793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03304naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002000153245016900173300001600342520195700358592002802315650002902343650001502372650001302387650001502400650001002415650001102425650001602436650001702452650001902469651001402488653001702502653001802519653002102537653002002558700001502578700002302593700002202616700003002638773010602668856008702774852000902861655001202870IND60563767620221121165856.0170713e20160301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056376762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2015.12.0582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBănăduc, Doru14aThe Lower Danube River–Danube Delta–North West Black Sea: A pivotal area of major interest for the past, present and future of its fish fauna — A short review  ap. 137-151.  aThe complex Danube–Black Sea geoecosystem, created by a unique combination of integrated biotopes and biocoenoses related forces and counter-forces in time and space, forms a rich “ichthyosystem”. The equilibrium among the fish species captured in the Danube Delta reveals its structural and functional roles in the connectivity of the Danube and Black Sea. The key role of the delta is evidenced by the fact that 57.26% of the Lower Danube–Danube Delta–North West Black Sea fish species use two or three of the subsystems in terms of habitats. Therefore, this convergence area can be considered to be a dynamic and rich “ichthyosystem”, with three subsystems. All three evolved interdependently, which permits their flexibility and adaptation in an interdependent way. The habitat heterogeneity, native economic and conservation priority fish species of the Lower Danube–Danube Delta–North Western Black Sea have decreased significantly, and there are no indications that this trend will be halted soon. The Danube “sub-ichtyosystem” seems to be more directly affected than the others. The Lower Danube–Danube Delta–North Western Black Sea “ichthyosystem” exhibits a significant level of flexibility, resilience and adaptation over geological time, but has become much more sensitive to environmental perturbations due to the last century of human impact. This “ichthyosystem” is affected by non-native fish species. The study area represents an interdependent ecological net, without which the specific “ichthyosystem” formed over geological time will disappear. The studied ecological net fish fauna is an accurate indicator of various human pressures. The Lower Danube–Danube Delta–North West Black Sea geoecosystem, in which the Danube Delta provides the pivotal habitat element, is the matrix for a unique “ichthyosystem.” However, human impacts decrease its resilience and can induce its extinction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropogenic activities 3abiocenosis 3abiotopes 3aextinction 3afauna 3ahumans 3amarine fish 3ariver deltas 3aspace and time 3aBlack Sea 0aGeoecosystem 0aIchthyosystem 0aSpatial dynamics 0aTemporal trends1 aRey, Sonia1 aTrichkova, Teodora1 aLenhardt, Mirjana1 aCurtean-Bănăduc, Angela0 tScience of the total environment.g2016 Mar. 01, v. 545-546 p.137-151dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2015.12.0583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02646naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100006200144245009000206300002000296520104700316592002801363650002801391650001401419650002401433650001601457650001601473653002301489653001801512653003701530653002901567653002001596653001301616653002701629700006601656700006001722700006701782700002101849700005501870700005701925773014201982856007902124852000902203655001202212IND60686765520221120062449.0210220e20200226xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068676552DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.0c003482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrillo, Alessandro1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8909-986510aObservation of 2D Conduction in Ultrathin Germanium Arsenide Field-Effect Transistors  ap. 12998-13004.  aWe report the fabrication and electrical characterization of germanium arsenide (GeAs) field-effect transistors with ultrathin channels. The electrical transport is investigated in the 20–280 K temperature range, revealing that the p-type electrical conductivity and the field-effect mobility are growing functions of temperature. An unexpected peak is observed in the temperature dependence of the carrier density per area at ∼75 K. Such a feature is explained considering that the increased carrier concentration at higher temperatures and the vertical band bending combined with the gate field lead to the formation of a two-dimensional (2D) conducting channel, limited to few interfacial GeAs layers, which dominates the channel conductance. The conductivity follows the variable-range hopping model at low temperatures and becomes the band-type at higher temperatures when the 2D channel is formed. The formation of the 2D channel is validated through a numerical simulation that shows excellent agreement with the experimental data.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectrical conductivity 3agermanium 3amathematical models 3atemperature 3atransistors 0agermanium arsenide 0a2D conduction 0atemperature-dependent conduction 0afield-effect transistors 0acarrier density 0amobility 0avariable-range hopping1 aDi Bartolomeo, Antonio1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3629-726X1 aUrban, Francesca1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2109-13701 aPassacantando, Maurizio1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3680-52951 aCaridad, Jose M.1 aSun, Jianbo1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9741-87261 aCamilli, Luca1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2498-02100 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2020 Feb. 26, v. 12, no. 11 p.12998-13004dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c003483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02999naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245018000169520131000349592002801659650001401687650002701701650002201728650002801750650001301778650001501791650002601806650001601832650002001848650000901868650001701877650001901894650001501913650001101928650001701939650001501956653001501971653002601986653002602012653001402038653001402052653001302066700001702079700001502096700001402111700002002125700001602145700001402161700001702175700001602192700001502208773010302223856008602326852000902412655001202421IND60779834920221121010211.0220809e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077983492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.micpath.2022.1056232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Jiajing10aInhibitory effect of probiotic Bacillus spp. isolated from the digestive tract of Rhynchocypris Lagowskii on the adhesion of common pathogenic bacteria in the intestinal model  aDiseases of fish caused by pathogenic bacteria are an important constraint on aquaculture production. Antibiotics have been widely used to control infectious diseases, but this has led to the emergence of drug-resistant bacteria and affected human health. In this context, probiotics are used as an alternative to antibiotics for the prevention and control of diseases in aquaculture. The aim of this study was to obtain probiotic candidate strains of Bacillus spp. from the gut of Rhynchocypris Lagowskii. Strains were screened by enzyme-producing ability, antagonism assay and antibiotic susceptibility. The safety of the strains to host fish has also been established. The isolated Bacillus licheniformis (LSG1-1) and Bacillus subtilis (LSG2-1) were characterized and performed well in tolerance experiments. In addition, LSG1-1 and LSG2-1 were detected to have higher self-aggregation ability and surface hydrophobicity. In the in vitro adhesion model, LSG1-1 and LSG2-1 showed good adhesion ability and had obvious adhesion inhibitory effect on three pathogens of Aeromonas. Based on the characteristics observed so far, Bacillus licheniformis LSG1-1 and Bacillus subtilis LSG2-1 could form potential probiotic candidates in the digestive tract of R. lagowskii to help combat diseases in aquaculture.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAeromonas 3aBacillus licheniformis 3aBacillus subtilis 3aRhynchocypris lagowskii 3aadhesion 3aantagonism 3aantibiotic resistance 3aaquaculture 3adigestive tract 3afish 3ahuman health 3ahydrophobicity 3aintestines 3amodels 3apathogenesis 3aprobiotics 0aProbiotics 0aAntibiotic resistance 0aAntagonistic activity 0aPathogens 0aTolerance 0aAdhesion1 aWu, Zhenchao1 aWang, Seng1 aWang, Xin1 aZhang, Dongming1 aWang, Qiuju1 aLin, Lili1 aWang, Guiqin1 aGuo, Zhixin1 aChen, Yuke0 tMicrobial pathogenesis.g2022 Aug., v. 169 p.105623-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11911x0882-40107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micpath.2022.1056233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02827naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005400144245011600198300002000314520134800334592002801682650001501710650001501725650001501740650001501755650001501770650001301785650001901798653002001817653002201837653002001859653001401879653001401893653002001907700001301927700001801940700005601958700005602014700002102070700006102091773014202152856007802294852000902372655001202381IND60686765620221120074116.0200318e20200226xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068676562DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.0c004482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJin, Taiyu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0315-865010aUltrathin Nanofibrous Membranes Containing Insulating Microbeads for Highly Sensitive Flexible Pressure Sensors  ap. 13348-13359.  aHighly sensitive and flexible pressure sensors were developed based on dielectric membranes composed of insulating microbeads contained within polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) nanofibers. The membrane is fabricated using a simple electrospinning process. The presence of the microbeads enhances porosity, which in turn enhances the sensitivity (1.12 kPa–¹ for the range of 0–1 kPa) of the membrane when used as a pressure sensor. The microbeads are fixed in position and uniformly distributed throughout the nanofibers, resulting in a wide dynamic range (up to 40 kPa) without any sensitivity loss. The fluffy and nonsticky PVDF nanofiber features low hysteresis and ultrafast response times (∼10 ms). The sensor has also demonstrated reliable pressure detection over 10 000 loading cycles and 250 bending cycles at a 13 mm bending radius. These pressure sensors were successfully applied to detect heart rate and respiratory signals, and an array of sensors was fabricated and used to recognize spatial pressure distribution. The sensors described herein are ultrathin and ultralight, with a total thickness of less than 100 μm, including the electrodes. All of the materials comprising the sensors are flexible, making them suitable for on-body applications such as tactile sensors, electronic skins, and wearable healthcare devices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectrodes 3aheart rate 3ahysteresis 3amicrobeads 3ananofibers 3aporosity 3athermoplastics 0awearable device 0acapacitive sensor 0apressure sensor 0amicrobead 0ananofiber 0aelectrospinning1 aPan, Yan1 aJeon, Guk-Jin1 aYeom, Hye-In1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9370-26201 aZhang, Shuye1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0170-38351 aPaik, Kyung-Wook1 aPark, Sang-Hee Ko1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7165-82110 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2020 Feb. 26, v. 12, no. 11 p.13348-13359dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c004483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02288naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245009300169300001400262520130700276592002801583650001801611650001101629650001301640653001101653653001501664653001101679653001501690653001601705700001901721773012701740856008601867852000901953655001201962IND60768583920221117060555.0220301e20220102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076858392DNAL7 a10.1080/09715010.2020.18329242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRahman, Sadia10aPhysical assessment of wave forces on bridge girder impacted by potential tsunami hazard  ap. 72-78.  aBridges are one of the most susceptible structural elements that can be viciously impacted by tsunami disaster. During the latest few tsunami hazards, a number of bridges were affected severely due to the lack of proper incorporation of tsunami forces in design guidelines. Therefore, it becomes imperative to evaluate the stability of bridges through the analysis of tsunami-induced forces on bridge structures. In the present study, laboratory experiments were carried out to quantify the exerted tsunami forces on girder model. Broken waves along with unbroken waves were considered for the analysis purpose. The maximum horizontal forces were larger for the broken waves than the unbroken waves. Results showed that the initial impact forces were larger than the hydrodynamic forces for broken waves whereas the opposite was true for unbroken waves. Measured forces on girder model, located in higher position, were larger and increased with increasing wave height. Lower girder position showed better performance than higher girder position regardless of wave height. One predictive formula was proposed to estimate the horizontal wave pressure on the seaward side of girder using as input the wave height and girder height. The normalized wave pressure increased as tsunami wave height increased.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahydrodynamics 3amodels 3atsunamis 0aBridge 0awave force 0agirder 0awave forms 0awave height1 aKhan, M.

Yet, knowledge regarding the underlying mechanisms by which mercury exposures are translated into biological effects remains incomplete. DNA methylation is an epigenetic modification that is sensitive to environmental cues, and alterations in DNA methylation at the global level are associated with a variety of diseases. Using a liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry-based (LC–MS/MS) approach, global DNA methylation levels were measured in red blood cells of 144 wild American alligators (Alligator mississippiensis) from 6 sites with variable levels of mercury contamination across Florida's north–south axis. Variation in mercury concentrations measured in whole blood was highly associated with location, allowing the comparison of global DNA methylation levels across different “treatments” of mercury. Global DNA methylation in alligators across all locations was weakly associated with increased mercury exposure. However, a much more robust relationship was observed in those animals sampled from locations more highly contaminated with mercury. Also, similar to other vertebrates, global DNA methylation appears to decline with age in alligators. The relationship between age-associated loss of global DNA methylation and varying mercury exposures was examined to reveal a potential interaction. These findings demonstrate that global DNA methylation levels are associated with mercury exposure, and give insights into interactions between contaminants, aging, and epigenetics.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAlligator mississippiensis 3aDNA methylation 3aadverse effects 3aalligators 3aepigenetics 3aerythrocytes 3aliquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3amercury 3aFlorida 0aDNA methylation 0aMercury 0aAmerican alligator 0aEnvironmental contaminants 0aLiquid chromatography 0aMass spectrometry 0aDeoxyribonucleoside1 aParrott, Benjamin B.1 aBowden, John A.1 aKassim, Brittany L.1 aSomerville, Stephen E.1 aBryan, Teresa A.1 aBryan, Colleen E.1 aLange, Ted R.1 aDelaney, J.

This work aims to report the used analytical methods that allowed identification of the main plant toxins in biological samples from an equid (an Arabian horse) fatality related to hemlock water dropwort (Oenanthe crocata Linnaeus) intake. Using both LC-DAD and LC-HRMS methods allowed identification (i) of oenanthotoxin in roots found on the site, root fragments found in the stomach, stomach content, kidney, and liver, and (ii) of the hydrogenated metabolite of oenanthotoxin (2,3-dihydro-oenanthotoxin) in roots found on the site, root fragments found in the stomach, stomach content, kidney, liver and spleen. Reported analytical data about Oenanthe crocata toxins can be useful for identification of the ingested plant and for supporting a poisoning diagnosis in such cases.  aPublisher supplied data 3adeath 3ahorses 3akidneys 3aliver 3amass spectrometry 3ametabolites 3aspleen 3astomach 0aOenanthe crocata poisoning 0aHorse 0aOenanthotoxin 0a2,3-dihydro-oenanthotoxin 0aLC-HRMS 0aLC-DAD1 aRobveille, Cynthia1 aGicquel, Thomas1 aAllorge, Delphine1 aGault, Gilbert1 aGaulier, Jean-Michel0 tToxicon.g2022 Apr. 30, v. 210 p.39-43dElsevier LtdwJournal:6279x0041-01017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.toxicon.2022.02.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02752naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245012900166300001800295520109500313536024401408592002801652596001301680596004901693650000701742650001601749650001501765650001301780653003601793653002201829653002601851700001501877700002101892700002001913700001901933700001501952700002101967700002101988700001802009700003302027773015102060856008602211852000902297655001202306IND60768584120221117055541.0220225e20220403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076858412DNAL7 a10.1080/10643389.2020.18498932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAli, Imran10a3-Dimensional membrane capsules: Synthesis modulations for the remediation of environmental pollutants – A critical review  ap. 1092-1153.  aRecently, 3-dimensional membrane capsules (3-D MCs) have attracted great attention and have been frequently utilized for removal of the environmental pollutants due to their plentiful oxygen-containing/hydrophilic functional groups, wide operational pH range, desired morphology and higher selectivity against targeted contaminants. Moreover, potentially toxic metals and refractory organic pollutants have been successfully eliminated by encapsulating 2-D materials, chemical oxidants, chelating agents/resins and a variety of enzymes into 3 D MCs. Therefore, this review is the first attempt to emphasize the recent developments in the synthesis modulations of 3-D MCs and factors affecting their fabrication relationship with performance, and removal mechanisms of various pollutants by 3-D MCs. Further, the barriers to the marketing and transfer of 3-D MC based remediation technologies from laboratory to commercial applications are also discussed. Finally, the research gaps and their prospects are also debated to open new windows of research and practical application of 3-D MCs.  aThis work was supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 21777104), and the Science and Technology Planning Project of Shenzhen Municipality (Grant Nos.

Such fission–fusion dynamics are often modulated by seasonal changes in resources. We examined the seasonal variation in group size and social structure of female Asian elephants, which show high fission–fusion dynamics, in a population in southern India. Females in this population form many distinct communities or clans in both the dry and wet seasons. At the population level, females were sighted in larger group sizes and associated with more uncommon females in the dry season. However, when associations among common females were considered, a greater number of stronger associations were observed in the wet season. There were no consistently significant seasonal differences in group sizes or associations at the clan level. Thus, population-level results, obtained by a combination of results from different clans, may sometimes be misleading. Female associations showed some temporal stability, with association indices being moderately correlated across consecutive seasons and years. Interestingly, average group sizes were similar across clans of different sizes, indicating a restriction on group size, possibly due to resource distribution. In spite of this restriction, most clan-mates showed low, non-zero associations amongst themselves rather than very strong associations with a small set of individuals. The resulting fluid rather than fixed groups suggest a benefit to socializing with other clan-mates. Thus, unlike the pattern usually seen, fission–fusion dynamics here is a means to maintain multiple associates under conditions of relatively constant but constrained group size, rather than being a means of increasing or decreasing group size in response to ecological factors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aElephas maximus 3aanimal behavior 3adry season 3aenvironmental factors 3afemales 3agroup size 3aseasonal variation 3asocial structure 3awet season 3aIndia 0aAsian elephant 0aassociation network 0afission–fusion 0agroup size 0amultilevel society 0aseasonality 0asocial organization1 aKeerthipriya, P.1 aVidya, T.N.C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7143-90080 tAnimal behaviour.g2017 Dec., v. 134 p.135-145dElsevier LtdaThe Association for the Study of Animal BehaviourwJournal:jnl45841x0003-34727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2017.10.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02995naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245012200175300001800297520142400315592002801739650001601767650001901783650001301802650001501815650001301830650001601843650002501859650002001884650001501904650002801919650003101947650001001978650002301988650001202011650001402023650001102037650001102048650004402059651001402103653002002117653002102137653002502158653003302183700002002216700002202236773012602258856008402384852000902468655001202477IND60122357120221121034920.0150325e20140919xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012235712DNAL7 a10.1080/10934529.2014.9100652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBianchi, Virginia A.10aBiomarker responses to sewage pollution in freshwater mussels (Diplodon chilensis) transplanted to a Patagonian river  ap. 1276-1285.  aField and laboratory experiments were combined to evaluate biomarker responses of Diplodon chilensis to sewage pollution. Mussels from an unpolluted area in Lacar lake (S0) were caged at a reference site (S1) and at two sites with increasing sewage pollution (S2, S3) in Pocahullo river (all in Argentina). After 1 month, gill (g) glutathione S-transferase (GST) and catalase (CAT) activities, and lipid peroxidation (TBARS) were found to be significantly elevated in S3, gGST being positively correlated with fecal bacteria (FC) concentration. Digestive gland (dg) enzyme activities were depressed and dgTBARS were increased in all transplanted mussels. After 3 mo, most variables returned to control levels in S1 mussels except for dgCAT and dgTBARS. After seven months, GST and CAT activities of S0 and S3 mussels were evaluated in the laboratory, before and after acute exposure (8 h) to high fecal bacteria concentration ([FC] in S3x 2). gGST increased in both groups, while dgGST responded only in S3 mussels. gCAT and dgCAT activities were similarly increased by acute exposure in both groups. Our results suggest that gGST and gCAT are suitable biomarkers for high FC pollution regardless of previous exposure history. In addition, we show that dgCAT is sensitive to the acute increase in FC load, both in naive and long-term exposed individuals, while dgGST becomes responsive after long-term acclimatization.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacclimation 3aacute exposure 3abacteria 3abiomarkers 3acatalase 3acorrelation 3aenvironmental health 3aenzyme activity 3afreshwater 3aglutathione transferase 3alaboratory experimentation 3alakes 3alipid peroxidation 3amussels 3apollution 3arivers 3asewage 3athiobarbituric acid-reactive substances 3aArgentina 0aFecal coliforms 0aoxidative stress 0adetoxifying defenses 0ashort and long-term response1 aRocchetta, Iara1 aLuquet, Carlos M.0 tJournal of environmental science and health.g2014 Sept. 19, v. 49, no. 11 p.1276-1285dTaylor & Francisx1532-41177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10934529.2014.9100653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02385naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245009200167300001400259520095800273592002801231650001601259650002401275650001801299650001101317650004101328650001401369650001301383650003401396650001801430650000901448650000701457650001201464650001101476650003201487650002501519653002501544653001801569653002101587653002201608653002501630700006601655773009801721856008701819852000901906655001201915IND60635613820221119064732.0201202e20180601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063561382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2017.12.0892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKwan, Anya10aControlled release of flavor oil nanoemulsions encapsulated in filled soluble hydrogels  ap. 46-53.  aThe goal of this project was to create hydrogels, a type of soluble biopolymer delivery system to encapsulate flavored nanoemulsions that are released under artificial saliva conditions. Low methoxyl (LM) pectin and whey protein isolate (WPI) at pH 4.0 were used to form the hydrogels at a ratio of 4:1 (w/w), respectively. Orange oil, medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) oil, and WPI were used to make stable nanoemulsions loaded with flavor oil. The nanoemulsions were encapsulated into hydrogels with a mean diameter of 768 ± 36 nm. The ability of the hydrogels to encapsulate the orange oil and release the flavor in the presence of artificial saliva was determined using size distribution data, confocal microscopy, and the release of limonene as assessed by solid-phase microextraction using gas chromatography mass spectrometry. Results showed that the encapsulation of flavor nanoemulsions in filled hydrogels reduces the release of limonene.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiopolymers 3aconfocal microscopy 3aencapsulation 3aflavor 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3ahydrogels 3alimonene 3amedium chain triacylglycerols 3ananoemulsions 3aoils 3apH 3apectins 3asaliva 3asolid phase microextraction 3awhey protein isolate 0aFlavor nanoemulsions 0aEncapsulation 0aFilled hydrogels 0aSoluble complexes 0apH-dependent release1 aDavidov-Pardo, Gabriel1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4659-47780 tFood chemistry.g2018 June 01, v. 250 p.46-53dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2017.12.0893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01827naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002700144245013900171300001600310520052800326592002800854650001900882650002200901650001600923650002000939650001000959650001300969650001600982653001800998653001601016653001901032653001201051653001901063700002101082700001801103700002401121700002001145700002101165773013201186856007801318852000901396655001201405IND60643917620221122161319.0190514s2018    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064391762DNAL7 a10.1139/apnm-2017-06062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBeaudoin, Marie-Soleil10aRosiglitazone is superior to resveratrol in inducing the expression of glyceroneogenic genes in adipose tissue from obese participants  ap. 307-311.  aWe compared the effects of resveratrol and rosiglitazone, alone and in combination, on indices of fatty acid re-esterification in cultured adipose tissue from obese participants (n = 17) undergoing gastric bypass.

However, there have been few systematic studies on the fatigue bond behaviour between BFRP bars and SSSC. Therefore, to fully understand the fatigue bond mechanism of BFRP bar-reinforced SSSC structures, the fatigue bond performance between BFRP bars and SSSC was thoroughly studied. Fatigue pull-out tests were conducted to study the influence of the concrete strength, bar diameters, surface shapes of BFRP bars, and stress levels on the fatigue bond behaviour. It was found that the total slip could be regarded as an inherent property of the bond between BFRP bars and SSSC, which had nothing to do with the loading process. Furthermore, the bond fatigue failure mode had great influence on the fatigue bond indexes, including the fatigue bond stiffness, slip at maximum fatigue bond stress, and residual fatigue slip. A fatigue bond model was proposed to reflect the fatigue bond behaviour. Meanwhile, a design method was proposed for predicting the fatigue life based on the slip at maximum fatigue bond stress. Finally, according to different surface shapes of BFRP bars, the fatigue bond mechanism between BFRP bars and SSSC was classified and discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasalt 3acoastal zone management 3aconcrete 3amodels 3apolymers 3aseawater 0aFatigue behaviour 0aBFRP bars 0aBond 0aSeawater sea-sand concrete 0aFatigue life1 aMai, Guanghao1 aQiao, Sihua1 aHe, Shaohua1 aZhang, Baifa1 aWang, Hongliang1 aZhou, Keting1 aLi, Lijuan0 tOcean & coastal management.g2022 Mar. 01, v. 218 p.106038-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11975x0964-56917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2022.1060383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02691naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002100144245015200165300001800317500002000335520138900355592002801744650001601772650003501788650000901823650002201832650001101854650000901865650000901874650002501883650001501908650000701923650001401930650001601944700002001960700002001980700001802000700003002018773013402048856007802182852000902260655001202269IND60589126420221122190711.0180202e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058912642DNAL7 a10.1002/jssc.2017002112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCaslavska, Jitka10aAnalysis of genetic variants of transferrin in human serum after desialylation by capillary zone electrophoresis and capillary isoelectric focusing  ap. 2488-2497.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aCapillary electrophoresis analysis of transferrin in human serum is used to assess genetic variants after desialylation with neuraminidase and iron saturation to reduce the complexity of the transferrin pattern and thus facilitate the recognition of transferrin polymorphisms. Asialo‐transferrin forms are analyzed by capillary zone electrophoresis using assay conditions as for the monitoring of carbohydrate‐deficient transferrin or by capillary isoelectric focusing in a pH 5–8 gradient which requires immunoextraction of transferrin prior to analysis. With the carrier ampholytes used, peaks for iron saturated and iron depleted transferrin are monitored which indicates complexation of iron ions by carrier ampholytes. For BC, CD, and BD genetic variants, the expected peaks for B, C, and D forms of transferrin were detected with both methods. Monitoring of CC patterns revealed three cases, namely those producing double peaks in both methods, a double peak in capillary isoelectric focusing only and a double peak in capillary zone electrophoresis only. For all samples analyzed, data obtained by capillary isoelectric focusing could be confirmed with gel isoelectric focusing. The two capillary electrophoresis methods are shown to represent effective tools to assess unusual transferrin patterns, including genetic variants with dissimilar abundances of the two forms.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood serum 3acapillary zone electrophoresis 3agels 3agenetic variation 3ahumans 3aions 3airon 3aisoelectric focusing 3amonitoring 3apH 3asialidase 3atransferrin1 aLanz, Christian1 aBurda, Patricie1 aTobler, Micha1 aThormann, W.q(Wolfgang),0 tJournal of separation science.g2017 June, v. 40, no. 11 p.2488-2497dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3924049x1615-93067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jssc.2017002113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03036naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245017900155300002000334520162800354592002801982650002202010650002302032650001002055650001802065650001902083650001302102650001902115650002802134650001902162650001302181650002202194650001402216650002102230700001702251700001602268700001702284700001502301700001902316700002002335700001602355773012402371856007402495852000902569655001202578IND60666927420221122183941.0190919e20141027xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066692742DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra10407b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yinwen10aSynthesis and encapsulation of an amphiphilic thermoresponsive star polymer with β-cyclodextrin and hyperbranched poly(oligo(ethylene glycol)methacrylate) as building blocks  ap. 54268-54281.  aNovel macromolecular star polymers with triazole and cyclodextrin (CD) segments as branch points and poly(oligo(ethylene glycol)methacrylate) (POEGMAs) as dense hydrophilic branches were synthesized via a combination of azide–alkyne click chemistry and atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP). Firstly, a tetrafunctional linking agent (PETP) was prepared by the reaction of pentaerythritol (PE) and propargyl bromide, and then a four arm β-CD terminated star polymer (PE-CD) was obtained through the click chemistry reaction. Finally, thermally-responsive star polymers (PE-CD–POEGMAs) with PE as the central core, triazole and CD segments as branch points, and POEGMAs as side branches were synthesized by the ATRP of MEO₂MA and OEGMA using PE-CD terminated with bromines as macroinitiators. A study on the thermoresponsivity and morphology of PE-CD–POEGMAs indicated that polymeric nano-aggregates existed as multimolecular micelles and behaved with tunable thermosensitivity, which were driven by the strong hydrophobic–hydrophilic interactions in the inner core and outer shell. The encapsulation capacities towards multi-guest molecules were investigated and the results indicated that water soluble guests could be encapsulated by PE-CD–POEGMAs, and the guest encapsulation capacities were derived from the special star molecular structure properties of PE-CD–POEGMAs and the synergistic encapsulation phenomenon of different guest molecules. This unique amphiphilic star polymer illustrated the potential applications in supramolecular science, drug delivery and other nanotechnology applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeta-cyclodextrin 3achemical structure 3adrugs 3aencapsulation 3ahydrophilicity 3amicelles 3ananotechnology 3aorganobromine compounds 3apolymerization 3apolymers 3athermosensitivity 3atriazoles 3awater solubility1 aGuo, Huilong1 aZheng, Jian1 aGan, Jianqun1 aZhang, Yan1 aGuan, Xiaoxiao1 aWu, Kun,d1953-1 aLu, Mangeng0 tRSC advances.g2014 Oct. 27, v. 4, no. 97 p.54268-54281dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ra10407b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02894naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002300152245010100175300001600276520099000292592002801282650001901310650001701329650002501346650002601371650001401397650001301411650002201424650001101446650002001457650001001477650001301487650001901500650001101519650001501530650004301545650005201588650002601640650001401666650001101680650002901691653000801720653000801728653000801736653001001744653002301754653000901777653000801786653000801794653001201802653001101814653002201825653002801847653001801875653001401893653002201907653002301929700001901952700001901971700002301990773010002013856008602113852000902199655001202208IND60635614020221119064729.0190402e20180615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063561402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2017.12.0902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMitrová, Katarina10aAlliinase and cysteine synthase transcription in developing garlic (Allium sativum L.) over time  ap. 103-109.  aGarlic is a valuable source of healthy compounds, including secondary metabolites rich in sulphur such as cysteine sulphoxides (CSOs). Here, we present new qRT-PCR assays analysing the transcription of two genes encoding key enzymes in CSO biosynthetic pathways (cysteine synthase and alliinase) in developing garlic. We also identified a set of genes (ACT I, GAPDH, and TUB) to use as transcription normalisation controls. We showed that the (normalised) transcription of both enzymes was highest during sprouting and decreased significantly in fully developed leaves, which are the major CSO-producing organs. Transcriptional activity further declined at the end of the growing season. Different cultivars show similar sulphur metabolism gene expression when European garlics were compared to Chinese and American genotypes. The qRT-PCR assays presented are also suitable for investigating the effects of agricultural practices on CSO formation in garlic to satisfy consumer demands.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAllium sativum 3aalliin lyase 3abiochemical pathways 3aconsumer satisfaction 3acultivars 3acysteine 3acysteine synthase 3agarlic 3agene expression 3agenes 3agenotype 3agrowing season 3aleaves 3ametabolism 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asecondary metabolites 3asprouting 3asulfur 3atranscription (genetics) 0a18S 0aACT 0aCSO 0aCSase 0aO3-acetyl-L-serine 0aGAPD 0aTUB 0aUBQ 0aqRT-PCR 0aGarlic 0aAllium sativum L. 0aTranscription profiling 0aNormalisation 0aAlliinase 0aCysteine synthase 0aHousekeeping genes1 aSvoboda, Pavel1 aMilella, Luigi1 aOvesná, Jaroslava0 tFood chemistry.g2018 June 15, v. 251 p.103-109dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2017.12.0903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03708naa a2200805 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245016800172300001400340520155900354592002801913650003001941650003101971650001502002650001002017650001302027650001602040650004902056650002202105650001102127650002102138650001202159650001402171650001302185650001802198650001802216653000802234653000702242653000702249653001002256653000802266653001602274653000802290653000702298653001002305653000702315653001002322653000802332653000902340653000802349653000802357653000802365653000902373653000702382653000702389653001002396653000702406653001902413653001802432653003002450653001802480653002202498700001602520700001402536700001602550700002002566700001802586700001202604700002102616700002102637700002202658773011602680856008502796852000902881655001202890IND60584676120221118070353.0190215e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058467612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbabio.2017.10.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBadshah, Syed Lal10aMutations in algal and cyanobacterial Photosystem I that independently affect the yield of initial charge separation in the two electron transfer cofactor branches  ap. 42-55.  aIn Photosystem I, light-induced electron transfer can occur in either of two symmetry-related branches of cofactors, each of which is composed of a pair of chlorophylls (ec2A/ec3A or ec2B/ec3B) and a phylloquinone (PhQA or PhQB). The axial ligand to the central Mg2+ of the ec2A and ec2B chlorophylls is a water molecule that is also H-bonded to a nearby Asn residue. Here, we investigate the importance of this interaction for charge separation by converting each of the Asn residues to a Leu in the green alga, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, and the cyanobacterium, Synechocystis sp. PCC6803, and studying the energy and electron transfer using time-resolved optical and EPR spectroscopy. Nanosecond transient absorbance measurements of the PhQ to FX electron transfer show that in both species, the PsaA-N604L mutation (near ec2B) results in a ~50% reduction in the amount of electron transfer in the B-branch, while the PsaB-N591L mutation (near ec2A) results in a ~70% reduction in the amount of electron transfer in the A-branch. A diminished quantum yield of P700+PhQ− is also observed in ultrafast optical experiments, but the lower yield does not appear to be a consequence of charge recombination in the nanosecond or microsecond timescales. The most significant finding is that the yield of electron transfer in the unaffected branch did not increase to compensate for the lower yield in the affected branch. Hence, each branch of the reaction center appears to operate independently of the other in carrying out light-induced charge separation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChlamydomonas reinhardtii 3aSynechocystis sp.

Based on the ion optic focus mechanism, an electron impact ionization source was designed, and the electron entrance into the ionization chamber was designed with a hollow cylinder structure to improve the ion extraction efficiency. Numerical simulation and optimal geometry were optimized by SIMION 8.0 to provide higher electron intensity and ion transmission efficiency. To improve the electron intensity, the influence of the filament potential and magnetic intensity was investigated, and the values of 70 eV and 150 Gs were chosen in our apparatus. Based on the optimal parameters, the air in the lab and oxygen gas was detected by the homemade apparatus, and the ion intensity was detected in the positive and negative ion modes, respectively. The homemade electron impact ion source apparatus has the potential to enhance ionization efficiency applied in the mass spectrometer ionization source.  aPublisher supplied data  aYYWF201625cChinese Academy of Geological Sciences  a41603056cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2011YQ05006902cNational Major Scientific Instruments and Equipment Development Special Funds0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3ageometry 3aionization 3amathematical models 3aoxygen 3aspectrometers1 aTian, Di1 aGao, Guolun1 aLiu, Guangda1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8905-76411 aQiu, Chunling1 aLong, Tao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7213-49270 tJournal of Analytical Methods in Chemistry (Online).g2020 Jan. 25, v. 2020dHindawiwJournal:26807x2090-88737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2020/28094853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02124naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245010600153300002000259520111000279592002801389650001801417650002301435650001301458650001601471650002801487650002501515700001701540700001601557700001801573773012401591856007401715852000901789655001201798IND60667207420221119224224.0190919e20150121xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066720742DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra15785k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGang, A.10aMultifunctional reversibly sealable microfluidic devices for patterned material deposition approaches  ap. 11806-11811.  aWe present a concept to produce reversibly sealable polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) based microfluidic devices with versatile channel designs, withstanding pressures up to 600 kPa. A novel fabrication strategy, namely the casting of a secondary PDMS casing around the initial channel system allows diverting the tubing attached to the channels sideways so that a simple mounting assembly can be used to press the fluidic chip onto virtually any type of substrate. We demonstrate the functionalities of the developed setup at a proof-of-concept level by direct printing of electronic interconnects onto flexible substrates in a single step. As a second application, we generate uniquely shaped polymer structures when combining the presented technique with droplet microfluidics using a UV-curable adhesive and water as continuous and dispersed phases, respectively. We believe the developed approach has a plethora of applications and a clear perspective of being used for cost-efficient and multifunctional designs of novel classes of materials and devices in diverse areas from electronics to biotechnology.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiotechnology 3acost effectiveness 3adroplets 3aelectronics 3amicrofluidic technology 3apolydimethylsiloxane1 aHaustein, N.1 aBaraban, L.1 aCuniberti, G.0 tRSC advances.g2015 Jan. 21, v. 5, no. 16 p.11806-11811dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ra15785k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02492naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001400152245008500166300001400251520122300265592002801488650001301516650001101529650001901540650002001559650001401579650001301593650001301606650000901619650001201628650000901640650002301649650001401672650001101686650001001697650001601707653002001723653001201743653002401755653001301779700001701792700001901809773009901828856008601927852000902013655001202022IND60567145420221116231933.0170710e20170601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056714542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2016.04.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQuan, Cui10aSteam reforming of bio-oil from coconut shell pyrolysis over Fe/olivine catalyst  ap. 40-47.  aCatalytic steam reforming of coconut shell pyrolysis bio-oil over Fe/olivine catalyst was conducted in a fixed-bed quartz reactor. The effects of calcination temperature, iron loading, reaction temperature, steam to carbon ratio (S/C), bio-oil weight hourly space velocity (WbHSV) on gas composition and carbon conversion were investigated. The results indicate that Fe/olivine has good activity for steam reforming of bio-oil, the couple Fe2+/3+/Fe2+ may be sufficiently efficient for C–C, C–O and C–H breaking. After steam reforming, most of the phenolics in pyrolysis oil are converted into light molecular compounds such as H2, CO, CO2, and CH4. The H2 concentration and carbon conversion were enhanced by increasing reaction temperature from 750 to 800°C and the S/C from 1.5 to 2, but decreased with increasing calcination temperature. In the WbHSV range of 0.5–0.6, the hydrogen concentration decreased obviously, whereas it decreased slightly by further increasing WbHSV. The highest hydrogen concentration of 47.6vol% was obtained among the catalysts tested, and the best carbon conversion was 97.2% over 10% Fe/olivine catalyst under the reforming conditions of temperature=800°C, WbHSV=0.5, S/C=2.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiofuels 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon monoxide 3acatalysts 3acoconuts 3ahydrogen 3airon 3amethane 3aoils 3aphenolic compounds 3apyrolysis 3aquartz 3asteam 3atemperature 0aSteam reforming 0aBio-oil 0aFe/olivine catalyst 0aHydrogen1 aXu, Shaoping1 aZhou, Congcong0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2017 June 01, v. 141 p.40-47dElsevier Ltdx0196-89047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2016.04.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01862naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245003200168300001600200500001100216520079100227592002801018650001701046650001901063650002501082650002301107650001801130650001001148650001401158650001201172650001801184650002801202650000901230650001901239650001901258700001601277773008101293856008101374852000901455655001201464IND60586052320221122090323.0171115e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058605232DNAL7 a10.1007/s13237-017-0222-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhush, Gurdev S.10aAlien introgression in rice  ap. 251-261.  aReview  aCultivated rice, Oryza sativa has 22 wild species.

It is easy to transfer genes from these species to rice through standard hybridization procedures. However, various tissue culture and cytogenetic techniques are needed to transfer genes from distantly related species. Many important genes/QTLs for resistance to diseases and insects as well as tolerance to abiotic stresses have been transferred into rice from wild species. These genes provide yield stability of varieties. Thus usefulness of wild species germplasm in food security can hardly be over emphasized.

However, the landscape structural diversity and the cover of forest-grassland ecotones, which are both crucial for nature conservation value, were not explicitly considered.We aimed to compare the country-specific management guidelines regarding their efficiency for the conservation of the structurally diverse forest-grassland mosaics in the light of recent land-use and climate change.In strategic simulation experiments using the process-based model of pasture-woodland ecosystems WoodPaM, we analyzed the relationships among drivers for the formation of mosaic patterns (grazing intensity, climate change) and the resulting landscape properties (tree cover, forest-grassland ecotones, mosaic structure) during the past until today (2000 AD).The results showed that tree canopy densification following recent climate warming is likely to trigger landscape structural shifts. Medium grazing pressure promoted the development of the full range of pasture-woodland habitats and is therefore confirmed as a management strategy that balances agronomic demands and nature conservation value. Tree cover is rejected as a criteria to monitor pasture-woodland conservation status, because its relationship to landscape structural diversity and to the cover of forest-grassland ecotones did not hold for changing climate.Our results suggest “experimental-retrospective” analysis as a useful tool to test conclusions from expert knowledge.  aPublisher supplied data 3acanopy 3aclimate 3aconservation status 3aecosystems 3aecotones 3aexpert opinion 3aglobal warming 3agrazing intensity 3aguidelines 3ahabitats 3aland use 3alandscapes 3amodels 3atrees 3aRomania 3aSwitzerland 0aForest-grassland mosaic 0aForest-grassland ecotone 0aLow-intensity grazing 0aClimate change adapted management 0aSouthern Carpathians 0aJura Mountains1 aGillet, François,1 aRosenthal, Gert1 aStoicescu, Ioana1 aPătru-Stupariu, Ileana1 aStupariu, Mihai-Sorin1 aButtler, Alexandre0 tEcological modelling.g2016 June 24, v. 330 p.41-49dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl6191x0304-38007nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2016.03.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02789naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245017300170300001400343520125200357592002801609650000901637650002201646650001001668650001201678650001401690650001101704650001701715650001301732650002401745650000901769650001101778650003101789650001401820650001601834650003701850651001601887653001801903653003001921653002401951653001101975653000901986700001801995700002202013700002002035700002202055773009902077856008602176852000902262655001202271IND60567145620221120194710.0170710e20170601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056714562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2016.04.0832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNorouzi, Omid10aHydrothermal gasification performance of Enteromorpha intestinalis as an algal biomass for hydrogen-rich gas production using Ru promoted Fe–Ni/γ-Al2O3 nanocatalysts  ap. 63-71.  aSupercritical water gasification (SCWG) of Enteromorpha intestinalis (E. intestinalis) as a major algal biomass of southern coast of Caspian Sea was investigated in a batch reactor with and without the catalyst, to determine its potential for hydrogen production. The highest hydrogen yield of 5.25 (mmol H2/g of E. intestinalis) was observed for the noncatalytic test in the temperature of 440°C, water loading of 6g, E. intestinalis loading of 0.06g and reaction time of 10min. All catalytic tests were performed in this condition in the presence of unpromoted and ruthenium promoted Ni–Fe/γ-Al2O3 nanocatalysts. Catalysts were prepared with 12wt.% of Ni and 6wt.% of Fe in the active phase and 0.5–2wt.% of Ru as a promoter via microemulsion technique. Nanocatalysts were characterized by ICP, BET, XRD, H2 chemisorption, and TEM techniques to recognize their physicochemical properties. According to catalyst characterizations, the promoted Ni–Fe/γ-Al2O3 with 2wt.% Ru with higher dispersion and smaller size of nickel on γ-Al2O3, showed the best performance during SCWG of E. intestinalis. The maximum H2 yield of 12.28 (mmol H2/g of E. intestinalis) and hydrogen selectivity of 0.74, were obtained by using this optimized catalyst.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUlva 3aX-ray diffraction 3aalgae 3abiomass 3acatalysts 3acoasts 3agasification 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen production 3airon 3anickel 3aphysicochemical properties 3aruthenium 3atemperature 3atransmission electron microscopy 3aCaspian Sea 0aAlgal biomass 0aHydrothermal gasification 0aHydrogen production 0aNickel 0aIron1 aSafari, Farid1 aJafarian, Sajedeh1 aTavasoli, Ahmad1 aKarīmī, ʻAlī,0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2017 June 01, v. 141 p.63-71dElsevier Ltdx0196-89047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2016.04.0833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02996naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245015900162300001600321500002000337520177100357592002802128596002502156596003402181650001402215650002302229650001802252650001402270650000902284650001702293650001302310700002302323700002102346700001902367773015302386856007402539852000902613655001202622IND60782234720221123030556.0220706e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078223472DNAL7 a10.1111/jvp.130592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aClark, Terrence P.10aMulticentered masked placebo‐controlled phase 2 clinical study of an extended duration transdermal buprenorphine solution for postoperative pain in cats  ap.

One‐hundred fifteen (115) cats were randomized to a single topical dose of placebo solution, low‐TBS dosage (1.91–2.07 mg/kg) or high‐TBS dosage (4.27–4.88 mg/kg) prior to surgical reproductive sterilization in conjunction with forelimb onychectomy. The low‐ and high‐TBS doses were applied 2–4 and 1–2 hours prior to surgery. Interactive pain assessments and physiological variables were quantified through 96 hours post‐anesthetic recovery and rescue analgesia was administered any time that analgesia was considered inadequate. Cats requiring rescue analgesia were considered treatment failures. The estimated overall treatment success rates from generalized linear mixed effects model analysis were 0.10 (95% CI: [0.02–0.36]), 0.56 (95% CI: [0.25–0.83]), 0.71 (95% CI: [0.38–0.91]) in the placebo‐, low‐, and high‐TBS dose groups, respectively. Success rates for both TBS treatment groups were superior to placebo. Adverse events were infrequent in all treatment groups although the postoperative body temperatures over the duration of the study were on average 0.31 (95% CI: [0.08–0.55]) and 0.30 (95% CI: [0.05–0.53]) °C higher in low‐ and high‐TBS dose cats, respectively, compared to placebo. It is concluded that both the low‐ and high‐TBS dosages were safe and effective. The high‐TBS dosage resulted in a greater proportion of treatment successes over 96 h, had a more acceptable preoperative application time of 1–2 h prior to surgery, and was therefore selected for further study.  aPublisher supplied data  cElanco Animal Health  cNexcyon Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 3aanalgesia 3aapplication timing 3abuprenorphine 3adeclawing 3apain 3apharmacology 3aplacebos1 aLinton, Deborah D.1 aFreise, Kevin J.1 aLin, Ting‐Li0 tJournal of veterinary pharmacology and therapeutics.g2022 July, v. 45 Suppl S1 p.S40-S51dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl51172x0140-77837nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jvp.130593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03021naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002500148245014200173300002000315500001900335520156200354592002801916596013501944650001102079650001202090650001902102650002202121650002502143650001102168650002602179650001402205650002902219650001302248650002502261700005502286700002002341773017002361856008302531852000902614655001202623IND60706988420221118042132.0200819e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070698842DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-020-09263-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVasichenko, Kristina10aSymmetric and asymmetric effect of energy consumption and CO2 intensity on environmental quality: using nonlinear and asymmetric approach  ap. 32809-32819.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis paper investigates the asymmetric impact of energy consumption and carbon dioxide (CO₂) intensity on the environmental quality in Russia. The ecological footprint (a proxy for environmental quality) was used as a dependent variable, while independent variables include energy consumption, CO₂ intensity, and gross fixed capital formation as a proxy of capital for time series data spanning from 1992 to 2016. To examine the asymmetric cointegration between the selected variables, the nonlinear autoregressive distributed lag (NARDL) method was used. The structural break unit root and BDS tests were used to check data stationarity and nonlinearity, respectively. Besides, the asymmetric causality test in Gauss software was employed to check the causal relationship among the variables. Among the considered variables, the asymmetric cointegration was found. A significant unidirectional symmetric causality was found running from energy consumption to ecological footprint (Wald test = 3.956*) and from ecological footprint to capital (Wald test = 10.115**), while asymmetrically, ecological footprint granger cause energy consumption (Wald test = 6.054**) and capital (Wald test = 6.739**) respectively. On the contrary, a neutral effect was found between environmental quality and CO₂ intensity. From these findings, environmental policies are also discussed. Specifically, policymakers should support modern, controlled emission technologies, including nuclear and renewable energy sources and green portfolio investment.

One way to monitor elephant populations to estimate a sustainable carrying capacity is through the use of standing-crop carrying-capacity models. Previous carrying-capacity models designed for grazers have posed issues when applied to browsers such as elephants, predicting much higher carrying-capacity estimates than are realized in nature. This might be attributed to the level of plant secondary metabolites, which limit the available nitrogen in browse material that browsers and mixed feeders encounter while foraging. Many browsers and mixed-feeders, including elephants, have a physiological mechanism to tolerate a portion of encountered tannins in the form of salivary tannin-binding proteins. We constructed an optimal-foraging model for carrying capacity for elephants that incorporates the negative effects of plant secondary metabolites and the partial neutralization of these chemicals by the tannin-binding affinity of elephant saliva. In addition, our model includes diet breadth and dietary contribution of browsed species, browse quality, and the available standing crop of browsed species. Ultimately, our model produced more plausible estimates of elephant carrying capacity when compared with estimates that use 100% nitrogen availability and use. Moreover, as the key variables needed for the model can be obtained easily, our model is not site-specific or limited to elephants, but rather can be applied to a wide range of browsing herbivores across a number of reserves of different sizes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aElephantidae 3aadverse effects 3abrowsing 3acarrying capacity 3adiet 3aforaging 3aherbivores 3amodels 3aneutralization 3anitrogen 3aprediction 3aproteins 3asaliva 3asecondary metabolites 3atannins 0aLoxodonta africana 0aPreferred species 0aPrincipal species 0aTannins1 aWard, David1 aShrader, Adrian M.0 tEcological modelling.g2016 July 24, v. 332 p.8-18dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl6191x0304-38007nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2016.03.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01826naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245007000161300001400231520065000245592002800895650002300923650002200946650001000968650002600978651001001004653001301014653001301027653001301040653001601053653001501069653001901084653002501103653001701128653001801145653002001163700001901183700001701202773009301219856008301312852000901395655001201404IND60479386420221122234844.0160121e20000701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047938642DNAL7 a10.1556/ComEc.1.2000.1.112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, S.

The simulation uses enumeration data of trees, and derived variables such as species richness, species importance, and species population density, to compare the efficiency of the sampling. The results verify that greater sampling efficiency is to be expected using systematic sampling than random sampling.

Bypassing the first kinase step to nucleoside monophosphate is viewed as advantageous since this phosphorylation is often observed as the rate-limiting transformation to the active NTP for many nucleosides. Efficient synthetic routes were developed with a triphenylphosphine–iodine cyclization reaction as the key step to form the tetrahydrofuran 4′-spirocycle. The desired 4′-spirocyclic phosphono-cytidine analogs 12a, 12b, and 16 were prepared in 11 steps.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHepatitis C virus 3aantiviral agents 3achemical structure 3acyclization reactions 3anucleosides 3aphosphorylation 3atetrahydrofuran 0aNucleoside 0a4′-Spirocyclic phosphonate 0aNucleoside-monophosphate mimic 0aHCV NS5B inhibitor1 aZhang, Zhibo1 aHe, Shuangsheng1 aLiu, Yaohong1 aChen, Tongqian1 aBogen, Stephane1 aGirijavallabhan, Vinay1 aOlsen, David B.1 aMeinke, Peter T.0 tTetrahedron letters.g2014 July 30, v. 55, no. 31 p.4407-4409dElsevier LtdwJournal:11745x0040-40397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tetlet.2014.06.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02630naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245009100165300001800256500001900274520118800293536022701481592002801708596006501736650002601801650001501827650001101842650002201853650001601875650001501891650002201906650002101928653003101949653001101980700001801991773014102009856008502150852000902235655001202244IND60676938220221118162412.0191122e20191110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067693822DNAL7 a10.1080/15226514.2019.15668782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yu10aUptake, accumulation and phytoextraction efficiency of cesium in Gypsophila paniculata  ap. 1290-1295.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aTo evaluate the phytoextraction efficiency of Gypsophila paniculata from Cs-contaminated soils and analyze the mechanism of Cs accumulation in G. paniculata, we analyzed the characteristics of Cs bioaccumulation and subcellular distribution, in addition to its chemical forms in the plant under hydroponic conditions. The results showed that total Cs content in the aboveground parts and the entire plant were as high as 6137.32 mg·kg⁻¹ dry weight and 7338.49 mg·kg⁻¹ dry weight, respectively, after 17 days in the 50 mg·L⁻¹ Cs treatment. The BCF was between 2.35 and 3.38. The TF was between 1.00 and 2.46 in G. paniculata. Subcellular distribution of Cs in the plant was as follows: soluble fraction > cell wall > organelles. Inorganic Cs (F-ethanol) and water-soluble Cs (F-dH2O) were the main types of Cs in G. paniculata. Further studies show that the phytoextraction efficiency can reach 10.30–11.91% planting a season of G. paniculata under potted conditions. The results suggested that G. paniculata, a perennial, drought-tolerant herb, was a high-accumulator of Cs, which may have potential uses in phytoremediation of Cs-contaminated soil.  aThis study was financially supported by National Defense Basic Scientific Research Project of China [No. JCKY2016404C002].

In the present study, we developed an Indium Phosphide (InP) semiconductor-based resistive biosensor using the change of its electronic properties upon biomaterial adsorption as sensing element. To detect biomaterial at low concentrations, the procedure of functionalization and covalent biomolecule immobilization was also optimized to guarantee high molecule density and high reproducibility which are prerequisite for reliable results. The characterization, such as biomolecular conjugation efficiency, detection concentration limits, receptor:ligand specificity and concentration detection range was analyzed by using three different biological systems: i) synthetic dsDNA and two phytopathogenic diseases, ii) the severe CB-form of Citrus Tristeza Virus (CTV) and iii) Xylella fastidiosa, both causing great economic loss worldwide. The experimental results show a sensitivity of 1pM for specific ssDNA detection and about 2nM for the specific detection of surface proteins of CTV and X. fastidiosa phytopathogens. A brief comparison with other semiconductor based biosensors and other methodological approaches is discussed and confirms the high sensitivity and reproducibility of our InP based biosensor which could be suitable for reliable early infection diagnosis in environmental and life sciences.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCitrus tristeza virus 3aXylella fastidiosa 3aadsorption 3abiomedical research 3abiosensors 3adiagnostic techniques 3aenvironmental science 3afinancial economics 3aindium 3aplant pathogens 3asemiconductors 3asingle-stranded DNA 3asurface proteins1 aJanissen, Richard1 aSantos, Clelton A.1 aPeroni, Luis A.1 aStach-Machado, Dagmar R.1 ade Souza, Alessandra A.1 ade Souza, Anete P.1 aCotta, Mônica A.0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2012 , v. 36, no. 1 p.62-68dElsevier B.V.x0956-56637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2012.03.0383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04126naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006500148245015900213300001800372520253700390592002802927596013902955596004303094650002003137650002403157650002403181650001203205650001603217650001403233650001203247650001403259650001003273650002303283650001103306650001903317650002003336650001003356650000903366651001203375700002803387700002503415773013603440856008303576852000903659655001203668IND60769034020221122040736.0220301e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076903402DNAL7 a10.1007/s10722-022-01349-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFaluyi, Julius Olaoye1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7478-707810aCollection, characterizaton, product quality evaluation, and conservation of genetic resources of yam (Dioscorea spp.) cultivars from Ekiti State, Nigeria  ap. 1419-1437.  aThis study was initiated to assess the damage done to the genetic resources of yam in a core yam-producing community in Ekiti State, Southwestern Nigeria and embark on restoration through exploration, collection, identification and conservation of lost cultivars. Twenty cultivars, consisting of Dioscorea rotundata Poir, D. cayenensis Lam., D. alata L., and D. dumetorum (Kunth) Pax were identified, collected, characterized and multiplied using an On-farm Participatory Method. The yam cultivars were characterized for quality and yield of pounded yam (iyan) as well as starch properties. They were later conserved in the Teaching and Research Farm of the Obafemi Awolowo University Ile-Ife. Morphological characterization separated Dioscorea alata (Ewura cultivar) by its winged vines while Dioscorea dumetorum (Esuru cultivar) was separated by its pubescent spines, trifoliate leaf with acute apex and base and the clustered, irregularly-shaped tuber. All the cultivars were rated good in their quality of pounded yam but Ikumo Ajimokun, and Odo cultivars were rated best and this was attributed to the swelling properties and amylose contents of their starch. A key for the identification of the cultivars based on morphological characteristics of the vine, leaf and tuber and their appendages was constructed. Multiple vines was found to be about 50% in occurrence among the cultivars. It is a valuable agrobotanical character which conditions multiple tubers and can ensure the survival of at least one vine per hill in the event of drought. Multiple tubers from single vines were also observed in Ajimokun, Gbongi, and Gaungaun cultivars. Yam cultivars with high granules had low swelling capacities. The Brittle Fraction Indices of the starch from all the cultivars was lower than 1.0 explaining why the iyan they produced had no crust on the surface and kept for long hours after preparation. From this study, it was concluded that the local yam cultivars collected represent the core of yam genetic resources for utilization in the region. These cultivars are therefore recommended for prioritization in further studies on propagation, conservation and improvement so that a narrow genetic base of cultivars is not encouraged, for example, by promoting cultivars whose vines perform well in tuberization. The network of local yam farmers, yam sellers, researchers and enthusiasts used for this project is still working together for the recovery of more cultivars, particularly those that are probably close to being lost.  aPublisher supplied data  aYear 2015-2016 (Merged) Tertiary Education Trust Fund (TETFUND) Research Projects (RP)/IBR InterventioncTertiary Education Trust Fund  aBatch 7cTertiary Education Trust Fund 3aDioscorea alata 3aDioscorea dumetorum 3aDioscorea rotundata 3aamylose 3abrittleness 3acultivars 3adrought 3aevolution 3afarms 3agenetic background 3aleaves 3aprioritization 3aproduct quality 3avines 3ayams 3aNigeria1 aMatthew, Joshua Olumide1 aAzeez, Sekinat Okiki0 tGenetic resources and crop evolution.g2022 Apr., v. 69, no. 4 p.1419-1437dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl49569x0925-98647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10722-022-01349-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02420naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100002200148245007600170300001600246500001900262520114300281592002801424650002301452650001601475650001401491650002301505650001401528650002301542650001901565650001601584650002601600650001501626650001501641650001101656650001701667650002101684650001201705650001701717700001601734700001901750773011201769856008401881852000901965655001201974IND6036861620221122042608.0141112e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND603686162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.plaphy.2010.12.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAshihara, Hiroshi10aNicotinamide metabolism in ferns: Formation of nicotinic acid glucoside  ap. 275-279.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe metabolic fate of [carbonyl-¹⁴C]nicotinamide was investigated in 9 fern species, Psilotum nudum, Angiopteris evecta, Lygodium japonicum, Acrostichum aureum, Asplenium antiquum, Diplazium subsinuatum, Thelypteris acuminate, Blechnum orientale and Crytomium fortune. All fern species produce a large quantity of nicotinic acid glucoside from [¹⁴C]nicotinamide, but trigonelline formation is very low. Increases in the release of ¹⁴CO₂ with incubation time was accompanied by decreases in [carboxyl-¹⁴C]nicotinic acid glucoside. There was slight stimulation of nicotinic acid glucoside formation by 250 mM NaCl in mature leaves of the mangrove fern, Acrostichum aureum, but it is unlikely that this compound acts as a compatible solute. Nicotinamide and nicotinic acid salvage for pyridine nucleotide synthesis was detected in all fern species, although this activity was always less than nicotinic acid glucoside synthesis. Predominant formation of nicotinic acid glucoside is characteristic of nicotinic acid metabolism in ferns. This reaction appears to act as a detoxication mechanism, removing excess nicotinic acid.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcrostichum aureum 3aAngiopteris 3aAsplenium 3aBlechnum orientale 3aDiplazium 3aLygodium japonicum 3aPsilotum nudum 3aThelypteris 3aferns and fern allies 3aglucosides 3ametabolism 3aniacin 3anicotinamide 3aplant physiology 3asolutes 3atrigonelline1 aYin, Yuling1 aWatanabe, Shin0 tPlant physiology and biochemistry.g2011 Mar., v. 49, no. 3 p.275-279dElsevier Masson SASx0981-94287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plaphy.2010.12.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03823naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024003000127040001800157100005600175245012400231300001800355520181500373592002802188596007802216596006602294596008302360596004402443596005802487650001202545650001302557650002202570650002302592650001202615650001402627650002302641650001302664650002102677650002502698650002102723650001102744650001102755650001702766650001802783650002102801650001102822650001302833650001102846700002202857700005702879700002802936700006102964773014603025856007703171852000903248655001203257IND60684931120221122115021.0200226e20200204xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068493112DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.0c001992chorus7 a10.1021/jacs.0c001992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Yuting1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8751-968610aMultiple Mechanisms Mapped in Aryl Alkyl Ether Cleavage via Aqueous Electrocatalytic Hydrogenation over Skeletal Nickel  ap. 4037-4050.  aWe present here detailed mechanistic studies of electrocatalytic hydrogenation (ECH) in aqueous solution over skeletal nickel cathodes to probe the various paths of reductive catalytic C–O bond cleavage among functionalized aryl ethers relevant to energy science. Heterogeneous catalytic hydrogenolysis of aryl ethers is important both in hydrodeoxygenation of fossil fuels and in upgrading of lignin from biomass. The presence or absence of simple functionalities such as carbonyl, hydroxyl, methyl, or methoxyl groups is known to cause dramatic shifts in reactivity and cleavage selectivity between sp³ C–O and sp² C–O bonds. Specifically, reported hydrogenolysis studies with Ni and other catalysts have hinted at different cleavage mechanisms for the C–O ether bonds in α-keto and α-hydroxy β-O-4 type aryl ether linkages of lignin. Our new rate, selectivity, and isotopic labeling results from ECH reactions confirm that these aryl ethers undergo C–O cleavage via distinct paths. For the simple 2-phenoxy-1-phenylethane or its alcohol congener, 2-phenoxy-1-phenylethanol, the benzylic site is activated via Ni C–H insertion, followed by beta elimination of the phenoxide leaving group. But in the case of the ketone, 2-phenoxyacetophenone, the polarized carbonyl π system apparently binds directly with the electron rich Ni cathode surface without breaking the aromaticity of the neighboring phenyl ring, leading to rapid cleavage. Substituent steric and electronic perturbations across a broad range of β-O-4 type ethers create a hierarchy of cleavage rates that supports these mechanistic ideas while offering guidance to allow rational design of the catalytic method. On the basis of the new insights, the usage of cosolvent acetone is shown to enable control of product selectivity.  aPublisher supplied data  cBiological and Environmental Researchdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100006206  cMichigan State Universitydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100007709  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100005825  cNSFdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000001  cOffice of Sciencedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100006132 3aacetone 3aalcohols 3aaqueous solutions 3aaromatic compounds 3abiomass 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acathodes 3achemical bonding 3acleavage (chemistry) 3aelectrochemistry 3aenergy 3aethers 3afossil fuels 3ahydrogenation 3aisotope labeling 3alignin 3amoieties 3anickel1 aKlinger, Grace E.1 aHegg, Eric L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2055-54951 aSaffron, Christopher M.1 aJackson, James E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4506-74150 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2020 Feb. 04, v. 142, no. 8 p.4037-4050dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.0c001993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03156naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245010000172520174200272592002802014650002802042650001802070650002402088650002402112650000902136650002402145650001602169650001602185650001102201650002202212650001502234650001402249650001402263650002102277650001302298650001702311650001502328653002802343653001302371653001402384653002202398653001602420700002502436773012102461856008302582852000902665655001202674IND60727709920221118002222.0210619e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072770992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cbpc.2021.1089942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWongchum, Nattapong10aXanthohumol prolongs lifespan and decreases stress-induced mortality in Drosophila melanogaster  aAging is a significant risk factor that links to the genesis of human diseases. The capacity to scavenge free radicals and adapt to various stresses is essential for expanding living organisms' lifespan. The evidences on the promotion of longevity by dietary supplementation are growing. Drosophila or fruit fly is one of the most effective models for the evaluation of anti-aging compounds. Xanthohumol (XN) is a potential bioactive substance for the prevention and treatment of many diseases. The previous studies have reported its potent activities as antioxidant, anticancer, anti-inflammatory, antiviral, antibacterial antiplasmodial, and antiobesity. In this study, the effect of XN supplementation on the lifespan extension was investigated in Drosophila melanogaster. The effects of XN on the improvement of the recovery from cold and heat shock, the resistance to starvation stress, and free radical-induced oxidative stress in XN-treated flies were also evaluated. Results showed that supplementation with XN at 0.5 mg/mL diet extended the mean lifespan by 14.89%. This was consistent with a significant improvement of locomotor activity of the Drosophila fed with an XN-mixed diet compared with those fed with a control diet. XN supplementation significantly increased the antioxidant enzyme activities at both 25 and 40 days. Drosophila treated with XN exhibited increased survival after exposure to hydrogen peroxide and paraquat. Finally, XN supplementation improved the recovery from cold and heat shock, the resistance to starvation stress, and acetic acid-induced stress. The present study shows that dietary supplementation with XN revealed the longevity effect and ameliorated stress-induced mortality in Drosophila.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3aantimalarials 3aantioxidant enzymes 3abioactive compounds 3acold 3adietary supplements 3afruit flies 3aheat stress 3ahumans 3ahydrogen peroxide 3alocomotion 3alongevity 3amortality 3aoxidative stress 3aparaquat 3arisk factors 3astarvation 0aDrosophila melanogaster 0aLifespan 0aLongevity 0aStress resistance 0aXanthohumol1 aDechakhamphu, Ananya0 tComparative biochemistry and physiology.g2021 June, v. 244 p.108994-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12414x1532-04567nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cbpc.2021.1089943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03087naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245017100165300001100336520140600347592002801753596012401781596008101905596006301986650002002049650000802069650001802077650002902095650002302124650001402147650002202161650002402183650002602207650001902233650002502252650001702277650001202294650001002306651001002316700001802326700001502344700002002359700001202379773012202391856008302513852000902596655001202605IND60744910320221119210616.0210811e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074491032DNAL7 a10.1007/s00606-021-01774-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCai, Chaonan10aGenetic diversity of Horsfieldia tetratepala (Myristicaceae), an endangered Plant Species with Extremely Small Populations to China: implications for its conservation  ap. 50.  aGenetic variation determines the evolutionary potential of a species and is vital for fully understanding the evolution of a species, as well as for developing optimal conservation strategies. Horsfieldia tetratepala is classified as a Plant Species with Extremely Small Populations (PSESP) in China where it is an economically important rainforest tree, but it has declined sharply, mainly caused by habitat destruction and is now an endangered, narrow endemic. Effective conservation strategies for H. tetratepala are required urgently, but limited information exists about its genetic diversity. Accordingly, restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq) was used to sequence sixty-three H. tetratepala trees covering ten isolated populations to assess genomic diversity and population structure. The survey generated 8103 high-quality SNPs, analysis of which revealed low genetic diversity and moderate genetic differentiation among populations. However, Bayesian clustering of the sampled H. tetratepala populations produced two genetic clusters, though with some populations from Guangxi and Yunnan intermixed. Because of the increase in habitat fragmentation and human disturbance, conservation priority should be placed on populations with higher genetic variation (e.g., BB, TKH, DWS, and GLQ), allowing the formulation of more effective conservation strategies for this PSESP species.  aPublisher supplied data  a2017FY100100cSurvey and Germplasm Conservation of Plant Species with Extremely Small Populations in South‐west China  aZSSD‐013cBiodiversity Conservation Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences  a2017XTBG‐T03c135 Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences 3aBayesian theory 3aDNA 3aMyristicaceae 3aanthropogenic activities 3aendangered species 3aevolution 3agenetic variation 3ahabitat destruction 3ahabitat fragmentation 3aplant taxonomy 3apopulation structure 3arain forests 3asurveys 3atrees 3aChina1 aXiao, Jianhua1 aCi, Xiuqin1 aConran, John G.1 aLi, Jie0 tPlant systematics and evolution.g2021 Aug., v. 307, no. 4 p.50-50dSpringer ViennawJournal:jnl6813x0378-26977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00606-021-01774-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02573naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002300152245011200175520122500287592002801512650002301540650005001563650001001613650001301623650001201636650001901648650001001667650001001677650001201687650002601699650003601725650002001761650001701781650001701798700001801815700001801833700002101851700002201872700002101894773012801915856008702043852000902130655001202139IND60771359520221120213921.0220325e20220317xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077135952DNAL7 a10.3390/microorganisms100306352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChaudhari, Armi M.10aCRISPR-Cas9 Mediated Knockout of SagD Gene for Overexpression of Streptokinase in Streptococcus equisimilis  aStreptokinase is an enzyme that can break down the blood clots in some cases of myocardial infarction (heart attack), pulmonary embolism, and arterial thromboembolism. Demand for streptokinase is higher globally than production due to increased incidences of various heart conditions. The main source of streptokinase is various strains of Streptococci. Expression of streptokinase in native strain Streptococcus equisimilis is limited due to the SagD gene-mediated post-translational modification of streptolysin, an inhibitor of streptokinase expression through the degradation of FasX small RNA (through CoV/RS), which stabilizes streptokinase mRNA. In order to improve the stability of mRNA and increase the expression of streptokinase, which is inhibited by SagA, we used CRISPR-Cas9 to successfully knockout the SagD gene and observed a 13.58-fold increased expression of streptokinase at the transcript level and 1.48-fold higher expression at the protein level in the mutant strain compared to wild type. We have demonstrated the successful gene knockout of SagD using CRISPR-Cas9 in S. equisimilis, where an engineered strain can be further used for overexpression of streptokinase for therapeutic applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCRISPR-Cas systems 3aStreptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis 3ablood 3aembolism 3aenzymes 3agene targeting 3agenes 3aheart 3amutants 3amyocardial infarction 3apost-translational modification 3aprotein content 3astreptolysin 3atherapeutics1 aVyas, Sachin 1 aSingh, Vijai 1 aPatel, Amrutlal 1 aJoshi, Chaitanya 1 aJoshi, Madhvi N.0 tMicroorganisms.g2022 Mar. 17, v. 10, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27145x2076-26077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms100306353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03006naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002100142245011200163300001600275520163900291592002801930650000801958650001101966650002401977650001602001650002402017650001002041650001602051650001502067650001402082650003302096650001802129650001102147650003002158650001202188650001202200653001202212653003102224653001502255653002302270700002102293773014902314856007602463852000902539655001202548IND60696485620221123014053.0200527e20200523xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069648562DNAL7 a10.1660/062.123.01132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaricle, Keri L.10aPhylogenetic Distribution of DMV-D10, an Endogenous Strain of Dahlia Mosaic Virus, in Members of Asteraceae  ap. 165-177.  aDMV-D10 is a strain of Dahlia mosaic virus (DMV) that is classified as an endogenous virus and does not induce any visible symptoms in the host plant. Endogenous viruses have the ability to integrate their viral sequences into the host plant genome, which can be transmitted to offspring. No studies have examined the host range of DMV-D10 outside of the Dahlia genus. Because DMV-D10 has only been observed in Dahlia, the objective for this study was to determine if presence of DMV-D10 follows an evolutionary relationship among species closely related to Dahlia. An addition objective of this study was to determine if species infected with DMV-D10 may also be infected with Dahlia common mosaic virus (DCMV) because these plant viruses are closely related. It was hypothesized species in the same tribe (Coreopsideae) as Dahlia were more likely to be infected with DMV-D10 compared to species in other Asteraceae tribes. Ten tribes consisting of thirty-five species were collected, and DNA was extracted to determine DMV-D10 infection. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) results for a movement protein gene indicate DMV-D10 is widely spread across Asteraceae. Specifically, gel electrophoresis results suggest presence of DMV-D10 in thirteen species across seven tribes. Additionally, DCMV was detected in six species across five tribes of Asteraceae. Although, phylogenetic relationship of host plants does not necessarily determine DMV-D10 infection. This leads to questions of how this virus can move to species in other Asteraceae tribes. Some potential hypotheses include pollen transmission or possible plant-virus coevolution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDahlia 3aDahlia mosaic virus 3acoevolution 3agel electrophoresis 3agenes 3ahost plants 3ahost range 3aphylogeny 3aplant diseases and disorders 3aplant viruses 3apollen 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aprogeny 3aviruses 0aDMV-D10 0aDahlia common mosaic virus 0aAsteraceae 0aviral transmission1 aGillock, Eric T.0 tTransactions of the Kansas Academy of Science.g2020 May 23, v. 123, no. 1-2 p.165-177dKansas Academy of SciencewJournal:6278x0022-84437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1660/062.123.01133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02857naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245011100168520171000279592002801989650002502017650002402042650001102066650001802077650002002095653000902115653001902124653002102143653001102164653001202175653001702187700001902204700002402223700002002247700001602267773009502283856008402378852000902462655001202471IND60674173220221116192250.0191231e20200201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067417322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.appet.2019.1044922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuomala, Harri10aGet some respect – buy organic foods! When everyday consumer choices serve as prosocial status signaling  aStatus considerations have recently been linked to prosocial behaviors. This research shows that even everyday consumer behaviors such as favoring organic foods serve as prosocial status signaling. Key ideas from the continuum model of consumer impression formation and the theories of costly signaling and symbolic consumption are synthetized to make sense of this phenomenon. Two web-surveys (Ns = 187, 259) and a field study (N = 336) following experimental designs are conducted. This approach allows the analysis of both the more and less conscious reactions of consumers. Study 1 shows that the image of consumers favoring organic product versions is marked by characteristics consistent with prosocial status signaling. Study 2 replicates these findings with another sample and a wider range of products and demonstrate that observers’ conservative values influence the image formed of organic food users. Study 3 establishes that similar image effects also emerge through a less conscious formation process and that they extend to how organic food users are socially treated. This research advances the current understanding concerning the interlinkages between organic food usage, prosocial status signaling, consumer impressions and reputation management. Substantively, the studies provide novel compelling empirical evidence for the ability of non-luxurious everyday consumer behaviors to qualify as prosocial status signaling. Conceptually, the integration of evolutionary and sociocultural perspectives represents a major contribution. More specifically, this research yields new understanding as regards the role of individual variation in sensing and interpreting status symbols.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconsumer preferences 3aexperimental design 3amodels 3aorganic foods 3asocial behavior 0aFood 0aConsumer image 0aCostly signaling 0aStatus 0aOrganic 0aProsociality1 aPuska, Petteri1 aLähdesmäki, Merja1 aSiltaoja, Marjo1 aKurki, Sami0 tAppetite.g2020 Feb. 01, v. 145 p.104492-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl31756x0195-66637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2019.1044923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03276naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245011100169520204800280592002802328650001702356650001402373650001602387650001402403650001602417650001202433650000902445650001002454650001002464653002202474653001602496653003002512653000802542653000902550653001102559653000802570700002702578700002002605700002002625773010402645856008402749852000902833655001202842IND60776788620221119092038.0220531e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077678862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cageo.2022.1051252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJaspreet Singh,10aModified block shape characterization method for classification of fractured rock: A python-based GUI tool  aThe presence of discontinuities in fractured rocks contributes to the formation of blocks. Characterizing the size and shape of the congregation of blocks in the rock mass provides a comprehensive understanding for studying its engineering properties. The existing block shape characterization method (BSCM) considers two factors: α describes the shortening of the minor principal axis of the block, and β describes the elongation of the major axis. The parameter β used the average angular relation between the chords greater than the median, considering the average angle could produce skewed results towards elongated blocks. This study proposed a modified block shape classification method (MBSCM), where parameter β is provided with a new definition and procedure for calculation. To reckon the elongation index (β) of the block, the maximum angular extension between the chords was considered and the parameter α remained unchanged in the modified approach. The developed method was validated with synthetic rock masses of known shapes (i.e., cubic, elongated, elongated platy) constructed in the 3DEC (Three-dimensional distinct element code). Two case studies were also conducted on the Himalayan slopes to demonstrate the new method's applicability. Discrete Fracture Network (DFN) were generated for both the slopes to find the block related data formed by the intersection of the fracture network. The results show that the first slope was dominated with elongated (73.52%), elongated platy (16.53%) and platy (6.1%) blocks while the second slope was composed of elongated (59.17%), cubic elongated/platy (22.3/11.98%) and cubic (4.21%) blocks. The slopes were also classified using the existing method to compare the outcomes. The result shows that the existing method categorized about 5% more elongated blocks as compared to the proposed modified approach. A python-based GUI tool was developed for the modified approach and was successfully used to directly plot the classification diagrams by importing the raw data file.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3acomputers 3aengineering 3aengineers 3aexhibitions 3aimports 3amass 3arocks 3ashape 0aJointed rock mass 0aBlock shape 0aDiscrete fracture network 0aPFC 0a3DEC 0aPython 0aGUI1 aPradhan, Sarada Prasad1 aSingh, Mahendra1 aYuan, Bingxiang0 tComputers & geosciences.g2022 July, v. 164 p.105125-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12438x0098-30047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cageo.2022.1051253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02980naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006400148245005600212300001800268520174900286592002802035650002102063650001202084650000902096650001002105650001502115650002202130650002502152650001402177650002102191650000902212650001302221700002802234700002002262700002102282700002402303700001902327773013302346856008202479852000902561655001202570IND60744910520221119210643.0210721e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074491052DNAL7 a10.1007/s10530-021-02512-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarbraud, Christophe1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0146-212X10aPredation by feral cats threatens great albatrosses  ap. 2389-2405.  aFeral cats (Felis catus) are a potential threat for several seabird species including medium sized albatrosses, but studies documenting predation behavior, demographic impacts and effects of predator control are scarce. Here, we present data on feral cat predation behavior on one of the world’s largest seabirds, the wandering albatross (Diomedea exulans) at Kerguelen Island, and show how it affects breeding success and rate of population growth. We assess the effect of a feral cat control experiment on breeding success and population viability. Using 32 camera traps we monitored 25 nests of albatross and detected 295 events showing a potential predator. Of these, 75.2% and 24.8% involved feral cats and giant petrels, respectively. Giant petrels were never implicated in direct predation. We recorded 17 attacks of feral cats on 13 albatross chicks. Attacks lasted in average 52.1 ± 72.9 min, and resulted in the death of 10 of the 13 (76.9%) monitored chicks. Breeding success where attacks were recorded was low (12%) compared to areas with no attack (86%). Mean breeding success during 3 years before cat control was 26% and increased to 80% during the 3 years following the experiment. According to predation scenarios, population modelling showed that the albatross population would decline by 2.7–4.5% per year without cat control. Following cat control the population would increase at 1.8% per year. Our results demonstrate that feral cats predate and have negative impacts on breeding success and population growth rate of wandering albatrosses at Kerguelen Island. We provide recommendations on feral cat control and eradication to mitigate the risk of population decline or local extinction of large albatrosses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDiomedea exulans 3acameras 3acats 3adeath 3aextinction 3apopulation growth 3apopulation viability 3apredation 3apredator control 3arisk 3aseabirds1 ades Monstiers, Baudouin1 aChaigne, Adrien1 aMarteau, Cédric1 aWeimerskirch, Henri1 aDelord, Karine0 tBiological invasions.g2021 Aug., v. 23, no. 8 p.2389-2405dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl66237x1387-35477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-021-02512-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02577naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002500152245012600177520128300303592002801586650001501614650001501629650001601644650001401660650001501674650001301689650002101702650002601723650001501749650001901764650001701783650001501800650002001815650001601835650000901851650002201860700003101882700001801913773012801931856008702059852000902146655001202155IND60771359720221120224758.0220325e20220317xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077135972DNAL7 a10.3390/microorganisms100306382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDal’Rio, Isabella 10aUnraveling the Tropaeolum majus L. (Nasturtium) Root-Associated Bacterial Community in Search of Potential Biofertilizers  aAlthough Tropaeolum majus (nasturtium) is an agriculturally and economically important plant, especially due to the presence of edible flowers and its medicinal properties, its microbiome is quite unexplored. Here, the structure of the total bacterial community associated with the rhizosphere, endosphere and bulk soil of T. majus was determined by 16S rRNA amplicon metagenomic sequencing. A decrease in diversity and richness from bulk soil to the rhizosphere and from the rhizosphere to the endosphere was observed in the alpha diversity analyses. The phylum Proteobacteria was the most dominant in the bacteriome of the three sites evaluated, whereas the genera Pseudomonas and Ralstonia showed a significantly higher relative abundance in the rhizosphere and endosphere communities, respectively. Plant growth-promoting bacteria (236 PGPB) were also isolated from the T. majus endosphere, and 76 strains belonging to 11 different genera, mostly Serratia, Raoultella and Klebsiella, showed positive results for at least four out of six plant growth-promoting tests performed. The selection of PGPB associated with T. majus can result in the development of a biofertilizer with activity against phytopathogens and capable of favoring the development of this important plant.  aPublisher supplied data 3aKlebsiella 3aNasturtium 3aPseudomonas 3aRalstonia 3aRaoultella 3aSerratia 3aTropaeolum majus 3abacterial communities 3abacteriome 3abiofertilizers 3ametagenomics 3amicrobiome 3aplant pathogens 3arhizosphere 3asoil 3aspecies diversity1 aMateus, Jackeline Rossetti1 aSeldin, Lucy 0 tMicroorganisms.g2022 Mar. 17, v. 10, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27145x2076-26077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms100306383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03403naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245008400168300001400252520226700266592002802533650001902561650001402580650002602594650001502620650002202635650001302657650001602670650001202686700001902698700003002717700002002747700002002767700001902787700002502806773009302831856008402924852000903008655001203017IND60086608220221120042827.0141101e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008660822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envsci.2012.06.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRijke, Jeroen10aFit-for-purpose governance: A framework to make adaptive governance operational  ap. 73-84.  aNatural disasters, extreme weather events, economic crises, political change and long term change, such as climate change and demographic change, are in many places forcing a re-think about the way governments manage their environmental resource systems. Over the last decade, the concept of adaptive governance has rapidly gained prominence in the scientific community as a new alternative to the traditional predict-and-control regime. However, many policy makers and practitioners are struggling to apply adaptive governance in practice. Drawing on an extensive, critical literature review of adaptive governance, network management and institutional analysis, we argue that the constraints to the uptake of adaptive governance relate to a large extent to the inability of practitioners and policy makers to cope with complexity and various uncertainties: (i) ambiguous purposes and objectives of what should be achieved with governance; (ii) unclear contextual conditions in which governance takes place; and, (iii) uncertainty around the effectiveness of different governance strategies. To address such practical challenges, this paper introduces a “fit-for-purpose” framework consisting of three key ingredients for developing a diagnostic approach for making adaptive governance operational. We introduce the concept of fit-for-purpose governance to be used as an indication of the effectiveness of governance structures and processes and define it as a measure of the adequacy of the functional purposes that governance structures and processes have to fulfil at a certain point in time. In other words, are existing and proposed governance structures and processes fit for their purpose? While adaptive governance focuses on responding to (potential) change, fit-for-purpose governance is specifically considering the (future) functions that the social and physical components of a particular system, such as an urban water system, have to fulfil. As such, the fit-for-purpose governance framework provides an alternative starting point for developing the much sought-after guidance for policy and decision makers to evaluate the effectiveness of established governance arrangements and to predict the likelihood of success of institutional reform.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3adisasters 3aenvironmental science 3agovernance 3aissues and policy 3apolitics 3auncertainty 3aweather1 aBrown, Rebekah1 aZevenbergen, C.q(Chris),1 aAshley, Richard1 aFarrelly, Megan1 aMorison, Peter1 avan Herk, Sebastiaan0 tEnvironmental science & policy.g2012 Oct., v. 22 p.73-84dElsevier Ltdx1462-90117nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envsci.2012.06.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01750naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002100145245009700166300001600263520068200279592002800961650001100989650001401000650002101014650001201035650000901047650001201056650001101068650001101079650002201090700002101112700001901133700002301152773012501175856007901300852000901379655001201388IND60300850420221120110907.0150703e20130118xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6030085042DNAL7 a10.1126/science.12314342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCoelho, Pedro S.10aOlefin Cyclopropanation via Carbene Transfer Catalyzed by Engineered Cytochrome P450 Enzymes  ap. 307-310.  aPutting a C in Cytochrome Cytochrome P450 enzymes oxidize hydrocarbons using a highly reactive iron oxo intermediate.

The mangrove forest is used to prevent abrasion and as an ecotourism area. This regency has three mangrove ecotourism; they are Mempawah Mangrove Park, Polaria Tanjung Pagar Mangrove Park and Cinta Mangrove Park. Cinta Mangrove Park is the newest mangrove ecotourism in Mempawah Regency. As the latest ecotourism, there are still some shortages, upgrading and developments that need to be done in terms of human resources, facilities and less of promotion. The aim of this research was to determine the development strategy of the Cinta Mangrove Park ecotourism. The location of the research was carried out at the Cinta Mangrove Park Ecotourism in Sungai Bakau Besar Laut Village Sungai Pinyuh Sub-District Mempawah Regency with the consideration that this location was the latest ecotourism that still has a lot of shortages and need improvement. The selected respondents were the key informants. The analysis used was SWOT and QSPM analysis. The results of the research described that the mangrove ecotourism development strategy was a weakness-opportunity (WO) strategy. The main priority of the Cinta Mangrove Park ecotourism development strategy was to seek funding sources and attract investors to collaborate to build tourism facilities. The results of this research were expected to be a contribution in determining policies for the government and society for the development of the Cinta Mangrove Park ecotourism.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acoasts 3aecotourism 3ahumans 3amangrove forests 3avillages1 aDolorosa, Eva0 tSoca : Jurnal Sosial Ekonomi Pertanian.g2020 June, v. 14, no. 3 p.398-409dProdi Agribisnis Fakultas Pertanian Universitas UdayanawJournal:27754x2615-66287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.24843/SOCA.2020.v14.i03.p023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02354naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245014900173300001400322520129100336592002801627650002501655650002601680650002601706650001801732650002201750650001801772650001601790700001701806700001901823773009301842856008401935852000902019655001202028IND60086608320221120022145.0141101e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008660832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envsci.2012.05.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 avan den Hoek, R.E.10aShifting to ecological engineering in flood management: Introducing new uncertainties in the development of a Building with Nature pilot project  ap. 85-99.  aBuilding with Nature (BwN) is an innovative approach in flood policy, which aims to use natural system dynamics and materials for the design and realization of flood management projects. However, as natural dynamics are inherently unpredictable, the use of BwN design principles requires a fundamentally different approach to uncertainty in flood management. In this paper, we identify and classify the key uncertainties in the development process of a specific project using BwN design principles: the Sand Engine. Our results indicate that uncertainty about the social implications of applying BwN design principles is more relevant for project development than uncertainty in the factual knowledge base of the natural system. Although uncertainty did not hamper project development in this specific case, the changes in project design evoked by the use of BwN principles do not seem to be followed by proper changes in the development process preceding the project's implementation: in the Sand Engine project's development process, uncertainty is evaluated rather similar as in the current flood management practices. We claim that new approaches towards dealing with uncertainty are needed, to successfully address the uncertainties typical to projects using BwN design principles.  aPublisher supplied data 3adevelopment projects 3aecosystem engineering 3aenvironmental science 3aflood control 3aissues and policy 3asocial impact 3auncertainty1 aBrugnach, M.1 aHoekstra, A.Y.0 tEnvironmental science & policy.g2012 Oct., v. 22 p.85-99dElsevier Ltdx1462-90117nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envsci.2012.05.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02924naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245007400161520148500235592002801720650001801748650001801766650001301784650001101797650001901808650001501827650001901842650002601861650001501887650002301902650001001925650001101935650001301946650001601959650001701975650001401992650002002006650001202026650001202038700002302050700002202073700002202095700002402117700002302141700001902164700001902183773012102202856007402323852000902397655001202406IND60763591420221123010429.0220120e20220106xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076359142DNAL7 a10.3390/v140101002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNakamura, Hideki 10aDoes HTLV-1 Infection Show Phenotypes Found in Sjögren’s Syndrome?  aViruses are a possible cause for Sjögren’s syndrome (SS) as an environmental factor related to SS onset, which exhibits exocrine gland dysfunction and the emergence of autoantibodies. Although retroviruses may exhibit lymphocytic infiltration into exocrine glands, human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) has been postulated to be a causative agent for SS. Transgenic mice with HTLV-1 genes showed sialadenitis resembling SS, but their phenotypic symptoms differed based on the adopted region of HTLV-1 genes. The dominance of tax gene differed in labial salivary glands (LSGs) of SS patients with HTLV 1-associated myelopathy (HAM) and adult T-cell leukemia. Although HTLV-1 was transmitted to salivary gland epithelial cells (SGECs) by a biofilm-like structure, no viral synapse formation was observed. After infection to SGECs derived from SS patients, adhesion molecules and migration factors were time-dependently released from infected SGECs. The frequency of the appearance of autoantibodies including anti-Ro/SS-A, La/SS-B antibodies in SS patients complicated with HAM is unknown; the observation of less frequent ectopic germinal center formation in HTLV-1-seropositive SS patients was a breakthrough. In addition, HTLV-1 infected cells inhibited B-lymphocyte activating factor or C-X-C motif chemokine 13 through direct contact with established follicular dendritic cell-like cells. These findings show that HTLV-1 is directly involved in the pathogenesis of SS.  aPublisher supplied data 3aB-lymphocytes 3aT-lymphocytes 3aadhesion 3aadults 3aautoantibodies 3achemokines 3adirect contact 3aenvironmental factors 3aepithelium 3aetiological agents 3agenes 3ahumans 3aleukemia 3alymph nodes 3apathogenesis 3aphenotype 3asalivary glands 3asynapse 3aviruses1 aTsukamoto, Masako 1 aNagasawa, Yosuke 1 aKitamura, Noboru 1 aShimizu, Toshimasa 1 aKawakami, Atsushi 1 aNagata, Kinya 1 aTakei, Masami 0 tViruses.g2022 Jan. 06, v. 14, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27138x1999-49157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v140101003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01649naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001500145245005300160300001600213520066900229592002800898650001500926650001200941650001900953650001300972700001800985700001801003700001801021700002201039700001701061700002001078773012501098856007901223852000901302655001201311IND60300850520221120110921.0150703e20130118xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6030085052DNAL7 a10.1126/science.12300542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHunt, John10aMetamaterial Apertures for Computational Imaging  ap. 310-313.  aCompressed Sampling It is often said that a picture is worth a thousand words.

Human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can also be used to generate hMSCs with stable characteristics without limitations. Therefore, we differentiated human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs, H-M5) and human embryonic stem cells (hESCs, H9) into hMSCs on dishes coated with different extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins to study the effect of cell culture biomaterials on hPSC differentiation into hMSCs. hPSC-derived MSCs cultured on Matrigel (MAT)-coated, collagen (COL)-coated and laminin-521 (LN-521)-coated tissue culture polystyrene (TCP) dishes showed excellent proliferation speed and reduced aging over 10 passages. High MSC surface marker (CD44, CD73, CD90 and CD105) expression was also observed on hPSC-derived MSCs cultured on MAT-coated, COL-coated and LN-521-coated TCP dishes as well as uncoated TCP dishes. Analysis of late osteogenic differentiation by evaluation of mineral deposition revealed that hPSC-derived MSCs cultured on fibronectin (FN)-coated and LN-521-coated TCP dishes showed high osteogenic differentiation. ECM proteins are effective as coating materials on cell culture biomaterials to regulate the proliferation and differentiation fate of hPSC-derived MSCs.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiocompatible materials 3abone formation 3abone marrow 3acell culture 3achemistry 3acollagen 3aextracellular matrix 3afibronectins 3ahumans 3apolystyrenes 3atissue culture1 aWang, Chun-Ko1 aLin, Feng-Ling1 aLiu, Qian1 aWang, Ting1 aSung, Tzu-Cheng1 aAlarfaj, Abdullah A.1 aHirad, Abdurahman H.1 aLee, Henry Hsin-Chung1 aWu, Gwo-Jang1 aHiguchi, Akon0 tJournal of materials chemistry B.g2022 Aug. 3, v. 10, no. 30 p.5723-5732dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26902x2050-75187nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d2tb01026g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03224naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001400152245015400166520199100320592002802311650001702339650001502356650001102371650001602382650001302398650001702411650001102428650001002439650001302449650001002462650001302472700001802485700001602503700002002519700001802539700001902557700001402576773012802590856008702718852000902805655001202814IND60771360020221123041920.0220325e20220317xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077136002DNAL7 a10.3390/microorganisms100306402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Juan 10aComparison of Fermentation Behaviors and Characteristics of Tomato Sour Soup between Natural Fermentation and Dominant Bacteria-Enhanced Fermentation  aIn this study, the correlations between microbial communities with physicochemical properties and volatile flavor compounds (VFCs) during the fermentation of traditional tomato sour soup (CTN) are explored. The results of high-throughput sequencing (HTS) of CTN showed that Lacticaseibacillus (28.67%), Enterobacter (12.37%), and Providencia (12.19%) were the dominant bacteria in the first round of fermentation, while Lacticaseibacillus (50.11%), Enterobacter (13.86%), and Providencia (8.61%) were the dominant bacteria in the second round of fermentation. Additionally, the dominant fungi genera of the first fermentation were Pichia (65.89%) and Geotrichum (30.56%), and the dominant fungi genera of the second fermentation were Pichia (73.68%), Geotrichum (13.99%), and Brettanomyces (5.15%). These results indicate that Lacticaseibacillus is one of the main dominant bacteria in CTN. Then, the dominant strain Lacticaseibacillus casei H1 isolated from CTN was used as a culture to ferment tomato sour soup to monitor dynamic changes in the physicochemical properties and VFCs during enhanced fermentation of tomato sour soup (TN). The physicochemical analysis showed that, compared with CTN, the TN group not only produced acid faster but also had an earlier peak of nitrite and a lower height. The results of the GC–IMS analysis showed that the ester and alcohol contents in the TN group were 1.26 times and 1.8 times that of the CTN group, respectively. Using an O2PLS-DA analysis, 11 bacterial genera and 18 fungal genera were identified as the functional core flora of the CTN group flavor production, further verifying the importance of dominant bacteria for the production of VFCs. This study proved that enhanced fermentation not only shortens the fermentation cycle of tomato sour soup, but also significantly improves its flavor quality, which has great value in the industrial production of tomato sour soup and in the development of a vegetable fermentation starter.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEnterobacter 3aGeotrichum 3aPichia 3aProvidencia 3aalcohols 3afermentation 3aflavor 3aflora 3anitrites 3asoups 3atomatoes1 aWang, Xiaoyu 1 aWu, Wenyan 1 aJiang, Jingzhu 1 aFeng, Dandan 1 aShi, Yuanyuan 1 aHu, Ping 0 tMicroorganisms.g2022 Mar. 17, v. 10, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27145x2076-26077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms100306403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02169naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001500153245010000168520106600268592002801334650002301362650000801385650001801393650001201411650002901423650001101452653001601463653001001479653002201489653003001511653002101541700001801562700001601580773011401596856008801710852000901798655001201807IND60776789120221119092321.0220614e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077678912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enzmictec.2022.1100562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCai, Guang10aDevelopment and expansion of the CRISPR/Cas9 toolboxes for powerful genome engineering in yeast  aYeasts represent a group of the microorganisms most frequently seen in biotechnology. Recently, the class 2 type II CRISPR system (CRISPR/Cas9) has become the principal toolbox for genome editing. By efficiently implementing genetic manipulations such as gene integration/knockout, base editor, and transcription regulation, the development of biotechnological applications in yeasts has been extensively promoted. The genome-level tools based on CRISPR/Cas9, used for screening and identifying functional genes/gene clusters, are also advancing. In general, CRISPR/Cas9-assisted editing tools have gradually become standardized and function as host-orthogonal genetic systems, which results in time-saving for strain engineering and biotechnological application processes. In this review, we summarize the key points of the basic elements in the CRISPR/Cas9 system, including Cas9 variants, guide RNA, donors, and effectors. With a focus on yeast, we have also introduced the development of various CRISPR/Cas9 systems and discussed their future possibilities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCRISPR-Cas systems 3aRNA 3abiotechnology 3aenzymes 3atranscription (genetics) 3ayeasts 0aCRISPR/Cas9 0aYeast 0aSynthetic Biology 0aMultiplex Genetic editing 0aEffector protein1 aLin, Zhenquan1 aShi, Shuobo0 tEnzyme and microbial technology.g2022 Sept., v. 159 p.110056-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12419x0141-02297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enzmictec.2022.1100563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02944naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005600151245011900207520147200326592002801798650001401826650001501840650001601855650002301871650001801894650001201912650000901924650002101933650001201954650001601966650000901982650002601991650002802017650000902045653001702054653002002071653002202091653003002113653001202143700005902155700005702214773012002271856008602391852000902477655001202486IND60755876320221118131508.0220118e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075587632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jnutbio.2021.1089012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYi, Junyeong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1890-136310aZinc is an essential element for the maintenance of redox homeostasis and cell cycle in murine auditory hair cells  aA nutrition deficiency is one of the various causes of hearing loss. Zinc is an essential element for cell proliferation, antioxidant reactions, and the maintenance of hearing ability. Our previous studies have reported that the auditory brainstem response (ABR) threshold is increased in mice fed with zinc-deficient diets. However, the molecular mechanism of zinc involved in auditory system remains to be elucidated. In the present study, we examined the detrimental effects of zinc deficiency on cell cycle progression in murine auditory cells (HEI-OC1). The treatment of HEI-OC1 cells with 0.5 μM TPEN (N,N,N′,N′-Tetrakis (2-pyridylmethyl) ethylenediamine) for 24 h inhibited cell proliferation, accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and induction of apoptosis. The cell proliferation block was caused by a G1/S phase arrest. Supplementation of the cell growth medium with 5 μM ZnCl₂ after exposure to TPEN attenuated ROS accumulation and the arrest caused by the zinc deficiency. The ABR threshold was elevated in mice fed with a zinc-deficient diet. Additionally, we observed an increased expression of p21 and decreased expression of cyclin E and pRb in the spiral ganglion (SG), the organ of Corti (OC), Limbus (L), and stria vascularis (SV) in the zinc-deficient mouse cochlea. These results indicated that zinc is an essential nutrient for proliferation via the cell cycle and that a dysregulation of the cell cycle may cause hearing loss.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3abrain stem 3acell growth 3acell proliferation 3aculture media 3acyclins 3adiet 3aethylenediamines 3aganglia 3ahomeostasis 3amice 3anutrient deficiencies 3areactive oxygen species 3azinc 0aHearing loss 0azinc deficiency 0acell cycle arrest 0amouse auditory hair cells 0acochlea1 aChung, Jong Woo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0765-91341 aPak, Jhang Ho1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5104-59950 tJournal of nutritional biochemistry.g2022 Feb., v. 100 p.108901-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl44770x0955-28637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jnutbio.2021.1089013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02313naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245013500172520116600307592002801473650000801501650002601509650001501535650002601550650001501576650001701591650001001608650001801618650001501636651001601651700002101667700001901688700002001707773012801727856008701855852000901942655001201951IND60771360120221123041933.0220325e20220317xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077136012DNAL7 a10.3390/microorganisms100306422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYoon, Sunghyun 10aMolecular Typing, Antibiotic Resistance and Enterotoxin Gene Profiles of Staphylococcus aureus Isolated from Humans in South Korea  aThe emergence of antimicrobial-resistant Staphylococcus aureus has become a grave concern worldwide. In this study, 95 strains of S. aureus isolated from stool samples were collected from Busan, South Korea to characterize their antimicrobial susceptibility, enterotoxin genes, and molecular typing using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and random amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD) assay. Only two strains showed no drug resistance, whereas resistance to three or more antibiotics was observed in 87.4% of strains. Ampicillin resistance was the most common at 90% and all strains were susceptible to vancomycin. The distribution of enterotoxin genes encoded in isolates was sea (32.6%), sec (11.6%), seg (19%), sea & sec (2.1%), and sec & seg (34.7%). Molecular typing using both MALDI-TOF MS and RAPD indicated that S. aureus exhibited diverse clonal lineages and no correlations were observed among the profiling of enterotoxin, MALDI-TOF MS, and RAPD. This investigation provides useful information on foodborne pathogenic S. aureus that has a significant public health impact in South Korea.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aampicillin 3aantibiotic resistance 3adesorption 3aenterotoxins 3agenes 3apublic health 3avancomycin 3aSouth Korea1 aPark, Yon Kyoung1 aJung, Tae Sung1 aPark, Seong Bin0 tMicroorganisms.g2022 Mar. 17, v. 10, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27145x2076-26077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms100306423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02977naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002200153245013700175520129300312592002801605650002401633650002101657650002001678650001701698650002201715650001201737650001901749650001501768650001401783650004101797650004201838650001901880650001301899650001801912650002101930650001301951650001101964650001401975650001601989653003602005653002502041653001802066653001802084653002102102700001402123700001502137700001902152700002602171700001502197773011402212856008802326852000902414655001202423IND60776789220221119092146.0220614e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077678922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enzmictec.2022.1100572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbdalla, Mohammed10aPermeabilized whole-cell biocatalyst containing co-expressed two enzymes facilitates the synthesis of maltoheptaose (G7) from starch  aMaltoheptaose (G7) is one of the mixtures of maltodextrin widely used in the food, pharmaceutical, and cosmetics industries. A genetically engineered strain, which simultaneously expressed cyclodextrin glucanotransferase (CGTase) from Gracilibacillus alcaliphilus SK51.001 and cyclomaltodextrinase (CDase) from Bacillus sphaericus E-244, two enzymes, was constructed by cloning the above two genes into a plasmid and transformed into the host Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) (E. coli) strain, resulted in recombinant cells harboring the vector pETDuet-GaCGT/BsCD (pGaBs). These cells were used as whole-cell catalysts for the biotransformation of G7 from the inexpensive substrate (starch). Due to the high molecular weight of starch, the cell membrane prevents the entry of starch into the cellular system. Therefore, the pGaBs cell wall was permeabilized by lysozyme, EDTA, and heat treatment. After reaching the optimized conditions of permeabilized pGaBs cell amount, lysozyme amount, reaction temperature, and metal ion concentration, approximately 4.1 g/L of G7 was produced from 30 g/L starch in 1 h with the addition of Ca²⁺. This co-expression system offers a one-pot synthesis approach to the production of G7 using an inexpensive substrate, avoiding enzyme purification steps.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus sphaericus 3aEscherichia coli 3aGracilibacillus 3abiocatalysts 3abiotransformation 3acalcium 3acell membranes 3acell walls 3acosmetics 3acyclomaltodextrin glucanotransferase 3agenetically engineered microorganisms 3aheat treatment 3alysozyme 3amaltodextrins 3amolecular weight 3aplasmids 3astarch 3asynthesis 3atemperature 0aCyclodextrin glucanotransferase 0aCyclomaltodextrinase 0aMaltoheptaose 0aCo-expression 0aEscherichia coli1 aJiang, Bo1 aDai, Yiwei1 aChen, Jingjing1 aHassanin, Hinawi A.M.1 aZhang, Tao0 tEnzyme and microbial technology.g2022 Sept., v. 159 p.110057-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12419x0141-02297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enzmictec.2022.1100573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01357naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001600142245011400158300001800272520038500290592002800675650001400703650001100717650001100728650001400739650002100753650001600774700001900790700001500809773013200824856007800956852000901034655001201043IND60541858720221119083558.0160823e20160413xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054185872DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.5b135012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Jicheng10aEnantioselective Intermolecular Enamide–Aldehyde Cross-Coupling Catalyzed by Chiral N-Heterocyclic Carbenes  ap. 4706-4709.  aThe unprecedented N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC)-catalyzed intermolecular cross-coupling of enamides and aldehydes is described.

This includes a comparison between the use of batch and fed-batch reactors with and without deacetylation. As a basis of the study, a kinetic model describing the co-fermentation of substrates producing ethanol using Zymomonas mobilis is proposed. The model extends work available in the literature to include acetate inhibition. The reported optimisation studies include realistic variations in feedstock quality, deacetylation, a mechanical pre-treatment stage and a green recovery system: extractive distillation with vapour compression. Results indicate that the use of fed-batch reactors using a deacetylation stage achieves an ethanol yield of between 267 and 334 L/ton dry basis of CS and economic potential of between 0.4-5.5 MM USD/year higher than the use of batch reactors. This also has the lowest energy requirements in the product recovery stage (3.2-3.4 MJ-fuel/kg-ethanol or 1.6-1.8 MJ/kg-ethanol). Omitting de-acetylation prior to hydrolysis/co-fermentation increases the minimum ethanol selling price and energy requirements by ∼3-14% and ∼8-30%, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZymomonas mobilis 3aacetates 3abatch systems 3acorn stover 3adistillation 3aeconomic analysis 3aenergy requirements 3aethanol 3aethanol production 3afeedstocks 3afermentation 3ahydrolysis 3akinetics 3amarket prices 3amodels 3avapors 0aeconomic optimisation 0afed-batch reactors 0akinetic model1 aWillis, Mark J.0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2019 Oct. 15, dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2019.1122003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03563naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002300142245012200165300001600287520201400303592002802317650001802345650002102363650002602384650001102410650002902421650001302450650001102463650000902474650001502483650002102498650002902519650001202548650001002560650001202570650001402582650001402596650001302610650002502623650001602648650001902664650001602683650001302699653002202712653002302734653001902757700002302776773014902799856007602948852000903024655001203033IND60696486420221123001133.0200527e20200523xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069648642DNAL7 a10.1660/062.123.01252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaccarone, Alan D.10aBreeding Phenology and Reproductive Success of Little Blue Herons (Egretta caerulea) in an Urban Mixed-Species Colony  ap. 251-258.  aAs human populations continue to expand into suburban and rural areas, conflicts with wildlife are likely to increase. Many populations of long-legged wading birds (Family Ardeidae) face the challenge of human disturbance both at feeding sites and breeding colonies. Little Blue Herons (Egretta caerulea) are medium-sized wading birds that often join egrets and other herons in mixed-species breeding colonies. In June and July 2018, a random sample of Little Blue Heron nests located in an urban colony were monitored from incubation to fledging. The goals of this study were to (1) characterize adult nest-activity patterns over the course of the breeding cycle, and (2) document Little Blue Heron reproductive success in an urban colony and identify sources of human disturbance. Instantaneous samples with 5-min intervals were used to record adult activity during 50 h of observation at 24 nests. An additional 77 h of continuous observation at two different nests documented fine-scale activities and changes in nesting status. Observations made at random times during morning, midday, and evening periods yielded 636 nest-hours across all breeding stages. During incubation, attending parents mostly sat (63 %) or stood (23 %) in or near their nests, spent less time in nest maintenance (5 %) and self-maintenance (scratching, preening; 5 %), and seldom (< 1 %) left the nest unprotected. By the end of the breeding cycle, nests were unattended 69 % of the time. The 26 monitored nests fledged a total 39 chicks (1.4 ± 0.3 chicks/nest attempt). The 16 successful nests (61 % of all nests) fledged 2.4 ± 0.2 chicks. Known causes of nest failure included destruction or usurpation by Cattle Egrets (Bubulbus ibis) and predation by Black-crowned Night-herons (Nycticorax nycticorax). Sources of disturbance included dogs allowed in the colony, intentional loud noises, and human presence. We compare reproductive success at this urban colony to that in less disturbed colonies reported in the literature.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBubulcus ibis 3aEgretta caerulea 3aNycticorax nycticorax 3aadults 3aanthropogenic activities 3abreeding 3achicks 3adogs 3afledglings 3ahuman population 3ahuman-wildlife relations 3anesting 3anests 3aparents 3aphenology 3apredation 3apreening 3areproductive success 3arural areas 3asuburban areas 3awater birds 3awildlife 0ahuman disturbance 0aLittle Blue Herons 0aurban wildlife1 aHarper, Abigail C.0 tTransactions of the Kansas Academy of Science.g2020 May 23, v. 123, no. 1-2 p.251-258dKansas Academy of SciencewJournal:6278x0022-84437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1660/062.123.01253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02661naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002400152245011600176520145700292592002801749650002201777650001001799650002301809650001801832650000901850650002001859650001101879650002801890650001201918651001201930700002101942700002001963700002101983700002502004700002202029773012802051856008702179852000902266655001202275IND60771360320221123042102.0220325e20220317xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077136032DNAL7 a10.3390/microorganisms100306432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFriedsam, Amelie M.10aGeo-Spatial Characteristics of 567 Places of Tick-Borne Encephalitis Infection in Southern Germany, 2018–2020  aTick-borne encephalitis (TBE) is a growing public health problem with increasing incidence and expanding risk areas. Improved prevention requires better understanding of the spatial distribution and ecological determinants of TBE transmission. However, a TBE risk map at sub-district level is still missing for Germany. We investigated the distribution and geo-spatial characteristics of 567 self-reported places of probable TBE infection (POI) from 359 cases notified in 2018–2020 in the study area of Bavaria and Baden-Wuerttemberg, compared to 41 confirmed TBE foci and 1701 random comparator places. We built an ecological niche model to interpolate TBE risk to the entire study area. POI were distributed heterogeneously at sub-district level, as predicted probabilities varied markedly across regions (range 0–93%). POI were spatially associated with abiotic, biotic, and anthropogenic geo-spatial characteristics, including summer precipitation, population density, and annual frost days. The model performed with 69% sensitivity and 63% specificity at an optimised probability threshold (0.28) and an area under the curve of 0.73. We observed high predictive probabilities in small-scale areas, consistent with the known circulation of the TBE virus in spatially restricted microfoci. Supported by further field work, our findings may help identify new TBE foci. Our fine-grained risk map could supplement targeted prevention in risk areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aecological models 3afrost 3apopulation density 3apublic health 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3asummer 3atick-borne encephalitis 3aviruses 3aGermany1 aBrady, Oliver J.1 aPilic, Antonia 1 aDobler, Gerhard 1 aHellenbrand, Wiebke 1 aNygren, Teresa M.0 tMicroorganisms.g2022 Mar. 17, v. 10, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27145x2076-26077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms100306433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02572naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245010100162520147700263592002801740650002301768650005201791650001601843650001401859650002201873650001501895650001201910700001501922700001901937700002001956700002101976700002101997773012102018856007402139852000902213655001202222IND60763591820221123010108.0220120e20220107xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076359182DNAL7 a10.3390/v140101042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCapoferri, Adam A.12aA Pre-Vaccination Baseline of SARS-CoV-2 Genetic Surveillance and Diversity in the United States  aCOVID-19 vaccines were first administered on 15 December 2020, marking an important transition point for the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the United States (U.S.). Prior to this point in time, the virus spread to an almost completely immunologically naïve population, whereas subsequently, vaccine-induced immune pressure and prior infections might be expected to influence viral evolution. Accordingly, we conducted a study to characterize the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the U.S. pre-vaccination, investigate the depth and uniformity of genetic surveillance during this period, and measure and otherwise characterize changing viral genetic diversity, including by comparison with more recently emergent variants of concern (VOCs). In 2020, SARS-CoV-2 spread across the U.S. in three phases distinguishable by peaks in the numbers of infections and shifting geographical distributions. Virus was genetically sampled during this period at an overall rate of ~1.2%, though there was a substantial mismatch between case rates and genetic sampling nationwide. Viral genetic diversity tripled over this period but remained low in comparison to other widespread RNA virus pathogens, and although 54 amino acid changes were detected at frequencies exceeding 5%, linkage among them was not observed. Based on our collective observations, our analysis supports a targeted strategy for worldwide genetic surveillance as perhaps the most sensitive and efficient means of detecting new VOCs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 3aamino acids 3aevolution 3agenetic variation 3amonitoring 3aviruses1 aShao, Wei 1 aSpindler, Jon 1 aCoffin, John M.1 aRausch, Jason W.1 aKearney, Mary F.0 tViruses.g2022 Jan. 07, v. 14, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27138x1999-49157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v140101043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02613naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001400152245011500166520141000281592002801691650001401719650001101733650002601744650001201770650001601782650002101798650001601819653002801835653002501863653002601888653002201914653002201936700001301958700002001971700001601991700001402007773009802021856008702119852000902206655001202215IND60700328520221120022332.0200831e20201001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070032852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.1151562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRen, Xiao10aTemperature-dependent performance of amorphous silicon photovoltaic/thermal systems in the long term operation  aThe influences of temperature on the performance of amorphous silicon (a-Si) solar cells and photovoltaic (PV) systems are extensively studied in the literature. The benefit from thermal annealing effect at a higher temperature than ambient has been demonstrated, which makes a-Si cells a promising material for photovoltaic/thermal (PV/T) system. However, the temperature-dependent performance of a-Si PV/T system in the long term operation has rarely been reported. The temperature effect will be more complicated than that on a single cell or PV system. Particularly, the exergetic efficiency and mechanical behavior of the PV/T system at different temperatures are unknown. To fill the above knowledge gap, two identical a-Si PV/T systems are developed. One operates at a water inlet temperature of 60 °C with an a-Si cell temperature of up to 70 °C. The other operates at an inlet temperature of 30 °C. Long-term outdoor tests from December 2017 to June 2019 have been conducted. Results indicate that the difference in the electrical efficiency between the two systems is 0.47% in the initial stage, and it gradually narrows to only 0.13% over time. The overall exergy efficiency at 60 °C generally exceeds that at 30 °C, which proves the superiority of the a-Si PV/T operating at medium temperature. Besides, the long-term operation at 60 °C has not led to a lower level of reliability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aannealing 3aexergy 3amechanical properties 3asilicon 3asolar cells 3asolar collectors 3atemperature 0aAmorphous silicon cells 0aPhotovoltaic/thermal 0aLong-term experiments 0aEnergy efficiency 0aExergy efficiency1 aLi, Jing1 aJiao, Dongsheng1 aGao, Datong1 aPei, Gang0 tApplied energy.g2020 Oct. 01, v. 275 p.115156-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.1151563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03146naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245015200169300001300321520150100334592002801835650001301863650001201876650001901888650001101907650002601918650001301944650001101957650002101968650001601989650002002005650002302025650001602048650001902064650001902083650001802102650001502120650003202135650002002167653002802187653005302215653003402268653002802302653003802330700001302368700001402381700001802395773011002413856008402523852000902607655001202616IND60603054520221122044334.0180712e20150508xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060305452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2015.03.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeng, Juanjuan10aFacile modification of multi-walled carbon nanotubes–polymeric ionic liquids-coated solid-phase microextraction fibers by on-fiber anion exchange  ap. 8-17.  aIn situ anion exchange has been proved to be an efficient method for facile modification of polymeric ionic liquids (PILs)-based stationary phases. In this work, an on-fiber anion exchange process was utilized to tune the extraction performance of a multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs)-poly(1-vinyl-3-octylimidazolium bromide) (poly(VOIm⁺Br⁻))-coated solid-phase microextraction (SPME) fiber. MWCNTs were first coated onto the stainless steel wire through a layer-by-layer fabrication method and then the PILs were coated onto the MWCNTs physically. Anion of the MWCNTs–poly(VOIm⁺Br⁻) fiber was changed into bis(triflroromethanesulfonyl)imide (NTf2⁻) and 2-naphthalene-sulfonate (NapSO3⁻) by on-fiber anion exchange. Coupled to gas chromatography, the MWCNTs–poly(VOIm⁺Br⁻) fiber showed acceptable extraction efficiency for hydrophilic and hydrogen-bonding-donating alcohols, with limits of detection (LODs) in the range of 0.005–0.05μgmL⁻¹; after the anion exchange with NTf2⁻, the obtained MWCNTs–poly(VOIm⁺NTf2⁻) fiber brought wide linear ranges for hydrophobic n-alkanes with correlation coefficient (R) ranging from 0.994 to 0.997; aromatic property of the fiber was enhanced by aromatic NapSO3⁻ anions to get sufficient extraction capacity for phthalate esters and halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons. The MWCNTs–poly(VOIm⁺NapSO3⁻) fiber was finally applied to determine several halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons in groundwater of industrial park.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalcohols 3aalkanes 3aanion exchange 3aanions 3aaromatic hydrocarbons 3abromides 3acarbon 3acarbon nanotubes 3acorrelation 3adetection limit 3agas chromatography 3agroundwater 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3aionic liquids 3aphthalates 3asolid phase microextraction 3astainless steel 0aOn-fiber anion exchange 0aSolid-phase microextraction–gas chromatography 0aMulti-walled carbon nanotubes 0aPolymeric ionic liquids 0aHalogenated aromatic hydrocarbons1 aSun, Min1 aBu, Yanan1 aLuo, Chuannan0 tJournal of chromatography.g2015 May 08, v. 1393 p.8-17dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl50504x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2015.03.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02302naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245012200156300001800278520109600296592002801392650001401420650002101434650002201455650001901477650002501496650001601521650000901537650001401546650002201560650001301582650001601595700001801611700001701629700001701646700001501663773014201678856007501820852000901895655001201904IND60786626120221120040301.0220805e20220803xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078662612DNAL7 a10.1039/d2tb01242a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Jingbo10aZwitterionic polymer coated sorafenib-loaded Fe₃O₄ composite nanoparticles induced ferroptosis for cancer therapy  ap. 5784-5795.  aFerroptosis, as a form of cell death different from apoptosis, is very promising for the treatment of cancer in nonapoptotic systems. Since iron is a key component in the induction of ferroptosis in cells, the use of iron-based nanomaterials in treating cancer through ferroptosis is of great significance. Therefore, in this study, magnetic nanoparticles (MNP) were coated with the zwitterionic polymer poly(2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine) (PMPC), and then loaded with sorafenib (SRF) to obtain drug-loaded composite nanoparticles MNP@PMPC-SRF. Fe₃O₄ provided a large number of ferric/ferrous ions as an iron source, releasing Fe²⁺ for the regulation of the ferroptosis process and enhancing the effect of the induced cellular ferroptosis on the treatment of colon cancer with SRF. The zwitterionic polymer PMPC effectively extended the blood circulation time, resulting in an enhanced tumor accumulation of the nanodrug. MNP@PMPC-SRF exhibited good biocompatibility for in vivo application and showed an excellent tumor inhibitory effect on HCT116 tumor-bearing nude mice.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3abiocompatibility 3ablood circulation 3acancer therapy 3acolorectal neoplasms 3aferroptosis 3airon 3amagnetism 3aphosphorylcholine 3apolymers 3azwitterions1 aZhang, Jiaxin1 aWang, Guang,1 aGuo, Shengdi1 aYang, Wuli0 tJournal of materials chemistry B.g2022 Aug. 3, v. 10, no. 30 p.5784-5795dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26902x2050-75187nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d2tb01242a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02743naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004700094040001800141100002000159245014600179520111200325592002801437650002201465650001601487650001601503650002301519650001601542650002101558650001101579650001401590650001601604650001301620653001101633653001101644653001901655653001501674653001401689700002101703700002801724700002601752700003101778700002001809700002101829700006601850700002801916700002201944700001801966700002401984773011402008856009402122852000902216655001202225IND60776789520221119091900.0220628e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077678952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2022.1099732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRozas, Robinson10aSolvent effects on the molecular structure of isolated lignins of Eucalyptus nitens wood and oxidative depolymerization to phenolic chemicals  aThe aim of the present work was to study the effect of a solvent/water mixture on the structural characteristics of extracted lignin from Eucalyptus nitens, and to relate the functional groups and interunit linkages present in the lignin with the distribution of phenolic compounds obtained after its alkaline oxidation. The high content of β-O-4′ substructures linked to a S unit in organosolv lignins of E. nitens lignin could be linked to the high yield of syringaldehyde in its alkaline oxidation. Kraft lignin oxidation gives rise to lower content of syringaldehyde when compared with organosolv lignins. This might be due to the higher proportion of condensed structures, mainly β-β´ (∼42%) and spirodienone (∼14%). Fukui functions showed that the regions with higher probability for an electrophilic attack on lignin would be located on phenyl rings and on the phenolic –OH group (benzylic position), whereas nucleophilic attacks in some cases were located over the double bond and ring. This work contributed to a better description of the proposed oxidative depolymerization mechanisms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEucalyptus nitens 3aLewis acids 3aLewis bases 3achemical structure 3adegradation 3adepolymerization 3alignin 3aoxidation 3aprobability 3asolvents 0aLignin 0aNitens 0aSyringaldehyde 0aOrganosolv 0aOxidation1 aAspée, Nicolás1 aNegrete-Vergara, Camila1 aVenegas-Yazigi, Diego1 aGutiérrez-Cutiño, Marlen1 aMoya, Sergio A.1 aZúñiga, César1 aCantero-López, Plinio1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4090-98791 aLuengo Sánchez, Jorge,1 aGonzález, Raúl,1 aRomero, Julio1 aYáñez-S, Mauricio0 tPolymer degradation and stability.g2022 July, v. 201 p.109973-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12486x0141-39107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2022.1099733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02110naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003100150245007200181300002000253520096100273592002801234596008401262596010101346596005401447650001201501650001501513650001401528700005601542773011601598856008501714852000901799655001201808IND60791745620220831000000.0220831e20220816xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079174562DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.2c014122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVega-Sánchez, Christopher10aSlightly Depleted Lubricant-Infused Surfaces Are No Longer Slippery  ap. 10568-10574.  aTextured surfaces infused with a lubricating fluid effectively reduce fouling and drag. These functions critically depend on the presence and distribution of the lubricant, which can be depleted by many mechanisms, including shear flow. We present a two-phase Couette flow computational dynamic simulation over lubricant-infused surfaces containing grooves oriented perpendicular to the flow direction, with the aim of revealing how interfacial slip, and therefore drag reduction, is impacted by lubricant depletion. We show that even a slight (20%) lubricant loss decreases slip to the point of making the lubricant superfluous, even for lubricants with lower viscosity than the flowing liquid and regardless of how well the lubricant wets the grooves. We explain that the drastic slip reduction is linked to a significant increase in the total viscous dissipation and to zero dissipation in the lubricant (similar to the one given by a no-slip boundary).  aPublisher supplied data  aFT180100214cAustralian Research Councildhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100000923  aNAcMinisterio de Ciencia Tecnolog?a y Telecomunicacionesdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100006473  aNAcTecnologico de Costa Ricadhttps://doi.org/NA 3aliquids 3alubricants 3aviscosity1 aNeto, Chiara1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6058-08850 tLangmuir.g2022 Aug. 16, v. 38, no. 34 p.10568-10574dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19170x1520-58277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.2c014123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02690naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002100142245012600163300001800289520107300307592002801380650002801408650001801436650002101454650002501475650001501500650001901515650002201534650001801556650001401574650002101588650001201609650001201621650001901633650004401652700002501696700001701721700001801738700001501756700001601771700001401787700001601801700001201817700001801829700001701847700002301864700002401887700001801911773013201929856007802061852000902139655001202148IND60541859020221119085532.0160823e20160413xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054185902DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.6b001112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiao, Jiahn-Haur12aA Multivalent Marine Lectin from Crenomytilus grayanus Possesses Anti-cancer Activity through Recognizing Globotriose Gb3  ap. 4787-4795.  aIn this study, we report the structure and function of a lectin from the sea mollusk Crenomytilus grayanus collected from the sublittoral zone of Peter the Great Bay of the Sea of Japan. The crystal structure of C. grayanus lectin (CGL) was solved to a resolution of 1.08 Å, revealing a β-trefoil fold that dimerizes into a dumbbell-shaped quaternary structure. Analysis of the crystal CGL structures bound to galactose, galactosamine, and globotriose Gb3 indicated that each CGL can bind three ligands through a carbohydrate-binding motif involving an extensive histidine- and water-mediated hydrogen bond network. CGL binding to Gb3 is further enhanced by additional side-chain-mediated hydrogen bonds in each of the three ligand-binding sites. NMR titrations revealed that the three binding sites have distinct microscopic affinities toward galactose and galactosamine. Cell viability assays showed that CGL recognizes Gb3 on the surface of breast cancer cells, leading to cell death. Our findings suggest the use of this lectin in cancer diagnosis and treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantineoplastic activity 3abinding sites 3abreast neoplasms 3acarbohydrate binding 3acell death 3acell viability 3acrystal structure 3agalactosamine 3agalactose 3ahydrogen bonding 3alectins 3aligands 3aneoplasm cells 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy1 aChien, Chih-Ta

HDV was the sole known deltavirus for decades and believed to be a human-only pathogen. However, since 2018, several groups reported finding HDV-like agents from various hosts but without co-infecting hepadnaviruses. In vitro systems enabling helper virus-independent replication are key for studying the newly discovered deltaviruses. Others and we have successfully used constructs containing multimers of the deltavirus genome for the replication of various deltaviruses via transfection in cell culture. Here, we report the establishment of deltavirus infectious clones with 1.2× genome inserts bearing two copies of the genomic and antigenomic ribozymes. We used Swiss snake colony virus 1 as the model to compare the ability of the previously reported “2× genome” and the “1.2× genome” infectious clones to initiate replication in cell culture. Using immunofluorescence, qRT-PCR, immuno- and northern blotting, we found the 2× and 1.2× genome clones to similarly initiate deltavirus replication in vitro and both induced a persistent infection of snake cells. The 1.2× genome constructs enable easier introduction of modifications required for studying deltavirus replication and cellular interactions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBoa constrictor 3aHepatitis B virus 3acell culture 3achronic diseases 3afluorescent antibody technique 3agenome 3agenomics 3aglycoproteins 3ahepatitis 3ahumans 3amixed infection 3apathogens 3aribozymes 3asnakes 3atransfection 3aviruses1 aHetzel, Udo 1 aKipar, Anja 1 aHepojoki, Jussi 0 tViruses.g2022 Jan. 08, v. 14, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27138x1999-49157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v140101073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03050naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004700094040001800141100001800159245015000177520130900327592002801636650001501664650001701679650001301696650002101709650001501730650001701745650001001762650001501772650001501787653001601802653003201818653001901850653000801869653000701877653000901884653001001893653000901903653001001912653000901922653000901931653000801940653000801948653000901956653000901965653000901974653000801983653000801991653000901999653000802008653000802016653000802024653000702032653000802039700001502047700001602062700002002078700001902098700005402117773011402171856009402285852000902379655001202388IND60776789720221119092238.0220628e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077678972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2022.1099692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShin, Sangbin10aSynthesis and reactivity of novel cinnamonitrile derivatives as reactive UV stabilizers for enhanced light protection and performance of coatings  aUltraviolet (UV) light is generally harmful to human health and organic compounds (for example, plastics) as it deteriorates the long-term stability via photodegradation. Thus, an efficient strategy for reducing light-induced damage is the key to maximizing the operation lifetime or durability of materials. The most common means of preventing UV light-induced damage is by adding compounds that possess excellent UV absorbing capability. In this study, novel cinnamonitrile derivatives were designed and synthesized for their application as UV absorbers in pressure-sensitive adhesives. Absorption wavelengths were finely tuned by simple structural modification, and better molar absorptivity was obtained. The hydroxyhexyl functional group affixed into the cinnamonitrile core granted superior solubility (>10 wt%) in common organic solvents and acrylic monomers/resins, instigating enhanced UV blocking and visible light transparency. Further, to enhance the solubility and long-term stability of UV absorbers within a network, hydroxyhexyl-functionalized cinnamonitrile UV absorber was incorporated into urethane-based crosslinkers. Covalently attached reactive UV absorbers improved the adhesion property even at a high loading of UV absorber and remarkable physical persistence within the network.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aabsorptivity 3aadhesion 3achemical bonding 3adurability 3ahuman health 3alight 3aphotolysis 3asolubility 0aUV absorber 0aPressure-sensitive adhesive 0aCinnamonitrile 0aATR 0aBA 0aBAPO 0aDBTDL 0aEDGs 0aESIPT 0aEWGs 0aFTIR 0aGPC 0aHEA 0aHOMO 0aIPDI 0aLUMO 0aNMR 0aPPG 0aPSAs 0aRhB 0aTSC 0aUTM 0aUV 0aVis1 aSim, Eunji1 aLee, Wonjoo1 aPaik, Hyun-jong1 aYu, Youngchang1 aAhn, Dowon1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4837-00380 tPolymer degradation and stability.g2022 July, v. 201 p.109969-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12486x0141-39107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2022.1099693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02719naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245009500168300001400263520147400277592002801751650001201779650001801791650001901809650001001828650001301838650001101851650001201862650002101874650001101895651001001906653004401916653002701960653000901987653000801996653001402004700001402018700001802032700001402050700001802064773009702082856008502179852000902264655001202273IND60755876920221118130817.0211206e20220101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075587692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.wasman.2021.10.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGalderisi, A.10aPetrography of construction and demolition waste (CDW) from Abruzzo region (Central Italy)  ap. 61-71.  aThe density, colour and texture, plus mineral and chemical features of 18 ceramic-like CDW samples from the Abruzzo region (Central Italy) were characterised. The concretes, natural stones, tiles, roof-tiles, bricks and perforated bricks are either aphanitic to porphyric. Concretes and natural stones are grey to white and tend to be > 2.0 g/cm³; the masonries are brown to reddish and close to < 2.0 g/cm³. Concrete and natural stone are rich or even exclusively made up of calcite, with high amounts of CaO (>40 wt%) and LOI (volatiles, CO₂ + H₂O). The masonries are instead calcite-, CaO- (<25 wt%) and LOI-poor (<8 wt%) but enriched in SiO₂ (45 to 70 wt%) stabilised as quartz and/or cristobalite, with significant amount of Al₂O₃ (12 to 20 wt%). S and Cl contents are similar among concrete, bricks and perforated bricks.The petrography of CDW concretes is similar among geographical areas with abundance of limestones used as aggregates. However, in limestone-poor areas CDW are SiO₂- and Al₂O₃-rich, reflecting the prevalent use of masonry and/or silicate-rich construction materials, implying that each geographical area is characterised by peculiar CDW composition. Therefore, the knowledge of mesoscopic, physical and petrographic aspects has to be known for planning adequate sorting methods, promoting upcycling reusing applications. Some of the studied CDW samples are susceptible to release relative high Cr and As content.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcite 3acalcium oxide 3acarbon dioxide 3acolor 3aconcrete 3aquartz 3atexture 3awaste management 3awastes 3aItaly 0aCDW (construction and demolition waste) 0aAbruzzo region (Italy) 0aXRPD 0aXRF 0aRecycling1 aIezzi, G.1 aBianchini, G.1 aParis, E.1 aBrito, J. de,0 tWaste management.g2022 Jan. 01, v. 137 p.61-71dElsevier LtdwJournal:6325x0956-053X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2021.10.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01150naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245005200164300001400216520026000230592002800490650001000518650001200528651001700540653001600557653001900573653001300592700002100605773013200626856008100758852000900839655001200848IND60696486720221123001343.0200527e20200526xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069648672DNAL7 a10.1639/0747-9859-37.2.282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAllen, Bruce10aSchistidium agassizii Confirmed in Pennsylvania  ap. 28-30.  aSchistidium agassizii is confirmed for Pennsylvania, after an earlier report of the species from the commonwealth was found to be misdetermined.

This study facilely synthesized a novel phosphorus-doped silica sol system using 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane, glutaraldehyde, diethyl phosphite by simultaneous Kabachnik-Fields and sol-gel reactions. The morphology and chemical structures of hybrid silica particles were studied by TEM, FT-IR and NMR. Then, the hybrid silica sol was applied as durable FR coating to reduce the flammability of silk. The FR property and washing durability, smoke and heat generation capacity, thermal stability, and FR mechanism of coated silk fabrics were explored. The hybrid silica coating displayed good FR performance because of the synergistic action among Si, P and N. The coated fabrics self-extinguished after 25 launderings and had a high LOI value of 28.0% thanks to the covalent grafting of hybrid silica coating on silk fabrics. The explorations on silk residues confirmed the intumescent FR mechanism of coated silk. The hybrid silica coating is promising to functional as feasible and durable FR strategy for silk fabric.  aPublisher supplied data 3adegradation 3adurability 3aflame retardants 3aflammability 3aglutaraldehyde 3aheat 3apolymers 3asilica 3asilk 3asilk fabric 3asmoke 3asynergism 3athermal stability 0aFlame retardancy 0aThermal stability 0aSilk fabric 0aSol-gel 0aSurface coating 0aWashing durability 0aFR 0aAPTES 0aDEP 0aTEM 0aNMR 0aATR-FTIR 0aSEM 0aEDS 0aLOI 0aPCFC 0aTGA 0aDs 0aHRR1 aDong, Shuang1 aYang, Hai-Jun1 aZhao, Li-Ping1 aGuan, Jin-Ping0 tPolymer degradation and stability.g2022 July, v. 201 p.109974-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12486x0141-39107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2022.1099743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02764naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245009700173520158900270592002801859650002301887650001701910650002401927650002101951650001501972650002301987650001802010650001302028650001702041650001402058700002102072700003102093700002002124700002202144773012802166856008702294852000902381655001202390IND60771360720221120060835.0220325e20220317xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077136072DNAL7 a10.3390/microorganisms100306462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSoth, Sereyboth 10aBiological Control of Diamondback Moth—Increased Efficacy with Mixtures of Beauveria Fungi  aDiamondback moth (DBM) is an important horticultural pest worldwide as the larvae of these moths feed on the leaves of cruciferous vegetables. As DBM has developed resistance to more than 100 classes of synthetic insecticides, new biological control options are urgently required. Beauveria species are entomopathogenic fungi recognized as the most important fungal genus for controlling a wide range of agricultural, forestry, and veterinary arthropod pests. Previous research, aimed at developing new Beauveria-based biopesticides for DBM, has focused on screening single isolates of Beauveria bassiana. However, these fungal isolates have individual requirements, which may limit their effectiveness in some environments. This current study separately assessed 14 Beauveria isolates, from a range of habitats and aligned to four different species (Beauveria bassiana, B. caledonica, B. malawiensis, and B. pseudobassiana), to determine the most effective isolate for the control of DBM. Further assays then assessed whether selected combinations of these fungal isolates could increase the overall efficacy against DBM. Six Beauveria isolates (three B. bassiana and three B. pseudobassiana) achieved high DBM mortality at a low application rate with the first documented report of B. pseudobassiana able to kill 100% of DBM larvae. Further research determined that applications of low-virulent Beauveria isolates improved the control of DBM compared to mixtures containing high-virulent isolates. This novel approach increased the DBM pest mortality and shortened the time to kill.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBeauveria bassiana 3aBrassicaceae 3aPlutella xylostella 3aapplication rate 3aarthropods 3abiological control 3abiopesticides 3aforestry 3ahorticulture 3amortality1 aGlare, Travis R.1 aHampton, J.

The abundance of dominant species in the five communities varied with time. Most obvious in the 1950s was the loss of the extensive Spisula and Mactra patches, which covered most of the shallow parts of the Bank in the 1920s. Since the 1980s, they have been found only as juveniles. The biological regime shift in the late 1980s caused an increase in macrofauna abundance, species numbers, diversity and southern species in most of the communities. The climate regime shift in 2001 had opposite effects in which the abundance, species numbers, diversity and southern species decreased in most of the communities. The increase in interface-feeding species and the decrease in sand-licking amphipods in the 2000s especially in the shallow Bank Community give evidence for climate driven changes in water masses, currents, storms, turbidity and food availability via planktonic or benthic primary production. Both fishing impact and climate change are hypothesised as explaining the changes in the Dogger Bank macrofauna communities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmphipoda 3aSpisula 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3afauna 3afood availability 3ajuveniles 3aprimary productivity 3astorms 3aturbidity 3aNorth Sea0 tEstuarine, coastal and shelf science.g2011 Sept. 10, v. 94, no. 3 p.234-245dElsevier Ltdx0272-77147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecss.2011.06.0153Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01965naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245016800166300001600334520079800350592002801148650002101176650002001197650002201217650001401239651001001253653003001263653001901293653002001312653002401332653003601356700001101392700001101403773009601414856008401510852000901594655001201603IND60479382820221118235419.0160121e20100601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047938282DNAL7 a10.1556/ComEc.11.2010.1.172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, J. -T.12aA comparison of self-organizing feature map clustering with TWINSPAN and fuzzy C-means clustering in the analysis of woodland communities in the Guancen Mts, China  ap. 120-126.  aSOFM (self-organizing feature map) clustering is powerful in analyzing and solving complicated and non-linear problems.

However, little is known about glycerol dehydrogenase genes and their functions in Aspergillus oryzae. Here, a total of 45 glycerol dehydrogenase genes in Aspergillus oryzae were identified and renamed from AoGld1 to AoGld45 according to their chromosome distribution. They were classified into three groups based on phylogenetic analysis. Synteny analysis revealed that thirteen AoGld genes are conserved among Aspergillus species. Promoter analysis displayed that AoGld3 and AoGld13 harbored multiple binding elements of GATA-type transcription factors and zinc-finger protein msnA that were involved in nitrogen and kojic acid metabolism, respectively. Moreover, the AoGld3 deletion strain Δgld3 was generated by the CRISPR/Cas9 system, which had no visible growth defects compared with the control wild-type strain under the control and osmotic stress treatments. However, disruption of AoGld3 led to the inhibition of kojic acid production, and the expression of kojA, kojR was down-regulated in the Δgld3 strain. Furthermore, when kojA or kojR was overexpressed in the Δgld3 strain, the yield of kojic acid was restored, suggesting that AoGld3 is involved in kojic acid production through affecting the expression of kojR and kojA. Taken together, these findings provide new insights into our understanding of glycerol dehydrogenase and establish foundation for further study of their roles in Aspergillus oryzae.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus oryzae 3aCRISPR-Cas systems 3abiotechnology 3achromosomes 3aglycerol dehydrogenase 3akojic acid 3ametabolism 3amicrobiology 3anitrogen 3aosmotic stress 3aphylogeny1 aZhang, Zhe1 aLong, Chuannan1 aHe, Bin1 aHu, Zhihong1 aJiang, Chunmiao1 aZeng, Bin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0632-76720 tWorld journal of microbiology & biotechnology.g2020 Sept., v. 36, no. 9 p.136-136dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl44995x0959-39937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11274-020-02912-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02409naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002600188245016000214300001800374506007600392520100500468592002801473506003701501650002901538650001001567650001501577650001401592650001101606650001901617650001101636650002301647650002201670650001701692650002301709650001901732700003101751773011501782856008101897852000901978655001201987IND60586050020221207134803.0171115e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058605002DNAL7 a10.1007/s13197-017-2887-y2doi7 aPMC56859992pmcid7 a291842252pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLago, Camila Carvalho10aThermodynamic and kinetics study of phenolics degradation and color of yacon (Smallanthus sonchifolius) microparticles under accelerated storage conditions  ap. 4197-4204.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThis study aimed to investigate the kinetics and thermodynamic of the phenolics degradation and the kinetics of degradation of the total color difference of yacon juice microcapsules produced by spray drying using Gum Arabic and polydextrose as wall materials. The degradation of the microcapsule was evaluated by accelerated tests under controlled conditions at 35 and 45 °C, and relative humidity of 75 and 90%, for 35 days. Degradation of phenolics followed the first order model and the degradation constant was in the range of 0.0124–0.0209 days⁻¹. The microparticles with gum Arabic were more stable than those with polydextrose for all conditions studied, with longer half-lives. Both wall materials showed similar thermodynamic characteristics, indicating similar mechanism of degradation of phenolics. With respect to the color parameters, the first order model adjusted to data of the total color difference, and no significant differences were observed for the conditions studied.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSmallanthus sonchifolius 3acolor 3agum arabic 3ahalf life 3ajuices 3amicroparticles 3amodels 3aphenolic compounds 3arelative humidity 3aspray drying 3astorage conditions 3athermodynamics1 aNoreña, Caciano P.

Methods: Samples of retropharyngeal lymph nodes (RLN) and submandibular lymph nodes (SLN) were dissected from the heads of 63 horses that were humanely killed for various unrelated reasons between March and November 2015. DNA extracted from these tissues was subjected to enrichment for EHV-1 sequences by hybridisation with biotin-labelled EHV-1 specific probe, followed by recovery of EHV-1 sequences on streptavidin-coated magnetic beads. Enriched samples were tested for the presence of EHV-1 using nested quantitative real-time PCR. The EHV-1 amplicons were sequenced to determine the genotype of the virus. Results: The median age of the horses was 6 (min 2, max 30) years, and 47/63 (75%) were Thoroughbreds. EHV-1 DNA was detected in RLN samples from 6/63 (10%) horses, and three of these horses were also positive for EHV-1 DNA in SLN. The remaining horses were negative for EHV-1 DNA in both RLN and SLN samples. The N₇₅₂ genotype was detected in all positive samples and the D₇₅₂ genotype was not detected in any of the samples. Conclusions: EHV-1 continues to circulate among horses in New Zealand. The frequency of latent EHV-1 infection among sampled horses may have been underestimated due to the sensitivity limit of the assay or because of the limited anatomical sites sampled in the study. Lack of detection of the D₇₅₂ genotype suggests that infection with this genotype is not common in horses in New Zealand. Clinical Relevance: If live animals are tested for EHV-1 using SLN biopsy it should be kept in mind that negative results do not rule out the presence of latent EHV-1 infection at other sites inaccessible for testing. The RLN appear to be the preferred sample for detection of EHV-1 DNA in horses following recent euthanasia.  aPublisher supplied data  cMinistry for Primary Industriesdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100013420  cNew Zealand Equine Veterinary Associationdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001524  cNew Zealand Equine Health Association 3aDNA 3aEquid alphaherpesvirus 1 3aThoroughbred 3abiopsy 3aeuthanasia 3agenotype 3ahorse diseases 3ahorses 3alymph nodes 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aviruses 3aNew Zealand 0aEquine herpesvirus type-1 0aEHV-1 0aequine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy 0aD752 genotype1 aPearce, P.,1 aDunowska, M0 tNew Zealand veterinary journal.g2020 Jan. 2, v. 68, no. 1 p.23-30dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12298x1176-07107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00480169.2019.16532383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02238naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100006000152245009700212300001600309520103500325592002801360650001501388650001501403650001901418650002101437650001101458650001501469653002501484653001901509653002301528653001801551700005601569700005501625773010101680856008601781852000901867655001201876IND60567143020221116231231.0170710e20160315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056714302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2016.01.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFinesso, Roberto1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9327-223710aFast estimation of combustion metrics in DI diesel engines for control-oriented applications  ap. 254-273.  aThe present work has been focused on the development of low-throughput semi-empirical models to predict the peak firing pressure, indicated mean effective pressure and brake mean effective pressure in direct injection diesel engines. The models have been calibrated and assessed on a 1.6L GM Euro 6 diesel engine, on the basis of the results of experimental tests conducted at a dynamic test bench at GMPT-E (General Motors Powertrain-Europe). Model validation was carried out over “New European Driving Cycle” and “Worldwide Harmonized Light vehicle Test Procedure” missions. The performance of the semi-empirical models has been compared, in terms of prediction accuracy, robustness, inversion efficiency and computational expense, with that of a previously developed real-time physical combustion model. The thus developed semi-empirical models are characterized by a very low computational effort, and are therefore suitable for the development of innovative feed-forward control algorithms in the Engine Control Unit.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acombustion 3adiesel engines 3amodel validation 3amodels 3aprediction 0aSemi-empirical model 0aTorque control 0aCombustion metrics 0aDiesel engine1 aSpessa, Ezio1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5236-619X1 aYang, Yixin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0921-61770 tEnergy conversion and management.g2016 Mar. 15, v. 112 p.254-273dElsevier Ltdx0196-89047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2016.01.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02920naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001800144245009700162300002000259520120300279592002801482650001701510650002501527650002101552650002201573650001101595650001901606650001901625650001901644650001801663650001501681650002801696650001701724653002801741653002101769653003701790653002601827653001901853700001501872700001901887700001601906700001601922700002101938700005701959700001702016700001402033700001902047700001602066700005502082773014202137856007802279852000902357655001202366IND60650876220221122050913.0190710e20190619xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065087622DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.9b063512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Shengyuan10aPorous Nb₄N₅/rGO Nanocomposite for Ultrahigh-Energy-Density Lithium-Ion Hybrid Capacitor  ap. 24114-24121.  aTo meet the increasing demands for high-performance energy storage devices, an advanced lithium-ion hybrid capacitor (LIHC) has been designed and fabricated, which delivers an ultrahigh energy density of 295.1 Wh kg–¹ and a power density of 41 250 W kg–¹ with superior cycling stability. The high-performance LIHC device is based on the uniform porous Nb₄N₅/rGO nanocomposite, which has an intimate interface between the firmly contacted Nb₄N₅ and rGO through the Nb(Nb₄N₅)–O(rGO)–C(rGO) bonds, significantly improving the electron transport kinetics. Moreover, the introduction of rGO nanosheets can prevent the Nb₄N₅ nanoparticles from agglomeration, not only resulting in a larger specific surface area to provide more active sites but also accommodating the strain during Li ion insertion/deinsertion. Therefore, the Nb₄N₅/rGO nanocomposite exhibits a higher reversible specific capacity and better rate and cycling performance than the Nb₄N₅ nanoparticle. In view of the scalable preparation and superior electrochemical characteristics, the Nb₄N₅/rGO nanocomposite would have great potential practical applications in the future energy storage devices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive sites 3aelectrical equipment 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectron transfer 3aenergy 3aenergy density 3agraphene oxide 3ananocomposites 3ananoparticles 3ananosheets 3aphysiological transport 3asurface area 0aNb4N5/rGO nanocomposite 0aporous structure 0aultrahigh energy/power densities 0alithium-ion capacitor 0aenergy storage1 aWang, Ting1 aHuang, Yunpeng1 aWei, Zengxi1 aLi, Guochun1 aNg, Dickon H.

Twenty-four parents (6 male sterile lines and 18 fertility restorers or testers) were used along with their 108 crosses. Combining ability analysis through a line × tester set for 14 agronomic traits in three environments and on a pooled basis revealed the importance of both additive and non-additive genetic effects. However, the predominance of additive components was observed in the inheritance of most traits studied. Environments also influenced the GCA and SCA effects. The female genotypes ICSA-10, ICSA-15 and ICSA-30, the testers ICSR-14 and KLCTENT # 17DTN and the crosses ICSA-30 × KCTENT # 17DTN, ICSA-30 × ICSR-16, ICSA-15 × KCTENT #17DTN and ICSA-10 × ICSR-14 exhibited the highest and significant SCA effects for yield and some of its components, indicating their importance in hybrid development for lowland areas of Ethiopia.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSorghum bicolor 3aagronomic traits 3acrossing 3afemales 3afield experimentation 3agenotype 3agrain sorghum 3agrain yield 3ahybrids 3ainflorescences 3alowlands 3amales 3aparents 3aspecific combining ability 3aEthiopia 0aagronomic traits 0acombining ability 0aline × tester 0a<i>Sorghum bicolor</i>1 aDebello, A.1 aBelete, K.0 tActa agronomica Academiae Scientiarum Hungaricae.g2009 June 1, v. 57, no. 2 p.175-184dAkadémiai Kiadóx0238-01617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1556%2FAAgr.57.2009.2.93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03956naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245012900166300001400295520218900309592002802498596012102526596003502647596002902682650001702711650002002728650001002748650001302758650001902771650001202790650002202802650002302824650003602847650001702883650002102900650001402921650001802935650001102953650001502964650001002979653001002989653001202999653002403011653003803035653002303073700001603096700001803112700001503130700001603145700001403161773012103175856008503296852000903381655001203390IND60676935520221118161856.0191122e20200102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067693552DNAL7 a10.1080/00480169.2019.16554982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNelson, EA10aEffect of a commercial anionic dietary supplement on urinary pH and concentrations of electrolytes and pH in blood of horses  ap. 60-64.  aAims: To compare urine urinary pH, blood pH and concentration of electrolytes in blood of healthy horses fed an anionic salt supplement to achieve diets with a dietary cation-anion difference (DCAD) of −40 or 0 mEq/kg DM, with horses a fed a diet with a DCAD of 85 mEq/kg DM. Methods: Eight healthy horses received each of three diets in a randomised crossover design. Diets consisted of grass hay and concentrate feed, with a varying amount of an anionic supplement to achieve a DCAD of 85 (control), 0 or −40 mEq/kg DM. They were fed for 14 days each with a washout period of 7 days between. Urine pH was measured daily and blood samples were collected on Days 0, 7 and 14 of each study period for the measurement of pH and concentration of electrolytes. Results: Four horses voluntarily consumed the anionic supplement with their feed, but four horses required oral supplement administration via dose syringe. During the study period mean urine pH was lower in horses fed diets with a DCAD of 0 (6.91; SD 0.04) and −40 (6.83; SD 0.04) mEq/kg DM compared to the control diet (7.30; SD 0.04). Compared with horses fed the control diet, mean urine pH was lower in horses fed the 0 and −40 mEq/kg DM diets on Days 1–12 and 14 (p < 0.05) of the study period. On Day 13 it was only lower in horses fed the −40 mEq/kg DM diet (p < 0.01). Urine pH was similar for horses fed the 0 and −40 mEq/kg DM diets (p = 0.151). The DCAD of the diet had no effect on blood pH, ionised Ca or anion gap. Mean concentrations of bicarbonate in blood were affected by diet (p = 0.049); they were lower when horses were fed the 0 mEq/kg diet relative to the control diet on Day 14. Conclusions and clinical relevance: The anionic supplement reduced urine pH in horses fed diets with a DCAD of 0 or −40 mEq/kg DM compared with 85 mEq/kg DM. However as urinary pH did not fall below pH 6.5, the pH below which calcium carbonate uroliths do not form, this reduction in urine pH is unlikely to be clinically significant. The supplement was variably palatable and showed minimal promise as an effective urinary acidifier at the doses administered in this study.  aPublisher supplied data  cUniversity of Florida College of Veterinary Medicine Fall Faculty Research Grantdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100012651  cMerial Summer Scholars Program  cWest Central Cooperative 3abicarbonates 3abladder calculi 3ablood 3ablood pH 3ablood sampling 3acalcium 3acalcium carbonate 3across-over studies 3adietary cation anion difference 3aelectrolytes 3afeed supplements 3agrass hay 3ahorse feeding 3ahorses 3aionization 3aurine 0aHorse 0aurolith 0aurine acidification 0adietary cation–anion difference 0aanionic supplement1 aSanchez, LC1 aMallicote, MF1 aWarren, LK1 aRobelen, AM1 aReuss, SM0 tNew Zealand veterinary journal.g2020 Jan. 2, v. 68, no. 1 p.60-64dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12298x1176-07107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00480169.2019.16554983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02451naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002100146245013700167300001600304520113900320592002801459650000901487650001401496650002101510650001401531650001401545650001201559650001501571650001701586653003901603653003601642653003701678653001701715653002601732700001701758700002101775700002601796773012801822856008201950852000902032655001202041IND60478497120221119154115.0160121e20090901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047849712DNAL7 a10.1556/AAgr.57.2009.3.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEvgenidis, G.

The source populations consisted of maize germplasm from CIMMYT and the F <sub>2</sub> generation of commercial single-cross hybrids. The trials were conducted at three locations in two successive years. Six characteristics relevant to drought stress were recorded. On average, water stress reduced the plant height and ear attachment height, and increased the number of days to silking and the anthesis to silking interval (ASI). The reductions were greater in the diallel crosses, and the increases in the parental populations. At one location, where irrigated and drought-stressed treatments were established side by side, diallel analysis for yield revealed that: (i) the control (B73 × Mo17) and the commercial hybrid <i>Costanza</i> had significantly reduced yield under drought stress; (ii) the general (GCA) and specific (SCA) combining ability were significantly higher in the irrigated experiments; and (iii) populations derived from the F <sub>2</sub> generation showed higher GCA.  aPublisher supplied data 3acorn 3acorn ears 3adiallel analysis 3aflowering 3agermplasm 3ahybrids 3airrigation 3awater stress 0aASI (anthesis to silking interval) 0aGCA (general combining ability) 0aSCA (specific combining ability) 0aplant height 0aear attachment height1 aMellidis, V.1 aKaramaligkas, C.1 aKoutsika-Sotiriou, M.0 tActa agronomica Academiae Scientiarum Hungaricae.g2009 Sept. 1, v. 57, no. 3 p.255-265dAkadémiai Kiadóx0238-01617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1556%2FAAgr.57.2009.3.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03060naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245007900162300001600241520184900257592002802106650001502134650002202149650002302171650001502194650002902209650001102238650002202249650001002271650002202281650001302303653002202316653002602338653002102364653001702385653001802402700001502420700001502435773009602450856008302546852000902629655001202638IND60479383220221118235355.0160121e20101201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047938322DNAL7 a10.1556/ComEc.11.2010.2.62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGioria, M.10aIdentifying the drivers of pond biodiversity: the agony of model selection  ap. 179-186.  aPonds contribute substantially to the maintenance of regional biodiversity. Despite a growing body of literature on biotic-abiotic relationships in ponds, only few generalizations have been made. The difficulty in identifying the main drivers of pond biodiversity has been typically attributed to the heterogeneity of the local and regional conditions characterizing ponds. However, little is known on how the use of different analytical approaches and community response variables affects the results of analysis of community patterns in ponds. Here, we used a range of methods to model the response of water beetle and plant community data (species richness and composition) to a set of 12 environmental and management variables in 45 farmland ponds. The strength of biotic-abiotic relationships and the contribution of each variable to the overall explained variance in the reduced models varied substantially, for both plants and beetles, depending on the method used to analyze the data. Models of species richness included a lower number of variables and explained a larger amount of variation compared to models of species composition, reflecting the higher complexity characterizing multispecies response matrices. Only two variables were never selected by any of the model, indicative of the heterogeneity characterizing pond ecosystems, while some models failed to select important variables. Based on our findings, we recommend the use of multiple modeling approaches when attempting to identify the principal determinants of biodiversity for each response variable, including at least a non-parametric approach, as well as the use of both species richness and composition as the response variables. The results of this modeling exercise are discussed in relation to their practical use in the formulation of conservation strategies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aColeoptera 3aagricultural land 3aanalytical methods 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental management 3amodels 3aplant communities 3aponds 3aspecies diversity 3avariance 0aForward selection 0aMultivariate analysis 0aSpecies richness 0aWater beetle 0aWetland plant1 aBacaro, G.1 aFeehan, J.0 tCommunity ecology.g2010 Dec. 1, v. 11, no. 2 p.179-186dAkadémiai Kiadóx1585-85537nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1556%2FComEc.11.2010.2.63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02330naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245008900156300001600245500002000261520125800281592002801539596004701567596004701614650001801661650001501679650001101694700006001705700005701765773011001822856007501932852000902007655001202016IND60782232320221120030159.0220706e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078223232DNAL7 a10.1111/biom.134482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHong, Ying,10aVarying coefficient frailty models with applications in single molecular experiments  ap. 474-486.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aMotivated by an analysis of single molecular experiments in the study of T‐cell signaling, a new model called varying coefficient frailty model with local linear estimation is proposed. Frailty models have been extensively studied, but extensions to nonconstant coefficients are limited to spline‐based methods that tend to produce estimation bias near the boundary. To address this problem, we introduce a local polynomial kernel smoothing technique with a modified expectation‐maximization algorithm to estimate the unknown parameters. Theoretical properties of the estimators, including their unbiased property near the boundary, are derived along with discussions on the asymptotic bias‐variance trade‐off. The finite sample performance is examined by simulation studies, and comparisons with existing spline‐based approaches are conducted to show the potential advantages of the proposed approach. The proposed method is implemented for the analysis of T‐cell signaling. The fitted varying coefficient model provides a rigorous quantification of an early and rapid impact on T‐cell signaling from the accumulation of bond lifetime, which can shed new light on the fundamental understanding of how T cells initiate immune responses.  aPublisher supplied data  a1660477cDivision of Mathematical Sciences  a1660504cDivision of Mathematical Sciences 3aT-lymphocytes 3aalgorithms 3amodels1 aLin, Li‐Hsiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4464-433X1 aWu, Chien-Fu,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7075-75140 tBiometrics.g2022 June, v. 78, no. 2 p.474-486dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl16956x0006-341X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/biom.134483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03182naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002900144245012100173300002000294520167900314592002801993650001202021650001602033650003102049650001002080650001802090650001202108650001802120650001402138650004402152650001302196650001302209650001702222650002102239653002802260653001702288653001702305653001402322653001202336653002302348653002302371700005702394700002002451773014202471856007802613852000902691655001202700IND60650876420190814000000.0190710e20190612xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065087642DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.9b064452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aElverfeldt, Carl-Philipp10aSelective Control of Ion Transport by Nanoconfinement: Ionic Liquid in Mesoporous Resorcinol–Formaldehyde Monolith  ap. 24423-24434.  aThermal and dynamic properties of ionic liquid (IL)-based electrolytic solution (Li⁺TFSI– in Pyr13⁺TFSI–; 1-methyl-1-propylpyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide = Pyr13⁺TFSI–) confined in nanoporous polymer hosts were investigated with respect to the pore size/porosity and the surface chemistry of the polymer host. As host material, mesoporous resorcinol–formaldehyde (RF) polymer monoliths with three-dimensionally connected pore structure were prepared, with precise control of the pore size ranging from ca. 7 to 60 nm. Thermal analysis of RF polymer–ionic liquid composites showed stability up to almost 400 °C and a melting point depression proportional to the inverse of the pore diameter. Good ionic conductivity comparable to that of a commercial separator is obtained, which is dependent on the porosity (i.e., pore volume) of the confining host material (i.e., the number of charge carriers available in the system). Further pulsed field gradient (PFG) NMR experiments revealed that the diffusion coefficient of Pyr13⁺ cation becomes smaller than that of TFSI– anion inside RF pores, which is contradictory to the bulk IL system. This change in the ionic motion is due to electrostatic attraction between the pore walls and Pyr13⁺ cations, resulting in a layer structure composed of a Pyr13⁺ cation-rich layer adsorbed at the pore wall surface and a TFSI– anion-enriched bulklike layer at the pore center. Our study suggests that transport characteristics of the ions of interest can be controlled by optimizing the surface chemistry of the host framework and their motion can be separately monitored by PFG NMR spectroscopy.  aPublisher supplied data 3acations 3adiffusivity 3aelectrostatic interactions 3ahosts 3aionic liquids 3aliquids 3amelting point 3ananopores 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apolymers 3aporosity 3aporous media 3athermal analysis 0aResorcinol-formaldehyde 0aionic liquid 0aconductivity 0adiffusion 0aPFG NMR 0aconfinement effect 0amesoporous polymer1 aYi, Yŏng-ju,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5782-64311 aFröba, Michael0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2019 June 12, v. 11, no. 27 p.24423-24434dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b064453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02433naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245015200169520121700321592002801538653001601566653002601582653002001608653003301628653003101661653001201692700002101704700005701725700005901782700002201841773015201863856008302015852000902098655001202107IND60750810420221120044626.0211030e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075081042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jics.2021.1001602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSudhakar, Anjali10aExtrudate snacks from rice flour and oyster mushroom powder: Physico-chemical and functional properties characterization and storability evaluation  aReady-to-eat extrudate was prepared from the blend of rice flour and oyster mushroom powder. Process parameters for development of snack were screw speed of 250–350 ​rev/min, feed moisture content of 15–25% (d.b.) and the percentage of oyster mushroom powder in rice flour was maintained in the range of 5–15%. Response surface methodology with the central composite rotatable design was used for the study. The effects of process parameters on the physico-chemical and functional properties were analyzed. It was observed that the screw speed of 330 ​rev/min, feed moisture content of 20% and the percentage of mushroom powder in rice flour of 6.6% gave the most acceptable quality product. The storability of the developed product was checked in three packaging materials, viz. polypropylene (PP), low density polyethylene (LDPE), and metalized propylene (MPP) pouches for three months and it was recommended to store the rice flour-mushroom extruded snack in MPP pouches for better retention of quality. The contemporary work on extrudate snacks from the blend of rice flour and oyster mushroom powder is a good piece of work quite useful for industry dealing with ready-to-eat extrudate products.  aPublisher supplied data 0aScrew speed 0aFeed moisture content 0aMushroom powder 0aResponse surface methodology 0aPhysicochemical properties 0aStorage1 aDash, Sanjaya K.1 aBal, Lalit M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7783-09561 aSahoo, Nihar R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8083-39231 aRayaguru, Kalpana0 tJournal of the Indian Chemical Society.g2021 Oct., v. 98, no. 10 p.100160-dElsevier B.V.aIndian Chemical SocietywJournal:17766x0019-45227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jics.2021.1001603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01567naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245006600160300001600226520060700242592002800849650001900877650000900896650001500905650001400920651002800934653001000962653001300972653001400985653002200999773012801021856008301149852000901232655001201241IND60478497320221119154113.0160121e20090901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047849732DNAL7 a10.1556/AAgr.57.2009.3.112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHadi, G.10aTraditional maize heterosis sources in Eastern Central Europe  ap. 371-375.  aThe main characteristics of the European heterosis sources Mindszentpusztai, Rumai and Many-Rowed Early Flint probably developed in Eastern Central Europe.

We aimed to assess the efficacy of different tree species litter on the recovery of soil physical, chemical, and biological properties over a 5-year period in the Hyrcanian forests, northern Iran. Therefore, treatments included 45 combinations of five treatments (undisturbed area&mdash;UND, untreated trail or bare soil&mdash;U, and three leaf litter types: pure beech&mdash;B, beech-hornbeam&mdash;B-H, and beech-hornbeam-maple&mdash;B-H-M) replicated in three plots in three transects. Results show that the highest litter thickness, and concentrations of C and N in the litter were observed in the UND treatment. The litter C/N ratios were highest in the untreated trail (U; 27.52) followed by B > B-H &asymp; B-H-M > UND treatments. The highest recovery of soil bulk density, total porosity, macroporosity, soil penetration resistance, and aggregate stability was observed on the B-H-M and B-H treatment followed by the B treatment. The highest recovery values of pH, C, N, C/N ratio, C and N sequestration recovery rates were observed on the B-H-M treatment, followed by the B-H treatment. Significantly higher values of available nutrients (P, K, Ca, and Mg), earthworm density, and biomass were found in the UND treatment followed by B-H-M &asymp; B-H > B treatment, while the lowest amounts of available P, K, Ca, and Mg were detected for the U trail. The high-quality litter species (hornbeam and maple) allowed for better recovery of the soil organic matter and increased nutrient availability compared to the lower quality litter (beech). We can conclude that by applying the different litters on compacted soil, the measured soil properties were significantly improved at the B, B-H, and B-H-M treatments. Nevertheless, the soil properties following the B, B-H, and B-H-M treatments still demonstrated significant differences with the UND treatment, even over a 5-year period.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFagus 3aaggregate stability 3abiomass 3acalcium 3acarbon nitrogen ratio 3acompacted soils 3aearthworms 3aecological restoration 3aforest soils 3aforests 3amagnesium 3amulches 3anutrient availability 3apH 3aphosphorus 3aplant litter 3aporosity 3apotassium 3askidders 3asoil density 3asoil organic matter 3asoil penetration resistance 3atrees 3aIran1 aNasirian, Ali1 aLabelle, Eric  R.0 tSustainability.g2018 June 24, v. 10, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su100721483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02697naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245010800172300001600280520142600296592002801722650001401750650001501764650001701779650002001796650002301816650001801839650001601857653002201873653002201895653002401917653002201941700002101963700001801984700002002002700001802022700001702040700002202057773010102079856008602180852000902266655001202275IND60567143320221116232015.0170710e20160315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056714332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2016.01.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStefu, Nicoleta12aA theoretical framework for Ångström equation. Its virtues and liabilities in solar energy estimation  ap. 236-245.  aThe relation between solar irradiation and sunshine duration was investigated from the very beginning of solar radiation measurements. Many studies were devoted to this topic aiming to include the complex influence of clouds on solar irradiation into equations. This study is focused on the linear relationship between the clear sky index and the relative sunshine proposed by the pioneering work of Ångström. A full semi-empirical derivation of the equation, highlighting its virtues and liabilities, is presented. Specific Ångström – type equations for beam and diffuse solar irradiation were derived separately. The sum of the two components recovers the traditional form of the Ångström equation. The physical meaning of the Ångström parameter, as the average of the clouds transmittance, emerges naturally. The theoretical results on the Ångström equation performance are well supported by the tests against measured data. Using long-term records of global solar irradiation and sunshine duration from thirteen European radiometric stations, the influence of the Ångström constraint (slope equals one minus intercept) on the accuracy of the estimates is analyzed. Another focus is on the assessment of the degradation of the equation calibration. The temporal variability in cloud transmittance (both long-term trend and fluctuations) is a major source of uncertainty for Ångström equation estimates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aequations 3aradiometry 3asolar energy 3asolar radiation 3atemporal variation 3atransmittance 3auncertainty 0aSolar irradiation 0aSunshine duration 0aCloud transmittance 0aLinear regression1 aPaulescu, Marius1 aBlaga, Robert1 aCalinoiu, Delia1 aPop, Nicolina1 aBoata, Remus1 aPaulescu, Eugenia0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2016 Mar. 15, v. 112 p.236-245dElsevier Ltdx0196-89047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2016.01.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03151naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245009100163300001600254520175200270592002802022650001602050650001602066650001902082650000902101650001002110650001602120650001302136650001602149650002102165650002002186650001502206650001402221650002402235650002302259650001102282651001302293700001902306700001602325700002002341700001902361700002002380700001902400700001702419773013002436856008202566852000902648655001202657IND6036858020221122033033.0210820e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND603685802DNAL7 a10.1007/s10841-011-9398-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLandis, D. A.10aInsect conservation in Michigan prairie fen: addressing the challenge of global change  ap. 131-142.  aPrairie fen is a globally rare, groundwater dependent peatland community restricted to discrete portions of the glaciated north central USA. Prairie fen harbours a diverse flora composed of sedge wetland and tallgrass prairie species, which in turn support a diversity of rare insects. In Michigan, USA over 20% of the state’s insects of conservation concern are associated with prairie fen, including the globally imperilled Mitchell’s satyr butterfly, Neonympha mitchellii mitchellii (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae). Here we investigate how global change drivers, including land use change, climate change, and invasive species, may interact to threaten this important community. Specifically, we examine how characteristics of prairie fen habitats—e.g., formation and distribution—interact with the biology of rare fen insects to suggest appropriate short to long term conservation strategies. Our results suggest that prairie fen associated insects are rare for a variety of reasons, including host plant specialization, habitat specialization, and shifting landscape context that limits opportunities for dispersal. We recommend that current conservation efforts focus on stabilization and restoration of existing prairie fens, coupled with directed surveys to monitor population change in insects of concern, and restoration of the landscape matrix to facilitate metapopulation dynamics. In the future, due to the severely fragmented nature of Michigan landscapes, captive rearing and assisted migration may be necessary to conserve some prairie fen insect species. Overall, the effective conservation of fen associated insects will require a shared vision by multiple actors and a willingness to purse that vision over a long time frame.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNymphalidae 3abutterflies 3aclimate change 3afens 3aflora 3agroundwater 3ahabitats 3ahost plants 3ainvasive species 3aland use change 3alandscapes 3apeatlands 3apopulation dynamics 3atallgrass prairies 3avision 3aMichigan1 aFiedler, A.

We addressed the hypothesis that shifts in plant functional traits are associated with the adaptive function of animal species which have an indirect trophic link. We compared community characteristics and functional traits of two trophically detached biotic groups (vascular plants and carabid beetles) along a primary succession on terrain at the Cedec glacier in the Alps, where deglaciation events following post-Little Ice Age climate warmings are marked by moraine ridges. Morphofunctional traits were recorded: canopy height (CH), leaf dry matter content (LDMC), leaf dry weight (LDW) and specific leaf area (SLA) (for plants) and the number of brachypterous, autumn-breeding and predator species, and average body length (for carabid beetles). We found that vegetation cover and plant species richness gradually increased throughout early succession, with an abrupt increase between 40 and 150 years after deglaciation. At the early stages of the succession plant traits were typical of ruderal species (high SLA, low CH, LDW) whilst a shift in traits towards stress-tolerance (low SLA) occurred >150 years. Carabid communities and traits changed alongside changes in plant species richness and cover, with late successional vegetation hosting larger, more diverse, less mobile carabid species with longer larval development. Thus, ruderal plant strategies are the main contributors during vegetation development, determining vegetation quantity, and probably have the greatest impact on changes in carabid assemblages by regulating resource availability. Plants then require greater stress-tolerance to survive in stable vegetation, which supports high carabid diversity. This suggests that different plant strategies may affect ground beetle communities via contrasting mechanisms: both quantities (biomass, species richness) and qualities (functional traits, adaptive strategies) should be taken into account during studies of plant-animal interactions within ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCarabidae 3aanimals 3abiomass 3abody length 3acanopy 3aclimate 3adry matter content 3aecosystems 3afood chain 3afunctional properties 3aglaciers 3ainsect communities 3alarval development 3aleaf area 3aleaves 3aprimary succession 3aspecies diversity 3astress tolerance 3avascular plants 3avegetation cover 3aAlps region 0aCarabid beetles 0aFunctional traits 0aPrimary succession 0aSpecies richness 0aVascular plants1 aCaccianiga, M.1 aCerabolini, B.1 aBernardi, F.1 aLuzzaro, A.1 aPierce, S.0 tCommunity ecology.g2010 Dec. 1, v. 11, no. 2 p.223-231dAkadémiai Kiadóx1585-85537nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1556%2FComEc.11.2010.2.113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01546naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003100150245006200181300001800243520049800261592002800759650002100787650002300808650002300831650002000854653001800874653001500892653002000907653002800927653002700955700002100982773011201003856008401115852000901199655001201208IND60599502120221118104239.0180702e20140730xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059950212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2014.06.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMahadevegowda, Surendra H.10aTotal syntheses of (±)-cis- and (±)-trans-neocnidilides  ap. 4400-4403.  aTotal syntheses of two antimicrobial natural products (±)-cis-neocnidilide and (±)-trans-neocnidilide starting from a readily preparable cyclohexa[b]-fused 5-oxabicyclo[2.1.1]hexane derivative are presented.

Plant growth analysis and growth parameters  ap. 267-276.  a2019-12-06  aThe use of growth analysis and growth parameters could make an important contribution to improving the utilisation of N fertiliser by maize hybrids. In 2001 and 2002 the effect of four N fertiliser rates (0, 80, 160, 240 kg ha <sup>−1</sup>) on the growth and productivity of three maize hybrids with different vegetation periods was studied in a long-term experiment involving continuous maize, representing a stress environment, set up in Martonvásár on chernozem soil with forest residues almost 50 years ago. Each year eight samples were taken at 14-day intervals for the destructive method of growth analysis. N fertiliser was found to have a significant effect on the growth parameters of individual plants (RGR, NAR, LAR) in both the vegetative and generative stages of growth, up to N rates of 80 and 160 kg ha <sup>−1</sup> , respectively. The value of RGR increased until the N <sub>160</sub> treatment and that of NAR until N <sub>80</sub> , while LAR declined significantly in response to N fertilisation. RLGR was enhanced by N fertiliser up to a rate of N <sub>80</sub> , and all the N treatments reduced the extent of leaf withering. Among the growth parameters of the canopy, the values of CGR and HI rose significantly up to N <sub>160</sub> and that of LAI <sub>max</sub> up to N <sub>80</sub> . The cumulative values of LAD and BMD were highest in the N <sub>160</sub> treatment. All the growth parameters increased as the vegetation period of the hybrids lengthened, and all reflected the year effect. Compared to the highest N rate, N stress of 29–38% was calculated for the control treatment. On average, N fertilisation resulted in a 6–27% relative decline in LAI after flowering.  aPublisher supplied data 3aplant growth 3aZea mays 3acanopy 3aflowering 3ahybrids 3aplant residues 3afertilizer rates 3aleaf area index 3acorn 3aforest soils 3avegetation 3aleaves 3anitrogen fertilizers 0anitrogen stress 0along-term experiment 0adevelopmental stages 0aplant growth analysis 0amaize 0agrowth parameters0 tActa agronomica Academiae Scientiarum Hungaricae.g2009 Sept. 1, v. 57, no. 3 p.267-276dAkadémiai Kiadóx0238-01617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1556%2FAAgr.57.2009.3.23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03036naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002200138245016500160300001800325500002000343520143400363592002801797650002001825650002901845650002501874650001701899650001601916650003601932650001901968650002301987650001102010650002202021650002602043650001602069650001702085650001302102650001502115700006402130700006302194700002602257700002302283700002202306700002002328773012502348856007202473852000902545655001202554IND60751358320221121103123.0210924e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075135832DNAL7 a10.1002/ptr.72012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMuscarà, Claudia10aPhytochemical characterization and biological properties of two standardized extracts from a non‐psychotropic Cannabis sativa L. cannabidiol (CBD)‐chemotype  ap. 5269-5281.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe aim of study was to evaluate and compare the phytochemical profile, the antioxidant and antimicrobial properties of two standardized extracts from non‐psychotropic (Δ⁹‐tetrahydrocannabinol ≤0.2%) Cannabis sativa L. var. fibrante rich in cannabidiol (CBD). The two extracts, namely Cannabis Fibrante Hexane Extract 1 (CFHE1) and Cannabis Fibrante Hexane Extract 2 (CFHE2), were obtained by extraction with acidified hexane from dried flowering tops as such and after hydrodistillation of the essential oil, respectively. Gas chromatographic analysis showed that cannabinoids remained the predominant class of compounds in both extracts (82.56% and 86.38%, respectively), whereas a marked depletion of the terpenes occurred. Moreover, liquid chromatographic analysis highlighted a high titer of cannabidiol acid (CBDA) and CBD in CFHE1 and CFHE2, respectively. Both extracts showed a strong and concentration‐dependent antioxidant activity and a potent antimicrobial activity against both Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538 (MIC and MBC of 4.88 μg/ml for CFHE1, and 4.88 and 19.53 μg/ml, respectively, for CFHE2) and methicillin resistant clinical strains (MIC values between 1.22 and 9.77 μg/ml and MBC values between 4.88 and 78.13 μg/ml). Considering this, the obtained results suggest that standardized extracts of C. sativa var. fibrante could find promising applications as novel antimicrobial agents.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCannabis sativa 3aantimicrobial properties 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3acannabidiol 3achemical constituents of plants 3aessential oils 3agas chromatography 3ahexane 3ahydrodistillation 3aliquid chromatography 3amethicillin 3aphytotherapy 3aresearch 3aterpenoids1 aSmeriglio, Antonella1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9756-304X1 aTrombetta, Domenico1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4358-52241 aMandalari, Giuseppina1 aLa Camera, Erminia1 aGrassi, Gianpaolo1 aCircosta, Clara0 tPhytotherapy research.g2021 Sept., v. 35, no. 9 p.5269-5281dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.wJournal:jnl47440x0951-418X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ptr.72013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02004naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245013900166300001800305520071600323592002801039650002201067650001301089650002301102650002301125650001101148650002501159650004401184650002001228650001801248653000801266653002601274653004201300653001301342653002701355700001901382773011201401856008401513852000901597655001201606IND60599502220221118104225.0180702e20140806xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059950222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2014.06.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRam, Ram N.13aAn evidence of contact ion pair in β-(acyloxy)alkyl radical heterolysis during copper(I)-mediated synthesis of trisubstituted alkenes  ap. 4448-4451.  aThe first evidence for a unified mechanism of heterolysis in β-(acyloxy)alkyl radical involving contact ion pair (CIP) is presented for both fragmentation and rearrangement of the acyloxy group in the reaction of 1-alkoxy-2,2,2-trichloroethyl acetate with 2molequiv each of CuCl and bpy in refluxing DCE under a N2 atmosphere and availed this reaction for the synthesis of Z-stereoselective trisubstituted alkenes. The stereochemistry of the trisubstituted alkenes was assigned by the uniform pattern of the chemical shift values of some relevant signals in ¹H and ¹³C NMR spectra.

Methods: A total of 1,015 canine serum samples were randomly selected from submissions to a diagnostic laboratory between March and December 2014, and were analysed for CRCoV antibodies using a competitive ELISA. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine associations between seroprevalence of CRCoV and breed category, age, sex, sampling month, region, and reported health status of dogs. Results: Overall, 538/1,015 (53.0%) samples were seropositive for CRCoV, with 492/921 (53.4%) positive dogs in the North Island and 46/94 (49%) in the South Island. Age of dog, sampling month, region, and presence of abnormal respiratory signs were included in the initial logistic regression model. Seroprevalence was higher in dogs aged ≥3 compared with ≤2 years (p < 0.01). The lowest seroprevalence was observed in July (30/105; 28.5%) and August (32/100; 32%), and the highest in June (74/100; 74%). Seroprevalence in dogs from Auckland was higher than in dogs from the Hawkes Bay, Manawatu, Marlborough, and Waikato regions (p < 0.05). Abnormal respiratory signs (coughing, nasal discharge, or sneezing) were reported for 28/1,015 (2.8%) dogs sampled. Seroprevalence for CRCoV tended to be higher among dogs with respiratory signs (67.9 (95% CI = 47.6–83.4)%) than dogs with no reported respiratory signs (52.6 (95% CI = 49.5–55.7)%). Conclusions: Serological evidence of infection with CRCoV was present in more than half of the dogs tested from throughout New Zealand. Differences in CRCoV seroprevalence between regions and lack of seasonal pattern indicate that factors other than external temperatures may be important in the epidemiology of CRCoV in New Zealand. Clinical relevance: Our data suggest that CRCoV should be included in investigations of cases of infectious canine tracheobronchitis, particularly if these occur among dogs vaccinated with current vaccines, which do not include CRCoV antigens.  aThe study was partly funded by the New Zealand Greyhound Association.  aPublisher supplied data  cNew Zealand Greyhound Association0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aOrthocoronavirinae 3aantibodies 3aantigens 3ablood serum 3adog diseases 3adogs 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3ahealth status 3anose 3aregression analysis 3arespiratory tract diseases 3aseasonal variation 3aserological surveys 3aseroprevalence 3asigns and symptoms (animals and humans) 3atemperature 3avaccines 3aNew Zealand 0aCanine respiratory coronavirus 0aELISA 0asurvey1 aDunowska, M1 aAcke, E1 aCave, NJ0 tNew Zealand veterinary journal.g2020 Jan. 2, v. 68, no. 1 p.54-59dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12298x1176-07107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00480169.2019.16672823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02198naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002700140245009500167520117200262592002801434650001101462650002001473650001501493650002201508650002301530650001701553651001301570700003301583700002101616700002501637773012701662856007401789852000901863655001201872IND60652357620221118022035.0190712e20180717xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065235762DNAL7 a10.3390/su100725012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarros, José  Leandro10aPeri-Urbanization and Rurbanization in Leiria City: the Importance of a Planning Framework  aThe objective of this study is to evaluate the spatial and temporal dynamics of land use in the city of Leiria, which is located in central Portugal, and its relation to the planning framework. The analysis is based on land-use change recognition in the period 1958&ndash;2011, calculation of the stability grade indicator, the losses and gains between classes, and the rate of artificialization. The results show an increase of the artificial areas, namely in continuous and discontinuous urban fabric, contrasting with a continuous decrease of the agricultural land-use classes, giving origin to peri-urbanization and rurbanization processes. We can also observe a large fragmentation of the landscape in the city of Leiria, representing rapid urban expansion that is fundamentally related to the increase of residential and industrial areas, and afterwards, tertiary growth. This study also demonstrated the relation of a land-use and planning framework that works as a driving force for land-use changes. This underlines the importance of strategic regional planning instruments in managing urban sprawl and the artificialization processes of medium-sized cities.  aPublisher supplied data 3acities 3aland use change 3alandscapes 3aregional planning 3atemporal variation 3aurbanization 3aPortugal1 aTavares, Alexandre  Oliveira1 aMonteiro, Mário1 aSantos, Pedro  Pinto0 tSustainability.g2018 July 17, v. 10, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su100725013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02849naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245012400171300001800295520164100313592002801954650002501982650001302007650003002020650001502050650002302065650001102088650001302099650001902112650000702131650001502138650001602153650001102169700001702180700001602197700002302213773012502236856008102361852000902442655001202451IND60601071620221119193202.0180705e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060107162DNAL7 a10.1007/s12649-017-9876-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVarma, V. Sudharsan10aEffects of Aeration During Pile Composting of Water Hyacinth Operated at Agitated, Passive and Forced Aerated Condition  ap. 1339-1347.  aPURPOSE: The increasing invasion of water hyacinth is creating major environmental problems in water and after disposal also. Hence, composting of water hyacinth was studied for its degradation pattern. The effects of aeration and mixing of the composting materials were correlated during pile composting of water hyacinth operated at different aeration conditions. METHODS: Trial 1 was operated in agitated mode, trial 2 in passive mode and trials 3 and 4 through forced aerated conditions with different interval of aeration. The pile composting was operated for 30 days and the changes in temperature and pH pattern, volatile solids reduction and nitrogen transformation were correlated with different operated piles. RESULTS: Due to proper combination of waste materials and higher microbial activity a maximum of 52, 55, 51 and 48.5 °C was observed in trials 1, 2, 3 and 4 respectively. The rate of aeration to the composting materials was found critical in maintaining the thermophilic temperatures and higher degradation of organic matter in the composting system. Trial 2 operated in passive mode was observed with a maximum of 32.3% volatile solids reduction followed by 27.6, 20.4 and 14.2% in trials 1, 3 and 4, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Due to appropriate combination of waste materials and proper composting, higher degradation of water hyacinth was observed in trial 2. Nitrogen and phosphorus content was observed to increase towards the end of composting. In addition, due to higher degradation of organic matter, lower OUR and CO₂ evolution rates were observed, indicating the stability of compost within 30 days.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEichhornia crassipes 3aaeration 3acarbon dioxide production 3acomposting 3amicrobial activity 3amixing 3anitrogen 3aorganic matter 3apH 3aphosphorus 3atemperature 3awastes1 aPrasad, Ravi1 aDeb, Shampa1 aKalamdhad, Ajay S.0 tWaste and biomass valorization.g2018 Aug., v. 9, no. 8 p.1339-1347dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:6304x1877-26417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12649-017-9876-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02953naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245009700159520165300256592002801909650001901937650002501956650001101981650001501992650002502007650001102032650002202043650001002065650001002075650002702085650001902112650002702131650001302158650003302171650001402204650001402218650001602232650002102248650001102269650001702280773012702297856007402424852000902498655001202507IND60652357720221118022012.0190712e20180717xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065235772DNAL7 a10.3390/su100725032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTang, Chao-Wei10aProperties of Fired Bricks Incorporating TFT-LCD Waste Glass Powder with Reservoir Sediments  aIn view of increasing concerns over nonrenewable resource depletion and waste management, this study aimed to apply the Taguchi optimization technique to determine the process conditions for producing bricks by incorporating thin-film transition liquid crystal display (TFT-LCD) waste glass powder with reservoir sediments. An orthogonal array L<inf>16</inf>(45) was adopted, which consisted of five controllable four-level factors (i.e., cullet content, drying method, preheat time, sintering temperature, and error). Moreover, the analysis of variance method was used to explore the effects of the experimental factors on the density, water absorption, shrinkage ratio, loss on ignition, porosity, and compressive strength of the fired bricks. The microstructures of the fired specimens were investigated by scanning electron microscopy. Then, large-scale production techniques for fired bricks containing recycled TFT-LCD glass cullet and reservoir sediments were developed in a commercially available tunnel kiln. The test results showed that the structure of the fired specimen was loose at a sintering temperature ranging from 900 to 950 &deg;C. However, the fired specimen showed a significant densification at the sintering temperature of 1050 &deg;C. In addition, the Taguchi method was found to be a feasible approach for optimizing the process condition of bricks using recycled TFT-LCD glass cullet and reservoir sediments and it significantly reduced the number of tests. Further, the characteristics of fired bricks developed in the tunnel kiln were in compliance with Chinese National Standards class &Iota; building bricks criteria.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTaguchi method 3aanalysis of variance 3abricks 3acompliance 3acompression strength 3adrying 3afilms (materials) 3aglass 3akilns 3aliquid crystal display 3amicrostructure 3anonrenewable resources 3aporosity 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asediments 3ashrinkage 3atemperature 3awaste management 3awastes 3awater uptake0 tSustainability.g2018 July 17, v. 10, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su100725033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02560naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245009400165300001800259520032500277592002800602650001600630650001200646650002300658650002300681650001100704650002100715650002200736650001400758650002100772650001400793653003200807653003200839653003200871653003200903653003200935653003200967653003200999653003201031653003201063653003201095653003201127653003201159653003201191653003201223653003201255653003201287653003201319653003201351653003201383653003201415653003201447653002501479653003001504653001201534653002001546653001101566700001501577700001301592700001401605700001301619700001301632773011201645856008401757852000901841655001201850IND60599502420221118103525.0180702e20140723xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059950242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2014.06.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheng, Jie10aElectrophile-driven copper-catalyzed one-pot synthesis of 3-halogen quinoline derivatives  ap. 4044-4046.  aA convenient and regioselective one-pot synthesis of 3-chloride or 3-bromide quinoline derivatives was achieved through a Grignard addition reaction by alkynyl Grignard regent to o-trifluoroacetyl aniline and a Cu(II)-catalyzed cyclization–halogenation tandem reaction with aqueous HCl or HBr as electrophilic reagent.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLewis acids 3aaniline 3achemical reactions 3achemical structure 3acopper 3ahydrobromic acid 3ahydrochloric acid 3aquinoline 3aregioselectivity 3asynthesis 0aGBAGYKNRWWPLLD-UHFFFAOYSA-N 0aAHURFDBRXAZEFK-UHFFFAOYSA-N 0aNFOPILKGLNQHQI-UHFFFAOYSA-N 0aCGNMAWGLGRPYOD-UHFFFAOYSA-N 0aOAFYCYQBXPHNBY-UHFFFAOYSA-N 0aBOJQCXUOVMOADW-UHFFFAOYSA-N 0aRAJHHECFEIQZHO-UHFFFAOYSA-N 0aZVCMHQQFNNCZGB-UHFFFAOYSA-N 0aWCOJREYSWPTJAG-UHFFFAOYSA-N 0aMPCWBUZSUZBFNI-UHFFFAOYSA-N 0aQYVHMCBEHHYDJO-UHFFFAOYSA-N 0aISRMCGNCJYBKKG-UHFFFAOYSA-N 0aFRDCRBGJJKUOEW-UHFFFAOYSA-N 0aPKOUQRSJLLXDEN-UHFFFAOYSA-N 0aWPHUWEOHGOQJSC-UHFFFAOYSA-N 0aQYQOZVNVSJFWAM-UHFFFAOYSA-N 0aKEKNIFPBQKXLMM-UHFFFAOYSA-N 0aWWGCZFPWGRUBGZ-UHFFFAOYSA-N 0aLIEHJMIGOGBZDT-UHFFFAOYSA-N 0aHCNZAAVGLGDUMO-UHFFFAOYSA-N 0aVTLCCRSEJLGBIC-UHFFFAOYSA-N 0a3-Halogen quinolines 0ao-Trifluoroacetyl aniline 0aOne-pot 0aTandem reaction 0aCopper1 aZhai, Hong1 aBai, Jun1 aTang, Jun1 aLv, Ling1 aSun, Bei0 tTetrahedron letters.g2014 July 23, v. 55, no. 30 p.4044-4046dElsevier LtdwJournal:11745x0040-40397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tetlet.2014.06.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02834naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245010700167300001400274520157900288592002801867650001401895650001101909650002101920650001001941650002501951650000901976650001001985650001501995650001202010650001302022650000902035650001102044653002102055653003602076653001702112653002202129700001502151700001902166773012102185856008502306852000902391655001202400IND60676936120221118162547.0191122e20200102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067693612DNAL7 a10.1080/00480169.2019.16701152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStilwell, G10aPotential benefit of a thoracic squeeze technique in two newborn calves delivered by caesarean section  ap. 65-68.  aCase History: Two calves delivered following elective caesarean section showed behaviour typical of neonatal maladjustment syndrome described in foals, i.e., indifference to environmental stimuli, lack of affinity for the dam, failure to find the udder, refusal to suck, aimless wandering or motionless standing. Calves were subjected to a clinical examination immediate after delivery and there were no signs of defects, illness, pain, dehydration, hypoxia, acidaemia or other causes for the unresponsive behaviour. Clinical Findings and Treatment: Both calves were subjected to the thoracic squeeze technique, one at 6 hours and the other at 20 hours after delivery. A soft rope was looped around the thorax and gentle pressure was applied to the free end of the rope, squeezing the calf’s chest for 20 minutes. Both calves exhibited a sleep-like state manifested by closed eyes, no body movements, slow breathing and a decrease in heart rate, for the entire squeezing period. When the rope was removed the calves woke up immediately, rose and walked towards the dam. When led to the dam’s udder, the weaker calf began to suck. Both were reported, by the stockperson, to follow the dam and suck normally the following day. Clinical Relevance: Provided all other disease processes are excluded, very young calves that exhibit indifference to environmental stimuli and lack of affinity for the dam may be good candidates for application of the thoracic squeeze technique that has been demonstrated to have clinical efficacy in foals with neonatal maladjustment syndrome.  aPublisher supplied data 3abreathing 3acalves 3acesarean section 3achest 3aclinical examination 3aeyes 3afoals 3aheart rate 3ahypoxia 3aneonates 3apain 3audders 0aThoracic squeeze 0aneonatal maladjustment syndrome 0adummy calves 0acaesarean section1 aMellor, DJ1 aHoldsworth, SE0 tNew Zealand veterinary journal.g2020 Jan. 2, v. 68, no. 1 p.65-68dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12298x1176-07107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00480169.2019.16701153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02856naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006000147245012000207300001800327520139900345592002801744596004001772650001001812650001801822650001201840650002101852650001201873650003001885650001801915650003101933650001201964650002801976650000702004650001402011650001302025650001202038650001002050650000902060700002102069700001902090700001802109700001602127700001602143773012502159856008102284852000902365655001202374IND60601071720221119193155.0180705e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060107172DNAL7 a10.1007/s12649-017-9910-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKeskinen, Riikka1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4025-637X10aPossibilities of Using Liquids from Slow Pyrolysis and Hydrothermal Carbonization in Acidification of Animal Slurry  ap. 1429-1433.  aPyrolysis and hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) are gaining increasing interest in the context of biomass valorization. However, these processes yield a liquid fraction with an acidic pH value challenging to productize. In this paper, the possibility of replacing concentrated acids in acidification of animal slurry with organic acids derived from thermochemical conversion of various biomasses was investigated. The acid composition of four pyrolysis and one HTC liquid fraction were characterized using capillary electrophoresis and their total acidity determined titrimetrically. The amount of each liquid needed to reduce the pH of pig and cattle slurries to 6.0 and 5.5 were recorded. The total acidity of pyrolysis liquids varied highly (850–2560 meq l⁻¹) depending on the biomass. For HTC liquid the total acidity was low (220 meq l⁻¹). The most concentrated liquid, which showed greatest potential for practical use, was derived from pyrolysis of willow wood. Its required application rate for decreasing the pH of the slurries from >7.5 to 6.0 was 20–50 l t⁻¹. This study suggests that there is a possibility of using liquids from pyrolysis process for acidification of animal slurries. Producing more concentrated liquids, further concentration of these acidiferous streams and the effects of the liquid addition on the properties of slurry are worth further studying.  aPublisher supplied data  a637020 −MOBILE FLIPcHorizon 2020 3aSalix 3aacidification 3aacidity 3aapplication rate 3abiomass 3acapillary electrophoresis 3acattle manure 3ahydrothermal carbonization 3aliquids 3aorganic acids and salts 3apH 3apyrolysis 3aslurries 3astreams 3aswine 3awood1 aHyväluoma, Jari1 aWikberg, Hanne1 aKälli, Anssi1 aSalo, Tapio1 aRasa, Kimmo0 tWaste and biomass valorization.g2018 Aug., v. 9, no. 8 p.1429-1433dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:6304x1877-26417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12649-017-9910-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01997naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245010200153520110400255592002801359650001701387650001901404650001901423650001201442651001001454651001901464700001401483773012701497856007401624852000901698655001201707IND60652357820221118021956.0190712e20180717xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065235782DNAL7 a10.3390/su100725042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRen, Wei10aIndicators for Assessing the Sustainability of Built Heritage Attractions: An Anglo-Chinese Study  aAlthough sustainability is now a well-established concept, it is less well-established in the management of built heritage attractions. This paper reports research on the application of sustainability indicators for built heritage attractions, as a means to advance a more holistic sustainability assessment approach for the management of this important type of attraction. The research employed a questionnaire-based survey and four case studies designed to provide information concerning sustainability assessment for a substantial sample of built heritage attractions in both the UK and China. It seeks to identify the dimensions of sustainability for such attractions through a consideration of relevant sustainability indicators. The research findings indicate important variations in terms of the importance of key sustainable indicators between the UK and China. The results also provide pointers as to how the set of indicators might be developed further to provide a more holistic and measurable appraisal method to assess the sustainability of the management of built heritage attractions.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3ahistoric sites 3aquestionnaires 3asurveys 3aChina 3aUnited Kingdom1 aHan, Feng0 tSustainability.g2018 July 17, v. 10, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su100725043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02719naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245014900169300001800318520125200336592002801588650002001616650001901636650002201655650002901677650002001706650002101726650002301747650002201770650000701792650001401799650001101813650001901824650001601843650001501859650001801874700002601892700001601918700001701934700002301951700002701974700003302001773012502034856008102159852000902240655001202249IND60601071820221119193422.0180705e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060107182DNAL7 a10.1007/s12649-017-9912-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarman, Prasenjit10aCharacterization and Strain Improvement of Aerobic Denitrifying EPS Producing Bacterium Bacillus cereus PB88 for Shrimp Water Quality Management  ap. 1319-1330.  aA bacterial strain PB88 was isolated from intensive shrimp culture pond to study the denitrification process. On the basis of 16S rDNA analysis, strain PB88 was identified as Bacillus cereus PB88. It has the potential to remove 82.33 ± 3.24% [Formula: see text]in synthetic medium. The optimum pH, temperature and dissolved oxygen for the highest denitrification process of the PB88 were 8.0, 30 °C and 5.21 mg/l (150 rpm) respectively. PB88 harbour the genetic sequence of nitrite reductase (nirS) enzyme which is essential to complete aerobic denitrification process. One remarkable finding is that the experimental organism produced exopolysaccharide (EPS) during the denitrification process and EPS has the antibacterial property against shrimp pathogen Vibrio harveyi MTCC 7954 (inhibition zone of 5.21 mm) and Vibrio vulnificus MTCC 1145 (inhibition zone of 7.11 mm). Removal of [Formula: see text] in open base shrimp wastewater system were recorded as 98.51% by B. cereus PB88 and average shrimp body weight gained in treated system as 6 ± 0.54 to 8 ± 0.74 g within 7 days. Overall result indicated that B. cereus PB88 has the immense potential for the application in commercial shrimp culture as denitrifying agent.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus cereus 3aVibrio harveyi 3aVibrio vulnificus 3aantibacterial properties 3adenitrification 3adissolved oxygen 3aexopolysaccharides 3anitrite reductase 3apH 3apathogens 3ashrimp 3ashrimp culture 3atemperature 3awastewater 3awater quality1 aBandyopadhyay, Partha1 aKati, Ahmet1 aPaul, Tanmay1 aMandal, Amit Kumar1 aMondal, Keshab Chandra1 aMohapatra, Pradeep Kumar Das0 tWaste and biomass valorization.g2018 Aug., v. 9, no. 8 p.1319-1330dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:6304x1877-26417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12649-017-9912-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03173naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005800148245017400206300002000380500001900400520165900419592002802078650001202106650002002118650002402138650002902162650002502191650002202216650001502238650001302253650002602266650001402292650001302306650001502319650002102334650001202355651001002367651001302377700001902390700001902409700002502428773017002453856008302623852000902706655001202715IND60706986020221118042019.0200819e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070698602DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-020-09553-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMannu, Roberto1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0693-094912aA multidiversity approach to investigate the impact of mining exploitation on spider diversity in the abandoned mine district of Montevecchio-Ingurtosu (Sardinia, Italy)  ap. 32615-32627.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe impact of mining activities on spider (Araneae) diversity and assemblages was studied in two abandoned mine sites in Sardinia (Italy), where mining activities started in the middle of the nineteenth century and closed down over a century later. Spider community composition was analysed in dumps, undisturbed forests and scrublands which represent the natural chronosequence following the abandonment of the mining district. The identification of spiders was performed at the lowest taxonomic level possible and differences in abundance, species richness (SR), and functional diversity (FD) were analysed. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) and a permutated multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) routine were conducted to evaluate the relationships of spider assemblages with land cover, and the indicator species analysis was performed to identify the typifying species. During the entire sampling period, 2312 spiders were captured, and approximately 80% of the total were identified at the species level (79 spider species belonging to 28 different families). No differences in abundance and SR were found, whereas FD, which showed the highest values in forests, significantly differed among sites. A distinct separation among assemblages and a significant effect of the land use on spider assemblages were found (PERMANOVA, R² = 0.59, p < 0.001). Twelve species were selected as indicator species. Our results underlined the possibility to consider ground-dwelling spiders as a valuable target group for biomonitoring programmes supporting projects of near-natural restoration and/or technical reclamation of mining sites.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAraneae 3achronosequences 3acommunity structure 3aenvironmental monitoring 3afunctional diversity 3aindicator species 3aland cover 3aland use 3amultivariate analysis 3apollution 3aresearch 3ashrublands 3aspecies richness 3aspiders 3aItaly 3aSardinia1 aPantini, Paolo1 aSassu, Antonio1 aVerdinelli, Marcello0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2020 Sept., v. 27, no. 26 p.32615-32627dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-09553-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02631naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245012200170300001600292520103300308536023801341592002801579596010701607596010801714653001101822653001501833653000801848653002501856653002001881700001401901700001701915700001701932700001501949700001901964700001601983773015101999856008602150852000902236655001202245IND60676936320221118162607.0200327e20190703xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067693632DNAL7 a10.1080/01140671.2019.15767442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Dongxue10aEffect of thidiazuron on morphological and flowering characteristics of Dendrobium ‘Sunya Sunshine’ potted plants  ap. 170-181.  aDendrobium is a kind of popular orchid with long display life of flowers. Since it has a long vegetative period to flowering, it is necessary to develop methods to promote flowering. The effects of thidiazuron (TDZ) on flowering and the morphological characteristics of the Dendrobium ‘Sunya Sunshine’ were investigated. One-year-old and uniform height potted plants were used. Plants were spayed and root irrigated with the same amount of TDZ solution in different concentration treatments. The results showed that TDZ promoted the emergence of new shoots, but it did not affect plant morphology, such as the stem height, stem diameter, leaf size. TDZ application of 30 mg·L⁻¹ increased the floral bud formation rate to 87.1%, increased inflorescence number and stalk thickness, but it also decreased the flower number per inflorescence and flower size, and shortened the flowering duration. This study indicated that TDZ could promote flowering, and the optimum concentration of the TDZ solution was 30 mg·L⁻¹.  aThis work was supported by the Natural Science Foundation of Hainan Province [grant number 317262, 20163131]; the National Nonproﬁt Institute Research Grant of CATAS-TCGRI [grant number 1630032017079, 1630032015038, 1630032017024].  aPublisher supplied data  a317262a20163131cNatural Science Foundation of Hainan Provincedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100004761  a1630032017079a1630032015038a1630032017024cNational Nonprofit Institute Research Grant of CATAS-TCGRI 0aOrchid 0adendrobium 0aTDZ 0afloral bud formation 0aearly flowering1 aLIao, Yi,1 aLu, Shunjiao1 aLi, Chonghui1 aShen, Zhen1 aYang, Guangsui1 aYin, Junmei0 tNew Zealand journal of crop and horticultural science.g2019 July 3, v. 47, no. 3 p.170-181dTaylor & FranciswJournal:J000000127x1175-87837nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01140671.2019.15767443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02617naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002200188245013300210300001800343506007600361520127800437592002801715506003701743650002301780650001801803650002001821650001401841650002001855650001501875650002001890650000901910650001301919650001601932650001601948650000901964700001701973773011501990856008102105852000902186655001202195IND60586050920221207123827.0171115e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058605092DNAL7 a10.1007/s13197-017-2911-22doi7 aPMC56860182pmcid7 a291842442pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKrishnan, Rateesh10aAssessment of inhibitory factors on bioaccessibility of iron and zinc in pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum (L.)

The results indicated that iron and zinc contents ranged between 5.59–13.41 and 2.11–5.19 mg/100 g. Polyphenols, flavonoids and phytic acid were highest in GHB744 (781 mg/100 g), HHB223 (116 mg/100 g) and HHB226 (1.080 g/100 g) respectively. Insoluble fiber content range from 9.36 to 12.89 g/100 g. Iron and zinc bioaccessibility was the highest in local Anantapur (17.95%) and GHB744 (15.19%) cultivar with low phytic acid. HHB226 exhibited high β-carotene and phytase activity. In this study, the cultivars with high iron and zinc content also possessed high inhibitory factors which affected bioaccessibility. However, the bioaccessibility of iron did not seem to depend on the phytic acid: iron ratio alone. Further, a trend was observed in cultivars with low iron: zinc ratio had increased iron bioaccessibility. On the contrary, phytic acid: zinc ratio appears to play a significant role in zinc bioaccessibility. Certain cultivars with high iron content also had high phytase activity and β-carotene content which could be exploited for further technological treatments to enhance the bioaccessibility of iron and zinc.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPennisetum glaucum 3abeta-carotene 3abioavailability 3acultivars 3aenzyme activity 3aflavonoids 3ainsoluble fiber 3airon 3aphytases 3aphytic acid 3apolyphenols 3azinc1 aMeera, M.

However, diminishing physical reserves of potash salts and high-price volatility of potassium chloride, the main source of K to agricultural soils, has raised concerns about a K scarcity scenario, mainly in countries that depend on fertilizer imports to sustain its production. In this context, Brazil is one of the main agricultural producers in the world, having a major role in the global K flows, since the country sustains its production by a high consumption of imported K fertilizers. In order to seek opportunities to contribute to a more sustainable management of K resources, tools such as the material flow analysis (MFA) can be used to highlight the main K stocks and flows in a country scale, and identify options for reuse and recycle. This study proposed a MFA of K for Brazil, considering the base-year 2013. A total of forty-four flows and seven stocks were identified and quantified considering nine main processes related to human activity. According to the results, for the year of study, the main inputs of K in Brazil were in the form of fertilizers (4.1 × 10³ Gg of K per year), and the main outputs were in the form of grain exports (9.1 × 10² Gg of K per year). Agricultural soils were the main stock for K in the country, and from the total flow of 7.3 × 10³ Gg of K per year applied to soils, 67% came out as agricultural products, 13% was lost through erosion and leaching, and 20% remained in the soils. The flow of K actually consumed by the Brazilian population was 3.5 × 10² Gg of K per year, just 8.4% of the total food produced in the country. About 1.9 × 10³ Gg of K per year has been lost to the environment in sewage streams and solid landfill waste. Prospects for more sustainable K management in the country are identified and discussed.  aPublisher supplied data  a88882.460380/2019-01cCoordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior 3aagricultural productivity 3afood security 3ahumans 3alandfills 3amaterial flow analysis 3anitrogen 3aphosphorus 3apollution 3apotassium 3apotassium chloride 3aresearch 3asewage 3aBrazil1 aCohim, Eduardo1 ado Nascimento, Francisco Ramon Alves0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2020 Sept., v. 27, no. 26 p.32579-32593dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-09526-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04263naa a2200793 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100001800169245017800187300001600365520181200381592002802193650001402221650001702235650001302252650002002265650001502285650001702300650000902317650001502326650001502341650001002356650000902366650001502375650000902390650002602399650001802425650002902443650001202472650003502484650001602519650004102535650004002576650002902616650001102645650004902656650002302705650002102728650003102749650003202780650003102812650003402843650004802877650001502925650002902940650002502969650003902994651001003033653003203043653003003075653002603105653000903131700001703140700001903157700001603176700001603192700001803208700001803226700001703244700002403261773011203285856005103397852000903448655001203457IND50087200320221119231743.0140412e20110501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008720032DNAL7 a215981432pmid7 a10.1080/19440049.2011.5633672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Fengmei10aMulti-residue method for the confirmation of four avermectin residues in food products of animal origin by ultra-performance liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry  ap. 627-639.  aA confirmatory method was developed for the rapid determination of abamectin, ivermectin, doramectin and eprinomectin residues in various food products of animal origin, such as pork muscle, pork liver, fish and milk. Samples were homogenized, extracted and de-proteinized by acetonitrile, cleaned via two-step cleaning procedure using Bond Elut C₁₈ SPE columns and then alumina-N cartridges. All the four avermectin residues in different animal-food products were simultaneously separated and determined by ultra-performance liquid chromatography–electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC–ESI–MS/MS) within 3.5 min. Data acquisition under positive ESI–MS/MS was performed by applying multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) for both identification and quantification, and mass spectrometric conditions were optimized to increase selectivity and sensitivity. The matrix-matched calibration curves for different matrices, such as pork muscle, pork liver, fish and milk, were constructed and the interference effect of different sample matrices on the ionization was effectively eliminated. The UPLC–MS/MS method was validated with satisfactory linearity, recovery, precision and stability. Matrix-matched calibration curves of abamectin, ivermectin, doramectin and eprinomectin in four different matrices were linear (r² ≥ 0.990, goodness-of-fit coefficients ≤12.8%) in the range 2.5–200 µg kg⁻¹. The limits of detection and quantification for the four avermectins were in the range 0.05–0.68 and 0.17–2.27 µg kg⁻¹, respectively. Recoveries were 62.4–104.5% with good intra- and inter-day precision. The method was rapid, sensitive and reliable, and can be applied to the quantitative analysis of avermectin residues in different animal-food products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabamectin 3aacetonitrile 3acleaning 3adetection limit 3adoramectin 3aeprinomectin 3afish 3aionization 3aivermectin 3aliver 3amilk 3amonitoring 3apork 3aquantitative analysis 3arapid methods 3atandem mass spectrometry 2aAnimals 2aAntiparasitic Agentsxanalysis 2aCalibration 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquid 2aDrug Residuesxanalysisxstandards. 2aFood Inspectionxmethods 2aHumans 2aIvermectinxanalogs & derivativesxanalysis. 2aLimit of Detection 2aLiverxchemistry 2aMeatxanalysisxstandards. 2aMilkxchemistryxstandards. 2aReproducibility of Results 2aSeafoodxanalysisxstandards. 2aSpectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization 2aSus scrofa 2aTandem Mass Spectrometry 2aTeratogensxanalysis 2aVeterinary Drugsxanalysisxblood. 0aChina 0achromatography, HPLC, LC/MS 0adrug residues, ivermectin 0aanimal products, meat 0amilk1 aChen, Junhui1 aCheng, Hongyan1 aTang, Zhixu1 aZhang, Gang1 aNiu, Zengyuan1 aPang, Shiping1 aWang, Xiaoru1 aLee, Frank Sen-Chun0 tFood additives & contaminants.g2011 May 1, v. 28, no. 5 p.627-639dTaylor & Francis Groupx1944-00577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/19440049.2011.563367  aDNAL 7aarticle04800naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002300153245012700176300001400303500001500317520310700332592002803439650001503467650002103482650002303503650002403526650001303550650002003563650001103583650001103594650001203605650002503617650001503642650001203657650001103669650001503680650001503695650002203710650001203732650001503744650001503759650001903774650001903793650000903812650002203821651001003843653001203853653001403865653001703879653001503896653002203911653001803933653001103951700002203962773010503984856008804089852000904177655001204186IND60525814620221120204757.0190319e20160610xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052581462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2016.02.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKing, Elizabeth G.10aCombining ecohydrologic and transition probability-based modeling to simulate vegetation dynamics in a semi-arid rangeland  ap. 41-63.  a2019-12-06  aDrylands support pastoralist social–ecological systems around the world. Ecological function in these water-limited environments frequently depends on tightly coupled, nonlinear interactions between water, soil, vegetation, and herbivores. Numerous complexity-based approaches have modeled localized ecohydrological feedbacks to yield insights into dryland landscape organization and emergent dynamics. The relevance of these models to management and sustainability continues to increase as researchers incorporate ecological processes at multiple scales and social–ecological variables like herding practices. However, many processes vary in their importance depending on ecological context, so there is a continuing need to construct models tailored to different contexts. We developed a model for semi-arid rangelands that experience highly variable rainfall, substantial Hortonian runoff during rain events, patchy vegetation structure, and grazing-influenced patch transitions. The model couples an existing, mechanistic cellular automata model of hillslope water balance with a dynamic vegetation model in which probabilistic transitions between bare, annual grass, perennial grass patches depend on soil moisture and grazing intensity. The model was parameterized based on a field site in Kenya, from which we had empirical hydrological measurements and several years of patch-to-hillslope scale measurements of vegetation structure. The model domain is a 100×100 grid of 2×2m cells, it simulates seasonal cycles of growing seasons followed by dry seasons, and it computes daily soil moisture based on stochastic rainfall forcings. Patch type transitions can occur twice during each seasonal cycle: at the end of the growing season, with probabilities based on average growing-season soil moisture availability; and at the end of the dry season, with probabilities based on grazing intensity and antecedent growing-season soil moisture. By parameterizing grazing intensity as a per-patch impact, it can be interpreted as the degree of forage depletion at which a herder decides to leave the area. We conducted a series of simulation experiments, principally altering runoff channelization and grazing intensity. The model generated plausible vegetation dynamics across the range of grazing intensities simulated. Vegetation cover fluctuated seasonally, but never collapsed completely, even at the highest grazing intensity. At low to intermediate grazing, we observed multi-decadal switches in fractional perennial cover, triggered by periods of below- or above-average rainfall. At low to intermediate grazing intensities, we noted emergent spatial patterning in the form of a step-like increase in vegetation density in the lower half of the domain. With a vegetation patch transitions governed by mechanistic water balance dynamics as well as grazing intensities that represent herder decision-making, the model holds great potential for further explorations of how land use, climate, and spatial heterogeneity affect the functioning of a dryland pastoralist social–ecological system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarid lands 3avegetation cover 3aseasonal variation 3aecological function 3aland use 3adecision making 3aforage 3arunoff 3aclimate 3avegetation structure 3adry season 3agrasses 3amodels 3aherbivores 3asoil water 3aspatial variation 3aherding 3arangelands 3alandscapes 3achannelization 3agrowing season 3arain 3agrazing intensity 3aKenya 0aGrazing 0aSemi-arid 0aEcohydrology 0aTransition 0aCellular automata 0awater balance 0aRunoff1 aFranz, Trenton E.0 tEcological modelling.g2016 June 10, v. 329 p.41-63dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl6191x0304-38007nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2016.02.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01459naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002300153245013100176300001400307520037300321592002800694650001700722650001100739650002400750650001500774653002400789653002900813653001700842653004600859700002700905773010400932856008801036852000901124655001201133IND60525814720221120194308.0190319e20160524xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052581472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2016.02.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBartsev, Sergey I.14aThe vertical distribution of soil organic matter predicted by a simple continuous model of soil organic matter transformations  ap. 95-98.  aNew modification of the simple continuous model of soil organic matter (SOM) transformation is proposed.

The inverse probability weighted (IPW) estimators are a primary tool for estimating the average treatment effect but the large variance of these estimators is often a significant concern for their reliable use in practice. Inspired by Rao‐Blackwellization, this paper proposes a method to smooth an IPW estimator by replacing the weights in the original estimator by their mean over a distribution of the potential treatment assignment. In our simulation study, the smoothed IPW estimator achieves a substantial variance reduction over its original version with only a small increased bias, for example two‐to‐sevenfold variance reduction for the three IPW estimators in Lunceford and Davidian [Statistics in Medicine, 23(19), 2937–2960]. In addition, our proposed smoothing can also be applied to the locally efficient and doubly robust estimator for added protection against model misspecification.

This solid waste, mainly constituted by orange peel waste (OPW), represents more than half of the raw material, and it could be exploited for the production of bio-based products and bio-fuels, according to the waste hierarchy. D-limonene, the main component of citrus essential oils, is a high-added value molecule, which can be applied in several fields, ranging from cosmetics to the food industry. Because of the high moisture content in OPW (about 80% w/w), anaerobic digestion (AD) can be considered a suitable technique for waste valorization. However, this process is challenging, due to the potential toxicity of D-limonene on fermentative bacteria. For this reason, it is necessary to remove this high-added value compound in advance. After the recovery of D-limonene via solvent extraction, the porous residual matrix, posterior to exposure to the atmosphere for some days at room temperature, releases the moisture content, thus making pyrolysis a valid alternative for the recovery of energy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCitrus 3aambient temperature 3aanaerobic digestion 3abacteria 3abiofuels 3acosmetics 3acrop production 3aenergy 3aessential oils 3afood industry 3alimonene 3aorange peels 3apyrolysis 3araw materials 3asolid wastes 3asolvents 3atoxicity 3awater content1 aRuggeri, Bernardo1 aFino, Debora0 tWaste and biomass valorization.g2018 Aug., v. 9, no. 8 p.1331-1337dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:6304x1877-26417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12649-017-9915-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03176naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002500166245011300191300001600304520152900320592002801849650001001877650001101887650001201898650001001910650001501920650000901935650001401944650001201958650001401970650002601984650001502010650001202025650001102037650001202048650001702060650003102077650002902108650006002137650003702197650002902234650004702263650003902310650002302349650001402372650002302386650004102409700002702450773008802477856004802565852000902613655001202622IND50067767720221116142226.0130712e201307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006776772DNAL7 a236610942pmid7 a10.1007/s10646-013-1076-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPlautz, Stephanie C.10aPlasticity in offspring contaminant tolerance traits: developmental cadmium exposure trumps parental effects  ap. 847-853.  aParental effects are non-genotypic influences on offspring phenotype that occur via parental phenotypes or environments, while developmental plasticity is phenotypic variation that arises during development in response to environmental cues. We evaluated the relative contribution of these two sources of phenotypic variation on offspring toxicant tolerance in Physa pomilia snails exposed to cadmium. We exposed adult snails to 0, 2, or 20 μg/L cadmium for 7 days, then exposed egg masses collected from these adults to 0 or 2 μg/L cadmium in a factorial design (adult cadmium exposure × egg mass cadmium exposure). Starting at 2 days old, we recorded time to death for hatchlings exposed to 150 μg/L cadmium for 72 h at 8 h intervals. Juveniles hatched from cadmium-exposed egg masses displayed higher cadmium tolerance than juveniles from unexposed egg masses. Among juveniles from egg masses not exposed to cadmium, offspring of parents exposed to 20 μg/L cadmium had higher cadmium tolerance than offspring of parents exposed to 0 or 2 μg/L cadmium. Our results show that both parental effects and developmental plasticity can impact offspring toxicant tolerance and point to the potential importance of both processes in understanding how offspring respond to chemical contaminants. When both parents and offspring are exposed to a toxicant, our results showed that the effects of parental exposure on offspring toxicant tolerance may be eclipsed by the effects of offspring exposure during development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhysa 3aadults 3acadmium 3adeath 3aegg masses 3aeggs 3ajuveniles 3aparents 3aphenotype 3aphenotypic plasticity 3apollutants 3aprogeny 3asnails 2aAnimals 2aBiodiversity 2aCadmium Chloridextoxicity 2aDrug Tolerancexgenetics 2aGene Expression Regulation, Developmentalxdrug effects 2aGenomic Imprintingxdrug effects 2aHermaphroditic Organisms 2aLife Cycle Stagesxdrug effectsxgenetics. 2aLongevityxdrug effectsxgenetics. 2aOvumxdrug effects 2aPhenotype 2aSnailsxphysiology 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxtoxicity1 aSalice, Christopher J.0 tEcotoxicology.g2013 July, v. 22, no. 5 p.847-853dSpringer-Verlagx0963-92927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10646-013-1076-7  aDNAL 7aarticle02572naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245013900164300001600303520091700319536021801236592002801454596009801482596011201580596008601692653001401778653001401792653001701806653001601823653001101839700001601850700001501866700002001881700002101901700001801922773015101940856008602091852000902177655001202186IND60676936720221118162533.0200327e20190703xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067693672DNAL7 a10.1080/01140671.2019.16165692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Lu10aEffects of pollens from the 10 selected Actinidia male genotypes on 4 commercial planting kiwifruit female cultivars in Southern China  ap. 155-169.  aThe effects of pollen from 10 selected (Actinidia spp.) males on 4 main commercial planting female cultivars (‘Hongyang’, ‘Jinguo’, ‘Jinyan’ and ‘Jinkui’) were studied. The main aim was to explore the theoretical basis on the breeding of highly efficient male pollenizers and improve quality. The results showed that different pollen sources had significant effects on fruit set, appearance and internal quality and 1000-seed weight. The effects on fruit set were related to the different ploidy combinations of male and female. Pollen from diploid males had a positive effect on diploid, tetraploid and hexaploid female cultivars. The effect of pollen from hexaploid males on diploid and tetraploid females was significantly inferior to the effect on the hexaploid female. Overall, the results provide a theoretical basis for improving fruit quality, pollination efficiency, fruit set and yield.  aThis work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant number 31760559], [grant number 31760567], the Jiangxi Provincial Department of Science & Technology [grant number 20161ACF60007].  aPublisher supplied data  a31760559cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a20161ACF60007cJiangxi Provincial Department of Science & Technologydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100010857  aJXARS-05cJiangxi Provincial Construction of Kiwifruit Industry Technology System 0aActinidia 0akiwifruit 0apollen donor 0apollination 0aploidy1 aWang, Si-Yu1 aZhong, Min1 aHuang, Chun-Hui1 aLiao, Guang-Lian1 aXu, Xiao-Biao0 tNew Zealand journal of crop and horticultural science.g2019 July 3, v. 47, no. 3 p.155-169dTaylor & FranciswJournal:J000000127x1175-87837nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01140671.2019.16165693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03001naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245012500161300001600286500001900302520163000321592002801951650001501979650002101994650002402015650000902039650001802048650001402066650002202080650002102102650002902123650001402152650003302166650001302199650001602212650000902228650000902237650002402246700001702270700001602287700001902303700001902322773013302341856004802474852000902522655001202531IND50061900920221123020600.0130320e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006190092DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-012-1061-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBai, Zhen10aAlterations of microbial populations and composition in the rhizosphere and bulk soil as affected by residual acetochlor  ap. 369-379.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAcetochlor is a widely used herbicide in maize fields; however, the ecological risk of its residue in the soil–plant system remains unknown. We investigated the dissipation dynamics of field dose acetochlor and clarified its impact on microbial biomass and community structure both in the rhizosphere and bulk soil over 1 month after its application. Soil microbial parameters such as quantities of culturable bacteria and fungi represented by colony-forming units, soil microbial biomass carbon (SMBC), and phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) were determined across different sampling times. The results showed that the dissipation half-lives of acetochlor were, respectively, 2.8 and 3.4 days in the rhizosphere and bulk soil, and 0.02–0.07 μg/g residual acetochlor could be detected in the soil 40 days after its application. Compared to the bulk soil, microbial communities in the rhizosphere soil were inclined to be affected by the application of acetochlor: SMBC content and bacterial growth were most likely to be increased; however, fungal growth was prone to be inhibited. The principal component analysis of PLFAs, as well as the comparisons of fungi/bacteria and cy17:0/C16:1ω9c ratios between different treatments over sampling time, revealed that the soil microbial community composition was significantly affected by acetochlor at its early application stage (at day 15); thereafter, the effects of acetochlor were attenuated or even could not be detected. Our results suggested that residual acetochlor did not confer a long-term impairment on viable bacterial groups in the rhizosphere and bulk soil.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetochlor 3abacterial growth 3acommunity structure 3acorn 3afungal growth 3ahalf life 3amicrobial biomass 3amicrobial carbon 3aphospholipid fatty acids 3apollution 3aprincipal component analysis 3aresearch 3arhizosphere 3arisk 3asoil 3asoil microorganisms1 aXu, Hui-Juan1 aHe, Hong-Bo1 aZheng, Li-Chen1 aZhang, Xu-Dong0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2013 Jan., v. 20, no. 1 p.369-379dSpringer-Verlagx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-012-1061-3  aDNAL 7aarticle01454naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002100145245003400166300001600200520057300216592002800789650001000817650002000827650002000847650001200867650002400879650001500903650002100918773012500939856007901064852000901143655001201152IND60300848820221117173142.0150703e20130118xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6030084882DNAL7 a10.1126/science.12337132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcEwen, Bruce S.10aHormones and the Social Brain  ap. 279-280.  aGlucocorticoids are steroid hormones that function in immune responses, metabolism, development, and a range of behaviors.

In Central Europe, group shelterwood regeneration method relying on natural regeneration is generally considered as an approach that meets the criteria of close-to-nature silviculture. We tested its effect on wood properties in contrast to the clearcutting method with subsequent artificial regeneration by planting in the case of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.). Four localities were chosen in the Czech Republic, where both regeneration methods were applied. Sample trees were felled and subsequently evaluated for the impact of the applied regeneration method on wood properties. Modulus of elasticity, bending strength and wood density were used as indicators of wood quality. The impact of the regeneration method on the examined characteristics of the wood was not statistically significant, 78 MPa (megapascal) for shelterwood and 75 MPa for clearcutting method in the case of bending strength, and they are of negligible importance in terms of influencing end-product potential. Much more significant was the impact of the applied regeneration method on the distribution of the properties along trunk radius, where the shelterwood method provides even distribution. Non-destructive methods turned out to be useful tools for elastic properties estimation of wood as the close correlation to modulus of elasticity was confirmed (r = 0.66 and r = 0.82 for shelterwood and clearcutting method, respectively).  aPublisher supplied data  aQJ1520037cNárodní Agentura pro Zemědělský Výzkum  aA03/18cInternal Grant Agency of the Faculty of Forestry and Wood Sciences 3aPinus sylvestris 3aartificial regeneration 3aclearcutting 3amodulus of elasticity 3anatural regeneration 3ashelterwood systems 3awood density 3awood quality 3aCentral European region 3aCzech Republic1 aBorůvka, Vlastimil1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2559-57121 aBílek, Lukáš1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0752-82761 aSchönfelder, Ondřej1 aVítámvás, Jan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8181-81510 tTrees.g2021 Aug., v. 35, no. 4 p.1185-1198dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl43090x0931-18907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00468-021-02107-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01315naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245008800159300002000247520029800267592002800565650002300593650002300616650000900639650002400648650001400672700001800686700002500704700001900729700002200748773013600770856007400906852000900980655001200989IND60661000020221117223549.0190827e20150721xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066100002DNAL7 a10.1039/c5cc03520a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOhta, Takehiro12aA cryo-generated ferrous–superoxo porphyrin: EPR, resonance Raman and DFT studies  ap. 12407-12410.  aThe resonance Raman analysis of cryo-generated ferrous–superoxy heme has been performed for the first time, and its structure and the reaction mechanism are rationalized by DFT calculations.

This study is part of a series, where different sampler types are used to collect airborne lead in different environments for presentation to a portable XRF analyzer. In this case personal samples were taken at a bronze foundry where lead is added to an alloy of copper, zinc and iron to improve casting, using the closed-face 37 mm cassette, the 37 mm GSP or “cone” sampler, the 25 mm Institute of Occupational Medicine (IOM) inhalable sampler, the 25 mm Button sampler, and the open-face 25 mm cassette. Mixed cellulose-ester filters were used in all samplers. Following XRF analysis the samples were extracted with acid and analyzed by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP). For lead, all five samplers gave correlations (r²) greater than 0.9 between the two analytical methods over the entire range of found lead mass, which encompassed both the action level and the permissible exposure limit enforced in the USA by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). However, a correction was required to adjust linear regression trendlines to give a 1 ∶ 1 correlation for the average of three readings across the GSP sampler, and a similar correction was required for the single readings from the IOM sampler and the 25 mm filter cassette. The bias possibly is due to interference from other metals, possibly copper which can absorb the fluorescent radiation of lead. In the case of the Button sampler, the bias is larger, indicating a further source of error, perhaps due to the thickness of the deposit. However, in all cases, correction of the lead results did not greatly affect the overall percentage of samples where the XRF result was within 25% of the ICP result, although it did improve the overall accuracy of the results. The GSP, IOM and Button samplers are suitable candidates for further evaluation as compatible with on-site XRF analysis for lead and other metals. It is important to check carefully factory pre-set instrument calibrations, as a bias in the calibration for copper was observed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aX-ray fluorescence spectroscopy 3aair filters 3aalloys 3achemical analysis 3acopper 3afluorescence 3airon 3alead 3aoccupational health and safety 3apermissible exposure limit 3aregression analysis 3asamplers 3azinc 3aUnited States1 aPacolay, Bruce1 aAndrew, Michael E.0 tJournal of environmental monitoring.g2005 June 2, v. 7, no. 6 p.592-597dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:27191x1464-03337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b502170g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03349naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245017300169300001800342520168400360592002802044650002102072650002202093650002102115650001602136650001402152650001302166650002502179650001002204650002202214650001002236650001602246650002002262650002202282650001002304650002102314650002402335650002702359650004302386650002202429650002902451700002002480700001802500700001702518700001702535700001602552700001902568700001602587773011402603856008102717852000902798655001202807IND60439584620221119224717.0151024e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043958462DNAL7 a10.1007/s10695-015-0068-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheng, Chang-Hong10aIdentification, characterization and functional analysis of anti-apoptotic protein BCL-2-like gene from pufferfish, Takifugu obscurus, responding to bacterial challenge  ap. 1053-1064.  aApoptosis plays a crucial role in many biological processes, including development, cellular homeostasis and immune responses. The BCL-2 family is a key regulator of the mitochondrial response to apoptotic signals in the intrinsic pathway. In this study, we identified and characterized the cDNA and expression pattern of pufferfish BCL-2 (PfBCL-2). The full-length cDNA of PfBCL-2 was 1412 bp with an open reading frame of 657 bp encoding a putative protein of 219 amino acids (Accession no: KP898414). The calculated molecular mass of the PfBCL-2 was 24.2 kDa with a predicted isoelectric point of 5.27. The deduced PfBCL-2 protein exhibited four highly conserved BCL-2 homology domains, suggesting that PfBCL-2 may play a similar role in the apoptotic-signaling pathway as in other species. Real-time PCR results showed that PfBCL-2 transcript was expressed in a wide range of tissues but exhibited the greatest level of expression in blood. Transcriptional responses of PfBCL-2 exhibited different spatial and temporal expression profiles in liver and blood after bacterial infection. PfBcl-2 transcript was significantly up-regulated in liver at 6, 12, 24 and 48 h (with maximum induction at 48 h) and was up-regulated in blood at 3, 6, 12 and 24 h (with maximum induction at 12 h). Meanwhile, recombinant PfBCL-2 fused with His₆ tag was efficiently expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) and purified using Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid resin. Western blot analysis indicated that its protein level appeared to be elevated during the initial bacterial infection. These results suggest that PfBCL-2 plays important roles in immune responses against bacteria challenge.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aTakifugu obscurus 3aWestern blotting 3aamino acids 3aapoptosis 3abacteria 3abacterial infections 3ablood 3acomplementary DNA 3agenes 3ahomeostasis 3aimmune response 3aisoelectric point 3aliver 3amolecular weight 3aopen reading frames 3apro-apoptotic proteins 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asequence homology 3atranscription (genetics)1 aYang, Fang-Fang1 aLiao, Shao-An1 aMiao, Yu-Tao1 aYe, Chao-Xia1 aWang, An-Li1 aLiu, Jin-Chang1 aLiu, Li-Wei0 tFish physiology and biochemistry.g2015 Aug., v. 41, no. 4 p.1053-1064dSpringer Netherlandsx0920-17427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10695-015-0068-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02852naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002600155245010300181300001600284520123700300592002801537650002601565650002101591650002501612650002101637650002201658650002401680650002001704650002401724650001401748650001901762650001401781650001101795650001901806650001701825650001201842651001301854653002801867653001101895653003201906653001901938653001401957700002601971700002401997700002402021700001802045700002102063700002802084773009902112856009002211852000902301655001202310IND60589492920221123042037.0190318e20180203xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058949292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2017.12.0442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKanokudom, Sitthichai10aIn vitro neutralization of yellow head virus infection in shrimp using recombinant PmYRP65 protein  ap. 266-270.  aYellow head virus (YHV) is a major pathogen in the Southeast Asia shrimp aquaculture industry especially in Thailand, and YHV associated mortality results in significant economic loss. Although appropriate farm management strategies can decrease the YHV infection rate in shrimp, an epidemic of the virus remains, with no specific anti-YHV therapy. Previous reports have identified PmYRP65 as a protein that mediates YHV entry into susceptible cells, and studies using RNA interference have shown that systemic administration of double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) directed to PmYRP65 are able to provide protection against infection. This study sought to determine whether recombinant PmYRP65 protein (rPmYRP65) would be able to act as a competitive binding protein to neutralize YHV infection. To undertake this a cDNA encoding PmYRP65 was cloned, and rPmYRP65 was expressed, purified and characterized for its ability to neutralize YHV infection before injection into shrimp. The results showed that rPmYRP65 protein could significantly inhibit YHV infection by its receptor characteristic, through acting as a competitor to bind YHV. This study showed that rPmYRP65 has potential applications for neutralizing YHV infection of shrimp.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGill-associated virus 3aRNA interference 3aaquaculture industry 3abinding proteins 3acomplementary DNA 3adouble-stranded RNA 3afarm management 3afinancial economics 3amortality 3aneutralization 3apathogens 3ashrimp 3ashrimp culture 3atherapeutics 3aviruses 3aThailand 0aYellow head virus (YHV) 0aShrimp 0aRecombinant PmYRP65 protein 0aNeutralization 0aInfection1 aPrateeprat, Tantikhon1 aAttasart, Pongsopee1 aRoytrakul, Sittiruk1 aPanyim, Sakol1 aSmith, Duncan R.1 aAssavalapsakul, Wanchai0 tAquaculture.g2018 Feb. 03, v. 486 p.266-270dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2017.12.0443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03027naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100003700152245014100189300001800330520156700348592002801915650002701943650004401970650002002014650002702034650001902061650002202080650002202102650001202124650001802136650004302154650001102197650003902208650001502247700003202262700002202294700001802316700002602334700002102360700001902381773011702400856005502517852000902572655001202581IND4510595220221121102827.0150730e200210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND451059522DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1432-1033.2002.03203.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPereiraâMouriÃ¨s, Lucilia10aSoluble silkâlike organic matrix in the nacreous layer of the bivalve Pinctada maxima: A new insight in the biomineralization field  ap. 4994-5003.  aNacre organic matrix has been conventionally classified as both âwaterâsolubleâ and âwaterâinsolubleâ, based on its solubility in aqueous solutions after decalcification with acid or EDTA. Some characteristics (aspartic acidârich, silkâfibroinâlike content) were specifically attributed to either one or the other. The comparative study on the technique of extraction (extraction with water alone vs. demineralization with EDTA) presented here, seems to reveal that this generally accepted classification may need to be reconsidered. Actually, the nondecalcified soluble organic matrix, extracted in ultraâpure water, displays many of the characteristics of what until now has been called âinsoluble matrixâ. We present the results obtained on this extract and on a conventional EDTAâsoluble matrix, with various characterization methods: fractionation by sizeâexclusion and anionâexchange HPLC, amino acid analysis, glycosaminoglycan and calcium quantification, SDS/PAGE and FTIR spectroscopy. We propose that the model for the interlamellar matrix sheets of nacre given by Nakahara [In: Biomineralization and Biological Metal Accumulation, Westbroek, P. & deJong, E.W., eds, (1983) pp. 225â230. Reidel, Dordrecht, Holland] and Weiner and Traub [Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B (1984) 304, 425â434] may no longer be valid. The most recent model, proposed by LeviâKalisman etÂ al. [J. Struct. Biol. (2001) 135, 8â17], seemed to be more in accordance with our findings.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEDTA (chelating agent) 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aPinctada maxima 3aamino acid composition 3aanion exchange 3aaqueous solutions 3abiomineralization 3acalcium 3afractionation 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3amodels 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3asolubility1 aAlmeida, MariaâJosÃ©1 aRibeiro, Cristina1 aPeduzzi, Jean1 aBarthÃ©lemy, Michel1 aMilet, Christian1 aLopez, Evelyne0 tEuropean journal of biochemistry.g2002 Oct., v. 269, no. 20 p.4994-5003dBlackwell Science Ltdx0014-29567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1432-1033.2002.03203.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02717naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002000143245012700163520129200290592002801582650002301610650001301633650000901646650001501655650003101670650001001701650001501711650002601726650000901752650002001761650000801781650002001789650001801809650002001827650001001847650001001857700002501867700002501892700002601917700002001943700002201963700002501985700002102010773011802031856007702149852000902226655001202235IND60703751820221120082152.0200721e20200528xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070375182DNAL7 a10.3390/plants90606852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCechin, Joanei 10aTranscriptome Analysis Identifies Candidate Target Genes Involved in Glyphosate-Resistance Mechanism in Lolium multiflorum  aItalian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum; LOLMU) is one of the most troublesome weeds in temperate regions in the world. This weed species interfere with wheat, corn, rye, and oat, causing significant crop yield losses. This species has evolved glyphosate resistance, making it difficult to control. The mechanisms of glyphosate resistance are still unknown, and an understanding thereof will favor the development of new strategies of management. The present study is the first transcriptome study in LOLMU using glyphosate-resistant and -sensitive biotypes, aiming to identify and to provide a list of the candidate target genes related to glyphosate resistance mechanism. The transcriptome was assembled de novo, producing 87,433 contigs with an N50 of 740 bp and an average length of 575 bp. There were 92 and 54 up- and down-regulated genes, respectively, in the resistant biotype, while a total of 1683 were differentially expressed in the sensitive biotype in response to glyphosate treatment. We selected 14 highly induced genes and seven with repressed expression in the resistant biotype in response to glyphosate. Of these genes, a significant proportion were related to the plasma membrane, indicating that there is a barrier making it difficult for glyphosate to enter the cell.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLolium multiflorum 3abiotypes 3acorn 3acrop yield 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3aglyphosate 3aglyphosate resistance 3aoats 3aplasma membrane 3arye 3atemperate zones 3atranscriptome 3atranscriptomics 3aweeds 3awheat1 aPiasecki, Cristiano 1 aBenemann, Daiane  P.1 aKremer, Frederico  S.1 aGalli, Vanessa 1 aMaia, Luciano  C.1 aAgostinetto, Dirceu 1 aVargas, Leandro 0 tPlants.g2020 May 28, v. 9, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21620x2223-77477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants90606853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03158naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100002200156245006800178300001400246520183900260592002802099650002002127650001702147650001102164650002402175650001002199650001002209650001202219650001402231650001002245650001202255650001402267650001302281650002202294650001002316651001402326653000902340653001802349653001402367653002002381653001602401700001902417700002002436700001502456773009402471856009002565852000902655655001202664IND50065216520221120110626.0150427e200605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006521652DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1654-109X.2006.tb00654.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPlatt, William J.10aPine savanna overstorey influences on ground-cover biodiversity  ap. 37-50.  aQuestion: Does the overstorey of pine savannas influence plant species biodiversity in the ground cover?Location: Camp Whispering Pines (30°°41′′ N; 90°°29′′ W), eastern Louisiana (USA).Methods: We used ecologically sensitive restoration logging to remove patches of Pinus palustris (longleaf pine) in a second-growth loess plain Pinus palustris savanna managed using frequent lightning season fires. Five years later, we measured numbers of vascular plant species and transmitted light in replicated 100-m² plots. Treatments involved three different overstorey conditions: no overstorey for 5 years, no overstorey for several decades, and overstorey pines present for decades.Results: Both recent and long-term openings contained, on average, about 100 vascular plant species per 100 m², 20%% more than in similar-sized areas beneath overstorey trees. Responses varied with life form; more herbaceous species occurred in recent and older overstorey openings than beneath overstorey trees. Total numbers of all species and of less abundant forb species were positively and linearly related to light transmitted to ground level. Those species responding to openings in the overstorey and positively associated with increased transmitted light levels were monocarpic and short-lived perennial forb and grass species with a seed bank in the soil. In addition, community structure, as reflected in species composition and abundances, appeared to vary with canopy condition.Conclusions: Restoration involving ecologically sensitive removal of patches of overstorey pines in frequently burned pine savannas should benefit the ground cover and increase plant species biodiversity as a result of increased abundance of seed bank species.Abbreviations: CWP == Camp Whispering Pines; MRPP == Multi-response permutation procedures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus palustris 3aburied seeds 3acanopy 3acommunity structure 3afires 3aforbs 3agrasses 3alightning 3aloess 3alogging 3aoverstory 3asavannas 3aspecies diversity 3atrees 3aLouisiana 0aFire 0aLongleaf pine 0aLouisiana 0aPinus palustris 0aRestoration1 aCarr, Susan M.1 aReilly, Matthew1 aFahr, Jean0 tApplied vegetation science.g2006 May, v. 9, no. 1 p.37-50dOpulus Pressx1402-20017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1654-109X.2006.tb00654.x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03078naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245007300172500001900245520151000264592002801774650001301802650001801815650001301833650002001846650002101866653000801887653001001895653001301905653000801918653000801926653001301934653001501947653000801962653001101970653002201981653001702003653002702020653002202047653003902069653002302108653002102131700001702152700001802169700001702187700001602204700001602220700001902236700001702255700001502272700001402287773010302301856008702404852000902491655001202500IND60735748120221119062922.0210624e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073574812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfb.2021.1117872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPasquardini, L.10aFunctionalization of TiO2 sol-gel derived films for cell confinement  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe neuroscience field has increased enormously over the last decades, achieving the possible real application of neuronal cultures not only for reproducing neural architectures resembling in vivo tissues, but also for the development of functional devices. In this context, surface patterning for cell confinement is crucial, and new active materials together with new protocols for preparing substrates suitable for confining cells, guiding their processes in the desired configuration are extremely appreciated. Here, TiO₂ sol-gel derived films were selected as proof-of-concept materials to grow neurons in suitable confined configurations, taking advantage of the biocompatible properties of modified TiO₂ substrates. TiO₂ sol-gel derived films were made compatible with the growth of neurons thanks to a stable and controlled poly-lysine coating, obtained by silanization chemistry and streptavidin-biotin interactions. Moreover, a spotting protocol, here described and optimized, allowed the simple preparation of arrays of neurons, where cell adhesion was guided in specific areas and the neurites development driven in the desired arrangement. The resulting arrays were successfully tested for the growth and differentiation of neurons, demonstrating the possible adhesion of cells in specific areas of the film, therefore paving the way to applications such as the direct growth of excitable cells nearby electrodes of devices, with an evident enhancement of cell-electrodes communication.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3acell adhesion 3aneurites 3aneurophysiology 3atitanium dioxide 0aDIV 0aGPTMS 0aHSA-FITC 0aPBS 0aPDL 0aPLL-FITC 0aPLL-biotin 0aXPS 0aTX-100 0aTiO2 sol-gel film 0aSilanization 0aNeuronal culture array 0aMolecule spotting 0aStreptavidin-poly-lysine chemistry 0aSurface patterning 0aCell confinement1 aRoncador, A.1 aPrusakova, V.1 aVanzetti, L.1 aPotrich, C.1 aLunelli, L.1 aPederzolli, C.1 aIannotta, S.1 aMacchi, P.1 aDirè, S.0 tColloids and surfaces.g2021 Aug., v. 204 p.111787-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11946x0927-77657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2021.1117873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02039naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002500140245019200165300001800357520067600375592002801051650000801079650002301087650001401110650001101124650002501135650001701160650003901177650002701216650002101243650001101264650001901275650001701294650001901311650004401330700002901374700002101403773012201424856007401546852000901620655001201629IND60634512020221118074125.0190323e20190318xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063451202DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ra01498e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBabu, Lavanya Thilak10aLuminescent bis(benzo[d]thiazolyl)quinoxaline: facile synthesis, nucleic acid and protein BSA interaction, live-cell imaging, biopharmaceutical research and cancer theranostic application  ap. 8748-8752.  aA series of quinoxaline-2-hydroxyphenylbenzothiazole scaffolds were synthesized and characterized using NMR, UV, fluorescence spectroscopy and LCMS.

The oribatid mite (Acari: Oribatida) fauna of nests is poorly known, both in terms of abundance and diversity. We compared the oribatid assemblages within and outside red wood ant Formica polyctena nests in a Finnish oak forest. Altogether ten mounds were investigated and comparable samples were collected from adjacent soil 4 m from each mound. A total of 10 529 specimens were recovered, 4959 of them in mounds and 5633 in soil. The specimens represented 74 species (and two higher taxa) belonging to 60 genera and 39 families. Significant differences in abundance or diversity were not observed between nests and soil habitats. For nest samples the abundance of specimens significantly correlated with diversity indicating that mounds form rich habitat patches with a diverse set of niches. Mound size had no effect on community composition. The nest and soil habitats were predominantly occupied by different species resulting in dissimilarities in community composition; 34% of the species showed a preference for nest habitat and 50% for soil habitats, whereas16% were indifferent with equal abundances in both habitats. Nonetheless, most of the species with a preference for nests are frequently found in various habitats in nature, and may be classified as facultative myrmecophiles that maintain populations also in ant nests. Ant nests host abundant and diverse oribatid assemblages, which differ from the fauna in adjacent soil, and wood ants are therefore important factors in maintaining biodiversity.  aPublisher supplied data 3asoil ecology 3aant nests 3acommunity structure 3aniches 3amites 3asoil 3aSarcoptiformes 3abiodiversity 3aFormica polyctena 3afauna 3aforests 0aOribatida1 aPenttinen, Ritva1 aSorvari, Jouni1 aStewart, Alan1 aBolger, Thomas0 tInsect conservation and diversity.g2016 May, v. 9, no. 3 p.210-223dRoyal Entomological Societyx1752-458X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/icad.121593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02520naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245015600170300001600326520088800342592002801230650002001258650000901278650002701287650001901314650001201333650001501345650001801360650002301378650002001401650000901421650001201430650001401442650002001456650002401476650001201500650001201512650001601524651001201540653003001552653001601582653001201598653003901610700002001649700001601669700001601685700001501701700001701716700001801733700001501751773009501766856008401861852000901945655001201954IND60479787720221119091126.0160123e20110301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047978772DNAL7 a10.1556/AAlim.40.2011.1.172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTrenovszki, M.

Lipid peroxidation characteristics (conjugated dienes and malondialdehyde levels) were also determined in fish muscle. Data on fatty acid composition of common carp has shown that different methods of rearing and feeding cause significant differences in the proportions of n-6 and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids of this fish species. According to present results, it seems that the feeding practice of the last month before capture has determined the fatty acid profile of fillet, therefore the technology of carp nutrition should be divided into two main periods: first a growth and weight gain period; and a second one when the nutritional quality of the fillet composition can be improved.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCyprinus carpio 3acarp 3afatty acid composition 3afillet quality 3afillets 3afish farms 3alipid content 3alipid peroxidation 3amalondialdehyde 3ameat 3amuscles 3anutrition 3anutritive value 3aomega-3 fatty acids 3arearing 3asurveys 3aweight gain 3aHungary 0apond-cultured common carp 0afat content 0afeeding 0alipid peroxidation characteristics1 aLebovics, V.

Bacterial flagellin has frequently shown interesting adjuvant and protective properties in vaccine formulations. However, native P. mirabilis flagellin has not been analyzed so far. Native P. mirabilis flagellin was evaluated as a protective antigen and as an adjuvant in co-immunizations with MrpA (structural subunit of MR/P fimbriae) using an ascending UTI model in the mouse. Four groups of mice were intranasally treated with either MrpA, native flagellin, both proteins and PBS. Urine and blood samples were collected before and after immunization for specific antibodies determination. Cytokine production was assessed in immunized mice splenocytes cultures. Mice were challenged with P. mirabilis, and bacteria quantified in kidneys and bladders. MrpA immunization induced serum and urine specific anti-MrpA antibodies while MrpA coadministered with native flagellin did not. None of the animals developed significant anti-flagellin antibodies. Only MrpA-immunized mice showed a significant decrease of P. mirabilis in bladders and kidneys. Instead, infection levels in MrpA-flagellin or flagellin-treated mice showed no significant differences with the control group. IL-10 was significantly induced in splenocytes of mice that received native flagellin or MrpA-flagellin. Native P. mirabilis flagellin did not protect mice against an ascending UTI. Moreover, it showed an immunomodulatory effect, neutralizing the protective role of MrpA. P. mirabilis flagellin exhibits particular immunological properties compared to other bacterial flagellins.  aPublisher supplied data 3aProteus mirabilis 3aantibodies 3aantigens 3abacteria 3ablood 3afimbriae 3aflagellin 3aflagellum 3aimmunization 3ainterleukin-10 3akidneys 3amice 3aneutralization 3aprotective effect 3asplenocytes 3aurinary tract diseases 3aurine 3avirulence 2aAdjuvants, Immunologicxadministration & dosage 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Bacterialxbloodxurine. 2aAntigens, Bacterialxadministration & dosageximmunology. 2aBacterial Proteinsxadministration & dosageximmunology. 2aBacterial Vaccinesxadministration & dosageximmunology. 2aDisease Models, Animal 2aDrug Antagonism 2aFlagellinxadministration & dosageximmunology. 2aInterleukin-10xbiosynthesis 2aKidneyxmicrobiology 2aLeukocytes, Mononuclearximmunology 2aMice 2aProteus Infectionsximmunologyxprevention & control. 2aProteus mirabilisxgrowth & developmentximmunology. 2aUrinary Bladderxmicrobiology 2aUrinary Tract Infectionsximmunologyxprevention & control.1 aUmpiérrez, Ana1 aRial, Analía1 aChabalgoity, José A.1 aZunino, Pablo0 tAntonie van Leeuwenhoek.g2014 June, v. 105, no. 6 p.1139-1148dSpringer-Verlagx0003-60727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10482-014-0175-7  aDNAL 7aarticle03022naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245006700164300001600231520169000247592002801937650001901965650002101984650001102005650001802016650002902034650002102063650001602084650002202100650002102122650002802143650002002171650002502191650002202216651001002238700001502248700001302263700002002276700001702296700001602313700001602329773012902345856008102474852000902555655001202564IND60120017620221123043645.0150119e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012001762DNAL7 a10.1007/s11027-013-9492-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZou, Xiaoxia10aGreenhouse gas emissions from agricultural irrigation in China  ap. 295-315.  aGlobal change caused by increasing greenhouse gas (GHG) emission has become a common concern of the international community. As the largest emitter of GHGs and the second largest irrigator in the world, a clear understanding of how much GHG is emitted from irrigation in China is of great importance. But no previous studies address this question. So based on Chinese official statistical data, this study estimates GHG emissions from agricultural irrigation in order to inform strategies for reasonable use of water resources and emission reduction. The study finds that in 2010 the total carbon dioxide (CO₂) equivalent (CO₂-e) emission from agricultural irrigation is 36.72~54.16 Mt. Emissions from energy activities in irrigation (including water pumping and conveyance) account for 50 % ~ 70 % of total emissions from energy activities in the agriculture sector. Ground water pumping is the biggest emission source, accounting for 60.97 % of total irrigation emissions. Given the extent of global ground water over exploitation, balancing conservation and exploitation of ground water resources is very important to both emission reduction and sustainable development. The GHG emission intensity of irrigation depends largely on water use efficiency, so improvement of water use efficiency (both technical and managerial) can be an effective way to reduce emissions. Enhanced overall management of water utilization, balanced exploitation of water resources to avoid excessive ground water consumption, and active promotion of water use efficiency can contribute to reducing GHG emissions and pressure on water resources and advance sustainable agricultural production.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3aemissions factor 3aenergy 3aglobal change 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agreenhouse gases 3agroundwater 3airrigated farming 3airrigation rates 3asustainable agriculture 3awater resources 3awater use efficiency 3awater utilization 3aChina1 aLi, Yu’e1 aLi, Guo,1 aCremades, Roger1 aGao, Qingzhu1 aWan, Yunfan1 aQin, Xiaobo0 tMitigation and adaptation strategies for global change.g2015 Feb., v. 20, no. 2 p.295-315dSpringer-Verlagx1381-23867nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11027-013-9492-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02327naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001800143245017200161520116400333592002801497650002001525650001601545650001701561650001501578650002101593650003201614650001401646650002201660650001501682650003001697650002001727700002601747773011801773856007701891852000901968655001201977IND60703752120221122162716.0200721e20200526xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070375212DNAL7 a10.3390/plants90606712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMathew, Reny 10aCurrent Insights into Migratory Endoparasitism: Deciphering the Biology, Parasitism Mechanisms, and Management Strategies of Key Migratory Endoparasitic Phytonematodes  aDespite their physiological differences, sedentary and migratory plant-parasitic nematodes (PPNs) share several commonalities. Functional characterization studies of key effectors and their targets identified in sedentary phytonematodes are broadly applied to migratory PPNs, generalizing parasitism mechanisms existing in distinct lifestyles. Despite their economic significance, host–pathogen interaction studies of migratory endoparasitic nematodes are limited; they have received little attention when compared to their sedentary counterparts. Because several migratory PPNs form disease complexes with other plant-pathogens, it is important to understand multiple factors regulating their feeding behavior and lifecycle. Here, we provide current insights into the biology, parasitism mechanism, and management strategies of the four-key migratory endoparasitic PPN genera, namely Pratylenchus, Radopholus, Ditylenchus, and Bursaphelenchus. Although this review focuses on these four genera, many facets of feeding mechanisms and management are common across all migratory PPNs and hence can be applied across a broad genera of migratory phytonematodes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBursaphelenchus 3aDitylenchus 3aPratylenchus 3aRadopholus 3afeeding behavior 3ahost-pathogen relationships 3alifestyle 3amigratory species 3aparasitism 3aplant parasitic nematodes 3aplant pathogens1 aOpperman, Charles  H.0 tPlants.g2020 May 26, v. 9, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21620x2223-77477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants90606713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03452naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002100137245009100158300001800249520240400267592002802671650002002699650002502719650001902744650001802763650001502781650001202796650001502808650001102823650001502834650002902849650001202878700002202890773009802912856007103010852000903081655001203090IND60518978820221120073401.0160419e199612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051897882DNAL7 a10.2307/22657512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLink, William A.10aEmpirical Bayes Estimation of Proportions with Application to Cowbird Parasitism Rates  ap. 2528-2537.  aBayesian models provide a structure for studying collections of parameters such are considered in the investigation of communities, ecosystems, and landscapes. This structure allows for improved estimation of individual parameters by considering them in the context of a group of related parameters. Individual estimates are differntially adjusted toward in overall mean, with the magnitude of their adjustment based on their precision. Consequently, Bayesian estimation allows for a more reliable ranking of parameters and, in particular, a more credible identification of extreme values from a collection of estimates. In Bayesian models, individual parameters are regarded as values sampled from a specified probability distribution, called a prior. The requirements that the prior be known is often regarded as an unattractive feature of Bayesian analysis and may be the reason Bayesian analyses are not frequently applied in ecological studies. Empirical Bayes methods provide an alternative approach that incorporates the structural advantages of Bayesian models while requirng a less stringent specification of prior knowledge. Empirical Bayes methods require only that the prior be in a certain family of distributions, indexed by hyperparameters that can be estimated from the available data. This structur is of interest per se, in addition to its value in allowing for improved estimation of individual parameters; for example, hypothese regarding the existence of distinct subgroups in a collection of paramet ers can be considered under the empirical Bayes framework by allowing the hyperparameters to vary among subgroups. We describe the empirical Bayes approach in application to estimation of proportions, using data obtained in a community—wide study Brown—headed Cowbird paratism rates for illustration. Empirical Bayes estimates identify those species for which there is the greatest evidence of extreme parasitism rates. Subgroup analysis of our data on cowbird parasitism rates indicates that parasitisms rates for neotropical migrants as a group are no greater than those of resident/short—distance migrant in this forest community. Our data and analyses demonstrate that the parasitism rates for certain neotropical migrant species (Wood Thrush and Rose—breasted Grosbeak) are remarkably low while those for others (Ovenbird and Red—eyed Vireo) are remarkably high.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aHylocichla mustelina 3aMolothrus ater 3adata analysis 3aecosystems 3aforests 3alandscapes 3amodels 3aparasitism 3aprobability distribution 3atropics1 aHahn, D.

To develop conservation strategies for these species, we analyzed 242 samples using nine microsatellite markers to determine the genetic variability within and among five populations of D. alatus and three of D. costatus, representing the natural range of dipterocarps in Southeast Vietnam. Results indicated low levels of genetic variability within populations with an average gene diversity of 0.223 for D. alatus and 0.152 for D. costatus. Results of bottleneck tests indicated a reduction in population size of both species (P > 0.05). Genetic differentiation among populations was high (FST = 0.347 for D. costatus and 0.274 for D. alatus), indicating limited gene flow (Nₘ = 0.662 for D. costatus and 0.47 for D. alatus) and isolated populations related to geographical distances. Analysis of molecular variance showed high genetic variation within populations (72.92% for D. alatus and 60.81% for D. costatus) compared to among populations. Bayesian analysis and UPGMA tree also indicated the two optimal genetic clusters related to geographical distances. These results will provide a platform for the conservation, management and restoration of these species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aDipterocarpus alatus 3aendangered species 3agene flow 3agenetic markers 3agenetic variation 3ahabitat destruction 3alowland forests 3apopulation size 3avariance 3awood 3aVietnam1 aBui, Thi Tuyet-Xuan1 aNguyễn, Minh Đức,1 aShah, Syed Noor Muhammad1 aVu, Dinh-Giap1 aZhang, Yi1 aNguyễn, Minh Tâm,1 aHuang, Xiao-Hua0 tJournal of forestry research.g2019 Oct., v. 30, no. 5 p.1823-1831dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000000106x1007-662X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11676-018-0735-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02732naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001400144245013100158300002000289520116200309592002801471650000801499650001501507650001001522650001501532650002501547650002001572650001301592650001501605650001301620650001401633650001401647650002301661650002201684650003001706650001201736650001001748653001801758653001201776653000901788653002201797653000801819653003301827700001901860700001901879700001801898700005801916773014101974856007802115852000902193655001202202IND60645702520221119112002.0190529e20190508xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064570252DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.9b030052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKi, Jisun10aSensitive Plasmonic Detection of miR-10b in Biological Samples Using Enzyme-Assisted Target Recycling and Developed LSPR Probe  ap. 18923-18929.  aA portable and nonlabeled plasmonic biosensor was advanced to enable the sensitive and selective detection of microRNA (miRNA) in a biological sample. miRNAs can act on several key cellular processes, including cell differentiation, cell cycle progression, and function as oncogenes. Detection of circulating miRNAs, especially in blood or urine samples, allows noninvasive and simple diagnosis of diseases. Herein, we report a localized surface plasmon resonance sensor (LSPR) based on an enzyme-assisted target recycling system and a developed LSPR probe for the detection of gastric cancer relevant miRNAs, miR-10b. The sensitivity of the sensor was improved by increasing the concentration of the signal-amplifying agent using the duplex-specific nuclease and by strongly binding the developed LSPR probe, tannic acid capping gold nanoparticles, to the DNA. Under optimal conditions, miR-10b detection could be realized in the range of 5 pM–10 nM with a detection limit of 2.45 pM. This integrated detection system represents an approach to sensitive detection of miRNAs and offers great applications in personalized medicine and monitoring of cancer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3abiosensors 3ablood 3acell cycle 3acell differentiation 3adetection limit 3amicroRNA 3amonitoring 3ananogold 3anucleases 3aoncogenes 3aprecision medicine 3astomach neoplasms 3asurface plasmon resonance 3atannins 3aurine 0amiRNA sensing 0amiR-10b 0aLSPR 0agold nanoparticle 0aDSN 0ahybridization chain reaction1 aLee, Hyo young1 aSon, Hye Young1 aHuh, Yong-Min1 aHaam, Seungjoo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1533-83570 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2019 May 08, v. 11, no. 21 p.18923-18929dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b030053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02115naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245013300166300001600299520086100315592002801176650001301204650001101217650002001228650002101248650001501269650001901284650001901303650001801322650002001340650001401360653001901374653002101393653001301414653002401427700001301451700001601464700001401480700001601494773007701510856008501587852000901672655001201681IND60561754120221122032325.0170713e20170301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056175412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2016.11.0502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSheng, Kai10aGreen synthesized Co nanoparticles doped amino-graphene modified electrode and its application towards determination of baicalin  ap. 249-256.  aThe present paper reported an one-pot synthesis of Co nanoparticles doped amino-graphene nanocomposites (Co-amino-Gr), involving in situ generation of Co nanoparticles (NPs). The simultaneous reduction of graphene oxide (GO) and Co2+ to produce Co-amino-Gr had been achieved under mild reaction conditions using an environmentally benign reducing agent, glycine. By combining the merits of amino-Gr and the Co NPs, a highly sensitive electrochemical sensor was erected to detect baicalin based on the Co-amino-Gr nanocomposites. Under optimum conditions, the response peak currents were linear related with baicalin concentrations in the range of 1.0×10−8–8.0×10−7molL−1 with a lower detection limit of 5.0×10−9molL−1 (S/N=3).

The mineralization pattern was outlined by Alizarin red S and soft structures by Alcian blue. The temporal and spatial distribution patterns of different types of GAGs: chondroitin-4-sulphate/dermatan sulphate, chondroitin-6-sulphate, chondroitin-0-sulphate and keratan sulphate were addressed by immunohistochemistry using monoclonal antibodies against the different GAGs. The specific pattern obtained with the different antibodies suggests a unique role of the different GAG types in pattern formation and mineralization. In addition, the distribution of the different GAG types in normal and malformed vertebral columns from 15 g salmon was compared. A changed expression pattern of GAGs was found in the malformed vertebrae, indicating the involvement of these molecules during the pathogenesis. The molecular size of proteoglycans (PGs) in the vertebrae carrying GAGs was analysed with western blotting, and mRNA transcription of the PGs aggrecan, decorin, biglycan, fibromodulin and lumican by real-time qPCR. Our study reveals the importance of GAGs in development of vertebral column also in Atlantic salmon and indicates that a more comprehensive approach is necessary to completely understand the processes involved.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSalmo salar 3aWestern blotting 3aalizarin 3aglycosaminoglycans 3aimmunohistochemistry 3ajuveniles 3alight microscopy 3amessenger RNA 3amineralization 3amolecular weight 3amonoclonal antibodies 3apathogenesis 3aproteoglycans 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asalmon 3asulfates 3avertebrae1 aYtteborg, Elisabeth1 aTakle, Harald1 aEnersen, Grethe1 aBæverfjord, Grete1 aPedersen, Mona E.0 tFish physiology and biochemistry.g2015 Aug., v. 41, no. 4 p.1029-1051dSpringer Netherlandsx0920-17427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10695-015-0067-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03337naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245012000175300001400295520172900309592002802038650001702066650000902083650002302092650002502115650001302140650001102153650001002164650002002174650001302194650001502207650000902222650001202231650001102243650001902254650003002273650002802303650001402331650003502345653001702380653000802397653001602405653001602421653001702437653001002454700001302464700001402477700001702491700001902508700001402527700001702541773010702558856008502665852000902750655001202759IND60635515620221117005314.0190401e20180616xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063551562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2018.02.0412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmanullah, Sikandar10aQTL mapping for melon (Cucumis melo L.) fruit traits by assembling and utilization of novel SNPs based CAPS markers  ap. 18-29.  aFruit traits influence consumer’s choice and the market worth of melons. Multiple genes controlled the majority of fruit quality traits and these genes are influenced via differential factors. Cleaved amplified polymorphism sequence (CAPS) molecular markers have been validated as efficient tool for detection of numerous SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms). In the current study, genetic linkage map was assembled and QTL discovery was conducted for melon quality traits in F2:3 population, generated from crossing of MR-1 and M4-7. SNPs were detected and converted into CAPS markers from retrieved data of high-throughput resequencing. Two parental lines (MR-1 and M4-7) of melon were analyzed and resequenced for assembling the novel CAPS markers. Totally, 91.54% and 90.00% of assembled sequences covered the reference genome of these two distinct parental lines, respectively. Analysis of assembled genomic data revealed total 2,761,801 SNPs and 7741 CAPS locus. Overall, 410 novels CAPS molecular markers were assembled along with 4-restriction endonuclease and 160 CAPS pairs displayed polymorphic bands of predictable length after screening by the use of PCR and process of enzyme digestion, with 39% rate of polymorphism. Genetic linkage map construction was done by genotyping of these novel CAPS markers within F2:3 population and this map totally spanned 2848.68 cM length with 12 chromosomes and 160 CAPS markers. Total 24 minor QTLs were discovered for fruit weight, firmness, flesh firmness, Brix, fruit length, width and shape with different genetic loci on various chromosomal locations. These newly assembled CAPS markers will be valuable and potent for future breeding and genetic schemes in melon.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCucumis melo 3abrix 3achromosome mapping 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3afirmness 3afruits 3agenes 3agenetic markers 3agenomics 3agenotyping 3aloci 3amarkets 3amelons 3aplant breeding 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aquantitative trait loci 3ascreening 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 0aCAPS markers 0aSNP 0aQTL mapping 0aLinkage map 0aFruit traits 0aMelon1 aLiu, Shi1 aGao, Peng1 aZhu, Zicheng1 aZhu, Qianglong1 aFan, Chao1 aLuan, Feishi0 tScientia horticulturae.g2018 June 16, v. 236 p.18-29dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4108x0304-42387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2018.02.0413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03651naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100006500145245008200210300001800292500002000310520233100330592002802661596001002689596002802699650001102727650001202738650002602750650001402776650001602790650001102806650001802817650001302835650001402848650002602862650002402888650002502912650001602937700002402953700002402977773012803001856007903129852000903208655001203217IND60675353720221116141228.0191106e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067535372DNAL7 a10.1111/1365-2656.129992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorrongiello, John R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9608-415110aFishing constrains phenotypic responses of marine fish to climate variability  ap. 1645-1656.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aFishing and climate change are profoundly impacting marine biota through unnatural selection and exposure to potentially stressful environmental conditions. Their effects, however, are often considered in isolation, and then only at the population level, despite there being great potential for synergistic selection on the individual. We explored how fishing and climate variability interact to affect an important driver of fishery productivity and population dynamics: individual growth rate. We projected that average growth rate would increase as waters warm, a harvest‐induced release from density dependence would promote adult growth, and that fishing would increase the sensitivity of somatic growth to temperature. We measured growth increments from the otoliths of 400 purple wrasse (Notolabrius funicola), a site‐attached temperate marine reef fish inhabiting an ocean warming hotspot. These were used to generate nearly two decades of annually resolved growth estimates from three populations spanning a period before and after the onset of commercial fishing. We used hierarchical models to partition variation in growth within and between individuals and populations, and attribute it to intrinsic (age, individual‐specific) and extrinsic (local and regional climate, fishing) drivers. At the population scale, we detected predictable additive increases in average growth rate associated with warming and a release from density dependence. A fishing–warming synergy only became apparent at the individual scale where harvest resulted in the 50% reduction of thermal growth reaction norm diversity. This phenotypic change was primarily caused by the loss of larger individuals that showed a strong positive response to temperature change after the onset of size‐selective harvesting. We speculate that the dramatic loss of individual‐level biocomplexity is caused by either inadvertent fisheries selectivity based on behaviour, or the disruption of social hierarchies resulting from the selective harvesting of large, dominant and resource‐rich individuals. Whatever the cause, the removal of individuals that display a positive growth response to temperature could substantially reduce species’ capacity to adapt to climate change at temperatures well below those previously thought stressful.  aPublisher supplied data  cCSIRO  cUniversity of Melbourne 3aadults 3aclimate 3aenvironmental factors 3afisheries 3amarine fish 3amodels 3aocean warming 3aotoliths 3aphenotype 3aphenotypic plasticity 3apopulation dynamics 3aselective harvesting 3atemperature1 aSweetman, Philip C.1 aThresher, Ronald E.0 tjournal of animal ecology.g2019 Nov., v. 88, no. 11 p.1645-1656dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl16424x0021-87907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.129993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02973naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005200142245011400194300002000308500001900328520112800347592002801475650001901503650002301522650003001545650001301575650001801588700005501606700005501661700005701716700005501773700001701828700005501845700005201900700005901952700001702011700001302028700001402041700005102055700005602106700005302162700005402215773014902269856007602418852000902494655001202503IND60704258620221116230019.0200722e20200618xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070425862DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.0c049812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Ye1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0821-746910aEthylene Selectivity in Electrocatalytic CO₂ Reduction on Cu Nanomaterials: A Crystal Phase-Dependent Study  ap. 12760-12766.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe crystal phase of metal nanocatalysts significantly affects their catalytic performance. Cu-based nanomaterials are unique electrocatalysts for CO₂ reduction reaction (CO₂RR) to produce high-value hydrocarbons. However, studies to date are limited to the conventional face-centered cubic (fcc) Cu. Here, we report a crystal phase-dependent catalytic behavior of Cu, after the successful synthesis of high-purity 4H Cu and heterophase 4H/fcc Cu using the 4H and 4H/fcc Au as templates, respectively. Remarkably, the obtained unconventional crystal structures of Cu exhibit enhanced overall activity and higher ethylene (C₂H₄) selectivity in CO₂RR compared to the fcc Cu. Density functional theory calculations suggest that the 4H phase and 4H/fcc interface of Cu favor the C₂H₄ formation pathway compared to the fcc Cu, leading to the crystal phase-dependent C₂H₄ selectivity. This study demonstrates the importance of crystal phase engineering of metal nanocatalysts for electrocatalytic reactions, offering a new strategy to prepare novel catalysts with unconventional phases for various applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3acatalytic activity 3adensity functional theory 3aethylene 3ananocatalysts1 aFan, Zhanxi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3133-65031 aWang, Jiong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2691-51051 aLing, Chongyi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4126-90361 aNiu, Wenxin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0835-32951 aHuang, Zhiqi1 aLiu, Guigao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0018-12491 aChen, Bo1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6743-92511 aLai, Zhuangchai1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8743-65681 aLiu, Xiaozhi1 aLi, Bing1 aZong, Yun1 aGu, Lin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7504-031X1 aWang, Jinlan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4529-874X1 aWang, Xin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2686-466X1 aZhang, Hua1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9518-740X0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2020 June 18, v. 142, no. 29 p.12760-12766dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.0c049813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03495naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149100001600167245007200183300001400255520139400269592002801663650002101691650001801712650002201730650002401752650001901776650002401795650002301819650001901842650001101861650001701872650001001889650002701899650003001926650001701956650001001973650001201983650003301995650004902028650002202077650005602099650001102155650004902166650002902215650005302244650001702297650003002314650004902344650003702393651001002430651002502440700001502465700003202480700001702512700001802529700001602547700001602563700001902579700002002598773009802618856008402716852000902800655001202809IND4469868420221122122935.0141111e20120228xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446986842DNAL7 a218649822pmid7 a10.1016/j.vetpar.2011.08.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCassini, R.10aNew insights into the epidemiology of bovine piroplasmoses in Italy  ap. 77-82.  aFew studies have been published on bovine piroplasmoses in Italy, and therefore a clear picture of the epidemiology of these infections is difficult to obtain. Vertebrate and invertebrate hosts in Central and Northern Regions of Italy were investigated in 2005 and 2006, when microscopy, molecular tools and serological tests were applied to 468 blood samples drawn from cattle in order to evaluate the presence of these protozoa and identify possible risk factors. Ticks were also collected, identified and analyzed by molecular techniques. Microscopy identified 6.5% of the animals as positive, whereas PCR detected piroplasm DNA in 21.6%. BLAST analysis showed 67 amplicons (17.0%) referable to the Theileria sergenti/buffeli/orientalis group, 17 (4.3%) to Theileria annae, and 1 to Babesia divergens. Serology evidenced a prevalence of 45.4% for Babesia bovis, 17.4% for Babesia bigemina, and 34.9% for B. divergens. The 127 collected ticks were identified as belonging to 5 species, mostly represented by Rhipicephalus bursa, Hyalomma marginatum and Ixodes ricinus. Molecular analyses evidenced the presence of B. bovis and B. bigemina, in 3 and 5 ticks, respectively. Our findings suggest that different species of piroplasms are circulating in bovine populations in Central and Northern Italy, and provide new insights into the complex epidemiology of bovine piroplasmoses in Italy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBabesia bigemina 3aBabesia bovis 3aBabesia divergens 3aHyalomma marginatum 3aIxodes ricinus 3aRhipicephalus bursa 3aTheileria sergenti 3ablood sampling 3acattle 3aepidemiology 3ahosts 3aimmunologic techniques 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arisk factors 3aticks 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Protozoanxblood 2aArthropod Vectorsxparasitologyxphysiology. 2aBabesiaxgenetics 2aBabesiosisxepidemiologyxtransmissionxveterinary. 2aCattle 2aCattle Diseasesxepidemiologyxtransmission. 2aDNA, Protozoanxanalysis 2aDiagnostic Techniques and Proceduresxveterinary 2aRisk Factors 2aSeroepidemiologic Studies 2aTick Infestationsxepidemiologyxveterinary. 2aTicksxparasitologyxphysiology. 3aItaly 0aItalyxepidemiology.1 aMarcer, F.1 adi Regalbono, A.

Conversely, photodegradation is effective in colour reduction but has high energy requirement. A study on the synergy of a combined AD and ultra violet (UV) photodegradation treatment of distillery effluent was carried out in fluidized bed reactors to evaluate pollution reduction and energy utilization efficiencies. The combined process improved colour removal from 41% to 85% compared to that of AD employed as a stand-alone process. An overall corresponding total organic carbon (TOC) reduction of 83% was achieved. The bioenergy production by the AD step was 14.2 kJ/g total organic carbon (TOC) biodegraded while UV lamp energy consumption was 0.9 kJ/mg TOC, corresponding to up to 100% colour removal. Electrical energy per order analysis for the photodegradation process showed that the bioenergy produced was 20% of that required by the UV lamp to photodegrade 1 m ³ of undiluted pre-AD treated effluent up to 75% colour reduction. It was concluded that a combined AD-UV system for treatment of distillery effluent is effective in organic load removal and can be operated at a reduced cost.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanaerobic digestion 3abioenergy 3acarbon 3acolor 3adecolorization 3aenergy 3aenergy conservation 3aenvironmental technology 3afluidized beds 3aphotolysis 3apollution 0aAnaerobic digestion 0aphotodegradation 0adistillery effluent 0abioenergy 0aenergy analysis1 aAoyi, Ochieng0 tEnvironmental technology.g2016 Sept. 1, v. 37, no. 17 p.2243-2251dTaylor & Francisx1479-487X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09593330.2016.11463423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02891naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001800144245016800162300002000330520120900350592002801559650001401587650002101601650002301622650001701645650001701662650001001679650001301689650001801702650001901720650001301739653001501752653001701767653003601784653003301820653002801853700001401881700001201895700001801907700001501925700001401940700001101954700001301965700001301978700001901991700001602010700001702026700001402043700005202057773014102109856007802250852000902328655001202337IND60645702620221119111856.0190529e20190506xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064570262DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.9b030562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Kaiyuan10aSelf-Strengthened Oxidation-Responsive Bioactivating Prodrug Nanosystem with Sequential and Synergistically Facilitated Drug Release for Treatment of Breast Cancer  ap. 18914-18922.  aAlthough environment-sensitive prodrug-based nanoparticles (NPs) have developed rapidly, lots of prodrug NPs still show poor selectivity and efficiency of parent drug bioactivation because of tumor heterogeneity. Herein, self-strengthened bioactivating prodrug-based NPs are fabricated via co-encapsulation of oxidation-responsive thioether-linked linoleic acid-paclitaxel conjugates (PTX-S-LA) and β-lapachone (LPC) into polymeric micelles (PMs). Following cellular uptake, PMs first release LPC to significantly elevate the reactive oxidative species (ROS) level through NAD(P)H: quinone oxidoreductase-1 (NQO1) catalysis. Then, NQO1-generated ROS in combination with endogenous high ROS levels in tumor cells could synergistically facilitate PTX-S-LA to release the active cytotoxic agent PTX. Such a novel prodrug nanosystem exhibits self-strengthened prodrug bioactivation, ultraselective release, and cytotoxicity between cancer and normal cells, prolonged circulation time, and enhanced tumor accumulation, leading to high antitumor efficiency and superior biosafety. Our findings pave the new way for the rational design of oxidation-responsive prodrug NPs for high-efficacy cancer chemotherapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiosafety 3abreast neoplasms 3acatalytic activity 3acytotoxicity 3adrug therapy 3adrugs 3amicelles 3ananoparticles 3aneoplasm cells 3apolymers 0apaclitaxel 0aβ-lapachone 0aself-strengthened nanoparticles 0aoxidation-responsive prodrug 0asequential drug release1 aYang, Bin1 aYe, Hao1 aZhang, Xuanbo1 aSong, Hang1 aWang, Xia1 aLi, Na1 aWei, Lin1 aWang, Yu1 aZhang, Haotian1 aKan, Qiming1 aHe, Zhonggui1 aWang, Dun1 aSun, Jin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5470-15990 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2019 May 06, v. 11, no. 21 p.18914-18922dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b030563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03618naa a2200793 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002500111040001800136072000900154072000900163072000900172072000900181072000900190072000900199100001800208245009300226300001600319500002400335500001500359520144300374650002101817650002001838650001601858650001701874650001901891650001601910650002001926650001701946650002001963650001901983650002402002650002102026650001902047650001402066650002302080650002302103650001102126650002002137650002602157650002302183650002202206650001202228650001502240650002302255650001402278650002202292650003002314650001702344650002002361651001602381651001602397653001202413653001702425700001902442700001802461700001802479700001802497700002102515773012102536852000902657856007502666930003302741945002502774946001302799655001202812IND4439565720221121222646.0100706e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443956572DNAL7 a206952752pmid7 a10.1603/ME091112doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL821 0aX380 0aL300 0aL001 0aP010 0aH0001 aHolder, Peter12aA Biosecurity Response to Aedes albopictus (Diptera: Culicidae) in Auckland, New Zealand  ap. 600-609.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aA biosecurity response was triggered by the detection of Aedes albopictus (Skuse) (Diptera: Culicidae) at the Port of Auckland, New Zealand, Ae. albopictus does not occur in New Zealand and is the most significant mosquito threat to this country, The possibility that a founding population had established, resulted in a large-scale biosecurity surveillance and control program. The response was initiated in early March 2007 and completed by mid-May 2007. No further exotic mosquitoes were detected, The response surveillance program consisted of larval habitat surveys and high density ovi- and light trapping. It was coordinated with a habitat modification and S-methoprene treatment control program, The response policies were guided by analysis of surveillance and quality assurance data, population modeling, and trace-back activities. Mosquito habitat and activity close to port were both more abundant than expected, particularly in storm water drain sumps, Sumps are difficult to treat, and during the response some modification was required to the surveillance program and the control regime. We were assured of the absence or eradication of any Ae. albopictus population, as a result of nil detection from surveillance, backed up by four overlapping rounds of insecticide treatment of habitat. This work highlights the importance of port surveillance and may serve as a guide for responses for future urban mosquito incursions. 3aAedes albopictus 3adisease vectors 3abiosecurity 3ainsecticides 3ainsect surveys 3aurban areas 3arisk assessment 3ainsect traps 3aaquatic habitat 3ainsect control 3aecological invasion 3ainvasive species 3ainsect ecology 3adetection 3apopulation ecology 3aintroduced species 3alarvae 3apest monitoring 3ahematophagous insects 3acolonizing ability 2aAedesxphysiology 2aAnimals 2aDemography 2aDrainage, Sanitary 2aEcosystem 2aLarvaxphysiology 2aMosquito Controlxmethods 2aTime Factors 2aWater Movements 3aNew Zealand 0aNew Zealand 0aharbors 0ainsect pests1 aGeorge, Sherly1 aDisbury, Mark1 aSinge, Monica1 aKean, John M.1 aMcFadden, Andrew0 tJournal of medical entomology.g2010 July, v. 47, no. 4 p.600-609dEntomological Society of Americax0022-25857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603/ME091113Available from publisher's Web site  a20100913b20101001c00000000  aINDd4CTe2010/08/13  aOther US 7aarticle01762naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245008100162500001400243520047800257592002800735650001200763650001700775650001300792650001700805650001400822650001400836650001100850653002800861653002300889653002000912653002700932653003400959700001400993700001801007700002201025700002301047700002001070700001901090700002201109773009401131856008201225852000901307655001201316IND60720520920221117070405.0210219e20210122xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072052092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2020.1318722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUmeda, Rui10aSelective synthesis of 1-halonaphthalenes by copper-catalyzed benzannulation  aNAL-light  aThe synthesis of 1-halonaphthalenes by the Cu-catalyzed benzannulation reaction of 2-(phenylethynyl)benzaldehyde and alkynes in the presence of the halogen reagents such as NBS, NCS, and NIS, was developed.

In this short piece I link some wide-ranging suggestions for academic research by environment and development economists that is needed to further this aim, with the key idea in Acemoglu and Robinson's (2012) Why Nations Fail. Their book argues strongly that sustained, very long-term economic growth through national industrial revolutions requires ‘inclusive institutions’ that distribute political power broadly over a nation's economic, class and geographical sectors. This is because long-term growth needs technical innovations, which cause creative destruction (structural adjustment) of existing technologies, which in turn harms the interests of existing elites. If elites are too powerful, they will block new technologies, so as to keep their powers to extract rents from the rest of society, and the nation will then fail (to grow sustainably).  aPublisher supplied data 3aeconomic development 3aeconomists 3aenvironmental policy 3apolitics0 tEnvironment and development economics.g2014 June, v. 19, no. 3 p.329-332dCambridge University PresswJournal:2151x1469-43957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1355770X140003453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02863naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002000155245011900175300001600294520134100310592002801651650001601679650001801695650001701713650001001730650002101740650002901761650001601790650001001806650001601816650001101832650001301843650001601856650002301872653001601895653001601911653001201927653001401939653002101953653001701974700001701991700002002008700005902028700002202087700001902109700001902128773009902147856009002246852000902336655001202345IND60589493020221123042206.0190318e20180203xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058949302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2017.12.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSolstorm, David10aDissolved oxygen variability in a commercial sea-cage exposes farmed Atlantic salmon to growth limiting conditions  ap. 122-129.  aUnderstanding dissolved O2 flux in marine cages, and how individual fish respond to and experience such variation, is critical to optimizing growth and production performance of farmed salmon. We used a high resolution environmental monitoring system to create a 3-dimensional map of a commercial marine cage with respect to salinity, temperature and dissolved O2 through time, while also tracking the oxygen experience of 4 individually tagged Atlantic salmon. Despite all of the dissolved O2 measurements at the reference site being physiologically suitable for maximum growth, 1 in 4 of the recordings collected within the cage were below dissolved O2 levels known to reduce feed intake and growth. Recorded dissolved O2 in the cage ranged from 26 to 90% saturation with a high degree of vertical, horizontal and temporal variation. Poorest dissolved O2 conditions consistently occurred at night in the central and down-current cage positions. Dissolved O2 levels experienced by individual fish ranged from 30 to 90% saturation, with variation within 5minute intervals as large as 32 percentage points. These results expand the current body of knowledge on environmental variability in marine cages, and provide valuable insights to aid farm managers in focusing mitigation and monitoring efforts when and where they are most needed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalmo salar 3aanimal growth 3acage culture 3acages 3adissolved oxygen 3aenvironmental monitoring 3afarmed fish 3afarms 3afeed intake 3aoxygen 3asalinity 3atemperature 3atemporal variation 0aSalmo salar 0aAquaculture 0aHypoxia 0aBehaviour 0aDissolved oxygen 0aFish welfare1 aOldham, Tina1 aSolstorm, Frida1 aKlebert, Pascal1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9095-81481 aStien, Lars Helge1 aVågseth, Tone1 aOppedal, Frode0 tAquaculture.g2018 Feb. 03, v. 486 p.122-129dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2017.12.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02922naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245011600171300001600287520154500303592002801848650001701876650000901893650002001902650002001922650001201942650002001954650001201974650002601986650001502012650001902027650002202046650001302068650002402081650001102105650002202116650001302138650001602151650000902167650001302176651001102189700003202200700002602232773009202258856008102350852000902431655001202440IND60440574320221120073832.0151024e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044057432DNAL7 a10.1007/s12571-015-0483-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGoldsmith, Peter D.14aThe economics of post-harvest loss: a case study of the new large soybean - maize producers in tropical Brazil  ap. 875-888.  aReducing post-harvest loss (PHL) allows farmers to keep more of their crop and increases grain supplies, which are critical in a world where resources are scarce and rural developing economies struggle. While the policy goal is well understood, the micro-economics of loss are not. Little research focuses on the role managers play in reducing loss. Using economic theory and field research, we built and tested a conceptual model of farmers’ loss problem. We modelled a tradeoff where the opportunity costs of loss mitigation were sufficiently high to motivate managers to increase rather than reduce PHL. The setting was the fast growing tropical maize and soybean region of Mato Grosso, Brazil. Results showed that harvest losses of 6 % and short-haul losses of 2 % in soybean, as an opportunity cost, might be insufficient to cause farmers to be as aggressive in reducing loss as policy makers would expect. This is because delay in harvesting soybean may delay the planting of maize as a second crop (safrinha) on the same land, causing risk of loss of this valuable crop owing to drought and inhibition of pollination. Hastening of the harvest of soybean (and consequent loss) can be achieved by desiccation and increased harvesting speeds. The results provide insights, which may be applicable elsewhere, into the complexities of tropical grain production where high moisture environments, large spatial contexts and poor infrastructure promote tactics, such as those described, in order maximize the benefits of double cropping.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3acorn 3acrop production 3adouble cropping 3adrought 3aeconomic theory 3afarmers 3afield experimentation 3aharvesting 3ainfrastructure 3aissues and policy 3amanagers 3amathematical theory 3amodels 3aopportunity costs 3aplanting 3apollination 3arisk 3asoybeans 3aBrazil1 aMartins, Anamaria Gaudencio1 ade Moura, Altair Dias0 tFood security.g2015 Aug., v. 7, no. 4 p.875-888dSpringer Netherlandsx1876-45177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12571-015-0483-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02351naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245007600165300001600241520109400257592002801351650002201379650001001401650002201411650003101433650002401464650001201488650001101500650002301511650001201534650002701546650002001573650002601593653001001619653002201629653002301651653001901674700002401693773012101717856008201838852000901920655001201929IND60528696120221117034300.0160716e20160610xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052869612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2016.05.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArora, Amita10aSIRT2 regulates insulin sensitivity in insulin resistant neuronal cells  ap. 747-752.  aInsulin resistance in brain is well-associated with pathophysiology of deficits in whole-body energy metabolism, neurodegenerative diseases etc. Among the seven sirtuins, SIRT2 is the major deacetylase expressed in brain. Inhibition of SIRT2 confers neuroprotection in case of Parkinson’s disease (PD) and Huntington’s disease (HD). However, the role of this sirtuin in neuronal insulin resistance is not known. In this study, we report the role of SIRT2 in regulating insulin-sensitivity in neuronal cells in vitro. Using approaches like pharmacological inhibition of SIRT2, siRNA mediated SIRT2 knockdown and over-expression of wild-type and catalytically-mutated SIRT2, we observed that downregulation of SIRT2 ameliorated the reduced activity of AKT and increased insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in insulin resistant neuro-2a cells. The data was supported by over expression of catalytically-inactive SIRT2 in insulin-resistant human SH-SY5Y neuronal cells. Data highlights a crucial role of SIRT2 in regulation of neuronal insulin sensitivity under insulin resistant condition.  aPublisher supplied data 3aParkinson disease 3abrain 3aenergy metabolism 3agene expression regulation 3agene overexpression 3aglucose 3ahumans 3ainsulin resistance 3aneurons 3aneuroprotective effect 3apathophysiology 3asmall interfering RNA 0aSIRT2 0aInsulin signaling 0aInsulin resistance 0aNeuronal cells1 aDey, Chinmoy Sankar0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2016 June 10, v. 474 p.747-752dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2016.05.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01354naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245006000158300002000218520036600238592002800604650001400632650002500646650001800671650001200689650001400701650001900715700001600734700001600750700001600766700001500782773013600797856007400933852000901007655001201016IND60661000520221117223425.0190827e20150616xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066100052DNAL7 a10.1039/c5cc03543k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChang, Aiping10aEnhanced enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulose in microgels  ap. 10502-10505.  aA cellulose-based microgel, where an individual microgel contains approximately one cellulose chain on average, is synthesized via free radical polymerization of a difunctional small-molecule N,N′-methylenebisacrylamide in cellulose solution.

In addition to the more common RANS k–ε turbulence models, a Multi-scale k–ε model was tested since experimental investigations of the geometry imply large differences in behaviour between turbulent eddies of different length-scales. Empiric models for the driving hydrodynamic factors for turbulent fragmentation using the extra information given by multi-scale simulations were developed. These models are shown to give a more reasonable approximation of local fragmentation than models based on the previously used RANS k–ε models when comparing to hydrodynamic measurements in an experimental model.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical engineering 3ahydrodynamics 3amodels 3aturbulent flow1 aInnings, Fredrik1 aRevstedt, Johan1 aTrägårdh, Christian,1 aBergenståhl, Björn0 tChemical engineering science.g2012 June 18, v. 75 p.309-317dElsevier Ltdx0009-25097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ces.2012.03.0453Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03671naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006000147242012600207245007800333300001300411520244900424592002802873653002202901653001402923653001102937653001702948653001402965653001702979653001202996653002103008700001903029700001903048700002003067773013203087856008103219852000903300655001203309IND60744176020221118092208.0210709e20210208xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074417602DNAL7 a10.1093/ornithapp/duaa0692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aByerly, Paige A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0121-184910aLas características de la colonia influencian la supervivencia del nido en una población de Sterna dougallii del Caribe10aColony characteristics influence nest survival of Caribbean Roseate Terns  ap. 1-15.  aDetermining how site characteristics influence reproductive success can help guide conservation planning for declining wildlife populations. For colonially breeding seabirds, nest survival and predation risk can be influenced by both colony and nest site characteristics such as colony size, nest density, and nest location. We evaluated the reproductive success of a declining population of Roseate Terns (Sterna dougallii) in the United States and British Virgin Islands to identify primary causes of nest failure and investigate the influence of colony and nest site covariates on nest survival. In addition, we measured the influence of colony characteristics on chick provisioning to determine if resource competition in larger colonies affected foraging rates. Monitoring was conducted in 2017–2018 via motion-triggered cameras, which enable 24-hr monitoring with minimal nest disturbance. Nest survival was defined by both hatch success and early chick success, defined as a chick surviving from hatching through the fourth post-hatch day. We monitored 118 nests in 6 colonies over the 2 breeding seasons. We found that predation was the primary cause of nest failure. Both hatch and nest success increased with colony size, and neither nest survival nor predation probability was influenced by individual nest site characteristics. Provisioning rates were comparable among colony sites and did not vary with colony size. Our results suggest that directing management efforts toward enhancing colony size, rather than focusing on nest site characteristics, can be beneficial for tropical seabird conservation. LAY SUMMARY Determining how site characteristics enhance nest survival can benefit the conservation of threatened and endangered seabirds like Roseate Terns (Sterna dougallii). We used nest cameras to determine the effects of colony and nest site covariates on reproductive success, predation probability, and provisioning rates of Roseate Terns breeding in the Virgin Islands in six colonies over two years. Predation was the primary cause of nest failure. Both hatch and early chick survival increased with colony size but were not otherwise influenced by site characteristics. Chick provisioning rates were not influenced by colony size. For tropical seabirds, directing management toward increasing colony size may be an effective strategy for enhancing conservation efforts while maximizing limited management resources.  aPublisher supplied data 0acamera monitoring 0aCaribbean 0acolony 0anest success 0apredation 0aRoseate Tern 0aseabird 0aSterna dougallii1 aZaluski, Susan1 aNellis, Daniel1 aLeberg, Paul L.0 tOrnithological applications.g2021 Feb. 8, v. 123, no. 1 p.1-15dUniversity of California PresswJournal:27703x2732-46217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ornithapp/duaa0693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03126naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245016100170300001300331500001500344520129900359592002801658650001801686650001001704650001001714650001001724650001201734650000901746650001601755650001001771650002601781650001001807650001301817650001101830650001301841650001201854651001101866651001201877653001001889700001501899700001801914700001701932700001801949700001601967700001701983700002202000700001802022700001402040700001702054700001802071700001702089700002302106700001502129700001702144700001702161700001502178700001302193700002202206700001402228773008102242856008502323990002302408852000902431655001202440IND60096268120221119211604.0141104e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009626812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cretres.2012.01.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNéraudeau, D.14aThe Hauterivian–Barremian lignitic bone bed of Angeac (Charente, south-west France): stratigraphical, palaeobiological and palaeogeographical implications  ap. 1-14.  a2019-12-06  aThis paper provides the sedimentological, palaeontological and biostratigraphical characteristics of a newly discovered lignite-bearing sedimentary succession in western France. The lignitic bed, which is reminiscent of some Wealden facies in southern England, is located in Angeac in the Charentes region. The plant remains occur as three-dimensionally preserved mesofossils (cuticles, charred ferns and seeds, cones and twigs) and larger pieces of wood. The deposits contain variable amounts of such material and at one horizon in particular, an outstanding accumulation of dinosaur teeth and bones. Among the vertebrate remains are the longest sauropod femur (ca. 220cm) yet found and bones representing an ornithomimosaur herd of at least eight individuals. The palynomorph content of the clay associated with the bones and lignitic material indicates a Hauterivian–Barremian age. The abundance in the fossil assemblage of freshwater unionoid bivalves, some preserved in life position, the presence of freshwater algae, and the scarcity of brackish or marine species indicate that the depositional environment was a swamp only very occasionally connected to the sea. The forest bordering the swamp was dominated by cheirolepidiaceous trees co-occurring with a diverse assemblage of ferns.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclay fraction 3aseeds 3ateeth 3aherds 3afossils 3awood 3avertebrates 3atrees 3aferns and fern allies 3afemur 3abranches 3aswamps 3aBivalvia 3aforests 3aFrance 3aEngland 0aAlgae1 aAllain, R.1 aBallèvre, M.1 aBatten, D.J.1 aBuffetaut, E.1 aColin, J.P.1 aDabard, M.P.1 aDaviero-Gomez, V.1 aEl Albani, A.1 aGomez, B.1 aGrosheny, D.1 aLe Lœuff, J.1 aLeprince, A.1 aMartín-Closas, C.1 aMasure, E.1 aMazin, J.-M.1 aPhilippe, M.1 aPouech, J.1 aTong, H.1 aTournepiche, J.F.1 aVullo, R.0 tCretaceous research.g2012 Oct., v. 37 p.1-14dElsevier Ltdx0195-66717nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cretres.2012.01.0063Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03429naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006200140245011800202300001800320500002000338520160800358592002801966596002401994596006302018596005702081596002302138596002102161650001602182650003402198650001402232650002802246650001802274650002402292650002602316650001602342650001502358650001102373650000902384700006202393700008602455700001902541700001502560700001702575700005702592700005702649773013302706856007502839852000902914655001202923IND60788210320221123023924.0220811e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078821032DNAL7 a10.1002/jeq2.201562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTaylor, Stephen E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9019-591010aLong‐term accumulation, depth distribution, and speciation of silver nanoparticles in biosolids‐amended soils  ap. 1679-1689.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBiosolids can be a source of metals and metal nanoparticles. The objective of this study was to quantify and characterize the accumulation and transport of silver (Ag) in a natural soil that has received agronomically recommended rates of biosolids as fertilizer from 1994 to 2017. Total Ag concentrations were measured in biosolids and soil samples collected from 0 to 10 cm between 1996 and 2017. The depth distribution of Ag in soil to 60‐cm depth was measured in 2017. Electron microscopy, in combination with X‐ray spectroscopy, and X‐ray absorption spectroscopy were used to characterize the Ag. The Ag concentrations in the biosolids‐amended soil increased steadily from 1996 until 2007, after which the concentrations leveled off at about 1.25 mg Ag kg⁻¹ soil. This corresponded with a decrease of Ag concentrations in biosolids over time. The majority of the Ag (82%) was confined to the top 10 cm of the soil, small amounts (14%) were detected at 10‐to‐20‐cm depth, and trace amounts (4%) were detected at 30‐to‐40‐cm depth. The Ag in the biosolids was identified as S‐containing nanoparticles (Ag₂S) with a diameter of 10–12 nm; however, in soil, the Ag concentrations were too low to allow identification of Ag speciation. This study shows that in a real‐world field scenario, biosolids applied at agronomic rates represent a long‐term, economically viable source of crop nutrients without increasing the concentration of total Ag in soil above a maximum of 1.5 mg Ag kg⁻¹. This concentration is below estimated ecotoxicity limits for Ag₂S in soil.  aPublisher supplied data  agrid.436923.9cEMSL  aContract No.~DE‐AC02‐06CH11357cAdvanced Photon Source  cWSU‐PNNL Distinguished Graduate Student Fellowship  a1014527cUSDA/NIFA  aW4188cUSDA/NIFA 3aX-radiation 3aX-ray absorption spectroscopy 3abiosolids 3aeconomic sustainability 3aecotoxicology 3aelectron microscopy 3aenvironmental quality 3afertilizers 3ananosilver 3asilver 3asoil1 aPearce, Carolyn I.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3098-16151 aChowdhury, Indranilc(Electrical engineer)1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1412-72941 aKovarik, Libor1 aLeavy, Ian1 aBaum, Steven1 aBary, Andy I.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6240-687X1 aFlury, Markus1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3344-39620 tJournal of environmental quality.g2020 Nov., v. 49, no. 6 p.1679-1689dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl1642x0047-24257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jeq2.201563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02370naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001400142245006600156300002000222500001900242520135100261592002801612650002401640650001501664650001701679700001301696700001801709700001301727700001401740700005601754773014901810856007601959852000902035655001202044IND60704259020221116225909.0200722e20200619xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070425902DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.0c051752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Yang10aColloidal Synthesis of Nanohelices via Bilayer Lattice Misfit  ap. 12777-12783.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aHelical structures are ubiquitous in natural and synthetic materials across multiple length scales. Excellent and sometimes unusual chiral optical, mechanical, and sensing properties have been previously demonstrated in such symmetry-breaking shape, yet a general principle to realize helical structures at the sub-100 nm scale via colloidal synthesis remains underexplored. In this work, we describe the wet-chemical synthesis of monodisperse nanohelices based on gadolinium oxide (Gd₂O₃). Aberration-corrected electron microscopy revealed that individual nanohelices consist of a bilayer structure with the outer and inner layers derived from the {111} and {100} planes of bulk Gd₂O₃, respectively. Distinct from existing inorganic nanocoils with flexible bending geometries, the built-in lattice misfit between two adjacent crystal planes induces continuous helical growth yielding three-dimensional rigid nanohelices. Furthermore, the presence of water in the reaction was found to suppress the formation of nanohelices, producing nanoplates expressing predominantly {111} planes. Our study not only provides a bottom-up synthetic route and mechanistic understanding of nanohelices formation but may also open up new possibilities for creating chiral plasmonic nanostructures, luminescent biological labels, and nanoscale transducers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectron microscopy 3agadolinium 3aluminescence1 aLi, Yuda1 aJeong, Soojin1 aWang, Yi1 aChen, Jun1 aYe, Xingchen1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6851-27210 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2020 June 19, v. 142, no. 29 p.12777-12783dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.0c051753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03380naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100005900145245011100204300001800315500002000333520216300353592002802516596004502544650001202589650001702601650002402618650002602642650001402668650001802682650001102700650001402711650001402725700006302739773012802802856007902930852000903009655001203018IND60675354220221116141228.0191106e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067535422DNAL7 a10.1111/1365-2656.130722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcPeek, Mark A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7794-946610aDisentangling ecologically equivalent from neutral species: The mechanisms of population regulation matter  ap. 1755-1765.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe neutral theory of biodiversity explored the structure of a community of ecologically equivalent species. Such species are expected to display community drift dynamics analogous to neutral alleles undergoing genetic drift. While entire communities of species are not ecologically equivalent, recent field experiments have documented the existence of guilds of such neutral species embedded in real food webs. What demographic outcomes of the interactions within and between species in these guilds are expected to produce ecological drift versus coexistence remains unclear. To address this issue, and guide empirical testing, we consider models of a guild of ecologically equivalent competitors feeding on a single resource to explore when community drift should manifest. We show that community drift dynamics only emerge when the density‐dependent effects of each species on itself are identical to its density‐dependent effects on every other guild member. In contrast, if each guild member directly limits itself more than it limits the abundance of other guild members, all species in the guild are coexisting, even though they all are ecologically equivalent with respect to their interactions with species outside the guild (i.e. resources, predators, mutualists). Hence, considering only interspecific ecological differences generating density dependence, and not fully accounting for the preponderance of mechanisms causing intraspecific density dependence, will provide an incomplete picture for segregating between neutrality and coexistence. We also identify critical experiments necessary to disentangle guilds of ecologically equivalent species from those experiencing ecological drift, as well as provide an overview of ways of incorporating a mechanistic basis into studies of species coexistence and neutrality. Identifying these characteristics, and the mechanistic basis underlying community structure, is not merely an exercise in clarifying the semantics of coexistence and neutral theories, but rather reflects key differences that must exist among community members in order to determine how and why communities are structured.  aPublisher supplied data  aDEB-1748945cNational Science Foundation 3aalleles 3abiodiversity 3acommunity structure 3afield experimentation 3afood webs 3agenetic drift 3amodels 3amutualism 3apredators1 aSiepielski, Adam M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9864-743X0 tjournal of animal ecology.g2019 Nov., v. 88, no. 11 p.1755-1765dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl16424x0021-87907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.130723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02176naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245011600165500001400281520072000295592002801015650001101043650002201054650002301076650001401099650002201113650001301135650001401148650001601162650001101178653001301189653002001202653002801222653003001250653002701280700001801307700005601325700006101381700001601442700001901458700001501477700001801492773010201510856008501612852000901697655001201706IND60720521420221117070006.0210114e20210119xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072052142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2020.1527072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Ruonan10aBeckmann rearrangement of ketoximes promoted by cyanuric chloride and dimethyl sulfoxide under a mild condition  aNAL-light  aSynthesis of amides via Beckmann rearrangement of ketoximes promoted by cyanuric chloride (TCT)/DMSO under mild conditions has been reported.

The analysis indicates, inter alia, that there is a potential family of multilateral and unilateral policy reforms which can be set by pollution-intensive and pollution-moderate countries to reduce global emissions. In particular, the analysis suggests that a unilateral increase in the subsidy in the pollution-moderate country may reduce global emissions. The multilateral policy reform of the subsidy and tax in the pollution-intensive country can also reduce global emissions and increase welfare under certain conditions. The role of product differentiation in the context of policy reform is also examined.  aPublisher supplied data 3aemissions 3aissues and policy 3amodels 3aresearch and development 3asubsidies 3ataxes0 tEnvironment and development economics.g2014 Aug., v. 19, no. 4 p.440-465dCambridge University PresswJournal:2151x1469-43957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1355770X130005213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03009naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245010300169300001600272520153000288592002801818650001101846650001301857650001101870650002501881650001101906650002401917650001001941650001201951650001001963650001001973650001201983650001601995650001102011650001002022650002002032650001102052650001202063650001102075651000902086653001202095653001002107653001702117653001902134653000902153700001302162700001902175700001402194700001802208773013802226856008202364852000902446655001202455IND60555221420221119194546.0161026e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055522142DNAL7 a10.12980/APJTB.4.2014C12012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHajimohammadi, B10aRate of carcass and offal condemnation in animals slaughtered at Yazd Slaughterhouse, central Iran  ap. 736-739.  aTo determine the rate of carcass and offal condemnation in the animals slaughtered at Yazd slaughterhouse, Yazd, Iran.In a nine-month retrospective survey from June 2011 to March 2012, all the carcasses and offal condemnations for large animals (cattle and camels) and small animals (sheep and goats) in Yazd Slaughterhouse were carefully recorded daily.In total, 2 741 large animals (cattle and camels) and 77 515 small animals (sheep and goats) were slaughtered during the period of this survey. Six carcasses (0.21%) of the large animals and 18 carcasses (0.02%) of the small animals were condemned. For large animals, condemnations in summer and autumn were significantly greater than winter (P<0.05). Condemnation rate of liver, lungs and kidneys for the large animals were 5.36%, 21.23% and 3.68% respectively and for the small animals were 4.37%, 5.46% and 0.51% respectively. The main recorded reasons for carcass condemnations in both large and small animals were icterus and cachexia. The most prevalent lesion resulting in offal condemnation was due to parasitic infection specially metacestods.This study aimed to show the efficiency of documentation records during meat inspection at slaughterhouses to monitor the amount of condemnation and possible approaches to better awareness about the future preventive programs. Considering the percentage of condemnation of carcass and offal in the present study and their price in Iranian markets, the overall economic losses seems to be notable at Yazd slaughterhouse.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautumn 3acachexia 3acamels 3acarcass condemnation 3acattle 3afinancial economics 3agoats 3akidneys 3aliver 3alungs 3amarkets 3aparasitoses 3aprices 3asheep 3aslaughterhouses 3asummer 3asurveys 3awinter 3aIran 0aCarcass 0aOffal 0aCondemnation 0aSlaughterhouse 0aYazd1 aOryan, A1 aZohourtabar, A1 aArdian, M1 aShokuhifar, M0 tAsian Pacific Journal of Tropical Biomedicine.g2014 Sept., v. 4 p.736-739dElsevier B.V.aHainan Medical Universityx2221-16917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.12980/APJTB.4.2014C12013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02784naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094024002200126024001900148040001800167100002500185245010400210300002000314506007600334520081000410592002801220506003701248650001801285650002601303650001301329650001501342650001301357650001501370650001601385650001601401653002501417653002601442653001301468653001101481653003601492700002001528700005901548700002401607700002101631700001701652700006001669700002001729700002101749700006001770700007201830700002201902700006501924773014101989856007902130852000902209655001202218IND60645703120221207104031.0190626e20190503xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064570312DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.9b032912doi7 aPMC67506402pmcid7 a310503972pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStrunk, Karl-Philipp10aPristine Poly(para-phenylene): Relating Semiconducting Behavior to Kinetics of Precursor Conversion  ap. 19481-19488.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWe investigated unsubstituted poly(para-phenylene) (PPP), a long-desired prototype of a conjugated polymer semiconductor. PPP was accessed via thermal aromatization of a precursor polymer bearing kinked, solubility-inducing dimethoxycyclohexadienylene moieties. IR spectroscopy and Vis ellipsometry studies revealed that the rate of conversion of the precursor to PPP increases with temperature and decreases with film density, indicating a process with high activation volume. The obtained PPP films were analyzed in thin-film transistors to gain insights into the interplay between the degree of conversion and the resulting p-type semiconducting properties. The semiconducting behavior of PPP was further unambiguously proven through IR and transistor measurements of molybdenum trioxide p-doped films.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aaromatization 3ainfrared spectroscopy 3amoieties 3amolybdenum 3apolymers 3aprototypes 3atemperature 3atransistors 0apoly(para-phenylene) 0athermal aromatization 0akinetics 0adoping 0aorganic field-effect transistor1 aAbdulkarim, Ali1 aBeck, Sebastian1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2194-68421 aMarszałek, Tomasz,1 aBernhardt, Jakob1 aKoser, Silke1 aPisula, Wojciech1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5853-18891 aJänsch, Daniel1 aFreudenberg, Jan1 aPucci, Annemarie1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9038-41101 aBunz, U.

Four isoproteic and isolipidic diets were formulated containing either 30 or 60 % of SPC (diets S30 and S60), supplemented or not with 1 % of taurine (diets S30T and S60T). A fishmeal-based diet formulated for totoaba nutritional requirements, without SPC and taurine supplementation, was used as a reference diet. Triplicate groups of 32 totoaba juveniles (average body weight 7.5 ± 0.6 g) were fed these diets for 45 days. Results showed that growth performance in fish fed S30, S30T, and S60T was similar to fish fed the reference diet. Red blood cells and hematocrit in fish fed with supplemented taurine in both levels of SPC (S30T and S60T) were similar to the fish fed the RD; the addition of taurine improved the state of hydration of totoaba. Plasmatic hemoglobin in fish fed the lower SPC level was similar to fish fed the RD. The mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration in fish fed S30T was similar to fish fed the RD, taurine supplementation prevented the development of hypochromic anemia in this group of fish. Plasmatic albumin in fish fed S30 was similar to fish fed the RD. Plasmatic total protein and globulin concentration increased and AL:GLB (albumin:globulin ratio) decreased in fish fed the SPC-based diets despite taurine supplementation. The protein profile showed that taurine supplementation did not prevent a possible inflammatory process (increased globulins, decreased AL:GLB) in juvenile totoaba fed both levels of SPC. Glucose concentration was similar in fish fed S30, S30T, and S60T. The histological hepatic index was highest in fish fed S60. These results suggest that with an appropriate nutritional level, taurine may play an important modulatory role in the hematology and blood biochemistry status in totoaba fed SPC-based diets, contributing to the enhancement of an overall healthy growth performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTotoaba macdonaldi 3aalbumins 3aanemia 3abody weight 3aerythrocytes 3afish 3afish meal 3aglobulins 3aglucose 3agrowth performance 3ahematocrit 3ahematology 3ahemoglobin 3ahistology 3ajuveniles 3aliver 3anutrient requirements 3aprotein content 3asoy protein concentrate 3ataurine1 aFlores-Ibarra, Maricela1 aBañuelos-Vargas, Isaura1 aGalaviz, Mario A.1 aTrue, Conal D.0 tFish physiology and biochemistry.g2015 Aug., v. 41, no. 4 p.921-936dSpringer Netherlandsx0920-17427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10695-015-0058-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01085naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245009100170300001600261520011600277592002800393650001600421650001600437650002800453650002300481651001400504653000900518653000800527773015400535856008500689852000900774655001200783IND60131007720221121031208.0151127e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013100772DNAL7 a10.4289/0013-8797.116.3.4022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMenke, Arnold S.12aA New Species of Red-Legged Pison in Australia (Hymenoptera, Crabronidae, Trypoxylini)  ap. 402-407.  aA new species of Pison from Australia is described and illustrated.

We estimated the contribution of NTFPs to rural household income in Zambia, and used a two-stage tobit alternative model to identify the factors associated with participation in NTFP markets. NTFPs accounted for 35 per cent of household income for participating households, second only to trading. Human capital variables and the value of assets were found to be significant determinants of both participation in business activities related to NTFPs and the associated household income, and the poor were more dependent on NTFPs than wealthier households. The effect of average rainfall underscores the role that NTFPs play in providing a safety net during periods of low crop yields. Rural development policies should recognize the role played by NTFPs in rural livelihoods and the need to balance welfare improvement and sustainable forest management.  aPublisher supplied data 3aassets 3abusiness enterprises 3aclimatic factors 3acrop yield 3adevelopment policy 3aeconometric models 3ahousehold income 3ahouseholds 3ahuman capital 3alivelihood 3amarkets 3anontimber forest products 3aparticipation (behavior) 3arain 3arural communities 3arural development 3arural economics 3arural families 3asales 3asocial welfare 3asustainable forestry 3aZambia1 aRichardson, Robert B.1 aTembo, Gelson1 aMapemba, Lawrence0 tEnvironment and development economics.g2014 Aug., v. 19, no. 4 p.487-504dCambridge University PresswJournal:2151x1469-43957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1355770X130005693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03054naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004000113040001800153100001800171245010200189300001600291520105600307592002801363650001801391650003001409650001501439650000901454650001501463650002501478650002201503650003101525650002501556650002301581650001901604650001601623650001901639650001101658650002601669650001401695650001001709650001901719650001301738650002301751650001601774650002401790650001901814650001901833650001101852650003101863650002401894650002801918650002401946650001901970653001501989653001702004653002602021653002202047653002502069700001202094700001702106700001702123700001402140773010602154856008702260852000902347655001202356IND50064875920221122225617.0190409e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006487592DNAL7 a234348042pmid7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2013.01.0672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Mingxin10aLife-cycle energy efficiency and environmental impacts of bioethanol production from sweet potato  ap. 285-292.  aLife-cycle assessment (LCA) was used to evaluate the energy efficiency and environmental impacts of sweet potato-based bioethanol production. The scope covered all stages in the life cycle of bioethanol production, including the cultivation and treatment, transport, as well as bioethanol conversion of sweet potato. Results show that the net energy ratio of sweet potato-based bioethanol is 1.48 and the net energy gain is 6.55MJ/L. Eutrophication is identified as the most significant environmental impact category, followed by acidification, global warming, human toxicity, and photochemical oxidation. Sensitivity analysis reveals that steam consumption during bioethanol conversion exerts the most effect on the results, followed by sweet potato yields and fertilizers input. It is suggested that substituting coal with cleaner energy for steam generation in bioethanol conversion stage and promotion of better management practices in sweet potato cultivation stage could lead to a significant improvement of energy and environmental performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidification 3abest management practices 3abioethanol 3acoal 3acrop yield 3adevelopmental stages 3aenergy efficiency 3aenergy use and consumption 3aenvironmental impact 3aethanol production 3aeutrophication 3afertilizers 3aglobal warming 3ahumans 3alife cycle assessment 3aoxidation 3asteam 3asweet potatoes 3atoxicity 2aBiofuelsxanalysis 2aEnvironment 2aEthanolxmetabolism 2aEutrophication 2aGlobal Warming 2aHumans 2aIpomoea batatasxchemistry 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aPhotochemical Processes 2aReference Standards 2aThermodynamics 0aBioethanol 0aSweet potato 0aLife-cycle assessment 0aEnergy efficiency 0aEnvironmental impact1 aShi, Yu1 aXia, Xunfeng1 aLi, Dinglong1 aChen, Qun0 tBioresource technology.g2013 Apr., v. 133 p.285-292dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2013.01.0673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02347naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004600094040001800140100002000158245016400178300001600342520088200358592002801240650001801268650002201286650001401308650002501322650001901347650002001366650002301386650001501409650002801424650000901452650001301461650002101474651001201495653001801507653002401525653000801549700003201557700002201589700002001611700001901631773013801650856009201788852000901880655001201889IND60555221720221119192505.0161026e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055522172DNAL7 a10.12980/APJTB.4.2014APJTB-2014-03922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEl-Akhal, Fouad10aChemical composition and larvicidal activity of essential oil of Origanum majorana (Lamiaceae) cultivated in Morocco against Culex pipiens (Diptera: Culicidae)  ap. 746-750.  aTo evaluate the larvicidal activity of essential oil of Origanum majorana (Lamiaceae) cultivated in Morocco against Culex pipiens (Diptera: Culicidae).The analysis and the identification of the various constituents of essential oil were carried out by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. Biological test was performed according to a standard methodology inspired by the World Health Organization protocol with slight modification.This oil mainly consisted of monoterpene and sesquiterpenes. The majority compounds are 4-terpinene (28.96%), γ-terpinene (18.57%), α-terpinene (12.72%) and sabinene (8.02%). The lethal concentrations (LC50 and LC90) measured for the essential oil Origanum majorana, were respectively of the order of 258.71 mg/L and 580.49 mg/L.The results could be useful in search for newer, safer, and more effective natural larvicidal agents.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCulex pipiens 3aOriganum majorana 3abioassays 3achemical composition 3aessential oils 3agamma-terpinene 3agas chromatography 3alarvicides 3alethal concentration 50 3aoils 3asabinene 3asesquiterpenoids 3aMorocco 0aEssential oil 0aLarvicidal activity 0aFez1 aLalami, Abdelhakim El Ouali1 aZoubi, Yassine Ez1 aGreche, Hassane1 aGuemmouh, Raja0 tAsian Pacific Journal of Tropical Biomedicine.g2014 Sept., v. 4 p.746-750dElsevier B.V.aHainan Medical Universityx2221-16917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.12980/APJTB.4.2014APJTB-2014-03923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03043naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100003700166245015200203300001800355500001500373520146700388592002801855650002201883650001701905650000801922650000901930650002001939650002201959650002801981650002502009650001102034650001902045650001802064650001302082650001502095650001302110650003202123650001702155650002802172653001002200653002502210700002202235700002902257700003802286700002802324773011602352856004802468852000902516655001202525IND50063291020221122225636.0130324e201302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006329102DNAL7 a233152092pmid7 a10.1007/s12010-012-0070-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThirugnanasambantham, Krishnaraj10aAnalysis of Dormant Bud (Banjhi) Specific Transcriptome of Tea (Camellia sinensis (L.)

O. Kuntze) plant growth and yield. Growth regulation associated with dormancy is an essential element in plant’s life cycle that leads to changes in expression of large number of genes. In order to identify and provide a picture of the transcriptome profile, cDNA library was constructed from dormant bud (banjhi) of tea. Sequence and gene ontology analysis of 3,500 clones, in many cases, enabled their functional categorization concerning the bud growth. Based on the cDNA library data, the putative role of identified genes from tea is discussed in relation to growth and dormancy, which includes morphogenesis, cellular differentiation, tropism, cell cycle, signaling, and various metabolic pathways. There was a higher representation of unknown processes such as unknown molecular functions (65.80 %), unknown biological processes (62.46 %), and unknown cellular components (67.42 %). However, these unknown transcripts represented a novel component of transcripts in tea plant bud growth and/or dormancy development. The identified transcripts and expressed sequence tags provides a valuable public resource and preliminary insights into the molecular mechanisms of bud dormancy regulation. Further, the findings will be the target of future expression experiments, particularly for further identification of dormancy-related genes in this species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCamellia sinensis 3aplant growth 3atea 3abuds 3atranscriptomics 3acomplementary DNA 3aexpressed sequence tags 3abiochemical pathways 3aclones 3acDNA libraries 3atranscriptome 3adormancy 3acell cycle 3atropisms 2aCamellia sinensisxgenetics 2aGene Library 2aTranscriptomexgenetics 0agenes 0anucleotide sequences1 aPrabu, Gajjeraman1 aPalanisamy, Senthilkumar1 aChandrabose, Suresh Ramraj Subhas1 aMandal, Abul Kalam Azad0 tApplied biochemistry and biotechnology.g2013 Feb., v. 169, no. 4 p.1405-1417dSpringer-Verlagx0273-22897nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12010-012-0070-5  aDNAL 7aarticle03093naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001900145245012800164300001800292500001400310500002000324520155700344592002801901650001901929650001501948650001801963650002001981650001402001650002002015650004202035650002702077650001302104650001702117650001402134650001502148650001402163650001202177700002402189700002102213700002302234700002202257700001802279700003202297700002002329700002402349773012602373856007902499852000902578655001202587IND60722306720221116185210.0210101e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072230672DNAL7 a10.1111/1755-0998.120032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDe Wit, Pierre14aThe simple fool's guide to population genomics via RNA‐Seq: an introduction to high‐throughput sequencing data analysis  ap. 1058-1067.  aNAL-light  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aHigh‐throughput sequencing technologies are currently revolutionizing the field of biology and medicine, yet bioinformatic challenges in analysing very large data sets have slowed the adoption of these technologies by the community of population biologists. We introduce the ‘Simple Fool's Guide to Population Genomics via RNA‐seq’ (SFG), a document intended to serve as an easy‐to‐follow protocol, walking a user through one example of high‐throughput sequencing data analysis of nonmodel organisms. It is by no means an exhaustive protocol, but rather serves as an introduction to the bioinformatic methods used in population genomics, enabling a user to gain familiarity with basic analysis steps. The SFG consists of two parts. This document summarizes the steps needed and lays out the basic themes for each and a simple approach to follow. The second document is the full SFG, publicly available at http://sfg.stanford.edu, that includes detailed protocols for data processing and analysis, along with a repository of custom‐made scripts and sample files. Steps included in the SFG range from tissue collection to de novo assembly, blast annotation, alignment, gene expression, functional enrichment, SNP detection, principal components and FST outlier analyses. Although the technical aspects of population genomics are changing very quickly, our hope is that this document will help population biologists with little to no background in high‐throughput sequencing and bioinformatics to more quickly adopt these new techniques.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioinformatics 3abiologists 3adata analysis 3adata collection 3adetection 3agene expression 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3ainformation processing 3amedicine 3ametagenomics 3aorganisms 3apopulation 3aprotocols 3awalking1 aPespeni, Melissa H.1 aLadner, Jason T.1 aBarshis, Daniel J.1 aSeneca, François1 aJaris, Hannah1 aTherkildsen, Nina Overgaard1 aMorikawa, Megan1 aPalumbi, Stephen R.0 tMolecular ecology resources.g2012 Nov., v. 12, no. 6 p.1058-1067dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:12383x1755-098X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1755-0998.120033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02331naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092024002200134024001900156040001800175100001600193245011300209300001600322506007600338520127000414592002801684506003701712650001301749650001301762650001801775650001401793650000901807700001801816773009501834856005501929852000901984655001201993IND4501494620221207133916.0150416e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND450149462DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1541-0420.2010.01542.x2doi7 aPMC31377322pmcid7 a212812732pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Ying10aInformative Cluster Sizes for SubclusterâLevel Covariates and Weighted Generalized Estimating Equations  ap. 843-851.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWilliamson, Datta, and Satten's (2003,âBiometricsâ59, 36â42) clusterâweighted generalized estimating equations (CWGEEs) are effective in adjusting for bias due to informative cluster sizes for clusterâlevel covariates. We show that CWGEE may not perform well, however, for covariates that can take different values within a cluster if the numbers of observations at each covariate level are informative. On the other hand, inverse probability of treatment weighting accounts for informative treatment propensity but not for informative cluster size. Motivated by evaluating the effect of a binary exposure in presence of such types of informativeness, we propose several weighted GEE estimators, with weights related to the size of a cluster as well as the distribution of the binary exposure within the cluster. Choice of the weights depends on the population of interest and the nature of the exposure. Through simulation studies, we demonstrate the superior performance of the new estimators compared to existing estimators such as from GEE, CWGEE, and inverse probability of treatmentâweighted GEE. We demonstrate the use of our method using an example examining covariate effects on the risk of dental caries among small children.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abiometry 3achildren 3adental caries 3aequations 3arisk1 aLeroux, Brian0 tBiometrics.g2011 Sept., v. 67, no. 3 p.843-851dBlackwell Publishing Incx0006-341X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1541-0420.2010.01542.x  aDNAL 7aarticle03186naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001200145245010400157300001800261500001400279500002000293520148800313592002801801596002701829650001101856650002501867650001201892650002201904650001301926650004201939650002101981650001402002650001102016650002702027650001702054650001302071650001302084650003502097650001102132650001802143650002002161650001602181650001302197651001402210651000902224651003102233700001302264700001302277700001402290700001402304700002102318700001602339700001502355773012602370856007902496852000902575655001202584IND60722306820221116185353.0210101e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072230682DNAL7 a10.1111/1755-0998.120142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, J.13aDe novo assembly of the transcriptome of an invasive snail and its multiple ecological applications  ap. 1133-1144.  aNAL-light  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aStudying how invasive species respond to environmental stress at the molecular level can help us assess their impact and predict their range expansion. Development of markers of genetic polymorphism can help us reconstruct their invasive route. However, to conduct such studies requires the presence of substantial amount of genomic resources. This study aimed to generate and characterize genomic resources using high throughput transcriptome sequencing for Pomacea canaliculata, a nonmodel gastropod indigenous to Argentina that has invaded Asia, Hawaii and southern United States. De novo assembly of the transcriptome resulted in 128 436 unigenes with an average length of 419 bp (range: 150–8556 bp). Many of the unigenes (2439) contained transposable elements, showing the existence of a source of genetic variability in response to stressful conditions. A total of 3196 microsatellites were detected in the transcriptome; among 20 of the randomly tested microsatellites, 10 were validated to exhibit polymorphism. A total of 15 412 single‐nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were detected in the ORFs. LC‐MS/MS analysis of the proteome of juveniles revealed 878 proteins, of which many are stress related. This study has demonstrated the great potential of high throughput DNA sequencing for rapid development of genomic resources for a nonmodel organism. Such resources can facilitate various molecular ecological studies, such as stress physiology and range expansion.  aPublisher supplied data  aFRG2/10‐11/009cHKBU 3aHawaii 3aPomacea canaliculata 3aecology 3agenetic variation 3agenomics 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3ainvasive species 3ajuveniles 3alength 3amicrosatellite repeats 3apolymorphism 3aproteins 3aproteome 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3asnails 3atranscriptome 3atranscriptomics 3atransposons 3aunigenes 3aArgentina 3aAsia 3aSoutheastern United States1 aWang, M.1 aWang, H.1 aZhang, H.1 aZhang, X.1 aThiyagarajan, V.1 aQian, P.

The present study reports that the matrix has a critical regulating effect on MSC differentiation and the subsequent bone formation modes. A simply combined hydroxyapatite (HA)-collagen matrix stimulates the MSC differentiation into the osteoblastic lineage and leads to a straightforward intramembranous bone formation mode, in contrast to the chondrocytic differentiation and endochondral mode observed on HA-synthetic hydrogel matrix. The accelerated MSC condensation and robust MSC-matrix and MSC–MSC interactions on collagen-based matrix might be the critical factors contributing to such events, likely through the orchestrated signal cascades and cellular events modulated by the extracellular matrix. The results demonstrate that matrix plays critical role in modulating the stem cell differentiation lineage and bone formation mode, which has been largely overlooked.  aPublisher supplied data 3askeletal development 3amorphogenesis 3ahydroxyapatite 3ahydrocolloids 3abone formation 3astem cells 3askeleton 3acell differentiation 3aextracellular matrix 0acondensation1 aJiang, Bo1 aDai, Yun1 aHao, Jianyuan1 aZhou, Zongke1 aTian, Zhili1 aWu, Fang1 aGu, Zhongwei0 tBiomaterials.g2013 Sept., v. 34, no. 28 p.6580-6588dElsevier Ltdx0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.05.0563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01274naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245003200159300001600191500000900207520048400216592002800700650002300728650001500751650002300766651001900789773010600808856007300914852000900987655001200996IND60519953120221119015214.0160511e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051995312DNAL7 a10.1111/nbu.122112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aButtriss, J.

All developmental stages of the microsporidium are diplokaryotic and in direct contact with the host cell cytoplasm. Giemsa-stained mature spores are oval in shape and measured 3.82 ± 0.35 μm in length and 2.54 ± 0.27 μm in width. The polar filament of the binucleate spores is isofilar with 12–14 coils. Coils are 140.28 ± 4.88 nm (135.59–147.06; n = 36) in diameter and consist of six concentric layers of different electron density and thickness. The spores have a relatively thick (161.72 ± 29.19 nm) trilaminar spore wall. Morphological, ultrastructural and molecular features indicate that the described microsporidium belongs to the genus Nosema and is named Nosema alticae sp. nov.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAltica 3aNosema 3acytoplasm 3adevelopmental stages 3aentomopathogenic fungi 3afungal spores 3anew species 3aribosomal DNA 0aAltica hampei 0aChrysomelidae 0aDiplokaryotic 0aMicrosporidia 0aPathogen1 aBekircan, Çağrı0 tJournal of invertebrate pathology.g2020 Feb., v. 170 p.107302-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45771x0022-20117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jip.2019.1073023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02728naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002000143245012800163520119700291592002801488650002301516650002201539650002301561650002501584650002801609650003201637650001601669650002601685650001301711650002201724650001801746650001001764650002301774650001901797650002201816650001601838650001601854650002201870650001601892650001501908700001901923700002001942700001601962700001901978700001901997773011902016856007802135852000902213655001202222IND60763428420221122144051.0220120e20220112xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076342842DNAL7 a10.3390/foods110201952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Shanshan 10aAntifungal Activity of Lactobacillus plantarum ZZUA493 and Its Application to Extend the Shelf Life of Chinese Steamed Buns  aLactic acid bacteria (LAB) can produce many kinds of antifungal substances, which have been widely proven to have antifungal activity. In this study, 359 strains of LAB were screened for antifungal activity against Aspergillus niger (A. niger) using the 96-well microtiter plate method, and three showed strong activity. Of these, ZZUA493 showed a broad-spectrum antifungal ability against A. niger, Aspergillus oryzae, Trichoderma longibrachiatum, Aspergillus flavus and Fusarium graminearum. ZZUA493 was identified as Lactobacillus plantarum. Protease treatment, the removal of hydrogen peroxide with catalase and heat treatment had no effect on the antifungal activity of the cell-free supernatant (CFS) of ZZUA493; organic acids produced by ZZUA493 appeared to have an important role in fungal growth inhibition. The contents of lactic acid, acetic acid and phenyllactic acid in the CFS tended to be stable at 48 h, and amounted to 28.5, 15.5 and 0.075 mg/mL, respectively. In addition, adding ZZUA493, as an ingredient during their preparation, prolonged the shelf life of Chinese steamed buns. Overall, ZZUA493 appears to have good potential as a fungal inhibitor for food preservation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus flavus 3aAspergillus niger 3aAspergillus oryzae 3aFusarium graminearum 3aLactobacillus plantarum 3aTrichoderma longibrachiatum 3aacetic acid 3aantifungal properties 3acatalase 3afood preservation 3afungal growth 3afungi 3agrowth retardation 3aheat treatment 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aingredients 3alactic acid 3aphenyllactic acid 3aproteinases 3ashelf life1 aHao, Xiangmei 1 aYang, Fengyuan 1 aWang, Yuan 1 aFan, Xiaomiao 1 aWang, Yanping 0 tFoods.g2022 Jan. 12, v. 11, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods110201953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02887naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002200145245009300167300001600260520172700276592002802003650001302031650002502044650001202069650003102081650001502112650001102127650001302138650001802151650001102169650001302180650002102193650001202214650001302226650002102239700001902260700001802279700001502297773009602312856004802408852000902456655001202465IND4487725020221120141240.0120727e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448772502DNAL7 a10.1007/s11119-010-9211-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPÃ©rez-Ruiz, M.10aAssessing GNSS correction signals for assisted guidance systems in agricultural vehicles  ap. 639-652.  aAccuracy levels achieved with differential global positioning system (DGPS) receivers in agricultural operations depend upon the quality of the correction signal. This study has assessed differential signal error from a Dedicated Base Station, OmniSTAR VBS, European Geostationary Navigation Overlay System, European reference frame-IP for internet protocol (EUREF-IP) and radio navigation satellite aided technique (RASANT). These signals were utilized in guidance assisting systems for agricultural applications, such as tillage, harvesting, planting and spraying, in which GPS receivers were used under dynamic conditions. Simulations of agricultural operations on different days and at different time slots and simultaneously recording the tractorâ²s geo-position from a DGPS receiver and the tractorâ²s geo-position from a real-time kinematic (RTK) GPS allowed the comparison of the GPS correction signals. The hardware used for tractor guidance was a lightbar (Trimble model EZ-Guide Plus) system. ANOVA statistics showed a significant difference between the accuracy of the correction signals from different sources. GPS correction signal recommendations to farmers depend upon the accuracy required for the specific operation: (a) Yield monitoring and soil sampling (<1Â m) are possible with all the GPS correction signals accessed in any time slot. (b) Broadcast seeding, fertilizer and herbicide application (<0.5Â m) are possible for 80% of time with OmniSTAR VBS, 40% of time with RASANT and EUREF-IP and 100% of time with a dedicated base station. (c) Transplanting and drill seeding (<0.04Â m) are not possible with the accuracy correction provided by any one of the systems used in this study.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3aanalysis of variance 3afarmers 3aglobal positioning systems 3aharvesting 3amodels 3aplanting 3asoil sampling 3asowing 3aspraying 3asteering systems 3atillage 3atractors 3ayield monitoring1 aCarballido, J.1 aAgÃ¼era, J.1 aGil, J.

This study sheds light on the mechanism by which the modulation of the chemical composition of calcium silicate cements with different Si/Ca molar ratios could produce different cell responses. Two primary cell types (human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) and human dental pulp cells (hDPCs)) were used to elicit the changes in total DNA content, integrin subunit levels, phosphor-focal adhesion kinase (pFAK) levels, and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway activity at the cell attachment stage. The effect of small interfering RNA (siRNA) transfection targeting collagen type I (COL I) and fibronectin (FN) was also evaluated. The results indicated that increased total DNA content, pFAK and total integrin levels were observed upon an increase in cement Si content. Cements with different Si/Ca ratios did not cause the variations of interleukin 1β (IL-1β), epidermal growth factor (EGF) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) ligands. The Si-rich cement facilitated COL I and α2β1 subintegrin expression, while Ca-rich cement promoted FN and αvβ3 subintegrin expression. Si component of the calcium silicates stimulated cell adhesion via activation of MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and p38 signaling pathways more effectively than did by Ca component, but it did not affect c-Jun NH₂-terminal kinase (JNK) activity. Inhibition of MAPK/ERK and MAPK/p38 signaling pathways in hMSCs and hDPCs significantly attenuated adhesion, proliferation and differentiation as assessed according to total DNA content and alkaline phosphatase activity. hMSCs and hDPCs from the three different donors exhibited a similar preference for cell behaviors. The results of the current study suggest that calcium silicate cements with a higher Si content have the potential to serve as excellent supports for primary cells. Unraveling the mechanism by which primary cells responded to calcium silicate materials will be beneficial for materials design in their eventual clinical use.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aadhesion 3aalkaline phosphatase 3acalcium 3acalcium silicate 3acell adhesion 3acement 3achemical composition 3acollagen 3aepidermal growth factor 3afibronectins 3ahumans 3aintegrins 3ainterleukin-1beta 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3asignal transduction 3asilicon 3asmall interfering RNA 3astem cells 3atooth pulp 3atransfection 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha1 aDing, Shinn-Jyh0 tBiomaterials.g2013 Sept., v. 34, no. 28 p.6589-6606dElsevier Ltdx0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.05.0753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02303naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100003100152245008200183500001400265520111600279592002801395650001601423650001901439650001401458650001901472650002401491650002001515650001401535653002201549653003501571653003601606653004201642653002901684653002001713773010001733856008701833852000901920655001201929IND60714970820221120180444.0210415e20210416xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071497082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2020.1283252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAshogbon, Adeleke Omodunbi10aDual modification of various starches: Synthesis, properties and applications  aNAL-light  aThe problems associated with native starches (NSs) and single modified starches were stated in order to justify dual modification of various starches. Broadly, there are two types of dual modification, i.e., homogeneous dual modification and heterogeneous dual modification. The combination of two physical modifications, e.g., (extrusion/annealing); two chemical modifications, e.g., (succinylation/cross-linking) and two enzymes modification (α-amylase/pullulanase) falls under the former classification and the latter classification is the combination of two of each of the differently stated modifications, e.g., acetylation/annealing, extrusion/succinylation, and microwave-assisted phosphorylation, etc. The classification, synthesis, properties and applications of dually modified starches were discussed. There is an attempt to elucidate the problems of each of the single modification in order to justify dual modifications. In dual modifications, the order of reactions, the reaction conditions, the medium of reaction, and the botanical sources of the various starches are very important parameters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetylation 3aclassification 3aextrusion 3afood chemistry 3amicrowave treatment 3aphosphorylation 3asynthesis 0aDual modification 0aMicrowave-assisted acetylation 0aSuccinylated crosslinked starch 0aHeat moisture treated annealed starch 0aDual enzyme modification 0aHydroxyl groups0 tFood chemistry.g2021 Apr. 16, v. 342 p.128325-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2020.1283253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03715naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003000111040001800141072000900159100001900168245013400187300001600321500002400337520165000361650002602011650002002037650001902057650001802076650002702094650001202121650002102133650002502154650001702179650001502196650001502211650002102226650001902247650002602266650001202292650001102304650003102315650004002346650002802386650004202414650000902456650001002465650002202475650002802497650002202525650001702547653002002564653001802584653002302602653002402625653003102649700002502680700001902705700002202724773012302746852000902869856008002878930003302958945002502991946001303016655001203029IND4420111720221122232921.0090508e200902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442011172DNAL7 a192536682pmid7 a10.1603/029.102.01592doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF8511 aBaxter, Ian H.10aUsing Image Analysis to Design a Prototype Autodissemination Device Intended for the Biorational Control of Plodia Interpunctella  ap. 453-465.  aIncludes references  aThe extent to which a carrier powder was taken up and horizontally transferred by contaminated Indianmeal moth, Plodia interpunctella (Hübner) individuals to conspecifics was evaluated. Using a marker dye, which was shown to be colocalized with the carrier powder, the amount of powder on the Indianmeal moth, as determined by spectrophotometry, was correlated with quantification based on a novel image analysis approach that enabled differentiation of powder uptake by body region. Over a 48-h period, more powder was retained on the ventral surface than the dorsal side, with the head region showing the greatest amount of powder uptake and retention. During courtship, powder was horizontally transferred by treated males to 1.6% of the head and 0.06% of the untreated females' body. To inoculate moths, a pit-fall style autodissemination station was determined as being more effective than a powder tray, as significantly more material was taken up to the key areas of the moth's body where powder is more effectively retained and more likely to be horizontally transferred. Additionally, a pit-fall station prevented moths from exhibiting avoidance behavior from the powder, which was frequently encountered if they had to walk into a powder tray.This study shows that different regions of the Indianmeal moth body vary in capacity to carry powder and that future research efforts should target these specific regions. Although the proposed autodissemination system was optimized for management strategies of Indianmeal moth, we believe the results presented here can be used to develop novel management strategies for other insect pests. 3aPlodia interpunctella 3astorage insects 3ainsect control 3abiopesticides 3apesticide formulations 3apowders 3afluorescent dyes 3aspatial distribution 3abody regions 3adispensers 3aprototypes 3aequipment design 3aimage analysis 3aquantitative analysis 2aAnimals 2aFemale 2aFluorescent Dyesxanalysis 2aImage Processing, Computer-Assisted 2aInsect Controlxmethods 2aInsecticidesxadministration & dosage 2aMale 2aMoths 2aPowdersxanalysis 2aSexual Behavior, Animal 2aSpectrophotometry 2aTime Factors 0acarrier powders 0apowder uptake 0apesticide transfer 0ahorizontal transfer 0aautodissemination stations1 aSchuppe, Hansjürgen1 aJackson, Chris1 aNansen, Christian0 tJournal of economic entomology.g2009 Feb., v. 102, no. 1 p.453-465dEntomological Society of Americax0022-04937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603/029.102.01593Available from publisher's Web site  a20090618b20090703c00000000  aINDdNZMe2009/06/17  aOther US 7aarticle02965naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245013100155300001600286520174200302592002802044650001002072650001102082650001402093650003102107650001002138650001302148650001302161650002302174650002902197650001502226650001102241650000902252700001402261700001702275700001402292700001502306773015102321856007402472852000902546655001202555IND60163245420221121110311.0150530e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6016324542DNAL7 a10.1111/ajgw.121372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTomasi, N.10aInduction of nitrate uptake in Sauvignon Blanc and Chardonnay grapevines depends on the scion and is affected by the rootstock  ap. 331-338.  aBACKGROUND AND AIMS: Nitrate is a major form of inorganic nitrogen present in cultivated soils; however, information on the mechanisms responsible for uptake of the anion in grapevines is scarce. METHODS AND RESULTS: The response to external nitrate was studied in two clones of the cultivars Chardonnay and Sauvignon Blanc. Grapevines, own‐rooted or grafted on the two rootstocks SO4 and K5BB, were grown in nutrient solution and, after a period of nitrogen (N)‐deprivation, exposed to 0.2 or 1 mmol/L nitrate. The uptake was an inducible process, operated by high‐ and low‐affinity transport systems. The magnitude and time dependence of the induction varied as a function of the clone. Uptake rate as a function of nitrate external concentration showed a multiphasic pattern. Although nitrate exposure caused a transient up‐regulation of nitrate influx transporter genes, a clear correlation with the rise in nitrate uptake could not be found; in contrast, a negative relationship between changes in uptake rates and expression of a nitrate efflux transporter gene was observed. CONCLUSIONS: In the grapevine, the response of low‐ and high‐affinity transport systems to external nitrate was favoured by the presence of the rootstock and also dependent on the characteristics of the scion. Low‐affinity uptake and efflux from root cells conceivably play an important role in the overall N‐nitrate acquisition. SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY: This study shows that activation of mechanisms involved in nitrate uptake in the grapevine is strongly affected by the scion–rootstock combination. Results may be significant for developing agronomic practices and selection programmes related to nitrogen use in the grapevine.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVitis 3aclones 3acultivars 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3anitrates 3anitrogen 3anutrient solutions 3aplant cultural practices 3arootstocks 3ascions 3asoil1 aMonte, R.1 aVaranini, Z.1 aCesco, S.1 aPinton, R.0 tAustralian journal of grape and wine research.g2015 June, v. 21, no. 2 p.331-338dAustralian Society of Viticulture and Oenologyx1322-71307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ajgw.121373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01956naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245004800157300001600205500000900221520083200230592002801062650001501090650002801105650002001133650000901153650001001162650001101172650001801183650001601201650002101217650001301238650001401251650002501265650002301290650000901313650001201322651001201334773010601346856007301452852000901525655001201534IND60519953320221119015346.0160511e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051995332DNAL7 a10.1111/nbu.122032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNugent, A.

Other areas include the influence of genetics, diet and lifestyle on diet and health outcomes, targeted programmes to assist lifestyle change in ‘at risk’ groups, such as those at risk of cardiovascular disease. Irish researchers are also collaborating with the food industry to identify and characterise functional foods and bioactives, which can be commercialised. Much of this research feeds into European Union‐wide ventures ranging from Joint Programme Initiatives to the activities of the European Food Safety Authority.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomarkers 3acardiovascular diseases 3adata collection 3adiet 3afeeds 3aflavor 3afood industry 3afood safety 3afunctional foods 3agenetics 3alifestyle 3anutrition assessment 3anutrition research 3arisk 3asurveys 3aIreland0 tNutrition bulletin.g2016 June, v. 41, no. 2 p.147-150dBritish Nutrition Foundationx1471-98277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/nbu.122033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03323naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245013200168506010400300506007600404520181100480592002802291506003702319650002302356650001602379650001602395650001002411650001202421650000902433650001402442650000902456650001302465650002002478650000902498651001102507653002102518653001102539653001402550653002202564653001802586700006302604773010402667856008502771852000902856655001202865IND60765912020221207055417.0220606e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076591202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2022.1127792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLidman, Johan14aThe effect of aquatic and terrestrial prey availability on metal accumulation in pied flycatcher (Ficedula hypoleuca) nestlings  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIngestion of contaminated prey is a major route for metal exposure in terrestrial insectivores. In terrestrial ecosystems adjacent to lakes and streams, emerging aquatic insects can transport metals, accumulated during their larval stage, from aquatic to terrestrial ecosystems. However, contaminant exposure via aquatic insects has often been ignored in terrestrial environments, despite such insects representing a substantial part of the diet for terrestrial insectivores living close to lakes and streams. In this study, we investigated how dietary lead (Pb) and calcium (Ca) exposure from different aquatic and terrestrial prey types affects Pb accumulation in pied flycatcher (Ficedula hypoleuca) nestlings living close to a former Pb/zinc (Zn) mine in northern Sweden, which closed in 2001. Stable isotope analysis (δ ¹³C and δ¹⁵N) of nestling blood and different prey types was used to estimate nestlings' diet. Ants, Lepidoptera larvae and Trichoptera were the most common prey types in the nestlings’ diet, in which aquatic prey types (Trichoptera included) accounted for 2.0–96.4%. Ingestion of specific prey groups, such as aquatic insects and ants, were important for Pb accumulation in nestlings, and when access to aquatic prey was low, ants were the predominant source of Pb. The influence of dietary Ca on Pb accumulation was less consistent, but Ca availability was relatively high and often co-occurred with high Pb concentrations in invertebrates. The study shows that both the proportion of different prey and their individual metal concentrations need to be considered when estimating exposure risks for insectivores. Further, it highlights the need to account for metal exposure from emerging aquatic insects for terrestrial insectivores living close to lakes and streams.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aFicedula hypoleuca 3aLepidoptera 3aTrichoptera 3ablood 3acalcium 3adiet 3aingestion 3alead 3aresearch 3astable isotopes 3azinc 3aSweden 0aDietary exposure 0aMetals 0aPasserine 0aAquatic subsidies 0aInvertebrates1 aBerglund, Åsa M.M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7926-21200 tEnvironmental research.g2022 June, v. 209 p.112779-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12442x0013-93517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2022.1127793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02616naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001300143245014200156520139800298592002801696650001601724650001401740650001701754650001101771650002001782650001501802650001401817650000901831650001101840650001801851650003101869650001501900700001701915700001701932700001401949700001801963700001901981773011902000856007802119852000902197655001202206IND60763428720221122144045.0220120e20220112xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076342872DNAL7 a10.3390/foods110202002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Lu 12aA Comparative Analysis of Lipid Digestion in Human Milk and Infant Formulas Based on Simulated In Vitro Infant Gastrointestinal Digestion  aTo investigate the lipid digestive behaviors of human and infant formulas and analyze the differences between them, we investigated the fat globule particle size distribution, lipolysis rate, and fatty acid release of infant formulas with different fat sources and human milk using an in vitro infant digestion model. The results suggested that the particle size in infant formula increased rapidly during gastric digestion and decreased significantly after intestinal digestion, whereas the particle size in human milk increased slowly during gastric digestion but increased rapidly during intestinal digestion (p < 0.05). Despite having a larger droplet size, human milk demonstrated a very high lipolysis rate due to the presence of MFGM. In terms of the distribution of fatty acids in digestion products, the proportion of saturated fatty acids (SFAs), monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in vegetable oil-based infant formulas was close to that of human milk. The amount of SFAs in milk fat-based infant formulas was significantly higher than that in human milk, and the content of MUFAs in all infant formulas was significantly lower than that in human milk (p < 0.05). After digestion, the most abundant fatty acid released by human milk was C18:2n6c, while the fatty acids released by infant formulas were SFAs, such as C14:0, C16:0, and C18:0.  aPublisher supplied data 3abreast milk 3adigestion 3adroplet size 3ahumans 3ainfant formulas 3aintestines 3alipolysis 3amilk 3amodels 3aparticle size 3aparticle size distribution 3avegetables1 aLin, Shuang 1 aMa, Shuaiyi 1 aSun, Yue 1 aLi, Xiaodong 1 aLiang, Shuyan 0 tFoods.g2022 Jan. 12, v. 11, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods110202003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02682naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245016100167300001600328520112500344592002801469650002101497650001401518650001801532650001101550650001101561650002301572650001901595650004101614650001801655650001401673650001201687650002301699650002301722650001101745650001001756653001301766653001701779653001401796653001101810653002601821653003501847700001401882700001501896700001501911700001701926700001701943773009501960856008802055852000902143655001202152IND60479784520221119091248.0160123e20110101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047978452DNAL7 a10.1556/AAlim.40.2011.Suppl.132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNovák, I.10aEffect of the drying method on the composition of <i>Origanum vulgare</i> L. subsp. <i>hirtum</i> essential oil analysed by GC-MS and sensory profile method  ap. 130-138.  aIn the case of a widely used spice — <i>Origanum vulgare</i> subsp. <i>hirtum</i> — the effect of different drying methods (natural, and by using dryers at temperatures of 30°C, 40 °C, 45°C) was investigated referring to the essential oil amount and composition in the final material. The sensory characteristics of olive oils flavoured by the oregano samples were also determined. The essential oil amount and the area percentage of its main component — carvacrol — were significantly influenced by the different drying temperatures. Compared to the natural way of drying in the case of the essential oil content the drying temperature of 40°C and 45°C was preferable for the higher amounts. Referring to the carvacrol area percentage the drying temperature of 30°C resulted in the highest amounts (89.74±0.28%), that was affirmed by the sensory analysis as well; based on the taste descriptions the consumers found it the most pungent one. According to our results sensory analysis data in most of the cases corresponds to the GC-MS measurements and give a much more complex characterisation of a spice.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOriganum vulgare 3acarvacrol 3adata analysis 3adryers 3adrying 3adrying temperature 3aessential oils 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3alipid content 3aolive oil 3aoregano 3asensory evaluation 3asensory properties 3aspices 3ataste 0aoriganum 0avolatile oil 0acarvacrol 0adrying 0atrained sensory panel 0acomputerized sensory profiling1 aSipos, L.1 aKókai, Z.1 aSzabó, K.1 aPluhár, Zs.1 aSárosi, Sz.0 tActa alimentaria.g2011 Jan. 1, v. 40, no. 0 p.130-138dAkadémiai Kiadóx0139-30067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1556%2FAAlim.40.2011.Suppl.133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02051naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245014200161300001400303520073000317592002801047650001401075650001901089650001501108650001501123650001701138650002301155650002001178650001401198650001001212651001401222651001001236653001501246653001701261653001401278653001701292653001301309700001601322700002101338700001901359773013601378856008201514852000901596655001201605IND60543666820221121032443.0190411e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054366682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.myc.2014.02.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeng, Hui10aCurvularia tsudae comb. nov. et nom. nov., formerly Pseudocochliobolus australiensis, and a revised synonymy for Curvularia australiensis  ap. 24-28.  aCultures originally identified as Drechslera australiensis, from seeds of Chloris gayana in Japan, were the basis for Tsuda and Ueyama's new combination, Bipolaris australiensis, and its associated sexual morph Pseudocochliobolus australiensis.

This is especially true if the microarray experiment is from an ecological study of multiple populations. Comparisons across populations may also contain important genomic polymorphisms, and a subset of these polymorphisms may be identified with microarrays using techniques for the detection of single feature polymorphisms (SFP). SFPs are differences in microarray probe level intensities caused by genetic polymorphisms such as single‐nucleotide polymorphisms and small insertions/deletions and not expression differences. In this study, we provide a new algorithm for the detection of SFPs, evaluate the algorithm using existing data from two publicly available Affymetrix Barley (Hordeum vulgare) microarray data sets and compare them to two previously published SFP detection algorithms. Results show that our algorithm provides more consistent and sensitive calling of SFPs with a lower false discovery rate. Simultaneous analysis of SFPs and differential expression is a low‐cost method for the enhanced analysis of microarray data, enabling additional biological inferences to be made.  aPublisher supplied data  a5P20RR016448‐10cNational Center for Research Resources  a8 P20 GM103397‐10cNational Institute of General Medical Sciences  cNational Institutes of Health  cNSF Idaho EPSCoR Program  aEPS‐0447689cNational Science Foundation 3aHordeum vulgare 3aalgorithms 3abarley 3adata collection 3adetection 3agene expression regulation 3agenetic variation 3agenomics 3ainformation 3amicroarray technology 3aoligonucleotides 3apopulation 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism1 aCoram, Tristan1 aSoule, Terence1 aRobison, Barrie D.0 tMolecular ecology resources.g2012 Nov., v. 12, no. 6 p.1079-1089dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:12383x1755-098X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1755-0998.120063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03335naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001500139245016300154300001600317520181700333592002802150650001102178650001702189650001402206650002402220650001302244650001202257650001602269650001002285650001402295650002902309650001502338650001702353650001302370650001302383650001802396650003102414650002002445650002202465650001402487700001702501700001502518700002002533700001302553700001802566700001302584700002002597773010602617856007302723852000902796655001202805IND60519953520221119015307.0160511e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051995352DNAL7 a10.1111/nbu.121992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPorter, J.14aThe effect of dietary interventions and nutritional supplementation on bone mineral density in otherwise healthy adults with osteopenia: A systematic review  ap. 108-121.  aThere are many health and economic consequences for patients with osteopenia, the precursor to osteoporosis. A range of treatments may provide positive outcomes for otherwise healthy adults, including dietary and exercise approaches, either alone or in combination. The primary aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the effect of dietary approaches (including diet alone, diet with dietary supplements, both with or without physical activity intervention) on bone mineral density (BMD) to treat adults aged ≥18 years who were classified as having osteopenia. Six databases (Ovid MEDLINE including Ovid Medline in process, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, CINAHL Plus, Web of Science and Scopus) were searched systematically to identify randomised controlled trials of dietary approaches to treat osteopenic adults published from 1994 to November 2014. Study eligibility was determined, and included studies were assessed for risk of bias. Outcome data, particularly the primary outcomes of BMD T‐ and Z‐scores or other measures of bone density, were combined narratively. The searches yielded 3511 papers, with three studies fulfilling the inclusion criteria. These studies included 254 participants, all free‐living post‐menopausal females with confirmed osteopenia. Vitamin D interventions were tested in all included studies, with none showing significant differences between intervention and placebo groups on BMD. This review has identified a lack of evidence to guide clinical practice in this area. Opportunities exist for future research to determine the effect of non‐pharmacological approaches to osteopenia treatment in healthy populations, especially research that considers younger‐aged and male populations, physical activity, habitual dietary intake and key bone health nutrients.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3abone density 3adatabases 3adietary supplements 3aexercise 3afemales 3afood intake 3amales 3anutrients 3anutritional intervention 3aosteopenia 3aosteoporosis 3apatients 3aplacebos 3apostmenopause 3arandomized clinical trials 3arisk assessment 3asystematic review 3avitamin D1 aAdderley, M.1 aBonham, M.1 aCosta, R.

The development of rapid, sensitive and specific detection technology of food pollutants is one of the hot issues in food science field. The rapid development of functionalized Fe₃O₄ nanoparticles (NPs) provides unprecedented opportunities and technical support for the innovation of food safety detection. The surface functionalized Fe₃O₄ NPs, which combine superparamagnetic with nanoscale feature, have become an excellent tool for food quality and safety detection. This review highlights the mechanism, principles, and applications of surface functionalized Fe₃O₄ NPs-based detection technique in the agrifood industry. Then the relevant characteristics, functional roles and general mechanisms of nanomaterial-based detection of various endogenous components and exogenous pollutants in foods are discussed in detail. Ultimately, this review is expected to promote the optimization of functionalized Fe₃O₄ NPs and provide direction for the diversity of signal recognition and the sustainability of detection methods.  aPublisher supplied data 3adetection 3afood chemistry 3afood industry 3afood quality 3afood safety 3ananoparticles 3apeople 0aFe3O4 nanoparticles 0aNanotechnology 0aAnalytical methods1 aHuang, Xingyi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0157-86591 aWang, Chengquan1 aTian, Xiaoyu1 aChang, Xianhui1 aRen, Yi1 aYu, Shanshan0 tFood chemistry.g2021 Apr. 16, v. 342 p.128343-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2020.1283433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03289naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001700156245012700173300001800300520180100318592002802119650001902147650001602166650002602182650001502208650002102223650000902244650001302253650001102266650001402277650001702291650001702308650001302325650001902338650001602357650001602373650002102389650001402410700001702424700001302441700001702454700001502471700001702486700001802503700001602521700001902537700001602556773008802572856009002660852000902750655001202759IND60090536420221120032422.0141102e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009053642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.05.0432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Limin10aSelective metabolic effects of gold nanorods on normal and cancer cells and their application in anticancer drug screening  ap. 7117-7126.  aCetyltrimethylammonim bromide coated gold nanorods (Au NRs) has a potential to become anti-cancer nano-drugs. Previously, the comparative responses of human alveolar adenocarcinoma epithelial cells (A549) and normal bronchial epithelial cells (16HBE) exposed to Au NRs have been characterized. It has been shown that Au NRs are translocated from the lysosome to the mitochondria in A549 cells but not in normal 16HBE cell lines. However, the molecular information during this cellular translocation remains largely undetermined. Here, we have used a metabonomic technique to comparatively analyze the time-dependent metabolic changes in Au NRs-induced A549 and 16HBE. We found that Au NRs exposure caused a disruption in the intracellular environment of both A549 and 16HBE cells, which metabolically manifested in the reduction of lactate levels in both cell lines. In addition, Au NRs induced oxidative stress in both cells lines. However, the 16HBE cells are more able to offset the oxidative stress than the A549 cells; this is because de novo GSH synthesis is triggered in Au NRs treated 16HBE cells but not in A549 cells, and the conversion of GSH to GSSG is more profound in 16HBE cells compared to A549 cells. The severe oxidative stress induces damage to mitochondria in A549 cells, leading to cell death, which is evident in the marked reduction in the levels of nucleosides and nucleotides. Furthermore, significantly elevated levels of amino acids are likely due to stress hormones being produced in Au NRs treated cells. These findings provide comprehensive molecular information on the distinctive intracellular localization, cellular uptake and translocation of Au NRs in normal and tumor cells, highlighting the value of metabonomics in assessing biological effects of nano-drugs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadenocarcinoma 3aamino acids 3aantineoplastic agents 3acell death 3aepithelial cells 3agold 3ahormones 3ahumans 3alysosomes 3ametabolomics 3amitochondria 3ananorods 3aneoplasm cells 3anucleosides 3anucleotides 3aoxidative stress 3ascreening1 aWang, Liming1 aHu, Yili1 aLiu, Zhigang1 aTian, Yuan1 aWu, Xiaochun1 aZhao, Yuliang1 aTang, Huiru1 aChen, Chunying1 aWang, Yulan0 tBiomaterials.g2013 Sept., v. 34, no. 29 p.7117-7126dElsevier Ltdx0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.05.0433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02509naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001800143245017000161520132500331592002801656650001601684650001101700650001601711650001201727650001101739650001401750650001001764650001601774650001901790650000801809650001101817650001101828650002201839650001701861650001101878700001701889773011901906856007702025852000902102655001202111IND60703749520221121043733.0200721e20200623xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070374952DNAL7 a10.3390/plants90607862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTada, Yuichi 10aComparative Functional Analysis of Class II Potassium Transporters, SvHKT2;1, SvHKT2;2, and HvHKT2;1, on Ionic Transport and Salt Tolerance in Transgenic Arabidopsis  aClass II high-affinity potassium transporters (HKT2s) mediate Na⁺–K⁺ cotransport and Na⁺/K⁺ homeostasis under K⁺-starved or saline conditions. Their functions have been studied in yeast and X. laevis oocytes; however, little is known about their respective properties in plant cells. In this study, we characterized the Na⁺ and K⁺ transport properties of SvHKT2;1, SvHKT2;2 and HvHKT2;1 in Arabidopsis under different ionic conditions. The differences were detected in shoot K⁺ accumulation and root K⁺ uptake under salt stress conditions, K⁺ accumulation in roots and phloem sap under K⁺-starved conditions, and shoot and root Na⁺ accumulation under K⁺-starved conditions among the HKT2s transgenic lines and WT plants. These results indicate the diverse ionic transport properties of these HKT2s in plant cells, which could not be detected using yeast or X. laevis oocytes. Furthermore, Arabidopsis expressing HKT2s showed reduced salt tolerance, while over-expression of HvHKT2;1 in barley, which has the ability to sequestrate Na⁺, showed enhanced salt tolerance by accumulating Na⁺ in the shoots. These results suggest that the coordinated enhancement of Na⁺ accumulation and sequestration mechanisms in shoots could be a promising strategy to confer salt tolerance to glycophytes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3abarley 3ahomeostasis 3aoocytes 3aphloem 3apotassium 3aroots 3asalt stress 3asalt tolerance 3asap 3ashoots 3asodium 3atransgenic plants 3atransporters 3ayeasts1 aOhnuma, Aki 0 tPlants.g2020 June 23, v. 9, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21620x2223-77477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants90607863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03275naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001800143245014300161520182300304592002802127650001002155650001602165650000902181650002302190650001202213650001002225650001102235650001402246650001502260650000902275650001202284650001802296650001502314650001302329650001702342650001202359650000902371700002202380700002102402700002102423700002402444700002102468700002202489700002802511700002402539773011902563856007802682852000902760655001202769IND60763429220221123040433.0220120e20220106xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076342922DNAL7 a10.3390/foods110201412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWood, Erin L.10aWhey-Adapted versus Natural Cow’s Milk Formulation: Distinctive Feeding Responses and Post-Ingestive c-Fos Expression in Laboratory Mice  aThe natural 20:80 whey:casein ratio in cow’s milk (CM) for adults and infants is adjusted to reflect the 60:40 ratio of human milk, but the feeding and metabolic consequences of this adjustment have been understudied. In adult human subjects, the 60:40 CM differently affects glucose metabolism and hormone release than the 20:80 CM. In laboratory animals, whey-adapted goat’s milk is consumed in larger quantities. It is unknown whether whey enhancement of CM would have similar consequences on appetite and whether it would affect feeding-relevant brain regulatory mechanisms. In this set of studies utilizing laboratory mice, we found that the 60:40 CM was consumed more avidly than the 20:80 control formulation by animals motivated to eat by energy deprivation and by palatability (in the absence of hunger) and that this hyperphagia stemmed from prolongation of the meal. Furthermore, in two-bottle choice paradigms, whey-adapted CM was preferred against the natural 20:80 milk. The intake of the whey-adapted CM induced neuronal activation (assessed through analysis of c-Fos expression in neurons) in brain sites promoting satiation, but importantly, this activation was less pronounced than after ingestion of the natural 20:80 whey:casein CM. Activation of hypothalamic neurons synthesizing anorexigenic neuropeptide oxytocin (OT) was also less robust after the 60:40 CM intake than after the 20:80 CM. Pharmacological blockade of the OT receptor in mice led to an increase in the consumption only of the 20:80 CM, thus, of the milk that induced greater activation of OT neurons. We conclude that the whey-adapted CM is overconsumed compared to the natural 20:80 CM and that this overconsumption is associated with weakened responsiveness of central networks involved in satiety signalling, including OT.  aPublisher supplied data 3abrain 3abreast milk 3acows 3aenergy deprivation 3aglucose 3agoats 3ahunger 3aingestion 3ametabolism 3amilk 3aneurons 3aneuropeptides 3aovereating 3aoxytocin 3apalatability 3asatiety 3awhey1 aGartner, Sarah N.1 aKlockars, Anica 1 aMcColl, Laura K.1 aChristian, David G.1 aJervis, Robin E.1 aProsser, Colin G.1 aCarpenter, Elizabeth A.1 aOlszewski, Pawel K.0 tFoods.g2022 Jan. 06, v. 11, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods110201413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02742naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100003000145245007800175300001800253500001400271500002000285520103600305592002801341596005701369596005201426596010401478596005301582596000901635596005301644650001101697650001501708650002201723650001601745650002001761650001501781650001301796650001601809650001301825650001201838650001201850650001301862650001401875650001401889650002201903650001201925700001501937700001801952700001601970773012601986856007902112852000902191655001202200IND60722307720221116185357.0210101e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072230772DNAL7 a10.1111/1755-0998.120052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRobledo‐Arnuncio, J.

The program provides joint estimates of maternal, paternal and cross‐parental correlations within and among a set of predefined groups of seeds or seedlings, as well as derivative estimates of effective parental numbers. PSA utilizes data sets that distinguish between maternal and paternal contributions to the genotype of each offspring in the sample, but does not require parental samples per se. The approach requires assay of codominant diploid markers from both seed coat (maternally inherited) and seedling/embryo (biparentally inherited) tissues for each offspring. A simulation analysis of PSA's performance shows that it provides fairly accurate parental correlation estimates from affordable sampling effort. PSA should be of interest to plant biologists studying the interplay between dispersal, demography and genetics, as well as plant–animal interactions.  aPublisher supplied data  aCGL2009‐09428cRamón y Cajal research fellowships  cSpanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness  aNJAES/USDA‐17111cNew Jersey Agricultural Experiment Station and the US Department of Agriculture  aNSF‐DEB‐0514956cNational Science Foundation  cUCLA  aNSF‐DEB‐0516529cNational Science Foundation 3aassays 3abiologists 3acomputer software 3acorrelation 3adata collection 3ademography 3adiploidy 3aexhibitions 3agenotype 3aparents 3aprogeny 3asampling 3aseed coat 3aseedlings 3asimulation models 3atissues1 aGrivet, D.1 aSmouse, P.

DESIGN: Prospective observational clinical study. SETTING: University teaching hospital. ANIMALS: Eighteen horses undergoing exploratory celiotomy for colic. Inclusion criteria for the study included survival and anesthetic recovery from exploratory celiotomy, no history of surgery within the past year. INTERVENTIONS: Blood was obtained via jugular venipuncture before surgery (time 0) and at 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours after recovery from anesthesia. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Quantitative and semiquantitative fibrinogen, SAA, total nucleated cell counts, and total protein were evaluated at each time point. Multivariable linear regression was used to assess differences at each time point and after grouping horses according to duration of colic prior to surgery, strangulating surgical lesion or not, presence of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) on admission, and postsurgical complications. Significant (P < 0.05) increases in SAA concentrations occurred in all cases after surgery compared to fibrinogen concentration, which only demonstrated a mild, clinically insignificant increase postsurgery. SAA concentrations were also significantly increased (P < 0.05) in cases identified with SIRS prior to surgery and postoperatively at 48 (P = 0.05) and 72 hours (P = 0.02) in horses that developed complications. CONCLUSIONS: Measurement of SAA is a more sensitive indicator of inflammation than fibrinogen in the perioperative period of horses requiring exploratory celiotomy for colic. Serial measurement of SAA at 48, 72, and 96 hours after surgery may be helpful to determine risk of complications and guide postoperative management. Measurement of SAA on admission also allows for quantification of SIRS when it is detected clinically.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamyloid 3aanesthesia 3aanesthetics 3ablood serum 3acolic 3afibrinogen 3ahorses 3ainflammation 3alinear models 3aprotein content 3arisk 3asurgery1 aLeise, Britta S.1 aBurgess, Brandy A.1 aMorley, Paul S.1 aCloninger, Madison1 aHassel, Diana M.0 tJournal of veterinary emergency and critical care.g2016 May, v. 26, no. 3 p.344-351dVeterinary Emergency & Critical Care Societyx1479-32617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/vec.123653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03214naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245013400171520182300305592002802128650002202156650001502178650001102193650002102204650002302225650001502248650001402263650001202277650000902289650001402298650001902312650001602331653002302347653001902370653002402389653002702413653000902440700006702449700001802516700001502534700001802549773009402567856008602661852000902747655001202756IND60754711720221117232017.0211106e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075471172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e082082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRossita, Annuri10aAssessing the monetary value of ecosystem services provided by Gaung – Batang Tuaka Peat Hydrological Unit (KHG), Riau Province  aPeatland plays a pivotal role in providing natural resource production and environmental services for human welfare. However, many studies have mentioned the impact of dryland cultivation in peatland on the shifting carbon balance in the ecosystem that clearly will alter the interaction of these two ecosystem services. The goal of this study, conducted under the framework of the System of Environmental-Economic Accounting (SEEA) was to monetary value the ecosystem services (ES) of provisioning and carbon regulating services of the Gaung-Batang Tuaka Peat Hydrological Unit (KHG). We focused on KHG in response to Regulation No.57/2016, which highlights ecosystem boundary as a new basis for peatland management. Under the SEEA framework, ecosystem services become a benefit when utilized by ecosystem beneficiaries. In this case, provisioning services will be valued only for cultivated land, while carbon services calculated for the entire study area (global beneficiaries). Our study showed that the provisioning services and carbon services are under the trade-off condition, where the monetary value of provisioning services increased at a slower rate (0.50 million USD annually) than the monetary loss of the benefit of carbon services (5.28 million USD annually), greatly exceeded the monetary value of provisioning services. We highlight two main strategies to increase the monetary value of the KHG towards a synergy condition, namely increased value-added by reducing the productivity gap among ES beneficiaries and large-scale adoption of a profitable cultivation system with minimum peat disturbance. The main enablers required include financing access and incentives (e.g., reduce tax) and disincentives to allow for peat-adaptive commodities to compete with dryland commodities in the future market.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3aarid lands 3acarbon 3aecological value 3aeconomic valuation 3aecosystems 3ahydrology 3amarkets 3apeat 3apeatlands 3asocial welfare 3avalue added 0aEcosystem services 0aMonetary value 0aPeatland management 0aPeat hydrological unit 0aRiau1 aNurrochmat, Dodik Ridho1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4876-86121 aBoer, Rizaldi1 aHein, Lars1 aRiqqi, Akhmad0 tHeliyon.g2021 Oct., v. 7, no. 10 p.e08208-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e082083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02890naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002600143245012100169520145800290592002801748650001201776650001101788650001501799650002201814650001301836650001401849650001101863650004301874650001901917650001301936650001601949650001901965650002501984650001102009650001502020700002402035700001902059700002002078700001902098700001902117700002302136700002302159700002102182773011902203856007702322852000902399655001202408IND60703749720221120212433.0200721e20200623xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070374972DNAL7 a10.3390/plants90607872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSilva-Díaz, Cecilia,10aRadiation Interception, Conversion and Partitioning Efficiency in Potato Landraces: How Far Are We from the Optimum?  aCrop efficiencies associated with intercepted radiation, conversion into biomass and allocation to edible organs are essential for yield improvement strategies that would enhance genetic properties to maximize carbon gain without increasing crop inputs. The production of 20 potato landraces—never studied before—was analyzed for radiation interception (i), conversion (c) and partitioning (p) efficiencies. Additionally, other physiological traits related to senescence delay (normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) s l p), tuberization precocity (t u), photosynthetic performance and dry tuber yield per plant (TY) were also assessed. Vegetation reflectance was remotely acquired and the efficiencies estimated through a process-based model parameterized by a time-series of airborne imageries. The combination of i and c , closely associated with an early tuber maturity and a NDVI s l p explained 39% of the variability grouping the most productive genotypes. TY was closely correlated to senescence delay (r P e a r s o n = 0.74), indicating the usefulness of remote sensing methods for potato yield diversity characterization. About 89% of TY was explained by the first three principal components, associated mainly to t u , c and i , respectively. When comparing potato with other major crops, its p is very close to the theoretical maximum. These findings suggest that there is room for improving i and c to enhance potato production.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3acarbon 3acrop yield 3aearly development 3agenotype 3alandraces 3amodels 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3aphotosynthesis 3apotatoes 3areflectance 3aremote sensing 3atime series analysis 3atubers 3avegetation1 aRamírez, David  A.1 aRinza, Javier 1 aNinanya, Johan 1 aLoayza, Hildo 1 aGómez, René,1 aAnglin, Noelle  L.1 aEyzaguirre, Raúl 1 aQuiroz, Roberto 0 tPlants.g2020 June 23, v. 9, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21620x2223-77477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants90607873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03206naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245015400172500001900326520158800345592002801933650001501961650001501976650001601991650003102007650001802038650001702056650001802073650001902091650000902110650001302119650001302132650002402145650001102169650001702180650001802197650001602215653000902231653002202240653001602262653002302278653003002301700001802331700002202349700002002371700003202391700002002423700001902443773010602462856008702568852000902655655001202664IND60735745820221119064157.0210527e20210805xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073574582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2021.1266932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSarolia, Jayant10aMobility of doxorubicin in TPGS micelles in response to sodium taurodeoxycholate incorporation: Analyses based on scattering and fluorescence studies  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis study describes the effect of bile salt addition upon encapsulation locus of doxorubicin (DOX, a hydrophilic anticancer drug) in D-α-tocopherol polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate (TPGS) micelles. Sodium taurodeoxycholate (NaTDC) was used as bile salt. After analyzing the scattering behavior of TPGS-NaTDC mixed system, steady-state fluorescence, time-resolved fluorescence and fluorescence anisotropy techniques were employed to track the movement of DOX in micelles at various NaTDC concentrations. Our results suggest that after triggering contraction of micelles in low concentration regime (0.05–0.5 mM), NaTDC molecules participated with TPGS to form mixed micelles (average hydrodynamic diameter: 8–11 nm) and swollen aggregates (200–300 nm). In spite this, no changes in the shape of micelles and optical properties of solution were recorded. Small angle neutron scattering data suggest that NaTDC molecules engaged with core-forming segment of TPGS at low concentration (0.05–1.0 mM), and later migrated towards the shell region and imparted electrostatic charge to the headgroups. Transitions beyond this point (>1.0 mM) were marked by drastic changes in the effective charge of aggregates and aggregation number of participating molecules. We have shown that NaTDC-derived electrostatic charge can be exploited to drive positively charged DOX molecules from the hydrophilic shell to apolar core region in TPGS micelles. Importantly, loaded DOX molecules remained stable against storage time (up to 50 days) and microenvironment temperature (25–40°C).  aPublisher supplied data 3aanisotropy 3abile salts 3adoxorubicin 3aelectrostatic interactions 3aencapsulation 3afluorescence 3ahydrodynamics 3ahydrophilicity 3aloci 3amicelles 3aneutrons 3apolyethylene glycol 3asodium 3astorage time 3asuccinic acid 3atemperature 0aTPGS 0aNonionic micelles 0aAggregation 0aFluorescence decay 0aElectrostatic interaction1 aShukla, Rahul1 aRāẏa, Debeśa,1 aAswal, Vinod K.1 aChoudhury, Sharmistha Dutta1 aBahadur, Pratap1 aTiwari, Sanjay0 tColloids and surfaces.g2021 Aug. 05, v. 622 p.126693-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2021.1266933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01537naa a2200253 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002100152245005000173300001600223520078600239592002801025650001301053650002001066650001101086650001501097773009501112856005501207852000901262655001201271IND4501494720221121210848.0150416e200109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND450149472DNAL7 a10.1111/j.0006-341X.2001.00892.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHellmich, Martin10aMonitoring Clinical Trials with Multiple Arms  ap. 892-898.  aIn order to benefit from the substantial overhead expenses of a large group sequential clinical trial, the simultaneous investigation of several competing treatments becomes more popular. If at some interim analysis any treatment arm reveals itself to be inferior to any other treatment under investigation, this inferior arm may be or may even need to be dropped for ethical and/or economic reasons. Recently proposed methods for monitoring and analysis of group sequential clinical trials with multiple treatment arms are compared and discussed. The main focus of the article is on the application and extension of (adaptive) closed testing procedures in the group sequential setting that strongly control the familywise error rate. A numerical example is given for illustration.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiometry 3aclinical trials 3aethics 3amonitoring0 tBiometrics.g2001 Sept., v. 57, no. 3 p.892-898dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0006-341X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.0006-341X.2001.00892.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02528naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001400152245010700166300001600273520129400289592002801583650002501611650001101636650002101647650001001668650001101678650001001689650002301699650001001722650001201732650001601744653001401760653002301774653002401797653002101821700001601842700001501858700001501873700001401888773009501902856008801997852000902085655001202094IND60479785220221119091136.0160123e20110101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047978522DNAL7 a10.1556/AAlim.40.2011.Suppl.192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSipos, L.10aRole of sight in flavour perception: Sensory assessment of apple varieties by sighted and blind panels  ap. 198-213.  aThe present study investigated how sighted and blind sensory assessors evaluated the quality of various apple varieties: Regal Prince (Gala Must), Jonagold Schneica (Jonica), Watson Jonathan, Golden Reinders and Generos. A total of 80 sighted and 12 blind people participated in the study, in three groups (sighted people without blindfolds, sighted people with blindfolds, blind people). The preference of sensory attributes (size, shape, colour, texture, taste and odour) was evaluated on a six-category scale. The data were analysed using single-factor (ANOVA, LSD<sub>95%, 99%</sub>) and multi-factor (Cluster analysis, ANOVA, LSD<sub>95%, 99%</sub>) evaluation. The results showed that blind and sighted assessors made similar judgements on external attributes perceptible by touch (size, shape), but differed in their evaluation of certain quality factors (flavour, taste), resulting in opponent patterns of preference on some apple varieties (Generos, Jonagold Schneica). A further conclusion of the experiment is that there was less deviation between the judgements of sighted assessors when they saw the apples than when they were blindfolded. The background of this phenomenon might be explained by the uncertainty and disturbed perception, which lead to inconsistent judgements.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalysis of variance 3aapples 3acluster analysis 3acolor 3aflavor 3aodors 3asensory evaluation 3ataste 3atexture 3auncertainty 0ablindness 0aflavour perception 0aconsumer preference 0acluster analysis1 aKirály, I.1 aBábel, L.1 aKókai, Z.1 aTóth, M.0 tActa alimentaria.g2011 Jan. 1, v. 40, no. 0 p.198-213dAkadémiai Kiadóx0139-30067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1556%2FAAlim.40.2011.Suppl.193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02354naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001800156245015200174300001800326520107400344592002801418650001001446650001301456650001801469650001301487650002101500650002601521650001701547650000901564650001801573650001301591700001701604700001801621700001301639700001501652700001401667700001701681700001901698700001601717773008801733856009001821852000901911655001201920IND60090537020221120052731.0141102e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009053702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.05.0812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yinsong10apH-sensitive pullulan-based nanoparticle carrier of methotrexate and combretastatin A4 for the combination therapy against hepatocellular carcinoma  ap. 7181-7190.  aThis study designs a pH-sensitive nanoparticle carrier of methotrexate (MTX) and combretastatin A4 (CA4) based on pullulan for the combination therapy against hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Briefly, N-urocanyl pullulan (URPA) with the degree of substitution (DS) of 5.2% was synthesized and then conjugated with MTX to form MTX-URPA, in which MTX content was 17.8%. MTX-URPA nanoparticles prepared by the dialysis method had spherical shape and the mean size of 187.1 nm, and showed high affinity for HepG2 cells. CA4 was successfully loaded into MTX-URPA nanoparticles and exhibited pH-sensitive in vitro release property. After intravenous injection to PLC/PRF/5-bearing nude mice, CA4 loaded MTX-URPA (CA4/MTX-URPA) nanoparticles achieved the enhanced antitumor and anti-angiogenic effects, the prolonged circulation time in blood, and the increased distributions both in the liver and the tumor. In conclusion, this drug carrier system has significant liver-targeting property and exhibits advantages for the combination therapy against hepatocellular carcinoma.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood 3adialysis 3adrug carriers 3ahepatoma 3ahuman cell lines 3aintravenous injection 3amethotrexate 3amice 3ananoparticles 3apullulan1 aChen, Hongli1 aLiu, Yuanyuan1 aWu, Jing1 aZhou, Ping1 aWang, Yan1 aLi, Rongshan1 aYang, Xiaoying1 aZhang, Ning0 tBiomaterials.g2013 Sept., v. 34, no. 29 p.7181-7190dElsevier Ltdx0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.05.0813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02613naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003000147245013100177300001800308520139100326592002801717650002301745650002101768650002601789650002601815650001601841650001401857650001201871650001001883650000901893650001401902700001901916700001801935700001901953700002101972700002001993773011202013856008102125852000902206655001202215IND60440356620221119033815.0151024e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044035662DNAL7 a10.1007/s12010-015-1647-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPayoungkiattikun, Wisarut10aIn Silico Identification for α-Amino-ε-Caprolactam Racemases by Using Information on the Structure and Function Relationship  ap. 1303-1314.  aIn silico identification for enzymes having desired functions is attractive because there is a possibility that numerous desirable enzymes have been deposited in databases. In this study, α-amino-ε-caprolactam (ACL) racemases were searched from the NCBI protein database. Four hundred thirteen fold-type I pyridoxal 5′-phosphate-dependent enzymes which are considered to contain sequences of ACL racemase were firstly obtained by submitting the sequence of ACL racemase from Achromobacter obae to the database. By identifying Lys241 as a key amino acid residue, 13 candidates for ACL racemase were selected. Then, putative ACL racemase genes were synthesized as codon-optimized sequences for expression in Escherichia coli. They were subcloned and expressed in E. coli BL21 and underwent His-tag purification. ACL and amino acid amide racemizing activities were detected among ten of the candidates. The locus tags Oant_4493, Smed_5339, and CSE45_2055 derived from Ochrobactrum anthropi ATCC49188, Sinorhizobium medicae WSM 419, and Citreicella sp. SE45, respectively, showed higher racemization activity against D- and L-ACLs rather than that of ACL racemase from A. obae. Our results demonstrate that the newly discovered ACL racemases were unique from ACL racemase from A. obae and might be useful for applications in dynamic kinetic resolution for D- or L-amino acid production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAchromobacter obae 3aEscherichia coli 3aOchrobactrum anthropi 3aSinorhizobium medicae 3aamino acids 3adatabases 3aenzymes 3agenes 3aloci 3apyridoxal1 aOkazaki, Seiji1 aNakano, Shogo1 aIna, Atsutoshi1 aH-Kittikun, Aran1 aAsano, Yasuhisa0 tApplied biochemistry and biotechnology.g2015 July, v. 176, no. 5 p.1303-1314dSpringer USx0273-22897nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12010-015-1647-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02509naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002700147245012300174520111500297592002801412650002401440650001601464650002501480650002601505650001901531650001401550650002301564650001401587650000901601650002301610653002401633653002301657653001701680653001401697653000801711653000801719653000701727653000701734653000701741653000701748653000801755700002201763700003001785773012201815856008101937852000902018655001202027IND60679330820221117213931.0200121e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067933082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2019.1089462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSolomando, Juan Carlos10aStudy on fish oil microcapsules as neat and added to meat model systems: Enrichment and bioaccesibility of EPA and DHA  aThis study is mainly focused on evaluating the bioaccesibility of eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acids (DHA) in different types of fish oil microcapsules, as a neat and delivered in different meat model systems. For that, lecithin-maltodextrine (MO) and lecithin + chitosan-maltodextrine (MU) microcapsules of fish oil were produced and added to two meat model systems: cooked (CK) and dry-cured (DC). The content of EPA and DHA was similar in MO and MU, but in meat model systems the highest quantity of these fatty acids was found in DC-MU, followed by DC-MO, CK-MU and CK-MO. The highest percentage of EPA and DHA released during the in vitro digestion was found in CK-MO, followed by CK-MU, MU and MO, and DC-MU and DC-MO. Thus, the characterisctics of the microcapsules and the meat model systems influence on both the enrichment and the bioaccesibility of EPA and DHA, but not in the same trend. This could point out the importance of analysing not only the quantity of EPA and DHA in the enriched food but also the bioaccesibility of these bioactive compounds in most products as possible.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioactive compounds 3acured meats 3adocosahexaenoic acid 3aeicosapentaenoic acid 3aenriched foods 3afish oils 3ain vitro digestion 3alecithins 3ameat 3amodel food systems 0aOmega-3 fatty acids 0aFish oil emulsions 0aSpray-drying 0aω-3 PUFA 0aEPA 0aDHA 0aMO 0aMU 0aCK 0aDC 0aCON1 aAntequera, Teresa1 aPérez-Palacios, Trinidad0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2020 Feb., v. 120 p.108946-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2019.1089463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02736naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245010100163300001600264520161800280592002801898650001001926650001101936650001501947650001401962650001401976650003101990650001102021650001302032650001702045650001202062650002202074700001602096700001602112773015202128856007302280852000902353655001202362IND60519954420221119015352.0160511e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051995442DNAL7 a10.1111/vec.124652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalcedo, Mallory C.12aA systematic review of human and veterinary applications of noninvasive tissue oxygen monitoring  ap. 323-332.  aOBJECTIVE: To describe the methodology for and utilization of tissue oxygen monitoring by near infrared spectroscopy, and to review the current literature on the use of this monitoring modality in human and veterinary settings. DATA SOURCES: Scientific reviews and original research found using the PubMed and CAB Abstract search engines with the following keywords: “tissue oxygen monitoring,” “near‐infrared tissue spectroscopy,” and “tissue oxygen saturation (StO₂).” HUMAN DATA SYNTHESIS: Tissue oxygen monitors have been evaluated in a wide variety of human clinical applications including trauma and triage, surgery, sepsis, and septic shock, and early goal‐directed therapy. StO₂ more rapidly identifies occult shock in human patients compared to traditional methods, which can lead to earlier intervention in these patients. VETERINARY DATA SYNTHESIS: Veterinary studies involving tissue oxygen monitoring are limited, but the technology may have utility for identification of hemorrhagic shock earlier than changes in base excess, blood lactate concentration, or other traditional perfusion parameters. CONCLUSION: Tissue oxygen monitoring is most commonly performed utilizing a noninvasive, portable monitor, which provides real‐time, continuous, repeatable StO₂ measurements. A decline in StO₂ is an early indicator of shock in both human and veterinary patients. Low StO₂ values in human patients are associated with increased morbidity, mortality, and length of hospitalization, as well as the development of multiple organ system dysfunction and surgical site infections.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood 3ahumans 3amonitoring 3amorbidity 3amortality 3anear-infrared spectroscopy 3aoxygen 3apatients 3aseptic shock 3asurgery 3asystematic review1 aTart, Kelly1 aHall, Kelly0 tJournal of veterinary emergency and critical care.g2016 May, v. 26, no. 3 p.323-332dVeterinary Emergency & Critical Care Societyx1479-32617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/vec.124653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02672naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005500152245014600207520134900353592002801702650001501730650001601745650002001761650001501781650002501796650001501821650001301836650001401849653001901863653002501882653001501907653002601922653002701948700001801975700001701993700002502010700002402035773010702059856008702166852000902253655001202262IND60735746420221119064313.0211123e20210920xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073574642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2021.1267002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKania, Dina1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9488-285410aRheological investigation of synthetic-based drilling fluid containing non-ionic surfactant pentaerythritol ester using full factorial design  aNon-ionic surfactant pentaerythritol ester (PE ester) can be used as a lubricant and chemical thinner in flocculated synthetic-based mud (SBM). However, its adsorption on surfaces and at oil-water interfaces may interfere with anionic secondary emulsifier and organoclay additives in the mud. The interactions between these additives may significantly affect the viscosity of SBM emulsions. Therefore, in this study, we systematically developed SBM formulations containing a non-ionic surfactant PE ester and evaluated the interactions between the surfactant, secondary emulsifier, and organoclay that influence the rheology of SBM using a full factorial design. Three rheological properties were chosen as responses: plastic viscosity (PV) and yield point (YP), and YP/PV ratio. Factorial analysis of the interaction between the secondary emulsifier and PE ester showed that the interactions caused significant effects on PV, YP, and YP/PV ratio. These multiple responses were optimized using the desirability function, and the optimum formulation was at concentrations of 1.0 lb/bbl, 6.2 lb/bbl, and 1.0% for secondary emulsifier, organoclay, and PE ester, respectively. A quantitative relationship between the various factors and responses was established, allowing a prediction of desirable rheological properties for drilling operations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aemulsifiers 3afactor analysis 3alubricants 3anonionic surfactants 3aprediction 3arheology 3aviscosity 0aDrilling fluid 0aNon-ionic surfactant 0aOrganoclay 0aFull factorial design 0aRheological properties1 aYunus, Robiah1 aOmar, Rozita1 aAbdul Rashid, Suraya1 aMohamed Jan, Badrul0 tColloids and surfaces.g2021 Sept. 20, v. 625 p.126700-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2021.1267003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04367naa a2200769 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003700150245008700187520220700274592002802481650001902509650001902528650001602547650001502563650002102578650001902599650002102618650002602639650001202665650001702677650001202694650002802706650001502734650002602749650001802775650001502793650001702808650001402825650001302839650001302852650002002865650001702885650001202902650001702914650001002931650001602941650001102957653001702968653001702985653001803002653000903020653001603029653001703045653000703062653000903069653000803078653000803086653000803094653000803102653001003110653000803120700002003128700007303148700001603221700001403237700006103251700001903312700005603331773010403387856008503491852000903576655001203585IND60765913220221116225239.0220606e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076591322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2022.1128072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPalansooriya, Kumuduni Niroshika10aBiochar alters chemical and microbial properties of microplastic-contaminated soil  aThe occurrence of microplastics (MPs) in soils can negatively affect soil biodiversity and function. Soil amendments applied to MP-contaminated soil can alter the overall soil properties and enhance its functions and processes. However, little is known about how soil amendments improve the quality of MP-contaminated soils. Thus, the present study used a microcosm experiment to explore the potential effects of four types of biochar on the chemical and microbial properties of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) MP-contaminated soil under both drought and well-watered conditions. The results show that the biochars altered soil pH, electrical conductivity (EC), available phosphorous, and total exchangeable cations (TEC) with some variability depending on the biochar type. Oilseed rape straw (OSR)-derived biochars increased soil pH, EC, and TEC under both water conditions with the highest values of 7.94, 0.54 dS m⁻¹ and 22.0 cmol₍₊₎ kg⁻¹, respectively. Soil enzyme activities varied under all treatments; in particular, under drought conditions, the fluorescein diacetate activity increased in soils with high temperature (700 °C) biochar. The application of soft wood pellet biochar (700 °C) to MP-contaminated soil increased urease activity by 146% under well-watered conditions. OSR-derived biochars significantly reduced soil acid phosphatase activity under both water conditions. With biochar supplementation, the diversity indices of the bacterial community increased in well-watered soil but not in soil under drought conditions. The abundance of bacterial phyla, such as Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Dictyoglomi, and Gemmatimonadetes, was relatively high in all treatments. Biochar application resulted in negligible variations in bacterial communities under drought conditions but significant variations under well-watered conditions. The findings of this study imply that biochar can be used as a soil amendment to improve the overall soil quality of MP-contaminated soil, but its impact varies depending on the pyrolysis feedstock and temperature. Thus, selecting a suitable biochar is important for improving the soil quality in MP-contaminated soils.  aPublisher supplied data 3aActinobacteria 3aBrassica napus 3aDictyoglomi 3aFirmicutes 3aGemmatimonadetes 3aProteobacteria 3aacid phosphatase 3abacterial communities 3abiochar 3abiodiversity 3adrought 3aelectrical conductivity 3afeedstocks 3afluorescein diacetate 3amicroplastics 3aphosphorus 3apolyethylene 3apyrolysis 3aresearch 3asoftwood 3asoil amendments 3asoil enzymes 3asoil pH 3asoil quality 3astraw 3atemperature 3aurease 0aMicroplastic 0aNano-plastic 0aPlastic mulch 0aLDPE 0aSoil enzyme 0aSoil quality 0aMP 0aLDPE 0aOSR 0aSWP 0aHTT 0aFDA 0aANOVA 0aLSD1 aSang, Mee Kyung1 aIgalavithana, Avanthi Deshani1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5322-85841 aZhang, Ming1 aHou, Deyi1 aOleszczuk, Patryk1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8546-72991 aSung, Jwakyung1 aOk, Yong Sik1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3401-09120 tEnvironmental research.g2022 June, v. 209 p.112807-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12442x0013-93517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2022.1128073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02608naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245012500175520149700300592002801797650002001825650001101845650002001856650002401876650002801900653002801928653002701956653002901983653002202012700005902034773009402093856008602187852000902273655001202282IND60754712520221117231956.0211106e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075471252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e082162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChotirat, Saranlita10aPart-of-Speech tagging enhancement to natural language processing for Thai wh-question classification with deep learning  aQuestion classification is a crucial task for answer selection. Question classification could help define the structure of question sentences generated by features extraction from a sentence, such as who, when, where, and how. In this paper, we proposed a methodology to improve question classification from texts by using feature selection and word embedding techniques. We conducted several experiments to evaluate the performance of the proposed methodology using two different datasets (TREC-6 dataset and Thai sentence dataset) with term frequency and combined term frequency-inverse document frequency including Unigram, Unigram+Bigram, and Unigram + Trigram as features. Machine learning models based on traditional and deep learning classifiers were used. The traditional classification models were Multinomial Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine. The deep learning techniques were Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Hybrid model, which combined CNN and BiLSTM model. The experiment results showed that our methodology based on Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging was the best to improve question classification accuracy. The classifying question categories achieved with average micro F1-score of 0.98 when applied SVM model on adding all POS tags in the TREC-6 dataset. The highest average micro F1-score achieved 0.8 when applied GloVe by using CNN model on adding focusing tags in the Thai sentences dataset.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3agloves 3aneural networks 3aregression analysis 3asupport vector machines 0aQuestion classification 0aThai sentence analysis 0aPart-of-Speech (POS) tag 0aFeature selection1 aMeesad, Phayung1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3742-64570 tHeliyon.g2021 Oct., v. 7, no. 10 p.e08216-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e082163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03096naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004100111040001800152100001500170245013400185300001800319520140600337592002801743650002001771650002101791650001101812650001301823650002101836650001501857650001501872650002401887650001201911650001101923650002101934650001801955650001501973650001601988650003802004650002102042650002402063650002302087650002302110650002502133650002202158650001202180650001702192650002002209650004102229650001802270651001602288700001802304773011202322856008702434852000902521655001202530IND4466793120221120185709.0141112e20111115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446679312DNAL7 a219629282pmid7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2011.08.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOehler, F.10aPredicting stream N and P concentrations from loads and catchment characteristics at regional scale: A concentration ratio method  ap. 5392-5402.  aWe used a concentration ratio method to predict yearly and summer averages of stream total nitrogen, nitrate and total phosphorus concentrations at a regional scale. The ratio of the median daily concentration on the flow weighted annual concentration was used. This ratio characterizes the concentration dynamics of a catchment. We took advantage of the commonly used budget type models applied at a regional scale to relate concentrations to loads instead of directly to land uses, as has previously been done. The relationship was modeled with Boosted Regression Trees using catchment and stream characteristics along with loads and flows obtained from the SPARROW budget model. The ratio modeling approach was compared to a direct approach for concentration prediction, and also to a simple method where the mean ratio was used. The modeling performances of the ratio models were overall satisfying (r² of 49% to 78%), and a better choice than the two other methods tested. This ratio modeling approach is based on a steady state assumption and largely ignores temporal dynamics. As such, this modeling technique does not replace the more physically-based techniques, but allows for hybrid approaches for improved spatial interpolations. This method could be used to predict effectively the impact (at equilibrium) of land use change and management scenarios on water quality at a regional scale.  aPublisher supplied data 3aland use change 3amodel validation 3amodels 3anitrates 3anitrogen content 3aphosphorus 3aprediction 3aregression analysis 3astreams 3asummer 3awater management 3awater quality 3awatersheds 2aEnvironment 2aEnvironmental Monitoringxmethods 2aModels, Chemical 2aModels, Theoretical 2aNitratesxanalysis 2aNitrogenxanalysis 2aPhosphorusxanalysis 2aRiversxchemistry 2aSeasons 2aTime Factors 2aWater Movements 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysis 2aWater Quality 0aNew Zealand1 aElliott, A.H.0 tScience of the total environment.g2011 Nov. 15, v. 409, no. 24 p.5392-5402dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2011.08.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03393naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245015700176300001600333520198700349592002802336650001202364650001602376650001702392650002002409650001402429650000902443650001802452650001502470650001202485650004002497653002702537653002202564653001302586653002402599653004102623653002202664700001702686700002002703700002102723700002002744773007702764856008502841852000902926655001202935IND60561752420221121232700.0170713e20170301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056175242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2016.10.1022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNardiello, Donatella10aCombined use of peptide ion and normalized delta scores to evaluate milk authenticity by ion-trap based proteomics coupled with error tolerant searching  ap. 684-692.  aA fundamental issue in proteomics is the peptide identification by database searching and the assessment of the goodness of fit between experimental and theoretical data. Despite the different number of ways to measure the quality of search results, the definition of a scoring criterion is still highly desirable in ion-trap based proteomics. Indeed, in order to fully take advantage of a low resolution MS/MS dataset, it is essential to strike a balance between greater information capture and reduced number of incorrect peptide assignments. In addition, the development of user-specified rules is a crucial aspect when very similar proteins of the same family are analyzed in order to infer the origin species.In this study, a post-processing validation scheme is provided for the evaluation of proteomic data in shot-gun ion-trap proteomics, when a flexible database searching based on the error tolerant mode is adopted in combination with a low-specificity enzyme to maximize sequence coverage. To validate peptide assignments, we used standard β-casein digested with trypsin/chymotrypsin or trypsin alone and the popular search engine MASCOT to identify the relevant (known) peptide sequences. A linear combination between peptide ion score and normalized delta score (i.e. the difference between the best and the second best ion score, divided by the best score) is proposed to increase the accuracy in sequence assignments from low-resolution tandem mass spectra. Finally, the optimized post-processing database validation was successfully applied to the direct analysis of milk tryptic/chymotryptic digests of different origin, without resorting to two-dimensional electrophoresis that is usually performed for protein separation in ion-trap proteomics. The identification of species-specific amino acidic sequences among the validated peptide spectrum matches has allowed to fully discriminate between the animal species, so evaluating accurately the milk authenticity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimals 3abeta-casein 3achymotrypsin 3adata collection 3adatabases 3amilk 3amilk analysis 3aproteomics 3atrypsin 3atwo-dimensional gel electrophoresis 0aNormalized delta score 0aPeptide ion score 0aIon-trap 0aEnzymatic digestion 0aCollision-Induced Dissociation (CID) 0aMilk authenticity1 aNatale, Anna1 aPalermo, Carmen1 aQuinto, Maurizio1 aCentonze, Diego0 tTalanta.g2017 Mar. 01, v. 164 p.684-692dElsevier B.V.x0039-91407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2016.10.1023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02524naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003000147245014600177300001600323520095300339592002801292650002701320650002301347650003101370650001001401650004201411650001901453650002201472650001801494650001201512650001401524650003601538650004301574650003201617650001601649700002101665700001901686700002101705700002101726700002401747700002201771700001801793700001701811700002001828773009201848856008101940852000902021655001202030IND60440572620221117110302.0151024e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044057262DNAL7 a10.1007/s12562-015-0913-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJirapongpairoj, Walissara10aDevelopment of consensus qPCR primers to detect cytokine genes in three amberjack species: Seriola quinqueradiata, S. lalandi and S. dumerili  ap. 907-914.  aPartial sequences of cytokine genes IFNγ, IL-1β, IL-8, IL-10, and TNFα were identified from next-generation sequencing data for three amberjack species: Seriola quinqueradiata, S. lalandi and S. dumerili. The cytokine genes had more than 90 % nucleotide identity among the three species. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) primers were designed from the consensus sequences to detect cytokine genes. The specificities of consensus qPCR primers were investigated in the head kidney of three amberjack species treated with formalin-killed cells (FKC) of Vibrio anguillarum and polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid [poly(I:C)] at 3 h post injection (hpi) using qPCR. The primers detected up-regulation of certain cytokine genes after FKC of V. anguillarum and poly(I:C) stimulation in all species examined. Consequently, the primers are suitable for studying and detecting cytokine genes after vaccination and pathogen infection in these three amberjack species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSeriola quinqueradiata 3aVibrio anguillarum 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3ainterleukin-10 3ainterleukin-1beta 3ainterleukin-8 3akidneys 3apathogens 3apolyinosinic-polycytidylic acid 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3avaccination1 aKobayashi, Keigo1 aFukuda, Yutaka1 aTakano, Tomokazu1 aSakai, Takamitsu1 aMatsuyama, Tomomasa1 aNakayasu, Chihaya1 aNozaki, Reiko1 aHirono, Ikuo1 aKondo, Hidehiro0 tFisheries science.g2015 Sept., v. 81, no. 5 p.907-914dSpringer Japanx0919-92687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12562-015-0913-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03746naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142100001600160245012100176300001800297520220200315592002802517650001902545650001202564650002402576650001602600650001602616650001002632650001402642650001202656650001402668650002702682650001402709650001202723650002302735650001202758650001102770650002602781650000902807650003702816650003402853650003502887650002302922700001702945700002102962700001502983773014002998856008103138852000903219655001203228IND4477375720221120133452.0120419e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447737572DNAL7 a216228742pmid7 a10.2527/jas.2011-39062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLaborda, P.10aSelection for ovulation rate in rabbits: Genetic parameters, direct response, and correlated response on litter size  ap. 2981-2987.  aThe aim of this work was to evaluate the response to 10 generations of selection for ovulation rate. Selection was based on the phenotypic value of ovulation rate, estimated at d 12 of the second gestation by laparoscopy. Selection pressure was approximately 30%. Line size was approximately 20 males and 80 females per generation. Traits recorded were ovulation rate at the second gestation, estimated by laparoscopy as the number of corpora lutea in both ovaries; ovulation rate at the last gestation, estimated postmortem; ovulation rate, analyzed as a single trait including ovulation rate at the second gestation and ovulation rate at the last gestation; right and left ovulation rates; ovulatory difference, estimated as the difference between the right and left ovulation rates; litter size, estimated as the total number of kits born and the number of kits born alive, both recorded at each parity. Totals of 1,477 and 3,031 records from 900 females were used to analyze ovulation rate and litter size, respectively, whereas 1,471 records were used to analyze ovulatory difference, right ovulation rate, and left ovulation rate. Data were analyzed using Bayesian methodology. Heritabilities of ovulation rate, litter size, number of kits born alive, right ovulation rate, left ovulation rate, and ovulatory difference were 0.16, 0.09, 0.08, 0.09, 0.04 and 0.03, respectively. Phenotypic correlations of ovulation rate with litter size, number of kits born alive, and ovulatory difference were 0.09, 0.01, and 0.14, respectively. Genetic correlations of ovulation rate with litter size and with number of kits born alive were estimated with low accuracy, and there was not much evidence for the sign of the correlation. The genetic correlation between ovulation rate and ovulatory difference was positive (P = 0.91). In 10 generations of selection, ovulation rate increased in 1.32 oocytes, with most of the response taking place in the right ovary (1.06 oocytes), but there was no correlated response on litter size (–0.15 kits). In summary, the direct response to selection for ovulation rate was relevant, but it did not modify litter size because of an increase in prenatal mortality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal ovaries 3afemales 3agenetic correlation 3alaparoscopy 3alitter size 3amales 3amortality 3aoocytes 3aovulation 3aphenotypic correlation 3apregnancy 3arabbits 3aselection response 2aAnimals 2aFemale 2aLitter Sizexgenetics 2aMale 2aOvulationxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aQuantitative Trait, Heritable 2aRabbitsxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aSelection, Genetic1 aMocé, M.

Compared to TCE and PCE, 1,1,1-TCA was more readily removed, and the concentration profiles of the three chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons (CAHs) during the reduction processes fit pseudo-first-order reaction rate models well. The surface area-normalized rate constants show that the 11% Ni Ni/Fe nanoparticles, which has the largest Brunauer–Emmett–Teller surface area, has the highest capacity for 1,1,1-TCA removal per unit surface area and that the 6% Ni sample was the best for removing TCE and PCE. The observed by-products suggested that hydrogenolysis was responsible for the dechlorination of CAHs in the presence of Ni/Fe nanoparticles. More Ni2+ was released during the degradation of 1,1,1-TCA than that of TCE and PCE because Ni will reduce the CAHs directly as a zerovalent metal does when hydrogen atoms in the Ni lattice are not sufficient due to the rapid incomplete dechlorination of 1,1,1-TCA. The different modes of adsorption of chloroalkane and chloroalkene onto the surfaces of Ni/Fe particles might play an important role in their dechlorination process.  aPublisher supplied data 3asurface area 3atetrachloroethylene 3airon 3amodels 3abyproducts 3ahydrogen 3anickel 3adechlorination 3aenvironmental technology 3ananoparticles 3atrichloroethylene 3aadsorption 0aNanoparticle 0ahydrocarbons 0achlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbon1 aJia, Nan1 aHan, Xiaolin1 aQiu, Zhaofu1 aLv, Shuguang1 aLin, Kuangfei1 aYing, Weichi0 tEnvironmental technology.g2016 Aug. 17, v. 37, no. 16 p.2088-2098dTaylor & Francisx1479-487X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09593330.2016.11419983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02689naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245006800167300001600235520166800251592002801919650000901947650002501956650001901981650001002000650001902010650001102029650001102040650001202051650001502063700002102078700002002099773009502119856008102214990002302295852000902318655001202327IND60093420520221118210947.0141103e20120528xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009342052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ces.2012.02.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOlsson, Johanna10aLateral fuel dispersion in a large-scale bubbling fluidized bed  ap. 148-159.  aThe lateral fuel dispersion in a large-scale (1.44m² in cross section) bubbling fluidized bed operated under ambient conditions has been investigated by means of particle tracking with video recording and subsequent digital image analysis. Wood chips and bark pellets were used as tracer particles. Characterization of the fuel mixing pattern was made by single tracer particle tracking while tracking of batches of tracer particles was applied to quantify the fuel mixing through lateral dispersion coefficients. The experimental technique shows good repeatability and dispersion coefficients are found to be in the order of 10⁻³m²/s. The lateral transport of the wood chips is observed to occur mainly while these are submerged in the dense bed. Increased fluidization velocity accentuates this pattern, i.e. the share of time spent in the dense bed increases. Only for the wood chips the fluidization velocity was found to have an influence on the lateral dispersion coefficient, which is due to that these are of larger size and lower density than the bark particles. Diffusion-type modeling of the horizontal fuel dispersion is discussed, concluding that such an approach is not suitable in cases with low lateral fuel mixing rate or with a characteristic mixing length in the same order as the lateral length scale of the bed. As alternative, this paper proposes a macroscopic modeling approach for the lateral fuel mixing, which includes physical parameters relating to the local mixing mechanisms, operational conditions and fuel particle properties. The proposed model is shown to give an adequate macroscopic description of the lateral fuel mixing.  aPublisher supplied data 3abark 3achemical engineering 3afluidized beds 3afuels 3aimage analysis 3amixing 3amodels 3apellets 3awood chips1 aPallarès, David1 aJohnsson, Filip0 tChemical engineering science.g2012 May 28, v. 74 p.148-159dElsevier Ltdx0009-25097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ces.2012.02.0273Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03088naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004600094024002200140024001900162040001800181100001900199245014300218300001600361506007600377520146000453592002801913506003701941650002701978650002402005650003102029650001302060650002802073650001402101650001502115650002002130650001102150650001602161650002402177653002002201653002902221700001902250700002602269700003102295700002202326700002002348773013702368856009202505852000902597655001202606IND60555219020221207090914.0161026e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055521902DNAL7 a10.12980/APJTB.4.2014APJTB-2014-00652doi7 aPMC40376492pmcid7 a251833252pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIzadi, Morteza13aAn overview of travel-associated central nervous system infectious diseases: risk assessment, general considerations and future directions  ap. 589-596.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aNervous system infections are among the most important diseases in travellers. Healthy travellers might be exposed to infectious agents of central nervous system, which may require in-patient care. Progressive course is not uncommon in this family of disorders and requires swift diagnosis. An overview of the available evidence in the field is, therefore, urgent to pave the way to increase the awareness of travel-medicine practitioners and highlights dark areas for future research. In November 2013, data were collected from PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Knowledge (1980 to 2013) including books, reviews, and peer-reviewed literature. Works pertained to pre-travel care, interventions, vaccinations related neurological infections were retrieved. Here we provide information on pre-travel care, vaccination, chronic nervous system disorders, and post-travel complications. Recommendations with regard to knowledge gaps, and state-of-the-art research are made. Given an increasing number of international travellers, novel dynamic ways are available for physicians to monitor spread of central nervous system infections. Newer research has made great progresses in developing newer medications, detecting the spread of infections and the public awareness. Despite an ongoing scientific discussion in the field of travel medicine, further research is required for vaccine development, state-of-the-art laboratory tests, and genetic engineering of vectors.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acentral nervous system 3ainfectious diseases 3alaboratory experimentation 3amedicine 3anervous system diseases 3apathogens 3aphysicians 3arisk assessment 3atravel 3avaccination 3avaccine development 0aTravel medicine 0aNervous system disorders1 aIs'haqi, Arman1 aIs'haqi, Mohammad Ali1 aJafari, Nematollah Jonaidi1 aRahamaty, Fatemeh1 aBanki, Abdolali0 tAsian Pacific Journal of Tropical Biomedicine.g2014 Aug., v. 4 p.589-596dElsevier B.V.aHainan Medical Universityx2221-16917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.12980/APJTB.4.2014APJTB-2014-00653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02257naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245018300166300001600349520101300365592002801378650002701406650002401433650000901457650001801466650002201484650002001506650002001526650001401546650002301560650001401583650001701597700001701614700001501631700001501646700001601661773009201677856008101769852000901850655001201859IND60440572720221117110140.0151024e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044057272DNAL7 a10.1007/s12562-015-0916-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiao, Mingling10aOptimum dietary proportion of soybean meal with fish meal, and its effects on growth, digestibility, and digestive enzyme activity of juvenile sea cucumber Apostichopus japonicus  ap. 915-922.  aThe current study aimed to determine the effects of dietary proportions of soybean meal (SM) with fish meal (FM) on growth performance, digestibility, and digestive enzyme activity of juvenile sea cucumber Apostichopus japonicus. Diets with six different proportions of SM with FM (0/100, 20/80, 40/60, 60/40, 80/20, and 100/0) were fed to sea cucumbers (1.00 ± 0.01 g) for 80 days. With dietary SM proportions under 60 %, body weight gain and protein efficiency ratios first increased and subsequently decreased. Feed conversion ratios for diets with 60 % SM decreased initially and then maintained a minimum value. Sea cucumbers fed a diet containing 40 % SM showed significantly (P < 0.05) higher digestibility than those with other treatments, and showed significantly (P < 0.05) higher protease activity than sea cucumbers fed diets containing 0 and 20 % SM. Based on growth performance, we can conclude that the optimum dietary proportion of SM with FM for juvenile sea cucumbers is 60/40.  aPublisher supplied data 3aApostichopus japonicus 3abody weight changes 3adiet 3adigestibility 3adigestive enzymes 3aenzyme activity 3afeed conversion 3afish meal 3agrowth performance 3ajuveniles 3asoybean meal1 aRen, Tongjun1 aHe, Lijuan1 aHan, Yuzhe1 aKong, Bill,0 tFisheries science.g2015 Sept., v. 81, no. 5 p.915-922dSpringer Japanx0919-92687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12562-015-0916-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01746naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001600112245006400128300001400192520077100206592002800977650002201005650001201027650002301039650002201062650001401084650001501098650003001113653001101143653001601154653002201170700001601192700001801208700001701226773014401243852000901387655001201396IND60706310820221119144714.0200807e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070631082DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBadhe, P.L.10aGenetic divergence in cowpea (Vigna unguiculata (L.)

To provide a retrospective evaluation of amlodipine use in psittacine birds, medical records were reviewed for all avian patients prescribed amlodipine for treatment for the presumptive diagnosis of hypertension, based on clinical signs and indirect blood pressure measurements. Five birds were treated with amlodipine between 2010 and 2018. The median age was 33 years (range, 22–37 years) and 3/5 birds presented for ataxia or seizures. The median indirect systolic blood pressure at diagnosis was 243 mm Hg (range, 200–275 mm Hg). In 3/5 birds, amlodipine was the only drug prescribed, whereas, in 2/5 birds, enalapril was also prescribed in addition to amlodipine. In addition to the prescription of enalapril, blood pressure measurements were obtained indirectly, which are variables to be considered in this report. The initial median dose of amlodipine prescribed was 0.4 mg/kg (range, 0.1–0.4 mg/kg) PO q24h. In 3/5 birds, amlodipine administration was increased either in dose or frequency. Median follow-up time was 25 months (range, 2–55 months) after the initiation of amlodipine treatment. Owners in all 5 cases reported improvement of clinical signs by a median time of 2 months (range, 1–15 months). Three of 5 birds (60%) demonstrated a decreasing trend in blood pressure during the first 6 months after treatment with amlodipine was started (average, ≥20% decrease). Prospective, controlled studies are needed to investigate the efficacy of amlodipine in psittacine birds.  aPublisher supplied data 3abirds 3acalcium channel blockers 3ahypertension 3amedicine 3aretrospective studies 3asurgery 3asystolic blood pressure 0ablood pressure 0aamlodipine 0acalcium channel blocker 0apsittacine birds 0aavian1 aMans, Christoph0 tJournal of avian medicine and surgery.g2021 July 7, v. 35, no. 2 p.155-160dAssociation of Avian VeterinarianswJournal:J000000099x1082-67427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1647/19-000163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03588naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245012100170300001600291520168000307592002801987650001802015650001902033650001602052650001802068650001502086650001502101650001702116650001902133650001502152650001802167650001102185650001702196650002402213650002002237650001902257650001802276650002602294650002202320650001402342650001802356650001802374650002202392650002202414650001502436650002502451650001802476650001802494653001002512653001902522653001502541653001802556653002902574653002402603700001902627700002002646700001702666700002302683700001802706773009602724856008502820852000902905655001202914IND60589491520221122061620.0201125e20180515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058949152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.watres.2018.02.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGerrity, Daniel10aMicrobial community characterization of ozone-biofiltration systems in drinking water and potable reuse applications  ap. 207-219.  aMicrobial community structure in the ozone-biofiltration systems of two drinking water and two wastewater treatment facilities was characterized using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Collectively, these datasets enabled comparisons by facility, water type (drinking water, wastewater), pre-oxidation (ozonation, chlorination), media type (anthracite, activated carbon), media depth, and backwash dynamics. Proteobacteria was the most abundant phylum in drinking water filters, whereas Bacteroidetes, Chloroflexi, Firmicutes, and Planctomycetes were differentially abundant in wastewater filters. A positive correlation was observed between media depth and relative abundance of Cyanobacteria in drinking water filters, but there was only a slight increase in one alpha diversity metric with depth in the wastewater filters. Media type had a significant effect on beta but not alpha diversity in drinking water and wastewater filters. Pre-ozonation caused a significant decrease in alpha diversity in the wastewater filters, but the effect on beta diversity was not statistically significant. An evaluation of backwash dynamics resulted in two notable observations: (1) endosymbionts such as Neochlamydia and Legionella increased in relative abundance following backwashing and (2) nitrogen-fixing Bradyrhizobium dominated the microbial community in wastewater filters operated with infrequent backwashing. Bradyrhizobium is known to generate extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), which may adversely impact biofilter performance and effluent water quality. These findings have important implications for public health and the operation and resiliency of biofiltration systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacteroidetes 3aBradyrhizobium 3aChloroflexi 3aCyanobacteria 3aFirmicutes 3aLegionella 3aNeochlamydia 3aPlanctomycetes 3abiofilters 3abiofiltration 3acarbon 3achlorination 3acommunity structure 3adata collection 3adrinking water 3aendosymbionts 3amicrobial communities 3anitrogen fixation 3aozonation 3apublic health 3aribosomal RNA 3asequence analysis 3aspecies diversity 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 3awater filters 3awater quality 0aOzone 0aDrinking water 0aWastewater 0aBiofiltration 0a16S rRNA gene sequencing 0aMicrobial community1 aArnold, Mayara1 aDickenson, Eric1 aMoser, Duane1 aSackett, Joshua D.1 aWert, Eric C.0 tWater research.g2018 May 15, v. 135 p.207-219dElsevier LtdwJournal:1966x0043-13547nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2018.02.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03153naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001400144245010600158300002000264520139200284592002801676650002401704650002001728650002101748650001601769650001501785650001801800650000901818650001401827650001101841650001101852650002101863650001901884650003701903653002401940653003101964653002101995653002102016653001702037700001202054700005502066700001902121700001902140700001602159700003002175700005502205700001302260700001902273700001402292700005302306773014102359856007802500852000902578655001202587IND60645701220221119111913.0190529e20190506xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064570122DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.9b024422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGu, Youdi10aOxygen-Valve Formed in Cobaltite-Based Heterostructures by Ionic Liquid and Ferroelectric Dual-Gating  ap. 19584-19595.  aManipulation of oxygen vacancies via electric-field-controlled ionic liquid gating has been reported in many model systems within the emergent fields of oxide electronics and iontronics. It is then significant to investigate the oxygen vacancy formation/annihilation and migration across an additional ferroelectric layer with ionic liquid gating. Here, we report that via a combination of ionic liquid and ferroelectric gating, the remote control of oxygen vacancies and magnetic phase transition can be achieved in SrCoO₂.₅ films capped with an ultrathin ferroelectric BaTiO₃ layer at room temperature. The ultrathin BaTiO₃ layer acts as an atomic oxygen valve and is semitransparent to oxygen-ion transport due to the competing interaction between vertical electron tunneling and ferroelectric polarization plus surface electrochemical changes in itself, thus resulting in the striking emergence of new mixed-phase SrCoOₓ. The lateral coexistence of brownmillerite phase SrCoO₂.₅ and perovskite phase SrCoO₃₋δ was directly observed by transmission electron microscopy. Besides the fundamental significance of long-range interaction in ionic liquid gating, the ability to control the flow of oxygen ions across the heterointerface by the oxygen valve provides a new approach on the atomic scale for designing multistate memories, sensors, and solid-oxide fuel cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3abarium titanate 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectronics 3afuel cells 3aionic liquids 3aions 3amagnetism 3amodels 3aoxygen 3aphase transition 3aremote control 3atransmission electron microscopy 0aionic liquid gating 0aferroelectric polarization 0aoxygen vacancies 0aphase transition 0aoxygen valve1 aXu, Kun1 aSong, Cheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7651-90311 aZhong, Xiaoyan1 aZhang, Hongrui1 aMao, Haijun1 aSaleem, Muhammad Shahrukh1 aSun, Jirong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1238-87701 aLiu, Wei1 aZhang, Zhidong1 aPan, Feng1 aZhu, Jing1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2175-94760 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2019 May 06, v. 11, no. 21 p.19584-19595dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b024423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02817naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100006200142245009500204300001600299520161800315592002801933650002401961650001101985650000901996650001202005650001202017650001502029650001502044650001502059650002302074650001502097650001102112650001802123650001102141700002202152700002102174773013902195856007602334852000902410655001202419IND60675352220221116141335.0191106e20191009xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067535222DNAL7 a10.3398/064.079.03102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGogan, Peter J.

We assessed seasonal movement and distribution patterns and individual fidelity to those patterns, along with seasonal habitat selection and survival rates. Twenty-three percent of the deer were nonmigratory, remaining on the winter range year-round, and 77% were migratory, moving 10–104 km from winter to summer ranges. No deer switched between migratory and nonmigratory status. All migratory deer that were monitored for ≥2 years exhibited traditional movement patterns and utilized the same winter and summer ranges in all years. Mean winter and summer home range sizes for migratory deer were 1076 ha (SE 129) and 1527 ha (SE 249), respectively, and mean home range size for resident deer was 3100 ha (SE 902). There was a dichotomy in winter habitat use, with one group of deer selecting cultivated and grassland vegetation land cover classes and a second group of deer selecting shrubland and grassland vegetation land cover classes. A dichotomy in summer habitat use was evident between those deer selecting for unburned forest and avoiding all burned land cover classes and those deer selecting for moderate and high burn intensity land cover classes and avoiding unburned forest. We estimated annual mean survival at 0.813 (SE 0.028) and found no differences in survival rates among migratory deer, nonmigratory deer, or deer exhibiting differences in winter or summer habitat selection patterns.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOdocoileus hemionus 3aadults 3adeer 3afemales 3aforests 3agrasslands 3ahome range 3aland cover 3amigratory behavior 3ashrublands 3asummer 3asurvival rate 3awinter1 aKlaver, Robert W.1 aOlexa, Edward M.0 tWestern North American naturalist.g2019 Oct. 9, v. 79, no. 3 p.403-427dBrigham Young UniversitywJournal:jnl3973452x1527-09047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3398/064.079.03103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02210naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004600094024002200140024001900162040001800181100001900199245009900218300001600317506007600333520072700409592002801136506003701164650001901201650002701220650001601247650001701263650002301280650001101303650002101314650001401335650001701349653001601366653001501382653002501397653002401422653002401446700002101470700002301491773013701514856009201651852000901743655001201752IND60555219220221207090910.0161026e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055521922DNAL7 a10.12980/APJTB.4.2014APJTB-2014-00592doi7 aPMC40376522pmcid7 a251833282pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSöyüt, Hakan10aImpact of antibacterial drugs on human serum paraoxonase-1 (hPON1) activity: an in vitro study  ap. 603-609.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTo investigate the in vitro effects of the antibacterial drugs, meropenem trihydrate, piperacillin sodium, and cefoperazone sodium, on the activity of human serum paraoxonase (hPON1).hPON1 was purified from human serum using simple chromatographic methods, including DEAE-Sephadex anion exchange and Sephadex G-200 gel filtration chromatography.The three antibacterial drugs decreased in vitro hPON1 activity.

However, little is known about the nature and functional mechanism of bacterial effects on plant defense responses towards herbivores. We explored the role of microbes present in extracts of oral secretion (OS) isolated from larvae of Spodoptera litura, a generalist herbivore, in phytohormone signaling‐dependent defense responses in Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis). In response to mechanical damage (MD) with application of bacteria‐free OS (OS–) prepared by sterilization or filtration of OS, Arabidopsis leaves exhibited enhanced de novo synthesis of oxylipins, and induction of transcript abundance of the responsible genes, in comparison to those in leaves with MD + nonsterilized OS (OS⁺), indicating that OS bacteria serve as suppressors of these genes. By contrast, de novo synthesis/signaling of salicylic acid and signaling of abscisic acid were enhanced by OS bacteria. These signaling networks were cross‐regulated by each other. Meta‐analysis of OS bacteria identified 70 bacterial strains. Among them was Staphylococcus epidermidis, an anaerobic staphylococcus that was shown to contribute to the suppression/manipulation of phytohormone‐dependent plant defense signaling. The presence of OS bacteria was consequently beneficial for S. litura larvae hosted by Brassicaceae.  aPublisher supplied data  a20H02951cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) KAKENHI  a20K15878cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) KAKENHI  a20H04786cMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) Grants‐in‐Aid for Scientific Research on Innovative Areas  a18H04786cMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) Grants‐in‐Aid for Scientific Research on Innovative Areas  cJoint Research Program implemented at the Institute of Plant Science and Resources, Okayama University  cNagase Science and Technology Foundation 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aSpodoptera litura 3aStaphylococcus epidermidis 3aabscisic acid 3afiltration 3aherbivores 3amechanical damage 3ameta-analysis 3aoxylipins 3asalicylic acid 3asecretion1 aSumioka, Hiroka1 aTakiguchi, Mayu1 aUemura, Takuya1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3616-91851 aKihara, Yuka1 aShinya, Tomonori1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1837-138X1 aGalis, Ivan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9840-88451 aArimura, Gen‐ichiro1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3371-04690 tThe new phytologist.g2021 Sept., v. 231, no. 5 p.2029-2038dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44665x0028-646X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/nph.174443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02015naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245011900164300001600283520095400299592002801253650000801281650002001289650002101309650003201330650001901362650001401381700001501395700001901410700001801429700001501447773009001462856008101552990002301633852000901656655001201665IND60108713420221120025254.0141108e20130301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010871342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.snb.2012.12.1242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Zhenning10aElectrochemical biosensing method for the detection of DNA methylation and assay of the methyltransferase activity  ap. 412-417.  aIn this article, we presented an electrochemical method for detection of DNA methylation and assay of DNA methyltransferase (MTase) activity using methylene blue (MB) as electrochemical indicator. After the DNA hybrid was methylated by T.aqI MTase, it could not be cleaved by HincII endonuclease. On the contrary, the double DNA without methylation could be cleaved, which would decrease the amount of intercalated MB. Thus, the DNA methylation status and MTase activity could be determinated based on the voltammetric signal change of MB. The methylation site could be found based on this method. The electrochemical signal of MB increased linearly with increasing T.aqI MTase concentration from 0.1 to 100U/mL. Moreover, the inhibition investigation demonstrated that fisetin could inhibit the T.aqI MTase activity with the IC₅₀ value of 280μM. Therefore, the screening of the inhibitors of MTase could be accomplished using the novel method.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDNA methylation 3aelectrochemistry 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3amethylene blue 3ascreening1 aWang, Mo.,1 aZhou, Tingting1 aYin, Huanshun1 aAi, Shiyun0 tSensors and actuators.g2013 Mar. 1, v. 178 p.412-417dElsevier B.V.x0925-40057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.snb.2012.12.1243Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03738naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002200189245012500211300002000336520205400356592002802410650002102438650001102459650001402470650002102484650001502505650002802520650002002548650001002568650001102578650001402589650002202603650001802625650000902643650001702652650004302669650001402712650003202726650002202758650001502780700002302795700002102818700001802839700002002857700002002877700002002897700001902917773012202936856008203058990002303140852000903163655001203172IND60100200620221118004414.0141105e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010020062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jaci.2012.07.0132doi7 aPMC34704762pmcid7 a230211432pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBauer, Rebecca N.10aInfluenza enhances caspase-1 in bronchial epithelial cells from asthmatic volunteers and is associated with pathogenesis  ap. 958-967.e14.  aBACKGROUND: The leading cause of asthma exacerbation is respiratory viral infection. Innate antiviral defense pathways are altered in the asthmatic epithelium, yet involvement of inflammasome signaling in virus-induced asthma exacerbation is not known. OBJECTIVE: This study compared influenza-induced activation of inflammasome and innate immune signaling in human bronchial epithelial cells from volunteers with and without asthma and investigated the role of caspase-1 in epithelial cell antiviral defense. METHODS: Differentiated primary human bronchial epithelial cells from volunteers with and without asthma were infected with influenza A virus. An inflammasome-specific quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction array was used to compare baseline and influenza-induced gene expression profiles. Cytokine secretion, innate immune gene expression, and viral replication were compared between human bronchial epithelial cells from volunteers with and without asthma. Immunofluorescence microscopy was used to evaluate caspase-1 and PYCARD colocalization. Tracheal epithelial cells from caspase-1–deficient or wild-type mice were infected with influenza and assessed for antiviral gene expression and viral replication. RESULTS: Human bronchial epithelial cells from asthmatic volunteers had altered influenza-induced expression of inflammasome-related and innate immune signaling components, which correlated with enhanced production of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α. Specifically, influenza-induced caspase-1 expression was enhanced and localization differed in human bronchial epithelial cells from asthmatic volunteers compared to volunteers without asthma. Influenza-infected tracheal epithelial cells from caspase-1–deficient mice had reduced expression of antiviral genes and viral replication. CONCLUSION: Caspase-1 plays an important role in the airway epithelial cell response to influenza infection, which is enhanced in asthmatic volunteers, and may contribute to the enhanced influenza-related pathogenesis observed in vivo.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOrthomyxoviridae 3aasthma 3acaspase-1 3aepithelial cells 3aepithelium 3afluorescence microscopy 3agene expression 3agenes 3ahumans 3ainfluenza 3ainterleukin-1beta 3ainterleukin-6 3amice 3apathogenesis 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asecretion 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3avirus replication 3avolunteers1 aBrighton, Luisa E.1 aMueller, Loretta1 aXiang, Zhidan1 aRager, Julia E.1 aFry, Rebecca C.1 aPeden, David B.1 aJaspers, Ilona0 tThe Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology.g2012 Oct., v. 130, no. 4 p.958-967.e14dMosby, Inc.x0091-67497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaci.2012.07.0133Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02250naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245013400166300001600300520094500316592002801261650001601289650000901305650001101314650002001325650003901345650001101384650001701395650001901412650001101431650002001442650002201462650001801484650001301502650001301515700002201528700001801550700001901568700002101587773011701608856008201725852000901807655001201816IND60100646320221120075013.0141105e20110115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010064632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2010.09.0672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHartmann, Eva10aCharacterization and quantification of Sm(III)/ and Cm(III)/clay mineral outer-sphere species by TRLFS in D₂O and EXAFS studies  ap. 562-568.  aIn order to assess the long-term safety of deep radioactive waste repositories, a precise characterization of the different sorption processes on a molecular basis and the exact definition of geochemical boundary conditions for their relevance are of immense importance. Through sorption on various minerals the migration of radionuclides will be hindered and their retention will be ensured. Using time-resolved laser fluorescence spectroscopy (TRLFS) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy, it was possible to identify outer-sphere sorbed trivalent lanthanides and actinides onto different montmorillonites and illite. Furthermore, the quantification of Cm(III)/clay outer-sphere sorption in D₂O at different ionic strengths was shown. The results were confirmed by ion exchange model calculations. Finally, the structural parameters of a Sm(III)/clay outer-sphere complex were obtained by EXAFS measurements.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aclay 3acurium 3adeuterium oxide 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3aillite 3aion exchange 3aionic strength 3amodels 3amontmorillonite 3aradioactive waste 3aradionuclides 3asamarium 3asorption1 aBrendebach, Boris1 aPolly, Robert1 aGeckeis, Horst1 aStumpf, Thorsten0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2011 Jan. 15, v. 353, no. 2 p.562-568dElsevier Inc.x0021-97977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2010.09.0673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01933naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245010600169300001400275520091000289592002801199650002201227650000801249650002201257650001101279650000901290650001101299650001701310700001901327700002001346700001701366773008401383856008401467990002301551852000901574655001201583IND60104035220221117233352.0141107e20131001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010403522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.matlet.2013.06.0742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYoo, Chung-Yul14aThe effects of Fe-substitution on the crystal structure and oxygen permeability of PrBaCo₂O₅₊δ  ap. 65-68.  aA series of double layered perovskites, PrBaCo₂₋ₓFeₓO₅₊δ (x=0, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2), are successfully prepared employing a solid state reaction. The effects of Fe substitution on the crystal structure and oxygen transport properties of PrBaCo₂O₅₊δ were investigated by X-ray diffraction and oxygen permeation experiments.

This type of mill belongs to the mostly used mills at all. In order to develop a predictive grinding model not only the material's reaction to the applied stress but also the stressing conditions within the mill, e.g. impact velocity, incidence angle, number of stress events, have to be known. The latter are strongly affected by the interactions between the fluid and the solid phase within the mill. Systematic flow investigations in the vicinity of the impact elements and in the region of the internal classifier have been performed by Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) and by numerical predictions of the fluid flow in the complete mill using a commercial CFD solver. Different pin geometries have been studied at various peripheral velocities of the grinding disk and the classifier. The classifier velocity does not influence the velocity profiles near the impact elements in the main flow direction and vice versa, the flow in the grinding zone has little influence on the classification. The velocity profile in front of the impact element, where the comminution process takes place, is constant with time and preserves a characteristic form independent of the operational conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aangle of incidence 3agrinding 3amodels 3aprediction1 aEpple, Philipp1 aBreuer, Michael1 aPeukert, Wolfgang1 aWirth, Karl-Ernst0 tPowder technology.g2011 July 25, v. 211, no. 1 p.19-27dElsevier B.V.x0032-59107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2011.03.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02170naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245012200170300001600292520109300308592002801401650002201429650002201451650002401473650002601497650001201523700001401535700001501549700001701564700001901581700002001600773008201620856008601702990002301788852000901811655001201820IND60110907620221117224535.0141109e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011090762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ultramic.2013.08.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBritton, T.B.10aAssessing the precision of strain measurements using electron backscatter diffraction – part 1: Detector assessment  ap. 126-135.  aWe analyse the link between precision of pattern shift measurements and the resolution of the measurement of elastic strain and lattice rotation using high resolution electron backscatter diffraction (HR-EBSD). This study combines analysis of high quality experimentally obtained diffraction patterns from single crystal silicon; high quality dynamical simulations using Bloch wave theory; quantitative measurements of the detector Modulation Transfer Function (MTF) and a numerical model. We have found that increases in exposure time, when 1×1 binning is selected, are the primary reason for the observed increase in sensitivity at greater than 2×2 binning and therefore use of software integration and high bit depth images enables a significant increase in strain resolution. This has been confirmed using simulated diffraction patterns which provide evidence that the ultimate theoretical resolution of the cross correlation based EBSD strain measurement technique with a 1000×1000 pixel image could be as low as 4.2×10⁻⁷ in strain based on a shift precision of 0.001 pixels.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputer software 3aexposure duration 3amathematical models 3aquantitative analysis 3asilicon1 aJiang, J.1 aClough, R.1 aTarleton, E.1 aKirkland, A.I.1 aWilkinson, A.J.0 tUltramicroscopy.g2013 Dec., v. 135 p.126-135dElsevier B.V.x0304-39917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ultramic.2013.08.0053Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03647naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100002200192245018700214300001800401500001500419506007600434520179200510592002802302506003702330650002702367650002102394650001202415650001302427650001302440650001302453650002002466650000902486650001102495650001702506650001402523650001402537650001302551650001102564650002002575650003102595650001702626650003102643653001602674653001102690653001802701653002002719653001502739653001902754653001102773653000902784700002202793700002402815773009902839856008602938852000903024655001203033IND60111298120221207133329.0190319e20130725xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011129812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2012.10.0332doi7 aPMC35781252pmcid7 a230928562pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNovotny, Laura A.10aKinetic analysis and evaluation of the mechanisms involved in the resolution of experimental nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae-induced otitis media after transcutaneous immunization  ap. 3417-3426.  a2019-12-04  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTranscutaneous immunization (TCI) is a simple and needle-free method with which to induce protective immune responses. Using a chinchilla model of nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHI)-induced otitis media (OM), we examined the efficacy afforded by TCI with a novel chimeric immunogen called ‘chimV4’ which targets two critical adhesins expressed by NTHI, outer membrane protein P5 and the majority subunit of NTHI Type IV pilus, PilA. Experimental OM was first established in cohorts of animals, and then TCI performed via a therapeutic immunization regime by rubbing vaccine formulations on hydrated pinnae. The kinetics of resolution of established experimental disease was evaluated by clinically-relevant assessments of OM, bacterial culture of planktonic and adherent NTHI within the middle ear and gross examination of the relative amount of NTHI mucosal biofilms within the middle ear space. Within seven days after primary TCI, a significant reduction in the signs of OM, significantly fewer NTHI adherent to the middle ear mucosa and significant resolution of mucosal biofilms was detected in animals that received chimV4+ the adjuvant LT(R192G-L211A), compared to animals administered LT(R192G-L211A) alone or saline by TCI (p<0.05) with eradication of NTHI within an additional seven days. The mechanism for rapid disease resolution involved efflux of activated dermal dendritic cells from the pinnae after TCI, secretion of factors chemotactic for CD4+ T-cells, induction of polyfunctional IFNγ- and IL-17-producing CD4+ T-cells and secretion of host defense peptide within the middle ear. These data support TCI as a therapeutic intervention against experimental NTHI-induced OM and begin to elucidate the host response to immunization by this noninvasive regimen.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aHaemophilus influenzae 3achemoattractants 3abiofilm 3aantigens 3afimbriae 3aadhesins 3adendritic cells 3aears 3amodels 3aotitis media 3achimerism 3asecretion 3avaccines 3amucosa 3aimmune response 3aCD4-positive T-lymphocytes 3aimmunization 3aChinchilla (Chinchillidae) 0achinchillas 0aOMP P5 0aType IV pilus 0aMucosal biofilm 0aChinchilla 0aDendritic cell 0achimv4 0admLT1 aClements, John D.1 aBakaletz, Lauren O.0 tVaccine.g2013 July 25, v. 31, no. 34 p.3417-3426dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2012.10.0333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02537naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002600150245011300176300001600289520149600305592002801801650001401829650002501843650002401868650002201892650001401914650002901928651001301957651001401970700001601984700001802000773008802018856008402106852000902190655001202199IND60107994620221119150747.0141108e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010799462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2011.07.0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEdwards, Erwin Elliot10aEnergy consumption in typical Caribbean office buildings: A potential short term solution to energy concerns  ap. 154-161.  aThis paper examines the feasibility of energy efficiency as a short term solution to the Caribbean’s energy problems. It considers energy consumption across selected office buildings in Barbados, typical of Caribbean architecture. By comparing their energy consumption to that of the energy consumption for the building with the “best observable” consumption in the selected group, the energy efficiency is determined. Data for five (5) buildings with similar characteristics were collected, analyzed and normalized to facilitate a direct comparison between them. The selected indicator was Energy Consumption per Unit Area (IE = E/A). On examining the equipment and technology (E&T) currently being used in these buildings a definite inefficiency resulting from this was identified. The undetermined inefficiency was allocated to management and operations (M&O). The “best observable” building had an E&T inefficiency of 10%. Results suggest that E&T is responsible for between 10% and 14% additional energy wastage while the inefficiency due to business processes is believed to be largely responsible for inefficiency beyond 14%. Overall inefficiency rose as high as 56%, indicating an opportunity for significant energy savings through an efficiency response. Electrical energy consumed in a building is shown to be not only related to physical space and E&T inefficiency, but also to an x-efficiency factor that is peculiar to the management and operations of that building.  aPublisher supplied data 3abuildings 3abusiness enterprises 3aenergy conservation 3aenergy efficiency 3aequipment 3arenewable energy sources 3aBarbados 3aCaribbean1 aIyare, O.S.1 aMoseley, L.L.0 tRenewable energy.g2012 Mar., v. 39, no. 1 p.154-161dElsevier Ltdx0960-14817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2011.07.0373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02155naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094024002200134024001900156040001800175100001500193245007500208300001800283506007600301520077400377592002801151506003701179650001501216650001301231650001101244650000901255650001201264650004401276650001901320650001101339700001501350700001301365700001701378700001801395700001801413700002201431700001701453700001701470700002001487773008301507856008601590852000901676655001201685IND60105402520221207134113.0141108e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010540252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.peptides.2011.04.0082doi7 aPMC35476782pmcid7 a215246722pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYe, Mingyu12aA novel conotoxin, qc16a, with a unique cysteine framework and folding  ap. 1159-1165.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aA novel conotoxin, qc16a, was identified from the venom of vermivorous Conus quercinus. qc16a has only 11 amino acid residues, DCQPCGHNVCC, with a unique cysteine pattern. Its disulfide connectivity was determined to be I–IV, II–III. The NMR structure shows that qc16a adopts a ribbon conformation with a simple beta-turn motif formed by residues Gly6, His7 and Asn8. qc16a causes depression symptom in mice when injected intracranially. Point mutation results showed that Asp1, His7 and Asn8 are all essential for the activity of qc16a. Electrophysiologically, qc16a has no strong effect on the whole-cell currents of neurons and the currents of Drosophila Shaker channels, human BK channels and NaV1.7 channels. Its specific target still remains to be identified.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDrosophila 3acysteine 3ahumans 3amice 3aneurons 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apoint mutation 3avenoms1 aHong, Jing1 aZhou, Mi1 aHuang, Lijun1 aShao, Xiaoxia1 aYang, Youshan1 aSigworth, Fred J.1 aChi, Chengwu1 aLin, Donghai1 aWang, Chunguang0 tPeptides.g2011 June, v. 32, no. 6 p.1159-1165dElsevier Inc.x0196-97817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.peptides.2011.04.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02423naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245011200170300001400282500001500296520122400311592002801535650001501563650001501578650001801593650001101611650001801622650002001640650001501660650001201675650001501687650002201702650000701724650001501731650001501746651001101761651001501772700001801787773010201805856008501907852000901992655001202001IND60101441120221122062657.0141106e20120330xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010144112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2011.12.0682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPratt, Bethany10aEffects of land cover, topography, and built structure on seasonal water quality at multiple spatial scales  ap. 48-58.  a2019-12-04  aThe relationship among land cover, topography, built structure and stream water quality in the Portland Metro region of Oregon and Clark County, Washington areas, USA, is analyzed using ordinary least squares (OLS) and geographically weighted (GWR) multiple regression models. Two scales of analysis, a sectional watershed and a buffer, offered a local and a global investigation of the sources of stream pollutants. Model accuracy, measured by R² values, fluctuated according to the scale, season, and regression method used. While most wet season water quality parameters are associated with urban land covers, most dry season water quality parameters are related topographic features such as elevation and slope. GWR models, which take into consideration local relations of spatial autocorrelation, had stronger results than OLS regression models. In the multiple regression models, sectioned watershed results were consistently better than the sectioned buffer results, except for dry season pH and stream temperature parameters. This suggests that while riparian land cover does have an effect on water quality, a wider contributing area needs to be included in order to account for distant sources of pollutants.  aPublisher supplied data 3adry season 3atopography 3awater quality 3amodels 3aleast squares 3aautocorrelation 3apollutants 3astreams 3awatersheds 3awater temperature 3apH 3aland cover 3awet season 3aOregon 0aWashington1 aChang, Heejun0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2012 Mar. 30, v. 209-210 p.48-58dElsevier B.V.x0304-38947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2011.12.0683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02219naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245016300169300001800332520108300350592002801433650001601461650001601477650001601493650002001509650004101529650002301570650003201593700001701625700001701642700002401659773010401683856008501787852000901872655001201881IND60100374720221120184422.0141105e20111001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010037472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jchromb.2011.08.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMehdinia, Ali10aAnalysis of cantharidin in false blister beetles (Coleoptera: Oedemeridae) by headspace solid-phase microextraction and gas chromatography–mass spectrometry  ap. 2897-2901.  aA headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) coupled to gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) method was developed to determine a type of terpenoid named as cantharidin in the false blister beetles, family Oedemeridae. The experimental parameters for HS-SPME method were optimized. Six commercial fibers for HS-SPME method development were tested and the divinylbenzene/carboxene/polydimethylsiloxane fiber was selected to provide the best detection of analyzed compound. The calibration curve showed linearity in the range of 0.1–50μgmL⁻¹, correlation coefficient (R²=0.992), limit of detection (0.01ngmL⁻¹) and quantitation (0.04ngmL⁻¹) were obtained for the proposed method. The relative standard deviations of intra-day and inter-day assays were 7.8 and 3.4%, respectively. The recovery values, obtained after spiking the beetle samples by three concentration levels of standard solution, were higher than 87%. The results indicated the successful application of the proposed method on the analysis of cantharidin from the false blister beetles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOedemeridae 3acantharidin 3acorrelation 3adetection limit 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3aheadspace analysis 3asolid phase microextraction1 aAsiabi, Mina1 aJabbari, Ali1 aAbtahi, S.

The common natriuretic peptide/helokinestatin precursor of the Gila Monster, Heloderma suspectum, encodes five helokinestatins of differing primary structures. Here we report the molecular cloning of a natriuretic peptide/helokinestatin precursor cDNA from a venom-derived cDNA library of the Mexican beaded lizard (Heloderma horridum). Deduction of the primary structure of the encoded precursor protein from this cloned cDNA template revealed that it consisted of 196 amino acid residues encoding a single natriuretic peptide and five helokinestatins. While the natriuretic peptide was of identical primary structure to its Gila Monster (H. suspectum) homolog, the encoded helokinestatins were not, with this region of the common precursor displaying some significant differences to its H. suspectum homolog. The helokinestatin-encoding region contained a single copy of helokinestatin-1, 2 copies of helokinestatin-3 and single copies of 2 novel peptides, (Phe)⁵-helokinestatin-2 (VPPAFVPLVPR) and helokinestatin-6 (GPPFNPPPFVDYEPR). All predicted peptides were found in reverse phase HPLC fractions of the same venom. Synthetic replicates of both novel helokinestatins were found to antagonize the relaxing effect of bradykinin on rat tail artery smooth muscle. Thus lizard venom continues to provide a source of novel biologically active peptides.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHeloderma horridum 3aHeloderma suspectum 3aamino acid sequences 3aamino acids 3abradykinin 3acDNA libraries 3acomplementary DNA 3alizards 3amolecular cloning 3anatriuretic peptides 3arats 3areversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography 3asmooth muscle 3asnakes 3atail 3avenoms1 aYang, Mu1 aZhou, Mei1 aWu, Yuxin1 aWang, Lei1 aChen, Tianbao1 aDing, Anwei1 aShaw, Chris0 tPeptides.g2011 June, v. 32, no. 6 p.1166-1171dElsevier Inc.x0196-97817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.peptides.2011.03.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02975naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245015400167300001600321520170500337592002802042650001602070650001402086650002502100650001302125650001902138650001702157650002102174650001302195650002402208650002202232650002502254650001202279650001302291650001502304650001702319700001602336700001802352773009302370856008102463852000902544655001202553IND60103483320221120102942.0141106e20110425xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010348332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lfs.2011.02.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTuei, Vivian C.10aEffects of human serum albumin complexed with free fatty acids on cell viability and insulin secretion in the hamster pancreatic β-cell line HIT-T15  ap. 810-818.  aAIMS: The effects of human serum albumin (HSA) complexed with various free fatty acids (FFAs) on ß-cells have not been studied in detail. In this study, we examined the effects of HSA and its mutants on FFA-induced cell viability changes and insulin secretion from the hamster pancreatic insulinoma cell line, HIT-TI5. MAIN METHODS: Cells were exposed to different FFAs in the presence of HSA or its mutants and/or bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 24h. Cell viability, apoptosis, insulin secretion, and unbound FFA (FFAᵤ) levels were determined. KEY FINDINGS: In the presence of 0.1mM HSA, palmitate and stearate induced significant cell death at 0.1mM or higher, whereas myristate, palmitoleate, oleate, elaidate, linoleate, linoelaidate, and conjugated linoleate showed minimal changes on cell viability. Furthermore, oleate and linoleate were clearly cytoprotective against palmitate-induced cell death. The apoptosis inhibitors, cyclosporin A (csA) and the caspase inhibitor ZVAD-FMK, did not completely prevent FFA-induced cell death, although ZVAD-FMK blocked apoptosis with no differences in the presence of either HSA or BSA. In addition, insulin secretion from the cells was significantly reduced in the presence of HSA/oleate complexes. We also found differential effects of HSA mutants complexed with FFAs on cell viability. SIGNIFICANCE: In summary, our results showed that saturated FFAs induced more cell death than unsaturated FFAs. Furthermore, modified HSA/FFA interactions caused by mutations of key amino acids involved in the binding of FFA to HSA resulted in changes in cell viability, suggesting a possible role of HSA polymorphism on FFA-induced changes in cellular functions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acids 3aapoptosis 3abovine serum albumin 3acaspases 3acell viability 3acyclosporine 3afree fatty acids 3ahamsters 3ahuman serum albumin 3ainsulin secretion 3aislets of Langerhans 3amutants 3amutation 3aoleic acid 3astearic acid1 aHa, Ji-Sook1 aHa, Chung-Eun0 tLife sciences.g2011 Apr. 25, v. 88, no. 17-18 p.810-818dElsevier Inc.x0024-32057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2011.02.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01951naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245006600167300001600233520100200249592002801251650001501279650001301294650002501307650001501332650001101347650003101358650000901389700001901398773009501417856008101512990002301593852000901616655001201625IND60110748520221120170243.0141109e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011074852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tcb.2013.04.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWelling, Maaike10aUncovering the true identity of naïve pluripotent stem cells  ap. 442-448.  aEmbryonic stem cells (ESCs) are pluripotent stem cells derived from the inner cell mass (ICM) of blastocyst embryos. Although first characterized over 30 years ago, the ontology of these cells remains elusive. Identifying the in vivo counterpart of murine ESCs will be essential for the derivation of stable ESC lines from other species. Several hypotheses exist concerning the ontology of murine ESCs. Recent data demonstrate that ESCs emerge from a subpopulation of ICM cells that transit through a Blimp1-positive state, suggesting that perhaps a germ cell developmental program underlies ESC derivation and maintenance. Alternatively, the common dependence of ESCs and diapause embryos on the cytokine LIF (leukemia inhibitory factor) has been thought to signify that murine ESCs employ a diapause-like program for their maintenance of pluripotency. Here we review different hypotheses regarding the nature of murine ESCs and discuss their implications for human pluripotent stem cell biology.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablastocyst 3adiapause 3aembryonic stem cells 3agerm cells 3ahumans 3aleukemia inhibitory factor 3amice1 aGeijsen, Niels0 tTrends in cell biology.g2013 Sept., v. 23, no. 9 p.442-448dElsevier Ltdx0962-89247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tcb.2013.04.0043Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02424naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245016400171300001400335520137600349592002801725650001501753650001601768650001101784650001301795650001201808650000901820650001501829650001801844700001801862700002701880773008601907856008401993852000902077655001202086IND60107994920221119150712.0141108e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010799492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2011.08.0352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBhatt, Praghnesh10aCoordinated control of TCPS and SMES for frequency regulation of interconnected restructured power systems with dynamic participation from DFIG based wind farm  ap. 40-50.  aAmong the several wind generation technologies, variable-speed wind turbines utilizing doubly fed induction generators (DFIG) are gaining momentum in the power industry. Increased penetration of these wind turbine generators displaces conventional synchronous generators which results in erosion of system frequency. With this assertion, the paper analyzes the dynamic participation of DFIG for frequency control of an interconnected two-area power system in restructured competitive electricity market. Frequency control support function responding proportionally to frequency deviation is proposed to take out the kinetic energy of wind turbine for improving the frequency response of the system. Impacts of varying wind penetration in the system and varying active power support from DFIG on frequency control have been investigated. The presence of thyristor controlled phase shifter (TCPS) in series with the tie-line and Superconducting Magnetic Energy Storage (SMES) at the terminal of one area in conjunction with dynamic active power support from DFIG results in optimal transient performance for PoolCo transactions. Integral gains of AGC loop and parameters of TCPS and SMES are optimized through craziness-based particle swarm optimization (CRPSO) in order to have optimal transient responses of area frequencies, tie-line power deviation and DFIG parameters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aelectricity 3aenergy 3aindustry 3amarkets 3awind 3awind power 3awind turbines1 aGhoshal, S.P.1 aRāẏa, Raṇajit̲a,0 tRenewable energy.g2012 Apr., v. 40, no. 1 p.40-50dElsevier Ltdx0960-14817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2011.08.0353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02000naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094024002200134024001900156040001800175100002000193245007400213300001400287520096600301592002801267650002501295650002701320650001801347650003701365700001901402700002001421700002301441773008001464856008601544990002301630852000901653655001201662IND60110908020221117224449.0141109e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011090802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ultramic.2013.05.0102doi7 aPMC38085012pmcid7 a238720402pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWelch, David A.10aSimulating realistic imaging conditions for in situ liquid microscopy  ap. 36-42.  aIn situ transmission electron microscopy enables the imaging of biological cells, macromolecular protein complexes, nanoparticles, and other systems in a near-native environment. In order to improve interpretation of image contrast features and also predict ideal imaging conditions ahead of time, new virtual electron microscopic techniques are needed. A technique for virtual fluid-stage high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy with the multislice method is presented that enables the virtual imaging of model fluid-stage systems composed of millions of atoms. The virtual technique is exemplified by simulating images of PbS nanoparticles under different imaging conditions and the results agree with previous experimental findings. General insight is obtained on the influence of the effects of fluid path length, membrane thickness, nanoparticle position, defocus and other microscope parameters on attainable image quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aimage interpretation 3amultiprotein complexes 3ananoparticles 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aFaller, Roland1 aEvans, James E.1 aBrowning, Nigel D.0 tUltramicroscopy.g2013 Dec., v. 135 p.36-42dElsevier B.V.x0304-39917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ultramic.2013.05.0103Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02918naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245015800171300001600329520161300345592002801958650002201986650001702008650001002025650000902035650001802044650003202062650002202094650001702116650001602133650001402149700002202163700002202185700002202207700002002229700002402249700002702273773011702300856008202417852000902499655001202508IND60100833620221119233628.0141105e20120715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010083362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2012.04.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMisiūnas, Audrius10aHorse heart cytochrome c entrapped into the hydrated liquid-crystalline phases of phytantriol: X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopic characterization  ap. 232-240.  aSmall angle X-ray diffraction (SAXD), resonance Raman (RR) spectroscopy with 413nm excitation, and non-resonance Raman technique with 785nm excitation were used to probe the influence of entrapped cytochrome c (Cyt c) on the structure of hydrated phytantriol (Phyt) liquid-crystalline phases as well as conformational changes of heme group and secondary structure of the protein. SAXD measurements indicated that incorporation of Cyt c affects both nanostructure dimensions and type of liquid-crystalline phases of hydrated Phyt. The unit cell dimensions decrease with increasing Cyt c concentration for all phases. In addition, protein perturbs the nanostructure of Q²³⁰ and Q²²⁴ liquid-crystalline phases of hydrated Phyt to such an extent that they transform into the Q²²⁹ phase with the Im3m space group. RR data revealed that entrapment of oxidized Cyt c into the Q²³⁰ phase at 1wt.% content results in near complete reduction of central iron ion of the heme group, while its low-spin state and six-ligand coordination configuration are preserved. Based on the analysis of heme out-of-plane folding vibration near 568cm⁻¹ (γ₂₁) and ν₄₈ mode at 633cm⁻¹, it was demonstrated that the protein matrix tension on the heme group is relaxed upon incorporation of protein into Q²³⁰ phase. Non-resonant Raman bands of difference spectra showed the preservation of α-helix secondary structure of Cyt c in the liquid-crystalline phase at relatively high (5wt.%) content. The Cyt c induced spectroscopic changes of Phyt bands were found to be similar as decrease in temperature.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3acytochrome c 3aheart 3aheme 3ananomaterials 3aprotein secondary structure 3aspectral analysis 3aspectroscopy 3atemperature 3avibration1 aNiaura, Gediminas1 aBarauskas, Justas1 aMeškys, Rolandas1 aRutkienė, Rasa1 aRazumas, Valdemaras1 aNylander, T.q(Tommy),0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2012 July 15, v. 378, no. 1 p.232-240dElsevier Inc.x0021-97977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2012.04.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01777naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245011700166300001400283500001500297520072600312592002801038650001701066650001701083650001701100650001501117650002101132653001401153700001901167700002101186700002101207773008601228856008101314990002301395852000901418655001201427IND60108790520221118000201.0141108e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010879052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.snb.2012.09.0662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCho, Hong-Chan10aSensing behavior of solid-state impedancemetric NOx sensor using solid electrolyte transducer and oxide receptor  ap. 94-98.  a2019-12-04  aSolid-electrolyte impedancemetric NOx (NOx; NO, NO₂) sensor devices were designed by using metal oxides (Fe₂O₃, Co₃O₄, NiO, CuO, ZnO) as a receptor material and an 8mol%-yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) plate as a solid electrolyte transducer material.

Previous studies have investigated the effect of energy extraction by wave energy devices through the use of spectral models such as SWAN, representing a wave farm as one or more barriers within the model domain and applying a constant wave energy transmission percentage across the whole wave spectrum incident at the barrier. However, this is an unrealistic representation of the behaviour of real wave energy converters. These will exhibit frequency-dependent energy absorption characteristics that will correspond to the spectral response of the device, and may reflect its ability to be tuned to extract energy at particular frequencies. This study describes a modification of the SWAN source code to enable frequency-dependent wave energy transmission through a barrier. A detailed analysis of the wave climate at the Wave Hub wave farm site is also presented, with a particular focus on the occurrence of bimodal sea states. The modified SWAN code is used to assess how impact predictions for typically occurring sea states may differ when using frequency-dependent rather than constant wave energy transmission, with reference to a previous study using the unmodified code (Millar, Smith and Reeve, 2007 [1]). The results illustrate the dependence of the magnitude of the impact on both the response function of the devices and the spectral sea state in which they are operating.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3acase studies 3aclimate 3aenergy conversion 3afarms 3amodels 3aprediction 3awater power1 aPearce, Charles1 aMillar, Dean L.0 tRenewable energy.g2012 Apr., v. 40, no. 1 p.51-64dElsevier Ltdx0960-14817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2011.09.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01752naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245008600166300001800252520081700270592002801087650001601115650002301131650001901154650001301173650001501186650002001201700001901221700001801240773009001258856008101348852000901429655001201438IND60109415220221119032030.0141109e20110923xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010941522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2011.07.0552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Hui-Chang10aOzonolysis of bis-endo-diacylbicyclo[2.2.1]heptenes in dichloromethane–methanol  ap. 7236-7243.  aOzonolysis of bis-endo-diacylbicyclo[2.2.1]heptenes 3a–d at −78 °C in dichloromethane–methanol gave the hydroperoxides 6a–d in 70–80% yields.

Yet while the influences of food and beverage intake as just two of these variables on oral drug delivery have been extensively documented in the wider literature, specific information on their effects remains sporadic, and is not so much contextually reviewed. Food co-ingestion with oral dosage forms can mediate several changes to drug bioavailability, yet the precise mechanisms underlying this have yet to be fully elucidated. Likewise, the often detrimental effects of alcohol (ethanol) on dosage form performance have been widely observed experimentally, but knowledge of which has only moderately impacted on clinical practice. Here, we attempt to piece together the available subject matter relating to the influences of both solid and liquid foodstuffs on the gastrointestinal milieu and the implications for oral drug delivery, with particular emphasis on the behaviour of modified-release dosage forms, formulation robustness and drug absorption. Providing better insight into these influences, and exemplifying cases where formulations have been developed or modified to circumvent their associated problems, can help to appropriately direct the design of future in vitro digestive modelling systems as well as oral dosage forms resilient to these effects. Moreover, this will help to better our understanding of the impact of food and alcohol intake on normal gut behaviour and function.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalcohol drinking 3abeverages 3abioavailability 3adrug formulations 3adrugs 3aethanol 3agastrointestinal system 3amodels 3aoral administration 3apharmacokinetics1 aHatton, G.B.1 aBasit, A.W.0 tSensors and actuators.g2013 Dec. 5, v. 457, no. 2 p.446-460dElsevier B.V.x0378-51737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpharm.2013.04.0343Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02924naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245012800165300001400293520146900307592002801776650001901804650001901823650002701842650001101869650001701880650002501897650002201922650001301944650001501957650001601972650001601988650002802004650001102032650001502043650001602058650001602074650001302090650002102103650001302124650002202137650002202159650001502181700002102196700001902217773009202236856008102328852000902409655001202418IND60110357620221120032546.0141109e20111028xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011035762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tox.2011.07.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPonte, Filipa10aProtective effect of acetyl-l-carnitine and α-lipoic acid against the acute toxicity of diepoxybutane to human lymphocytes  ap. 52-58.  aThe biotransformation and oxidative stress may contribute to 1,2:3,4-diepoxybutane (DEB)-induced toxicity to human lymphocytes of Fanconi Anemia (FA) patients. Thus, the identification of putative inhibitors of bioactivation, as well as the determination of the protective role of oxidant defenses, on DEB-induced toxicity, can help to understand what is failing in FA cells. In the present work we studied the contribution of several biochemical pathways for DEB-induced acute toxicity in human lymphocyte suspensions, by using inhibitors of epoxide hydrolases, inhibitors of protective enzymes as glutathione S-transferase and catalase, the depletion of glutathione (GSH), and the inhibition of protein synthesis; and a variety of putative protective compounds, including antioxidants, and mitochondrial protective agents. The present study reports two novel findings: (i) it was clearly evidenced, for the first time, that the acute exposure of freshly isolated human lymphocytes to DEB results in severe GSH depletion and loss of ATP, followed by cell death; (ii) acetyl-l-carnitine elicits a significant protective effect on DEB induced toxicity, which was potentiated by α-lipoic acid.

Crystal structures of 1-CH₃, 1-NO₂, 2-OCH₃, 2-NO₂ and L-NO₂ have been determined. In all the complexes the thiosemicarbazones are coordinated to the metal center, via dissociation of the acidic proton, as bidentate N,S-donors forming five-membered chelate rings. With reference to the structure of the uncoordinated thiosemicarbazone, this coordination mode is associated with a conformational change around the CN bond. All the 1-R and 2-R complexes display intense absorptions in the visible region. Catalytic activity of the 1-R and 2-R complexes towards some C–C coupling reactions (e.g. Suzuki, Heck and Sonogashira) has been examined and while both are found to be efficient catalysts, 1-R is much better catalyst than 2-R.  aPublisher supplied data 3abenzaldehyde 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acrystal structure 3adissociation 3anitrogen dioxide 3apalladium1 aDatta, Sayanti1 aHalder, Sarmistha1 aAcharyya, Rama1 aBasuli, Falguni1 aButcher, Ray J.1 aPeng, Shie-Ming1 aLee, Gene-Hsiang1 aCastiñeiras, A.q(Alfonso),1 aDrew, Michael G.B.1 aBhattacharya, Samaresh0 tJournal of Molecular Catalysis.

However, this latter contention remains uncorroborated. We investigated whether ischemic hippocampal neuronal cell death induces glucose dysregualtion by modulating insulin resistance, glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, and β-cell mass in Mongolian gerbils fed either a high fat or low fat diet. MAIN METHODS: Gerbils were subjected to either an occlusion of the bilateral common carotid arteries for 8mins to render them ischemic, or a sham operation. Ischemic gerbils were fed either an 11% fat diet (LFD) or a 40% fat diet (HFD) for 7, 14 or 28days. KEY FINDINGS: Artery occlusion resulted in a 70% or greater initial reduction in hippocampal CA1 neurons and only HFD decreased the percentage of CA1 neurons as the ischemic periods became longer. Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) results revealed that ischemia induced glucose intolerance, and longer ischemic periods and HFD exacerbated this glucose intolerance in ischemic gerbils. Insulin secretion during the OGTT was lower in ischemic gerbils than sham gerbils and the decrease was greatest in the 28day-HFD among all the groups. Insulin resistance was elevated the most in 28day-HFD ischemic gerbils. There was a progressive loss of pancreatic β-cell mass as the post-ischemic time period increased as consequence of HFD; the decrease being caused by increased apoptosis. This increase in apoptosis was partly associated with increased serum levels of IL-1β, TNF-α and non-esterified fatty acids. SIGNIFICANCE: Hippoccampal neuronal cell death deteriorates glucose homeostasis initially through the modulation of insulin secretion and also causes a decrease in β-cell mass while HFD negatively impacts glucose regulation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3ablood serum 3acarotid arteries 3adiabetes 3afree fatty acids 3agerbils 3aglucose 3aglucose tolerance tests 3ahigh fat diet 3ahomeostasis 3ahyperglycemia 3ainsulin resistance 3ainsulin secretion 3ainterleukin-1beta 3aischemia 3aislets of Langerhans 3alow fat diet 3aneurons 3astroke 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha1 aKim, Da Sol1 aKang, Sunna1 aKwon, Dae Young0 tLife sciences.g2011 Apr. 25, v. 88, no. 17-18 p.766-773dElsevier Inc.x0024-32057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2011.02.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01746naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245011800166300001600284520065700300592002800957650002700985650002501012650002001037650001601057650001601073650001501089650001901104650002201123650001301145650002601158700001401184773010401198856008501302852000901387655001201396IND60101441720221122062136.0141106e20120330xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010144172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2012.01.0412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, J.Q.10aAccess the toxic effect of the antibiotic cefradine and its UV light degradation products on two freshwater algae  ap. 520-523.  aTwo common freshwater algae Microcystis aeruginosa and Scenedesmus obliquus were employed as test organism to evaluate the toxic effects of the widely used antibiotic, cefradine.

A decrease in absorption of the membrane at 664nm and/or increase at 555nm could be used as a suitable wavelength for quantitative determination of Hg(II). This membrane is capable of determining mercury(II) ions over a wide linear dynamic range 1.0×10⁻⁹ to 9.5×10⁻⁵molL⁻¹ Hg(II) at pH 7.0 with detection limits of 8.1×10⁻¹⁰molL⁻¹ Hg(II) and response time of 100s. The optode reveals a very good selectivity toward Hg(II) ions over a wide variety of other metal ions in solution and the response to Hg(II) is fully reversible. Performance characteristics of the sensor evaluated as good reversibility, wide dynamic range, long life span, long-term response stability, and high reproducibility. The optode was applied to the determination of mercury(II) in water samples. The accuracy of the results was comparable to those obtained by cold vapor atomic absorption spectrometry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aions 3amercury 3aoptics 3asensors (equipment)1 aMovahedi, Mohsen1 aEnsafi, Ali A.0 tSensors and actuators.g2012 , v. 171-172 p.492-498dElsevier B.V.x0925-40057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.snb.2012.05.0173Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01719naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245012000168300001600288520080400304592002801108650001801136650001401154650002801168650001601196700001701212773008401229856008401313990002301397852000901420655001201429IND60110908520221117224708.0141109e201108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011090852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ultras.2011.03.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Byungsoo10aSimple expressions of the reflection and transmission coefficients of fundamental lamb waves by a rectangular notch  ap. 734-744.  aThe scattering of Lamb waves by a two-dimensional rectangular notch is investigated for rapid inspection of defects in a structure.

Linear equations corresponding to the reflection and transmission coefficients are constructed along with scattering graphs. For an illustration of the efficacy of the presented method, the scattering of fundamental symmetric and anti-symmetric modes are inspected according to the depth and width of a notch in a plate.

Two-terminal devices were fabricated using standard microfabrication techniques with the individual NWs air-bridged between the two metal contact pads. Through a combination of X-ray diffraction (XRD), electron-backscatter-diffraction (EBSD), and TEM/STEM techniques, we confirmed the presence of rutile SnO₂ nanocrystals on the GaN surface. A change in device current is observed when the device is exposed to alcohol vapors (methanol, ethanol, propanol, and butanol) at room temperature under 215–400nm UV illumination with 3.75mW/m² intensity at 365nm wavelength. The sensor reproducibly responded to a wide range of alcohol vapor concentrations, from 5000μmol/mol (ppm) down to 1μmol/mol (ppm) in air. Notably, the devices show low sensitivity to acetone and hexane, which allows them to selectively detect the primary alcohol vapors mixed with these two common volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The sensor response was not observed without UV excitation. From the experimental results we found a relationship between the response towards the alcohol vapors and the length of carbon chain in the molecule: the chemiresistive response decreases with the increasing carbon chain from methanol to n-butanol. In addition, we observed that the isomeric branching in i-propanol and i-butanol caused reduced response as compared to n-propanol and n-butanol, respectively. We have qualitatively explained the sensor operation by employing a mechanism, which includes oxidation of analyte molecules on the SnO₂ surface, leading to enhanced photoconductivity in GaN nanowire.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aacetone 3aethanol 3agallium 3ahexane 3amethanol 3ananomaterials 3asensors (equipment) 3atemperature 3atin 3atransmission electron microscopy 3aultraviolet radiation1 aMotayed, Abhishek1 aDavydov, Albert V.1 aOleshko, Vladimir P.1 aAluri, Geetha S.1 aBertness, Kristine Ann,1 aRao, Mulpuri V.1 aZaghloul, Mona E.0 tSensors and actuators.g2012 , v. 171-172 p.499-507dElsevier B.V.x0925-40057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.snb.2012.05.0183Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02653naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245008800167300001400255520149300269592002801762650001201790650001701802650001001819650001201829650001101841650001301852650001301865650001101878650001901889650001501908653001101923653001601934653001801950653001701968653002001985653001902005700001602024773009902040856008302139852000902222655001202231IND60111692420221120110507.0190411e201307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011169242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.actao.2013.04.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPakeman, R.J.10aUsing plant functional traits as a link between land use and bee foraging abundance  ap. 32-39.  aMany recent studies have shown that plant functional traits can be used to predict the response of plant assemblages to management or other environmental change. A further challenge is to use them to predict changes in the assemblages of other groups. Using data from a study of the impact of land use on biodiversity, the linkages between management drivers, a range of plant functional traits and the overall foraging numbers and assemblage of bees was assessed. Bee foraging numbers were only weakly predicted by plant traits, though bee foraging assemblage was closely related to a number of different groups of plant traits (flower colour and Forage Index, as well as taxonomic group). In turn, the selected traits were significantly correlated to some of the response traits that linked the plant assemblage to management, indicating that there was a predictive pathway from management to bee abundance and assemblage structure. However, models developed with just the environmental drivers proved superior at predicting both bee numbers and assemblage. Plant traits proved to be a moderately effective predictor of bee assemblage structure. However, the use of plant traits as a link between the bees and management did not offer any improvement on models directly developed from management variables. This suggests that the bee assemblage is responding to traits that have not been quantified and that developing these trophic linkage models may have to take a different approach.  aPublisher supplied data 3aApoidea 3abiodiversity 3acolor 3aflowers 3aforage 3aforaging 3aland use 3amodels 3aplant response 3aprediction 0aBombus 0aDisturbance 0aEffect traits 0aProductivity 0aResponse traits 0aTrait linkages1 aStockan, J.0 tActa oecologica.g2013 July, v. 50 p.32-39dElsevier Masson SASwJournal:2127x1146-609X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actao.2013.04.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02547naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245013500170300001600305520115100321592002801472650001201500650002101512650001401533650001801547650001701565650000901582650001901591650001101610650001901621650001501640650001901655650001601674650001001690650001101700650001001711650001401721650001601735650002601751650001501777700001601792700001301808700001801821700001601839773010401855856008501959852000902044655001202053IND60101441820221122070030.0141106e20120330xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010144182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2012.01.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yao Jun12aA new alkali-activated steel slag-based cementitious material for photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutant from waste water  ap. 146-150.  aA new type of Ni,Ca-cementitious material was firstly synthesized via a two-step reaction of alkali-activated steel slag polymerization and ion exchange. The XRF results showed that almost all the Na⁺ ions in the matrix of Na,Ca-cementitious material were replaced by Ni²⁺ ions at room temperature. The new hydrated products of metahalloysite (Si₂Al₂O₅(OH)₄) and calcium silicate hydrate (CSH) were formed in the Na,Ca-cementitious material. The diffuse reflectance UV–vis near infrared ray spectrum was blue-shifted due to the strong interaction between Ni²⁺ and negative charge of [AlO₄]⁵⁻ tetrahedron in the framework of cementitious material. The Ni,Ca-cementitious material was used as a catalyst for the photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue dye and showed a degradation rate of 94.39% under UV irradiation. The high photocatalytic degradation activity was suggested to be the synergistic effect of the cementitious matrix, Ni²⁺ ions and the iron oxides of wustite (FeO) and calcium iron oxide (Ca₂Fe₂O₅) from the steel slag. A probable mechanism of photocatalytic oxidative degradation was proposed.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcium 3acalcium silicate 3acatalysts 3aferrous oxide 3aion exchange 3aions 3amethylene blue 3anickel 3aphotocatalysis 3apollutants 3apolymerization 3areflectance 3aslags 3asodium 3asteel 3asynergism 3atemperature 3aultraviolet radiation 3awastewater1 aLiu, Li Cai1 aXu, Yong1 aWang, Ya Chao1 aXu, De Long0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2012 Mar. 30, v. 209-210 p.146-150dElsevier B.V.x0304-38947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2012.01.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02702naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245006700170300001400237520134600251592002801597650002001625650001301645650001001658650001701668650001601685650001501701650001501716650001201731650001701743650001401760650002301774650000901797650001501806650001301821650001701834700002101851700002601872700002001898700002901918700002301947700002001970773011601990856008202106990002302188852000902211655001202220IND60102946220221119041245.0141106e20120325xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010294622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jpba.2012.01.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarbonara, Teresa10aPhytochemical analysis of a herbal tea from Artemisia annua L.  ap. 79-86.  aStrategies to control diffusion of malaria needs to account for the increase of resistance of the parasite to the conventional antimalarial drugs. It has been proposed that a traditional aqueous preparation from Artemisia annua, with a low content of the active compound, artemisinin, may reduce the risk of resistance of the protozoa and be relatively more effective in the treatment of the disease. The solubility properties of the molecule have been the matter of concern about the therapeutic usefulness of herbal teas from A. annua. The present study aimed at analysing the chemical profile of a tea infusion from A. annua. Tea from A. annua was prepared through infusion of the plant aerial parts in water for 1, 24 and 48h. Content of artemisinin was determined by HPLC-ELSD. Overall chemical characterization of the extracts was carried out by a combination of metabolomic techniques. The artemisinin content varied only slightly in the three different extracts (about 0.12%). A series of mono-caffeoyl- and mono-feruloyl-quinic acids, di-caffeoyl- and di-feruloyl-quinic acids was identified as main components of the tea infusion, together with some flavonoids. Reconstitution of the same extracts in less polar or apolar solvents resulted in a different composition with no phenolics and a much lower concentration of artemisinin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArtemisia annua 3aProtozoa 3aacids 3aaerial parts 3aartemisinin 3aflavonoids 3aherbal tea 3amalaria 3ametabolomics 3aparasites 3aphenolic compounds 3arisk 3asolubility 3asolvents 3atherapeutics1 aPascale, Rossana1 aArgentieri, Maria Pia1 aPapadia, Paride1 aFanizzi, Francesco Paolo1 aVillanova, Luciano1 aAvato, Pinarosa0 tJournal of pharmaceutical and biomedical analysis.g2012 Mar. 25, v. 62 p.79-86dElsevier B.V.x0731-70857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpba.2012.01.0153Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03102naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245014800169300001600317520193200333592002802265650001402293650001602307650001402323650001802337650002302355650001402378650001102392650001302403650002102416650001702437650002202454650000902476650003202485700001602517773009302533856008102626852000902707655001202716IND60103484020221120071357.0141106e20110425xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010348402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lfs.2011.02.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKalonia, Harikesh10aSuppressing inflammatory cascade by cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors attenuates quinolinic acid induced Huntington's disease-like alterations in rats  ap. 784-791.  aAIMS: The aim of this study was to investigate the protective effects of cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors against quinolinic acid (QA) induced Huntington's disease-like alterations in rats. MAIN METHODS: Quinolinic acid (300nmol) was administered intrastriatally into the striatum to induce Huntington's disease-like alteration. Cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors celecoxib (15 and 30mg/kg) and meloxicam (10 and 20mg/kg) were given for 21days. In behavioral assessment locomotor, rotarod, and balance beam walk performances were assessed. Oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, proinflammatory cytokines and caspase-3 were assessed on day 21 after behavioral assessments. KEY FINDINGS: Intrastriatal quinolinic acid (300nmol) administration significantly altered the body weight, motor coordination, and induced oxidative damage (as indicated by the increase in lipid peroxidation and nitrite concentration) in the striatum as compared to sham group. Besides quinolinic acid (300nmol) significantly depleted the mitochondrial enzyme complex levels and increased TNF-α, IL-6 and caspase-3 (marker of apoptotic cell death) levels in the striatum. Chronic treatment with celecoxib (15 and 30mg/kg) significantly attenuated the quinolinic acid-induced behavioral and biochemical alterations, while meloxicam was able to reverse behavioral alterations at higher dose (20mg/kg) as compared to the quinolinic acid treated group. Chronic treatment with the selective COX-2 inhibitors significantly restored the mitochondrial enzyme complex activities as well as attenuated TNF-α, IL-6 and caspase-3 levels as compared to the quinolinic acid treated group. SIGNIFICANCE: Results of the present study demonstrate the protective effect of cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors in the experimental models of Huntington's disease; and further provide evidence toward the involvement of neuroinflammatory cascade in the pathogenesis of Huntington's disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3abody weight 3acaspase-3 3ainterleukin-6 3alipid peroxidation 3ameloxicam 3amodels 3anitrites 3aoxidative stress 3apathogenesis 3aprotective effect 3arats 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha1 aAnil Kumar,0 tLife sciences.g2011 Apr. 25, v. 88, no. 17-18 p.784-791dElsevier Inc.x0024-32057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2011.02.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02640naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001400152245010700166300001600273520155400289592002801843650000801871650002101879650002001900650001601920650000901936650001001945650002401955650002101979650001202000650001602012700001502028700001402043700001602057773009802073856008602171852000902257655001202266IND60107504220221118223930.0141108e201108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010750422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jtherbio.2011.06.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYahav, S.10aDiurnally cycling temperature and ventilation affect young turkeys' performance and sensible heat loss  ap. 334-339.  aThe goals were to elucidate the effects of ventilation rate (VR) coupled with exposure to constant 20°C or to diurnal temperature cycling on young turkeys' performance and sensible heat loss (SHL). In three experiments male British United Turkeys (BUT), from 3 to 6 weeks of age, were exposed to constant 20°C, or to 35/25°C or 30/20°C diurnal temperature cycling, all at 50% RH and with VR (expressed as air velocity (AV)) ranging from 0.8 to 3.0ms⁻¹. The 2nd and 3rd of these experiments included a positive control at constant 30°C and VR of 1.5ms⁻¹. Weight gain, feed intake, and feed efficiency were measured or calculated, as appropriate; SHL was calculated from measured surface temperature, and plasma concentrations of triiodothyronine (T₃) was determined in the 1st experiment. Changes of VR at constant 20°C did not affect performance, but total SHL increased significantly with increasing VR. Under the 35/25°C regime a significantly higher BW was recorded, with a similar pattern of feed efficiency, when VR during the hot part of the cycle was 1.5 or 2.0ms⁻¹ than when it was 0.8ms⁻¹. In the 3rd experiment, BW in the 35/20°C treatment was significantly lower than that of the controls. In all experiments, turkeys maintained body temperature (Tb) within the normothermic range, and SHL varied with VR. It can be concluded that although diurnal temperature cycling reflects the natural situation, exposing young turkeys to constant 30°C combined with optimal ventilation might yield the best performance results.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3abody temperature 3afeed conversion 3afeed intake 3aheat 3amales 3asurface temperature 3atriiodothyronine 3aturkeys 3aweight gain1 aDruyan, S.1 aRusal, M.1 aShinder, D.0 tJournal of thermal biology.g2011 Aug., v. 36, no. 6 p.334-339dElsevier Ltdx0306-45657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jtherbio.2011.06.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01302naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245010000170300001600270520027800286592002800564650001300592650002200605650001100627650002200638650002400660700001800684700002100702700002100723700001900744773008800763856008100851990002300932852000900955655001200964IND60108791320221118001250.0141108e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010879132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.snb.2013.07.0432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVoznesenskiy, S.S.10aIntegrated-optical sensors based on chitosan waveguide films for relative humidity measurements  ap. 482-487.  aHere we report on fabrication and properties of integrated-optical sensors for relative humidity detection based on waveguide films of chitosan in neutral and salt forms.

Theoretical analysis showed that the key to obtain the non-zero order drug release was to break the balance between the drug suspension release rate in the drug layer and the swelling rate of the core, and an ascending drug release rate was achieved when the former was slower than the latter. A polymer (Polyox WSR N-12K) was introduced as a suspension agent in drug layer to slow down the hydration rate of drug layer. Influence of the composition of drug layer (PEO category, total amount, drug loading and fraction of NaCl), push layer (NaCl amount), and also the level of coating weight gain on the drug release profiles was investigated. Observation of hydration state was estimated by taking photos, and also was confirmed by the theories. Paliperidone was delivered successfully by APOP at an ascending release rate up to 20h in vitro. The in vivo plasma concentration of paliperidone in beagle dogs increased gradually up to 19h. The APOP with an easy manufacture process was a promising strategy to deliver drug at an ascending rate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBeagle 3adogs 3adrugs 3amanufacturing 3apharmacokinetics 3apolymers 3asodium chloride 3aweight gain1 aLi, Zhao1 aPan, Hao1 aZhang, Zhihong1 aLiu, Dandan1 aTian, Baocheng1 aMa, Shilin1 aSong, Shilong1 aPan, Weisan0 tSensors and actuators.g2013 Dec. 15, v. 458, no. 1 p.181-187dElsevier B.V.x0378-51737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpharm.2013.09.0313Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01861naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245011100172300001600283520098100299592002801280650001601308650001401324650002701338700001801365773008401383856008401467990002301551852000901574655001201583IND60110908720221117224530.0141109e201108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011090872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ultras.2011.03.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeclercq, Nico F.12aA feasibility study of the use of bounded beams resembling the shape of evanescent and inhomogeneous waves  ap. 752-757.  aPlane waves are solutions of the visco-elastic wave equation. Their wave vector can be real for homogeneous plane waves or complex for inhomogeneous and evanescent plane waves. Although interesting from a theoretical point of view, complex wave vectors normally only emerge naturally when propagation or scattering is studied of sound under the appearance of damping effects. Because of the particular behavior of inhomogeneous and evanescent waves and their estimated efficiency for surface wave generation, bounded beams, experimentally mimicking their infinite counterparts similar to (wide) Gaussian beams imitating infinite harmonic plane waves, are of special interest in this report. The study describes the behavior of bounded inhomogeneous and bounded evanescent waves in terms of amplitude and phase distribution as well as energy flow direction. The outcome is of importance to the applicability of bounded inhomogeneous ultrasonic waves for nondestructive testing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy flow 3aequations 3anondestructive methods1 aLeroy, Oswald0 tUltrasonics.g2011 Aug., v. 51, no. 6 p.752-757dElsevier B.V.x0041-624X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ultras.2011.03.0033Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02038naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245009600169300001800265520092100283592002801204650001501232650002301247650001501270650001201285650001301297650001301310650002401323650002401347650001501371650001301386650001101399650001401410700001901424700002001443773009601463856008401559852000901643655001201652IND60109964520221121044050.0141109e20120801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010996452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2012.05.0742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Chih-Hau10aMicrowave-assisted synthesis of highly functionalized guanidines on soluble polymer support  ap. 3959-3962.  aAn efficient method for the N,N′-di(Boc)-protected guanidines containing piperazine and homopiperazine scaffolds has been developed under multi-step microwave irradiation. Followed by alkylation of carbamate-protected guanidines with various alkyl halides is also explored. This protocol proceeds via deprotonation of the acidic N-carbamate hydrogen of the guanidine by sodium hydride on soluble polymer support. In this manner, highly functionalized guanidines were obtained after cleavage from the support. The reaction is tolerant of a wide range of functional groups on both the alkyl halide and guanidine components. In addition, the reaction is sufficiently simple workup by precipitation in each step to yield the substituted guanidines in high purity. In conjunction with microwave irradiation and soluble polymer support, this method provides an efficient route to access highly functionalized guanidines.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkylation 3achemical structure 3aguanidines 3ahalides 3ahydrides 3ahydrogen 3amicrowave radiation 3amicrowave treatment 3apiperazine 3apolymers 3asodium 3asynthesis1 aTung, Chieh-Li1 aSun, Zhongming,0 tTetrahedron letters.g2012 Aug. 1, v. 53, no. 31 p.3959-3962dElsevier Ltdx0040-40397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tetlet.2012.05.0743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02145naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002700150245009400177300001600271520120800287592002801495650002001523650001101543650001801554650001701572700001701589700002501606700002501631773009401656856008401750852000901834655001201843IND60105954120221120034457.0141108e20110725xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010595412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.powtec.2011.04.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSiraj, Muhammad Shafiq10aEffect of blade angle and particle size on powder mixing performance in a rectangular box  ap. 100-113.  aThis study focuses on the understanding of flow over a single blade and its impact on powder mixing. The Discrete or Distinct Element Method (DEM) is used and the flow of a single blade through a bed of a binary particle mixture is studied. Mixing performance with respect to a blade-rake angle and particle size is investigated using the Modified Generalized Mean Mixing Index (MGMMI) and the maximum mean instantaneous velocities. A wide range of angles and different loading scenarios of the binary particle mixture were studied. Velocity profiles for all these cases were computed, as well as the forces on particles and the blade. The results showed an inverse relation between the interparticle force and blade-rake angle. Systems with a higher number of larger particles experienced a higher interparticle force. Similar results were obtained for the blade force. The results for mixing efficiency showed that if the smaller particles are placed at the top this leads to a higher mixing performance. The mixing performance was highest for blade-rake angles that offered a maximal surface area or maximal resistance to the flow of particles, which occurred for blade-rake angles from 70° to 90°.  aPublisher supplied data 3aflow resistance 3amixing 3aparticle size 3asurface area1 aRadl, Stefan1 aGlasser, Benjamin J.1 aKhinast, Johannes G.0 tPowder technology.g2011 July 25, v. 211, no. 1 p.100-113dElsevier B.V.x0032-59107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2011.04.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03487naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245011600164300001400280520198000294592002802274650000802302650002002310650002102330650001402351650001102365650002002376650001602396650001602412650001302428650002302441650002002464650001802484650002302502650001302525650002102538650000902559650001102568650005202579650001502631650002002646650001102666650001502677700002402692700001702716700002202733700001802755773009402773856008102867852000902948655001202957IND60110358020221117182431.0141109e20111118xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011035802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tox.2011.07.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDoshi, Tanvi10aHypermethylation of estrogen receptor promoter region in adult testis of rats exposed neonatally to bisphenol A  ap. 74-82.  aBACKGROUND: Bisphenol A (BPA) is an estrogenic endocrine disruptor commonly used in manufacture of polycarbonate plastics and epoxy resins. Due to its ubiquitous presence in the environment, health concerns are increasing. Earlier studies from our group have shown that neonatal exposure of male rats to BPA affected spermatogenesis leading to impairment in fertility during adulthood. Further we also observed an altered gene expression of ERα and ERβ in adult testis upon BPA exposure. Based on these results, we hypothesized that apart from endocrine action, BPA might mediate perturbations in expression of ERs via epigenetic mechanism. OBJECTIVES: The present study was undertaken to determine the effect of exposure of neonatal male rats to BPA on DNA methylation profile of estrogen receptor promoter region and on DNA methylation machinery. METHODS: In order to test this hypothesis, neonatal male rats were subcutaneously injected with 2.4μg of BPA/day for the first five days of life, i.e., on postnatal days (PND) 1–5, while control group received vehicle (sesame oil). Animals were sacrificed during adulthood (PND-125) and testes were dissected out for analysis. Methylation pattern of promoter region of ERα and ERβ was analyzed in the testis by bisulfite sequencing and expression levels of DNA methyltransferases by quantitative RT-PCR and Western blotting respectively. RESULTS: Bisulfite sequencing revealed significant hypermethylation of ERα promoter to varying extents from 40% to 60%, and ERβ promoter region with varying extent from 20% to 65%. Approximately 2-fold increase in Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b expression at transcript and protein level was also observed. CONCLUSION: The experimental evidence demonstrated that the neonatal exposure of rats to BPA led to aberrant DNA methylation in testis, indicating methylation mediated epigenetic changes as one of the possible mechanisms of BPA induced adverse effects on spermatogenesis and fertility.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDNA methylation 3aWestern blotting 3aadulthood 3aadults 3aadverse effects 3abisphenol A 3aepigenetics 3aepoxides 3aestrogen receptors 3agene expression 3amanufacturing 3amethyltransferases 3aplastics 3apromoter regions 3arats 3aresins 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asesame oil 3aspermatogenesis 3atestes 3atoxicology1 aMehta, Smita Salian1 aDighe, Vikas1 aBalasinor, Nafisa1 aVanage, Geeta0 tToxicology.g2011 Nov. 18, v. 289, no. 2-3 p.74-82dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0300-483X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tox.2011.07.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01930naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245008900170300001600259520072000275592002800995650001601023650002201039650001701061650001701078650002301095650001601118650000901134650001501143650001501158650001801173650001801191650002401209650003701233700002301270700002501293773008601318856008401404990002301488852000901511655001201520IND60104032220221117233401.0141107e20131001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010403222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.matlet.2013.07.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTamuly, Chandan10aBiosynthesis of Au nanoparticles by Gymnocladus assamicus and its catalytic activity  ap. 276-279.  aHere we first report synthesis of gold (Au) nanoparticles by using Gymnocladus assamicus pod extract in aqueous medium.

Such transitions place unique metabolic demands on the differentiating cells. T cells meet these demands by altering their metabolic profiles, which are, in turn, regulated by distinct signaling cascades and transcriptional programs. Here, we examine the metabolic profiles of T cells during an acute immune response and discuss the signal and transcriptional regulators of these metabolic changes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aT-lymphocytes 3aimmune response 3ametabolism 3apathogens 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors1 aWang, Ruoning1 aGreen, Douglas R.0 tSeminars in immunology.g2012 Dec., v. 24, no. 6 p.399-404dElsevier Ltdx1044-53237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.smim.2012.12.0063Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03106naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245010400173300001600277520167800293592002801971650001901999650002202018650002502040650002502065650002202090650002302112650002202135650001202157650000902169650001802178650001202196650004402208650001502252650001302267650002402280650002002304700001902324700002802343700002202371700002402393773010102417856008602518990002302604852000902627655001202636IND60102452320221120121659.0141106e20130327xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010245232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molstruc.2012.12.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBruno, Flavia P.10aCharacterization and structural analysis of the potent antiparasitic and antiviral agent tizoxanide  ap. 318-325.  aTizoxanide [2-(hydroxy)-N-(5-nitro-2-thiazolyl)benzamide, TIZ] is a new potent anti-infective agent which may enhance current therapies for leishmaniasis, Chagas disease and viral hepatitis. The aim of this study was to identify the conformational preferences that may be related to the biological activity of TIZ by resolving its crystal structure and characterizing various physicochemical properties, including its experimental vibrational and ¹³C nuclear magnetic resonance properties, behavior on heating and solubility in several solvents at 25°C. TIZ crystallizes from dimethylformamide as the carboxamide tautomer in the triclinic system, space group P(−1) (No. 2) with the following unit cell parameters at 173(2)K: a=5.4110(3)Å, b=7.3315(6)Å, c=13.5293(9)Å, α=97.528(3), β=95.390(4), γ=97.316(5), V=524.41(6)Å³, Z=2, Dc=1.680g/cm³, R₁=0.0482 and wR₂=0.0911 for 2374 reflections. This modification of TIZ has a ‘graphitic’ structure and is composed of tightly packed layers of extensively hydrogen-bonded molecules. The various spectroscopic data [Diffuse Fourier transform infrared (DRIFT) and FT-Raman, recorded in the range 3600–500 and 4000–200cm⁻¹ respectively, and solid-state ¹³C NMR] were consistent with the structure determined by X-ray crystallography. From DSC, TG and thermomicroscopy, it was concluded that TIZ is thermally stable as a solid and that melting is not an isolated event from the one-step thermal decomposition that it undergoes above 270°C. This modification of TIZ is practically insoluble in water and slightly soluble in polar aprotic solvents such as dimethylsulfoxide, dimethylformamide and dioxane.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChagas disease 3aX-ray diffraction 3aantiparasitic agents 3abioactive properties 3acrystal structure 3adimethyl sulfoxide 3adimethylformamide 3adioxane 3aheat 3aleishmaniasis 3amelting 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3asolubility 3asolvents 3athermal degradation 3aviral hepatitis1 aCaira, Mino R.1 aMartin, Eliseo Ceballos1 aMonti, Gustavo A.1 aSperandeo, Norma R.0 tJournal of molecular structure.g2013 Mar. 27, v. 1036 p.318-325dElsevier B.V.x0022-28607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molstruc.2012.12.0043Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02729naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001900152245017400171300001600345520152600361592002801887650002601915650001401941650001001955650001101965650001801976650001001994650001002004650002202014650001602036650002602052650001702078650001302095651000902108700001602117700001802133773011602151856005502267852000902322655001202331IND4501283420221117230624.0150424e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND450128342DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2672.2011.05102.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWilliams, M.L.10aMultipleâlocus variableânucleotide tandem repeat subtype analysis implicates European starlings as biological vectors for Escherichia coli O157:H7 in Ohio, USA  ap. 982-988.  aAims: To provide molecular epidemiological evidence of avian transmission of Escherichia coli O157:H7 between dairy farms in Ohio, this study was designed to identify genetic relatedness between isolates originating from bovine faecal samples and intestinal contents of European starlings captured on these farms. Methods and Results: During a threeâyear period (2007â2009), cattle (nâ= 9000) and starlings (nâ=â430) on 150 different dairy farms in northern Ohio were sampled for the presence of E.Â coli O157:H7. Isolates were subjected to multipleâlocus variableânucleotide tandem repeat analysis (MLVA). Distinct allelic groups were identified on most farms; however, isolates clustering into three MLVA groups originated from both cattle and birds on different farms. Conclusions: Sharing of indistinguishable epidemiologically linked E.Â coli O157 MLVA subtypes between starlings and cattle on different farms supports the hypothesis that these birds contribute to the transmission of E.Â coli O157:H7 between dairy farms. Significance and Impact of Study: A continued need exists to identify and to improve preharvest measures for controlling E.Â coli O157:H7. Controlling wildlife intrusion, particularly European starlings, on livestock operations, may be an important strategy for reducing dissemination of E.Â coli O157:H7 between farms and thereby potentially decreasing the onâfarm prevalence of E.Â coli O157:H7 and enhancing the safety of the food supply.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli O157 3aSturnidae 3abirds 3acattle 3adairy farming 3afarms 3afeces 3afood availability 3afood safety 3agenetic relationships 3amicrobiology 3awildlife 3aOhio1 aPearl, D.L.1 aLeJeune, J.T.0 tJournal of applied microbiology.g2011 Oct., v. 111, no. 4 p.982-988dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1364-50727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2672.2011.05102.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02035naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245009200168300001600260520105900276592002801335650004401363650001101407650004401418700001701462700001801479700001701497773010101514856008601615990002301701852000901724655001201733IND60102452420221120121743.0141106e20130327xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010245242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molstruc.2012.12.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArjunan, V.10aVibrational, electronic and quantum chemical studies of 5-benzimidazole carboxylic acid  ap. 326-340.  aDetailed structural and vibrational investigations of 5-benzimidazole carboxylic acid have been carried out with FTIR and FT-Raman spectral techniques. The electronic structure of the molecule has been analysed by ¹H and ¹³C NMR spectroscopies. The DFT studies were carried out with B3LYP method utilising 6-31G**, 6-311++G** and cc-pVTZ basis sets to determine the structural, thermodynamical, vibrational, electronic characteristics of the compound and also to understand the electronic and steric influence of the carboxylic group on the skeletal frequencies. Complete NBO analysis was also carried out to find out the intramolecular electronic interactions and their stabilisation energy. The extreme limits of the electrostatic potential is +1.435e×10⁻² and −1.435e×10⁻². The frontier orbital energy gap in the case of 5BICA is found to be 5.2742eV.

We utilize consumers’ stated preference weights to obtain hospital-specific estimates of perceptions about unmeasured attributes such as reputation. We report three findings. First, consumers’ perceptions of reputation and medical services contribute substantially to utility for a hospital choice. Second, consumers tend to select hospitals with high clinical quality scores even before the scores are publicized. However, the effect of clinical quality on hospital choice is relatively small. Third, satisfaction with a prior hospital admission has a large impact on future hospital choice. Our findings suggest that including measures of consumers’ experience in report cards may increase their responsiveness to publicized information, but other strategies are needed to overcome the large effects of consumers’ beliefs about other quality attributes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconsumer attitudes 3ahealth services 3ahospitals1 aFeldman, Roger1 aScanlon, Dennis0 tJournal of health economics.g2011 July, v. 30, no. 4 p.832-841dElsevier B.V.x0167-62967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhealeco.2011.05.0063Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02979naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003600113040001800149100002000167245012600187300001600313520158800329592002801917650002401945650002701969650001601996650001402012650002802026650001102054650002102065650001802086650001802104650001902122650001702141650001402158650001102172650001202183650001502195650001602210700002002226700001702246700002102263700001702284773011702301856008202418852000902500655001202509IND60100644620221120164855.0141105e20110115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010064462DNAL7 a209508182pmid7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2009.11.0682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOh, Hyeong Geun10aControl of molecular weight of polystyrene using the reverse iodine transfer polymerization (RITP) – Emulsion technique  ap. 459-466.  aThe RITP–emulsion polymerization of styrene in the presence of molecular iodine has been successfully performed using potassium persulfate (KPS) as an initiator and 1-hexadecanesulfonate as an emulsifier under argon atmosphere at 80°C for 7hrs in the absence of light. The effects of the iodine concentration, molar ratio between KPS and iodine, and solid contents on the molecular weight of polystyrene (PS) were studied. As the iodine concentration increased from 0.05 to 0.504mmol under the fixed [KPS]/[I₂] ratio at 4.5, the weight-average molecular weight of PS substantially decreased from 126,120 to 35,690g/mol, the conversion increased from 85.0% to 95.2%, and the weight-average particle diameter decreased from 159 to 103nm. In addition, as the ratio of [KPS]/[I₂] increased from 0.5 to 6.0 at the fixed [I₂] of 0.504mmol, the weight-average molecular weight of PS decreased from 72,170 to 30,640g/mol with high conversion between 81.7% and 96.5%. Moreover, when the styrene solid content increased from 10 to 40wt.% at the fixed [KPS]/[I₂] ratio of 4.5, the weight-average molecular weight of PS varied between 33,500 and 37,200g/mol, the conversion varied between 94.9% and 89.7% and the weight-average diameter varied from 122 to 205nm. Thus, the control of molecular weight of PS less than 100,000g/mol with high conversion (95%) and particle stability of up to 40wt.% solid content were easily achieved through the usage of iodine with suitable ratio of [KPS]/[I₂] in the RITP–emulsion polymerization technique, which is of great industrial importance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aargon (noble gases) 3achemical concentration 3aemulsifiers 3aemulsions 3aindustrial applications 3aiodine 3amolecular weight 3ananoparticles 3aparticle size 3apolymerization 3apolystyrenes 3apotassium 3asolids 3astyrene 3asulfonates 3atemperature1 aShin, Hongcheol1 aJung, Hyejun1 aLee, Byung Hyung1 aChoe, Soonja0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2011 Jan. 15, v. 353, no. 2 p.459-466dElsevier Inc.x0021-97977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2009.11.0683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01626naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245014900164300001600313520047400329592002800803650002100831650001300852650001100865650000900876650001900885650001300904650001400917650003300931700001500964700001300979700001400992700001601006700001501022773009001037856008101127990002301208852000901231655001201240IND60108710520221122004518.0141108e20130301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010871052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.snb.2012.12.0682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Suling10aImmobilization of gold nanoparticles on multi-wall carbon nanotubes as an enhanced material for selective voltammetric determination of dopamine  ap. 217-221.  aA novel and simple procedure is designed to prepare well-dispersed Au nanoparticles on multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWNTs).

STUDY DESIGN: This was a prospective, longitudinal, community-based study, which followed mother-infant dyads (n = 1070; representative of race, education, and income status of Memphis/Shelby County, Tennessee) from midgestation into early childhood. Child SE development was measured using the Brief Infant-Toddler Social and Emotional Assessment in all 1097 1-year-olds. Chronic stress was assessed by hair cortisol in a subsample of 1-year-olds (n = 297). Multivariate regression models were developed to predict SE problems and hair cortisol levels. RESULTS: More black mothers than white mothers reported SE problems in their 1-year-olds (32.9% vs 10.2%; P < .001). In multivariate regression, SE problems in blacks were predicted by lower maternal education, greater parenting stress and maternal psychological distress, and higher cyclothymic personality score. In whites, predictors of SE problems were Medicaid insurance, higher maternal depression score at 1 year, greater parenting stress and maternal psychological distress, higher dysthymic personality score, and male sex. SE problem scores were associated with higher hair cortisol levels (P = .01). Blacks had higher hair cortisol levels than whites (P < .001). In the entire subsample, increased hair cortisol levels were associated with higher parenting stress (P = .001), lower maternal depression score (P = .01), lower birth length (P < .001), and greater length at 1 year of age (P = .003). CONCLUSION: Differences in maternal education, insurance, mental health, and early stress may disrupt SE development in children. Complex relationships between hair cortisol level in 1-year-olds and maternal parenting stress and depression symptoms suggest dysregulation of the child's hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBlacks 3aWhites 3achildhood 3achildren 3acortisol 3adistress 3aeducation 3aincome 3ainsurance 3amental depression 3amental health 3amothers 3aparenting 3aregression analysis 2aAge Factors 2aChild Development 2aEmotions 2aFemale 2aHairxchemistry 2aHumans 2aHydrocortisonexanalysis 2aInfant 2aMale 2aProspective Studies 2aRisk Factors 2aSocioeconomic Factors 2aStress, Psychologicalxepidemiology 2aUrban Health 3aTennessee1 aAnand, Kanwaljeet J.S.1 aGraff, J.

We describe steps for the preparation of short DNA fragments for deep sequencing and MatLab software for the analysis of the results. Screening of peptide libraries displayed on the surface of bacteriophage (phage display) can be used to discover peptides that bind to any target. The key step in this discovery is the analysis of peptide sequences present in the library. This analysis is usually performed by Sanger sequencing, which is labor intensive and limited to examination of a few hundred phage clones. On the other hand, Illumina deep-sequencing technology can characterize over 10⁷ reads in a single run. We applied Illumina sequencing to analyze phage libraries. Using PCR, we isolated the variable regions from M13KE phage vectors from a phage display library. The PCR primers contained (i) sequences flanking the variable region, (ii) barcodes, and (iii) variable 5′-terminal region. We used this approach to examine how diversity of peptides in phage display libraries changes as a result of amplification of libraries in bacteria. Using HiSeq single-end Illumina sequencing of these fragments, we acquired over 2×10⁷ reads, 57 base pairs (bp) in length. Each read contained information about the barcode (6bp), one complimentary region (12bp) and a variable region (36bp). We applied this sequencing to a model library of 10⁶ unique clones and observed that amplification enriches ∼150 clones, which dominate ∼20% of the library. Deep sequencing, for the first time, characterized the collapse of diversity in phage libraries. The results suggest that screens based on repeated amplification and small-scale sequencing identify a few binding clones and miss thousands of useful clones. The deep sequencing approach described here could identify under-represented clones in phage screens. It could also be instrumental in developing new screening strategies, which can preserve diversity of phage clones and identify ligands previously lost in phage display screens.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDNA primers 3abacteria 3abacteriophages 3abarcoding 3aclones 3acomputer software 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3alabor 3aligands 3apeptide libraries 3aphage vectors 3apolymerase chain reaction 3ascreening1 aChu, Kiki1 aJin, Bingjie1 aLee, Sam W.1 aWhitesides, G.

Using such information, recombinations can be mapped onto chromosomes, compared with the segregation of a disease of interest and used to filter genome sequence variants. We now show that relatively inexpensive SNP array data from small pedigrees can be used in a similar manner to provide a means of identifying regions of interest in exome sequencing projects. We demonstrate that in those situations where one can assume complete penetrance and parental DNA is available, SNP recombination mapping using Boolean logic identifies chromosomal regions identical to those detected by multipoint linkage using microsatellites but with much less computation. We further show that this approach is successful because the probability of a double crossover between informative SNP loci is negligible. Our observations provide a rationale for using SNP arrays and recombination mapping as a rapid and cost-effective means of incorporating chromosome segregation information into exome sequencing projects intended for disease-gene identification.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3achromosome segregation 3acost effectiveness 3agenotyping 3ahaplotypes 3aloci 3amicrosatellite repeats 3apedigree 3apenetrance 3aprobability 3asequence analysis 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism1 aHan, Ted1 aCarlson-Donohoe, Hannah1 aAhaghotu, Chidi1 aHarper, Ursula1 aJones, MaryPat1 aChandrasekharappa, Settara1 aAnikster, Yair1 aAdams, David R.1 aNISC Comparative Sequencing Program, 1 aGahl, William A.1 aBoerkoel, Cornelius F.0 tMolecular genetics and metabolism.g2012 Mar., v. 105, no. 3 p.382-389dElsevier Inc.x1096-71927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ymgme.2011.12.0143Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02176naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245016000166300001600326520124700342592002801589650002201617650001101639650001801650650001301668650001501681650001501696773008201711856008401793852000901877655001201886IND60108150320221121095320.0141108e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010815032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2013.01.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Shenghu10aReliability models for DFIGs considering topology change under different control strategies and components data change under adverse operation environments  ap. 144-150.  aThe doubly-fed induction generators (DFIGs) are widely applied for wind energy conversion. Their reliability models are important to risk analysis of wind power systems, which has not been fully investigated due to changing topology configuration and sensitive reliability data. In this paper, three reliability models are newly proposed for the DFIGs. Under the doubly-fed mode, the DFIG is logically in series configuration with low reliability. With outage of rotor-side converter, or operation of crowbar against short current, the grid-side converter or the power grid provides var support. The DFIG operates as an induction machine, avoids tripping and yields high reliability. The DFIGs' reliability is also dependent on vulnerability of the mechanical components to the strong wind, vulnerability of the electrical components to the short current, effectiveness of the fault-ride-through capability, and possibility of strong wind and severe fault. Logistic curve is applied to modify unavailabilities of the mechanical and electrical components under the adverse operation conditions. The proposed models help to quantify the lifetime and determine the key component of the DFIGs, thus improves reliability of the wind power systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy conversion 3amodels 3arisk analysis 3atopology 3awind power 3awind speed0 tRenewable energy.g2013 Sept., v. 57 p.144-150dElsevier Ltdx0960-14817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2013.01.0333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02566naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245010700168300001600275500001500291520129400306592002801600650002501628650002401653650002201677650002201699650001401721650001001735650001801745650001501763650001201778650001401790653001601804653001601820700001601836700001801852700001501870700001701885700001601902773008601918856008402004990002302088852000902111655001202120IND60104032520221117233427.0141107e20131001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010403252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.matlet.2013.06.1092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWidanarto, W.10aThermal, structural and magnetic properties of zinc-tellurite glasses containing natural ferrite oxide  ap. 289-292.  a2019-12-04  aNatural ferrite oxide doped zinc-tellurite glasses are synthesized using the melt quenching technique at 850°C with chemical composition of (80−x)TeO₂·xFe₃O₄·20ZnO (x=0, 0.5, 1, and 2) in mol%. Precursor nanosized particles of natural magnetite are used as raw material of the ferrite oxide. A differential thermal analyzer, an X-ray diffraction spectroscope and a vibrating sample magnetometer are used to characterize thermal stability, structure, and magnetic properties of the glasses, respectively. The vibrating sample magnetometer reveals the paramagnetic nature of the ferrite oxide with magnetic susceptibility of 4.05×10⁻⁵m³kg⁻¹. Incorporation of oxide in the glasses affects the thermal stability factor, structure and magnetic properties of the glasses. The stability factor increases from 69 to 102°C and the glass structure exhibits an amorphous structure. The magnetization curve with a very small hysteresis (Mᵣ=7.0×10⁻³emug⁻¹, Hc=1.7×10⁻²T) and high saturation field can be observed on the addition of 2mol% ferrite oxide. This indicates the existence of ferrimagnetic cluster formation in the glass matrices. Our method is new, economic and may contribute towards the development of magneto-optic devices based on zinc-tellurite glasses.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical composition 3amagnetic properties 3athermal stability 3aX-ray diffraction 3aeconomics 3aglass 3araw materials 3ahysteresis 3amelting 3amagnetite 0amethodology 0anew methods1 aSahar, M.R.1 aGhoshal, S.K.1 aArifin, R.1 aRohani, M.S.1 aEffendi, M.0 tMaterials letters.g2013 Oct. 1, v. 108 p.289-292dElsevier B.V.x0167-577X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.matlet.2013.06.1093Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01956naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245014300171300001600314520091100330592002801241650001301269650001801282650001601300650002101316650001101337650001101348650000901359650000701368700002401375773010101399856008601500990002301586852000901609655001201618IND60102452520221120121635.0141106e20130327xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010245252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molstruc.2012.11.0602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVarlan, Aurica10aExploring the capabilities of TDDFT calculations to explain the induced chirality upon a binding process: A simple case, 3-carboxycoumarin  ap. 341-349.  aThe induced circular dichroism (ICD) spectra of 3-carboxycoumarin recorded at pH 7.4 in the presence of human and bovine serum albumins were used in correlation with theoretical (TDDFT) calculations to obtain the binding constants and information on the conformational changes of the ligand in the binding site. As it was shown that for the carboxylic acids or the carboxylate ions, the asymmetry element correlated with the occurrence of the ICD band in the presence of proteins is the torsion (τ) of the COOH (COO⁻) group in respect with the planar π system, TDDFT calculations were performed considering all the geometries characterized by 0⩽|τ|⩽90deg. The simulated circular dichroism spectrum shows that the sequence of the signs and positions of the bands are correctly predicted as compared to the experimental ICD spectrum for a torsion of the carboxylate group in the range of 60−70deg.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalbumins 3abinding sites 3ablood serum 3acarboxylic acids 3acattle 3ahumans 3aions 3apH1 aHillebrand, Mihaela0 tJournal of molecular structure.g2013 Mar. 27, v. 1036 p.341-349dElsevier B.V.x0022-28607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molstruc.2012.11.0603Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01852naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245012700167300001400294520069500308592002801003650001401031650002101045650001501066650001301081650001201094650001901106650001401125700001701139700001501156700001901171700001801190700001801208700001401226700001401240773008401254856008401338990002301422852000901445655001201454IND60104032620221117233314.0141107e20131001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010403262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.matlet.2013.06.0672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Mingpeng10a3D WO₃ nanowires/graphene nanocomposite with improved reversible capacity and cyclic stability for lithium ion batteries  ap. 29-32.  aWO₃ nanowires/graphene nanocomposite was synthesized via a facile hydrothermal method and evaluated as an anode for lithium ion battery.

METHODS: Experts from each center provided data on retail costs of the three most frequently used phenylalanine-free protein substitutes and low-protein foods at their center; reimbursement of protein substitutes and low-protein foods; and state monetary benefits provided to PKU patients. RESULTS: The mean annual cost of protein substitutes across 4 age groups (2y, 8y, 15y and adults) ranged from €4273 to €21,590 per patient. The cost of low-protein products also differed; the mean cost of low-protein bread varied from €0.04 to €1.60 per 100kcal. All protein substitutes were either fully reimbursed or covered by health insurance. However, reimbursement for low-protein products varied and state benefits differed between centers. CONCLUSIONS: The variation in the cost and reimbursement of diet therapy and the level of additional state benefits for PKU patients demonstrates the large difference in expenditure on and access to PKU dietary products. This highlights the inequality between healthcare systems and access to special dietary products for people with PKU, ultimately leading to patients in some countries receiving better care than others.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3abreads 3adiet 3adiet therapy 3aexperts 3ahealth insurance 3ahealth services 3apatients 3aphenylketonuria1 aDokoupil, K.1 aGokmen-Ozel, H.1 aLammardo, A.M.1 aMacDonald, A.1 aMotzfeldt, K.1 aNowacka, M.1 aRobert, M.1 avan Rijn, M.1 aAhring, K.0 tMolecular genetics and metabolism.g2012 Mar., v. 105, no. 3 p.390-394dElsevier Inc.x1096-71927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ymgme.2011.12.0043Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01015naa a2200241 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005500094040001800149100002200167245008600189300001600275520015300291592002800444650001100472650002400483650001700507773012700524856010100651852000900752655001200761IND50065168620221118110752.0151127e200706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006516862DNAL7 a10.1658/1100-9233(2007)18[453:EBAVBS]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGoodall, David W.10aExcerpta Botanica –– a valuable bibliographical source for vegetation science  ap. 453-454.  aAttention is drawn to a source citing some 90000 papers in vegetation science and related fields published before 1995.

The C/ZnO particles calcined at 900°C possessed the best photocatalytic performance and had a reaction rate constant (kₘ) of 0.859L·(g·min)⁻¹, which exhibited much higher photocatalytic ability than the ZnO calcined at 700°C (kₘ=0.326L·(g·min)⁻¹) and the P25 (kₘ=0.371L·(g·min)⁻¹).  aPublisher supplied data 3aultraviolet radiation 3asurface area 3aglucose 3amethylene blue 3afuels 3aphysicochemical properties 3acarbon 3azinc oxide 3acombustion 3airradiation 3aphotocatalysts 0aphotocatalyst1 aChou, Hung-Yu0 tPowder technology.g2013 Jan., v. 233 p.201-207dElsevier B.V.x0032-59107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2012.09.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02970naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245017900172300001600351520156400367592002801931650001101959650001901970650002101989650002002010650001002030650001402040650000902054650001202063650003702075700002002112700002202132700002302154700002002177700001802197700002002215700001802235700002202253700002402275700002002299700001702319773008202336856008502418852000902503655001202512IND60109101220221118030236.0141109e20110515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010910122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2011.02.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTamura, Moritaka12aA determination method of pristine multiwall carbon nanotubes in rat lungs after intratracheal instillation exposure by combustive oxidation–nondispersive infrared analysis  ap. 802-808.  aThis paper describes a method for determination of multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) in rat lungs after intratracheal instillation exposure. The MWCNTs were quantitatively decomposed to CO₂ by combustive oxidation and were then determined by non-dispersive infrared analysis. Samples were pretreated by acid digestion, muffle ashing and in situ preheating to remove interferences due to coexisting biological carbon from the lung tissue sample, while preserving the MWCNTs as in its their original form. The preservation was confirmed by transmission electron microscopic observation of the pretreated samples of exposed lung tissues and by the fact that the recoveries of MWCNTs spiked to the lung tissues were close to 100%. The detection limit for MWCNTs obtained by the proposed method was 0.30μg and the repeatability as expressed by the relative standard deviation was 5.6% (n=4). The method was sufficiently sensitive and precise to apply to real samples of rat lung to investigate the in vivo persistence of intratracheally instilled MWCNTs. To our knowledge, this is the first report of this type of sample pretreatment and direct determination of pristine MWCNTs without modification or tagging. Conventional indirect methods use tagging with other compounds or metal impurities in the CNTs for detection, and the detachment of these tags can increase uncertainties in the determination of the CNTs. The tags can also change how the CNTs persist in vivo, which can lead to an incorrect understanding of the persistence of pristine CNTs in vivo.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon nanotubes 3adetection limit 3alungs 3aoxidation 3arats 3atissues 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aInada, Masaharu1 aNakazato, Tetsuya1 aYamamoto, Kazuhiro1 aEndo, Shigehisa1 aUchida, Kunio1 aHorie, Masanori1 aFukui, Hiroko1 aIwahashi, Hitoshi1 aKobayashi, Norihiro1 aMorimoto, Yasuo1 aTao, Hiroaki0 tTalanta.g2011 May 15, v. 84, no. 3 p.802-808dElsevier B.V.x0039-91407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2011.02.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02111naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245011400168300001600282520095500298592002801253650002201281650002101303650002101324650001401345650002001359650001901379650002601398650002701424650002201451650002301473650001601496700001601512773009301528856008401621990002301705852000901728655001201737IND60103639620221120232042.0141106e20110131xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010363962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.matlet.2010.09.0552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhijiang, Cai10aOptical nanocomposites prepared by incorporating bacterial cellulose nanofibrils into poly(3-hydroxybutyrate)  ap. 182-184.  aA biocompatible polymeric nanocomposite was prepared by incorporating bacterial cellulose (BC) into a poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) matrix. The transparency of the PHB/BC nanocomposite was high due to the homogeneous nano-sized spherulite and nanofibril of PHB and BC, which are smaller than the wavelength of visible rays. The X-ray diffraction patterns of the PHB in the nanocomposite film showed peaks corresponding to the crystallized PHB. The thermal stability of PHB in the nanocomposite film has been improved. The morphology studies showed that the PHB molecules filled vacancies between BC nanofibrils. An increase in the mechanical properties was observed by incorporating the BC into the PHB matrix. This PHB/BC nanocomposite can be considered for various applications, such as display devices, tissue engineering scaffold, and food packaging, because of its improved mechanical properties along with biodegradability and biocompatibility.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3abiocompatibility 3abiodegradability 3acellulose 3acrystallization 3afood packaging 3amechanical properties 3apolymer nanocomposites 3athermal stability 3atissue engineering 3awavelengths1 aGuang, Yang0 tMaterials letters.g2011 Jan. 31, v. 65, no. 2 p.182-184dElsevier B.V.x0167-577X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.matlet.2010.09.0553Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01397naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245012100167300001800288520037300306592002800679650002300707650002200730650001300752650001400765700001400779700001500793700001400808700001400822700001600836700001700852773009700869856008400966852000901050655001201059IND60109728720221119004802.0141109e20110323xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010972872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2011.01.0582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGan, Haifeng10aOxidation of 1-benzyldihydroisoquinolines or 1-benzyltetrahydroisoquinolines with dioxygen to 1-benzoylisoquinolines  ap. 1320-1324.  aAn environmental-benign methodology to synthesize 1-benzoylisoquinolines from 1-benzyl-3, 4-dihydroisoquinolines or 1-benzyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolines using dioxygen as an oxidant was developed.

STUDY DESIGN: A nationally-representative survey was administered to pediatricians (n = 101), dermatologists (n = 26), and allergists (n = 26). Main outcomes included referrals to health care professionals, suggested/ordered laboratory tests, management approach (dietary, pharmacologic, or combination of both) by age, AD location, and severity. RESULTS: Significant differences were observed in referrals to healthcare professionals (P < .001). Pediatricians more frequently referred to dermatologists than allergists in mild (52.4% vs 32.0%) and moderate/severe (60.6% vs 38.1%) cases. Dermatologists referred to allergists less frequently for mild (9.1%) than moderate/severe (40.7%) AD cases. Pediatricians (59%), allergists (61.5%), and dermatologists (26.9%) reported treating at least some of their patients with AD with dietary management (infant formula change) alone (with or without emollients). Soy-based formulas were often used. For mild AD, the most commonly reported first-line pharmacologic treatments included topical emollients, topical corticosteroids, and barrier repair topical therapy/medical devices. Over 80% of physicians used a dietary and pharmacologic combination approach. Dermatologists were most likely to manage AD symptoms with a pharmacologic-only approach. AD lesion location influenced pharmacologic treatment in >80% of physicians. CONCLUSIONS: Significant and distinct differences in AD treatment approach exist among physicians surveyed. Most pediatricians and allergists use formula change as a management strategy in some patients, whereas dermatologists favor a pharmacologic approach. This diversity may result from inadequate evidence for a standard approach. Consistent methods for managing AD are needed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadrenal cortex hormones 3aatopic dermatitis 3achildren 3ainfant formulas 3ainfants 3alaboratory techniques 3amedical equipment 3apatients 3apediatricians 3asurveys 3atherapeutics 3atoddlers 3aUnited States1 aBoguniewicz, Mark1 aChamlin, Sarah1 aLake, Alan1 aNedorost, Susan1 aCzerkies, Laura A.1 aPatel, Vardhaman1 aBotteman, Marc F.1 aHorodniceanu, Erica G.0 tJournal of pediatrics.g2013 Dec., v. 163, no. 6 p.1747-1753dMosby, Inc.x0022-34767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpeds.2013.06.0733Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02602naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100001900192245010600211300001400317520143600331592002801767650001501795650002501810650001501835650001601850650001101866650001601877650001101893650001701904650001401921650001401935650001701949700002001966773010101986856008502087990002302172852000902195655001202204IND60110592020221116142411.0141109e20110925xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011059202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.toxlet.2011.05.10162doi7 aPMC31598112pmcid7 a216209372pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMumford, Helen10aPost-exposure therapy with recombinant human BuChE following percutaneous VX challenge in guinea-pigs  ap. 29-34.  aPoisoning by nerve agents via the percutaneous (p.c.) route is an issue because the slow absorption of agent could result in poisoning which outlasts the protection provided by conventional pharmacological therapy. The bioscavenger approach is based on the concept of binding nerve agent in the bloodstream, thus preventing nerve agent from reaching the target tissues and inhibiting acetylcholinesterase activity. One bioscavenger that has been extensively studied is human butyrylcholinesterase (huBuChE). Protexia® is a pegylated form of recombinant huBuChE. We used a guinea-pig model of p.c. nerve agent poisoning, using an implanted telemetry system to collect physiological data. Guinea-pigs were poisoned with the nerve agent VX (0.74mg/kg) (∼2.5×LD₅₀). Two hours following VX exposure, Protexia (72mg/kg) or saline control was administered intramuscularly. All guinea-pigs treated with Protexia (n=8) survived, compared to no survivors in a saline-treated control group (n=8). Survival following VX and Protexia treatment was associated with minimal incapacitation and observable signs of poisoning, and the mitigation or prevention of the detrimental physiological changes (e.g. seizure, bradycardia and hypothermia) observed in control animals. The opportunity for post-exposure treatment may have utility in both civilian and military scenarios, and this is a promising indication for the use of a bioscavenger.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aacetylcholinesterase 3ablood flow 3aguinea pigs 3ahumans 3ahypothermia 3amodels 3anerve tissue 3apoisoning 3atelemetry 3atherapeutics1 aTroyer, John K.0 tToxicology letters.g2011 Sept. 25, v. 206, no. 1 p.29-34dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0378-42747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.toxlet.2011.05.10163Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02604naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001800153245007100171300001600242520148000258592002801738650001001766650001101776650002001787650002901807650001101836650002001847650001201867650003401879650001501913650001801928700002101946700002401967700001801991773009002009856008702099990002302186852000902209655001202218IND60107579920221120044425.0141108e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010757992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pneurobio.2012.01.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeco, Gustavo10aBrain mechanisms for perceptual and reward-related decision-making  ap. 194-213.  aPhenomenological models of decision-making, including the drift–diffusion and race models, are compared with mechanistic, biologically plausible models, such as integrate-and-fire attractor neuronal network models. The attractor network models show how decision confidence is an emergent property; and make testable predictions about the neural processes (including neuronal activity and fMRI signals) involved in decision-making which indicate that the medial prefrontal cortex is involved in reward value-based decision-making. Synaptic facilitation in these models can help to account for sequential vibrotactile decision-making, and for how postponed decision-related responses are made. The randomness in the neuronal spiking-related noise that makes the decision-making probabilistic is shown to be increased by the graded firing rate representations found in the brain, to be decreased by the diluted connectivity, and still to be significant in biologically large networks with thousands of synapses onto each neuron. The stability of these systems is shown to be influenced in different ways by glutamatergic and GABAergic efficacy, leading to a new field of dynamical neuropsychiatry with applications to understanding schizophrenia and obsessive–compulsive disorder. The noise in these systems is shown to be advantageous, and to apply to similar attractor networks involved in short-term memory, long-term memory, attention, and associative thought processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3abrain 3acortex 3adecision making 3adecision support systems 3amemory 3aneural networks 3aneurons 3aobsessive-compulsive disorder 3aprediction 3aschizophrenia1 aRolls, Edmund T.1 aAlbantakis, Larissa1 aRomo, Ranulfo0 tProgress in neurobiology.g2013 Apr., v. 103 p.194-213dElsevier Ltdx0301-00827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pneurobio.2012.01.0103Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01841naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002600152245009700178300001600275520090500291592002801196650001401224650001501238650001301253650001501266700002101281700001901302773010001321856008601421990002301507852000901530655001201539IND60101597120221120033359.0141106e201107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010159712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhealeco.2011.05.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHennig-Schmidt, Heike10aHow payment systems affect physicians’ provision behaviour—An experimental investigation  ap. 637-646.  aUnderstanding how physicians respond to incentives from payment schemes is a central concern in health economics research. We introduce a controlled laboratory experiment to analyse the influence of incentives from fee-for-service and capitation payments on physicians’ supply of medical services. In our experiment, physicians choose quantities of medical services for patients with different states of health. We find that physicians provide significantly more services under fee-for-service than under capitation. Patients are overserved under fee-for-service and underserved under capitation. However, payment incentives are not the only motivation for physicians’ quantity choices, as patients’ health benefits are of considerable importance as well. We find that patients in need of a high (low) level of medical services receive larger health benefits under fee-for-service (capitation).  aPublisher supplied data 3aeconomics 3amotivation 3apatients 3aphysicians1 aSelten, Reinhard1 aWiesen, Daniel0 tJournal of health economics.g2011 July, v. 30, no. 4 p.637-646dElsevier B.V.x0167-62967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhealeco.2011.05.0013Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02189naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245012800166300001400294520091200308592002801220650001601248650000801264650002801272650001201300650001401312650002601326650002001352650001301372650001501385650001401400650001001414650001401424650002401438650002301462700002301485700002001508700002601528773008801554856008101642990002301723852000901746655001201755IND60108711020221122004525.0141108e20130301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010871102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.snb.2012.12.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSanz, Diego A.10aLow cost wireless passive microsensors for the detection of hazardous compounds in water systems for control and monitoring  ap. 26-33.  aIn the present work, we studied the design and fabrication of low cost passive microsensors for measuring hazardous compounds.

These wireless sensors are small enough to be placed inside pipes and recipients of more than 1cm in diameter. Sensors were tested with air, distilled water, acetic acid, pyridine, N,N-dimethylformamide and butanol, presenting high accuracy, repeatability and reproducibility among substances and sensors. The sensors showed a high resistance to corrosion and oxidation after cycling operation. The whole measuring system, that included the sensor and the coupling antenna, proved to be suitable for measuring low dielectric constant and low volatility compounds presenting an average standard deviations in the detection of any compound of 4.23%.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetic acid 3aair 3abiocompatible materials 3abutanol 3acorrosion 3aequipment performance 3ahazardous waste 3aindustry 3amonitoring 3aoxidation 3apipes 3apyridines 3asensors (equipment) 3avolatile compounds1 aUnigarro, Edgar A.1 aOsma, Johann F.1 aSegura-Quijano, Fredy0 tSensors and actuators.g2013 Mar. 1, v. 178 p.26-33dElsevier B.V.x0925-40057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.snb.2012.12.0273Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03108naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100001800189245011500207300001900322520145100341592002801792650002001820650001701840650001201857650001501869650002101884650001501905650001301920650001301933700001801946700002201964700002301986700002202009700002102031700002202052700002402074700002602098700001802124700002702142700002302169700001702192700002402209700002302233700002002256700002002276700002202296773012202318856008202440990002302522852000902545655001202554IND60100198920221121191235.0141105e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010019892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jaci.2012.02.0192doi7 aPMC40918102pmcid7 a224600742pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aValent, Peter10aContemporary consensus proposal on criteria and classification of eosinophilic disorders and related syndromes  ap. 607-612.e9.  aEosinophilia is an important indicator of various neoplastic and nonneoplastic conditions. Depending on the underlying disease and mechanisms, eosinophil infiltration can lead to organ dysfunction, clinical symptoms, or both. During the past 2 decades, several different classifications of eosinophilic disorders and related syndromes have been proposed in various fields of medicine. Although criteria and definitions are, in part, overlapping, no global consensus has been presented to date. The Year 2011 Working Conference on Eosinophil Disorders and Syndromes was organized to update and refine the criteria and definitions for eosinophilic disorders and to merge prior classifications in a contemporary multidisciplinary schema. A panel of experts from the fields of immunology, allergy, hematology, and pathology contributed to this project. The expert group agreed on unifying terminologies and criteria and a classification that delineates various forms of hypereosinophilia, including primary and secondary variants based on specific hematologic and immunologic conditions, and various forms of the hypereosinophilic syndrome. For patients in whom no underlying disease or hypereosinophilic syndrome is found, the term hypereosinophilia of undetermined significance is introduced. The proposed novel criteria, definitions, and terminologies should assist in daily practice, as well as in the preparation and conduct of clinical trials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclinical trials 3aeosinophilia 3aexperts 3ahematology 3ahypersensitivity 3aimmunology 3amedicine 3apatients1 aKlion, Amy D.1 aHorny, Hans-Peter1 aRoufosse, Florence1 aGotlib, Jason R.,1 aWeller, Peter F.1 aHellmann, Andrzej1 aMetzgeroth, Georgia1 aLeiferman, Kristin M.1 aArock, Michel1 aButterfield, Joseph H.1 aSperr, Wolfgang R.1 aSotlar, Karl1 aVandenberghe, Peter1 aHaferlach, Torsten1 aSimon, Hans-Uwe1 aReiter, Andreas1 aGleich, Gerald J.0 tThe Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology.g2012 Sept., v. 130, no. 3 p.607-612.e9dMosby, Inc.x0091-67497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaci.2012.02.0193Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01644naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002300152245003800175300001600213520075600229592002800985650001401013650001701027650002001044650002501064650001301089700002201102773010001124856008601224990002301310852000901333655001201342IND60101597220221120024454.0141106e201107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010159722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhealeco.2011.04.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFletcher, Jason M.10aGenetic lotteries within families  ap. 647-659.  aDrawing on findings from the biomedical literature, this paper introduces the idea that specific exogenously inherited differences in the genetic code between full biological siblings can be used to test within-family estimators and potentially improve our understanding of economic relationships.

We present evidence that family fixed effects estimators by themselves cannot fully account for the endogeneity of poor health when estimating education production functions. Further, our analysis elucidates the situations under which genetic markers can serve as instrumental variables for specific health conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aeducation 3agenetic code 3agenetic markers 3aproduction functions 3asiblings1 aLehrer, Steven F.0 tJournal of health economics.g2011 July, v. 30, no. 4 p.647-659dElsevier B.V.x0167-62967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhealeco.2011.04.0053Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02805naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094024002200134024001900156040001800175100002200193245015200215300001600367520141000383592002801793650001101821650001501832650001801847650002501865650001301890650001201903650002101915650002001936650001501956650001301971650001401984650002401998650000902022650002702031700002002058700002102078700002002099773011002119856008602229990002302315852000902338655001202347IND60101147520221118222405.0141106e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010114752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jdiacomp.2012.06.0072doi7 aPMC34959992pmcid7 a228323772pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJeon, Christie Y.10aPost-admission glucose levels are associated with healthcare-associated bloodstream infections and pneumonia in hospitalized patients with diabetes  ap. 517-521.  aOBJECTIVE: We conducted a case–control study to examine if short-term glucose control is related to healthcare-associated bloodstream infections (BSI), urinary tract infections (UTI), and pneumonia in hospitalized adults with diabetes. SETTING AND PATIENTS: We analyzed 205 BSI, 510 UTI, and 109 pneumonia cases and 989, 2463, and 543 controls matched by age, sex and hospital stay seen at a large healthcare system in Manhattan from 2006 to 2008. METHODS: We examined whether infection risk was associated with serum glucose measured at admission and within 2 days to infection, using conditional logistic regression. Co-morbidities, immunosuppressive medications, prior hospitalizations, and insertion of indwelling devices were considered as potential confounders. RESULTS: Admission glucose level was not associated with infection. Glucose levels of ≥110 mg/dL measured within 2 days to infection were associated with BSI (Odds ratios from 2.04 to 2.67). Glucose level of ≥180 mg/dL was associated with pneumonia (Odds ratio=2.30). Decrease in glucose levels from admission to the infection was greater for controls than for infected cases. CONCLUSION: Healthcare-associated BSI and pneumonia were associated with glucose levels prior to infection diagnosis, but not with glucose levels at admission. Persistently high glucose level could be an indication of an underlying undiagnosed infection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3ablood flow 3ablood glucose 3acase-control studies 3adiabetes 3aglucose 3aglycemic control 3ahealth services 3aodds ratio 3apatients 3apneumonia 3aregression analysis 3arisk 3aurinary tract diseases1 aFuruya, E.

According to model compounds, it is found that the chemical structure of La-GDTC toward silica is originated from hydrogen bonds and coordination bonds. The La-GDTC can effectively facilitate the fine dispersion of silica particles into the SBR matrix. Moreover, a jump in the normalized heat capacity ΔCₚₙ at the glass transition region and about 1.6–10.9% of the weight fraction of immobilized polymer layer χᵢₘ in the SBR/La-GDTC/SiO₂ composites are revealed. The La-GDTC can tune the origin polymer main chain into a softer one by endowing side chains, leading to a decrease in tan δ, as well as the glass transition temperature, of SBR/La-GDTC/SiO₂ composites. Mechanical properties of SBR/La-GDTC/SiO₂ vulcanizates are largely improved and better than those of the SBR/ZDC/SiO₂ vulcanizates. Thus, a reinforced mechanism of the La-GDTC system is proposed, which can account for the experimental observation well.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical structure 3aglass transition 3aglass transition temperature 3aheat 3ahydrogen bonding 3amechanical properties 3apolymers 3asilica1 aLiu, Lan1 aJia, Zhixin1 aJia, Demin1 aLuo, Yuanfang0 tPolymer.g2011 May 26, v. 52, no. 12 p.2701-2710dElsevier Ltdx0032-38617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.polymer.2011.04.0153Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01471naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245005400174300001800228520029000246592002800536650001500564650002300579650002300602650001300625650001800638650002400656650001400680653002000694653004400714653001800758653001300776653001100789700001900800700001900819700002400838700001700862773008900879856008400968852000901052655001201061IND60110120020221116144822.0161019e20130710xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011012002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2013.04.1102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSamala, Ramakrishna10aFacile total synthesis of gymnoconjugatin A and B  ap. 3624-3626.  aA facile total synthesis of the microbial natural products gymnoconjugatin A and B, isolated from soil microbe of Gymnoascus reessii has been accomplished using inexpensive raw materials, furfural and trans-methyl crotonate using Horner–Wadsworth–Emmons (HWE) and Wittig reactions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGymnoascus 3achemical reactions 3achemical structure 3afurfural 3araw materials 3asoil microorganisms 3asynthesis 0aGymnoconjugatin 0aHorner–Wadsworth–Emmons olefination 0aWeinreb amide 0aTetraene 0aPyrone1 aPatro, Balaram1 aBasu, Manas K.1 aKameswara Rao, N.S.1 aMukkanti, K.0 tTetrahedron letters.g2013 July 10, v. 54 p.3624-3626dElsevier Ltdx0040-40397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tetlet.2013.04.1103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02133naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245013900166300001600305520099500321592002801316650001501344650002501359650001101384650001401395650001701409650001601426700001301442700001801455700001701473700001301490700001401503700001401517700001401531773008601545856008401631990002301715852000901738655001201747IND60104033020221117233345.0141107e20131001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010403302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.matlet.2013.07.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Liqiang14aThe Cu₂S nano hollow-cactus arrays: A nanostructure with a larger specific surface area and the enhanced light absorption properties  ap. 300-303.  aLarge area Cu₂S nano hollow-cactus arrays (CNHC) are self grown out over the electrodeposited Cu semi-sphere arrays film during a simple solid–gas reaction at room temperature. The CNHC is composed of micrometer-sized hollow-cactuses with nano-sized Cu₂S “thorn” arrays over each cactus. The experiment results show that the light absorption ability of CNHC is enhanced, reaching 93%. Moreover, the CNHC presents two other features over the conventional regular-aligned nanowire arrays: first, the CNHC shows a more robust light absorption performance, the light absorption is almost not sensitive to the divergence of light incident, when the light incident angle is increased from 0° to 45°, the light absorption value of CNHC is decreased only 6.8% and second, the CNHC possesses a larger specific surface area over the same projected area.

The decades between the 1920s and 1990s then marked the discovery and biochemical characterization of the proteins comprising the complement system. Today, complement is defined as a complex system consisting of more than 30 membrane-bound and soluble plasma proteins, which are activated in a cascade-like manner, very similarly to the caspase proteases and blood coagulation systems. Complement is engrained in the immunologist's mind as a serum-effective, quintessential part of innate immunity, vitally required for the detection and removal of pathogens or other dangerous entities. Three decades ago, this rather confined definition was challenged and then refined when it was shown that complement participates vitally in the induction and regulation of B cell responses, thus adaptive immunity. Similarly, research work published in more recent years supports an equally important role for the complement system in shaping T cell responses. Today, we are again facing paradigm shifts in the field: complement is actively involved in the negative control of T cell effector immune responses, and thus, by definition in immune homeostasis. Further, while serum complement activity is without doubt fundamental in the defence against invading pathogens, local immune cell-derived production of complement emerges as key mediator of complement's impact on adaptive immune responses. And finally, the impact of complement on metabolic pathways and the crosstalk between complement and other immune effector systems is likely more extensive than previously anticipated and is fertile ground for future discoveries. In this review, we will discuss these emerging new roles of complement, with a focus on Th1 cell biology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCD4-positive T-lymphocytes 3aadaptive immunity 3abacteria 3abiochemical pathways 3ablood coagulation 3ablood proteins 3ablood serum 3acaspases 3acomplement 3ahomeostasis 3aimmune response 3ainnate immunity 3apathogens1 aLe Friec, Gaëlle1 aKemper, Claudia0 tSeminars in immunology.g2013 Feb., v. 25, no. 1 p.12-19dElsevier Ltdx1044-53237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.smim.2013.04.0123Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02806naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245010900169300001800278520178200296592002802078650001502106650001902121650001902140650001402159650002202173700002002195700001902215700002102234773011202255856008102367990002302448852000902471655001202480IND60104110320221116193509.0141107e201111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010411032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mcm.2011.05.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKolokotroni, E.A.10aStudying the growth kinetics of untreated clinical tumors by using an advanced discrete simulation model  ap. 1989-2006.  aPrior to an eventual clinical adaptation and validation of any clinically oriented model, a thorough study of its dynamic behavior is a sine qua non. Such a study can also elucidate aspects of the interplay of the involved biological mechanisms. Toward this goal, the paper focuses on an in-depth investigation of the free growth behavior of a macroscopically homogeneous malignant tumor system, using a discrete model of tumor growth. We demonstrate that when a clinical tumor grows exponentially, the following preconditions must be fulfilled: (a) time- and space-independent tumor dynamics, in terms of the transition rates among the considered cell categories and the duration of the cell cycle phases, and (b) a tumor system in a state of population equilibrium. Moreover, constant tumor dynamics during the simulation are assumed. In order to create a growing tumor, a condition that the model parameters must fulfill has been derived based on an analytical treatment of the model’s assumptions. A detailed parametric analysis of the model has been performed, in order to determine the impact and the interdependences of its parameters with focus on the free growth rate and the composition of cell population. Constraining tumor cell kinetics, toward limiting the number of possible solutions (i.e., sets of parameters) to the problem of adaptation to the real macroscopic features of a tumor, is also discussed. After completing all parametric studies and after adapting and validating the model on clinical data, it is envisaged to end up with a reliable tool for supporting clinicians in selecting the most appropriate pattern, extracted from several candidate therapeutic schemes, by exploiting tumor- and patient-specific imaging, molecular and histological data.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell cycle 3aimage analysis 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3asimulation models1 aDionysiou, D.D.1 aUzunoglu, N.K.1 aStamatakos, G.S.0 tMathematical and computer modelling.g2011 Nov., v. 54, no. 9-10 p.1989-2006dElsevier Ltdx0895-71777nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mcm.2011.05.0073Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02913naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245008300172300001600255520156300271592002801834650001801862650001601880650001101896650001501907650001601922650002001938650002101958650002001979650001001999650002102009650001702030650001902047650001802066650002302084650001702107650001302124650001402137650001602151650002602167700001802193773011802211856008202329990002302411852000902434655001202443IND60100199120221121191224.0141105e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010019912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jaci.2012.06.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIngram, Jennifer L.13aIL-13 in asthma and allergic disease: Asthma phenotypes and targeted therapies  ap. 829-842.  aDecades of research in animal models have provided abundant evidence to show that IL-13 is a key TH2 cytokine that directs many of the important features of airway inflammation and remodeling in patients with allergic asthma. Several promising focused therapies for asthma that target the IL-13/IL-4/signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 pathway are in development, including anti–IL-13 mAbs and IL-4 receptor antagonists. The efficacy of these new potential asthma therapies depends on the responsiveness of patients. However, an understanding of how IL-13–directed therapies might benefit asthmatic patients is confounded by the complex heterogeneity of the disease. Recent efforts to classify subphenotypes of asthma have focused on sputum cellular inflammation profiles, as well as cluster analyses of clinical variables and molecular and genetic signatures. Researchers and clinicians can now evaluate biomarkers of TH2-driven airway inflammation in asthmatic patients, such as serum IgE levels, sputum eosinophil counts, fraction of exhaled nitric oxide levels, and serum periostin levels, to aid decision making in clinical trials and drug development and to identify subsets of patients who might benefit from therapies. Although it is unlikely that these therapies will benefit all asthmatic patients with this heterogeneous disease, advances in understanding asthma subphenotypes in relation to clinical variables and TH2 cytokine responses offer the opportunity to improve the efficacy and safety of proposed therapies for asthma.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal models 3aantagonists 3aasthma 3abiomarkers 3ablood serum 3aclinical trials 3acluster analysis 3adecision making 3adrugs 3aimmunoglobulin E 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-13 3ainterleukin-4 3alaboratory animals 3anitric oxide 3apatients 3aphenotype 3aresearchers 3atranscription factors1 aKraft, Monica0 tThe Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology.g2012 Oct., v. 130, no. 4 p.829-842dMosby, Inc.x0091-67497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaci.2012.06.0343Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01882naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002300189245005400212300001600266520085200282592002801134650001401162650001801176650001501194650001501209650002801224650001101252650002001263650001701283773011801300856008201418990002301500852000901523655001201532IND60100199220221121191315.0141105e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010019922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jaci.2012.07.0102doi7 aPMC34622642pmcid7 a229397552pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZiegler, Steven F.10aThymic stromal lymphopoietin and allergic disease  ap. 845-852.  aThe importance of the epithelium in initiating and controlling immune responses is becoming more appreciated. For example, allergen contact first occurs at mucosal sites exposed to the external environment, such as the skin, airways, and gastrointestinal tract. This exposure leads to the production of a variety of cytokines and chemokines that are involved in driving allergic inflammatory responses. One such product is thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP). Recent studies in both human subjects and murine models have implicated TSLP in the development and progression of allergic diseases. This review will highlight recent advances in the understanding of the role of TSLP in these inflammatory diseases. Importantly, these insights into TSLP's multifaceted role could potentially allow for novel therapeutic manipulations of these disorders.  aPublisher supplied data 3aallergens 3aanimal models 3achemokines 3aepithelium 3agastrointestinal system 3ahumans 3aimmune response 3ainflammation0 tThe Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology.g2012 Oct., v. 130, no. 4 p.845-852dMosby, Inc.x0091-67497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaci.2012.07.0103Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02483naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245013000167300001600297520122100313592002801534650004401562650001601606650002201622650001101644650001001655650001201665650001601677650004401693650001301737700001501750700001301765700001901778700001701797700001901814700002101833773010101854856008601955990002302041852000902064655001202073IND60102453020221121030019.0141106e20130327xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010245302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molstruc.2012.12.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Gang10aExperimental and theoretical investigations on the tautomerism of 1-phenyl-2-thiobarbituric acid and its methylation reaction  ap. 372-379.  aIn the present study, 1-phenyl-2-thiobarbituric acid (1) was synthesized and the tautomerism of this compound was investigated by FT-IR spectroscopy, X-ray analysis and ¹H NMR study as well as quantum chemical calculations. It is found that compound 1 exists in triketo form in the solid state and in CDCl₃ solution while tautomerization was observed in DMSO-d₆, DMF-d₇ and CD₃OD solution. The geometry optimization of eight possible tautomers of 1-phenyl-2-thiobarbituric acid was performed in gas phase and in different solvents using COSMO method. The calculated results are in good accordance with experimental data. Additionally, the methylation reaction of 1-phenyl-2-thiobarbituric acid was investigated for the first time by combination of experimental and theoretical methods. The methylation product might be varied with three possible isomers because of the structural features of 1-phenyl-2-thiobarbituric acid. We identified the obtained methylation product by X-ray diffraction and FT-IR spectroscopy, and transition state search and energy calculation were conducted to elucidate experimental data, the results revealed that the theoretical calculations are consistent with experimental data.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-radiation 3aX-ray diffraction 3aenergy 3agases 3aisomers 3amethylation 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3asolvents1 aWang, Jian1 aNie, Han1 aTan, Shen-Peng1 aShi, Wei-Qun1 aZhao, Dong-Mei1 aCheng, Mao-Sheng0 tJournal of molecular structure.g2013 Mar. 27, v. 1036 p.372-379dElsevier B.V.x0022-28607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molstruc.2012.12.0173Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02444naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003600113040001800149100001900167245011600186300001600302520122000318592002801538650002701566650001701593650001501610650001201625650001801637650001501655650001001670650000901680650000701689650001901696650002101715650001401736650001301750650001801763650001601781700001701797773011701814856008201931852000902013655001202022IND60100645220221122154635.0141105e20110115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010064522DNAL7 a209744752pmid7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2010.10.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Jianying10aTuning the stop bands of inverse opal hydrogels with double network structure by controlling the solvent and pH  ap. 498-505.  aPolyacrylic acid (PAA) and polyacrylamide (PAAm) double network (DN) hydrogels with high mechanical strength (about 1.5MPa) are obtained when two kinds of monomer solutions of 4M AA with 5mol% crosslinker and 4M AAm with 0.1mol% crosslinker are used for the optimal preparation. Their high mechanical strength can be maintained even at high water content (above 50%) and at external stimuli (solvent and pH). This optimized DN hydrogel is used to develop the PAA/PAAm inverse opal hydrogel with DN structure by twice infiltration–polymerization and colloidal templating. Its photonic stop band can be tuned by controlling the solvent and pH. It first shows a small red-shift (about 20nm), and then a large blue-shift (about 180nm) with the increased ethanol content. For pH response, the DN inverse opal hydrogel has a large stop-band shift of about 140nm when the pH increases from 1.2 to 5.6. Moreover, the DN inverse opal hydrogel also shows rapid recovery ability without hysteresis phenomenon in strong acidic environment, good reproducibility and durability. The interaction between the independently crosslinked PAA network and PAAm network plays a significant role in determining the response performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical concentration 3acrosslinking 3adurability 3aethanol 3ahydrocolloids 3ahysteresis 3alight 3aopal 3apH 3apolyacrylamide 3apolyacrylic acid 3asolutions 3asolvents 3awater content 3awavelengths1 aHan, Yanchun0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2011 Jan. 15, v. 353, no. 2 p.498-505dElsevier Inc.x0021-97977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2010.10.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02324naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245010700166300001800273520134300291592002801634650001401662650001101676650002201687650001201709650002401721700002101745700001901766773011201785856008101897990002301978852000902001655001202010IND60104110520221116193609.0141107e201111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010411052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mcm.2011.05.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYeh, Ruey Huei10aOptimal length of lease period and maintenance policy for leased equipment with a control-limit on age  ap. 2014-2019.  aThis paper investigates the optimal length of lease period and maintenance policy for leased equipment. In order to have steady revenue, the lessor (owner) of equipment may provide a discount to encourage the lessee (user) to sign a contract with a longer lease period. However, as the lease period increases, the maintenance cost also increases due to the deterioration or usage of the equipment. Therefore, there is a need to determine an appropriate length of lease period and a corresponding maintenance policy for the leased equipment from the viewpoint of the lessor such that the expected total profit is maximized. In this paper, the following maintenance scheme is considered. When the leased equipment fails, a minimal repair is conducted to bring the equipment back to an operating condition. Furthermore, when the age of the equipment reaches a specified level (called as a control-limit), an imperfect preventive maintenance (PM) is carried out to avoid possible failures. Under this maintenance scheme, the mathematical model of the expected total profit is developed and the optimal length of lease period and the corresponding optimal maintenance policy are derived. Finally, some numerical examples are given to illustrate the effects of the length of lease period and the maintenance policy on the expected total profit.  aPublisher supplied data 3aequipment 3aincome 3aissues and policy 3aleasing 3amathematical models1 aZhang, Wenliang,1 aLo, Hui-Chiung0 tMathematical and computer modelling.g2011 Nov., v. 54, no. 9-10 p.2014-2019dElsevier Ltdx0895-71777nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mcm.2011.05.0093Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02490naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245011500164300001600279520139700295592002801692650001001720650002001730650002001750650001001770650001601780650001901796650001101815650001501826650000901841650001501850700001801865700001501883773010201898856008402000990002302084852000902107655001202116IND60110592520221116142514.0141109e20111010xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011059252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.toxlet.2011.07.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHrach, J.10aDevelopment of an in vitro liver toxicity prediction model based on longer term primary rat hepatocyte culture  ap. 189-196.  aThe assumption that compounds with similar toxic endpoints generate unique gene expression signatures has led to attempts to classify unknown compounds according to their genomic profile. However, studies reported so far have mostly been conducted in vivo. In this proof of concept study, we assessed the use of rat hepatocyte sandwich cultures in combination with a toxicogenomic classification method to generate a predictive in vitro toxicity classification model. After pre-incubation for 3 days, primary rat hepatocytes were treated for up to 9 days with 13 well known model compounds, changes in the global gene expression profile were measured and subsequently used for the establishment of a predictive classification model. A subset of 724 genes was capable of discriminating compounds with a misclassification rate of 7.5%. As a preliminary verification, the resulting classifier was applied to two blinded control compounds. The classification of compounds according to transient changes in global gene expression allowed the correct prediction independently from the knowledge of their underlying toxic mechanisms. The results of this first pilot study demonstrate the possibility of in vitro gene expression models to contribute to candidate selection early in drug discovery by improving the predictivity of toxicological studies and thereby reducing animal usage in toxicology.  aPublisher supplied data 3adrugs 3aearly selection 3agene expression 3agenes 3ahepatocytes 3ahepatotoxicity 3amodels 3aprediction 3arats 3atoxicology1 aMueller, S.O.1 aHewitt, P.0 tToxicology letters.g2011 Oct. 10, v. 206, no. 2 p.189-196dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0378-42747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.toxlet.2011.07.0123Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01696naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245014200169300001600311520066700327592002800994650001401022650001101036650002101047650001501068650001301083650001101096650001101107650001701118700002101135773008601156856008401242990002301326852000901349655001201358IND60104033320221117233233.0141107e20131001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010403332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.matlet.2013.07.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYun, Young Soo10aElectrochemical performance of heteroatom-enriched amorphous carbon with hierarchical porous structure as anode for lithium-ion batteries  ap. 311-315.  aHeteroatom-enriched amorphous carbon with hierarchical porous structure (HAC-HPS) was prepared for use as anode material for Li-ion batteries.

This has a negative impact on the sustainability of AD processes because of the financial outlay required to treat digestate before being discharged into municipal water treatment plants or natural water bodies. The main aim of this research was to investigate feasibility of producing an organic fertiliser using anaerobic digestate and limestone powders as the raw materials employing a high shear granulation process. Two‐level factorial experimental design was used to determine the influence of granulation process variables on, the strength, resistance to attrition and yield of the granules. It was concluded from the study that it is technically feasible to produce organic fertiliser granules of acceptable strength and product yield. Increasing the liquid-to-solid ratio during granulation leads to increased granule strength and better product yield. Although the strength of the granules produced was lower than typical strength of commercial synthetic fertiliser granules (about 5 to 7MPa), this could be improved by mixing the digestate with a polymeric binder or coating the particles post granulation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanaerobic digestion 3acoatings 3aenergy 3aexperimental design 3agranules 3alimestone 3amixing 3aorganic fertilizers 3apowders 3apublic water supply 3araw materials 3asurface water 3awastes 3awater treatment1 aJiangTao, Liu1 aAlbadarin, Ahmad B.1 aAllen, Stephen J.1 aWalker, Gavin M.0 tPowder technology.g2013 Jan., v. 233 p.245-254dElsevier B.V.x0032-59107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2012.09.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02133naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245004200168300001600210520122300226592002801449650001801477650001001495650001301505700003101518700003401549700001901583700002201602700002301624773008001647856008301727852000901810655001201819IND60104422120221120021756.0141107e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010442212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ymeth.2012.07.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKluiver, Joost10aGeneration of miRNA sponge constructs  ap. 113-117.  aMicroRNA (miRNA) sponges are RNA molecules with repeated miRNA antisense sequences that can sequester miRNAs from their endogenous targets and thus serve as a decoy. Stably expressed miRNA sponges are especially valuable for long-term loss-of-function studies and can be used in vitro and in vivo. We describe here a straightforward method to generate retroviral miRNA sponge constructs using a single directional ligation reaction. This approach allows generation of sponges containing more than 20 miRNA binding sites. We provide a basis for the design of the sponge constructs with respect to the sequence of the miRNA binding site and the sequences flanking the miRNA binding sites. In-silico validation approaches are presented to test the predicted efficiencies of the sponges in comparison to known target genes. In addition, we describe in vitro validation experiments to confirm the effectiveness of the miRNA sponges. Finally, we describe how the here described procedure can be adapted to easily generate sponges that target multiple miRNAs simultaneously. In summary, our approach allows rapid generation of single or combination miRNA sponges that can be used for long-term miRNA loss-of-function studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3abinding sites 3agenes 3amicroRNA1 aSlezak-Prochazka, Izabella1 aSmigielska-Czepiel, Katarzyna1 aHalsema, Nancy1 aKroesen, Bart-Jan1 avan den Berg, Anke0 tMethods.g2012 Oct., v. 58, no. 2 p.113-117dElsevier Inc.x1046-20237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ymeth.2012.07.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01920naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002800152245008700180300001800267520101100285592002801296650001301324650001401337650001901351650002201370700001701392773010301409856008601512990002301598852000901621655001201630IND60101597720221120024418.0141106e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010159772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhealeco.2011.07.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLamichhane, Dirga Kumar10aWater accessibility and child health: Use of the leave-out strategy of instruments  ap. 1000-1010.  aThis paper investigates the leave-out strategy of instruments by using the leave-out community ratio of household access to in-yard water sources and community water infrastructure as instruments for hours in fetching water time, and the data on disease symptoms. The results show that community-level access to clean water is significantly associated with both water-relevant and irrelevant disease symptoms, which suggests that the correlation between community-level access to clean water and child health is at least partially due to endogenous project placement potentially with respect to unobserved community wealth. The paper concludes that the OLS estimates have a potential endogeneity bias problem and that IV estimates under this strategy is subject to endogenous project placement and is not valid. A policy implication of this study is that careful attention should be paid to both self-selection and endogenous project placement in studying the effect of water accessibility on child health.  aPublisher supplied data 3achildren 3aequipment 3ainfrastructure 3aissues and policy1 aMangyo, Eiji0 tJournal of health economics.g2011 Sept., v. 30, no. 5 p.1000-1010dElsevier B.V.x0167-62967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhealeco.2011.07.0013Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03641naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002600152245014400178300001400322520208900336592002802425650002302453650001602476650001302492650001602505650001202521650002302533650002102556650001502577650001602592650002502608650002502633650001402658650001702672650001702689650001702706650002102723650001102744650001302755650002402768700002202792700001802814700002502832700001902857700002102876773010802897856008603005990002303091852000903114655001203123IND60101147920221118222929.0141106e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010114792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jdiacomp.2012.06.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOvergaard, Anne Julie10aSerum amyloid A and C-reactive protein levels may predict microalbuminuria and macroalbuminuria in newly diagnosed type 1 diabetic patients  ap. 59-63.  aBACKGROUND: In this study we evaluated the association of baseline levels of six different candidate proteins for the development of microalbuminuria and macroalbuminuria in type 1 diabetic patients, who were followed for approximately 30years. Two of the proteins are markers of inflammation: serum amyloid A (SAA) and C-reactive protein (CRP), three are involved in lipid metabolism: apolipoprotein A1, apolipoprotein E and adiponectin and the last protein, fibronectin, is related to structural changes. METHODS: A nested case control study population of 60 patients from an inception cohort of type 1 diabetic patients where 20 developed microalbuminuria followed by macroalbuminuria and 40 stayed normoalbuminuric during approximately 30years of follow-up time was used to evaluate baseline levels of the six candidate biomarkers. The proteins were quantified by multiplexed immunoassays. RESULTS: Log SAA levels were borderline predictor of microalbuminuria, HR 2.31 (1–5.4) p=0.053 in a univariate Cox regression model and predicted the development of macroalbuminuria HR 2.432 (1–6) p=0.049, also univariate. When adjusting for covariates, log SAA predicted the development of microalbuminuria with an HR 4.131 (1.1–15) p=0.03. Log CRP predicted the development of microalbuminuria, HR 2.928 (1.4–6.1) p=0.004, and macroalbuminuria, HR 2.785 (1.3–5.8) p=0.007 in univariate models. When adjusting for covariates, log CRP predicted the development of microalbuminuria with an HR 5.882 (1.7–20.9) p=0.006 and macroalbuminuria with an HR 3.233 (1.1–9.8) p=0.038. Apolipoprotein A1, apolipoprotein E, fibronectin and adiponectin were not associated with development of elevated albumin excretion rate. CONCLUSIONS: SAA and CRP baseline levels predicted development of micro- and macroalbuminuria during 30years of follow up, supporting the theory that inflammation is involved in the progression of diabetic nephropathy. Further studies are needed to fully establish the two proteins’ potential as additional biomarkers for the development of diabetic nephropathy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aC-reactive protein 3aadiponectin 3aalbumins 3aalbuminuria 3aamyloid 3aapolipoprotein A-I 3aapolipoprotein E 3abiomarkers 3ablood serum 3acase-control studies 3adiabetic nephropathy 3aexcretion 3afibronectins 3aimmunoassays 3ainflammation 3alipid metabolism 3amodels 3apatients 3aregression analysis1 aMcGuire, James N.1 aHovind, Peter1 aParving, Hans-Henrik1 aRossing, Peter1 aPociot, Flemming0 tJournal of diabetes and its complications.g2013 , v. 27, no. 1 p.59-63dElsevier Inc.x1056-87277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jdiacomp.2012.06.0163Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03219naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100002700192245006100219300001600280506007600296520180000372592002802172506003702200650001002237650001002247650001902257650000902276650002002285650001802305650001602323650001502339650002102354700001902375700001902394700002102413700001902434700002402453700002202477700002702499700002302526773010602549856008502655852000902740655001202749IND60100989920221207072417.0141105e20110610xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010098992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jconrel.2011.02.0212doi7 aPMC31142512pmcid7 a213855962pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPararas, Erin E.

It is ideally suited for drug delivery into small, sensitive and unique fluid spaces such as the cochlea. We characterized the pharmacokinetics of reciprocating drug delivery to the scala tympani within the cochlea by measuring the effects of changes in flow parameters on the distribution of drug throughout the length of the cochlea. Distribution was assessed by monitoring the effects of DNQX, a reversible glutamate receptor blocker, delivered directly to the inner ear of guinea pigs using reciprocating flow profiles. We then modeled the effects of those parameters on distribution using both an iterative curve-fitting approach and a computational fluid dynamic model. Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that reciprocating delivery distributes the drug into a volume in the base of the cochlea, and suggest that the primary determinant of distribution throughout more distal regions of the cochlea is diffusion. Increases in flow rate distributed the drug into a larger volume that extended more apically. Over short time courses (less than 2h), the apical extension, though small, significantly enhanced apically directed delivery of drug. Over longer time courses (>5h) or greater distances (>3mm), maintenance of drug concentration in the basal scala tympani may prove more advantageous for extending apical delivery than increases in flow rate. These observations demonstrate that this reciprocating technology is capable of providing controlled delivery kinetics to the closed fluid space in the cochlea, and may be suitable for other applications such as localized brain and retinal delivery.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abrain 3adrugs 3adynamic models 3aears 3afluid mechanics 3aglutamic acid 3aguinea pigs 3amonitoring 3apharmacokinetics1 aChen, Zhiqiang1 aFiering, Jason1 aMescher, Mark J.1 aKim, Ernest S.1 aMcKenna, Michael J.1 aKujawa, Sharon G.1 aBorenstein, Jeffrey T.1 aSewell, William F.0 tJournal of controlled release.g2011 June 10, v. 152, no. 2 p.270-277dElsevier B.V.x0168-36597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2011.02.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03777naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100001600189245011800205300001900323520190900342592002802251650001802279650001102297650001202308650001102320650001202331650003402343650001702377650001802394650001902412650002402431650001402455650002502469650000902494650001402503650003502517650003602552700002802588700002302616700002002639700002302659700001502682700003202697700001802729700002302747700001902770700002002789700001702809700001902826700002402845700002402869700002302893773012102916856008203037990002303119852000903142655001203151IND60100199420221121191300.0141105e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010019942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jaci.2012.04.0412doi7 aPMC35792162pmcid7 a226949302pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Xingnan10aGenome-wide association studies of asthma indicate opposite immunopathogenesis direction from autoimmune diseases  ap. 861-868.e7.  aBACKGROUND: Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of asthma have consistently implicated the ORM1-like 3 and gasdermin B (ORMDL3-GSDMB), IL33, IL-1 receptor–like 1 and IL-18 receptor 1 (IL1RL1-IL18R1), RAD50-IL13, thymic stromal lymphopoietin and WD repeat domain 36 region (TSLP-WDR36), and HLA-DR/DQ regions. OBJECTIVE: A GWAS of asthma was performed in a non-Hispanic white population. METHODS: A GWAS was performed in 813 Severe Asthma Research Program/Collaborative Studies on the Genetics of Asthma/Chicago Asthma Genetics Study cases and 1564 control subjects. The GWAS results were compared with those of the published GWASs of autoimmune diseases. RESULTS: Multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms in the TNFAIP3 interacting protein 1 (TNIP1) gene, which interacts with TNFAIP3 and inhibits the TNF-α–induced nuclear factor κB inflammation pathway, were associated with asthma: rs1422673 (P = 3.44 × 10⁻⁷) and rs10036748 (P = 1.41 × 10⁻⁶, r² = 0.67). rs1422673 was also associated with asthma in the published GABRIEL (P = .018) and EVE (P = 1.31 × 10⁻⁵) studies. The minor allele T of rs20541 in IL13 is the risk allele for asthma but the protective allele for psoriasis. The minor allele T of rs2395185 in HLA-DRA is the risk allele for asthma but the protective allele for ulcerative colitis. The minor allele A of rs2872507 in GSDMB is the protective allele for asthma but the risk allele for rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn disease, and ulcerative colitis. The T allele of rs10036748 in the TNIP1 gene is the minor protective allele for asthma but the minor or major risk allele for systemic lupus erythematosus and systemic sclerosis in non-Hispanic white or Chinese subjects, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with both asthma and autoimmune diseases might have opposite effects on immunopathogenesis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCrohn disease 3aWhites 3aalleles 3aasthma 3acolitis 3agenome-wide association study 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-1 3ainterleukin-18 3alupus erythematosus 3apsoriasis 3arheumatoid arthritis 3arisk 3asclerosis 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B1 aAmpleford, Elizabeth J.1 aHoward, Timothy D.1 aMoore, Wendy C.1 aTorgerson, Dara G.1 aLi, Huashi1 aBusse, W.

They largely include microRNAs (miRNAs) and short interfering RNAs (siRNAs), and they play key roles in gene and chromatin regulations. Here we describe in detail the method for an effective construction of the recently developed short tandem target mimic (STTM) technology to block small RNA functions in plants and animals. STTM is a powerful technology complementing the previous target mimic (TM) in plants and the miRNA sponge, as well as the recently defined endogenous competing RNA (CeRNA) in animals. We expect STTM will not only be effective in blocking small RNA functions in plants but will also become a popular approach in animals.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanimals 3achromatin 3agenes 3amicroRNA 3asmall interfering RNA1 aYan, Jun1 aGu, Yiyou1 aQiao, Mengmeng1 aFan, Ruiwen1 aMao, Yiping1 aTang, Xiaoqing0 tMethods.g2012 Oct., v. 58, no. 2 p.118-125dElsevier Inc.x1046-20237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ymeth.2012.10.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02541naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001300152245011500165300001300280520133400293592002801627650001801655650003601673650001001709650001701719650001801736650001101754650000901765650002101774650002501795700001301820700001201833700001401845700001801859700001401877700001501891773010701906856008602013990002302099852000902122655001202131IND60101148020221118222825.0141106e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010114802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jdiacomp.2012.08.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSu, Ying10aKB-R7943 restores endothelium-dependent relaxation induced by advanced glycosylation end products in rat aorta  ap. 6-10.  aOBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were to examine the effects of KB-R7943, an inhibitor of Na⁺/Ca²⁺ exchanger, on impaired endothelium-dependent relaxation (EDR) induced by advanced glycosylation end products (AGE) in isolated rat aorta. METHODS: Both acetylcholine (ACh)-induced EDR and sodium nitroprusside (SNP)-induced endothelium-independent relaxation (EIR) were measured after the rings were exposed to AGE in the absence and presence of KB-R7943. RESULTS: Co-incubation of aortic rings with AGE (0.1g/L) for 24h resulted in a significant inhibition of EDR, but had no effects on EIR. After incubation of the rings in the co-presence of KB-R7943 (0.1–10μM) with AGE for 24h, KB-R7943 (10μM) significantly attenuated impaired EDR. Superoxide dismutase (200 U/mL) and l-arginine (3mM) could ameliorate the impairment of EDR caused by AGE, whereas d-arginine (3mM) had no effect on EDR. Similarly, AGE decreased superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and the release of nitric oxide (NO), and increased superoxide anion (O₂ .⁻) production in aortic tissue. KB-R7943 (10μM) significantly decreased O₂ .⁻ production and increased SOD activity and the NO release. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that KB-R7943 attenuated the impairment of EDR elicited by AGE partially through scavenging oxygen free radicals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetylcholine 3aadvanced glycation end products 3aaorta 3anitric oxide 3anitroprusside 3aoxygen 3arats 3asuperoxide anion 3asuperoxide dismutase1 aMao, Nan1 aLi, Min1 aDong, Xia1 aLin, Fan-Zhen1 aXu, Ying,1 aLi, Yan-Bo0 tJournal of diabetes and its complications.g2013 , v. 27, no. 1 p.6-10dElsevier Inc.x1056-87277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jdiacomp.2012.08.0073Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02693naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001500153245012300168300001400291520148200305592002801787650001001815650002101825650001001846650000901856650002201865650001901887650001701906700002001923700001901943700002001962700001801982700001902000700001602019700002302035700001902058773008702077856008702164990002302251852000902274655001202283IND60107580520221120025750.0141108e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010758052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pneurobio.2013.01.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRüb, Udo,10aClinical features, neurogenetics and neuropathology of the polyglutamine spinocerebellar ataxias type 1, 2, 3, 6 and 7  ap. 38-66.  aThe spinocerebellar ataxias type 1 (SCA1), 2 (SCA2), 3 (SCA3), 6 (SCA6) and 7 (SCA7) are genetically defined autosomal dominantly inherited progressive cerebellar ataxias (ADCAs). They belong to the group of CAG-repeat or polyglutamine diseases and share pathologically expanded and meiotically unstable glutamine-encoding CAG-repeats at distinct gene loci encoding elongated polyglutamine stretches in the disease proteins. In recent years, progress has been made in the understanding of the pathogenesis of these currently incurable diseases: Identification of underlying genetic mechanisms made it possible to classify the different ADCAs and to define their clinical and pathological features. Furthermore, advances in molecular biology yielded new insights into the physiological and pathophysiological role of the gene products of SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6 and SCA7 (i.e. ataxin-1, ataxin-2, ataxin-3, α-₁A subunit of the P/Q type voltage-dependent calcium channel, ataxin-7). In the present review we summarize our current knowledge about the polyglutamine ataxias SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6 and SCA7 and compare their clinical and electrophysiological features, genetic and molecular biological background, as well as their brain pathologies. Furthermore, we provide an overview of the structure, interactions and functions of the different disease proteins. On the basis of these comprehensive data, similarities, differences and possible disease mechanisms are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3abrain 3acalcium channels 3agenes 3aloci 3amolecular biology 3aneuropathology 3apathogenesis1 aSchöls, Ludger1 aPaulson, Henry1 aAuburger, Georg1 aKermer, Pawel1 aJen, Joanna C.1 aSeidel, Kay1 aKorf, Horst-Werner1 aDeller, Thomas0 tProgress in neurobiology.g2013 May, v. 104 p.38-66dElsevier Ltdx0301-00827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pneurobio.2013.01.0013Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02379naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245015500168300001600323520124100339592002801580650001601608650001201624650002201636650001701658650001301675650001301688700001901701700001601720700002201736700001701758700002301775773010101798856008601899990002301985852000902008655001202017IND60102453320221121030100.0141106e20130327xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010245332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molstruc.2012.11.0362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDas, Kinsuk10aMononuclear, dinuclear and 1-D polymeric complexes of Cd(II) of a pyridyl pyrazole ligand: Syntheses, crystal structures and photoluminescence studies  ap. 392-401.  aThe syntheses, crystal structures and photoluminescence properties of four new Cd(II) complexes are reported using strongly coordinating ligand 3,5-dimethyl-1-(2′-pyridyl) pyrazole (L) in presence of anionic ancillary bridging ligands as nitrite, chloride and dicyanamide. Among the complexes two (1 and 2) are monomeric, 3 is μ₂ – chloro bridged dimer and the last one (4) is a mixed alternate chloro – end to end (EE) dicyanamide bridged 1D polymer. All the four complexes have been X-ray crystallographically characterized. The ligand L behaves as a potent bidentate neutral N, N donor. Geometrical diversity of Cd(II) complexes is due to no loss or gain of crystal field stability with the variation of geometry. Consequently the stability of a structure depends on steric requirements. The ligand L shows considerable fluorescence and all four complexes in methanol exhibit interesting photoluminescence properties with different emission intensities. The band maxima and fluorescence efficiency (in methanol) are found to be dependent on the coordination chromophore and structural rigidity induced by the incorporated Cd(II) ion. Among the synthesized complexes 1 exhibits the highest fluorescence intensity in methanol.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3acadmium 3acrystal structure 3afluorescence 3amethanol 3apolymers1 aKonar, Saugata1 aJana, Atanu1 aBarik, Anil Kumar1 aRoy, Sangita1 aKar, Susanta Kumar0 tJournal of molecular structure.g2013 Mar. 27, v. 1036 p.392-401dElsevier B.V.x0022-28607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molstruc.2012.11.0363Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01647naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002700147245009600174300001800270520051300288592002800801650002300829650002000852650002200872650001900894650001200913700002200925700001900947700001900966700002000985700002301005700002001028700002101048700002401069773009001093856008101183852000901264655001201273IND60109413720221121063022.0141109e20110923xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010941372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2011.07.0382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCappelletti, Graziella10aTubulin-guided dynamic combinatorial library of thiocolchicine–podophyllotoxin conjugates  ap. 7354-7357.  aThe use of tubulin as a target to influence the composition of the mixture from a dynamic combinatorial library, based on the disulfide bond exchange reaction, is described.

Among particular threats is highly pathogenic avian H5N1 influenza virus (HPAI) due to not only its high mortality in humans but also possible human-to-human transmission either through reassortment with other human influenza viruses such as 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza virus, or by genetic mutations. With the aim of developing effective vaccines against the H5N1 viruses, we generated two live attenuated H5N1 vaccine candidates against A/Indonesia/05/2005 (clade 2.1) and A/chicken/Korea/ES/2003 (clade 2.5) strains, in the genetic background of the cold-adapted donor strain of X-31. In mice, a single dose of immunization with each of the two vaccines was highly immunogenic inducing high titers of serum viral-neutralizing and hemagglutinin-inhibiting antibodies against the homologous H5N1 strain. Furthermore, significant levels of cross-clade antibody responses were induced by the vaccines, suggesting a broad-spectrum cross-reactivity against the heterologous H5N1 strains. The immunizations provided solid protections against heterologous lethal challenges with H5N2 virus, significantly reducing the morbidity and challenge virus replications in the respiratory tracts. The robustness of the antibody responses against both the homologous and heterologous strains, together with efficient protection against the lethal H5N2 challenge, strongly support the protection against wild type H5N1 infections. These results could serve as an experimental basis for the development of safe and effective H5N1 pre-pandemic vaccines while further addressing the biosecurity concerns associated with H5N1 HPAI.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInfluenza A virus 3aantibodies 3abiosecurity 3ablood serum 3achickens 3across reaction 3agenetic background 3ahuman influenza 3ahumans 3aimmunization 3amice 3amorbidity 3amortality 3amutation 3apandemic 3apublic health 3avaccines 3avirus replication 3aviruses 3aKorean Peninsula 0aLive attenuated influenza vaccine 0aCold-adaptation 0aH5N1 0aHighly pathogenic avian influenza virus 0aCross-reactivity 0aX-31 ca1 aJung, Eun-Ju1 aByun, Young Ho1 aLee, Kwang-Hee1 aLee, Eun-Young1 aLee, Yoon Jae1 aSeong, Baik Lin0 tVaccine.g2013 July 18, v. 31, no. 33 p.3339-3346dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2013.05.0803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03644naa a2200709 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003700113040001800150100001800168245009100186300001600277520162300293592002801916650002301944650001601967650001601983650001001999650002002009650002202029650001302051650002802064650001202092650001202104650001802116650001102134650002302145650001502168650001502183650001302198650000902211650001702220650002102237650001602258650001502274650005302289650001002342650002802352650001102380650001102391650000902402650004802411650002702459650002002486650001702506650003002523650001602553700002102569700002402590700002002614700002002634700002102654700002102675700001802696773009302714856008302807990002302890852000902913655001202922IND60102629320221119120618.0141106e201307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010262932DNAL7 a234341212pmid7 a10.1016/j.jpeds.2013.01.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRank, Melanie14aThe Cardio-Metabolic Risk of Moderate and Severe Obesity in Children and Adolescents  ap. 137-142.  aOBJECTIVE: To compare the cardio-metabolic risk profile between moderately obese and severely obese children and adolescents. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study involving 463 obese 6- to 19-year-olds who were referred to an inpatient weight-loss program. Anthropometric data were assessed and fasting blood samples were analyzed for lipid and glucose metabolism, adipokines, and inflammatory markers. Moderately obese individuals (percentiles corresponding to body mass index ≥30 to 35 kg/m² at age 18 years) and severely obese individuals (percentiles corresponding to body mass index ≥35 kg/m² at age 18 years) were defined by sex and age-specific cut-offs according to the International Obesity Task Force. RESULTS: The prevalence of the metabolic syndrome was three times higher in severely obese individuals compared with those who are moderately obese. Mean values for proinsulin, insulin, homeostatic model assessment-insulin resistance, triglycerides, and interleukin-6 were 30%-50% higher in severe obesity compared with moderate obesity. Concentrations of leptin and high-sensitive C-reactive protein were about 1.5-fold higher, adiponectin levels were 12% lower, and resistin levels 10% higher in severely obese individuals compared with moderately obese (all P < .001). CONCLUSION: Severely obese individuals have a markedly more unfavorable cardio-metabolic risk profile than those who are moderately obese. The results of this study underscore the substantial effect of severe obesity on health and highlights that these children need to receive particular attention regarding obesity treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aC-reactive protein 3aadiponectin 3aadolescents 3ablood 3abody mass index 3achildhood obesity 3achildren 3across-sectional studies 3afasting 3aglucose 3ainterleukin-6 3aleptin 3ametabolic syndrome 3ametabolism 3aproinsulin 3aresistin 3arisk 3arisk profile 3atriacylglycerols 3aweight loss 2aAdolescent 2aCardiovascular Diseasesxepidemiologyxetiology. 2aChild 2aCross-Sectional Studies 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMetabolic Syndromexepidemiologyxetiology. 2aObesityxcomplications 2aRisk Assessment 2aRisk Factors 2aSeverity of Illness Index 2aYoung Adult1 aSiegrist, Monika1 aWilks, Désirée C.1 aLanghof, Helmut1 aWolfarth, Bernd1 aHaller, Bernhard1 aKoenig, Wolfgang1 aHalle, Martin0 tJournal of pediatrics.g2013 July, v. 163, no. 1 p.137-142dMosby, Inc.x0022-34767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpeds.2013.01.0203Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01963naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245010500173300001600278520088900294592002801183650002501211650001501236650001701251650002201268650001401290650001601304700002201320700001601342700002101358700002501379700002001404773009601424856008401520852000901604655001201613IND60101977720221117160540.0141106e20130301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010197772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.memsci.2012.11.0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBeauger, Christian10aNafion®–sepiolite composite membranes for improved proton exchange membrane fuel cell performance  ap. 167-179.  aNafion®–sepiolite composite membranes were prepared, characterized and integrated in Membrane-Electrodes Assembly to be tested in fuel cell operating conditions.

The sulfonation of pristine sepiolite has improved its ion exchange capacity as well as that of composites membranes. The introduction of sepiolite in Nafion® also allowed simultaneously to increase its water uptake and to improve its mechanical features.

Next, nano-platelets were grown from the nanoparticles by further heat treatment in a salt matrix at 700°C. Removal of the salt and by-product phases after heat treatment led to well-dispersed platy haematite particles of 20–200nm in diameter with aspect ratio of 4–10.

The proposed thermo-responsive microspheres are composed of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide-co-acrylic acid) (PNA) microsphere matrixes and embedded poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) nano-gels, which have different volume phase-transition temperatures (VPTTs). The VPTT of PNIPAM nano-gels (VPTT₁) is lower than that of PNA microsphere matrixes (VPTT₂). Upon heating-up, the temperature increases across the VPTT₁ first and then the VPTT₂, as a result the PNIPAM nano-gels shrink earlier than the PNA microsphere matrixes. Upon cooling-down, the temperature decreases across the VPTT₂ first and then the VPTT₁, as a result the PNA microsphere matrixes swell earlier than the PNIPAM nano-gels. Consequently, large amounts of voids and channels form around the nano-gels inside the microsphere matrixes when the temperature changes across the range between VPTT₁ and VPTT₂, which are beneficial to the enhancement of water transport rate inside the microsphere matrixes. The experimental results show that, compared with normal homogeneous PNA (N-PNA) microspheres, the nano-gel containing PNA (C-PNA) microspheres exhibit remarkably fast response rate due to the hierarchical phase-transition mechanism attributed to different VPTT values of the embedded nano-gels and the microsphere matrixes.  aPublisher supplied data 3agels 3ananomaterials 3aphase transition 3apolyacrylamide 3apolyacrylic acid 3atemperature1 aXie, Rui1 aWei, Jie1 aJu, Xiao-Jie1 aWang, Wei1 aChu, Liang-Yin0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2012 July 1, v. 377, no. 1 p.137-144dElsevier Inc.x0021-97977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2012.04.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01634naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245010900164300001800273520052400291592002800815650001400843650002300857650001800880650002200898700001600920700001900936700001600955700001800971700001700989700001901006700001301025700001501038700001701053773009701070856008401167852000901251655001201260IND60109962520221121221846.0141109e20120725xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010996252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2012.04.1102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTang, Lei12aA new chiral sulfinyl–NH–pyridine ligand for Ir-catalyzed asymmetric transfer hydrogenation reaction  ap. 3839-3842.  aA new flexible C₁-symmetric tridentate ligand (S)-N-(2-(tert-butylsulfinyl)benzyl)-1-(pyridin-2-yl)methanamine sulfoxide (L1) was successfully prepared and utilized as a chiral ligand for Ir(I)-catalyzed ATH (asymmetric transfer hydrogenation) reactions.

The devices designed in this study can detect 2 Ab within a linear range of 11.2μg/mL to 112μg/mL, and the detection sensitivity and R-square are −0.64A/(g/mL) and 0.896, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aencapsulation 3agold 3aimmunoglobulin G 3aimmunosensors 3ananowires 3apolymers 3arabbits 3atitanium dioxide1 aChu, Yung-Ming1 aChang, Hsien-Chang0 tSensors and actuators.g2013 Oct., v. 187 p.533-539dElsevier B.V.x0925-40057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.snb.2013.03.0453Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01941naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006600148245016100214300001600375520071800391592002801109650001601137650001501153650001701168650003201185653000901217653001701226653001501243653001001258653001001268653001301278653002001291700006401311773011201375856008301487852000901570655001201579IND60630928320221122025716.0190328e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063092832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.trac.2019.01.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReyes-Garcés, Nathaly1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8859-319410aRecent developments and applications of solid phase microextraction as a sample preparation approach for mass-spectrometry-based metabolomics and lipidomics  ap. 172-181.  aThis review presents, from a critical perspective, the most remarkable and recent applications of solid-phase microextraction (SPME) as a sample preparation tool for mass-spectrometry-based targeted and untargeted metabolomics and lipidomics. In this review, the advantages and disadvantages of SPME as an approach for extracting/enriching metabolites of interest, either in targeted or untargeted studies, are discussed. In addition, special attention is given to SPME's suitability for use with in vivo and non-destructive sampling in order to capture a representative snapshot of the metabolome. Finally, future directions for further validating SPME's applicability in the metabolomics field are highlighted.  aPublisher supplied data 3ametabolites 3ametabolome 3ametabolomics 3asolid phase microextraction 0aSPME 0aMetabolomics 0aLipidomics 0aGC-MS 0aLC-MS 0ain vivo 0aMicroextraction1 aGionfriddo, Emanuela1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1836-19500 tTrends in analytical chemistry.g2019 Apr., v. 113 p.172-181dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11800x0165-99367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.trac.2019.01.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02709naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002200145245010200167300001600269520164300285592002801928650001201956650001701968650001401985650000901999650001302008650001902021650001302040650001202053650001302065650001702078650001802095650001502113651001302128700001902141773010602160856004802266852000902314655001202323IND4465646320221119140249.0120727e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446564632DNAL7 a10.1007/s10641-011-9823-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCiccotto, Patrick10aPatterns of shield darter, Percina peltata, distribution in the Eastern Piedmont of Maryland, USA  ap. 141-150.  aDetailed analyses of habitat associations with rare species are typically constrained by limited sample size and the availability of habitat data. The dense spatial coverage of stream sampling by the Maryland Biological Stream Survey provides ample data to quantitatively examine correlations between habitat and rare species distributions. The shield darter, Percina peltata, has a widespread distribution on the Atlantic Slope of the United States, but is uncommon throughout its range in Maryland. Associations of in situ physical habitat, water chemistry, and alterations in landscape with shield darter presence in the Eastern Piedmont physiographic province in Maryland were examined. Shield darter occurrence was associated with larger sized streams in concordance with the speciesâ known ecology. Shield darter distribution was further associated with stream segments with deep riffle habitats with diverse velocities, low concentrations of chloride and sulfate, low levels of urbanization in upstream catchments, and several pollution intolerant fish species. Although the exact mechanism of the effects is not clear, results indicate that the shield darter is sensitive to urban development and habitat and water quality alteration that typically accompanies urbanization. Shield darter conservation in Maryland necessitates the protection and restoration of minimally urbanized watersheds where they are known to occur. The results from this study indicate that habitat information on rare species may be important in elucidating important habitat associations that are not evident via examination of community level data.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPercina 3abiogeography 3achlorides 3afish 3ahabitats 3ahydrochemistry 3apiedmont 3astreams 3asulfates 3aurbanization 3awater quality 3awatersheds 3aMaryland1 aStranko, Scott0 tEnvironmental biology of fishes.g2011 Oct., v. 92, no. 2 p.141-150dSpringer-Verlagx0378-19097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10641-011-9823-1  aDNAL 7aarticle03961naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002600140245016000166300001800326520181100344592002802155596005202183596006702235596006302302596001902365650001602384650001802400650001802418650000902436650001602445650002402461650001202485650001602497650001702513650001802530650002002548650003002568650001802598650001102616650002002627650001002647650002402657650001602681650002402697650002902721650002202750653000802772653002502780653000902805653000902814653001502823653000702838653001302845700002002858700002102878700002702899700003502926700002402961700002002985700005903005773012803064856007403192852000903266655001203275IND60673755820221118111820.0191019e20190501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067375582DNAL7 a10.1093/pcp/pcz0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSoria-García, Ángel10aTissue Distribution and Specific Contribution of Arabidopsis FAD7 and FAD8 Plastid Desaturases to the JA- and ABA-Mediated Cold Stress or Defense Responses  ap. 1025-1040.  aTo overcome the difficulties to analyze membrane desaturases at the protein level, transgenic Arabidopsis plants expressing the plastidial AtFAD7 and AtFAD8 ω-3 desaturases fused to green fluorescent protein, under the control of their endogenous promoters, were generated and their tissue relative abundance was studied. Gene expression, glucuronidase promoter activity, immunoblot and confocal microscopy analyses indicated that AtFAD7 is the major ω-3 desaturase in leaves when compared to AtFAD8. This higher abundance of AtFAD7 was consistent with its higher promoter activity and could be related with its specificity for the abundant leaf galactolipids. AtFAD7 was also present in roots but at much lower level than leaves. AtFAD8 expression and protein abundance in leaves was consistent with its lower promoter activity, suggesting that transcriptional control modulates the abundance of both desaturases in leaves. AtFAD7 protein levels increased in response to wounding but not to jasmonate (JA), and decreased upon abscisic acid (ABA) treatment. Conversely, AtFAD8 protein levels increased upon cold or JA exposure and decreased at high temperatures, but did not respond to ABA or wounding. These results indicated specific and non-redundant roles for the plastidial ω-3 desaturases in defense, temperature stress or phytohormone mediated responses and a tight coordination of their activities between biotic and abiotic stress signaling pathways. Our data suggested that transcriptional regulation was crucial for this coordination. Finally, bimolecular fluorescence complementation analysis showed that both AtFAD7 and AtFAD8 interact with the AtFAD6 ω-6 desaturase in vivo, suggesting that quaternary complexes are involved in trienoic fatty acid production within the plastid membranes.  aPublisher supplied data  cSpanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness  aAGL2014-55300-RcMINECOdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100003329  aA09-17-RcGobierno de Aragón, strategic research projects  cFPI fellowship 3aArabidopsis 3aabscisic acid 3abiotic stress 3acold 3acold stress 3aconfocal microscopy 3aenzymes 3afatty acids 3afluorescence 3agalactolipids 3agene expression 3agreen fluorescent protein 3ajasmonic acid 3aleaves 3aprotein content 3aroots 3asignal transduction 3atemperature 3atissue distribution 3atranscription (genetics) 3atransgenic plants 0aABA 0aArabidopsis thaliana 0aFAD7 0aFAD8 0aFatty acid 0aJA 0aWounding1 aRubio, María C1 aLagunas, Beatriz1 aLópez-Gomollón, Sara1 aLuján, María de los Ángeles1 aDíaz-Guerra, Raúl1 aPicorel, Rafael1 aAlfonso, Miguel1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8190-51560 tPlant & cell physiology.g2019 May 01, v. 60, no. 5 p.1025-1040dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl50549x1471-90537nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/pcp/pcz0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02279naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001300148245007900161300001600240520102100256592002801277650001501305650001501320650002101335650003801356650001801394650001601412650001401428650001101442653002101453653002701474653001501501653002901516653001601545700001701561700001201578700001301590700001801603700002001621773011201641856008301753852000901836655001201845IND60630928420221122025700.0190328e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063092842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.trac.2019.02.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Long10aApplication of nano-ELISA in food analysis: Recent advances and challenges  ap. 140-156.  aOwing to its advantages such as simplicity, good sensitivity and ease of operation, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) has been a powerful tool in food safety and verification. However, the relatively low sensitivity and accuracy are the main limitations of traditional ELISA, which have hindered its application in food analysis. Thus, it is of ultra-importance to construct effective strategies to solve the problem. Till now, great progress has been made in boosting the accuracy, sensitivity and stability to improve traditional ELISA. Fortunately, the nanomaterials-based ELISA (nano-ELISA) greatly developed ELISA and behaved superior performance. In this review, recent advances about nano-ELISA are discussed in four basic parts including absorbent substrate, recognition element, enzyme label and chromogenic agent as well as the related application in food analysis, which provides a new train of thought and tactics for other techniques such as biosensors in electrochemistry, optics and magnetism.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorbents 3abiosensors 3aelectrochemistry 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3afood analysis 3afood safety 3amagnetism 3aoptics 0aVisual detection 0aFood safety inspection 0aBiosensors 0aNanomaterial-based ELISA 0aImmunoassay1 aLi, Guanghui1 aXu, Xin1 aZhu, Lin1 aHuang, Riming1 aChen, Xiaoqiang0 tTrends in analytical chemistry.g2019 Apr., v. 113 p.140-156dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11800x0165-99367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.trac.2019.02.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03081naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245008600173300001800259520164500277592002801922650000801950650001301958650001501971650001601986650001802002650001302020650001202033650001102045650002402056650001802080650001402098650001402112650001202126700002302138700001802161700005802179700006802237700006302305700006102368773011302429856008402542852000902626655001202635IND60630596220190612000000.0190213e20190114xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063059622DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.8b027072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLanfranco, Roberta10aKinetics of Nanoparticle–Membrane Adhesion Mediated by Multivalent Interactions  ap. 2002-2012.  aMultivalent adhesive interactions mediated by a large number of ligands and receptors underpin many biological processes, including cell adhesion and the uptake of particles, viruses, parasites, and nanomedical vectors. In materials science, multivalent interactions between colloidal particles have enabled unprecedented control over the phase behavior of self-assembled materials. Theoretical and experimental studies have pinpointed the relationship between equilibrium states and microscopic system parameters such as the ligand–receptor binding strength and their density. In regimes of strong interactions, however, kinetic factors are expected to slow down equilibration and lead to the emergence of long-lived out-of-equilibrium states that may significantly influence the outcome of self-assembly experiments and the adhesion of particles to biological membranes. Here we experimentally investigate the kinetics of adhesion of nanoparticles to biomimetic lipid membranes. Multivalent interactions are reproduced by strongly interacting DNA constructs, playing the role of both ligands and receptors. The rate of nanoparticle adhesion is investigated as a function of the surface density of membrane-anchored receptors and the bulk concentration of nanoparticles and is observed to decrease substantially in regimes where the number of available receptors is limited compared to the overall number of ligands. We attribute such peculiar behavior to the rapid sequestration of available receptors after initial nanoparticle adsorption. The experimental trends and the proposed interpretation are supported by numerical simulations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aadhesion 3aadsorption 3abiomimetics 3acell adhesion 3acolloids 3aligands 3alipids 3amathematical models 3ananoparticles 3aparasites 3areceptors 3aviruses1 aJana, Pritam Kumar1 aTunesi, Lucia1 aCicuta, Pietro1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9193-84961 aMognetti, Bortolo Matteo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7960-82241 aDi Michele, Lorenzo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1458-97471 aBruylants, Gilles1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1752-58260 tLangmuir.g2019 Jan. 14, v. 35, no. 6 p.2002-2012dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19170x1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.8b027073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02689naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245010000169520129600269592002801565650001301593650001601606650001501622650001601637650001601653650002201669650003201691650001601723650001501739650002401754650001401778653002701792653002101819653001701840653002501857700001801882700002501900700002301925700002601948700002501974700001301999773012502012856008502137852000902222655001202231IND60770059720221122115445.0220423e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077005972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compag.2022.1068372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRuchay, Alexey10aComparative analysis of machine learning algorithms for predicting live weight of Hereford cows  aBody weight prediction of livestock helps us to control the health of animals, efficiently conduct genetic selection, and estimate the optimal slaughter time. Precise and expensive industrial scales are used to measure live weight on large farms. A more affordable alternative is weight estimation by indirect methods, based on morphometric measurements of livestock, followed by the use of regression equations relating such measurements to body weight. Manual measurements on animals with a tape measure require trained workers and are stressful for both the worker and animal. Nowadays, machine learning technologies are being used to accurately predict body weight. This paper provides a comparative analysis of various machine learning methods for estimating the live weight of Hereford cows in terms of the coefficient of determination, root mean squared error, mean absolute error, and mean absolute percentage error. We show that machine learning algorithms perform better than common linear regression algorithms. Specifically, the ExtraTreesRegressor algorithm yields the highest prediction quality of the live weight of Hereford cows in terms of R2 among the tested machine learning algorithms. Potential applicability of these methods in the livestock industry is also discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHereford 3aagriculture 3aalgorithms 3abody weight 3aelectronics 3agenetic selection 3alivestock and meat industry 3amorphometry 3aprediction 3aregression analysis 3aslaughter 0aLive weight estimation 0aMachine learning 0aHereford cow 0aRegression algorithm1 aKober, Vitaly1 aDorofeev, Konstantin1 aKolpakov, Vladimir1 aDzhulamanov, Kinispay1 aKalschikov, Vsevolod1 aGuo, Hao0 tComputers and electronics in agriculture.g2022 Apr., v. 195 p.106837-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl38096x0168-16997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compag.2022.1068373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03026naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005300150245013200203520162500335592002801960650001301988650001102001650002302012650001302035650001202048650002102060650001502081650001502096650002002111650001502131650001002146653002202156653003002178653002302208653002202231653000702253653002202260700002002282700001902302700003002321700002602351773009702377856008502474852000902559655001202568IND60736339320221120051502.0211114e20210701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073633932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.watres.2021.1171992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLei, Yang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0709-474310aElectrochemical recovery of phosphorus from wastewater using tubular stainless-steel cathode for a scalable long-term operation  aPhosphorus (P) is an irreplaceable element, playing a vital role in living organisms, yet has limited earth reserves. The possibility of P recovery from wastewaters by electrochemically-induced calcium phosphate precipitation (ECaPP) was demonstrated previously. The current study presents a novel scalable prototype consisting of a column-shaped electrochemical reactor, a tubular stainless-steel cathode, and a Pt coated Ti anode. The adhesion of solids to the cathode, important for product recovery, was shown not to be negatively impacted by electrodes’ vertical placement. The influence of current (density), hydraulic retention time (HRT), and initial phosphate concentration in this prototype were examined under continuous flow operation. The system accomplished the highest P removal rate (1267 mg/day) at 1.5 d HRT and 800 mA in treating undiluted cheese wastewater with 48.5 kWh/kg P. Moreover, the prototype showed high stability and efficiency (> 50%) over 173 days of continuous operation without performing maintenance. After turning off the current (0 mA), the system realized a surprising P removal jump up to 97.3%, revealing the delayed diffusion of hydroxide ions by the deposition layer. The calculation of CAPEX and OPEX of ECaPP in treating 100 m³ cheese wastewater per week indicates that the ECaPP plant can realize net-positive from the 12ᵗʰ year. The recovered solids have relatively high P content (> 9wt%) and insignificant contamination of heavy metals. Overall, the proven suitability of the scalable prototype can pave the way towards the actual adoption of the ECaPP process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3aanodes 3acalcium phosphates 3acathodes 3acheeses 3aelectrochemistry 3aphosphorus 3aprototypes 3astainless steel 3awastewater 3awater 0aPhosphate removal 0aContinuous flow operation 0aEnergy consumption 0aCalcium phosphate 0apH 0aCheese wastewater1 aZhan, Zhengshuo1 aSaakes, Michel1 avan der Weijden, Renata D1 aBuisman, Cees J. N.0 tWater research.g2021 July 01, v. 199 p.117199-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1966x0043-13547nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2021.1171993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03422naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004400111040001800155100002200173245014700195300001600342520139200358592002801750650002501778650001001803650001801813650003101831650001801862650002901880650002801909650002101937650001301958650001801971650001901989650003702008650002302045650001702068650004102085650002102126650003202147650002802179650003002207650005202237650001302289650004402302650001402346650002402360650003302384650004102417700002402458700001802482700001802500700002302518700001702541773010302558852000902661856009002670945002502760946001102785655001202796IND4361942920221120223556.0160628e200311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436194292DNAL7 a150106112pmid7 a10.1023/B:PLAN.0000019064.55734.522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTamaoki, Masanori10aTranscriptome analysis of O3-exposed Arabidopsis reveals that multiple signal pathways act mutually antagonistically to induce gene expression  ap. 443-456.  aTo analyze cellular responses to ozone (O₃), we performed a large-scale analysis of the Arabidopsis transcriptome after plants were exposed to O₃ for 12 h. By using cDNA macroarray technology, we identified 205 non-redundant expressed sequence tags (ESTs) that were regulated by O₃. Of these, 157 were induced and 48 were suppressed by O₃. A substantial proportion of these ESTs had predicted functions in cell rescue/defense processes. Using these isolated ESTs, we also undertook a comprehensive investigation of how three hormones, ethylene (ET), jasmonic acid (JA), and salicylic acid (SA), interact to regulate O₃-induced genes in various genetic backgrounds of Arabidopsis, such as the ET-insensitive ein2-1, JA-resistant jar1-1, and SA-insensitive npr1-1. The expression of half of the 157 induced genes, especially cell rescue/defense genes, was controlled by ET and JA signaling, indicating that O₃-induced defense gene expression at this stage was mainly regulated by ET and JA. Clustering analysis of the 157 O₃-induced gene expressions revealed that multiple signal pathways act mutually antagonistically to induce the expression of these genes, and many cell rescue/defense genes induced by ET and JA signal pathways were suppressed by SA signaling, suggesting that the SA pathway acts as a strong antagonist to gene expression induced by ET and JA signaling.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aozone 3aair pollution 3agene expression regulation 3amessenger RNA 3atranscription (genetics) 3aexpressed sequence tags 3astructural genes 3aethylene 3ajasmonic acid 3asalicylic acid 3agenetic techniques and protocols 3adefense mechanisms 3aplant stress 2aArabidopsisxdrug effectsxgenetics. 2aCluster Analysis 2aCyclopentanesxpharmacology 2aEthylenesxpharmacology 2aGene Expression Profiling 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plantxdrug effects 2aMutation 2aOligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis 2aOxylipins 2aOzonexpharmacology 2aSalicylic Acidxpharmacology 2aTranscription, Geneticxdrug effects1 aNakajima, Nobuyoshi1 aKubo, Akihiro1 aAono, Mitsuko1 aMatsuyama, Takashi1 aSaji, Hikaru0 tPlant molecular biology.g2003 Nov., v. 53, no. 4 p.443-456dSpringer Netherlandsx0167-44127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1023/B:PLAN.0000019064.55734.523Available from publisher's site  aINDdRHFe2004/04/13  aNon-US 7aarticle02614naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100000700141245015100148300001600299520134900315592002801664650002601692650001401718650001301732650002101745650000901766650001001775650001301785650000901798653002401807653002601831653002501857653002101882653002201903653002301925700000701948700000701955700000701962773013701969856007702106852000902183655001202192IND60516540220221117205128.0160326e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051654022DNAL7 a10.1638/2015-0216.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 a, 10aIntraocular pressure in southern rockhopper (eudyptes chrysocome) and macaroni penguins (eudyptes chrysolophus): evaluation of influencing factors  ap. 223-235.  aOphthalmic examinations were performed on 160 macaroni penguins (Eudyptes chrysolophus) and 90 southern rockhopper penguins (Eudyptes chrysocome) at eight North American zoos and aquaria. Intraocular pressure (IOP) was measured using rebound tonometry while penguins were held in two different body positions. Correlations between IOP and factors including age, body position, eye pathology, and housing parameters were evaluated. Normal macaroni penguins had a mean IOP of 42.0 ± 9.7 mm Hg. Normal rockhopper penguins had a mean IOP of 32.9 ± 6.2 mm Hg. Neither species had significantly different IOP between sexes or between left and right eyes of the same penguin. In both species, there was a negative linear correlation between age and IOP. In the macaroni population, IOP was significantly higher when IOP measurement was performed before ophthalmic exam; this was not true in rockhoppers. In both species, IOP measured in a horizontal body position was significantly higher than IOP measured in a vertical body position. In both species, eyes with corneal lesions had significantly lower IOP than normal eyes. In the macaroni penguin, eyes with rubeosis iridis had significantly lower IOP than normal eyes.

In using organic residues to produce energy, and safely recycling the digested residues back into the farming system, a biogas digester could be a central component of many holistic systems. This paper discusses the influence of environmental, socioeconomic and cultural constraints on the use of biogas digesters in holistic farming systems in Sub-Saharan Africa. In higher altitude areas where maintenance of optimal temperature can constrain anaerobic digestion, floating drum or fixed dome digesters are a better option than flexible balloon digesters because they are less susceptible to temperature changes. If water is a key constraint, rainwater harvesting could be used to reduce the additional labour needed to collect water. If energy is the most limiting resource in the farming system, the optimum use of organic residues might be as a fuel for anaerobic digestion, whereas, if water is limiting, energy production by burning or pyrolysis might be a better option. The bioslurry from anaerobic digestion can be used in fish ponds to produce plankton to feed fish, and can be applied to fertile fields and fields of intermediate fertility, while biochar from pyrolysis is better used to improve the soil in infertile fields. If labour is limiting, it is particularly important that the system design minimises any additional labour needed to process the organic residues on a daily basis, considering trade-offs between labour and other resources.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaltitude 3aanaerobic digestion 3abiochar 3abiogas 3aburning 3aenergy 3afarmers 3afarming systems 3afarms 3afinance 3afish feeds 3afish ponds 3alabor 3anutrients 3aplankton 3apyrolysis 3arecycling 3asoil 3asystems engineering 3atemperature 3awater harvesting 3aSub-Saharan Africa 0aBiogas 0aHolistic farming 0aResource use 0aSub-Saharan Africa 0aAnaerobic digestion1 aAnchang, Kenneth Yongabi,1 aSubedi, Madhu1 aSmith, Jo0 tBiomass and bioenergy.g2014 Nov., v. 70 p.4-16dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl3929140x0961-95347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biombioe.2014.02.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03160naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245011200163300001600275520169900291592002801990650001702018650002002035650001202055650001602067650002002083650002602103650001402129650001002143650001902153650000802172650001002180650001102190650001102201650001402212650000902226650002202235650001802257650001602275651001602291700002302307700002202330700002102352700002002373700002202393700002502415773011902440856007402559852000902633655001202642IND60447162420221117223839.0151029e201511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044716242DNAL7 a10.1111/icad.121372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIlyashuk, Elena A.10aBiodiversity dynamics of chironomid midges in high‐altitude lakes of the Alps over the past two millennia  ap. 547-561.  aClimate change is one of the key drivers of changes in the biodiversity of the planet. There is, however, a general lack of long‐term data sets showing trends in taxonomic diversity of aquatic insects in high mountain environments particularly vulnerable to climate change. Using palaeolimnological techniques, we explored the changes in subfossil chironomid assemblages from three remote water bodies in the Eastern Alps, with the main focus on taxonomic turnover over different intervals of the late Holocene. Major changes in the assemblages coincided with shifts between different climate regimes and were mainly associated with the taxonomic shifts indicating the crossing ecological thresholds related to the ice‐cover duration in alpine lakes. Patterns of assemblage turnover through the past 2000 years differ between the study sites. Nevertheless, despite site‐specific differences in the physical setting and taxonomic composition, the study sites reveal substantial chironomid assemblage turnover (>1.0 SD) since AD 1850. The highest chironomid turnover (0.87 SD) over the last 30 years (AD 1980–2010), more than three times greater (0.26 SD) than in the previous 30 years, is observed in the lake situated at the highest elevation among the study lakes. Applying non‐linear structural equation modelling, we found that cold‐season (October–May) temperatures and therefore lake ice phenology are among the most important environment variables affecting the chironomid assemblages. The results of this study suggest that further climate warming will increase the risk of ecological alterations in remote Alpine freshwaters, including major shifts in chironomid fauna.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChironomidae 3aaquatic insects 3aclimate 3acold season 3adata collection 3aenvironmental factors 3aequations 3afauna 3aglobal warming 3aice 3alakes 3amidges 3amodels 3aphenology 3arisk 3aspecies diversity 3asurface water 3atemperature 3aAlps region1 aIlyashuk, Boris P.1 aTylmann, Wojciech1 aKoinig, Karin A.1 aPsenner, Roland1 aLeather, Simon R.1 aHassall, Christopher0 tInsect conservation and diversity.g2015 Nov., v. 8, no. 6 p.547-561dRoyal Entomological Societyx1752-458X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/icad.121373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03267naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245007300157300001800230520159800248592002801846596010301874596004901977650001602026650002002042650002502062650001002087650001002097650002102107650001202128650002102140650001102161650001202172650000902184650001702193650001402210650002102224650001302245650001602258650002602274653002502300653001802325653002602343653003502369653001302404700002002417700002002437700002702457700001802484773012802502856007402630852000902704655001202713IND60673756020221118111613.0191019e20190501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067375602DNAL7 a10.1093/pcp/pcz0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Lifang10aFunctional Overlap of Long-Chain Acyl-CoA Synthetases in Arabidopsis  ap. 1041-1054.  aLong-chain acyl-CoA synthetases (LACSs) play diverse and essential roles in lipid metabolism. The genomes of model eukaryotic organisms encode multiple LACS genes, and the substrate specificities of LACS homologs often overlap substantially. Homologous LACSs tend to differ in their expression patterns, localizations, and, by extension, the metabolic pathways to which they contribute. The Arabidopsis genome encodes a family of nine LACS genes, which have been characterized largely by reverse genetic analysis of mutant phenotypes. Because of redundancy, distinguishing the contributions of some Arabidopsis LACS genes has been challenging. Here, we have attempted to clarify the functions of LACSs that functionally overlap by synopsizing the results of previous work, isolating a suite of higher-order mutants that were previously lacking, and analyzing oil, wax, cutin, cuticle permeability, fertility and growth phenotypes. LACS1, LACS2, LACS4, LACS8 and LACS9 all affect cuticular lipid metabolism, but have different precise roles. Seed set, seed weight and storage oil amounts of higher-order lacs1, lacs2, lacs4, lacs8 and lacs9 mutants vary greatly, with these traits subject to different effects of fertility and oil synthesis defects. LACS4, LACS8 and LACS9 have partially redundant roles in development, as lacs4 lacs8 and lacs4 lacs9 double mutants are dwarf. lacs4 lacs8 lacs9 triple mutants were not recovered, and are assumed to be non-viable. Together, these results sketch a complex network of functions and functional interactions within the Arabidopsis LACS gene family.  aPublisher supplied data  cNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canadadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100000038  cNSERCdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100000038 3aArabidopsis 3aacyl coenzyme A 3abiochemical pathways 3acutin 3agenes 3agenetic analysis 3aligases 3alipid metabolism 3amodels 3amutants 3aoils 3apermeability 3aphenotype 3areverse genetics 3aseed set 3aseed weight 3asubstrate specificity 0aArabidopsis thaliana 0aCuticular wax 0aFunctional redundancy 0aLong-chain acyl-CoA synthetase 0aSeed oil1 aHaslam, Tegan M1 aSonntag, Annika1 aMolina Martos, Isabel,1 aKunst, Ljerka0 tPlant & cell physiology.g2019 May 01, v. 60, no. 5 p.1041-1054dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl50549x1471-90537nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/pcp/pcz0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02063naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245009500165500001400260520095400274592002801228650000901256650001601265650001601281650000901297650002001306650001601326650001701342653001601359653001301375653000901388653001301397653001901410700001301429700001901442700001501461773009801476856008201574852000901656655001201665IND60704710020221121061810.0210320e20201001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070471002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lfs.2020.1181352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Qiuyuan14aThe cardinal roles of ferroportin and its partners in controlling cellular iron in and out  aNAL-light  aIn mammals, ferroportin (FPN) is the only known iron exporter, and it functions as a “water tap” in controlling iron absorption from the diet, iron egress from macrophages and other cells. However, its function is implemented not by itself but by a complex with many partners involved. In the current study, we elaborate on the direct partners in calibrating the capability of FPN in exporting iron out of cells, such as ceruloplasmin (CP), hephaestin (HP) and poly(rC)-binding protein 2 (PCBP2). We also recapitulate the current understandings of the regulation of FPN concentration at the post-transcriptional level. Considering the importance of FPN in finetuning iron homeostasis, a few therapeutic options are pursued to target FPN and its partners in treating iron diseases. Nonetheless, limited knowledge has been obtained on direct and indirect partners of FPN, so that more efforts should be invested including their therapeutic values.  aPublisher supplied data 3adiet 3aferroxidase 3ahomeostasis 3airon 3airon absorption 3amacrophages 3atherapeutics 0aFerroportin 0aPartners 0aRNAs 0aHepcidin 0aIron disorders1 aLiu, Wei1 aZhang, Shuping1 aLiu, Sijin0 tLife sciences.g2020 Oct. 01, v. 258 p.118135-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11720x0024-32057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2020.1181353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02683naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245011300155300002000268520128600288592002801574650002101602650002601623650001601649650002901665650002701694650002301721650002301744650002101767650001301788650002001801650001301821650001801834650001501852650002401867650001701891650001101908700001801919700001501937700001901952700001801971700001701989773012402006856007402130852000902204655001202213IND60664585320221122235051.0190912e20131111xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066458532DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ra42782j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Li Qun12aA poly(vinylidene fluoride)-graft-poly(dopamine acrylamide) copolymer for surface functionalizable membranes  ap. 25204-25214.  aPoly(dopamine acrylamide)-grafted poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF-g-PDA) microfiltration (MF) membranes were fabricated via (i) thermally-induced radical graft copolymerization of pentafluorophenyl acrylate from ozone-pretreated PVDF, (ii) reactive ester–amine reaction with dopamine hydrochloride, and (iii) membrane casting via phase inversion. The resulting catechol-containing PVDF-g-PDA MF membranes can be further functionalized via spontaneous reduction and chelating of Ag and Au nanoparticles on the surface, and via grafting of thiol-terminated poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG-SH), amino-terminated poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM-NH₂) or amino-terminated hyperbranched polyglycerol (HPG-NH₂) in Michael addition or Schiff base reactions. The as-synthesized PVDF-g-PDA/Ag nanoparticles composite MF membrane was explored for its antibacterial efficacy against Gram-negative Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus). The resulting PVDF-g-PDA/Au nanoparticles composite MF membrane was investigated as the catalytic support for the reduction of 4-hydroxynitrobenzene. The obtained PVDF-g-PDA/PNIPAM, PVDF-g-PDA/PEG and PVDF-g-PDA/HPG MF membranes exhibit thermo-responsive, biocompatible and anti-fouling properties, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aacrylamides 3aantibacterial properties 3aantifouling activities 3acatalytic activity 3acomposite polymers 3acopolymerization 3adopamine 3amicrofiltration 3ananogold 3ananoparticles 3ananosilver 3apolyethylene glycol 3aschiff bases 3asilver1 aChen, Jiu Cun1 aWang, Rong1 aNeoh, Koon-Gee1 aKang, En-Tang1 aFu, Guo Dong0 tRSC advances.g2013 Nov. 11, v. 3, no. 47 p.25204-25214dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3ra42782j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03385naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245016200157300001800319520173100337592002802068650002702096650001402123650002302137650001502160650002102175650001802196650001002214650002102224650000902245650001402254650001202268650001302280650001702293650001702310650001002327650001002337650002202347650001502369650001002384650002302394650002602417650002302443650001802466653001802484653001702502653001502519653002102534653001402555700002202569773014502591856007402736852000902810655001202819IND60679855020221122062050.0200102e20170302xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067985502DNAL7 a10.1093/jee/tox0452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEjaz, Masood10aSpirotetramat Resistance Selected in the Phenacoccus solenopsis (Homoptera: Pseudococcidae): Cross-Resistance Patterns, Stability, and Fitness Costs Analysis  ap. 1226-1234.  aThe Phenacoccus solenopsis Tinsley (Homoptera: Pseudococcidae) is a major agricultural and horticultural pest of crops throughout the world. To develop a better resistance management strategy for P. solenopsis, we conducted a study on life history parameters of different populations of this pest, one selected with spirotetramat (Spiro-SEL), an unselected (UNSEL) population, and their reciprocal crosses. We also studied the cross-resistance and the stability of spirotetramat resistance. The Spiro-SEL of P. solenopsis exhibited a 328.69-fold resistance compared to the susceptible population (Lab-PK). The Spiro-SEL population also displayed a moderate level of cross-resistance to profenofos and bifenthrin and a high level of cross-resistance to abamectin. Resistance to spirotetramat in Spiro-SEL was unstable in the absence of selection. The study of life history parameters showed that there was a significant reduction in fitness parameters of Spiro-SEL population with a relative fitness value of 0.14. There was a significant decrease in survival rate, pupal weight, fecundity, egg hatching percentage, male and female generation time, intrinsic rate of population increase of males and females, biotic potential, and mean relative growth rate. It is concluded that selection with spirotetramat had marked effect on resistance development in P. solenopsis and upon removal of selection pressure spirotetramat resistance declined significantly, indicating unstable resistance. Development of resistance led to high fitness costs for the spirotetramat-selected population. Our study may provide the basic information on spirotetramat resistance and its mechanism to help develop the resistance management strategies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhenacoccus solenopsis 3aabamectin 3aat-risk population 3abifenthrin 3abiotic potential 3acost analysis 3acrops 3across resistance 3aeggs 3afecundity 3afemales 3ahatching 3ahorticulture 3alife history 3amales 3apests 3apopulation growth 3aprofenofos 3apupae 3areciprocal crosses 3aresistance management 3aselection pressure 3asurvival rate 0aspirotetramat 0afitness cost 0aresistance 0across-resistance 0astability1 aShad, Sarfraz Ali0 tJournal of economic entomology.g2017 Mar. 2, v. 110, no. 3 p.1226-1234dEntomological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl46276x0022-04937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jee/tox0453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02762naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245018800171300001600359520112400375592002801499650002301527650001301550650002201563650001101585650002001596650001801616650002201634650001301656650001801669650002201687650001301709650001301722650002101735650001801756650001501774653004501789653001801834653004901852653003201901653002801933700001701961700001701978700001701995700001302012700001702025773010602042856008702148852000902235655001202244IND60571109620221119171333.0190409e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057110962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2017.05.1852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Shusong10aHeterotrophic nitrification and aerobic denitrification by Diaphorobacter polyhydroxybutyrativorans SL-205 using poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) as the sole carbon source  ap. 500-507.  aA new strain of Diaphorobacter polyhydroxybutyrativorans (strain SL-205) was recently isolated and identified. SL-205 can utilize nitrate and nitrite for denitrification and ammonium for nitrification using poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV) as the carbon source under aerobic conditions. SL-205 removed 99.11% of NH4+-derived N (83.90mg/L), 95.02% of NO3−–N (308.24mg/L), and 84.13% of NO2−–N (211.70mg/L), with average removal rates of 1.73mg NH4+–N/(L·h), 6.10mg NO3−–N/(L·h), and 4.95mg NO2−–N/(L·h). Nitrogen gas was the primary end-product, with negligible nitrous oxide accumulation during ammonium removal, accounting for 57.85% of the removed NH4+–N and 52.30% of the initial NH4+–N. Moreover, hydroxylamine oxidoreductase, nitrate reductase, and nitrite reductase were detected, further indicating that strain SL-205 underwent heterotrophic nitrification coupled with aerobic denitrification (NH4+→NH2OH→NO2−→NO3−→NO2−→N2O→N2). These results support the use of PHBV as a carbon source for nitrogen removal from water and wastewater by strain SL-205.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerobic conditions 3aammonium 3aammonium nitrogen 3acarbon 3adenitrification 3ahydroxylamine 3anitrate reductase 3anitrates 3anitrification 3anitrite reductase 3anitrites 3anitrogen 3anitrogen dioxide 3anitrous oxide 3awastewater 0aDiaphorobacter polyhydroxybutyrativorans 0aCarbon source 0aPoly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) 0aHeterotrophic nitrification 0aAerobic denitrification1 aSun, Xingbin1 aFan, Yueting1 aQiu, Tianlei1 aGao, Min1 aWang, Xuming0 tBioresource technology.g2017 Oct., v. 241 p.500-507dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2017.05.1853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03183naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001800145245017700163300001600340500002000356500001500376520158400391592002801975650001902003650002302022650002502045650001302070650001702083650001102100650001002111650001802121650001902139650002402158650001302182650002502195653001502220700001902235700002302254700001902277700001702296700002102313700002302334700002002357700002202377700006002399773013002459856007902589852000902668655001202677IND60598563020221118152909.0180629e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059856302DNAL7 a10.1111/1758-2229.126512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrafe, Martin10aBacterial potentials for uptake, solubilization and mineralization of extracellular phosphorus in agricultural soils are highly stable under different fertilization regimes  ap. 320-327.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  a2019-12-06  aPhosphorus is one of the most important macronutrient for plants. In agriculture, amending fertilizer with phosphorus (P) is common practice. However, natural phosphorus sources are finite, making research for more sustainable management practices necessary. We postulated that the addition of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) would stimulate phosphorus mobilization by bacteria because of their desire to maintain a stable intracellular C:N:P stoichiometry. Therefore, we chose a metagenomic approach to investigate two agricultural soils, which only received mineral N fertilizer or mineral N and organic fertilizer for more than 20 years. The most abundant genes involved in the acquisition of external P sources in our study were those involved in solubilization and subsequent uptake of inorganic phosphorus. Independent of site and season, the relative abundance of genes involved in P turnover was not significantly affected by the addition of fertilizers. However, the type of fertilization had a significant impact on the diversity pattern of bacterial families harbouring genes coding for the different P transformation processes. This gives rise to the possibility that fertilizers can substantially change phosphorus turnover efficiency by favouring different families. Additionally, none of the families involved in phosphorus turnover covered all investigated processes. Therefore, promoting bacteria which play an essential role specifically in mobilization of hardly accessible phosphorus could help to secure the phosphorus supply of plants in soils with low P input.  aPublisher supplied data 3amineralization 3aagricultural soils 3ainorganic phosphorus 3anitrogen 3ametagenomics 3acarbon 3agenes 3astoichiometry 3asolubilization 3aorganic fertilizers 3abacteria 3anitrogen fertilizers 0aphosphorus1 aGoers, Manuela1 avon Tucher, Sabine1 aBaum, Christel1 aZimmer, Dana1 aLeinweber, Peter1 aVestergaard, Gisle1 aKublik, Susanne1 aSchloter, Michael1 aSchulz, Stefanie1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5520-81060 tEnvironmental microbiology reports.g2018 June, v. 10, no. 3 p.320-327dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:2217x1758-22297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1758-2229.126513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01817naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245017600154300001800330520061300348592002800961650001600989650001401005650001301019650002001032650001301052650002101065650001501086650000901101650001301110650001101123650001301134700001501147700001701162700002801179773014101207856007401348852000901422655001201431IND60670692120221123030824.0191002e20140403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067069212DNAL7 a10.1039/c3tb21355b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Jing12aA metal-catalyst free, flexible and free-standing chitosan/vacuum-stripped graphene/polypyrrole three dimensional electrode interface for high performance dopamine sensing  ap. 2478-2482.  aA three dimensional chitosan/vacuum-stripped graphene/polypyrrole interface with a hierarchical porous structure was fabricated as a free-standing and flexible electrochemical sensing electrode for dopamine detection, which exhibits unprecedented good selectivity, high sensitivity (632.1 μA mM⁻¹ cm⁻²), wide linear response range (0.1–200 μM), low detection limit (19.4 nM, S/N = 3) and good sensing performance in human serum samples, outperforming the previously reported 2D and 3D graphene and/or the PPy modified electrode, and exhibiting comparable performance with the Au modified electrode.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood serum 3acatalysts 3achitosan 3adetection limit 3adopamine 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3agold 3agraphene 3ahumans 3apyrroles1 aHe, Ziming1 aXue, Jingwen1 aYang Tan, Timothy Thatt0 tJournal of materials chemistry B.g2014 Apr. 3, v. 2, no. 17 p.2478-2482dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26902x2050-75187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3tb21355b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03301naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002100144245013200165300001500297520167500312592002801987650001902015650002502034650001302059650000902072650001202081650002502093650001502118650001302133650002102146650001402167650002102181650001902202650002602221650001702247650002002264650001402284650001402298650002002312650001902332650002902351653003002380653002902410653002002439653002202459653001702481700002002498700001702518773013602535856007902671852000902750655001202759IND60779534220221118054016.0220609e20210416xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077953422DNAL7 a10.1139/CJSS-2020-00872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLévesque, Vicky10aSoil Mehlich-3-extractable elements as affected by the addition of biochars to a clay soil co-amended with or without a compost  ap. 97-107.  aBiochar has the potential to sequester carbon and mitigate greenhouse gas emissions, and it may also contribute nutrients for plant growth in temperate climates. Nutrient availability in biochar-amended soil was assessed in a 338 d incubation study. The clay soil prepared with 4% w/w (dry basis) compost or without compost, then amended with wood-based biochar made at different pyrolysis temperatures [maple bark (Acer saccharum) at 400 (M400), 550 (M550), and 700 °C (M700)] on a dry-rate basis of 5% (w/w). After moistening the soil mixture to 44% volumetric soil water content (equivalent to 70% water-filled pore space), soil mixtures were incubated in the dark at 22 °C. Soil was sampled at days 9, 16, 23, 44, 86, 23 170, and 338 of the incubation. Biochar amendment increased the Mehlich-3 phosphorus, potassium (K), magnesium, and copper concentrations, and reduced the Mehlich-3 aluminum and iron concentrations at each sampling date, and M400 had the most significant effect on Mehlich-3-extractable nutrient concentrations. Compost addition also increased the amounts of extractable nutrients. These results suggested that M400 and carbon-rich compost promoted microbial growth and mineralization in amended soil. In addition, soil mixed with compost and amended with biochar had more Mehlich-3-extractable K than when compost or biochar was applied alone, probably due to greater growth and activity of soil K-solubilizing microorganisms. Overall, our study indicated that co-application of wood-based biochar and compost could improve soil fertility in temperate regions by increasing the availability of most plant macronutrients and micronutrients.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcer saccharum 3aMehlich-3 phosphorus 3aaluminum 3abark 3abiochar 3acarbon sequestration 3aclay soils 3acomposts 3agreenhouse gases 3amagnesium 3amicrobial growth 3amineralization 3anutrient availability 3aplant growth 3aplant nutrition 3apotassium 3apyrolysis 3asoil amendments 3asoil fertility 3avolumetric water content 0aphosphorus extractability 0apotassium extractability 0asoil incubation 0asynergetic effect 0awood biochar1 aGagnon, Bernard1 aZiadi, Noura0 tCanadian journal of soil science.g2021 Apr. 16, v. 102, no. 1 p.97-107dCanadian Science PublishingwJournal:1934x1918-18417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1139/CJSS-2020-00873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03081naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001700145245018100162300001600343500002000359520163300379592002802012650002702040650002102067650001202088650001802100650002602118650001102144650001202155650001102167650000902178650002102187650001402208650002502222650003002247700002202277700001502299700002202314700002102336700006002357773013002417856007902547852000902626655001202635IND60598563220221118152846.0180629e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059856322DNAL7 a10.1111/1758-2229.126372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFrey, Jasmin10aTwo enzymes of the acetone degradation pathway of Desulfococcus biacutus: coenzyme B12‐dependent 2‐hydroxyisobutyryl‐CoA mutase and 3‐hydroxybutyryl‐CoA dehydrogenase  ap. 283-292.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aDegradation of acetone by the sulfate‐reducing bacterium Desulfococcus biacutus involves an acetone‐activation reaction different from that used by aerobic or nitrate‐reducing bacteria, because the small energy budget of sulfate‐reducing bacteria does not allow for major expenditures into ATP‐consuming carboxylation reactions. In the present study, an inducible coenzyme B₁₂‐dependent conversion of 2‐hydroxyisobutyryl‐CoA to 3‐hydroxybutyryl‐CoA was demonstrated in cell‐free extracts of acetone‐grown D. biacutus cells, together with a NAD⁺‐dependent oxidation of 3‐hydroxybutyryl‐CoA to acetoacetyl‐CoA. Genes encoding two mutase subunits and a dehydrogenase, which were found previously to be strongly induced during growth with acetone, were heterologously expressed in E. coli. The activities of the purified recombinant proteins matched with the inducible activities observed in cell‐free extracts of acetone‐grown D. biacutus: proteins (IMG locus tags) DebiaDRAFT_04573 and 04574 constituted a B₁₂‐dependent 2‐hydroxyisobutyryl‐CoA/3‐hydroxybutyryl‐CoA mutase, and DebiaDRAFT_04571 was a 3‐hydroxybutyryl‐CoA dehydrogenase. Hence, these enzymes play key roles in the degradation of acetone and define an involvement of CoA esters in the pathway. Further, the involvement of 2‐hydroxyisobutyryl‐CoA strongly indicates that the carbonyl‐C₂ of acetone is added, most likely, to formyl‐CoA through a TDP‐dependent enzyme that is co‐induced in acetone‐grown cells and is encoded in the same gene cluster as the identified mutase and dehydrogenase.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDesulfococcus biacutus 3aEscherichia coli 3aacetone 3acarboxylation 3adenitrifying bacteria 3aenergy 3aenzymes 3aesters 3aloci 3amultigene family 3aoxidation 3arecombinant proteins 3asulfate-reducing bacteria1 aSchneider, Fabian1 aHuhn, Tom,1 aSpiteller, Dieter1 aSchink, Bernhard1 aSchleheck, David1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1327-41610 tEnvironmental microbiology reports.g2018 June, v. 10, no. 3 p.283-292dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:2217x1758-22297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1758-2229.126373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02851naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002600145245014000171300001600311520140000327592002801727650001101755650002601766650001401792650001401806650001301820650002601833650002401859650001201883650001301895650001001908650001501918650001101933650001001944650001101954650001001965650001801975650002201993650002102015700002302036700002102059700002302080773019002103856007902293852000902372655001202381IND50089403920221120052653.0150218e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008940392DNAL7 a10.1111/1574-6941.123022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcFrederick, Quinn S.10aHost species and developmental stage, but not host social structure, affects bacterial community structure in socially polymorphic bees  ap. 398-406.  aSocial transmission and host developmental stage are thought to profoundly affect the structure of bacterial communities associated with honey bees and bumble bees, but these ideas have not been explored in other bee species. The halictid bees Megalopta centralis and M. genalis exhibit intrapopulation social polymorphism, which we exploit to test whether bacterial communities differ by host social structure, developmental stage, or host species. We collected social and solitary Megalopta nests and sampled bees and nest contents from all stages of host development. To survey these bacterial communities, we used 16S rRNA gene 454 pyrosequencing. We found no effect of social structure, but found differences by host species and developmental stage. Wolbachia prevalence differed between the two host species. Bacterial communities associated with different developmental stages appeared to be driven by environmentally acquired bacteria. A Lactobacillus kunkeei clade bacterium that is consistently associated with other bee species was dominant in pollen provisions and larval samples, but less abundant in mature larvae and pupae. Foraging adults appeared to often reacquire L. kunkeei clade bacteria, likely while foraging at flowers. Environmental transmission appears to be more important than social transmission for Megalopta bees at the cusp between social and solitary behavior.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBombus 3aLactobacillus kunkeei 3aMegalopta 3aWolbachia 3abacteria 3abacterial communities 3acommunity structure 3aflowers 3aforaging 3agenes 3ahoney bees 3alarvae 3anests 3apollen 3apupae 3aribosomal RNA 3asequence analysis 3asocial structure1 aWcislo, William T.1 aHout, Michael C.1 aMueller, Ulrich G.0 tFEMS microbiology ecology.g2014 May, v. 88, no. 2 p.398-406dPublished by Elsevier Science Publishers on behalf of the Federation of European Microbiological Societiesx0168-64967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1574-6941.123023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01822naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002600140245015900166300001800325500001900343520050500362592002800867650001400895650001800909650001400927650001200941650002000953650001900973650001900992650001801011650001101029650001901040650002301059700003001082700002901112700003101141700002401172773013301196856007401329852000901403655001201412IND60729784420221117235150.0210302e20210301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072978442DNAL7 a10.1039/d0cc01542c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBuarque, Filipe Smith10aDevelopment of an ethanolic two-phase system (ETPS) based on polypropylene glycol 2000 + ethylene glycol + ethanol for separation of hydrophobic compounds  ap. 2156-2159.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis work reports, for the first time, an Ethanolic Two-Phase System (ETPS) based on polypropylene glycol 2000 (PPG 2000), mono-, di-, tri-ethylene glycol, and ethanol.

Coupled with media-driven public perception, a paradigm has evolved in which the global ocean ecosystems are thought to he heading toward being dominated by “nuisance” jellyfish. We question this current paradigm by presenting a broad overview of gelatinous Zooplankton in a historical context to develop the hypothesis that population changes reflect the human-mediated alteration of global ocean ecosystems. To this end, we synthesize information related to the evolutionary context of contemporary gelatinous Zooplankton blooms, the human frame of reference for changes in gelatinous Zooplankton populations, and whether sufficient data are available to have established the paradigm. We conclude that the current paradigm in which it is believed that there has been a global increase in gelatinous Zooplankton is unsubstantiated, and we develop a strategy for addressing the critical questions about long-term, human-related changes in the sea as they relate to gelatinous Zooplankton blooms.  aPublisher supplied data 0abloom 0amedia 0ajellyfish 0asalp 0aglobal synthesis1 aGraham, William M.1 aDuarte, Carlos M.1 aPitt, Kylie A.1 aLucas, Cathy H.1 aHaddock, Steven H.D.1 aSutherland, Kelly R.1 aRobinson, Kelly L.1 aDawson, Michael N1 aDecker, Mary Beth1 aMills, Claudia E.1 aPurcell, J.

They consist of networks of interconnected nests with hundreds of reproductive queens, where individuals move freely between nests, cooperate across nest boundaries and show little aggression towards non‐nestmates. The combination of high queen numbers and free mixing of workers, queens and brood between nests results in extremely low nestmate relatedness. In such low‐relatedness societies, cooperative worker behaviour appears maladaptive because it may aid random individuals instead of relatives. Here, we provide a comprehensive picture of genetic substructure in supercolonies of the native wood ant Formica aquilonia using traditional population genetic as well as network analysis methods. Specifically, we test for spatial and temporal variation in genetic structure of different classes of individuals within supercolonies and analyse the role of worker movement in determining supercolony genetic networks. We find that relatedness within supercolonies is low but positive when viewed on a population level, which may be due to limited dispersal of individuals and/or ecological factors such as nest site limitation and competition against conspecifics. Genetic structure of supercolonies varied with both sample class and sampling time point, which indicates that mobility of individuals varies according to both caste and season and suggests that generalizing has to be carried out with caution in studies of supercolonial species. Overall, our analysis provides novel evidence that native wood ant supercolonies exhibit fine‐scale genetic substructure, which may explain the maintenance of cooperation in these low‐relatedness societies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFormica aquilonia 3aaggression 3aenvironmental factors 3anesting sites 3anests 3atemporal variation1 aSaramäki, Jari,1 aHelanterä, Heikki0 tMolecular ecology.g2016 Dec., v. 25, no. 24 p.6196-6213dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0962-10837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mec.139123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01920naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245005600173300001600229520095900245592002801204650002201232650001101254650000901265650001301274650001401287650001601301700002201317700002301339700001901362700002001381773008701401856008501488852000901573655001201582IND60628089120221120210229.0190502e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062808912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2018.12.1072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFauchard, Mélissa10aOverview on the intercalation of gold into graphite  ap. 501-506.  aThe intercalation of gold into graphite has been achieved thanks to a solid-liquid method using potassium metal-based molten alloys. Numerous syntheses have been performed varying the reactive alloy composition, the reaction temperature and the reaction time. The optimization of these parameters allowed to synthesize three novel ternary graphite intercalation compounds (GIC) containing poly-layered intercalated sheets, called alpha, beta and gamma. Thanks to a specific X-Ray diffraction study, the c-axis stacking sequence of the three compounds was determined. The α-GIC, which is a metastable compound, contains mixed potassium and gold two-layered intercalated sheets. The β-GIC and γ-GIC contain very thick well ordered three-layered and five-layered sheets respectively. The very high repeat distances of the latter compounds are clearly explained by the amount of intercalated metals, precisely determined using nuclear microprobe analyses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aalloys 3agold 3agraphene 3apotassium 3atemperature1 aCahen, Sébastien1 aLagrange, Philippe1 aBerger, Pascal1 aHérold, Claire0 tCarbon.g2019 Apr., v. 145 p.501-506dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2018.12.1073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03168naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002200145245013200167300001600299520153900315592002801854650001801882650002101900650000801921650001601929650001701945650002101962650001301983650002601996650002402022650004402046650001602090650001002106650001402116650001302130650004302143650001602186650001802202650001002220650002202230650000902252650001102261650002502272650001902297650001102316700002002327700002102347700001902368700002102387700001702408700002802425773008202453856004602535852000902581655001202590IND50089404020221120052740.0140507e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008940402DNAL7 a10.1111/1574-6941.123132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarques, Joana M.10aPlant age and genotype affect the bacterial community composition in the tuber rhizosphere of field‐grown sweet potato plants  ap. 424-435.  aThe hypothesis that sweet potato genotypes containing different starch yields in their tuberous roots can affect the bacterial communities present in the rhizosphere (soil adhering to tubers) was tested in this study. Tuberous roots of field‐grown sweet potato of genotypes IPB‐149 (commercial genotype), IPB‐052, and IPB‐137 were sampled three and six months after planting and analyzed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and pyrosequencing analysis of 16S rRNA genes PCR‐amplified from total community DNA. The statistical analysis of the DGGE fingerprints showed that both plant age and genotypes influenced the bacterial community structure in the tuber rhizosphere. Pyrosequencing analysis showed that the IPB‐149 and IPB‐052 (both with high starch content) displayed similar bacterial composition in the tuber rhizosphere, while IPB‐137 with the lowest starch content was distinct. In comparison with bulk soil, higher 16S rRNA gene copy numbers (qPCR) and numerous genera with significantly increased abundance in the tuber rhizosphere of IPB‐137 (Sphingobium, Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, Stenotrophomonas, Chryseobacterium) indicated a stronger rhizosphere effect. The genus Bacillus was strongly enriched in the tuber rhizosphere samples of all sweet potato genotypes studied, while other genera showed a plant genotype‐dependent abundance. This is the first report on the molecular identification of bacteria being associated with the tuber rhizosphere of different sweet potato genotypes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcinetobacter 3aChryseobacterium 3aDNA 3aPseudomonas 3aSphingomonas 3aStenotrophomonas 3abacteria 3abacterial communities 3acommunity structure 3adenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis 3agene dosage 3agenes 3aplant age 3aplanting 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arhizosphere 3aribosomal RNA 3aroots 3asequence analysis 3asoil 3astarch 3astatistical analysis 3asweet potatoes 3atubers1 aSilva, Thais F.1 aVollu, Renata E.1 aBlank, Arie F.1 aDing, Guo‐Chun1 aSeldin, Lucy1 aSmalla, K.q(Kornelia),0 tFEMS microbiology ecology.g2014 May, v. 88, no. 2 p.424-435x0168-64967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1574-6941.12313  aDNAL 7aarticle03417naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002900140245013400169300001800303520178000321592002802101650001002129650002802139650001102167650001902178650001002197650001502207650002002222650002402242650001502266651001102281651001002292651002902302651001002331653001602341653002202357653002102379700003102400700001702431700001902448700001902467700002502486700003002511700002902541700003302570700003002603700002502633773014602658856007402804852000902878655001202887IND60679855420221122123656.0200102e20170314xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067985542DNAL7 a10.1093/jee/tox0502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAthanassiou, Christos G.10aEvaluation of Pheromone Trap Devices for the Capture of Thaumetopoea pityocampa (Lepidoptera: Thaumetopoeidae) in Southern Europe  ap. 1087-1095.  aThe development of reliable monitoring techniques can offer valuable sources of knowledge on the control of Thaumetopoea pityocampa (Denis and Schiffermüller) (Lepidoptera: Thaumetopoeidae). Nevertheless, there is a knowledge gap on the simultaneous large-scale monitoring of T. pityocampa male adult population by using novel trap devices. Thus, the influence of type of trap device on the capture of male adults of T. pityocampa was evaluated in four areas with pine trees in southern Europe; two in Greece (Thessaly and Attica), one in Italy (Molise), and one in Spain (Valencia). Six different novel trap devices, i.e., Prototype 1, Prototype 2, Prototype 3, Prototype 4, Prototype 5, and Prototype 6, were tested during 2015 between July and November. In general, the male adult catches lasted longer in the two sites of Greece compared with Molise and Valencia. Hence, in Thessaly, captures started in early August and remained at high levels until late September. In Attica, captures started in mid-August and lasted until early November. In contrast, for both Molise and Valencia, most of the male adults were captured in August, while male adult catches were recorded until September. From the trap devices tested, Prototype 1 was found superior than the other devices, regardless of the area, with the exception of Valencia, where there were no differences in the overall captures among Prototype 1, Prototype 5, and Prototype 6. In most of the combinations tested, there was a positive and significant correlation among captures of T. pityocampa in pairs of different trap devices, indicating that most of them gave similar population fluctuations. Our results suggest that Prototype 1 should be selected for the monitoring of T. pityocampa male adult population.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus 3aThaumetopoea pityocampa 3aimagos 3ainsect control 3amales 3amonitoring 3apheromone traps 3apopulation dynamics 3aprototypes 3aGreece 3aItaly 3aSouthern European region 3aSpain 0atrap device 0aimproved trapping 0amale adult catch1 aKavallieratos, Nickolas G.1 aPardo, David1 aSancho, José,1 aColacci, Marco1 aBoukouvala, Maria C.1 aNikolaidou, Anastassia J.1 aKondodimas, Demetrius C.1 aBenavent-Fernández, Enrique1 aGálvez-Settier, Santiago1 aTrematerra, Pasquale0 tJournal of economic entomology.g2017 Mar. 14, v. 110, no. 3 p.1087-1095dEntomological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl46276x0022-04937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jee/tox0503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02467naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245008300158520163300241592002801874650001901902650001101921650002501932650001101957700002001968773012901988856007502117852000902192655001202201IND60784189320221120041158.0220726e20220714xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078418932DNAL7 a10.3390/rs141433822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYao, Junyuan 10aMulti-Category Segmentation of Sentinel-2 Images Based on the Swin UNet Method  aMedium-resolution remote sensing satellites have provided a large amount of long time series and full coverage data for Earth surface monitoring. However, the different objects may have similar spectral values and the same objects may have different spectral values, which makes it difficult to improve the classification accuracy. Semantic segmentation of remote sensing images is greatly facilitated via deep learning methods. For medium-resolution remote sensing images, the convolutional neural network-based model does not achieve good results due to its limited field of perception. The fast-emerging vision transformer method with self-attentively capturing global features well provides a new solution for medium-resolution remote sensing image segmentation. In this paper, a new multi-class segmentation method is proposed for medium-resolution remote sensing images based on the improved Swin UNet model as a pure transformer model and a new pre-processing, and the image enhancement method and spectral selection module are designed to achieve better accuracy. Finally, 10-categories segmentation is conducted with 10-m resolution Sentinel-2 MSI (Multi-Spectral Imager) images, which is compared with other traditional convolutional neural network-based models (DeepLabV3+ and U-Net with different backbone networks, including VGG, ResNet50, MobileNet, and Xception) with the same sample data, and results show higher Mean Intersection Over Union (MIOU) (72.06%) and better accuracy (89.77%) performance. The vision transformer method has great potential for medium-resolution remote sensing image segmentation tasks.  aPublisher supplied data 3aimage analysis 3amodels 3atime series analysis 3avision1 aJin, Shuanggen 0 tRemote Sensing.g2022 July 14, v. 14, no. 14dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs141433823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02487naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245013800168300001600306500001900322520108000341592002801421650004401449650001301493650001401506650002001520650001401540650001901554650002401573650002401597653001901621653002901640653001601669653002201685653002401707700001501731700001401746700001801760700001701778700001501795773013501810856008701945852000902032655001202041IND60724168120221120113528.0210219e20210301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072416812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2021.01.0442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Qian10aDevelopment of soy protein isolate/κ-carrageenan composite hydrogels as a delivery system for hydrophilic compounds: Monascus yellow  ap. 281-288.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe aim of the present study was to develop soy protein isolate (SPI) and κ-carrageenan (KC) composite hydrogels as a delivery system for hydrophilic compounds. The pigment of monascus yellow was used as a model. A systematic study was performed to characterize the rheological, textural, microstructural properties and in vitro digestion release profile of monascus yellow of the composite gels. The results of power law modeling, electrophoresis patterns and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) confirmed that non-covalent interactions were involved in the formation of SPI/KC composite hydrogels. Compared to pure κ-carrageenan hydrogels, the incorporation of SPI could promote the formation of tougher, more uniform and compact composite gels with sustained-release property. In addition, the release behaviors of monascus yellow entrapped in the hydrogel network can be well described by the Ritger-Peppas mathematical model. Overall, our study provided a promising strategy to enhance the sustained release performance of hydrogels in digestive conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aMonascus 3adigestion 3aelectrophoresis 3ahydrogels 3ahydrophilicity 3amathematical models 3asoy protein isolate 0aκ-Carrageenan 0aWater-soluble substances 0aEncapsulate 0aSustained release 0aSimulated digestion1 aGu, Luping1 aSu, Yujie1 aChang, Cuihua1 aYang, Yanjun1 aLi, Junhua0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2021 Mar. 01, v. 172 p.281-288dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2021.01.0443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03376naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002900139245009300168300001800261500002000279520180400299592002802103650001902131650001902150650002802169650001102197650001702208650001202225650001802237650001502255650002002270650002502290650001402315650001002329650002502339650003402364650000902398650002102407650001402428650002702442650002502469650003102494650002202525650002002547650002902567650001302596700002302609700001802632773010202650856007302752852000902825655001202834IND60572217120221120204503.0170712e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057221712DNAL7 a10.1111/mec.139162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMohd‐Assaad, Norfarhan10aMultilocus resistance evolution to azole fungicides in fungal plant pathogen populations  ap. 6124-6142.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aEvolution of fungicide resistance is a major threat to food production in agricultural ecosystems. Fungal pathogens rapidly evolved resistance to all classes of fungicides applied to the field. Resistance to the commonly used azole fungicides is thought to be driven mainly by mutations in a gene (CYP51) encoding a protein of the ergosterol biosynthesis pathway. However, some fungi gained azole resistance independently of CYP51 mutations and the mechanisms leading to CYP51‐independent resistance are poorly understood. We used whole‐genome sequencing and genome‐wide association studies (GWAS) to perform an unbiased screen of azole resistance loci in Rhynchosporium commune, the causal agent of the barley scald disease. We assayed cyproconazole resistance in 120 isolates collected from nine populations worldwide. We found that mutations in highly conserved genes encoding the vacuolar cation channel YVC1, a transcription activator, and a saccharopine dehydrogenase made significant contributions to fungicide resistance. These three genes were not previously known to confer resistance in plant pathogens. However, YVC1 is involved in a conserved stress response pathway known to respond to azoles in human pathogenic fungi. We also performed GWAS to identify genetic polymorphism linked to fungal growth rates. We found that loci conferring increased fungicide resistance were negatively impacting growth rates, suggesting that fungicide resistance evolution imposed costs. Analyses of population structure showed that resistance mutations were likely introduced into local populations through gene flow. Multilocus resistance evolution to fungicides shows how pathogen populations can evolve a complex genetic architecture for an important phenotypic trait within a short time span.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRhynchosporium 3aagroecosystems 3aanimal pathogenic fungi 3abarley 3abiosynthesis 3acations 3acyproconazole 3aergosterol 3afood production 3afungicide resistance 3agene flow 3agenes 3agenetic polymorphism 3agenome-wide association study 3aloci 3amicrobial growth 3aphenotype 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3apopulation structure 3asaccharopine dehydrogenase 3asequence analysis 3astress response 3atranscription (genetics) 3avacuoles1 aMcDonald, Bruce A.1 aCroll, Daniel0 tMolecular ecology.g2016 Dec., v. 25, no. 24 p.6124-6142dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0962-10837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mec.139163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03201naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100006100153245009400214520168300308592002801991650001502019650002002034650001402054650001902068650001602087650001202103650001402115650001202129650002502141650001602166650002402182650001802206650001802224650001402242650002502256650001102281653002502292653002102317653003202338653001902370700003102389700002202420700006002442773012002502856008802622852000902710655001202719IND60713948220221123023521.0210428e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071394822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.resconrec.2020.1051652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPatrício, João,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4994-773510aTop-down method and databases for typical product demands of 103 manufacturing industries  aA top-down method for identifying product inputs to industries at product level is presented.

The first database shows frequency for a given product import by an industry; the second database shows the relative magnitude of product demand compared to the total amount of products imported by the industry. The frequency database depicts stability of a given product demand while the magnitude database identifies core products. The study was performed for Swedish imports. An upscaling evaluation was tested with Swedish exports and Portuguese imports data sets. It was found that industries have similar frequency of product demand, regardless of the country they are located in. Import magnitudes were found to have more dependence on the country for which data was collected. Nevertheless, when aggregated into major products groups, industrial product consumption is very similar in the two countries studied. One possible application of the databases developed in this study could be identification of new opportunities for industrial symbiosis among all industries operating in a region. Collated raw material inputs by industry are available in the databases, allowing industries which could potentially receive byproducts and wastes from elsewhere to be determined, without the need for direct contact between different actors.  aPublisher supplied data 3abyproducts 3adata collection 3adatabases 3adirect contact 3aexhibitions 3aexports 3afrequency 3aimports 3aindustrial symbiosis 3ainformation 3ainternational trade 3amanufacturing 3araw materials 3arecycling 3atime series analysis 3awastes 0aIndustrial symbiosis 0aCircular economy 0aIndustrial waste generation 0aProduct inputs1 aEncarnacion, Divia Jimenez1 aKalmykova, Yuliya1 aRosado, Leonardo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1674-67850 tResources, conservation, and recycling.g2021 Jan., v. 164 p.105165-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11928x0921-34497nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2020.1051653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02145naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245009800170300001400268520097000282592002801252650002301280650001301303650001601316650002001332650001701352650001201369650002701381650002301408650001301431650001801444650000901462700001701471700001201488700005601500773010801556856008601664852000901750655001201759IND60612097220221118132644.0190705e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061209722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.idairyj.2018.05.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTarazanova, M.10aInfluence of lactococcal surface properties on cell retention and distribution in cheese curd  ap. 73-78.  aDuring cheese manufacturing, on average 90% of the starter culture cells are believed to be entrapped in the curd, with the remainder lost in whey. This paper shows that plasmid-cured dairy strains of Lactococcus lactis show cell retention in the curd of 30–72%, whereas over-expression of pili on the lactococcal cell surface can increase cell retention to 99%. Exopolysaccharide production and cell clumping and chaining do not influence cell retention in cheese curd. L. lactis surface alteration also strongly affected the distribution of cells in the cheese matrix: clumping and over-expression of pili led to formation of large cell aggregates embedded in the protein matrix whereas exopolysaccharide expression resulted in cells being surrounding by small serum regions in the protein matrix of the cheese. These results suggest that surface properties of dairy starter cultures strongly determine retention and distribution of the bacteria in cheese curd.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLactococcus lactis 3abacteria 3ablood serum 3acell aggregates 3acheesemaking 3acheeses 3acultured milk starters 3aexopolysaccharides 3afimbriae 3amanufacturing 3awhey1 aHuppertz, T.1 aKok, J.1 aBachmann, H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8224-09930 tInternational dairy journal.g2018 Oct., v. 85 p.73-78dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48777x0958-69467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.idairyj.2018.05.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02623naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005300150245015800203300001200361520139200373592002801765650001801793650002501811650003001836650001101866650001601877650001301893650001801906650001901924650001201943650002101955650002501976700005302001700001802054773008302072856008502155852000902240655001202249IND60628089320221122050537.0190502e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062808932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2018.12.1092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Jun1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7118-499210aX3N (X=C and Si) monolayers and their van der Waals Heterostructures with graphene and h-BN: Emerging tunable electronic structures by strain engineering  ap. 1-9.  aUsing density functional theory, we explore the electronic structures of the two-dimensional (2D) C3N and Si3N, as well as C3N-based van der Waals heterostructures with graphene and h-BN. The two-dimensional (2D) C3N is demonstrated to be an indirect semiconductor with atomically flat nanostructure, while the 2D buckled Si3N exhibits metallic property. The semiconductor-metal transition can be obtained under compressive strain of −8% and tensile strain of 14% for the 2D C3N, and the metal-semiconductor transition can be achieved when 10% stretch strain is applied for the Si3N. Moreover, the C3NBN heterojunctions with three different stackings are energetically favorable based on the formation energy analysis. The Dirac-like point of C3N is broken as the interlayer distance is decreased, and the band alignments of the C3NBN heterojunctions are significantly affected by the external strains. In contrast, both AA- and AB-stacked C3N-graphene heterojunctions possess excellent Ohmic contact. The p-type Ohmic contact of the AA stacking can be switched to the n-type provided that the vertical distance is substantially decreased. The tunable electronic properties of the 2D C3N and the comprehensive understanding of C3N-based van der Waals heterostructures influenced by strain engineering may facilitate their practical applications for nanoelectronics and optoelectronics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aboron nitride 3acompression strength 3adensity functional theory 3aenergy 3aengineering 3agraphene 3ananomaterials 3asemiconductors 3asilicon 3atensile strength 3avan der Waals forces1 aZeng, Hui1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7657-67141 aZhou, Xingfei0 tCarbon.g2019 Apr., v. 145 p.1-9dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2018.12.1093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02570naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002600145245009700171300001600268520144500284592002801729650002201757650001301779650001401792650002001806650002101826650001401847650000901861650001601870650001401886700002101900700002101921773019001942856007902132852000902211655001202220IND50089404120221120052742.0150218e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008940412DNAL7 a10.1111/1574-6941.122902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSantander, Ricardo D.10aCellular, physiological, and molecular adaptive responses of Erwinia amylovora to starvation  ap. 258-271.  aErwinia amylovora causes fire blight, a destructive disease of rosaceous plants distributed worldwide. This bacterium is a nonobligate pathogen able to survive outside the host under starvation conditions, allowing its spread by various means such as rainwater. We studied E. amylovora responses to starvation using water microcosms to mimic natural oligotrophy. Initially, survivability under optimal (28 °C) and suboptimal (20 °C) growth temperatures was compared. Starvation induced a loss of culturability much more pronounced at 28 °C than at 20 °C. Natural water microcosms at 20 °C were then used to characterize cellular, physiological, and molecular starvation responses of E. amylovora. Challenged cells developed starvation‐survival and viable but nonculturable responses, reduced their size, acquired rounded shapes and developed surface vesicles. Starved cells lost motility in a few days, but a fraction retained flagella. The expression of genes related to starvation, oxidative stress, motility, pathogenicity, and virulence was detected during the entire experimental period with different regulation patterns observed during the first 24 h. Further, starved cells remained as virulent as nonstressed cells. Overall, these results provide new knowledge on the biology of E. amylovora under conditions prevailing in nature, which could contribute to a better understanding of the life cycle of this pathogen.  aPublisher supplied data 3aErwinia amylovora 3abacteria 3aflagellum 3agene expression 3aoxidative stress 3apathogens 3arain 3atemperature 3avirulence1 aOliver, James D.1 aBiosca, Elena G.0 tFEMS microbiology ecology.g2014 May, v. 88, no. 2 p.258-271dPublished by Elsevier Science Publishers on behalf of the Federation of European Microbiological Societiesx0168-64967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1574-6941.122903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03103naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245015400170300001600324520175300340592002802093650001102121650002202132650002902154650002102183650001602204651001602220653003502236653004602271653002702317653004202344653002302386653002002409700001702429700001902446700002002465700001502485773009702500856008702597852000902684655001202693IND60566052620221120031044.0180830e20170515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056605262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.07.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHong, Taehoon10aDevelopment of a method for estimating the rooftop solar photovoltaic (PV) potential by analyzing the available rooftop area using Hillshade analysis  ap. 320-332.  aThe solar photovoltaic (PV) system is known as one of the most outstanding new renewable energy systems for achieving the nearly zero energy building (nZEB). For the continuous deployment of the solar PV system in urban environments, it is crucial to estimate the rooftop solar PV potential. Urban areas, however, where high-rise buildings abound, are not always suitable for solar PV installation. Therefore, it is important to accurately estimate the available rooftop area considering the shadows from the surrounding buildings for reliable rooftop solar PV potential estimation. Therefore, this study proposed a method for estimating the rooftop solar PV potential by analyzing the available rooftop area through Hillshade analysis. Toward this end, the rooftop solar PV potential was estimated through the following hierarchical process: (i) calculation of the physical potential; (ii) calculation of the geographic potential; and (iii) calculation of the technical potential. For accurate estimation of the rooftop solar PV potential, the geographic potential (i.e., the available rooftop area) was explored in detail by analyzing the shadow based on the location of the sun through Hillshade analysis. By applying the proposed method to the Gangnam district in Seoul, South Korea, this study estimated the physical, geographic, and technical potentials on hourly, monthly, and annual bases. Overall, the physical, geographic, and technical potentials in the Gangnam district were found to be 9,287,982MWh, 4,964,118m², and 1,130,371MWh, respectively. These rooftop solar PV potential results can be used in establishing solar policies by analyzing the different levels of the rooftop solar PV potential on hourly, monthly, and annual bases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy 3aissues and policy 3arenewable energy sources 3asolar collectors 3aurban areas 3aSouth Korea 0aSolar photovoltaic (PV) system 0aRooftop solar photovoltaic (PV) potential 0aAvailable rooftop area 0aGeographical information system (GIS) 0aHillshade analysis 0aBuilding shadow1 aLee, Minhyun1 aKoo, Choongwan1 aJeong, Kwangbok1 aKim, Jimin0 tApplied energy.g2017 May 15, v. 194 p.320-332dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.07.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02835naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100001500169245011900184300001600303520090600319592002801225650003101253650001001284650001101294650001301305650001101318650002501329650002401354650001501378650001701393650001301410650002601423650002101449650003601470650004301506650001101549650005801560650002601618650002301644650004901667650004601716650003901762650003601801650002401837650003301861700001701894700001701911700001601928700001501944700001601959700001901975700001301994773009802007856008402105990002302189852000902212655001202221IND60092064020221120083154.0141103e20110428xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009206402DNAL7 a213207462pmid7 a10.1016/j.canlet.2011.01.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Min10aStem cell factor/c-kit signaling enhances invasion of pancreatic cancer cells via HIF-1α under normoxic condition  ap. 108-117.  aThe SCF/c-kit signaling plays an important role in invasion of c-kit-expressing tumor cells, however, the molecular mechanisms have not been studied yet. Using a pancreatic cancer model, we demonstrate that SCF/c-kit binding up-regulates the expression of invasion-related genes through the accumulation of HIF-1α. Furthermore, the expression of HIF-1α induced by SCF is not dependent on the oxygen level, but rather on both the PI3K/Akt and Ras/MEK/ERK signaling pathways. In conclusion, under normoxic conditions, SCF/c-kit binding increases expression of HIF-1α through the PI3K/Akt and Ras/MEK/ERK pathways, and the accumulation of HIF-1α up-regulates expression of invasion-related genes that augment the invasiveness of pancreatic cancer, a fatal cancer. Therefore, our results suggest that the inhibition of both c-kit and HIF-1α may be an effective strategy for pancreatic cancer therapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3amodels 3anormoxia 3aoxygen 3apancreatic neoplasms 3asignal transduction 3astem cells 3atherapeutics 2aHypoxia. 2aAntineoplastic Agents 2aCell Line, Tumor 2aEnzyme Inhibitorsxpharmacology 2aGene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic 2aHumans 2aHypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunitxmetabolism 2aNeoplasm Invasiveness 2aOxygenxmetabolism 2aPancreatic Neoplasmsxmetabolismxpathology. 2aProto-Oncogene Proteins c-kitxmetabolism 2aRNA, Small Interferingxmetabolism 2aRecombinant Proteinsxchemistry 2aSignal Transduction 2aStem Cell Factorxmetabolism1 aMa, Qingyong1 aHu, Hengtong1 aZhang, Dong1 aLi, Junhui1 aMa, Guodong1 aBhat, Kruttika1 aWu, Erxi0 tCancer letters.g2011 Apr. 28, v. 303, no. 2 p.108-117dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0304-38357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.canlet.2011.01.0173Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02810naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002800125040001800153100001600171245011800187300001800305520153300323592002801856596004501884650002201929650002301951650001401974650002401988650002402012650001202036650002402048653002202072653003302094653002102127653002602148700002002174773014602194856007502340852000902415655001202424IND60679855620221122131118.0200102e20170330xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067985562DNAL7 a10.1093/jee/tox0532chorus7 a10.1093/jee/tox0532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVail, K.

Early detection is key to slowing their spread, and reducing management cost and time needed for control. To determine the minimum number of passive monitors needed to detect low-level bed bug infestations in this environment, we evaluated three monitors placed one, two, or four per apartment in a 3 by 3 experimental design. One sticky monitor, The Bedbug Detection System, and the two pitfall monitors, ClimbUp Insect Interceptors BG and BlackOut BedBug Detectors, were evaluated. Bed bugs were trapped by the ClimbUp Insect Interceptors BG and the BlackOut BedBug Detector in 88% and 79% of apartments, respectively, but only in 39% of the apartments monitored with The Bedbug Detection System. The Bedbug Detection System required significantly longer time to detect bed bugs than either the ClimbUp Insect Interceptor BG or the BlackOut BedBug Detector. With the less effective Bedbug Detection System data removed from analyses, detection rates ranged from 80 to 90%, with no significant differences among one, two, or four monitors per apartment. Results indicate it is especially important to include a bed placement when only placing a few monitors.

A novel chitosan-based adsorbent (CS-GTU) was successfully synthesized by using formaldehyde as a crosslinker between chitosan and guanylthiourea, and applied for selective adsorption of Auᴵᴵᴵ from an aqueous medium. Through batch experiments, the maximum adsorption capacity of CS-GTU for Auᴵᴵᴵ could reach up to 695.63 mg/g at pH 5.0, and the adsorption process followed the Pseudo-second-order kinetic and Langmuir isotherm models, indicating that the monolayer chemisorption possibly occurred on the adsorbent surfaces. The adsorption was an enthalpy driven and spontaneous chemical process based on thermodynamic analysis. Furthermore, the adsorbent has demonstrated outstanding selectivity toward Auᴵᴵᴵ from multi-metallic solutions, and five cycled experiments of adsorption-desorption showed that CS-GTU could be efficiently regenerated. Experimental breakthrough curves were successfully simulated by using the Thomas model, which can fit the experimental data with the correlated curve (R² > 0.9) well. This improvement in adsorption was a consequence of the complexation and electrostatic attraction of gold ions with the abundant sulfur/nitrogen-containing groups. The CS-GTU beads can be considered as a suitable and efficient adsorbent for gold ions in aqueous solutions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3achitosan 3aeconomic valuation 3aelectrostatic interactions 3aenthalpy 3aformaldehyde 3agold 3amodels 3apH 3asorption isotherms 3awastewater 0aGold ions1 aLi, Xiteng1 aHuang, Zhen1 aWang, Shixing1 aZhang, Libo0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2021 Mar. 01, v. 172 p.210-222dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2021.01.0463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03316naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100003000139245019700169300001800366500002000384520183500404592002802239650002102267650001402288650002402302650001802326650003902344650002602383650001002409650001002419650001602429650001902445650002502464650001402489650003002503650001802533650001402551700003102565700004002596700001802636700002002654773010202674856007302776852000902849655001202858IND60572217520221120214501.0170712e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057221752DNAL7 a10.1111/mec.139042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPalomares‐Rius, Juan E.10aMolecular diversity of bacterial endosymbionts associated with dagger nematodes of the genus Xiphinema (Nematoda: Longidoridae) reveals a high degree of phylogenetic congruence with their host  ap. 6225-6247.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBacterial endosymbionts have been detected in some groups of plant‐parasitic nematodes, but few cases have been reported compared to other groups in the phylum Nematoda, such as animal‐parasitic or free‐living nematodes. This study was performed on a wide variety of plant‐parasitic nematode families and species from different host plants and nematode populations. A total of 124 nematode populations (previously identified morphologically and molecularly) were screened for the presence of potential bacterial endosymbionts using the partial 16S rRNA gene and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and confocal microscopy. Potential bacterial endosymbionts were only detected in nematode species belonging to the genus Xiphinema and specifically in the X. americanum group. Fifty‐seven partial 16S rRNA sequences were obtained from bacterial endosymbionts in this study. One group of sequences was closely related to the genus ‘Candidatus Xiphinematobacter’ (19 bacterial endosymbiont sequences were associated with seven nematode host species, including two that have already been described and three unknown bacterial endosymbionts). The second bacterial endosymbiont group (38 bacterial endosymbiont sequences associated with six nematode species) was related to the family Burkholderiaceae, which includes fungal and soil–plant bacterial endosymbionts. These endosymbionts were reported for the first time in the phylum Nematoda. Our findings suggest that there is a highly specific symbiotic relationship between nematode host and bacterial endosymbionts. Overall, these results were corroborated by a phylogeny of nematode host and bacterial endosymbionts that suggested that there was a high degree of phylogenetic congruence and long‐term evolutionary persistence between hosts and endosymbionts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBurkholderiaceae 3aXiphinema 3aconfocal microscopy 3aendosymbionts 3afluorescence in situ hybridization 3afree-living nematodes 3afungi 3agenes 3ahost plants 3amicrosymbionts 3anucleotide sequences 3aphylogeny 3aplant parasitic nematodes 3aribosomal RNA 3asymbiosis1 aArchidona‐Yuste, Antonio1 aCantalapiedra‐Navarrete, Carolina1 aPrieto, Pilar1 aCastillo, Pablo0 tMolecular ecology.g2016 Dec., v. 25, no. 24 p.6225-6247dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0962-10837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mec.139043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02975naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245017900169300001600348520135600364592002801720650001501748650001401763650001201777650001101789650001301800650002101813650001701834650001501851650001901866650001301885650002101898650001701919650001101936650001701947650001401964650001101978653001901989653001902008653001902027653002302046653003202069700001802101700001802119700005602137700005402193700001702247773008702264856008502351852000902436655001202445IND60628089720221122050608.0210114e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062808972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2018.12.1132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Shanxing10aInsight to the synergistic effect of N-doping level and pore structure on improving the electrochemical performance of sulfur/N-doped porous carbon cathode for Li-S batteries  ap. 745-755.  aThree nitrogen-doped porous carbons (NDPCs) with the ultrahigh specific surface areas are prepared via a one-step activation of the biomass waste. The as-prepared samples have different levels of nitrogen contents and pore structure. These sulfur hosting matrix materials are designed to systematically elaborate the effect of N-doping level and pore structure on the electrochemical performance of the S/NDPC nanocomposites. The higher volume ratio of marco-mesopores to micropores of the substrate can greatly enhance the rate capability of the S/NDPC cathodes. This is attributed to the improved electrolyte penetration via the rich marco-mesopores. Meanwhile, the higher nitrogen content of the NDPC contributes to improving the cycle stability of the S/NDPC cathode, which is assigned to the strong chemical adsorption and physical restriction of polysulfides by the interaction of nitrogen atom and polysulfides. Therefore, the S/NDPC-1 cathode, prepared by using a NDPC matrix with high nitrogen content, large specific surface area, and a moderate microporous volume percentage (VMᵢcᵣₒ/VT), displays an obvious enhancement in the electrochemical performance. It exhibits specific capacities of 926.1 and 815.8 mAh g⁻¹ at 0.5 and 1.0 C rate, respectively, with a capacity fading rate of only 0.067% per cycle after 500 cycles at 1.0 C.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3abatteries 3abiomass 3acarbon 3acathodes 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrolytes 3amicropores 3ananocomposites 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3aporous media 3asulfur 3asurface area 3asynergism 3awastes 0aLi-S batteries 0aN-doped carbon 0aPore structure 0aSynergistic effect 0aElectrochemical performance1 aZou, Kaixiang1 aQian, Yunxian1 aDeng, Yuanfu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2460-72241 aZhang, Lei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6385-57731 aChen, Guohua0 tCarbon.g2019 Apr., v. 144 p.745-755dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2018.12.1133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02814naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001400152245006400166300001600230520157700246592002801823650001101851650002101862650000901883650002101892650001401913650001101927650001901938650002601957650001801983650001302001650001002014650001502024650001502039650001802054651001002072653001102082653002102093653001402114653002002128700001402148773009802162856008702260852000902347655001202356IND60581125320221120040846.0180830e20161015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058112532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.07.1142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJi, Shiyu10aCarbon footprint accounting of a typical wind farm in China  ap. 416-423.  aThe reserves and exploitable capacity of the wind power resource in China are both ranked first in the world and could be developed to strengthen China’s energy security and mitigate global warming. Carbon footprint accounting of wind farms is vital for large-scale wind energy exploitation. This paper establishes a systematic accounting framework with life cycle assessment (LCA) and input–output analysis (IOA) for the overall carbon footprint of the life cycle of a typical wind farm. Carbon emissions from the construction, operation, and dismantling phases are considered in the LCA of the wind farm. Then, each expense of the wind farm is treated as a change in exogenous demand for the output of the corresponding economic sectors according to the IOA. In addition, the virtual carbon footprint from peak regulation triggered by the on-grid fluctuation of wind power is incorporated. The results show the total carbon footprint of the studied wind farm is 1.45×10⁴tCO2 over the 21-year lifetime. The construction phase accounts for the largest fraction (76.74%), followed by the operation phase (15.32%) and dismantling phase (7.94%). According to the IOA, the indirect carbon footprint of the wind farm is greater than the direct footprint. The “Smelting and Pressing of Metals” sector that produces the steel and copper used to manufacture the wind turbines dominates the carbon footprint. The virtual carbon footprint of coal-fired power for wind power peak regulation is estimated to be 2.08×10³tCO2, which is close to that of the operation phase.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acarbon footprint 3acoal 3aeconomic sectors 3aemissions 3aenergy 3aglobal warming 3alife cycle assessment 3amanufacturing 3apressing 3asteel 3awind farms 3awind power 3awind turbines 3aChina 0aIO-LCA 0aCarbon footprint 0aWind farm 0aPeak regulation1 aChen, Bin0 tApplied energy.g2016 Oct. 15, v. 180 p.416-423dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.07.1143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01894naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002000112245013000132300001600262520096100278592002801239653002301267653001901290653002401309653003001333653003101363700002201394700002201416700002301438700002201461773010001483852000901583655001201592IND60125322820221116143214.0151124e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012532282DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHennon, Paul E.10aShifting Climate, Altered Niche, and a Dynamic Conservation Strategy for Yellow-Cedar in the North Pacific Coastal Rainforest  ap. 147-158.  aThe extensive mortality of yellow-cedar along more than 1000 kilometers of the northern Pacific coast of North America serves as a leading example of climate effects on a forest tree species. In this article, we document our approaches to resolving the causes of tree death, which we explain as a cascade of interacting topographic, forest-structure, and microclimate factors that act on a unique vulnerability of yellow-cedar to fine-root freezing. The complex causes of tree mortality are reduced to two risk factors—snow depth and soil drainage—which are then used to model present and future cedar habitat suitability. We propose a dynamic, comprehensive conservation strategy for this valuable species on the basis of zones created by shifting climate, cedar's ecological niche, and observed risk factors. Research on yellow-cedar decline is offered as a template for understanding and adapting to climate change for other climate—forest issues.  aPublisher supplied data 0aclimate adaptation 0aforest decline 0aroot cold tolerance 0aCallitropsis nootkatensis 0aChamaecyparis nootkatensis1 aD'Amore, David V.1 aSchaberg, Paul G.1 aWittwer, Dustin T.1 aShanley, Colin S.0 tBioScience.g2012 Feb., v. 62, no. 2 p.147-158dUniversity of California Pressx0006-35687nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02811naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100003200145245009700177300001600274520138100290592002801671650001501699650002301714650001501737650001701752650001401769650002201783650001601805650001401821650002401835650001501859650001301874650002601887650001501913650002301928650001101951650001501962650002601977650002202003650001602025650001102041700001702052700001902069700001802088700001602106700003402122773008202156856004602238852000902284655001202293IND50089404520221120052656.0140507e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008940452DNAL7 a10.1111/1574-6941.122932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLangarica‐Fuentes, Adrian10aFungal succession in an in‐vessel composting system characterized using 454 pyrosequencing  ap. 296-308.  aFungi are known to have an important role in the composting process as degraders of recalcitrant materials such as cellulose and lignin. Previous attempts to study the diversity and succession of fungi in compost systems have relied on the use of culture‐dependent analyses and low‐resolution DNA‐fingerprinting techniques, lacking the necessary depth to analyse such a rich ecosystem. In this study, 454 pyrosequencing was used to characterize the fungal community composition at the different stages of an in‐vessel composting process. A complex succession of fungi was revealed, with 251 fungal OTUs identified throughout the monitoring period. The Ascomycota were the dominant phylum (82.5% of all sequences recovered), followed by the Basidiomycota (10.4%) and the subphylum Mucoromycotina (4.9%). In the starting materials and early stages of the process, yeast species from the Saccharomycetales were abundant, while in latter stages and in the high temperature regions of the pile, fungi from the orders Eurotiales, Sordariales, Mucorales, Agaricales and Microascales were the most prominent. This study provides an improved understanding of the fungal diversity occurring during the composting of municipal solid waste, and this knowledge can lead to the development of more efficient composting practices and a better evaluation of the end‐product quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgaricales 3aDNA fingerprinting 3aEurotiales 3aMicroascales 3aMucorales 3aSaccharomycetales 3aSordariales 3acellulose 3acommunity structure 3acomposting 3acomposts 3aecological succession 3aecosystems 3afungal communities 3alignin 3amonitoring 3amunicipal solid waste 3asequence analysis 3atemperature 3ayeasts1 aZafar, Urooj1 aHeyworth, Alan1 aBrown, Thomas1 aFox, Graeme1 aRobson, G.

Multifarious environmental variables can influence gene flow in different ways and expert knowledge is frequently used to construct friction maps. However, the extent of the migration and the movement of single individuals are frequently unknown, especially for non-model species, and friction maps only based on expert knowledge can be misleading. In this study, we used three different methods: isolation by distance (IBD), least-cost modelling and a strip-based approach to disentangle the human implication in the fragmentation process in the slow worm (Anguis fragilis), as well as the specific landscape elements shaping the genetic structure in a highly anthropized 16 km2 area in Switzerland. Friction maps were constructed using expert opinion, but also based on the combination of all possible weightings for all landscape elements. The IBD indicated a significant effect of geographic distance on genetic differentiation. Further approaches demonstrated that highways and railways were the most important elements impeding the gene flow in this area. Surprisingly, we also found that agricultural areas and dense forests seemed to be used as dispersal corridors. These results confirmed that the slow worm has relatively unspecific habitat requirements. Finally, we showed that our models based on expert knowledge performed poorly compared to cautious analysis of each variable. This study demonstrated that landscape genetic analyses should take expert knowledge with caution and exhaustive analyses of each landscape element without a priori knowledge and different methods can be recommended. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenvironmental factors 3aexpert opinion 3aforests 3afriction 3agene flow 3agenetic distance 3agenetic variation 3ahabitats 3ahighways 3amodels 3apopulation structure 3arailroads 3aSwitzerland1 aRay, Nicolas1 aLehmann, Anthony1 aUrsenbacher, Sylvain0 tConservation genetics.g2013 Aug., v. 14, no. 4 p.783-794dSpringer-Verlagx1566-06217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10592-013-0474-y  aDNAL 7aarticle02720naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003700092040001800129100001700147245009700164300001800261500002400279520141600303650002101719650001101740650002001751650002001771650001901791650002201810650001001832650002701842651001001869653002301879653001401902700001601916700001601932773011901948852000902067856007602076856008702152930003302239945001302272946001302285655001202298IND2331536220221120204014.0030321e200112  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233153622DNAL7 a10.1603/0046-225X-30.6.11502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYamanaka, T.10aFlight characteristics and dispersal patterns of fall webworm (Lepidoptera: Arctiidae) males  ap. 1150-1157.  aIncludes references  aFlight characteristics and dispersal patterns of male fall webworms, Hyphantria cunea (Drury), were investigated in three experiments: a flight-mill experiment to estimate potential flight metrics, a wind-tunnel experiment for daily patterns of male activity, and field trials of mark-recapture for estimating dispersal patterns of males in the field. In the flight-mill experiment, males had the potential to fly over 7 km after 12 h on average and, at maximum, longer than 23 km. However, the wind-tunnel experiment revealed that a sharp peak of male response was limited to 1 h around the light-on time both in response to a synthetic sex pheromone lure and to virgin females. Thus, the actual flight period of males is limited in the field. In the mark-recapture experiment, the mean distance between recapture points and the release point on the first day was <200 m in both summer and autumn. The largest number of males was captured in the first concentric on the first and the second day despite a few males that were captured outside the first concentric. Male density seemed to be diluted uniformly and distributed outside the first concentric after the fourth day. Thus, H. cunea males did not disperse over long distances, rather the dispersal range is likely to be limited to only several hundred meters (<300 m) a day because of a limited period (30 min-1 h/day) of male mating activity in nature. 3aHyphantria cunea 3aflight 3amating behavior 3asex attractants 3asex pheromones 3adiurnal variation 3amales 3amark-recapture studies 3aJapan 0adistance travelled 0adispersal1 aTatsuki, S.1 aShimada, M.0 tEnvironmental entomology.g2001 Dec., v. 30, no. 6 p.1150-1157dEntomological Society of America.x0046-225X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.entsoc.org/pubs/periodicals/ee/index.htm3Tables on contents40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603/0046-225X-30.6.11503Available from publisher's Web site  a20050410b20050501c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US 7aarticle02173naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005700148245006300205300001800268520106800286592002801354650001201382650000801394650000801402650001301410650001601423650002101439650001301460650001401473650001301487700005801500700005801558773011501616856008301731852000901814655001201823IND60777781220221119190907.0220521e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077778122DNAL7 a10.1007/s00705-022-05454-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSimón, Diego1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6317-399113aAn overview of dinucleotide and codon usage in all viruses  ap. 1443-1448.  aViruses are, by far, the most abundant biological entities on earth. They are found in all known ecological niches and are the causative agents of many important diseases in plants and animals. From an evolutionary point of view, since viruses do not share any orthologous genes, there is a general consensus that they are polyphyletic; that is, they do not have a common ancestor. This means that they appeared several times during the course of evolution. For their life cycle, they are always obligate parasites of a free cellular life form, which can be bacteria, archaea, or eukaryotes. More complexity is added to these entities by the fact that their genetic material can be DNA or RNA (double- or single-stranded) or retrotranscribed. Given these features, we wondered if some general rules can be inferred when studying two basic genomic signatures—dinucleotides and codon usage—analyzing all available complete and non-redundant viral sequences. In spite of the obviously biased sample of sequences available, some general features appear to emerge.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArchaea 3aDNA 3aRNA 3aancestry 3acodon usage 3aeukaryotic cells 3agenomics 3apolyphyly 3avirology1 aCristina, Juan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4508-84351 aMusto, Héctor1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9863-08410 tArchives of virology.g2022 June, v. 167, no. 6 p.1443-1448dSpringer ViennawJournal:jnl6093x0304-86087nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00705-022-05454-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02467naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002300145245009500168300001600263520131700279592002801596653002501624653003301649653002301682653002201705653004201727700001401769700002101783700002201804700002901826700001901855700002101874700001801895773010001913856008302013852000902096655001202105IND60125323020221116143207.0151124e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012532302DNAL7 a10.1525/bio.2012.62.3.52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMitsch, William J.10aCreating Wetlands: Primary Succession, Water Quality Changes and Self-Design over 15 Years  ap. 237-250.  aThe succession of vegetation, soil development, water quality changes, and carbon and nitrogen dynamics are summarized in this article for a pair of 1-hectare flow-through-created riverine wetlands for their first 15 years. Wetland plant richness increased from 13 originally planted species to 116 species overall after 15 years, with most of the increase occurring in the first 5 years. The planted wetland had a higher plant community diversity index for 15 years, whereas the unplanted wetland was more productive. Wetland soils turned hydric within a few years; soil organic carbon doubled in 10 years and almost tripled in 15 years. Nutrient removal was similar in the two wetlands in most years, with a trend of decreased removal over 15 years for phosphorus. Denitrification accounted for a small percentage of the nitrogen reduction in the wetlands. The wetlands were effective carbon sinks with retention rates of 1800–2700 kilograms of carbon per hectare per year, higher than in comparable reference wetlands and more commonly studied boreal peatlands. Methane emission rates are low enough to create little concern that the wetlands are net sources of climate change radiative forcing. Planting appears to have influenced carbon accumulation, methane emissions, and macrophyte community diversity.  aPublisher supplied data 0aecosystem experiment 0along-term ecosystem research 0afreshwater marshes 0ariparian wetlands 0aOlentangy River Wetland Research Park1 aZhang, Li1 aStefanik, Kay C.1 aNahlik, Amanda M.1 aAnderson, Christopher J.1 aBernal, Blanca1 aHernandez, Maria1 aSong, Keunyea0 tBioScience.g2012 Mar., v. 62, no. 3 p.237-250dUniversity of California Pressx0006-35687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1525/bio.2012.62.3.53Available from publisher's Web site  aDNAL 7aarticle03917naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100003000140245012900170520225500299592002802554650001502582650001002597650000902607650001202616650001102628650001802639650002002657650002202677650001502699650001202714650001602726650001702742650001302759650001102772650003302783650001802816650001502834650001202849650001302861650001502874650001202889650001602901651001002917700002902927700003302956700002502989700003603014700003303050700003103083700002403114773012903138856007503267852000903342655001203351IND60784190120221123005444.0220726e20220714xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078419012DNAL7 a10.3390/rs141433892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGómez Flores, José Luis10aDepth-Specific Soil Electrical Conductivity and NDVI Elucidate Salinity Effects on Crop Development in Reclaimed Marsh Soils  aAgricultural management decision-making in salinization-prone environments requires efficient soil salinity monitoring methods. This is the case in the B-XII irrigation district in SW Spain, a heavy clay reclaimed marsh area where a shallow saline water table and intensively irrigated agriculture create a fragile balance between salt accumulation and leaching in the root zone, which might be disrupted by the introduction of new crops and increasing climate variability. We evaluated the potential of electromagnetic induction (EMI) tomography for field-scale soil salinity assessment in this hyper-conductive environment, using EMI and limited analytical soil data measured in 2017 and 2020 under a processing tomato–cotton–sugar beet crop rotation. Salinity effects on crop development were assessed by comparing Sentinel 2 NDVI imagery with inverted depth-specific electrical conductivity (EC). Average apparent electrical conductivity (ECa) for the 1-m depth signal was 20% smaller in 2020 than in 2017, although the spatial ECa pattern was similar for both years. Inverted depth-specific EC showed a strong correlation (R ≈ 0.90) with saturated paste extract EC (ECe), [Na⁺] and sodium absorption ratio (SAR), resulting in linear calibration equations with R² ≈ 0.8 for both years and leave-one-out cross validation Nash–Sutcliffe Efficiency Coefficient, ranging from 0.57 to 0.74. Overall, the chemical parameter estimation improved with depth and soil wetness (2017), yielding 0.83 < R <0.98 at 0.9 m. The observed spatial EC distributions showed a steadily increasing inverse correlation with NDVI during the growing season, particularly for processing tomato and cotton, reaching R values of −0.71 and −0.85, respectively. These results confirm the potential of EMI tomography for mapping and monitoring soil salinity in the B-XII irrigation district, while it allows, in combination with NDVI imagery, a detailed spatial assessment of soil salinity impacts on crop development throughout the growing season. Contrary to the popular belief among farmers in the area, and despite non-saline topsoil conditions, spatial EC and subsoil salinity patterns were found to affect crop development negatively in the studied field.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3abeets 3aclay 3aclimate 3acotton 3acrop rotation 3adecision making 3airrigated farming 3airrigation 3amarshes 3arhizosphere 3asaline water 3asalinity 3asodium 3asoil electrical conductivity 3asoil salinity 3asoil water 3asubsoil 3atomatoes 3atomography 3atopsoil 3awater table 3aSpain1 aRamos Rodríguez, Mario 1 aGonzález Jiménez, Alfonso 1 aFarzamian, Mohammad 1 aHerencia Galán, Juan Francisco1 aSalvatierra Bellido, Benito 1 aCermeño Sacristan, Pedro 1 aVanderlinden, Karl 0 tRemote Sensing.g2022 July 14, v. 14, no. 14dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs141433893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01995naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002800112245011600140300001600256520112600272592002801398653001101426653001901437653002201456700002301478700002501501700002201526700002201548700002601570773010001596852000901696655001201705IND60125323120221116143301.0151124e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012532312DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoore, S.

Marine mammals rely on sound as a primary sensory modality, and the noise associated with increasing human activities offshore can interfere with vital life functions. Many coastal communities rely on marine mammals for food and cultural identity, and subsistence hunters have expressed strong concerns that underwater sound from human activities negatively affects both the animals and hunting success. Federal regulations require scientists and oil and gas operators to acquire incidental harassment authorizations for activities that may disturb marine mammals. Currently, authorization requests are focused on the impacts of sound from activities considered in isolation of one another, and this precludes any possibility of a meaningful analysis of the cumulative impacts from multiple sources. We propose a new assessment framework that is based on the acoustic habitats that constitute the aggregate sound field from multiple sources, compiled at spatial and temporal scales consistent with the ecology of Arctic marine mammals.  aPublisher supplied data 0aArctic 0amarine mammals 0aacoustic habitats1 aReeves, Randall R.1 aSouthall, Brandon L.1 aRagen, Timothy J.1 aSuydam, Robert S.1 aClark, Christopher W.0 tBioScience.g2012 Mar., v. 62, no. 3 p.289-295dUniversity of California Pressx0006-35687nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle01480naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245009000159300001800249500001900267520051000286592002800796650000800824650001700832650001100849650001500860650001400875700001800889700001500907700001600922773013300938856007401071852000901145655001201154IND60729785220221117235245.0210302e20210301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072978522DNAL7 a10.1039/d0cc07893j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Ruiyuan12aA multicolor DNA tetrahedron nanoprobe for analyzing human telomerase in living cells  ap. 2188-2191.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aHerein, we report the in situ analysis of human telomerase by a multicolor DNA tetrahedron nanoprobe.

However, the recycling supply may depend on different variables such as area, inhabitants, municipal budget, financial regime, among others. All these factors translate into gaps regarding recycling achievements. In this paper, we study the problem of adoption recycling by municipalities from developing countries. In particular, we study the Santiago Metropolitan Area (Chile). Our research is based on qualitative interviews, quantitative data collection and mathematical modelling. We formulate an optimization model to analyse two policy options in municipal solid waste management (MSWM): increase or redistribution of existing resources. The obtained results show, first, that the concerns among key actors about MSWM can be translated into variables that are statistically significant in the quantitative models to predict probability of adopting recycling. Second, the analysed policy options have different impacts. The increase of the average probability for adoption by redistributing one percentage point of MSWM expenses, is similar to one-half percentage point increased in all municipalities. Third, neither redistribution nor overall resource increases would ensure adoption of recycling in the entire metropolitan area. Finally, we discuss the obtained results in light of qualitative interviews. The specific policy alternatives to implement resource increases are a landfill tax and rising council taxes: both seem politically unfeasible to actors from the MSWM sector. Using an innovative mixed-methods approach, we are able to illustrate both the importance of resource redistribution in the supply-side, and the institutional and political complexity of policy implementation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarea 3aconsumer demand 3adata collection 3adeveloping countries 3aincome 3ainterviews 3aissues and policy 3alandfills 3alight 3amathematical models 3ametropolitan areas 3amunicipal solid waste 3apaper 3apolitics 3aprobability 3arecycling 3aresearch 3asupply 3ataxes 3aChile 0aMunicipal solid waste management 0aRecycling program 0aDeveloping countries 0aMathematical models 0aInequality 0aRedistribution1 aAraya-Córdova, Patricio J.1 aDávila, Sebastián,1 aVásquez, Óscar C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1393-46920 tResources, conservation, and recycling.g2021 Jan., v. 164 p.105173-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11928x0921-34497nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2020.1051733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03632naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100002200169245010300191300001400294520157600308592002801884650001801912650001301930650002401943650001701967650001101984650002501995650001802020650001102038650002202049650001702071650001402088650002502102650002802127650005302155650002102208650001802229650004402247650004302291650001102334650003402345650002302379650004402402650002602446650004802472650002102520650005202541650002402593650002202617700002202639700001902661700002302680700002302703700002002726700002402746773009602770856008402866990002302950852000902973655001202982IND60092064620221120083210.0141103e20110428xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009206462DNAL7 a213390452pmid7 a10.1016/j.canlet.2011.01.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYamada, Shin-ichi10aOverexpression of CRKII increases migration and invasive potential in oral squamous cell carcinoma  ap. 84-91.  aCT10 regulator of kinase (CRK) was originally identified as an oncogene product of v-CRK in a CT10 chicken retrovirus system. Overexpression of CRKII has been reported in several human cancers. CRKII regulates cell migration, morphogenesis, invasion, phagocytosis, and survival; however, the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. In the present study, we evaluated the possibility of CRKII as an appropriate molecular target for cancer gene therapy. The expression of CRKII in 71 primary oral squamous cell carcinomas and 10 normal oral mucosal specimens was determined immunohistochemically, and the correlation of CRKII overexpression with clinicopathological factors was evaluated. Overexpression of CRKII was detected in 41 of 70 oral squamous cell carcinomas, the frequency being more significant than in normal oral mucosa. In addition, CRKII overexpression was more frequent in higher-grade cancers according to the T classification, N classification, and invasive pattern. Moreover, RNAi-mediated suppression of CRKII expression reduced the migration and invasion potential of an oral squamous cell carcinoma cell line, OSC20. Downregulation of CRKII expression also reduced the expression of Dock180, p130Cas, and Rac1, and the actin-associated scaffolding protein cortactin. These results indicate that the overexpression of CRKII is tightly associated with an aggressive phenotype of oral squamous cell carcinoma. Therefore, we propose that CRKII could be a potential molecular target of gene therapy by RNAi-targeting in oral squamous cell carcinoma.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell movement 3achickens 3agene overexpression 3agene therapy 3ahumans 3aimmunohistochemistry 3amorphogenesis 3amucosa 3aoncogene proteins 3aphagocytosis 3aphenotype 3ascaffolding proteins 3asquamous cell carcinoma 2aCarcinoma, Squamous Cellxmetabolismxpathology. 2aCell Line, Tumor 2aCell Movement 2aGene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic 2aGene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic 2aHumans 2aImmunohistochemistryxmethods 2aModels, Biological 2aMouth Neoplasmsxmetabolismxpathology. 2aNeoplasm Invasiveness 2aProto-Oncogene Proteins c-crkxbiosynthesis 2aRNA Interference 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aSignal Transduction 2aTreatment Outcome1 aYanamoto, Souichi1 aKawasaki, Goro1 aRokutanda, Satoshi1 aYonezawa, Hisanobu1 aKawakita, Akiko1 aNemoto, Takayuki K.0 tCancer letters.g2011 Apr. 28, v. 303, no. 2 p.84-91dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0304-38357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.canlet.2011.01.0043Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02334naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245013700174300001600311520109700327592002801424650001501452650001201467650002101479650001301500650001501513650000901528650001301537650001401550650001001564650001301574650001501587650002201602650001501624651001601639653001201655653003101667653001101698773010801709856008601817852000901903655001201912IND60691472220221121224751.0200430e20021001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069147222DNAL7 a10.1080/15627020.2002.116571722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorioka, Shinsuke10aOtolith features and growth of juvenile Opsaridium microcephalum (Pisces: Cyprinidae) from the southwestern shoreline of Lake Malawi  ap. 165-170.  aSanjika, Opsaridium microcephalum, were collected from two sites (Nkhotakota and Chia) along the southwestern shoreline of Lake Malawi. The sagitta of the otolith was arrowhead-shaped with an obvious nucleus. Increments in the sagittae were observable until the bases of the rostra but invisible in the rostra. The asteriscus was oval-shaped with an ambiguous nucleus, leading to difficulty in identifying the first increment. The lapillus was ‘a’-shaped with an obvious nucleus and increments were observable from the nucleus to the margin. The lapillus was therefore considered the most suitable structure for interpreting daily growth increments in this species. The estimated hatching months of fish based on lapilli increment counts were from November to July, suggesting that this species has a long breeding period of at least eight months per year. The growth rate of fish born in the rainy season (0.74 mm TL per day) was higher than those in the dry season (0.56 mm TL per day). This growth difference was considered to be due to the difference in water temperature in the lake.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCyprinidae 3aSagitta 3aSalvia hispanica 3abreeding 3adry season 3afish 3ahatching 3ajuveniles 3alakes 3aotoliths 3ashorelines 3awater temperature 3awet season 3aLake Malawi 0aSanjika 0aOtolith increment analysis 0aGrowth0 tAfrican zoology.g2002 Oct. 1, v. 37, no. 2 p.165-170dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12091x2224-073X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15627020.2002.116571723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02140naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002300112245012400135300001600259520108400275592002801359653003201387653002701419653003801446653001601484653002701500700003401527700002001561700001901581700002501600700002201625700002501647700002101672773010001693852000901793655001201802IND60125323220221116143233.0151124e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012532322DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchmidt, Amanda H.12aA New Model for Training Graduate Students to Conduct Interdisciplinary, Interorganizational and International Research  ap. 296-304.  aEnvironmental challenges are often global in scope and require solutions that integrate knowledge across disciplines, cultures, and organizations.

We then present a National Science Foundation Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship Program at the University of Washington as a model of border-crossing graduate training focused on interdisciplinary, international, and interorganizational (I³) collaborations on environmental challenges. Finally, we offer recommendations from this program to those considering similar I³ training programs, including strategies for maintaining faculty buy-in, for scaffolding student training to cross borders, and for conducting focused group trips that give the students structured experience crossing all three borders simultaneously.  aPublisher supplied data 0ainterdisciplinary education 0ainternational research 0ainterorganizational collaboration 0ascaffolding 0aproblem-based training1 aRobbins, Alicia Susan Tanner,1 aCombs, Julie K.1 aFreeburg, Adam1 aJesperson, Robert G.1 aRogers, Haldre S.1 aSheldon, Kimberly S.1 aWheat, Elizabeth0 tBioScience.g2012 Mar., v. 62, no. 3 p.296-304dUniversity of California Pressx0006-35687nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02683naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001500145245011100160300001400271500001100285520134700296592002801643650002401671650001301695650000901708650002401717650002601741650001801767650001001785650001601795650000901811650001201820650001401832650005201846650001101898650001601909650001401925700002101939700001601960773018501976856007902161852000902240655001202249IND50089404820221120065011.0150218e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008940482DNAL7 a10.1111/1574-6968.124302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Zhen10aCold shock protein A plays an important role in the stress adaptation and virulence of Brucella melitensis  ap. 27-36.  aLETTER  aBrucella melitensis is a facultative intracellular pathogen that mainly resides within macrophages. The mechanisms employed by Brucella to adapt to harsh intracellular environments and survive within host macrophages are not clearly understood. Here, we constructed a cspA gene deletion mutant, NIΔcspA, that did not exhibit any discernible growth defect at a normal culture temperature (37 °C) or at a low temperature (15 °C). However, expression of the cspA gene in Brucella was induced by cold, acidic, and oxidative conditions, as determined via quantitative reverse transcription PCR. Unlike its parental strain, B. melitensis NI, the NIΔcspA mutant showed an increased sensitivity to acidic and H₂O₂stresses, especially during the mid‐log‐phase, and these stress conditions would presumably be encountered by bacteria during intracellular infections. Moreover, macrophage and mouse infection assays indicated that the NIΔcspA mutant fails to replicate in cultured J774.A1 murine macrophages and is rapidly cleared from the spleens of experimentally infected BALB/c mice. These findings suggest that the Brucella cspA gene makes an essential contribution to virulence in vitro and in vivo, most likely by allowing brucellae to adapt appropriately to the harsh environmental conditions encountered within host macrophages.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrucella melitensis 3abacteria 3acold 3acold shock proteins 3aenvironmental factors 3agene deletion 3agenes 3amacrophages 3amice 3amutants 3apathogens 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3aspleen 3atemperature 3avirulence1 aWang, Shuangshan1 aWu, Qingmin0 tFEMS microbiology letters.g2014 May, v. 354, no. 1 p.27-36dPublished by Elsevier/North Holland on behalf of the Federation of European Microbiological Societies.x0378-10977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1574-6968.124303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02042naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002500152245010900177300001600286520097600302592002801278650001701306650001601323650001801339650001301357650000901370650002301379650002201402651001701424653001101441653001701452700002001469773010801489856008601597852000901683655001201692IND60691472320221121224807.0200430e20021001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069147232DNAL7 a10.1080/15627020.2002.116571732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLechanteur, Y.A.R.G.10aComposition and seasonal variability of the suprabenthic reef-fish assemblage in False Bay, South Africa  ap. 171-184.  aThe composition and seasonal variability of a False Bay suprabenthic reef-fish assemblage was investigated monthly at a protected reef site (to a depth of 25 m) for 14 months. In total, 25 484 fish from 28 species (26 demersal) were counted. Sparids dominated the assemblage (50 % of species and 87.3 % of individuals), followed by cheilodactylids (15.4 % of species and 7.5 % of individuals). Pachymetopon blochii (30.6 %), Sarpa salpa (17.7 %), Boopsoidea inornata (16.1 %), Chrysoblephus laticeps (10.4 %) and Spondyliosoma emarginatum (9.2 %) were the five most abundant species, while the ten most abundant species made up over 93 % of censused individuals. Composition was relatively stable year round, irrespective of water temperature variations, with 16 of the 26 reef-fish species censused encountered during more than 10 monthly censuses. Triakus megalopterus and large Chrysoblephus gibbiceps were the only species whose abundance appeared to vary seasonally.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPachymetopon 3aSarpa salpa 3aSpondyliosoma 3acensuses 3afish 3aseasonal variation 3awater temperature 3aSouth Africa 0aCensus 0aFish Density1 aGriffiths, C.L.0 tAfrican zoology.g2002 Oct. 1, v. 37, no. 2 p.171-184dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12091x2224-073X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15627020.2002.116571733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02835naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245016400169300001600333520110700349592002801456650002001484650001601504650001801520650000901538650001501547650001601562650002001578650003201598650002001630650001001650650001901660650001301679650001801692650001101710653003601721653002701757653002601784653002001810653002601830700001901856700001301875700001301888700001801901700001701919700001401936700001501950700001801965700001901983700001202002700001202014700001702026773010602043856008702149852000902236655001202245IND60571110620221120234729.0190409e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057111062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2017.05.2052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yimin10aNitrate removal, spatiotemporal communities of denitrifiers and the importance of their genetic potential for denitrification in novel denitrifying bioreactors  ap. 552-562.  aNitrate treatment performance and denitrification activity were compared between denitrifying biological filters (DNBFs) based on dewatered alum sludge (DAS) and neutralized used acid (NUA). The spatiotemporal distribution of denitrifying genes and the genetic potential associated with denitrification activity and nitrate removal in both DNBFs were also evaluated. The removal efficiency of NUA–DNBF increased by 8% compared with that of DAS–DNBF, and the former NUA–DNBF emitted higher amount of N2O. Analysis of abundance and composition profiles showed that denitrifying gene patterns varied more or less in two matrices with different depths at three sampling times. Burkholderiales, Rhodocyclales, and Rhizobiales were the most commonly detected in both media during stable periods. Denitrification was determined by the abundance of specific genes or their ratios as revealed by controlling factors. The enhanced nitrate removal could be due to increasing qnosZ or decreasing ∑qnir/qnosZ. Furthermore, NUA–DNBF solely reduced nitrate by increasing the denitrification enzyme activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBurkholderiales 3aRhizobiales 3aRhodocyclales 3aalum 3abiofilters 3abioreactors 3adenitrification 3adenitrifying microorganisms 3aenzyme activity 3agenes 3agenetic traits 3anitrates 3anitrous oxide 3asludge 0aDenitrification enzyme activity 0aDenitrifying biofilter 0aDewatered alum sludge 0aFunctional gene 0aNeutralized used acid1 aWang, Longmian1 aHan, Wei1 aWang, Xu1 aGuo, Zhaobing1 aPeng, Fuquan1 aYang, Fei1 aKong, Ming1 aGao, Yuexiang1 aChao, Jianying1 aWu, Dan1 aXu, Bin1 aZhu, Yueming0 tBioresource technology.g2017 Oct., v. 241 p.552-562dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2017.05.2053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02956naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245011800167300001600285500001900301520136100320592002801681650002701709650002301736650002801759650002101787650002101808650001301829650002001842650001601862650001301878650001401891650001801905650001501923650001101938650001501949650001901964650001501983650001301998653003602011653001802047653001902065700001902084700001502103700001702118700001602135700001502151700001702166773013502183856008702318852000902405655001202414IND60724169020221120131413.0210219e20210301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072416902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2021.01.0562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSu, Linyue10aChitosan-riboflavin composite film based on photodynamic inactivation technology for antibacterial food packaging  ap. 231-240.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPhotodynamic inactivation (PDI) is a novel sterilization technology that has proven effective in medicine. This study focused on applying PDI to food packaging, where chitosan (CS) films containing photosensitizing riboflavin (RB) were prepared via solution casting. The CS-RB composite films exhibited good ultraviolet (UV)-barrier properties, and had a visually appealing highly transparent yellow appearance. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) confirmed even dispersion of RB throughout the CS film. The addition of RB led to improved film characteristics, including the thickness, mechanical properties, solubility, and water barrier properties. The CS-RB⁵ composite films produced sufficient singlet oxygen under blue LED irradiation for 2 h to inactivate two food-borne pathogens (Listeria monocytogenes and Vibrio parahaemolyticus) and one spoilage bacteria (Shewanella baltica). The CS-RB composite films were assessed as a salmon packaging material, where inhibition of bacterial growth was observed. The film is biodegradable, and has the potential to alleviate the issues associated with the excessive use of petrochemical materials, such as environmental pollution and limited resources. The CS-RB composite films showed potential as a novel environmentally friendly packaging material for shelf-life extension of refrigerated food products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aListeria monocytogenes 3aShewanella baltica 3aVibrio parahaemolyticus 3abacterial growth 3abiodegradability 3achitosan 3acomposite films 3airradiation 3amedicine 3apollution 3arefrigeration 3ariboflavin 3asalmon 3ashelf life 3asinglet oxygen 3asolubility 3aspoilage 0aPhotodynamic inactivation (PDI) 0aAntibacterial 0aFood packaging1 aHuang, Jiaming1 aLi, Huihui1 aPan, Yingjie1 aZhu, Beiwei1 aZhao, Yong1 aLiu, Haiquan0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2021 Mar. 01, v. 172 p.231-240dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2021.01.0563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01395naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245010500154300001400259520032400273592002800597650001500625650002400640650001700664650001700681650002400698650001600722650002100738700001600759700001400775700001800789700001800807773013700825856007400962852000901036655001201045IND60670693220221120211838.0191002e20131127xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067069322DNAL7 a10.1039/c3tb21370f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Wei10aWater-soluble and phosphorus-containing carbon dots with strong green fluorescence for cell labeling  ap. 46-48.  aWater-soluble phosphorus-containing carbon dots (PCDs) with strong green fluorescence were synthesized through a facile one-step microwave assisted approach using phosphorus-rich phytic acid as a carbon source.

Willingness to pay (WTP) for charging an electric vehicle using renewable energy was collected through a U.S.-wide online survey of Plugin Electric Vehicle owners and lessees using the choice experiment method. The results indicate a 433% increase in the usage of charging stations if renewable energy was offered. Results also show a mean WTP to upgrade to renewable energy of $0.61 per hour for Level 2 EVSE and $1.82 for Direct Current Fast Chargers (DCFC). Using Blink public EVSE network as a case study, these usage and WTP values translate directly to an annual gross income increase of 655% from $1.45 million to $9.5 million, with an annual renewable energy credit acquisition cost of $13,700.

After the first outbreak in 2009 in northern Vietnam and southern China, the virus ravaged crops again on enormous scales in 2010, but infections have decreased sharply since 2011. We presumed that the sudden epidemics and fadeout of SRBSDV would be closely related to the migratory events of the insect vector, Sogatella furcifera. This study sought the source area of SRBSDV using the trajectory analysis method, and revealed the relationship between SRBSDV dynamics and migration of S. furcifera populations via an in-depth analysis of meteorological background of S. furcifera migration fields. The results showed that Northern Vietnam was the direct virus source area of the SRBSDV infection in China, and South Central Coast of Vietnam was the original source area of SRBSDV. Southwesterly winds were prevalent in spring of 2010 and carried large numbers of viruliferous S. furcifera to China from northern Vietnam. This infestation of S. furcifera was the direct cause of the SRBSDV outbreak in China in 2010. In 2011, the winter–spring temperatures were abnormally low and southeasterly and easterly winds dominated; therefore, the number of viruliferous S. furcifera that entered China was small, and consequently, the occurrence area of SRBSDV was rapidly reduced. The return of viruliferous S. furcifera to South Central Coast of Vietnam was an important factor that affected the occurrence scale of SRBSDV in the following year.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSogatella furcifera 3aSouthern rice black-streaked dwarf virus 3acoasts 3acrops 3adisease outbreaks 3ainsect vectors 3amigratory behavior 3arice 3aspring 3atemperature 3aviruses 3awind direction 3aChina 3aVietnam 0avirus–insect interaction 0atrajectory analysis 0apopulation reconstruction 0along-range migration1 aZhang, Guo1 aChen, Xiao1 aLi, Xi-Jie1 aXiong, Kai1 aCao, Shu-Pei1 aHu, Yan-Yue1 aLu, Ming-Hong1 aLiu, Wan-Cai1 aHoàng, Anh Tuấn,1 aQi, Guo-Jun1 aZhai, Bao-Ping0 tJournal of economic entomology.g2017 Mar. 2, v. 110, no. 3 p.854-864dEntomological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl46276x0022-04937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jee/tox0623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02334naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245010900169300001600278520092300294592002801217650001201245650001601257650001601273650001601289650000901305650001901314650001901333650002201352650002901374650000701403650002101410650001401431700002101445700006101466700006301527700002101590700002301611700006101634773011001695856008601805852000901891655001201900IND60612098020221118132419.0190705e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061209802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.idairyj.2018.05.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHo, Quang Tri10aEffect of pH and heat treatment on viscosity and heat coagulation properties of milk protein concentrate  ap. 219-224.  aThe effect of pH, adjusted using either hydrochloric acid (HCl), citric acid or sodium hydroxide, on calcium ion (Ca2+) activity, and consequent changes in viscosity and heat coagulation time (HCT) of milk protein concentrate (MPC) was investigated. Reducing the pH of MPC dispersions resulted in a reduction in their viscosity, which subsequently increased during heat treatment. The maximum heat stability of MPC was observed at pH 6.7. Reducing the pH of MPC from 6.7 to 6.2 resulted in a significant (P < 0.05) increase in Ca2+ activity, and reduction in HCT. Such changes were more extensive using HCl compared with citric acid. Increasing the pH greater than 6.7 also led to a reduction in HCT but a decrease in Ca2+ activity. These results demonstrate the importance of pH adjustment, and choice of acidulant, on Ca2+ activity, viscosity, and heat coagulation properties of MPC concentrates during processing.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcium 3acitric acid 3acoagulation 3adispersions 3aheat 3aheat stability 3aheat treatment 3ahydrochloric acid 3amilk protein concentrate 3apH 3asodium hydroxide 3aviscosity1 aMurphy, Kevin M.1 aDrapala, Kamil P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4897-47741 aO'Callaghan, Tom F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2684-72531 aFenelon, Mark A.1 aO'Mahony, James A.1 aMcCarthy, Noel A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2874-60180 tInternational dairy journal.g2018 Oct., v. 85 p.219-224dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48777x0958-69467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.idairyj.2018.05.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01659naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245016800155300002000323520057400343592002800917650001300945650001700958650001400975650001100989700002001000700001701020700001401037700002301051700002401074700001601098773012401114856007401238852000901312655001201321IND60664586920221123011532.0190912e20131021xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066458692DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ra42818d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Yimin10aPreparation of monolignol γ-acetate, γ-p-hydroxycinnamate, and γ-p-hydroxybenzoate conjugates: selective deacylation of phenolic acetates with hydrazine acetate  ap. 21964-21971.  aWe report here a reliable and facile synthesis of a range of monolignol γ-p-hydroxycinnamate (including p-coumarate, ferulate, and caffeate), γ-acetate, and γ-p-hydroxybenzoate conjugates, many not previously reported, that are either putative intermediates in the biosynthesis of natural lignins or new monomer-conjugates destined for upcoming designer lignins.

Their formation mechanism is not fully understood and the possible microbial involvement is under debate. In this study, we applied DNA metagenomic Shotgun sequencing of varnish and surrounding soil to evaluate the composition of the microbial community and its potential metabolic function. We found that the α diversity was lower in varnish compared to soil samples (p value < 0.05), suggesting distinct populations with significantly higher abundance of Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria and Cyanobacteria within the varnish. Additionally, we observed increased levels of transition metal metabolic processes in varnish compared to soil samples. Nevertheless, potentially relevant enzymes for varnish formation were detected at low to insignificant levels in both niches, indicating no current direct microbial involvement in Mn oxidation. This finding is supported by quantitative genomic analysis, elemental analysis, fluorescence imaging and scanning transmission X‐ray microscopy. We thus conclude that the distinct microbial communities detected in desert varnish originate from settled Aeolian microbes, which colonized this nutrient‐enriched niche, and discuss possible indirect contributions of microorganisms to the formation of desert varnish.  aPublisher supplied data 3aActinobacteria 3aCyanobacteria 3aDNA 3aProteobacteria 3aX-radiation 3abiochemical pathways 3acoatings 3adry environmental conditions 3aenzymes 3afluorescence 3aimage analysis 3amanganese 3ametagenomics 3amicrobial communities 3amicroorganisms 3amicroscopy 3aniches 3aoxidation 3arocks 3asequence analysis 3asoil 3asoil sampling 3aspecies diversity1 aMaier, Stefanie1 aMacholdt, Dorothea S.1 aMüller‐Germann, Isabell1 aYordanova, Petya1 aRodriguez‐Caballero, Emilio1 aJochum, Klaus P.1 aAl‐Amri, Abdullah1 aAndreae, Meinrat O.1 aFröhlich‐Nowoisky, Janine1 aWeber, Bettina0 tEnvironmental microbiology reports.g2018 June, v. 10, no. 3 p.264-271dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:2217x1758-22297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1758-2229.126343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03209naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245009700167300001600264520167900280592002801959650002301987650001502010650001702025650001702042650001002059650001302069650002102082650001202103650001202115650001102127650001302138650003502151650001102186650001602197650001902213650001602232653002802248653000802276653004402284653001902328653003302347653002302380653002302403700002002426700002102446700001802467773009802485856008702583852000902670655001202679IND60581125920221120040912.0180830e20161015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058112592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.07.1232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBerg, R.W.10aWater vapor pressure over molten KH2PO4 and demonstration of water electrolysis at ∼300°C  ap. 269-275.  aA new potentially high-efficiency electrolyte for water electrolysis: molten monobasic potassium phosphate, KH2PO4 or KDP has been investigated at temperatures ∼275–325°C. At these temperatures, KH2PO4 was found to dissociate into H2O gas in equilibrium with a melt mixture of KH2PO4K2H2P2O7KPO3H2O. The water vapor pressure above the melt, when contained in a closed ampoule, was determined quantitatively vs. temperature by use of Raman spectroscopy with methane or hydrogen gas as an internal calibration standard, using newly established relative ratios of Raman scattering cross sections of water and methane or hydrogen to be 0.40±0.02 or 1.2±0.03. At equilibrium the vapor pressure was much lower than the vapor pressure above liquid water at the same temperature. Electrolysis was realized by passing current through closed ampoules (vacuum sealed quartz glass electrolysis cells with platinum electrodes and the electrolyte melt). The formation of mixtures of hydrogen and oxygen gases as well as the water vapor was detected by Raman spectroscopy. In this way it was demonstrated that water is present in the new electrolyte: molten KH2PO4 can be split by electrolysis via the reaction 2H2O→2H2+O2 at temperatures ∼275–325°C. At these temperatures, before the start of the electrolysis, the KH2PO4 melt gives off H2O gas that pressurizes the cell according to the following dissociations: 2KH2PO4↔K2H2P2O7+H2O↔2KPO3+2H2O. The spectra show however that the water by virtue of hydrogen-bonding has a high affinity for remaining in the melt. The formed hydrogen and oxygen gasses were detected by means of the characteristic Raman gas-phase spectra.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aelectrodes 3aelectrolysis 3aelectrolytes 3aglass 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen bonding 3amelting 3amethane 3aoxygen 3aplatinum 3apotassium dihydrogen phosphate 3aquartz 3atemperature 3avapor pressure 3awater vapor 0aMolten salt electrolyte 0aKDP 0aElevated temperature water electrolysis 0aVapor pressure 0aPhosphate-based electrolytes 0aRaman spectroscopy 0aWater electrolysis1 aNikiforov, A.V.1 aPetrushina, I.M.1 aBjerrum, N.J.0 tApplied energy.g2016 Oct. 15, v. 180 p.269-275dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.07.1233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02541naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001900145245012400164300001400288500001100302520125200313592002801565650002901593650001901622650001701641650001101658650001301669650001001682650002401692650001801716650001401734650001101748650001401759700001701773700002101790700001601811700002301827700001801850700001901868773016501887856004602052852000902098655001202107IND50089405020221120052701.0140507e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008940502DNAL7 a10.1111/1574-6968.124262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNonaka, Minako10aAnalysis of a Lys‐specific serine endopeptidase secreted via the type IX secretion system in Porphyromonas gingivalis  ap. 60-68.  aLETTER  aPorphyromonas gingivalis, a significant causative agent of adult periodontitis, possesses a novel secretion system called the type IX secretion system (T9SS). A number of virulence factors, such as Arg‐gingipain (Rgp), are translocated onto the cell surface and into the extracellular milieu via the T9SS. In this study, we found that the PGN_1416 90‐ to 120‐kDa diffuse protein bands were located in the outer membrane fraction and that the presence of the bands was dependent on genes involved in the T9SS and the formation of anionic lipopolysaccharide (A‐LPS). These data strongly suggest that the PGN_1416 protein is secreted by the T9SS and anchored onto the cell surface by binding to A‐LPS. Enzymatic analysis using outer membrane fractions suggested that the PGN_1416 protein has a Lys‐specific serine endopeptidase activity and that its activation requires processing by Rgp. Homologues of the gene encoding PGN_1416, which is referred to as pepK, were found in bacteria belonging to the phyla Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria, whereas homologues encoding the C‐terminal domain, which is essential for T9SS‐mediated secretion, and the catalytic domain were only observed in bacteria belonging to the Bacteroidetes phylum.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPorphyromonas gingivalis 3aProteobacteria 3aactive sites 3aadults 3abacteria 3agenes 3alipopolysaccharides 3aperiodontitis 3asecretion 3aserine 3avirulence1 aShoji, Mikio1 aKadowaki, Tomoko1 aSato, Keiko1 aYukitake, Hideharu1 aNaito, Mariko1 aNakayama, Koji0 tFEMS microbiology letters.g2014 May, v. 354, no. 1 p.60-68dElsevier Science on behalf of the Federation of European Microbiological Societiesx0378-10977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1574-6968.12426  aDNAL 7aarticle03037naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100006100153245012300214520165500337592002801992650001302020650000902033650002402042650002502066650002202091650001502113650001202128650001402140650001402154650001302168650001302181650001302194650001702207651001202224651001202236653001702248653000902265653002202274653002102296700002202317700002302339773012002362856008802482852000902570655001202579IND60713949220221123023433.0210428e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071394922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.resconrec.2020.1051772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcMahon, Kathleen1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8014-098310aQuantifying used electrical and electronic equipment exported from ireland to west africa in roll-on roll-off vehicles  aThe investigation on the transboundary shipment of used and waste electrical and electronic equipment from developed countries is a well-studied subject with regard to the environmental and health impacts in the destination countries when it reaches end-of-life. Prior research has ranked Ireland the 8th highest source of used electrical and electronic equipment (UEEE) into Nigeria, with roll-on roll-off (RoRo) vehicles as the largest carrier (Odeyingbo 2017). This study presents the first comprehensive port of origin estimation of UEEE export shipments from Ireland in RoRo vehicles. This was obtained by using a ‘person in the port’ involving vehicle and enforcement document inspections at the Ringaskiddy port in Cork, Ireland. By scaling sampling data to annual shipment figures, it was estimated that 17,319 kg of UEEE are currently exported from Ireland annually and that around 1 in 5 vehicles exported contain UEEE. Additionally, the type of UEEE and frequency of shipments show certain equipment are high in demand at destination country. By using the Nigerian second-hand websites, the annual shipments were valued at approximately €147,225. The results obtained from this study suggests a significant reduction in UEEE exported from previous studies and highlights an opportunity for further research in additional ports of origin, as well as the examination of the shipping process, cost, and verification of functionality. Additionally, the straightforward methods provide better understandings of UEEE flows as this is significant to all stakeholders concerned with the regulation, enforcement, and safety of UEEE shipment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3acork 3adeveloped countries 3aelectronic equipment 3aelectronic wastes 3aestimation 3aexports 3afrequency 3arecycling 3aresearch 3asampling 3ashipping 3astakeholders 3aIreland 3aNigeria 0aUeee exports 0aWeee 0aElectronics reuse 0aPort inspections1 aUchendu, Chidinma1 aFitzpatrick, Colin0 tResources, conservation, and recycling.g2021 Jan., v. 164 p.105177-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11928x0921-34497nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2020.1051773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02373naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245011100167300001800278520104200296592002801338596005901366650002501425650001401450650003201464650001601496650002701512650001101539650001601550650001401566650002501580650001301605651001001618700001501628700001501643700001601658700001701674700005301691773011501744856008301859852000901942655001201951IND60777781720221119191038.0220521e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077778172DNAL7 a10.1007/s00705-022-05446-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yuxiang10aMolecular characterization of a novel alternavirus infecting the entomopathogenic fungus Cordyceps chanhua  ap. 1467-1470.  aIn this study, a novel double-stranded (ds) RNA mycovirus, named Cordyceps chanhua alternavirus 1 (CcAV1), was detected in the entomogenous fungus Cordyceps chanhua in China and characterized. The complete genome of CcAV1 is composed of three dsRNA segments: dsRNA 1 (3,512 bp), dsRNA 2 (2,655 bp), and dsRNA 3 (2,415 bp). Each of the three dsRNAs possesses a single open reading frame (ORF). dsRNA 1 encodes a putative RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), and dsRNA 2 and dsRNA 3 encode hypothetical protein 1 (HP 1) and hypothetical protein 2 (HP 2), respectively. The predicted amino acid sequences of the putative RdRp, HP 1, and HP 2 had the highest identity of 66.99%, 49.30%, and 56.91%, respectively, to those of Aspergillus foetidus dsRNA mycovirus. A maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree based on RdRp amino acid sequences showed that CcAV1 clustered with members of the proposed family “Alternaviridae”. Hence, we propose that Cordyceps chanhua alternavirus 1 is a novel member of the proposed family “Alternaviridae”.  aPublisher supplied data  a32172473cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aAspergillus foetidus 3aCordyceps 3aRNA-directed RNA polymerase 3aamino acids 3aentomopathogenic fungi 3agenome 3amycoviruses 3aphylogeny 3astatistical analysis 3avirology 3aChina1 aShi, Najie1 aWang, Ping1 aZhu, Qiuyan1 aYang, Guogen1 aHuang, Bo1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6032-73960 tArchives of virology.g2022 June, v. 167, no. 6 p.1467-1470dSpringer ViennawJournal:jnl6093x0304-86087nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00705-022-05446-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03390naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245008300160300001600243500002000259520176500279592002802044650002702072650002702099650002802126650001602154650002002170650001602190650001302206650002002219650001002239650002002249650001302269650002602282650001102308650001902319650004302338650002802381650001302409650001902422650001302441650002202454650001102476650001202487700002002499700001802519700001902537700002002556700002002576700001902596700001602615773009902631856007302730852000902803655001202812IND60572218220221119110354.0170712e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057221822DNAL7 a10.1111/mec.138752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKusakabe, Makoto10aGenetic basis for variation in salinity tolerance between stickleback ecotypes  ap. 304-319.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAdaptation to different salinities can drive and maintain divergence between populations of aquatic organisms. Anadromous and stream ecotypes of threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) are an excellent model to explore the genetic mechanisms underlying osmoregulation divergence. Using a parapatric pair of anadromous and stream stickleback ecotypes, we employed an integrated genomic approach to identify candidate genes important for adaptation to different salinity environments. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping of plasma sodium concentrations under a seawater challenge experiment identified a significant QTL on chromosome 16. To identify candidate genes within this QTL, we first conducted RNA‐seq and microarray analysis on gill tissue to find ecotypic differences in gene expression that were associated with plasma Na⁺ levels. This resulted in the identification of ten candidate genes. Quantitative PCR analysis on gill tissue of additional Japanese stickleback populations revealed that the majority of the candidate genes showed parallel divergence in expression levels. Second, we conducted whole‐genome sequencing and found five genes that are predicted to have functionally important amino acid substitutions. Finally, we conducted genome scan analysis and found that eight of these candidate genes were located in genomic islands of high differentiation, suggesting that they may be under divergent selection. The candidate genes included those involved in ATP synthesis and hormonal signalling, whose expression or amino acid changes may underlie the variation in salinity tolerance. Further functional molecular analysis of these genes will reveal the causative genetic and genomic changes underlying divergent adaptation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGasterosteus aculeatus 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aamino acid substitution 3aamino acids 3aanadromous fish 3achromosomes 3aecotypes 3agene expression 3agenes 3agenomic islands 3agenomics 3amicroarray technology 3amodels 3aosmoregulation 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aquantitative trait loci 3asalinity 3asalt tolerance 3aseawater 3asequence analysis 3asodium 3astreams1 aIshikawa, Asano1 aRavinet, Mark1 aYoshida, Kohta1 aMakino, Takashi1 aToyoda, Atsushi1 aFujiyama, Asao1 aKitano, Jun0 tMolecular ecology.g2017 Jan., v. 26, no. 1 p.304-319dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0962-10837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mec.138753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02470naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001600149245015200165520105100317592002801368650000801396650002701404650002101431650002701452650001901479650001901498650002001517650001701537650001901554650001501573650001101588650001301599650001601612653003901628653002601667653002201693653002401715700001401739700001401753700001201767700001601779700001701795773009501812856008401907852000901991655001202000IND60635277520221120114300.0190523e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063527752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.algal.2019.1014792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLv, Junping10aExtraction of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) from a newly isolated self-flocculating microalga Neocystis mucosa SX with different methods  aExtracellular polymeric substances (EPS) played an important role in flocculation of microalgae. Nevertheless, no universal method was reported for EPS extraction from microalgae. In the study, a microalga with high self-flocculating efficiency was isolated and identified as Neocystis mucosa SX. Then the efficiency of extracting EPS from the microalga using cation exchange resin (CER), heating, EDTA, acidic treatment and alkaline treatment were compared. Both CER and heating treatment extracted more EPS with rich chemical groups than other three methods. Moreover, it was favorable for EPS extraction by prolonging treatment time for CER method and raising temperature for heating treatment. Nevertheless, long treatment time for CER method and high temperature for heating treatment resulted in severe cell lysis through the analysis of DNA content, dehydrogenase activity (DHA) and the cell membrane integrity. Based on both EPS extraction efficiency and cell viability, the CER extraction for 6 h could be applied for the actual study.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aEDTA (chelating agent) 3aalkali treatment 3acation exchange resins 3acell membranes 3acell viability 3aenzyme activity 3aflocculation 3aheat treatment 3amicroalgae 3amucosa 3apolymers 3atemperature 0aExtracellular polymeric substances 0aCation exchange resin 0aHeating treatment 0aNeocystis mucosa SX1 aZhao, Fei1 aFeng, Jia1 aLiu, Qi1 aNan, Fangru1 aXie, Shulian0 tAlgal research.g2019 June, v. 40 p.101479-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12360x2211-92647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.algal.2019.1014793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02880naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100002000181245013400201300001800335506007600353520123000429592002801659506003701687650001601724650001101740650001501751650001701766650001601783650001801799650001001817650001601827650001901843650001401862650001901876650001301895650001301908650001401921653002101935653001701956653001801973653002301991653002402014700001902038700002202057700002302079700002202102700001802124773010102142856007402243852000902317655001202326IND60132649320221207110208.0150511e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013264932DNAL7 a10.1093/gbe/evv0602doi7 aPMC44198062pmcid7 a258404162pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKamikawa, Ryoma10aPlastid Genome-Based Phylogeny Pinpointed the Origin of the Green-Colored Plastid in the Dinoflagellate Lepidodinium chlorophorum  ap. 1133-1140.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aUnlike many other photosynthetic dinoflagellates, whose plastids contain a characteristic carotenoid peridinin, members of the genus Lepidodinium are the only known dinoflagellate species possessing green alga-derived plastids. However, the precise origin of Lepidodinium plastids has hitherto remained uncertain. In this study, we completely sequenced the plastid genome of Lepidodinium chlorophorum NIES-1868 . Our phylogenetic analyses of 52 plastid-encoded proteins unite L. chlorophorum exclusively with a pedinophyte, Pedinomonas minor , indicating that the green-colored plastids in Lepidodinium spp. were derived from an endosymbiotic pedinophyte or a green alga closely related to pedinophytes. Our genome comparison incorporating the origin of the Lepidodinium plastids strongly suggests that the endosymbiont plastid genome acquired by the ancestral Lepidodinium species has lost genes encoding proteins involved in metabolism and biosynthesis, protein/metabolite transport, and plastid division during the endosymbiosis. We further discuss the commonalities and idiosyncrasies in genome evolution between the L. chlorophorum plastid and other plastids acquired through endosymbiosis of eukaryotic photoautotrophs.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aChlorophyta 3aMiozoa 3aautotrophs 3abiosynthesis 3acarotenoids 3aendosymbionts 3agenes 3ametabolites 3aphotosynthesis 3aphylogeny 3aplastid genome 3aplastids 3aproteins 3asymbiosis 0agenome reduction 0aLepidodinium 0aPedinophyceae 0asecondary plastids 0aplastid replacement1 aTanifuji, Goro1 aKawachi, Masanobu1 aMiyashita, Hideaki1 aHashimoto, Tetsuo1 aInagaki, Yuji0 tGenome Biology and Evolution.g2015 Apr., v. 7, no. 4 p.1133-1140dOxford University Press7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/gbe/evv0603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02136naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002100143245008600164300001600250520093300266592002801199650001701227650001101244650001801255650001201273650002001285650001501305650001101320653001501331653001701346653006601363653003401429653003801463653002501501773015001526856007701676852000901753655001201762IND60521727020221120223814.0160531e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052172702DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1984-02232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBacher, Adelbert10aBiosynthesis of Riboflavin Preparation of Phosphorylated Pyrimidine Intermediates  ap. 252-258.  a2-Amino-5-nitro-6-(1'-D -ribityl)amino-4(3H)-pyrim idinone (6a) was converted to the dimethoxytrityl derivative, which was subsequently acetylated.

The modification of the co-precipitation hydrolysis method with Triton X surfactants results in the formation of crystalline polyhedral particles. The particles are herein termed iron oxide “nanobricks” (IONBs) as the variety of particles made are all variations on a simple “brick-like” rhombohedral shape as evaluated by TEM. These IONBs can be easily coated with hydrophilic silane ligands, allowing them to be dispersed in aqueous media. The dispersed particles are investigated for potential applications as hyperthermia and T₂ MRI contrast agents. The results demonstrate that the IONBs perform better than comparable spherical IONPs in both applications, and show r₂ values amongst the highest for iron oxide based materials reported in the literature.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acoprecipitation 3afever 3ahydrolysis 3ahydrophilicity 3airon oxides 3aligands 3amagnetic resonance imaging 3ananoparticles 3asilane 3asurfactants 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aBruckman, Michael A.1 aKim, Min-ho,1 aSteinmetz, Nicole F.1 aKikkawa, James M.1 aLaSpina, Catherine1 aHegmann, Torsten0 tJournal of materials chemistry B.g2015 Aug. 19, v. 3, no. 34 p.6877-6884dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26902x2050-75187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5tb01138h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03602naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245007800164300001600242520181600258592002802074650001502102650002002117650002302137650001902160650002902179650001502208650001702223650002602240650002202266650001302288650002502301650002202326650001802348650001402366650001302380650001602393650002802409650001302437650001302450651001002463653002302473653003602496653002502532653001802557700001502575700001602590700002302606700001702629700001902646700001202665700001702677700001402694700002002708700001902728700001902747773010402766856008502870852000902955655001202964IND60630925820221120110850.0200110e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063092582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envint.2019.01.0762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Juan10aThallium pollution in China and removal technologies for waters: A review  ap. 771-790.  aThallium (Tl) is a typical toxic metal, which poses a great threat to human health through drinking water and the food chain (biomagnification). China has rich Tl-bearing mineral resources, which have been extensively explored and utilized, leading to release of large amounts of Tl into the environment. However, research on Tl pollution and removal techniques is relatively limited, because Tl has not been listed within the scope of environmental monitoring in China for several decades. This paper reviewed Tl pollution in wastewater arising from various industries in China, as well as the latest available methods for treating Tl-containing industrial wastewater, in order to give an outlook on effective technologies for controlling Tl pollution. Conventional physical and chemical treatment technologies are efficient at removing trace amounts of Tl, but it proved to be difficult to achieve the stringent environmental standard (≤0.1–5 μg/L) cost-effectively. Adsorption by using newly developed nanomaterials, and metal oxide modified polymer materials and microbial fuel cells are highly promising and expected to become next-generation technologies for remediation of Tl pollution. With the potential for greater Tl contamination in the environment under accelerated growth of industrialization, researches based on lab-scale implementation of such promising treatment technologies should be further expanded to pilot and industrial scale, ensuring environmental protection and the safety of drinking water for sustainable development. Comprehensive insights into experiences of Tl pollution in China and in-depth perspectives on new frontier technologies of Tl removal from wastewaters will also benefit other nations/regions worldwide, which are susceptible to high exposure to Tl likewise.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3abioaccumulation 3achemical treatment 3adrinking water 3aenvironmental monitoring 3afood chain 3ahuman health 3aindustrial wastewater 3aindustrialization 3aindustry 3amicrobial fuel cells 3amineral resources 3ananomaterials 3apollution 3apolymers 3aremediation 3asustainable development 3athallium 3atoxicity 3aChina 0aThallium pollution 0aIndustrial wastewater treatment 0aAnthropogenic source 0aNanomaterials1 aLuo, Xuwen1 aSun, Yuqing1 aTsang, Daniel C.W.1 aQi, Jianying1 aZhang, Weilong1 aLi, Nuo1 aYin, Meiling1 aWang, Jin1 aLippold, Holger1 aChen, Yongheng1 aSheng, Guodong0 tEnvironment international.g2019 May, v. 126 p.771-790dElsevier LtdwJournal:6374x0160-41207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2019.01.0763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03800naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006100140245018700201300001800388500002000406520197700426592002802403596005302431650001302484650002802497650001102525650001002536650002402546650002102570650001702591650001802608650002302626650001102649650000902660650000902669650001502678650001402693650001602707651001002723700001902733700002902752700002502781700002402806700001802830700001802848700002502866700002302891700002202914700002302936700002202959700002102981773013603002856007503138852000903213655001203222IND60776378820221118054858.0220505e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077637882DNAL7 a10.1111/tbed.141082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRetamal, Patricio1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8597-955010aVaccination of Holstein heifers with Mycobacterium bovis BCG strain induces protection against bovine tuberculosis and higher milk production yields in a natural transmission setting  ap. 1419-1425.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBovine tuberculosis (TB) is a chronic disease caused mainly by Mycobacterium bovis, a zoonotic pathogen that has a worldwide distribution causing serious economic losses for milk and meat producers. In Chile, the disease in dairy cattle has a heterogeneous distribution, where the Metropolitan Region concentrates the highest animal prevalence and the main challenge for the national control and eradication programme. In this epidemiological context, vaccination with the M. bovis Bacillus Calmette–Guerin (BCG) vaccine might be a useful strategy for disease prevention and control. The objective of this study was to assess the efficacy and impacts on productivity and fertility of vaccination with the BCG Russia strain in 11 month‐old heifers from a dairy farm, under a natural transmission condition. Sixty‐two animals were vaccinated via the subcutaneous route with the equivalent of one human dose of BCG, and 60 control animals received saline. Subsequently, blood sampling was performed at 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 and 18 months post‐inoculation, and infection status was determined using the IFNγ release assay (IGRA) with the DIVA (differentiate infected from vaccinated animals) antigens ESAT‐6, CFP‐10 and Rv3615c. Efficacy was calculated as the percentage of reduction in the incidence of infection attributable to vaccination, which showed a statistically significant level of overall protection of 66.5%. No adverse effects on fertility and production were recorded. In contrast, we observed beneficial effects of vaccination on several milk production parameters, with the milk yield in the first 100 days after calving in the BCG group significantly higher compared to unvaccinated heifers (p < .05). These results suggest that BCG vaccination of heifers in a natural transmission setting might result in both sanitary and productive benefits, supporting its implementation as a new strategy for TB prevention in a high prevalence area of Chile.  aPublisher supplied data  cSAG‐FAVET collaboration and transfer agreement 3aHolstein 3aMycobacterium bovis BCG 3aRussia 3ablood 3abovine tuberculosis 3achronic diseases 3adairy cattle 3adairy farming 3adisease prevention 3ahumans 3ameat 3amilk 3amilk yield 3apathogens 3avaccination 3aChile1 aÁbalos, Pedro1 aAlegría‐Morán, Raúl1 aValdivieso, Nicolás1 aVordermeier, Martin1 aJones, Gareth1 aSaadi, Karina1 aPerez Watt, Carolina1 aSalinas, Constanza1 aÁvila, Constanza1 aPadilla, Valentina1 aBenavides, Belén1 aOrellana, Romina0 tTransboundary and emerging diseases.g2022 May, v. 69, no. 3 p.1419-1425dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl58702x1865-16747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/tbed.141083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01999naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100000700141245014700148300001600295520085600311592002801167650001501195650002001210650000901230650001201239650001501251650002001266653001701286653001901303653001501322653002301337653002801360700000701388700000701395773013701402856007701539852000901616655001201625IND60516537020221117204456.0160326e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051653702DNAL7 a10.1638/2015-0040.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 a, 10aEstablishment of reference intervals for hematology and biochemistry analytes in a captive colony of straw-colored fruit bats (eidolon helvum)  ap. 106-112.  aStraw-colored fruit bats (Eidolon helvum) are an ecologically important species of megachiropteran bat that are common both in captivity and in the wild. This study attempts to determine reference intervals from a group of 45 captive individuals for a variety of hematologic and biochemistry parameters. Most of the values are similar to values previously seen in other pteropodid bat species. Differences included a lower than expected reference interval for the total white blood cell count, a wider reference interval for glucose, and a higher reference interval for 25-hydroxyvitamin D. Establishing reference intervals for hematologic and biochemistry analytes for bats that were maintained on the same diet and under the same husbandry parameters for several years will help in the future assessment of other bats maintained in a similar manner.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChiroptera 3acaptive animals 3adiet 3aglucose 3ahematology 3aleukocyte count 0aBiochemistry 0aEidolon helvum 0ahematology 0areference interval 0astraw-colored fruit bat1 a, 1 a, 0 tJournal of zoo and wildlife medicine.g2016 Mar., v. 47, no. 1 p.106-112dAmerican Association of Zoo Veterinariansx1042-72607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1638%2F2015-0040.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02900naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245013200174300001600306520149500322592002801817650002001845650001301865650001201878650001101890650001501901650002101916650002201937650001501959650001001974650001301984650002501997650002002022650002202042651001102064653002002075653002702095653002502122653001702147653001902164700002302183700002202206773010602228856008702334852000902421655001202430IND60536151820221120211559.0190409e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053615182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biombioe.2014.01.0512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKuntashula, Elias12aA pro-poor biofuel? Household wealth and farmer participation in Jatropha curcas seed production and exchange in eastern Zambia  ap. 187-197.  aWhen a new crop is being promoted as a pro-poor, like in the case of Jatropha curcas (J. curcas) in Zambian rural communities, it is pertinent to explore factors that might affect its adoption, on not only homogenous groups but also heterogeneous wealth categories. This is because poorer farmers may be reluctant to invest in any untried innovations mainly due to their limited factors of production. Evidence from a household survey of 249 randomly selected farmers in eastern Zambia indicates that some factors that affect the farmers in embracing J. curcas seed production and exchange activities differ according to wealth. While factors related to household labour availability were crucial to involvement in J. curcas collection and exchange activities among poorest farmers, it was gender of the household heads and access to off-farm income that significantly influenced these activities among the well endowed farmers. Results further indicate that the farmers who are relatively well endowed are the ones most likely to benefit more from J. curcas collection and selling activities. Well endowed households harvested more seed from hedges because they have more labour and currently harvesting of seed is not restricted to private hedges. Further evidence show that even with fewer household members, the poorly endowed could be involved in planting of hedges. This is an avenue that can help the poorest farmers especially when property rights over J. curcas hedges are secured.  aPublisher supplied data 3aJatropha curcas 3abiofuels 3afarmers 3agender 3aharvesting 3ahousehold income 3ahousehold surveys 3ahouseholds 3alabor 3aplanting 3aproduction economics 3aproperty rights 3arural communities 3aZambia 0aBiofuels policy 0aJatropha curcas hedges 0aFarmer participation 0aWealth index 0aEastern Zambia1 avan der Horst, Dan1 aVermeylen, Saskia0 tBiomass and bioenergy.g2014 Apr., v. 63 p.187-197dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl3929140x0961-95347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biombioe.2014.01.0513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03644naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001800142245007800160300001800238520197200256592002802228650000802256650001302264650001502277650001802292650001402310650002302324650001602347650001302363650001402376650001202390650001302402650001302415650001202428650001202440650001302452650001202465650001402477650002502491650000702516650003002523650001402553650001102567650001802578650001302596650002202609650002002631650001202651650001602663651002002679700001902699700001302718700001602731700002002747773017802767856007602945852000903021655001203030IND60132649720221119142347.0150511e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013264972DNAL7 a10.1099/ijs.0.0000662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDai, Xiaofeng10a Salipiger nanhaiensis sp. nov., a bacterium isolated from deep sea water  ap. 1122-1126.  aA Gram-stain-negative, facultatively anaerobic, chemoheterotrophic, moderately halophilic, exopolysaccharide (EPS)-producing, cream, non-motile and rod-shaped bacterium, designated strain ZH114 ᵀ, was isolated from deep water of the South China Sea, and was subjected to a polyphasic taxonomic study. Phylogenetic analysis, based on 16S rRNA gene sequences, indicated that this strain belongs to the genus Salipiger with the highest sequence similarity to Salipiger mucescens LMG 22090 ᵀ (96.83 %), followed by Pseudodonghicola xiamenensis LMG 24574 ᵀ (96.12 %). Growth occurred at 4–37 °C (optimum 32 °C), pH 6.0–10.0 (optimum pH 9.0–10.0) and in the presence of 0–19 % NaCl (w/v) (optimum 6 %, w/v). It did not produce poly-β-hydroxyalkanoate granules or bacteriochlorophyll a . Acid was produced from glycerol, erythrose, ribose, d -xylose, galactose, glucose, fructose, mannitol, cellobiose, maltose, lactose, melibiose, turanose, d -lyxose, d -tagatose, d -fucose, d -arabitol and l -arabitol after inoculating for 24 h and weakly positive results were also detected after 48 h in API 50CH strips with d -arabinose, l -arabinose, l -xylose, adonitol, mannose, aesculin, salicin, sucrose, mycose and l -fucose. The predominant fatty acids were C ₁₈ : ₁ω7 c and/or C ₁₈ : ₁ω6 c , C ₁₆ : ₀, C ₁₈ : ₀ and 11-methyl C ₁₈ : ₁ω7 c . The major polar lipids of ZH114 ᵀ were phosphatidylglycerol, diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine and two unidentified lipids. The major respiratory quinone was ubiquinone Q-10. The genomic DNA G+C content of strain ZH114 ᵀ was 63.8 mol%. Based on this phenotypic, chemotaxonomic and phylogenetic analysis, strain ZH114 ᵀ should be classified as a representative of a novel species of the genus Salipiger , for which the name Salipiger nanhaiensis sp. nov. is proposed.

When visiting a familiar food source, the ants steer some distance downwind of the feeder, rather than attempting a direct approach that might miss small food sources, in particular. In the downwind area, the ants pick up the odor plume emanating from the food and follow it upwind to the prey. This strategy saves considerable walking distance and time. The additional path necessitated by the downwind strategy is only about 0.75 to 2 m, depending on nest–feeder distance, while missing the food on the upwind side results in much longer search trajectories. During the initial three to five visits to a feeding site, downwind distance and length of the approach path are shortened notably, and the approach trajectory is straightened. Desert ants further exhibit considerable short-term flexibility in their approach. Experienced individuals are evidently able to decide upon leaving the nest which direction to choose toward the feeder, depending on current wind direction (that fluctuates slightly during the day). Notable changes in wind direction occur primarily overnight.

Twelve clinically healthy brown bears were selected based on their normal physical examination, hematologic, and serum biochemistry results. These bears were divided into two groups based on age; subadult (<5 yr, n = 4) and adult (≥5 yr, n = 8). After the chemical immobilization (ketamine and xylazine), routine clinical and laboratory examinations were performed. Also, cardiologic examinations were performed using electrocardiogram and echocardiogram. There were no significant differences for the clinical parameters between the two groups including for body temperature, heart and respiratory rates, capillary refilling time, and oxygen saturation. The Q, R, and S wave (QRS) complexes and T wave amplitude were higher (P < 0.05) in the subadult group when compared to those of adult bears. Notching of QRS complexes and peaked T wave were also observed in both groups. Left ventricular diameter at systole and diastole in adult bears was wider (P < 0.05) than that of subadult bears. Subadult bears had reduced aortic diameter compared to adult bears (P < 0.05). Doppler variables of mitral, tricuspid, and aortic inflows between groups were similar; however, pulmonary artery variables such as flow velocity integral, mean velocity, and gradient were higher (P < 0.05) in the subadult group. These results suggest that electrocardiographic and echocardiographic parameters should be evaluated based on the age of brown bears.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUrsus arctos 3aadults 3abiochemistry 3ablood serum 3abody temperature 3aclinical examination 3aechocardiography 3aelectrocardiography 3aheart 3aketamine 3aoxygen 3apulmonary artery 3arespiratory rate 3aturkeys 3axylazine 0aCardiac 0aechocardiography 0aelectrocardiography 0aEurasian brown bear 0aUrsus arctos arctos1 a, 1 a, 0 tJournal of zoo and wildlife medicine.g2016 Mar., v. 47, no. 1 p.120-126dAmerican Association of Zoo Veterinariansx1042-72607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1638%2F2015-0056.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02238naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002300143245025500166300001600421520074200437592002801179650002301207650001301230650001401243650004401257650001501301650002001316650001401336653003901350653007201389653005001461653005601511653005601567700001801623773013701641856007701778852000901855655001201864IND60521727520221120223720.0160531e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052172752DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1984-03022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBäudler, Marianne10aBeiträge zur Chemie des Phosphors, 135 [1].

A strategy for the enrichment or isolation of polycyclic organophosphanes PₙRₘ (m < n) from complex reaction mixtures is described. The structures of the above mentioned compounds have been unambiguously clarified by ³¹P NMR spectroscopy or X-ray structure analysis.

This traditional process involves steeping whole-kernel corn in an alkaline solution overnight and then grinding the corn into dough (masa), which is then baked. While the masa is held before baking, significant microbial change can occur which leads to fermentation and spoilage. The objective of this research was to characterize and identify the microflora of nixtamalized corn masa from six different commercial tortilla mills throughout Guadalajara, Mexico. The identification of samples was conducted using the microbial identification system (MIS), which analyzes cellular fatty acids via gas chromatography to identify bacterial species. Lactic acid bacteria and aerobic mesophiles were the predominant organisms, with both groups having counts ranging from 104 to 107cfu/g across all mills. Coliform populations were observed at counts of 102 to 103cfu/g, while yeast and mold counts were typically less than 101cfu/g. Some mills showed no presence of coliforms or yeast or mold. Streptococcus bovis and Lactobacillus oris were isolated from all mills, and were the most prevalent organisms representing 43% and 17% of all lactic acid bacteria isolated, respectively. S. bovis was also isolated on the aerobic tryptic soy plates and was the most prevalent species representing 19% of the total organisms from these aerobic plates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLactobacillus oris 3aStreptococcus bovis 3acoliform bacteria 3acorn 3adiet 3adough 3afatty acids 3afermentation 3agas chromatography 3alactic acid bacteria 3amasa 3anixtamalization 3aspoilage 3atortillas 3atraditional technology 3ayeasts 3aMexico 0aMicroflora 0aMasa 0aCorn 0aNixtamalization 0aLactic acid bacteria1 aDunn, Michael L.1 aJefferies, Laura K.1 aSteele, Frost M.0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2013 Aug. 01, v. 165, no. 3 p.209-213dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl35565x0168-16057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2013.05.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02564naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245009700168520116000265592002801425650000901453650001201462650000901474650001501483650001801498650001401516650001801530650002101548650001301569650001101582650001001593650001801603650001401621650001301635650002301648650001501671650002001686650001701706653003201723653001901755653001801774653002001792700002701812700001901839773012201858856008101980852000902061655001202070IND60704707620221122053402.0220103e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070470762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2020.1099312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPaesani, Candela10aEffect of extrusion of whole-grain maize flour on the characteristics of gluten-free cookies  aA gluten-free diet is usually lacking in dietary fibre and minerals present in the bran and germ of grains. The aim of this work was to study the effects of different extrusion processes of whole grain maize flours (to avoid early rancidity development of the flours) in gluten-free cookies. Particle size and hydration capacity of the flours, rheology of the doughs, physicochemical characteristics, fibre content and sensorial analysis of the cookies were evaluated. The presence of whole-grain flours increased the particle size and the water absorption values. The elastic and viscoelastic modulus of the doughs decreased, allowing a greater expansion of the cookies in the oven, resulting in cookies with a higher spread ratio (reaching values of up to 12.2) and a lower hardness (decreasing in all cases more than 25% in relation to the Control). Cookies prepared with whole grain flours presented higher values of dietary fibre (< 8.4g/100g of lipid free cookie) and had a good acceptability. The extrusion of whole-grain maize flour has a positive impact on both in the shelf life of the flour (slower rancidity development) and in cookie quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3abran 3acookies 3acorn 3acorn flour 3adietary fiber 3aextrusion 3afiber content 3agluten-free diet 3ahardness 3alipids 3aovens 3aparticle size 3arancidity 3arheology 3asensory evaluation 3ashelf life 3aviscoelasticity 3awater uptake 0aGluten-free bakery products 0aCookie quality 0aDietary fiber 0aFlour extrusion1 aBravo-Núñez, Ángela1 aGomez, Manuel,0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2020 Oct., v. 132 p.109931-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2020.1099313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02551naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245008300170300001800253520127300271592002801544650001501572650002801587650002101615650001901636650001901655650001101674650001101685650002801696650002001724650002001744650001801764650001101782650001701793700001901810700002001829700001401849700006001863773011301923856008402036852000902120655001202129IND60683814820200407000000.0200211e20200117xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068381482DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.9b037932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchäfer, Jonas10aLeaflet-Dependent Distribution of PtdIns[4,5]P₂ in Supported Model Membranes  ap. 1320-1328.  aSupported planar lipid bilayers (SLBs) prepared by spreading of unilamellar vesicles on hydrophilic substrates such as silicon dioxide are frequently used to investigate lipid–protein interactions by means of surface-sensitive methods. In recent years, the receptor lipid phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns[4,5]P₂) became particularly important as a significant number of proteins bind to this lipid at the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane. Here, we investigated how the lipid PtdIns[4,5]P₂ distributes between the two leaflets of an SLB on SiO₂ surfaces. We prepared SLBs on SiO₂ by spreading small unilamellar vesicles and quantified the adsorption of PtdIns[4,5]P₂ binding proteins providing information about the accessibility of PtdIns[4,5]P₂. We compared protein binding to PtdIns[4,5]P₂ in SLBs with that in lipid monolayers on a 1,1,1-trimethyl-N-(trimethylsilyl)silanamine-functionalized SiO₂ surface using reflectometric interference spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy. Our results clearly demonstrate that the accessibility of PtdIns[4,5]P₂ for protein binding is reduced in SLBs compared to that in supported hybrid membranes, which is discussed in terms of PtdIns[4,5]P₂ distribution in the two leaflets of SLBs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aatomic force microscopy 3abinding proteins 3ahydrophilicity 3alipid bilayers 3alipids 3amodels 3aorganosilicon compounds 3aplasma membrane 3aprotein binding 3areflectometry 3asilica 3aspectroscopy1 aNehls, Jessica1 aSchön, Markus,1 aMey, Ingo1 aSteinem, Claudia1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8778-92830 tLangmuir.g2020 Jan. 17, v. 36, no. 5 p.1320-1328dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19170x1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.9b037933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02490naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001300148245010000161300001800261520124600279592002801525596008501553596008401638596007401722650003001796650001101826650001401837650000901851650001001860650001701870700001801887700001801905773012501923856008302048852000902131655001202140IND60778493120221121044928.0220528e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077849312DNAL7 a10.1007/s11269-022-03144-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Juan13aAn Accurate Leakage Localization Method for Water Supply Network Based on Deep Learning Network  ap. 2309-2325.  aIn the water supply network, leakage of pipes will cause water loss and increase the risk of environmental pollution. For water supply systems, identifying the leak point can improve the efficiency of pipeline leak repair. Most existing leak location methods can only locate the leak point approximately at the node or pipe section of the pipe network but cannot locate the specific location of the pipe section. This paper presents a framework for accurate water supply network leakage location based on Residual Network (ResNet). This study proposes a leak localization idea with a parallel classification and regression process that enables the framework to pinpoint the exact position of leak points in the pipeline. Furthermore, a multi-supervision mechanism is designed in the regression process to speed up the model’s convergence. For a pipe network containing 40 pipes, the positioning accuracy of the pipe section is 0.94, and the MSE of the specific location of the leakage point is 0.000435. For the pipe network containing 117 pipes, the positioning accuracy of the pipe section is 0.91. The MSE of the specific location of the leakage point is 0.0009177. Experiments confirm the robustness and applicability of the framework.  aPublisher supplied data  aGrant No. JJKH20200983KJcDepartment of Science and Technology of Jilin Province  aGrant No. 20190303082SFcDepartment of Science and Technology of Jilin Province  aGrant No. 20200201046JCcNatural Science Foundation of Jilin Province 3aadministrative management 3amodels 3apollution 3arisk 3awater 3awater supply1 aZheng, Wenjun1 aLu, Changgang0 tWater resources management.g2022 May, v. 36, no. 7 p.2309-2325dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl44305x0920-47417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11269-022-03144-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01861naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005100150245010000201520064000301592002800941650002100969650001400990650003701004653001501041653002001056653001801076653002601094653002201120700005601142700001601198700001401214700005701228700001801285773010201303856008501405852000901490655001201499IND60736336820221120162551.0211114e20210622xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073633682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2021.1531372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Tao1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0036-470412aA simple and efficient total synthesis of anticancer indole alkaloids TMC-205 and its analogues  aA concise synthesis of TMC-205 was accomplished in two steps via a protecting-group-free (PGF) and redox-economical strategy.

In plants, plasmodesmata (PD) provide a unique pathway for cell-to-cell communication. PD interconnect most cells and generate a cytoplasmic continuum, allowing the trafficking of various micro- and macromolecules between cells. This molecular trafficking through PD is dynamically regulated by altering PD permeability dependent on environmental changes, thereby leading to an appropriate response to various stresses; however, how PD permeability is dynamically regulated is still largely unknown. Moreover, studies on the regulation of PD permeability have been conducted primarily in a limited number of angiosperms. Here, we studied the regulation of PD permeability in the moss Physcomitrella patens and report that molecular trafficking through PD is rapidly and reversibly restricted by abscisic acid (ABA). Since ABA plays a key role in various stress responses in the moss, PD permeability can be controlled by ABA to adapt to surrounding environmental changes. This ABA-dependent restriction of PD trafficking correlates with a reduction in PD pore size. Furthermore, we also found that the rate of macromolecular trafficking is higher in an ABA-synthesis defective mutant, suggesting that the endogenous level of ABA is also important for PD-mediated macromolecular trafficking. Thus, our study provides compelling evidence that P. patens exploits ABA as one of the key regulators of PD function.  aPublisher supplied data  cRIKENdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100006264  cINAMORI FOUNDATION  a25650089cJSPS KAKENHI  aJP17H06473cScientific Research on Innovative Areas 3aAngiospermae 3aPhyscomitrella patens 3aabscisic acid 3acell communication 3amosses and liverworts 3amutants 3apermeability 3aplasmodesmata 3aporosity 3astress response 0aCell-to-cell communication 0aDendra21 aTomoi, Takumi1 aFukushima, Tomoki1 aSakata, Yoichi1 aSato, Mayuko1 aToyooka, Kiminori1 aFujita, Tomomichi1 aSakakibara, Hitoshi0 tPlant & cell physiology.g2019 Apr. 01, v. 60, no. 4 p.738-751dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl50549x1471-90537nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/pcp/pcy2493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03977naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245012700170300001600297520249700313592002802810650001702838650002302855650001502878650001102893650002202904650001502926650002202941650001502963650001502978650001502993650001903008650001503027650001703042650001303059651001303072653002203085653002403107653002503131653001703156653002203173653001303195653002603208700001903234700002503253773009903278856008503377852000903462655001203471IND60635278220221120114336.0190416e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063527822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoser.2018.02.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlexander, K.A.14aThe power of consensus: Developing a community voice in land use planning and tourism development in biodiversity hotspots  ap. 350-361.  aIn regions rich in natural resources, nature-based tourism is advancing rapidly. This form of development is identified as an important economic opportunity for local communities but can impact ecosystem services through rapid landscape transformation, threatening the livelihoods of the most impoverished sectors of a community. While it is accepted that communities should participate in the planning process, variation in community and household-level landscape dependencies and priorities can create a fractured viewpoint that is difficult to integrate into the land planning process. Power structures and special interests can subvert participatory processes and input at the community level. In the Chobe District, Northern Botswana, tourism, and other related developments had occurred at a rapid pace around the Chobe National Park creating access barriers, in some instances, to essential natural resource areas. We evaluate community landscape dependencies and participatory approaches to the development of inclusive land use maps. Spatial information on land use dependencies from household surveys were used to form the bases of reiterative village-level participatory mapping exercises (n = 179 households, six villages). The activities were conducted through traditional leadership structures. Landscape dependencies were widespread across study villages in both natural resource and agricultural sectors. Cluster and CART analysis of household data identified important variation in landscape dependencies between and within study villages. Fishing was the most important factor predicting gender of headship with male-headed households using this resource more frequently. Spatial data from these household consultations were used to create a draft map that was reiteratively refined through participatory map building exercises until final approval was provided by community members and their traditional leaders in a village. Scaled consultations and involvement of the traditional leadership limited the ability of power structures to control the process and/or subvert the interests of more vulnerable members of a community. Mapping outputs were later successfully used in land planning exercises and consultations. Development of inclusive community consensus on landscape dependencies should be undertaken before lucrative tourism ventures and land allocations are advanced in competition to the needs of more vulnerable and often voiceless sectors of a community.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3aecosystem services 3aecotourism 3agender 3ahousehold surveys 3ahouseholds 3aland use planning 3alandscapes 3aleadership 3alivelihood 3anational parks 3aprediction 3aspatial data 3avillages 3aBotswana 0aParticipatory GIS 0aWetlands management 0aNature-based tourism 0aBiodiversity 0aRural livelihoods 0aBotswana 0aAfrica sustainability1 aRamotadima, M.1 aSanderson, Claire E.0 tEcosystem services.g2018 Apr., v. 30 p.350-361dElsevier B.V.wJournal:21609x2212-04167nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoser.2018.02.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02195naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002500152245012100177300001800298520087600316592002801192650001701220650003401237650001301271650001501284650002301299650001801322650001501340650001901355650001301374650001601387650004401403650000901447650001001456700002301466700001801489700002501507700004001532773013701572856005501709852000901764655001201773IND4510048820221119181213.0150730e20010601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND451004882DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1432-1327.2001.02196.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMattos, Katherine A.10aStructure of an acidic exopolysaccharide produced by the diazotrophic endophytic bacterium Burkholderia brasiliensis  ap. 3174-3179.  aThe structure of an exopolysaccharide (EPS) produced by Burkholderia brasiliensis, a diazotrophic endophytic organism originally isolated from rice roots, has been determined.

Nonmonotonic diffusivity–loading relationships that depend on the pore sizes were observed, which can be explained by the spatial distribution of adsorbates at different loadings. For one of the MOFs in the series, NU-1000-M, the diffusivity–loading relationship is almost identical to the previously reported results of n-hexane diffusion in the hierarchical self-pillared pentasil (SPP) zeolite. Detailed analysis revealed that the similarity results from their similar micropore and window sizes, which was confirmed by free-energy mapping. The effects of temperature and adsorbate chain length on the diffusion were also studied, which supported our conclusion that the diffusivity in hierarchical nanoporous materials is primarily controlled by the sizes of the micropores and the connecting windows, particularly at relatively low loadings.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGibbs free energy 3acoordination compounds 3adiffusivity 3ahexane 3amicropores 3ananopores 3atemperature 3azeolites1 aSnurr, Randall Q.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2925-92460 tLangmuir.g2020 Jan. 19, v. 36, no. 5 p.1372-1378dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19170x1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.9b038023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03581naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245013000169520211000299592002802409650001802437650001802455650001602473650001602489650001202505650001302517650001502530650001302545650001002558650001602568650001402584650001602598650001202614650001402626650001502640653002102655653001702676653001802693653001402711653001802725653002402743653002802767700001702795700002902812700001702841773012502858856008302983852000903066655001203075IND60770057620221120222408.0220509e20220701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077005762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agee.2022.1079512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEeraerts, Maxime10aNesting material, phenology and landscape complexity influence nesting success and parasite infestation of a trap nesting bee  aSolitary bees are receiving increasing attention as they are very effective crop pollinators. However, widespread implementation of pollination management with solitary bees is hampered by a lack of targeted and practical guidelines. Indeed, little evidence-based guidelines exist about the preferred type of nesting material, how to control nest-associated macroparasites and how to promote a healthy offspring with sufficient female bees. This study investigated whether different types of artificial nesting materials – paper straws and wooden grooved boards – are preferred by the European orchard bee (Osmia cornuta). In addition, we explored how the bee nesting success and infestation of macroparasites are influenced by type of nesting material, landscape complexity and timing throughout the active nesting period of O. cornuta. We found that O. cornuta preferred to nest in paper straws compared to wooden grooved boards. The number of produced brood cells and the offspring sex-ratio (i.e. the ratio of female:male bees) were higher in wooden grooved boards. Number of brood cells, successful cocoon development and the sex-ratio all decreased throughout the nest-construction period of the bees. The sex-ratio also increased with increasing landscape complexity. Paper straws had a reduced infestation rate of kleptoparasitic mites. In addition, the infestation rate of both kleptoparasitic mites and kleptoparasitic drosophilid flies increased with time throughout the bees' nest-construction period. These findings present relevant evidence to aid successful implementation of solitary bees for crop pollination. Utilization of paper straws, or similar materials, over wooden grooved boards and closing the nests near the end of the bees’ active nest-construction period should be recommended practices. Implementation of these practices will reduce parasite infestation and enhance bee nesting success. Furthermore, conservation of semi-natural habitat or planting pollinator-friendly vegetation around fields is also advised to promote the proportion of female bees in the offspring.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDrosophilidae 3aOsmia cornuta 3aagriculture 3aenvironment 3afemales 3ahabitats 3alandscapes 3aorchards 3apaper 3aparasitoses 3aphenology 3apollination 3aprogeny 3asex ratio 3avegetation 0aCrop pollination 0aSolitary bee 0aOsmia cornuta 0aSex-ratio 0aMacroparasite 0aLandscape structure 0aSustainable agriculture1 aClymans, Rik1 aKerckvoorde, Vincent Van1 aBeliën, Tim0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2022 July 01, v. 332 p.107951-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34709x0167-88097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2022.1079513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03299naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003700092040001800129100001500147245015200162300001600314520175800330592002802088650001302116650001902129650001302148650002302161650001502184650002402199650002502223650000902248650001602257650001002273650001902283650002202302650002602324650002002350650001502370650002302385650002402408650001702432650001802449651001002467700001502477700001602492700001802508700002002526700001802546700002302564773009002587856008302677852000902760655001202769IND4472891920221117161422.0141112e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447289192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.still.2012.05.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Bin10aSoil microbial community dynamics over a maize (Zea mays L.) growing season under conventional- and no-tillage practices in a rainfed agroecosystem  ap. 153-160.  aTillage practices affect soil microorganisms, which in turn influence many processes essential to the function and sustainability of soil. In this study, the changes in soil microbial biomass and community composition in response to conventional tillage (CT, moldboard plowing and post-harvest residue removal) and no-tillage (NT) practices were examined during a maize (Zea mays L.) growing season in a clay loam soil (Typic Hapludoll) in northeastern China. Soil samples were taken in May, June, July, August, and September of 2008 at 0â5, 5â10, and 10â20cm depths. Microbial communities were characterized by phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis. While microbial biomass increased at the beginning then decreased toward the end of the growing season in CT soils, it showed the opposite trend in NT soils. Microbial community structure showed better distinction among sampling months than between tillage practices. These results suggest that seasonal variations in soil microbial communities could be greater than changes associated with tillage treatments. However, microbial biomass accumulation was tillage dependent. On average, NT treatment resulted in 21% higher microbial biomass in 0â5cm depth than CT treatment (P<0.05). Higher fungi to bacteria ratio was also observed under NT than CT treatment at both the 0â5 and 5â10cm sampling depths. These data demonstrate that examining the effect of management practices on soil quality based on soil microbial communities should consider seasonal changes in the environmental properties. It is strongly recommended that NT practice should be adopted as an effective component of an overall strategy to improve soil quality and sustainability in northeastern China.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZea mays 3aagroecosystems 3abacteria 3abiomass production 3aclay soils 3acommunity structure 3aconventional tillage 3acorn 3afatty acids 3afungi 3agrowing season 3amicrobial biomass 3amicrobial communities 3amoldboard plows 3ano-tillage 3aseasonal variation 3asoil microorganisms 3asoil quality 3asoil sampling 3aChina1 aHe, Hongbo1 aDing, Xueli1 aZhang, Xudong1 aZhang, Xiaoping1 aYang, Xueming1 aFilley, Timothy R.0 tSoil & tillage research.g2012 Aug., v. 124 p.153-160dElsevier B.V.x0167-19877nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.still.2012.05.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03976naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245010100172300001600273520171200289592002802001650001902029650002402048650001702072650002002089650002302109650002602132650001802158650001802176650001502194650001802209650002002227650002002247651001102267653002302278653002502301653002902326653002302355653002102378700002202399700001702421700005902438700002002497700001702517700002202534700001902556700003102575700002302606700001902629700002102648700005902669700001902728700002202747700001502769700002302784700002002807700005802827700005802885700002402943700005902967700005903026773009903085856008503184852000903269655001203278IND60635278420221120114307.0190416e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063527842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoser.2017.12.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnzaldua, Gerardo10aGetting into the water with the Ecosystem Services Approach: The DESSIN ESS evaluation framework  ap. 318-326.  aDriven by Europe’s pressing need to overcome its water quality and water scarcity challenges, the speed of innovation in the water sector is outpacing that of science. The methodologies available to assess the impact of innovative solutions to water-related challenges remain limited and highly theoretical, which sets boundaries on their application and usefulness to water practitioners. This hampers the uptake of new technologies and innovative management practices, thus foregoing potential gains in resource efficiency and nature protection, as well as wider benefits to society and the economy. To address this gap, the DESSIN project developed a framework to evaluate the changes in ecosystem services (ESS) associated with technical or management solutions implemented at the water body, sub-catchment or catchment level. The framework was developed with a specific focus on freshwater ecosystems to allow for a more detailed exploration of practical implementation issues. Its development, testing and validation was carried out by conducting ESS evaluations in three different urban case study settings. The framework builds upon existing classification systems for ESS (CICES and FEGS-CS) and incorporates the DPSIR adaptive management scheme as its main structural element. This enables compatibility with other international initiatives on ESS assessments and establishes a direct link to the EU Water Framework Directive, respectively. This work furthers research on practical implementation of the Ecosystem Services Approach, while pushing the discussion on how to promote more informed decision-making and support innovation uptake to address Europe’s current water-related challenges.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3aadaptive management 3acase studies 3adecision making 3aecosystem services 3afreshwater ecosystems 3asubwatersheds 3asurface water 3atechnology 3awater quality 3awater shortages 3awater utilities 3aEurope 0aEcosystem services 0aAssessment framework 0aPractical implementation 0aEconomic valuation 0aWater management1 aGerner, Nadine V.1 aLago, Manuel1 aAbhold, Katrina1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7072-04551 aHinzmann, Mandy1 aBeyer, Sarah1 aWinking, Caroline1 aRiegels, Niels1 aKrogsgaard Jensen, Jørgen1 aTermes, Montserrat1 aAmorós, Jaume1 aWencki, Kristina1 aStrehl, Clemens1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8126-36351 aUgarelli, Rita1 aHasenheit, Marius1 aNafo, Issa1 aHernández, Marta,1 aVilanova, Ester1 aDamman, Sigrid1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5290-93771 aBrouwer, Stijn1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0328-841X1 aRouillard, Josselin1 aSchwesig, David1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8694-56241 aBirk, Sebastian1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1441-29300 tEcosystem services.g2018 Apr., v. 30 p.318-326dElsevier B.V.wJournal:21609x2212-04167nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoser.2017.12.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03233naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245015100157300001600308520142900324592002801753596010801781650002501889650002001914650001101934650003001945650003101975650001002006650001102016650001702027650001402044650002102058650002702079650002502106650002402131650001202155650002902167650002002196653001702216653002002233653001802253653001502271653001802286700001502304700001502319700001802334700001702352700001402369700005702383700001702440773012702457856007402584852000902658655001202667IND60673754120221118111805.0191019e20190401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067375412DNAL7 a10.1093/pcp/pcy2522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYuan, Shuzhi10aTranscriptomic and Metabolic Profiling Reveals ‘Green Ring’ and ‘Red Ring’ on Jujube Fruit upon Postharvest Alternaria alternata Infection  ap. 844-861.  aAlternaria alternata is the major threat to postharvest storage of jujube (Ziziphus jujuba Mill.) fruit. We found that natural A. alternata infection can cause very typical phenotype of ‘green ring’ and ‘red ring’ surrounding the disease spot on the jujube fruit. The phenotype was successfully modeled and constructed on jujubes by artificial inoculation with the pathogen. Furthermore, the pathogenic infection is evidenced essential to the onset of the phenotype. The ‘red ring’ circle is proved to be pre-fixed to block the ‘green ring’ area as a battlefield combating the pathogen’s attack. We monitored the global transcriptomic profiling of ‘green ring’ and ‘red ring’ tissues from jujubes infected with A. alternata, in comparison with the mock-inoculated fruit and the control intact fruit. Large amount of differentially expressed genes were obtained in ‘green ring’, followed by ‘red ring’. Transcriptional alterations associated with the core and peripheral phenylpropanoid and lignin pathways, plant hormonal metabolisms were greatly influenced in the ‘green ring’ and ‘red ring’ by the A. alternata infection. The integrated analysis of transcriptomic profiling and metabolic changes revealed the differentially but delicately coordinated activation of these biological processes in the ‘green ring’ and ‘red ring’ on jujubes in defensing the fungal infection.  aPublisher supplied data  a31371846a31872907cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809 3aAlternaria alternata 3aZiziphus jujuba 3afruits 3afungal diseases of plants 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3alignin 3ametabolomics 3aphenotype 3aphenylpropanoids 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3apostharvest diseases 3apostharvest storage 3atissues 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscriptomics 0aJujube fruit 0aPhenylpropanoid 0aPlant hormone 0aResistance 0aTranscriptome1 aYan, Jiaqi1 aWang, Meng1 aDing, Xinyuan1 aZhang, Yinan1 aLi, Wusun1 aCao, Jiankang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6171-11701 aJiang, Weibo0 tPlant & cell physiology.g2019 Apr. 01, v. 60, no. 4 p.844-861dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl50549x1471-90537nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/pcp/pcy2523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03057naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245014400157300001800301500002000319520166200339592002802001596005702029650001702086650001102103650001002114650001102124650001502135650001402150650003002164650001202194650001002206651000902216700005602225700006002281700002902341700005702370773013602427856007502563852000902638655001202647IND60776379720221118054825.0220505e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077637972DNAL7 a10.1111/tbed.140782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalehi, Roya10aGenetic characterization of Blastocystis from poultry, livestock animals and humans in the southwest region of Iran—Zoonotic implications  ap. 1178-1185.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBlastocystis is the most common intestinal parasite found in epidemiological studies in Iran. The genus Blastocystis comprises multiple subtypes (ST), evincing the existence of extensive intrageneric diversity. Meanwhile, information on Blastocystis STs in domestic animals in Iran is limited. This study was designed to identify the prevalence and subtype distribution of Blastocystis in domestic animals and to evaluate the extent of zoonotic origin of human Blastocystis carriage. A total of 395 faecal samples from farm animals (220 from poultry, 100 from sheep and 75 from cattle) and 23 Blastocystis positive samples from humans (available from the previous report of this study and included for reference) from the Khuzestan province, southwestern Iran, were analysed. Standard parasitological methods and PCR‐based analysis of the SSU‐rRNA gene were used. Overall, 115 (29.1%; 95% CI, 26.5%–31.6%) of the animals were positive for Blastocystis sp. by parasitological methods. The highest colonization rate was found in cattle (50.6%, 38/75), followed by sheep (32.0%, 32/100) and poultry (20.4%, 45/220). Eight Blastocystis STs were identified among 55 sequenced isolates from animals (n = 32) and humans (n = 23): ST3 (27.3%), ST14 (25.4%), ST1 (12.7%), ST7 (12.7%), ST2 (9.1%), ST6 (7.3%), ST5 (3.6%) and ST10 (1.8%). Blastocystis ST1 and ST3 were found in both human and non‐human hosts, and examples of shared alleles (strains) were observed. Meanwhile, ST2 was observed only in humans, ST5 only in sheep, ST6 only in poultry and ST10 in only cattle. This is the most comprehensive report of Blastocystis STs in farm animals in Iran.  aPublisher supplied data  a6443cShahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences 3aBlastocystis 3acattle 3afarms 3ahumans 3aintestines 3aparasites 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apoultry 3asheep 3aIran1 aRostami, Ali1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1358-13211 aMirjalali, Hamed1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2568-90221 aStensvold, Christen Rune1 aHaghighi, Ali1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9227-42730 tTransboundary and emerging diseases.g2022 May, v. 69, no. 3 p.1178-1185dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl58702x1865-16747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/tbed.140783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02910naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245010400167300001600271520154700287592002801834650003301862650001801895650001401913650002001927650001101947650001901958650002001977650000901997650001102006650001402017650003602031700002202067700001602089700001902105700001902124700002202143700001702165700001802182700005702200773011502257856008302372852000902455655001202464IND60630594520221120040637.0190213e20190102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063059452DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.biochem.8b011752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKlug, Yoel A.14aThe HIV gp41 Fusion Protein Inhibits T-Cell Activation through the Lentiviral Lytic Peptide 2 Motif  ap. 818-832.  aThe human immunodeficiency virus enters its host cells by membrane fusion, initiated by the gp41 subunit of its envelope protein. gp41 has also been shown to bind T-cell receptor (TCR) complex components, interfering with TCR signaling leading to reduced T-cell activation. This immunoinhibitory activity is suggested to occur during the membrane fusion process and is attributed to various membranotropic regions of the gp41 ectodomain and to the transmembrane domain. Although extensively studied, the cytosolic region of gp41, termed the cytoplasmic tail (CT), has not been examined in the context of immune suppression. Here we investigated whether the CT inhibits T-cell activation in different T-cell models by utilizing gp41-derived peptides and expressed full gp41 proteins. We found that a conserved region of the CT, termed lentiviral lytic peptide 2 (LLP2), specifically inhibits the activation of mouse, Jurkat, and human primary T-cells. This inhibition resulted in reduced T-cell proliferation, gene expression, cytokine secretion, and cell surface expression of CD69. Differential activation of the TCR signaling cascade revealed that CT-based immune suppression occurs downstream of the TCR complex. Moreover, LLP2 peptide treatment of Jurkat and primary human T-cells impaired Akt but not NFκB and ERK1/2 activation, suggesting that immune suppression occurs through the Akt pathway. These findings identify a novel gp41 T-cell suppressive element with a unique inhibitory mechanism that can take place post-membrane fusion.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHuman immunodeficiency virus 3aT-lymphocytes 3acytokines 3agene expression 3ahumans 3alytic peptides 3amembrane fusion 3amice 3amodels 3asecretion 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B1 aSchwarzer, Roland1 aRotem, Etai1 aCharni, Meital1 aNudelman, Alon1 aGramatica, Andrea1 aZarmi, Batya1 aRotter, Varda1 aShai, Yechiel1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4151-55130 tBiochemistry.g2019 Jan. 02, v. 58, no. 6 p.818-832dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19162x1520-49957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.8b011753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02253naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245014100162300001800303520103000321592002801351650001501379650002001394650002001414650000901434650002401443650001301467650001401480650001901494650001101513650001601524650002501540650000901565651001001574700001701584700001701601700001801618773011701636856008101753852000901834655001201843IND60440633520221119181028.0151024e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044063352DNAL7 a10.1007/s12665-015-4447-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Chao10aQuantifying the parameters that control turbulent land–atmosphere energy exchange over the Dunhuang Gobi land surface, northwest China  ap. 4745-4750.  aLand–atmosphere interactions in the northwest arid and semi-arid areas of China are important because of their influence on energy exchange at both regional and global scales. In this paper, regular meteorological observations, as well as flux eddy covariance methods, are used to measure land–atmosphere energy exchange. Experiments were conducted over the Dunhuang Gobi, a typical arid region of northwest China, during the summer of 2008. Surface fluxes were measured directly using an eddy-correlation system, while the vertical gradients of wind and temperature were also observed at four levels using a meteorological tower. Based on the observation data, the integral mean of surface albedo over the Gobi was found to be 0.238. In addition, the mean values of momentum, heat roughness lengths, and soil thermal conductivity were, 0.045, 0.005 cm, 0.199 and 0.201 W (m K)⁻¹, respectively. The Monin–Obukhov similarity functions for momentum and heat were analyzed and new empirical formulae were developed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarid zones 3aeddy covariance 3aenergy transfer 3aheat 3ameteorological data 3amomentum 3aroughness 3asemiarid zones 3asummer 3atemperature 3athermal conductivity 3awind 3aChina1 aWei, Zhigang1 aLi, Zhenchao1 aXiao, Tiangui0 tEnvironmental earth sciences.g2015 Sept., v. 74, no. 6 p.4745-4750dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1866-62807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-015-4447-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01391naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001800143245008700161300001800248520025500266592002800521650001100549650002500560650001900585650001700604650001800621653002100639653001600660653001500676700001300691700002400704700001600728700001900744700001600763773015200779856007700931852000901008655001201017IND60522257320221121004251.0160602e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052225732DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-2004-09212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Shumin,10aTwo New Tirucallane Triterpenes with Six-Membered Hemiacetal from Amoora dasyclada  ap. 1067-1069.  aTwo novel tirucallane derivatives, 3α,21β ,25-triol-tirucalla-21,24-epoxy-23-one (1) and 21β ,25- diol-tirucalla-21,24-epoxy-3,23-dione (2), were isolated from Amoora dasyclada.

The protein content, peptide content, antioxidant activity and antibacterial activity were determined. The peptides were fractionated using size exclusion and the identified using LC-MS/MS in combination with PEAKS Studio software. The protein content for raw, boiled and fermented samples was 20, 15 and 13 g/100g DW and the peptide content was 0.3, 12.1 and 15.1 mg/g DW, respectively. Fermentation process increased the DPPH activity of bitter beans to 78.48 ± 3.16%. Fermentation process significantly increased the antibacterial activity of bitter beans towards Escherichia coli (45%), Salmonella Typhimurium (73%), Staphylococcus aureus (64%), and Listeria monocytogenes (57%). Out of the seven peptides identified in fraction 11, three peptides including EAKPSFYLK, PVNNNAWAYATNFVPGK and AIGIFVKPDTAV demonstrated antibacterial activity at different concentrations (1000, 500, 250 and 125 μg/mL). The DPPH activity was only observed for the peptides EAKPSFYLK (74%) and PVNNNAWAYATNFVPGK (87%). In conclusion, fermentation process increased the antioxidant and antibacterial activity of bitter beans due to the presence of low molecular weight peptides. The bioactive peptides are very promising ingredients to formulate functional foods and beverages.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aEscherichia coli 3aListeria monocytogenes 3aParkia speciosa 3aSalmonella Typhimurium 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aantibacterial properties 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3abeans 3abeverages 3aboiling 3acomputer software 3afermentation 3afractionation 3afunctional foods 3aingredients 3aliquid chromatography 3amolecular weight 3apeptides 3aprotein content 3atandem mass spectrometry 0aFermented bitter beans 0aBioactive peptides 0aFood process 0aFunctional ingredients1 aAbdul Rani, Nur Fatin1 aMeor Hussin, Anis Shobirin0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2020 Sept., v. 131 p.109776-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2020.1097763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02783naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245011500162500002000277520130200297592002801599596001901627596007601646650002401722650002101746650001501767650002501782650002001807650002401827650001601851650002301867650002401890650002201914650001901936650003101955700002201986700002502008700002702033700002202060700002002082700002602102773011402128856007402242852000902316655001202325IND60791238220221120164644.0220826e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079123822DNAL7 a10.1002/aws2.11282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKempisty, David M.10aGranular activated carbon adsorption of carcinogenic volatile organic compounds at low influent concentrations  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe effectiveness of granular activated carbon (GAC) for carcinogenic volatile organic compounds (cVOCs) has not been evaluated in the low‐ to submicrogram per liter range. Rapid small‐scale column tests were used to determine the GAC performance at empty bed contact times (EBCTs) of 7.5 and 15 min for 13 cVOCs at a target influent concentration of 5 μg/L in a typical groundwater matrix. Breakthrough was assessed for vinyl chloride, dichloromethane, 1,1‐dichloroethane (1,1 DCA), 1,2‐dichloroethane (1,2 DCA), 1,2‐dichloropropane, carbon tetrachloride, 1,3‐butadiene, 1,1,1,2‐tetrachloroethane, 1,2,3‐trichloropropane, trichloroethylene, and tetrachloroethylene. The throughput to breakthrough was found to be linearly correlated to capacities calculated with single‐solute equilibrium isotherm parameters. Modest decreases, 9–13% on average, in throughput to 50 and 75% breakthrough were found when the EBCT was increased from 7.5 to 15 min. The carbon use rate (CUR), when scaled to simulate full‐scale adsorption, indicated that GAC would be a viable technology for seven of the cVOCs evaluated, with a CUR threshold of less than 0.2 lb/1,000 gal. It may be possible to use 1,1 DCA and 1,2 DCA as surrogates for assessing chemicals near the feasibility limit.  aPublisher supplied data  cU.S. Air Force  cU.S. Environmental Protection Agency Office of Research and Development 3a1,2-dichloropropane 3aactivated carbon 3aadsorption 3acarbon tetrachloride 3acarcinogenicity 3aethylene dichloride 3agroundwater 3amethylene chloride 3atetrachloroethylene 3atrichloroethylene 3avinyl chloride 3avolatile organic compounds1 aSummers, R.

This study was aimed to determine whether autophagic signaling is involved in the therapeutic effect of UDCA on liver fibrosis.By using hepatic stellate cell (HSC) line LX2 and CCl₄-induced fibrotic rat model, autophagy signaling was investigated by western blotting and mRFP-EGFP-LC3 tandem fluorescent tagged plasmid (ptfLC3) transfection technique. Anti-fibrotic profile was determined by western blotting, qRT-PCR, MTT assay, trypan blue, hydroxyproline assay and Masson staining.TGFβ1 treatment decreased P62 accumulation and increased both autophagosomes and autolysosomes in LX2 cells, thereby elevated autophagic flux. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), antagonist of autophagy, was found to dramatically inhibit COL1A2 mRNA expression and cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. This coincides with the effect of UDCA intervention on collagen aggradation and cell viability. Meanwhile, UDCA inhibited TGFβ1-induced autophagy flux. And rapamycin, agonist of autophagy, was found to impair the anti-fibrotic effect of UDCA. Moreover, study in vivo showed that UDCA alone or in combination with HCQ restored the CCl₄-induced liver fibrosis in rodent models with autophagy inhibited profile.Taken together, our study revealed that UDCA displays anti-fibrotic role by protecting HSC against production of collagen and inhibiting cellular viability involving autophagy inhibition and provide a new insight into the pharmacological basis of UDCA treatment for hepatic fibrosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern blotting 3aagonists 3aanimal models 3aantagonists 3aautophagy 3acell proliferation 3acell viability 3acollagen 3adose response 3afluorescence 3agene expression 3ahydroxyproline 3aliver 3aliver cirrhosis 3amessenger RNA 3aplasmids 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arapamycin 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3atherapeutics 3atoxicity testing 3atransfection 3aursodeoxycholic acid 0aLiver fibrosis 0aUrsodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) 0aHepatic stellate cells (HSC)1 aZhang, Ji-Wang1 aChen, Xing-Zhou1 aWu, Peng-Bo1 aChen, Li1 aZhang, Guo0 tLife sciences.g2020 Feb. 01, v. 242 p.117175-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11720x0024-32057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2019.1171753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01167naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001800138245009000156300001600246520024900262592002800511650002300539650002300562650002300585650001300608700002400621700002600645773012500671856007200796852000900868655001200877IND60657591820221121014428.0190816e20050106xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065759182DNAL7 a10.1039/b412221f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBhakta, Mehul10aEvidence for a hydrogen abstraction mechanism in P₄₅₀-catalyzed N-dealkylations  ap. 265-267.  aThe experimental evidence presented in this manuscript suggest against the widely accepted single electron/proton transfer mechanism for P₄₅₀ catalyzed N-dealkylations and provides strong support for a hydrogen atom abstraction mechanism.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalytic activity 3achemical compounds 3achemical reactions 3ahydrogen1 aHollenberg, Paul F.1 aWimalasena, Kandatege0 tChemical communications.g2005 Jan. 6, , no. 2 p.265-267dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b412221f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02504naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245011200168300001400280520124000294592002801534650001701562650002701579650001901606650001101625650002501636650002501661650001301686650001501699650002801714650002201742651001001764653001901774653002201793653002301815653003401838700001901872773014301891856005102034852000902085655001202094IND50088100420221119084243.0140412e20110211xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008810042DNAL7 a10.1080/13504509.2010.5274592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Guiming10aIntegrating eco-efficiency and eco-effectiveness into the design of sustainable industrial systems in China  ap. 65-77.  aAs an important tool for environment management, eco-efficiency has been widely applied, but eco-effectiveness has only made progress on eco-design and life cycle management in recent years. Few have attempted to integrate eco-efficiency and eco-effectiveness into sustainable industrial systems. In a new framework integrating eco-efficiency and eco-effectiveness, both concepts can find unique roles and complement each other in industrial ecosystems to dissolve conflicts between industry and the environment. This article provides a case study of China in which eco-efficiency indicators (energy, water and waste utilisation intensity) have demonstrated great progress in China, but eco-efficiency cannot stop the increasing release of pollutants and their accumulating impact on ecological life-support systems. China must integrate eco-effectiveness and eco-efficiency into concrete sustainable development strategies, questioning whether limited resources are being used correctly. Both eco-efficiency and eco-effectiveness are identified as important indicators in the development of sustainable industrial systems. In the framework of sustainable industrial systems, eco-effectiveness must begin to play a more important role.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3adesign for environment 3aeco-efficiency 3aenergy 3aenvironmental impact 3aindustrial symbiosis 3aindustry 3apollutants 3asustainable development 3awaste utilization 3aChina 0aeco-efficiency 0aeco-effectiveness 0aindustrial ecology 0asustainable industrial system1 aCote, Raymond,0 tinternational journal of sustainable development and world ecology.g2011 Feb. 11, v. 18, no. 1 p.65-77dTaylor & Francisx1745-26277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13504509.2010.527459  aDNAL 7aarticle03058naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245011800169300001400287520174400301592002802045650001802073650002002091650001202111650001202123650001802135650001502153650001502168650002002183650001502203650001202218650001002230651001302240653003302253653001402286653001702300653001002317653001102327653001702338700002202355700002002377773014302397856005102540852000902591655001202600IND50088100520221119084210.0140412e20110211xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008810052DNAL7 a10.1080/13504509.2010.5301242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYami, Mastewal10aInformal institutions as mechanisms to address challenges in communal grazing land management in Tigray, Ethiopia  ap. 78-87.  aThe role of institutions providing rules, norms and regulations, in addressing challenges in communal resources management has been debated for several decades. This article analyses the role of informal institutions for addressing shortage of grazing land, conflicts among users of communal grazing land and resistance among users to shift from free grazing to zero grazing in Tigray, Ethiopia. We used in depth interviews and focus group discussions for data collection. We argue that informal institutions are important mechanisms for addressing the challenges in communal grazing land management. The contributions of informal institutions for addressing challenges in communal grazing lands varied with type of challenge and were influenced by distances from markets and Wereda towns. Although the informal institutions were crucial in reversing the shortage of grazing land by regulating access to communal grazing land and enhancing controlled use of grass, they did not contribute to resolving conflicts that arose from unequal allocation of benefits in the village far from a market and Wereda town. Incorporating zero-grazing practices in informal institutions was hindered by disagreements among users and the top-down approach used by development agents when introducing zero grazing. To enhance effectiveness of informal institutions, the increasing grazing pressure should be addressed using more efficient schemes for harvesting grass. Moreover, creating awareness of the need for fewer but more productive cattle breeds is crucial. Consideration of well-performing informal institutions in policy and development interventions is essential to maximise the benefits of communal grazing lands to improve livelihoods of users.  aPublisher supplied data 3acattle breeds 3adata collection 3agrasses 3agrazing 3agrazing lands 3aharvesting 3ainterviews 3aland management 3alivelihood 3amarkets 3atowns 3aEthiopia 0acommunal resource management 0aconflicts 0afree grazing 0arules 0aWereda 0azero grazing1 aVögl, Christian,1 aHauser, Michael0 tinternational journal of sustainable development and world ecology.g2011 Feb. 11, v. 18, no. 1 p.78-87dTaylor & Francisx1745-26277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13504509.2010.530124  aDNAL 7aarticle01216naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002400138245006700162300001600229520019100245592002800436650002600464650002300490650001700513650001500530650001300545700002300558700002700581700002300608700002100631700001900652773012500671856007300796852000900869655001200878IND60657592020221121085711.0190816e20050208xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065759202DNAL7 a10.1039/b412251h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAntesberger, Jochen10aSolvent-free, direct synthesis of supramolecular nano-capsules  ap. 892-894.  aThe single step direct synthesis of pyrogallol[4]arene via a solvent free protocol yields the pure product as a self-assembled nano-capsule, comprised of six macrocyclic building blocks.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaromatic hydrocarbons 3achemical reactions 3ananocapsules 3apyrogallol 3asolvents1 aCave, Gareth W.

Extensive genetic and molecular analyses have shown that these proteins act as master regulators of flower development, and function not only in organ identity determination but also during organ morphogenesis. Although it is now well established that these transcription factors act in higher order protein complexes in the regulation of transcription, the gene expression programmes controlled by them have remained largely elusive. Only recently, detailed insights into their functions have been obtained through the combination of a wide range of experimental methods, including transcriptomic and proteomic approaches. Here, we review the progress that has been made in the characterization of the floral organ identity factors from the main model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, and we discuss what is known about the processes acting downstream of these regulators. We further outline open questions, which we believe need to be addressed to obtain a more complete view of the molecular processes that govern floral organ development and specification.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3aflowering 3agenes 2aArabidopsisxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aFlowersxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Developmental 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGene Regulatory Networks 2aMutation 2aTranscription Factorsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 0aArabidopsis 0afloral organ identity factors 0aflower development 0ahomeotic mutants1 aGraciet, Emmanuelle1 aRiechmann, José Luis,0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2014 Jan., v. 65, no. 1 p.1-9dOxford University Press [etc.]wJournal:jnl44658x0022-09577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/ert3853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03308naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100004000150245016300190300001400353520180700367592002802174650001202202650001202214650001802226650001502244650002202259650001902281650003102300650001202331650001302343650001902356650001502375650001102390650001802401650001002419650001302429651001502442653001802457653001702475653001902492653001902511653001502530700001702545700002002562700001702582773014302599856005102742852000902793655001202802IND50088100620221119084206.0140412e20110211xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008810062DNAL7 a10.1080/13504509.2010.5329062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChowdhury, Mohammad Shaheed Hossain10aBiomass fuel use, burning technique and reasons for the denial of improved cooking stoves by Forest User Groups of Rema-Kalenga Wildlife Sanctuary, Bangladesh  ap. 88-97.  aUse of biomass fuel in traditional cooking stoves (TCS) is a long-established practice that has incomplete combustion and generates substances with global warming potential (GWP). Improved cooking stoves (ICS) have been developed worldwide as an alternative household fuel burning device, as well as a climate change mitigation. A study was conducted among female Forest User Groups (FUGs) of Rema-Kalenga Wildlife Sanctuary, Bangladesh, to assess the status of ICS disseminated by the Forest Department (FD) under the Nishorgo (2009) Support Project, along with the community's biomass fuel consumption pattern. Wood consumption was highest (345 kg month⁻¹ household⁻¹) followed by agricultural residues (60 kg month⁻¹ household⁻¹), tree leaves (51 kg month⁻¹ household⁻¹) and cow dung (25 kg month⁻¹ household⁻¹). Neighbouring forests of the sanctuary was the core source for wood fuel, with little or no reduction in the extraction even after joining the FUG. Twenty-two species, both indigenous and introduced, were preferred as wood fuel. None of the respondents were found willing to use ICS although 43% owned one; either as a status symbol or to meet the conditions of the FD for membership in FUG. Seven negative features of the disseminated ICS were identified by households, which made them unwilling to use them further. Manufacturing faults may be responsible for some ICS demerits, while the FD failed to convince the community of the benefits. A proper examination of the disseminated ICS efficacy is crucial, with active involvement of community members. The Sustainable Energy Triangle Strategy (SETS) could be implemented for this purpose. Findings of the study are of immense importance in designing a strategy for the introduction of ICS into Bangladesh.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3aburning 3acattle manure 3acombustion 3acommunity service 3acooking stoves 3aenergy use and consumption 3aforests 3afuelwood 3aglobal warming 3ahouseholds 3aleaves 3amanufacturing 3atrees 3awildlife 3aBangladesh 0acooking stove 0abiomass fuel 0aclimate change 0aprotected area 0aBangladesh1 aKoike, Masao1 aAkther, Shalina1 aMiah, Danesh0 tinternational journal of sustainable development and world ecology.g2011 Feb. 11, v. 18, no. 1 p.88-97dTaylor & Francisx1745-26277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13504509.2010.532906  aDNAL 7aarticle03413naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245013300163300001800296520151900314592002801833650002301861650001201884650001901896650002001915650001901935650001501954650002101969650002601990650002502016650003602041650002602077650001702103650002202120650001802142650002102160650001102181650001602192650001702208650002302225650001102248650001902259650002002278650001402298650001902312650001402331650002802345700002602373700001902399700002002418700002502438700001902463700001902482700001902501700003002520700001802550773012402568856007402692852000902766655001202775IND60639967220221119054604.0190503e20170816xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063996722DNAL7 a10.1039/c7fo00731k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChahdoura, Hassiba10aBioactivity and chemical characterization of Opuntia macrorhiza Engelm. seed oil: potential food and pharmaceutical applications  ap. 2739-2747.  aIn the food industry, there is a continuous search for ingredients that might provide advantageous properties to food products, either considering their nutritional value or bioactivity, as well as flavouring and technological aspects. Crude oils are good examples of this type of ingredient, especially if obtained from nonconventional sources. Accordingly, the Opuntia macrorhiza Engelm. seed oil (OMSO) was chemically characterized and evaluated for different in vitro and in vivo bioactivities. OMSO presented physicochemical characteristics appropriate to be considered as an edible oil, namely low acidity value, stability to oxidation (high peroxide value and low K₂₃₂ and K₂₇₀ values), and high contents of unsaturated fatty acids (as shown by the iodine value) and saponifiable matter. Furthermore, this natural oil, owing to its rich phytochemical profile, showed relevant antioxidant activity (especially in lipid peroxidation inhibition assays), α-glucosidase inhibitory activity, cytotoxicity against human tumour cell lines, antibacterial (mainly against Gram positive species) and antifungal properties, as well as anti-inflammatory and analgesic activities. Furthermore, OMSO did not show any sign of acute toxicity on animals, highlighting its possible use in different applications, considering that this natural product is not expected to induce the adverse effects typically associated with synthetic bioactive agents (e.g., ampicillin, amphotericin B, or lysine acetylsalicilate).  aPublisher supplied data 3aOpuntia macrorhiza 3aacidity 3aacute toxicity 3aadverse effects 3aamphotericin B 3aampicillin 3aanalgesic effect 3aantifungal properties 3aantioxidant activity 3achemical constituents of plants 3acooking fats and oils 3acytotoxicity 3aenzyme inhibition 3afood industry 3ahuman cell lines 3ahumans 3aingredients 3aiodine value 3alipid peroxidation 3alysine 3aneoplasm cells 3anutritive value 3aoxidation 3aperoxide value 3aseed oils 3aunsaturated fatty acids1 aBarreira, João C.

Deforestation may alter the natural circulation of viruses and change the composition, abundance, behaviour and possibly viral exposure of reservoir species. This in turn might increase contact between infected animals and humans. Fruit bats of the family Pteropodidae have been suspected as reservoirs of the Ebola virus. At present, the only evidence associating fruit bats with EVD is the presence of seropositive individuals in eight species and polymerase chain reaction‐positive individuals in three of these. Our study investigates whether human activities can increase African fruit bat geographical ranges and whether this influence overlaps geographically with EVD outbreaks that, in turn, are favoured by deforestation. We use species observation records for the 20 fruit bat species found in favourable areas for the Ebola virus to determine factors affecting the bats' range inside the predicted Ebola virus area. We do this by employing a hypothetico‐deductive approach based on favourability modelling. We show that the range of some fruit bat species is linked to human activities within the favourable areas for the Ebola virus. More specifically, the areas where human activities favour the presence of five fruit bat species overlap with the areas where EVD outbreaks in humans were themselves favoured by deforestation. These five species are as follows: Eidolon helvum, Epomops franqueti, Megaloglossus woermanni, Micropteropus pusillus and Rousettus aegyptiacus. Of these five, all but Megaloglossus woermanni have recorded seropositive individuals. For the remaining 15 bat species, we found no biogeographical support for the hypothesis that positive human influence on fruit bats could be associated with EVD outbreaks in deforested areas within the tropical forest biome in West and Central Africa. Our work is a useful first step allowing further investigation of the networks and pathways that may lead to an EVD outbreak. The modelling framework we employ here can be used for other emerging infectious diseases.  aPublisher supplied data  cUSAID as part of the Bushmeat Research Initiative of the CGIAR Research Program on Forests, Trees and Agroforestry  aCGL2016‐76747‐RcSpanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness  cFEDER Funds 3aEbolavirus 3aRousettus 3adeforestation 3adisease outbreaks 3aecosystems 3aemerging diseases 3aenzymes 3ageographical distribution 3ahumans 3amodels 3aseroprevalence 3atropical forests 3aviruses 3aCentral Africa1 aFa, John E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3611-84871 aFarfán, Miguel Á.1 aMárquez, Ana L.1 aReal, Raimundo1 aJuste, F.

Airflow varies in space and time in the vicinity of rivers. Consequently, there is limited utility in point measurements. Ground-based remote sensing offers the opportunity to study 3D airflow in locations which are difficult to observe with conventional approaches. For three months in the winter and spring of 2011, the airflow above the River Thames in central London was observed using a scanning Doppler lidar, a scintillometer and sonic anemometers. First, an inter-comparison showed that lidar-derived mean wind-speed estimates compare almost as well to sonic anemometers (root-mean-square error (rmse) 0.65–0.68ms−1) as comparisons between sonic anemometers (0.35–0.73ms−1). Second, the lidar duo-beam operating strategy provided horizontal transects of wind vectors (comparison with scintillometer rmse 1.12–1.63ms−1) which revealed mean and turbulent airflow across the river and surrounds; in particular, channelled airflow along the river and changes in turbulence quantities consistent with the roughness changes between built and river environments. The results have important consequences for air quality and dispersion around urban rivers, especially given that many cities have high traffic rates on roads located on riverbanks.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair quality 3aturbulent flow 3aanemometers 3adispersions 3arivers 3awind 3awinter 3alidar 3aroads 3aroughness 3aspace and time 3aspring 3amethodology 3aremote sensing 3acities 3aair flow 3atraffic 2aAirxstandards 2aArchitecture as Topic 2aDoppler Effect 2aEnvironmental Monitoringxinstrumentationxmethods. 2aGeography 2aModels, Theoretical 2aRivers 2aSound 2aUrbanization 2aWind 0aLondon 0aInstrument comparison 0aKSS 0aKCL 0aKSK 0aMicro-meteorology 0aUrban climate 0aKWJ 0aSonic anemometry 0aBLS 0aRoughness sub-layer 0aCSAT3 0aScanning Doppler lidar 0anew methods1 aPauscher, L.1 aWard, H.C.1 aKotthaus, S.1 aBarlow, J.F.1 aGouvea, M.1 aLane, S.E.1 aGrimmond, C.S.B.0 tScience of the total environment.g2013 Jan. 01, v. 442 p.527-533dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2012.10.0613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02050naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245007500161300001800236520097900254592002801233650001001261650002401271650001501295650001301310650001901323650001401342650001401356650001901370650002201389700003001411700001901441700002001460773012501480856007401605852000901679655001201688IND60639967320221119054411.0190503e20171018xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063996732DNAL7 a10.1039/c7fo00739f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDebnath, Trishna10aRole of phytochemicals in the modulation of miRNA expression in cancer  ap. 3432-3442.  aMicroRNAs (miRNAs) are single-stranded non-coding endogenous RNAs linked with normal developmental and physiological processes. Recent studies have demonstrated that the dysregulation of miRNAs plays an important role in the beginning, progression, and metastasis of many cancers. Additionally, they are involved in the regulation of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in many cancer cells. Several studies have suggested that phytochemicals play an important role in the modulation of miRNA expression, which is related to changes in oncogenes, tumour suppressors, and cancer-related protein expression. Hence, phytonutrients can suppress tumour development, prevent metastasis, reverse the EMT, and improve drug sensitivity via the modulation of miRNA expression. In this review, we discuss tumour-suppressing and oncogenic miRNAs and the mechanism of action for miRNAs as well as the role of phytochemicals in the modulation of miRNAs in various cancer cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3adrugs 3amechanism of action 3ametastasis 3amicroRNA 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3aoncogenes 3aphytonutrients 3aprotein synthesis1 aDeb Nath, Narayan Chandra1 aKim, Eun-Kyung1 aLee, Kwang-Geun0 tFood & function.g2017 Oct. 18, v. 8, no. 10 p.3432-3442dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26907x2042-650X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7fo00739f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03668naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245013100166520165700297592002801954650001301982650003101995650001802026650002002044650001402064650002302078650001402101650001902115650002002134650003102154650001002185650001602195650000802211650001802219650001402237650001402251650001402265650001702279650001402296650002002310650001402330650005202344650001002396653003602406653002302442653002802465653001502493653002602508700001902534700001502553700001502568700001602583700001602599700001302615700001702628700001802645700002002663700001902683700001502702700001902717700001602736700001702752773009802769856008202867852000902949655001202958IND60679904920221122104737.0200117e20200201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067990492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lfs.2019.1172072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Shanshan10aTROVE2 strengthens the anti-inflammatory effect via macrophage polarization by estrogen induction in abdominal aortic aneurysm  aAbdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) is a severe cardiovascular disease, with high mortality rate after acute rupture of blood vessels. However, the underlying pathogenesis of different morbidity between men and women remains unclear. In the present study, we first selected four datasets including 68 AAA and 32 control samples from published data on GEO database, and analyzed them by data mining. The integrative analysis found a total of 368 differentially expressed genes in E2-related AAA. Next, regulatory mechanism networks among these target genes were predicted, and four genes were identified as key nodes in the network, which play a major role in the immune system. We focused on the role of monocytes/macrophages in the development of cardiovascular diseases to further explore the role of estrogen in the polarization of monocytes/macrophage, the mRNA level of the four genes was validated by RT-PCR in RAW264.7 cells treated with β-estradiol (E2), diarylpropionitrile (DPN), 1,3,5-Tris(4-hydroxyphenyl)-4-propyl-1H-pyrazole (PPT), fulvestrant or vehicle. The results showed that the mRNA level and protein level of TROVE2 was significantly increased in estrogen or estrogen receptor agonist-treated groups. Moreover, estrogen affected the transformation of macrophages to M2 phenotype by detecting M1- and M2-related indicator genes at the mRNA level. Flow cytometry demonstrated that the TROVE2 deficiency led to a notable decrease in the level of M2 phenotype marker protein CD206. In conclusion, our results suggest that E2 can promote the expression of TROVE2, which is closely related to the M2-phenotype transformation of macrophages.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaneurysm 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3ablood vessels 3adata collection 3adatabases 3aestrogen receptors 3aestrogens 3aflow cytometry 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3amacrophages 3amen 3amessenger RNA 3amonocytes 3amorbidity 3amortality 3apathogenesis 3aphenotype 3aprotein content 3apyrazoles 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3awomen 0aAbdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) 0aEstrogen signaling 0aGene expression omnibus 0aTOVE2 gene 0aMonocytes/macrophages1 aZhao, Yuanyuan1 aJin, Huang1 aQi, Xiaoyu1 aHe, Jinrong1 aHuang, Juan1 aDing, Yu1 aChen, Weiqun1 aWu, Chuangyan1 aDing, Xiangchao1 aChen, Shanshan1 aZhang, Hao1 aShang, Yuqiang1 aDu, Dunfeng1 aZhao, Jiajia0 tLife sciences.g2020 Feb. 01, v. 242 p.117207-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11720x0024-32057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2019.1172073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02622naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245009900159300001800258520107900276592002801355650002001383650002901403650002501432650001701457650002401474650001201498650001701510650001801527650001801545650001501563650001501578650004801593650001401641650002801655650002301683650001401706700002201720700002001742700002501762700002101787700002301808700002401831700002301855700003001878773012501908856007402033852000902107655001202116IND60639967420221119054630.0190503e20170920xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063996742DNAL7 a10.1039/c7fo00744b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRached, Wahiba10aDetailed phytochemical characterization and bioactive properties of Myrtus nivelii Batt & Trab  ap. 3111-3119.  aThe endemic Algerian myrtle, Myrtus nivelii Batt & Trab., was evaluated for its bioactive properties, such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, cytotoxic and antibacterial activities, and correlated with the individual phenolic compounds identified in its crude aqueous extract and subsequent organic fractions (ethyl acetate and butanol). Flavonols, such as myricetin, kaempferol and quercetin glycoside derivatives, were the major phenolic compounds found, along with the presence of ellagitannins. The ethyl acetate fraction contained the highest amount of phenolic compounds, followed by the butanol fraction and, finally, the crude aqueous extract. In general, all samples exhibited an excellent bioactivity, namely the ethyl acetate fraction that presented strong antioxidant activity, when compared to the standard trolox, strong cytotoxicity and antibacterial activity, especially against MRSA and MSSA.

Among the external causes, nutrition as well as physical activity appear to be potential drivers of microbial diversity, both at the taxonomic and functional level, likely also influencing endocrine system, and acting as endocrine organ itself. To date, clear-cut data regarding which microbial populations are modified, and by which mechanisms are lacking. Moreover, the relationship between the microbial shifts and the metabolic practical potential of the gut microbiota is still unclear. Further research by longitudinal and well-designed studies is needed to investigate whether microbiome manipulation may be an effective tool for improving human health and, also, performance in athletes, and whether these effects may be then extended to the overall health promotion of general populations. In this review, we evaluate and summarize the current knowledge regarding the interaction and cross-talks among hormonal modifications, physical performance, and microbiota content and function.  aPublisher supplied data 3aathletic performance 3aclearcutting 3aendocrine system 3ahealth promotion 3ahuman health 3aintestinal microorganisms 3amicrobial communities 3amicrobiome 3anutrition 3aphysical activity1 aBimonte, Viviana M.1 aSabato, Claudia 1 aPaoli, Antonio 1 aBaldari, Carlo 1 aCampanella, Matteo 1 aLenzi, Andrea 1 aFerretti, Elisabetta 1 aMigliaccio, Silvia 0 tFoods.g2021 Dec. 10, v. 10, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods101230753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01120naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002200138245007300160300001800233520014700251592002800398650002500426650002300451650001400474650001500488700002400503700002500527700002200552700002100574773012900595856007300724852000900797655001200806IND60657592420221122110903.0190816e20041112xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065759242DNAL7 a10.1039/b412300j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchwaebisch, Dirk10aBiomimetic synthesis of the pyrrolobenzoxazine core of paeciloxazine  ap. 2552-2553.  aStarting from a protected l-tryptophan derivative the pyrrolobenzoxazine core unit of paeciloxazine can be synthesized in two oxidation steps.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomimetic synthesis 3achemical compounds 3aoxidation 3atryptophan1 aTchabanenko, Kirill1 aAdlington, Robert M.1 aCowley, Andrew M.1 aBaldwin, Jack E.0 tChemical communications.g2004 Nov. 12, , no. 22 p.2552-2553dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b412300j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02229naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002400143245020500167300001400372520076600386592002801152650002201180650001101202650002201213650001301235650002101248650002601269650004401295650001301339650001501352650002201367650002001389653005601409653002601465653000801491653002701499700002301526700002401549773014801573856007701721852000901798655001201807IND60522258520221121004120.0160602e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052225852DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-2005-01112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGholivand, Khodayar10aCrystal Structure of and ab initio Calculations on [(C6H5)(CH3)CH-NH]- P(O)(p-OC6H4CH3)2, Syntheses and Spectroscopic Characterization of N-Benzyl Phosphoramidic Acid (4-Methylphenyl)ester Derivatives  ap. 67-74.  aSome new N-benzyl phosphoramidic acid (4-methylphenyl)ester derivatives were synthesized and characterized by ¹H, ¹³C, ³¹P NMR and IR spectroscopy and elemental analysis.

Comparative Behavior with Sunflower Oils and High-Oleic Sunflower Oils  aFrying performance of olive-pomace oils (OPOs) as compared to sunflower oils (SOs) and high-oleic sunflower oils (HOSOs) was studied in discontinuous frying (DF) and continuous frying (CF) for the first time. DF is used in household, restaurants and frying outlets, while CF is used in the food industry. Oil alteration during frying was determined by measurements of polar compounds (PC) and polymers. Fried potatoes were analyzed for oil absorption and alteration, color, and evaluated in an acceptability test. Results for DF showed that all SOs reached 25% PC at the 9th frying operation (FO), whereas HOSOs did between the 17–18th FO and variable results were found for OPOs since initial levels of diacylglycerols were different. Rates of formation of PC or polymers were the lowest for OPOs, thus showing the best performance in DF. Specifically for PC, relative rates of formation were 1.00–1.11, 2.46–2.71 and 1.37–1.41 for OPOs, SOs and HOSOs respectively. In CF, OPOs and HOSOs behaved similarly and better than SOs, although none reached 25% PC after 40 FO. The good performance of OPOs can be attributed to the high monounsaturated-to-polyunsaturated ratio, in common with HOSOs, and the additional positive effect of minor compounds, especially β-sitosterol and squalene.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHelianthus annuus 3aabsorption 3acolor 3adiacylglycerols 3aolive pomace 3asqualene1 aRuiz-Méndez, María Victoria1 aVelasco, Joaquín 1 aMárquez-Ruiz, Gloria 0 tFoods.g2021 Dec. 11, v. 10, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods101230813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01294naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245011600154300001800270520033500288592002800623650002300651650001100674650002300685650001300708650001200721700002200733700002000755773013400775856007400909852000900983655001200992IND60660276820221120101024.0190823e20140731xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066027682DNAL7 a10.1039/c4cc04545a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Wen10aInfluence of redox non-innocent phenylenediamido ligands on chromium imido hydrogen-atom abstraction reactivity  ap. 9958-9960.  aParamagnetic CpCr[(RN)₂C₆H₄] compounds (R = SiMe₃, CH₂CMe₃ and Ph) were treated with R′N₃ azides to generate chromium imido complexes, CpCr[(RN)₂C₆H₄](NR′), with R′ = adamantyl, aryl or SO₂Ar.

The current study systematically investigated the effects of hydrothermal processing of varying durations (15–120 min) on the texture, starch and protein digestibility of cowpeas (Vigna unguiculata), chickpeas (Cicer arietinum) and kidney beans (Phaseolus vulgaris). Texture analysis and in vitro oral-gastro-intestinal digestion of each legume was combined with kinetic modelling to explore the rate and extent of their changes observed during hydrothermal processing. All three legumes showed rapid initial texture decay in the first 30 min of processing. Chickpeas showed the fastest rate of texture degradation with processing duration, whereas texture degradation of kidney bean was slower but reached the lowest hardness value among all beans when processed up to 120 min. The rate of starch and protein digestion increased with prolonged processing duration, whilst showing an inverse relationship with texture values. The extent of starch digestion continually increased with processing duration for all three legumes, whereas the extent of protein digestion decreased after 60 min in cowpeas. This study systematically demonstrated how choosing different processing times can modulate the rate of texture degradation, starch and protein digestion in legumes. The findings of this study can aid consumers and manufacturers on optimal processing to achieve the desired texture or modulate starch and protein digestibility.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCicer arietinum 3aPhaseolus vulgaris 3aVigna unguiculata 3acowpeas 3adigestible protein 3adigestion 3afood security 3ahardness 3akidney beans 3akidneys 3astarch 3atexture1 aLeong, Sze Ying1 aKebede, Biniam 1 aOey, Indrawati 0 tFoods.g2021 June 18, v. 10, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods100614153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02789naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100002100169245011800190300001600308520068300324592002801007650002101035650001901056650001701075650001001092650001301102650002901115650006101144650003501205650006801240650006901308650003201377650003701409650003001446650001101476650004301487650001101530650001601541650004501557650002801602650002201630650002001652650002601672650001701698650001701715650002201732700001601754700001501770700001601785700001601801700001301817700001701830700002001847700001801867700001601885700001201901773009801913856008402011990002302095852000902118655001202127IND60092193620221121045600.0141103e20130901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009219362DNAL7 a236239232pmid7 a10.1016/j.canlet.2013.04.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Shuangyuan10aCD147 mediates chemoresistance in breast cancer via ABCG2 by affecting its cellular localization and dimerization  ap. 285-292.  aCD147 and ABCG2 both have been reported to mediate Multidrug resistance (MDR) in breast cancer. Recent study demonstrates that CD147 could form a complex with ABCG2 on the cell membrane in primary effusion lymphoma. However, whether these two molecules regulate each other in breast cancer and result in MDR is not clear. We established four MCF-7 cell lines transfected with CD147 and/or ABCG2 and found that CD147 could increase the expression and dimerization of ABCG2, affect its cellular localization and regulate its drug transporter function. The findings derived from cells were confirmed subsequently in clinic samples of chemotherapy-sensitive/resistant breast cancer.  aPublisher supplied data 3abreast neoplasms 3acell membranes 3adimerization 3adrugs 3alymphoma 3amultiple drug resistance 2aATP-Binding Cassette Transportersxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aBasiginxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aAntineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocolsxtherapeutic use 2aBreast Neoplasmsxdrug therapyxgeneticsxmetabolismxpathology. 2aCell Survivalxdrug effects 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aDrug Resistance, Neoplasm 2aFemale 2aGene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic 2aHumans 2aMCF-7 Cells 2aNeoplasm Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aProtein Multimerization 2aProtein Transport 2aRNAxmetabolism 2aRetrospective Studies 2aTime Factors 2aTransfection 2aTreatment Outcome1 aLiao, Liqiu1 aChen, Chen1 aZeng, Weiqi1 aLiu, Shuang1 aSu, Juan1 aZhao, Shuang1 aChen, Mingliang1 aKuang, Yehong1 aChen, Xiang1 aLi, Jie0 tCancer letters.g2013 Sept. 1, v. 337, no. 2 p.285-292dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0304-38357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.canlet.2013.04.0253Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02070naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001800143245008900161300001400250520092400264592002801188650001501216650002101231650001201252650001401264650002001278650002201298653001901320653002101339653003301360700003801393700002601431700001701457773014801474856007701622852000901699655001201708IND60522258620221121004213.0160602e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052225862DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-2005-01122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDrebov, Nedko10aPhotoswitching of Redox Potentials and Spectroscopic Properties in the UV/vis Region  ap. 75-82.  aThe photoswitching of optical and electrochemical properties of di-donor, di-acceptor and donor-acceptor substituted photochromic tetrahydropyrene - [2,2]metacyclophanene and dihydropyrene - [2,2]metacyclophanediene systems has been studied theoretically. A switching of the halfwave oxidation and reduction potentials should be possible in the case of bis(pyridinium) and bis(hydroxyphenyl) substituted systems. Because of the relatively great perturbation of the planarity of the π-electron systems by large torsion of the substituents out of the π-electron structure of the photochromic system and the stair-like structure of the ring-opened isomer, relatively large excitation energies for CT transitions have been calculated with the AM1-CI procedure. The ring-closed structures should absorb in the visible spectral region, and the open-ring isomers should have a longest-wavelength absorption in the UV region.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aelectrochemistry 3aisomers 3aoxidation 3aredox potential 3aspectral analysis 0aPhotoswitching 0aRedox Properties 0aAbsorption spectra in UV/vis1 aTi︠u︡ti︠u︡lkov, Nikolaĭ,1 aKarabunarliev, Stojan1 aDietz, Fritz0 tZeitschrift für Naturforschung.g2014 June 2, v. 60, no. 1 p.75-82dVerlag der Zeitschrift für NaturforschungwJournal:23182x0932-07767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/znb-2005-01123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02342naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245011700157300001800274500002000292520105900312592002801371650001601399650001101415650001701426650001001443650002301453650001401476650001901490650001101509650001901520650002801539650001601567650001401583651001601597700002201613700001601635700002001651700001901671773013501690856007401825852000901899655001201908IND60585659320221118024252.0171112e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058565932DNAL7 a10.1111/ijfs.135422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Pui Yee10aInvestigating consumers' perception of apple juice as affected by novel and conventional processing technologies  ap. 2564-2571.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThis work evaluates consumers' perception of apple juice processed by high pressure processing (HPP) and pulsed electric field (PEF) compared with thermal processing. As a case study, young Chinese immigrants living in New Zealand were selected. Targeting a broad understanding of process impact, three industrially relevant apple cultivars (New Zealand Jazz, Rose and Granny Smith) were chosen. The consumer study was performed using napping with ultra‐flash profiling technique (n = 38). The process impact on sensory perception seems to vary among the investigated apple cultivars. For Jazz and Granny Smith apple cultivars, PEF‐ and HPP‐treated juices are perceived as fresh, natural, sweet and balanced flavour. For Rose apple cultivar, however PEF‐processed juices appear to be perceived as fresh flavour in comparison with HPP and thermally treated juices. Moreover, thermal processing caused cooked flavour. With respect to colour, immediately after processing, HPP retains the natural apple juice colour compared with other treatments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapple juice 3aapples 3acase studies 3acolor 3aconsumer attitudes 3acultivars 3aelectric field 3aflavor 3aheat treatment 3ahigh pressure treatment 3aimmigration 3asensation 3aNew Zealand1 aKebede, Biniam T.1 aLusk, Karen1 aMirosa, Miranda1 aOey, Indrawati0 tInternational journal of food science & technology.g2017 Dec., v. 52, no. 12 p.2564-2571dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0950-54237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ijfs.135423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01124naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001300138245007300151300001600224520019300240592002800433650002300461650002300484650001400507650001400521650000700535650001600542700002500558700002000583773012600603856007200729852000900801655001200810IND60657592820221121064353.0190816e20050112xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065759282DNAL7 a10.1039/b412330a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNgai, To10aNovel emulsions stabilized by pH and temperature sensitive microgels  ap. 331-333.  aSurfactant-free oil-in-water emulsions prepared with temperature and pH sensitive poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) microgel particles offer unprecedented control of emulsion stability.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical compounds 3achemical reactions 3aemulsions 3amicrogels 3apH 3atemperature1 aBehrens, Sven Holger1 aAuweter, Helmut0 tChemical communications.g2005 Jan. 12, , no. 3 p.331-333dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b412330a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02906naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001200147245009200159520168000251592002801931650002101959650001401980650001401994650001702008650001702025650001702042650001902059650001402078650002102092650001302113650002202126650001302148650001402161650002402175653002702199653002002226653000902246700001402255700001402269773009802283856008202381852000902463655001202472IND60679905420221122104752.0200217e20200215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067990542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lfs.2019.1172342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQiu, Li10aTargeted inhibition of ULK1 enhances daunorubicin sensitivity in acute myeloid leukemia  aIn acute myeloid leukemia (AML), complete remission can be achieved in parts of patients using cytarabine/anthracycline combination-based chemotherapy, however, drug resistance-related recurrence is still a common cause of treatment failure, leading to high mortality among patients. In our research, we revealed the molecular mechanisms that were sufficient to improve sensitivity of AML cells to the anthracycline daunorubicin (DNR).We evaluated the effects of autophagy and apoptosis induced by DNR using two AML cell lines HL60 and U937.Western blot was preformed to analyze the apoptotic pathway protein expression and flow cytometric analysis was used to detect the level of apoptosis in AML cells. The levels of autophagy-related proteins were detected by western blotting and autophagic vesicles were observed by electron microscopy.DNR effectively induced autophagy in two AML cell lines HL60 and U937 confirming by upregulation of LC3-II lipidation, formation of autophagosomes. Inhibition of autophagy by pharmacologic inhibitor HCQ promoted apoptosis induced by DNR, suggesting that autophagy played a vital role in pro-survival in AML. Furthermore, ULK1 inhibition by a highly selective kinase inhibitor SBI-0206965 and shRNA enhanced cytotoxicity of DNR against AML cells. Independent of mTOR -ULK1 signaling pathway, activation of autophagy of DNR was proved to be mediated by AMPK (pThr172)/ULK1 pathway.These results revealed that pro-survival autophagy induced by ULK1 activation was one of the potential mechanisms of AML resistance to DNR. Targeting ULK1 selectively could be a promising therapeutic strategy to enhance sensitivity of DNR for AML therapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern blotting 3aapoptosis 3aautophagy 3acytotoxicity 3adaunorubicin 3adrug therapy 3aflow cytometry 3amortality 3amyeloid leukemia 3apatients 3aprotein synthesis 3aproteins 3aremission 3asignal transduction 0aAcute myeloid leukemia 0aDrug resistance 0aULK11 aZhou, Gan1 aCao, Shan0 tLife sciences.g2020 Feb. 15, v. 243 p.117234-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11720x0024-32057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2019.1172343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03195naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002600139245015100165300001400316500001100330520194900341592002802290596004102318650002502359650001102384650001502395650000902410650001302419650002102432650001202453650001802465650001002483650001402493650001402507650000902521650001402530650001802544651001902562773011002581856007302691852000902764655001202773IND60679307020221123043504.0191227e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067930702DNAL7 a10.1111/mam.121742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBroughton, Richard K.10aCurrent and future impacts of nest predation and nest‐site competition by invasive eastern grey squirrels Sciurus carolinensis on European birds  ap. 38-51.  aREVIEW  aThe eastern grey squirrel (hereafter ‘grey squirrel’) is considered one of the most damaging invasive alien species in Europe, with negative effects on native ecosystems. Despite it being widely perceived as a significant predator of bird eggs and chicks and as a competitor for nest sites, evaluation of the grey squirrel’s impact on European bird populations has been hindered by limited empirical data. The aim was to review the incidence of grey squirrels as nest predators of and nest‐site competitors with European birds, and to use this information to identify species at potential risk of negative effects from within the grey squirrel’s expanding range in continental Europe. A comprehensive literature review was conducted, and the data were used alongside additional new data, to assess nest predation and competition by grey squirrels in their current European range. Bird species were grouped by nest‐site type, which was used to predict the impact on similar species groups in regions of continental Europe predicted to be colonised by grey squirrels in the current century. Camera‐monitoring and field evidence for 12 bird species and 12420 nests in Britain showed that grey squirrels rarely depredated eggs or chicks, affecting just 0.5% of nests. Nest‐site competition was also minor, with grey squirrels occupying 0.8% of 122 small tree cavities and 14% of 57 larger cavities. At least 69 bird species in continental Europe could be exposed to potential nest predation or competition from expanding grey squirrel populations within the current century, but population‐level effects currently appear to be unlikely. Current evidence shows that grey squirrels are unlikely to be significant predators of or competitors with nesting birds in their present or projected range in Europe. However, further studies of more species in different regions would be valuable, particularly in urban and suburban habitats.  aPublisher supplied data  cNatural Environment Research Council 3aSciurus carolinensis 3achicks 3aecosystems 3aeggs 3ahabitats 3ainvasive species 3anesting 3anesting sites 3anests 3apredation 3apredators 3arisk 3asquirrels 3atree cavities 3aUnited Kingdom0 tMammal review.g2020 Jan., v. 50, no. 1 p.38-51dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl7552x0305-18387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mam.121743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02561naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001500143245011500158520141600273592002801689650001501717650001301732650000901745650001901754650002401773650001101797650001601808650001401824650001001838650001601848700001501864700001501879700001601894700001501910700001601925700001701941773011901958856007702077852000902154655001202163IND60742545420221120154312.0210624e20210618xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074254542DNAL7 a10.3390/foods100614192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Tao 10aInvestigation on the Molecular and Physicochemical Changes of Protein and Starch of Wheat Flour during Heating  aThe behaviors of starch and protein in wheat flour during heating were investigated, and the molecular changes of starch and protein and their effects on the textural characteristics were assessed. The results showed that with the increased temperature, soluble protein aggregated to insoluble high-molecular-weight protein polymers when the heating temperature exceeded 70 °C, and the aggregation of protein was mainly caused by covalent bonds of disulfide (SS) bonds. Hydrophobic interaction was the main noncovalent bond that participated in the formation of protein aggregates. The major change in the secondary structure during heating was a pronounced transition towards β-sheet-like structures. Considerable disruption of ordered structures of starch occurred at 70 °C, and starch was fully gelatinized at 80 °C. Typical starch pasting profiles of cooked flour were observed when the temperature was below 70 °C, and heat treatment decreased the pasting viscosity of the cooked flour from control to 80 °C, whereas the viscosity of the wheat flour increased in heating treatment at 90, 95 and 100 °C. The intense protein-starch interaction during heating affected the textural characteristic of flour gelation, which showed higher strength at 90, 95 and 100 °C. This study may provide a basis for improving wheat flour processing conditions and could lead to the production of new wheat products.  aPublisher supplied data 3adisulfides 3agelation 3aheat 3aheat treatment 3ahydrophobic bonding 3astarch 3atemperature 3aviscosity 3awheat 3awheat flour1 aWang, Pei 1 aZhou, Qin 1 aWang, Xiao 1 aCai, Jian 1 aHuang, Mei 1 aJiang, Dong 0 tFoods.g2021 June 18, v. 10, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods100614193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03318naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245016300154300001800317520151500335592002801850650001601878650001701894650001801911650002801929650002501957650001401982650001301996650001502009650002102024650002702045650002102072650002002093650001802113650002602131650002002157650000902177650001402186650001502200650002302215650001302238650002702251650002502278650003202303650004002335651001002375700001502385700001502400700001602415700002902431700001402460700001702474700001702491773012502508856007402633852000902707655001202716IND60639968020221119054627.0190503e20171115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063996802DNAL7 a10.1039/c7fo00769h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Yong14aThe phenolic profiles of Radix Tetrastigma after solid phase extraction (SPE) and their antitumor effects and antioxidant activities in H22 tumor-bearing mice  ap. 4014-4027.  aRadix Tetrastigma (RT), a herbal medicine and functional food in China, showed strong antiproliferative activities in vitro. However, the effects and the underlying mechanism of phenolic-rich extract of RT in H22 tumor-bearing mice are still unknown. Thus, the phenolic profiles and antitumor/antioxidant activities of a solid phase extraction (SPE) semi-purified extract of RT were investigated by a combination of chemical assays, LC-QTOF-MS/LC-QqQ-MS techniques and a tumor-bearing mice model. As a result, the total phenolic/flavonoid contents (TPC/TFC) and 24 individual phenolics were identified and quantified, which showed higher contents than that of crude extract. Results also indicated that RT extract could inhibit tumor growth and induce apoptosis by regulating the expression of Bcl-2 family proteins and activating the caspase family proteins as well as suppressing tumor angiogenesis by inhibiting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression. Besides, the interleukin-2 (IL-2) levels, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) production, CD4⁺/CD8⁺ ratio, and NK cell levels were increased by RT administration, while RT significantly increased superoxide dismutase (SOD)/glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activities and decreased malondialdehyde (MDA) content. Summarily, the findings clearly demonstrated that RT extract could inhibit tumor growth by inducing apoptosis and inhibiting angiogenesis as well as preventing cancer by improving the immune functions and antioxidant activities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTetrastigma 3aangiogenesis 3aanimal models 3aantineoplastic activity 3aantioxidant activity 3aapoptosis 3acaspases 3aflavonoids 3afunctional foods 3aglutathione peroxidase 3aherbal medicines 3aimmune response 3ainterleukin-2 3aliquid chromatography 3amalondialdehyde 3amice 3aneoplasms 3aperoxidase 3aphenolic compounds 3aproteins 3asolid phase extraction 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3avascular endothelial growth factors 3aChina1 aTsao, Rong1 aChen, Fang1 aLi, Hongyan1 aHan, Pengc(Law teacher)1 aJiang, Li1 aChen, Yuhuan1 aDeng, Zeyuan0 tFood & function.g2017 Nov. 15, v. 8, no. 11 p.4014-4027dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26907x2042-650X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7fo00769h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03446naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100005600138245012100194300001800315500002000333520185700353592002802210596007002238596003402308650001002342650002902352650001202381650001102393650002302404650002502427650001302452650002302465650001202488650001302500650001302513650002702526650001502553650001402568650003402582650000902616650001202625650001202637651001702649651001302666700005702679773012302736856007202859852000902931655001202940IND60679307220221123043530.0191227e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067930722DNAL7 a10.1002/aqc.32212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSharpe, Matt1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4828-158810aIndian Ocean humpback dolphin in the Menai Bay off the south coast of Zanzibar, East Africa is Critically Endangered  ap. 2133-2146.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aCetaceans occupying coastal habitats are at high risk of impact from anthropogenic sources which can cause direct mortality or affect long‐term health. Monitoring and detecting change require long‐term studies and reliable funding, not always available especially in developing countries. Management and conservation of cetaceans must therefore use precautionary methods that allow assessment from limited data sources to identify risk of, and prevent, species extirpation or extinction. IUCN Red List criteria for regional populations was applied to the population of Indian Ocean humpback dolphins (Sousa plumbea) resident in Menai Bay Conservation Area off the south coast of Zanzibar, East Africa which is subjected to unsustainable entanglement rates in gillnet fisheries and unregulated tourism activities. Photographic identification surveys were conducted in 2015 to generate a new abundance estimate from capture–recapture analysis. Mortality estimates were calculated using available data from 1999 to 2002 and a population viability analysis was conducted based on population, species and genus specific parameters. The 2015 abundance estimate for humpback dolphins was 19 (95% CI 14–25) non‐calf individuals, representing a 63% reduction in abundance since 2002. The population viability analysis baseline scenario predicted chance of extinction at 0.996 (SE 0.002) with the median time to extinction at 36 years. Sensitivity analysis suggested that population recovery would only be possible with a complete prevention of bycatch mortality. The population met the threshold for Critically Endangered for all criteria which could be directly assessed. This conservation assessment highlights the requirement for immediate management action to eliminate bycatch of humpback dolphins to prevent the local extinction of the species.  aPublisher supplied data  aMASMA/CP/2014/01cWestern Indian Ocean Marine Science Association  cWildlife Conservation Society 3aSousa 3aanthropogenic activities 3abycatch 3acoasts 3aconservation areas 3adeveloping countries 3adolphins 3aendangered species 3afunding 3agillnets 3ahabitats 3amark-recapture studies 3amonitoring 3amortality 3apopulation viability analysis 3arisk 3asurveys 3atourism 3aIndian Ocean 3aZanzibar1 aBerggren, P.,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8204-72560 tAquatic conservation.g2019 Dec., v. 29, no. 12 p.2133-2146dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl51367x1052-76137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/aqc.32213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02377naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245014000174300001600314520103300330592002801363650001701391650001301408650001601421650001301437650002001450650001101470650001101481650001301492650001401505650001001519650001601529650001501545650001101560653001601571653001701587653001901604653002901623700002201652700002001674700002901694773010001723856008701823852000901910655001201919IND60542211720221122035339.0190402e20140701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054221172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2014.01.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCendres, Aurélie10aDifferent compounds are extracted with different time courses from fruits during microwave hydrodiffusion: Examples and possible causes  ap. 179-186.  aWe set out to determine how nutrients diffuse during extraction, using fractional collection. The highest concentrations of sugars (195.5, 64.8 and 60.8g/L, respectively for grape, ‘Najbolia’ plum and apricot) were found for the earliest stages of extraction, with a decrease in concentration (to 41.4g/L, 48.2g/L and 1.7g/L, respectively) at the end of extraction process. Total polyphenols showed the same trends for plum and apricot (from 4.1g/L to 2.9g/L for ‘Najbolia’ plum, from 2.2 to 0.2g/L for apricot) but highest concentrations of total polyphenols (for grape and cherry) were obtained at fraction 5 or 6 (out of 7). Carotenoids from cherry tomato also had highest concentrations (at circa 25mg/L) almost at the end of extraction. For volatile molecules from sweet cherry, hexanal, 2-hexenal and linalool had their highest concentrations at fractions 3–4 (out of 7).Diffusion of nutrients depended on fruit destructuring, molecule solubility and localization of the compounds.

Artificial inoculation with Colletotrichum lindemuthianum was performed and the infection rate assessed on technologically mature bean pods. Healthy tissue, symptomatic spot, and bordering tissue were analyzed. Primary and secondary metabolites were quantified with the use of HPLC and phenolics further identified with HPLC-MS-ESI. Fructose and glucose were the prevalent sugars in French bean pods, and malic acid the major organic acid identified in healthy tissue of all analyzed cultivars. The greatest infection rate was observed on green bean pods of the susceptible ‘Top Crop’ and ‘Re dei Burri’ cultivars. The infection rate of the ‘Paulista’ cultivar following artificial inoculation was only 0.8% which is indicative of its tolerance to the C. lindemuthianum fungus. Twenty five different phenolic compounds were determined and categorized in the following phenolic groups: hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives, flavan-3-ols, dihydrochalcones and flavonols. The content levels of all phenolic groups increased in bordering tissue and symptomatic spot after infection in all cultivars. Tolerant/resistant ‘Paulista’ and ‘Berggold’ cultivars were also characterized by higher content levels of flavan-3-ols (procyanidins and catechin), dihydrochalcones (phloretin, phloridzin) and specific flavonol glycosides.  aPublisher supplied data 3aColletotrichum lindemuthianum 3aanthracnose 3acatechin 3acoumaric acids 3acultivars 3aflavonols 3afructose 3afungi 3aglucose 3agreen beans 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3amalic acid 3aphloridzin 3apods 3aprocyanidins 3asecondary metabolites 0aPhaseolus vulgaris L. 0aColletotrichum lindemuthianum 0aOrganic acids 0aSugars 0aPhenolic compounds 0aInfection 0aResistance1 aSchmitzer, Valentina1 aJakopic, Jerneja1 aCunja, Vlasta1 aVeberic, Robert1 aMunda, Alenka1 aŠtampar, Franci,0 tScientia horticulturae.g2014 May 07, v. 170 p.211-218dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4108x0304-42387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2014.03.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03230naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245007600168300001600244500001900260520184000279536013502119592002802254596001702282650003502299650001702334650001602351650001302367650001302380650001302393650001402406650001702420653001302437653001202450653000902462653001102471653001102482653001302493700001802506700001702524700001702541773012002558856008502678852000902763655001202772IND60719845120221119014241.0201207e20200702xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071984512DNAL7 a10.1080/1059924X.2020.17655672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOatman, Jill10aJA:2021-21. Improving Safety and Health in the Cattle Feedyard Industry  ap. 247-248.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIntroduction: In 2014, the occupational fatality rate was 116 fatalities/100,000 workers in the beef cattle ranching and farming industries (including feedyards). This rate was four times higher than the rate in the agriculture, forestry, and ﬁshing sector overall (24.9/100,000) and 34 times higher than the rate in all industries combined (3.4/100,000). The cattle feedyard subsector also has exceptionally high non-fatal injury and illness rates. In 2013, hired workers in the beef cattle ranching and farming (including feedyards) had a “days away from work” rate of 258.8/10,000, while the rate for all industries combined was 99.9/10,000. The Central States Center for Agricultural Safety and Health (CS-CASH) is ideally located to conduct such research, as half of the feedyards in the United States are located in the Center’s region. Purpose: The propose of this project is to reduce the burden of injuries and illnesses among feedyard workers by developing, implementing, and evaluating a comprehensive feedyard safety and health training program. Methods (if applicable): The Specific Aims of this project are to develop and implement a comprehensive feedyard safety and health training program and evaluate the efficacy of the comprehensive feedyard safety and health training program. Results/Findings: This project is research in progress. A portion of the comprehensive feedyard safety and health training program, known as the Feedyard 15, have been created, and trainings with the Feedyard 15 materials have begun at several feedyards in the CS-CASH region. Practical Application: This project is developing high-quality safety and health materials through a consensus process that involves stakeholders from the feedyard industry. Once tested in a subset of the industry, they will be available industry wide.  aSupported by the Central States Center for Agricultural Safety and Health (CS-CASH) through NIH-NIOSH award number U54 OH010162.  aPublisher supplied data  aU54 OH010162 3aagricultural health and safety 3aagromedicine 3abeef cattle 3afeedlots 3aforestry 3aindustry 3amortality 3astakeholders 0aFeedyard 0afeedlot 0abeef 0asafety 0ahealth 0atraining1 aRamos, Athena1 aKeenan, Mike1 aYoder, Aaron0 tJournal of agromedicine.g2020 July 02, v. 25, no. 3 p.247-248dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl51337x1545-08137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1059924X.2020.17655673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02232naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245006500167300002000232520131600252592002801568650000801596650001701604650001901621650001701640650001601657650001301673700001801686700001801704773010101722856008601823852000901909655001201918IND60577538920221118040411.0170809e20161101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057753892DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.6b020662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeng, Shuhua10aCollective Effects in Microbubble Growth by Solvent Exchange  ap. 11265-11272.  aRegulating the formation and growth of microscopic bubbles at solid–liquid interfaces is essential in many physical, chemical, and catalytic processes, such as the electrolysis of water or a dry–wet transition of a superhydrophobic surface. The growth of bubbles in a group is influenced by the neighboring bubbles as well as the overall gas concentration in the system. In this work, we have investigated the growth of multiple microbubbles on highly ordered hydrophobic microcavity arrays, seeded by pre-existing gas pockets trapped inside the cavities. A pulse of gas oversaturation at an extremely low level was supplied in a process we call solvent exchange. Our results show that the distance between the seeding air pockets has significant effects on the location, number density, and size of bubbles on the array. With closely spaced microcavities, growing microbubbles self-organized into symmetric patterns. Their growth rate was enhanced at the corners and edges of the array, and interior bubbles dissolved because of the competitive growth. By contrast, no symmetric patterns were observed when the space between the microcavities was large. The findings reported in this work provide important insights into solvent exchange and collective interactions in the formation of surface nanobubbles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aelectrolysis 3ahydrophobicity 3amicrobubbles 3ananobubbles 3asolvents1 aMega, Tony L.1 aZhang, Xuehua0 tLangmuir.g2016 Nov. 01, v. 32, no. 43 p.11265-11272dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.langmuir.6b020663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02371naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002500152245007200177300001600249520100200265592002801267650001001295650002001305650001901325650001601344650001401360650001301374650001301387650001301400650001001413650001901423650001001442650002401452650001501476650001201491650002301503650001701526653001501543653001001558653001001568653001301578653002301591700001901614700001801633700001801651773010001669856008701769852000901856655001201865IND60542211820221122051421.0190402e20140701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054221182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2014.01.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRuiz-García, Leonor10aPrediction of Muscat aroma in table grape by analysis of rose oxide  ap. 151-157.  aAroma is an important quality characteristic in Muscat grapes and constitutes a major concern for viticulturist and grapevine breeders. For this reason, Muscat aroma variability was characterised in a segregating progeny and in a collection of table grapes, to assess the usefulness of the presence or absence of rose oxide for predicting Muscat genotypes. Simple tasting and an analysis of free and bound aroma compounds, including rose oxide, linalool oxide, linalool, α-terpineol, citronellol, nerol, geraniol, benzyl alcohol and 2-phenylethanol, were carried out. The association between Muscat score and the compounds considered as active odorants according to their odour activity values was also evaluated. The results obtained pointed to a highly significant correlation between the presence/absence of rose oxide in grapes and the presence/absence of Muscat aroma. Thus, this analysis could be a useful tool for identifying Muscat cultivars in a more objective way than sensory analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVitis 3aalpha-terpineol 3abenzyl alcohol 3acitronellol 3acultivars 3agenotype 3ageraniol 3alinalool 3anerol 3aodor compounds 3aodors 3aphenylethyl alcohol 3aprediction 3aprogeny 3asensory evaluation 3atable grapes 0aRose oxide 0aAroma 0aGrape 0aTerpenes 0aGas chromatography1 aHellín, Pilar1 aFlores, Pilar1 aFenoll, José0 tFood chemistry.g2014 July 01, v. 154 p.151-157dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2014.01.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02909naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245007700172300001800249500001500267520142500282592002801707650001001735650001501745650002301760650001001783650001501793650002101808650000801829650001601837650001901853650002101872650002201893650002201915650001801937650002201955650001601977650001701993653001702010700002902027700002002056700002002076700002102096700001902117700001902136700002902155773011702184856008102301852000902382655001202391IND60440629920221119180734.0151024e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044062992DNAL7 a10.1007/s12665-015-4501-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTzovolou, Dimitra N.10aIn situ bioventing of the vadose zone of multi-scale heterogeneous soils  ap. 4907-4925.  a2019-12-06  aA bioventing pilot test was performed on one cell of the vadose zone of a low permeability and fractured site polluted by jet fuel. Air was injected and extracted through hydraulic fractures that were installed to enhance effectively the horizontal permeability of the soil. The biodegradability of pollutants was evaluated with lab-scale studies in batch reactors and soil columns, respectively. To assess the process efficiency, soil samples were collected from seven depths of twelve wells of the pilot Cell, the hydrocarbons were extracted with dichloromethane, and analyzed with gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy and gas chromatography/flame ionization detection. Data obtained from the complete characterization of the pore structure of the soil were employed to understand the main mechanisms of pollutant removal. Due to the heterogeneous nature of the porous matrix over a broad range of pore sizes (from 1 nm to 1 mm), the rate of intrinsic biodegradation of jet fuel in matrix was limited. The main pollutant removal mechanism was the ventilation in which most volatile hydrocarbons vaporized and diffused toward the gas phase that was flowing along the preferential flow pathways. Hydraulic fractures facilitated and accelerated the pollutant remediation rate by enhancing the interconnectivity of the porous matrix with natural fracture systems or any other type of natural preferential flow pathway.  aPublisher supplied data 3awells 3abioventing 3amethylene chloride 3afuels 3apollutants 3aflame ionization 3aair 3aremediation 3abiodegradation 3abiodegradability 3asoil permeability 3amass spectrometry 3asoil sampling 3apreferential flow 3avadose zone 3apermeability 0ahydrocarbons1 aTheodoropoulou, Maria A.1 aBlanchet, Denis1 aHaeseler, Frank1 aJeczalik, Maciej1 aKasela, Tomasz1 aSlack, William1 aTsakiroglou, Christos D.0 tEnvironmental earth sciences.g2015 Sept., v. 74, no. 6 p.4907-4925dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1866-62807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-015-4501-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02405naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245012100168300001400289520099300303592002801296650001601324650002001340650001601360650001801376650002201394650001501416650001601431650002201447653002601469653001701495653003301512653002801545653002101573653003601594653000801630653000701638653000801645653000801653653000801661653000801669653000801677700002201685773012101707856008601828852000901914655001201923IND60533306320221122085620.0190319e20140526xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053330632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2014.03.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSeginer, Ido10aShort and long term vegetative growth response to temperature, interpreted by the dynamics of a carbohydrate storage  ap. 14-26.  aGrowth models are an important element of rational crop management. In an attempt to produce a model suitable for greenhouse environmental-control, we further develop an available model with variable storage of non-structural carbohydrate (NSC). The model considers the supply and demand of carbohydrate and can simulate the daily storage cycle as well as long term transient acclimation processes. Model predictions agree qualitatively rather well with whole-plant experimental correlations between NSC content and growth, and with measured growth as a function of temperature. The model also mimics successfully both the short- and the long-term effects of temperature on respiration. This is achieved by expressing growth respiration as a product of (1) a function of the NSC content (representing the long-term effect of temperature), and (2) a function of the current temperature (representing the short-term effect). The use of the model as a control tool by the grower is outlined.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacclimation 3acrop management 3agreenhouses 3agrowth models 3along term effects 3aprediction 3atemperature 3avegetative growth 0aEnvironmental control 0aGrowth model 0aDynamic carbohydrate storage 0aResponse to temperature 0aCrop acclimation 0aCarbohydrate-growth correlation 0aDAS 0aDM 0aNSC 0aPAR 0aRGR 0aSGT 0aTDM1 aGent, Martin P.N.0 tScientia horticulturae.g2014 May 26, v. 171 p.14-26dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4108x0304-42387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2014.03.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03046naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001100148245015300159300001800312520147700330592002801807650001601835650003001851650001901881650002901900650001601929650000901945650001701954650001901971650001601990650000902006650001102015650002102026653003202047653001102079653002802090653002702118653001002145653001602155700001502171700001802186700001602204700001602220700001402236700002002250700001802270773014802288856008302436852000902519655001202528IND60612853320221121064529.0201202e20180101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061285332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2017.11.1482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yu10aRepetitive restraint stress changes spleen immune cell subsets through glucocorticoid receptor or β-adrenergic receptor in a stage dependent manner  ap. 1108-1114.  aImmune system is sensitive to stress. Spleen is the largest peripheral immune organ innervated with sympathetic nerves and controlled by adrenomedullary system in the body. However, the alterations and mechanism of spleen immune cell subsets caused by repetitive restraint stress (RRS) is poorly understood. In this study, we found that RRS reduced spleen index in mice, and induced an expansion of white pulp and involution of the red pulp. Meanwhile, the percentage of CD3⁺CD8⁺ T lymphocytes, CD11b⁺F4/80⁺ macrophages, CD11b⁺Ly-6G⁻Ly-6Cʰⁱ monocytic myeloid derived suppressor cells (mMDSCs) and CD11b⁺Ly-6G⁺Ly-6Cⁱⁿᵗ granulocytic myeloid derived suppressor cells (gMDSCs) in spleen were significantly changed by RRS. Mechanistically, we found that the expression of norepinephrine (NE) and β-adrenergic receptor (β-AR) in spleen were up-regulated after 21 days of RRS, but not 7 days. The expression of corticosterone (CORT) and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in spleen were up-regulated after 7 days of RRS but were lower after 21 days of RRS, even though they were still higher than that in mice without stress. By treating the stressed mice with RU486 (antagonist of GR) or propranolol (antagonist of β-AR), we demonstrated that GR was responsible for the changes of spleen induced by 7 days of RRS and β-AR was for 21 days of RRS. Our data suggest that RRS changes spleen immune cell subsets through GR or β-AR in a stage dependent manner.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantagonists 3abeta adrenergic receptors 3acorticosterone 3aglucocorticoid receptors 3amacrophages 3amice 3anerve tissue 3anorepinephrine 3apropranolol 3apulp 3aspleen 3asuppressor cells 0aRepetitive restraint stress 0aSpleen 0aGlucocorticoid receptor 0aβ-adrenergic receptor 0aRU486 0aPropranolol1 aJiang, Wei1 aLi, Zhen-zhen1 aZhang, Chen1 aHuang, Chen1 aYang, Jun1 aKong, Guang-yao1 aLi, Zong-fang0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2018 Jan. 01, v. 495, no. 1 p.1108-1114dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2017.11.1483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03923naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245011300162500001900275500002000294520212500314592002802439596007302467596005602540596005202596596007902648596007902727650001902806650001702825650001302842650001602855650001502871650001102886650002102897650002302918650001702941650001502958650002802973650001803001700002503019700006003044700006103104700005803165773013503223856007403358852000903432655001203441IND60729902720221122051038.0210304e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072990272DNAL7 a10.1111/jfpe.136272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRamirez, Natalia,10aEffect of pulsed vacuum and laser microperforations on the potential acceleration of chicken meat marination  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aChicken meat marination has become a fundamental process in the poultry industry since it provides a product with better sensory attributes. The objective of this study was to examine the effect of CO₂ laser microperforation coupled with vacuum impregnation treatment on the marination processing time of chicken breasts and to mathematically analyze the marinade diffusion process using Fick's second law and an anomalous diffusion model. Cylindrical cuts of unmarinated chicken meat were CO₂‐laser microperforated with pores of 228 μm and marinated under vacuum pressure (15 kPa) with NaCl (3% wt/wt) and sodium tripolyphosphate (1% wt/wt) during 60 hr at 6 ° C. The chicken:brine ratio was 1:11 wt/wt. Mass gain, moisture content, and salt concentration were determined over time; furthermore, effective diffusion coefficient (Dₑff) was obtained using Fick's second law and anomalous diffusion models. Marinade diffusion into chicken cuts was favored by microperforation combined with vacuum pulses, reduction processing time in 34%. The Dₑff ranged between 1.46 × 10⁻¹⁰ and 2.08 × 10⁻¹⁰m²/s for Fick's second law and between 2.27 × 10⁻¹⁰ and 4.23 × 10⁻¹⁰m²/sᵅ for anomalous diffusion model, with α−values close to 1. In conclusion, the results showed no significant difference between the models, which was attributed to the homogeneity of the chicken tissue. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Chicken meat marination has become a fundamental process in the poultry industry since it provides a product with better sensory attributes and shelf life than unmarinated chicken meat. Nevertheless, marination is a process that requires a long processing time to obtain a specified salt content in the meat. In this sense, laser microperforation of the meat is a treatment that when coupled with vacuum impregnation, can accelerate the marinating process of poultry meat. When simultaneously applying both technologies, the processing time was reduced by 6 hr compared with the control (almost 34%), which will allow a significant increase in plant productivity.  aPublisher supplied data  cFood Laboratory of the Department of Chemical Engineering of the USM  cPostgraduate Program and Programs Directorate (DPP)  cScientific Initiation Incentives Program (PIIC)  a1191280cFondo Nacional de Desarrollo Científico y Tecnológico (CONICYT)  a1181270cFondo Nacional de Desarrollo Científico y Tecnológico (CONICYT) 3acarbon dioxide 3achicken meat 3achickens 3adiffusivity 3amarinating 3amodels 3apoultry industry 3asalt concentration 3asalt content 3ashelf life 3asodium tripolyphosphate 3awater content1 aVega‐Castro, Oscar1 aSimpson, Ricardo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6040-43871 aRamirez, Cristian1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7339-47661 aNuñez, Helena1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6168-451X0 tJournal of food process engineering.g2021 Mar., v. 44, no. 3 p.e13627-dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl8651x0145-88767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfpe.136273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03845naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245011300176300001600289500001900305520194700324536040702271592002802678596004502706650001302751650003502764650001702799650001502816650001002831650002302841650001102864650001002875650001702885650001502902650002302917651002902940653002402969653001102993653001103004653001403015653001703029700001803046700002103064700001703085700002303102773012003125856008503245852000903330655001203339IND60719845420221119012738.0201207e20200702xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071984542DNAL7 a10.1080/1059924X.2020.17655762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPloeckelman, Melissa10aJA:2021-24. Telling the Story – Using Storytelling to Disseminate Agricultural Safety and Health Messaging  ap. 249-250.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPurpose: Narrative is perhaps the most basic mode of human interaction and a fundamental way of delivering knowledge. Narratives influence attitudes and change behaviors. NIOSH-funded agricultural safety and health centers including the Great Plains Center for Agricultural Health (GPCAH), the Upper Midwest Agricultural Safety and Health Center (UMASH), the Central States Center for Agricultural Safety and Health (CS-CASH), and the National Farm Medicine Center are collaborating on a translation activity to convey the story of agricultural safety. While statistics and numbers are important to identify injury trends and emerging issues related to workplace health and safety, the Telling the Story Project (TTS) takes a closer look, creating injury prevention messages that highlight personal stories based on first-hand experiences. Methods: Research indicates that farmers are more open to safety messages after reading about a traumatic farm incident, and farmers generally consider other farmers and agricultural publications to be trusted sources of information. Telling the Story Project provides a platform for agricultural workers, and those impacted by fatal and non-fatal agricultural workplace injuries (workers, family, and community members), to share their stories. Told in their own words, these experiences teach about what went wrong and how to prevent or avoid similar incidents. Results: A website was created and serves as a platform for the personal narratives www.tellingthestoryproject.org. A monthly rural radio program has emerged from this project as another means to deliver this content effectively. Links to safety and health information provide resources for those visiting the website. Evaluation of stakeholder impact is ongoing. Practical Application: To further the reach of these stories, teachers’ guides have been created as additions to the curriculum for FFA and agricultural safety instructors.  aFunding for Telling the Story Project provided through a cooperative agreement from the National Institutes of Occupational Safety and Health, Agriculture, Forestry, and Fishing Grant to the Upper Midwest Agricultural Safety and Health Center (U54OH010170), the Central States Center for Agricultural Safety and Health (U54 OH010162), and the Great Plains Center for Agricultural Health (U54 OH007548).  aPublisher supplied data  aU54OH007548aU54OH010162 and U54OH010170 3aInternet 3aagricultural health and safety 3aagromedicine 3acurriculum 3afarms 3ahealth information 3ahumans 3aradio 3astakeholders 3astatistics 3aworking conditions 3aMidwestern United States 0aAgricultural safety 0ainjury 0ahealth 0anarrative 0astorytelling1 aDuysen, Ellen1 aHeiberger, Scott1 aYoder, Aaron1 aLeonard, Stephanie0 tJournal of agromedicine.g2020 July 02, v. 25, no. 3 p.249-250dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl51337x1545-08137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1059924X.2020.17655763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02786naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001700144245010000161300002000261500001900281520130200300592002801602650001701630650002201647650001901669650001501688650001901703650001201722653002301734653001301757653001201770653001401782700002301796700001701819700006201836700002101898700001901919700002701938700002301965700002101988700001902009700005902028773014202087856007802229852000902307655001202316IND60711366120210831000000.0200923e20200826xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071136612DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.0c105792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Binbin10aIntegration of Single Oriented Oxide Superlattices on Silicon Using Various Template Techniques  ap. 42925-42932.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aTo benefit from the diverse functionalities of perovskite oxides in silicon-based complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology, integrating oxides into a silicon platform has become one of the major tasks for oxide research. Using the deposition of LaMnO₃/SrTiO₃ (STO) superlattices (SLs) as a case study, we demonstrate that (001) single oriented oxide SLs can be integrated on Si using various template techniques, including a single-layer buffer of STO prepared by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) and pulsed laser deposition, a multilayer buffer of Y-stabilized zirconia/CeO₂/LaNiO₃/STO, and STO-coated two-dimensional nanosheets of Ca₂Nb₃O₁₀ (CNO) and reduced graphene oxide. The textured SL grown on STO-coated CNO nanosheets shows the highest crystallinity, owing to the small lattice mismatch between CNO and STO as well as less clamping from a Si substrate. The epitaxial SL grown on STO buffer prepared by MBE suffers the largest thermal strain, giving rise to a strongly suppressed saturation magnetization but an enhanced coercive field, as compared to the reference SL grown on an STO single crystal. These optional template techniques used for integrating oxides on Si are of significance to fulfill practical applications of oxide films in different fields.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3acrystal structure 3agraphene oxide 3ananosheets 3asemiconductors 3asilicon 0aoxide superlattice 0atemplate 0aepitaxy 0amagnetism1 aJovanović, Zoran,1 aAbel, Stefan1 aLe, Phu Tran Phong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1791-71841 aHalisdemir, Ufuk1 aSmithers, Mark1 aDiaz-Fernandez, Daniel1 aSpreitzer, Matjaž1 aFompeyrine, Jean1 aRijnders, Guus1 aKoster, Gertjan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5478-73290 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2020 Aug. 26, v. 12, no. 38 p.42925-42932dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c105793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02987naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100003400139245012300173300001800296500002000314520139800334592002801732596003001760650003001790650002501820650001301845650001601858650002701874650001801901650001901919650001601938650001601954650001301970650001601983650001101999650001402010650001202024650003102036650002102067700006802088700002502156700001702181700003102198700002502229700002302254773012202277856007302399852000902472655001202481IND60694350620221122231201.0200513e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069435062DNAL7 a10.1111/are.146012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReshma, Kalarical Janardhanan10aIndexing serum biochemical attributes of Lutjanus argentimaculatus (Forsskal, 1775) to instrument in health assessment  ap. 2590-2602.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe present study was aimed to establish reference data for nine serum biochemical attributes (glucose, protein, albumin, globulin, albumin/globulin ratio, cholesterol, triglycerides, serum glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase [SGOT] and serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase [SGPT]) of a supreme aquaculture candidate, namely Lutjanus argentimaculatus. Further, the influence of ecotype (cage–wild), condition index and gender on biochemical attributes was evaluated. The results have shown that gender and condition index had no significant effect in the studied age group, whereas ecotype had a significant role, except on serum glucose levels, suggesting the prime importance of estimating ecotype‐specific reference intervals for interpreting fish health. Intra‐ecotype variability of serum biochemical attributes, namely serum protein, globulin, cholesterol and triglycerides, was less, suggesting the possibility of using these parameters as health indices within a specific ecotype. Consistency in terms of the least intra‐ecotype variability coupled with PCA results points serum protein as the best ecotype‐specific health index among the different parameters studied. Altogether, the results of the present study provide thought‐provoking insights on serum biochemistry of L. argentimaculatus as a platform for the health management of this supreme aquaculture candidate.  aPublisher supplied data  aMBTD/HLT/23cICAR‐CMFRI 3aLutjanus argentimaculatus 3aalanine transaminase 3aalbumins 3aaquaculture 3aaspartate transaminase 3ablood glucose 3ablood proteins 3ablood serum 3acholesterol 3aecotypes 3afish health 3agender 3aglobulins 3aglucose 3ahealth effects assessments 3atriacylglycerols1 aSumithra, Thangalazhy G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9794-67721 aVishnu, Balachandran1 aJyothi, Raju1 aRatheesh Kumar, Raveendran1 aPootholathil, Sayooj1 aSanil, Nandiath K.0 tAquaculture research.g2020 June, v. 51, no. 6 p.2590-2602dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl53865x1355-557X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/are.146013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03019naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100005700140245010000197500001900297500002000316520201800336592002802354650001302382650001402395650001002409650001202419650001502431700001702446700002402463773013502487856007402622852000902696655001202705IND60729902820221122051049.0210304e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072990282DNAL7 a10.1111/jfpe.136382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVarghese, Abi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2272-718510aDesign, development and testing of an auger‐assisted semi‐automatic coconut husking machine  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aCoconut husking is the primary and most difficult post‐harvesting operation among coconut processing. The physical properties of the coconuts such as length, diameter, perimeter, weight and husk thickness at the apex, at the pedicel end, at the ¼ from pedicel end, at the ½ from the pedicel end and at the ¾ from the pedicel end and the husk‐separating‐forces are calculated to design machine components. A prototype of an auger‐assisted semi‐automatic coconut husking machine (ASCHM) have designed, constructed, tested and its husking rate, husking effectiveness, husking efficiency, percent of nut breaking, and capacity of the machine has evaluated. The machine comprises mainly of a pair of upright blades; held juxtaposed for manual impaling, and an electrically‐driven auger. The mean time required for complete husking of green coconut and dry coconut have been found to be 12.6 s and 13.6 s respectively. The husking efficiency of ASCHM was found as 100% with no nut breaking with a capacity of 242 nuts/hr for green coconuts and 229 nuts/hr for dry coconuts. Further, performance of the developed tool has been compared with that of CPCH and KAU coconut husking tool. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Main contribution of this work is to design, development and testing of a semi‐automatic coconut husking machine and to analyze the performance of the same in terms of husking rate, husking effectiveness, husking efficiency, and percentage of nut breaking and capacity of the machine was evaluated. The results are then compared with those obtained for a manual and fully automated husking machine as well. Husk separating force calculation have been done considering the relevant physical properties of the coconut like size, shape, weight, and so forth. The observations are further then used for the design of machine components and the selection of a power source. The information deduced can be used as a database for future modifications as well as development of coconut husking machines.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoconuts 3adatabases 3ahulls 3apedicel 3aprototypes1 aJacob, Jippu1 aRajan, Abraham Iype0 tJournal of food process engineering.g2021 Mar., v. 44, no. 3 p.e13638-dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl8651x0145-88767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfpe.136383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02980naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245010300169300001800272520142000290592002801710596004801738596004901786596004201835650002201877650001201899650001401911650002501925650001001950650001101960650001901971650001701990650002102007650001702028650001202045650001802057650001602075650002402091650001402115700005902129700001702188700001902205700003402224700002602258773011102284856008202395852000902477655001202486IND60636357120221120085143.0190408e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063635712DNAL7 a10.1007/s10570-019-02271-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmran, Umar Adli10aPolyols and rigid polyurethane foams derived from liquefied lignocellulosic and cellulosic biomass  ap. 3231-3246.  aLiquefaction of lignocellulosic and cellulosic biomasses produces different polyol properties. Hence, direct comparative studies on the properties of both biomass liquefaction-derived polyols and polyurethane foams (PUFs) have been extensively performed. Optimization of oil palm empty fruit bunch fiber (EFB) and EFB-based cellulose (EFBC) liquefactions was performed in cosolvent polyethylene glycol–glycerol to produce polyols. Hydroxyl (OH) and acid numbers, viscosity, molecular weight, and chemical functionalities of the polyols were analyzed and compared. The optimum liquefaction temperature for both EFB and EFBC was 175 °C. However, the optimum liquefaction time of EFBC (180 min) was longer than the time recorded by EFB (90 min). Liquefaction temperature and time had influenced degradation and recondensation of liquefied biomass products, hence affected the properties of polyols. Extreme degradation and recondensation during liquefaction had reduced the OH number of polyols. Recondensation significantly affected the molecular weight and viscosity of the EFB polyol, but not those of EFBC polyol. Rigid PUFs synthesized from the optimum EFB and EFBC polyols were denoted as EFB PUF and EFBC PUF, respectively. EFB PUF possessed larger average cell diameter than that of EFBC PUF. Comparatively, the thermal decomposition and compressive strength of EFB PUF were lower than those of EFBC PUF.  aPublisher supplied data  aAP-2015-005cUniversiti Kebangsaan Malaysia  aDIP-2016-004cUniversiti Kebangsaan Malaysia  aRDU160329cUniversiti Malaysia Pahang 3aElaeis guineensis 3abiomass 3acellulose 3acompression strength 3afoams 3afruits 3alignocellulose 3aliquefaction 3amolecular weight 3apolyethylene 3apolyols 3apolyurethanes 3atemperature 3athermal degradation 3aviscosity1 aZakaria, Sarani1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5981-09861 aJia, Jinhua,1 aRoslan, Rasidi1 aJaafar, Sharifah Nabihah Syed1 aSalleh, Kushairi Mohd0 tCellulose.g2019 Mar., v. 26, no. 5 p.3231-3246dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3871471x0969-02397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10570-019-02271-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02901naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245011300168300001600281520161700297592002801914650001401942650001801956650001101974650002001985650000902005650000702014650001902021653001702040653002102057653002202078653001602100653001802116700001702134700002702151700001902178700001802197700001702215773015302232856008502385852000902470655001202479IND60642336220221121032202.0190507e20190316xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064233622DNAL7 a10.1080/03067319.2019.15962672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCubuk, Osman10aVoltammetric detection of chlorite ion using carbon paste sensor modified with N-cetylpyridinium–bentonite  ap. 343-356.  aA voltammetric carbon paste sensor (CPS) was described for the detection of chlorite ion in water analysis. For the construction of the voltammetric CPS, organo-bentonites were synthesised by intercalation of N-cetylpyridinium (NCP) at different amounts into interlayer gap of bentonite. Some features of the obtained organo-bentonites such as structural, thermal and morphological were investigated by using various techniques. Afterwards, the voltammetric behaviour of the solution was investigated with cyclic voltammetry in the potential range of 0.0–1.0 V at a scan rate of 50 mV s⁻¹ based on the obtained organo-bentonites as electroactive material. The characterisation of the prepared organo-bentonites as electroactive material, the effect of the amount of NCP–bentonite (NCP–B) in modified CPS on the 10.0 mM response was tested by chancing the percentage of NCP–B in the range of 2.50–12.50% under identical experimental conditions. The pH of the measurement cell was optimised by using 0.04 M Britton–Robinson buffer in the range of pH 2.0–12.0. Under the optimised conditions, developed sensor exhibited a linear response in the range of 2.0 × 10⁻⁵ to 2.0 × 10⁻⁴ M chlorite ions concentrations. The detection limit and the limit of quantification were figured out as 6.0 × 10⁻⁶ and 2.0 × 10⁻⁵ M, respectively. The repeatability and reproducibility of the sensor were calculated as 5.0% and 6.8% (N = 5), respectively. Finally, the sensor was successfully applied for the analysis of bottled water, and the mean recovery was found as 103 ± 3%.  aPublisher supplied data 3abentonite 3abottled water 3acarbon 3adetection limit 3aions 3apH 3awater analysis 0aChlorite ion 0aorgano-bentonite 0aN-cetylpyridinium 0avoltammetry 0aintercalation1 aColak, Isıl1 aÖzdokur, Kemal Volkan1 aCaglar, Bulent1 aColdur, Fatih1 aTopcu, Cihan0 tInternational journal of environmental analytical chemistry.g2019 Mar. 16, v. 99, no. 4 p.343-356dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12218x1029-03977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03067319.2019.15962673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02053naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002300138245009400161300001600255520101400271592002801285653001201313653001601325653001201341653001401353653001701367700001601384700001901400700001801419700002101437700002101458773015501479856007201634852000901706655001201715IND60131672620221119193616.0151127e200612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013167262DNAL7 a10.1638/06-050.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChatfield, Jenifer10aResolution of a hyperprolactinemia in a western lowland gorilla (gorilla gorilla gorilla)  ap. 565-566.  aProlactin-secreting pituitary adenomas are one of the most common causes of infertility in women. Prolactin plays an important role in lactation and is involved in producing some of the normal mammalian breeding and maternal behaviors. Elevated serum prolactin concentrations can adversely affect the reproductive cycle in females by inhibiting the normal lutenizing hormone surge that stimulates ovulation. A 17-year-old western lowland gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) presented with low fertility and hyperprolactinemia. An MRI confirmed a pituitary mass and treatment was initiated with cabergoline. Following 8 mo of treatment, mass size decreased and serum prolactin was within normal limits. The gorilla began to engage in normal breeding behavior, and within 6 mo of completing treatment, was pregnant. Hyperprolactinemia, secondary to presumed microprolactinoma, may be more common among breeding-age gorillas than is currently diagnosed and in humans is an easily diagnosed and treatable condition.  aPublisher supplied data 0aadenoma 0acabergoline 0agorilla 0aprolactin 0areproduction1 aZhang, Lily1 aRamey, Jacques1 aBowsher, Todd1 aLoskutoff, Naida1 aO'Neill, Kortney0 tJournal of zoo and wildlife medicine.g2006 Dec., v. 37, no. 4 p.565-566dAmerican Association of Zoo VeterinarianswJournal:jnl43569x1937-28257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1638/06-050.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02324naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245012100166300001800287520131700305592002801622650001101650650003501661650001101696650001401707650001301721650001501734651001001749700001701759700001501776773011701791856008101908852000901989655001201998IND60440630320221119180920.0151024e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044063032DNAL7 a10.1007/s12665-015-4525-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChang, Zhiyang10aAssessment of the relative tectonic activity in the Bailongjiang Basin: insights from DEM-derived geomorphic indices  ap. 5143-5153.  aThe Bailongjiang drainage basin is located in the transition zone between the Tibetan Plateau and the Loess Plateau. Active tectonic records demonstrate the interplay between the Tibetan Plateau uplift and the different movement of the faults. To assess the relative tectonic activities in this area, five geomorphic indices derived through geographic information system were analyzed: the stream-gradient index (SL), hypsometric integral (HI), valley floor width–valley height ratio (VF), drainage basin shape, and drainage basin asymmetry (AF). Active faults, seismogenic activity, and river terraces were also integrated into this investigation. The results indicate that four classes of relative tectonic activity were defined: Class 1 (very high relative tectonic activity, 5.5 % in the area); Class 2 (high, 54 %); Class 3 (moderate, 24.1 %), and Class 4 (low, 16.4 %). Sub-basins at the midstream and upstream of Bailongjiang show abnormally high SL, high HI, AF, and convex hypsometric curves and low VF values due to the impact of the east-ward extrusion of the Tibetan plateau and active faults. The downstream shows low SL, HI, and AF and concave hypsometric curves due to the low tectonic activity of the faults inhibited by Minshan. These results are consistent with the geological background.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3ageographic information systems 3arivers 3atectonics 3aterraces 3awatersheds 3aChina1 aSun, Weihong1 aWang, Jian0 tEnvironmental earth sciences.g2015 Sept., v. 74, no. 6 p.5143-5153dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1866-62807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-015-4525-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03397naa a2200709 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245011200170300001600282520142800298592002801726650002001754650002201774650002501796650001901821650002501840650001701865650001101882650001901893650003701912650003501949650001101984650002401995650001402019650001902033650001902052650001402071650001502085651001002100653000902110653000802119653000802127653001002135653000802145653000802153653000802161653000802169653000902177653000902186653000802195653001502203653004002218653002402258653002902282653002602311653002502337700001302362700001802375700001802393700001202411700001602423700001802439700001502457773010802472856008602580852000902666655001202675IND60533306620221120233822.0190319e20140507xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053330662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2014.03.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Yongliang10aVirus-induced gene silencing in two novel functional plants, Lycium barbarum L. and Lycium ruthenicum Murr.  ap. 267-274.  aTwo species of Goji, Lycium barbarum L. and Lycium ruthenicum Murr., are novel functional vegetables and functional fruits widely used in China and other Asian countries. Both species possess complex secondary metabolic pathways and show high tolerance and adaptability to saline-alkali stress, making them novel targets for functional genetic analysis of the biochemical pathways involved. Although stable transgenic Goji lines have been produced, the process is very labor-intensive and time-consuming. Virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) presents an effective and rapid alternative for creating targeted gene knock-outs to study gene function in plants. In this study, the first application of VIGS in Lycium species is presented, using the Tobacco rattle virus (TRV) vectors. A number of vector delivery methods were trialed, including leaf syringe-infiltration, agrodrench, seedling vacuum-infiltration and sprout vacuum-infiltration (SVI). Vacuum-infiltration was the most effective method and was used to successfully silence two reporter genes, phytoene desaturase (PDS) and Mg-chelatase H subunit (Chl H), concomitant with photobleaching and yellow leaf phenotypes, respectively. The proven application of VIGS to these Lycium sp. will expedite the functional characterization of novel genes involved in the biosynthesis of functional components both in leaves and fruits, as well as the abiotic stress tolerances.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLycium barbarum 3aLycium ruthenicum 3aTobacco rattle virus 3aabiotic stress 3abiochemical pathways 3abiosynthesis 3afruits 3agene silencing 3agenetic techniques and protocols 3agenetically modified organisms 3aleaves 3amagnesium chelatase 3aphenotype 3aphotobleaching 3areporter genes 3aseedlings 3avegetables 3aChina 0aVIGS 0aTRV 0aPDS 0aChl H 0aSVI 0aTCM 0aLBP 0aEST 0aPTGS 0aRISC 0aGOI 0aLycium sp. 0aVirus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) 0aVacuum infiltration 0aAbiotic stress tolerance 0aSecondary metabolites 0aTraditional medicine1 aSun, Wei1 aZeng, Shaohua1 aHuang, Wenjun1 aLiu, Di1 aHu, Weiming1 aShen, Xiaofei1 aWang, Ying0 tScientia horticulturae.g2014 May 07, v. 170 p.267-274dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4108x0304-42387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2014.03.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03066naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245007100168300001800239500001100257520152800268592002801796596007101824650002801895650001201923650001601935650001801951650001501969650001401984650002201998650001802020650002602038650001202064650001702076650002202093650002202115650001902137650000902156650001802165650001902183650001902202650001302221650002102234700001802255700001602273700005702289773011102346856008202457852000902539655001202548IND60636357420221122065509.0190408e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063635742DNAL7 a10.1007/s10570-019-02307-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHussain, Zohaib10aProduction of bacterial cellulose from industrial wastes: a review  ap. 2895-2911.  aReview  aEconomic, social and environmental factors have led many industries to find new and attractive ways of waste management. Clean biotechnology is an integrated platform for the conversion of wastes into valuable and less toxic end products. Bacterial cellulose (BC) has a long history of its use as an important biomaterial for various applications. However, the potential for its industrialization and commercialization at large scale is still a challenge due to high fermentation cost, low productivity and expensive culture media. To overcome this problem, low-cost substrates and large waste biomass byproducts of various industries have been evaluated for BC production. Of these, tons of wastes produced from the agro, food, brewery and sugar industries, lignocellulosic biorefineries, textile and pulp mills are ideal raw materials for BC production. Recently, various studies have reported the wastes from these industries as a source of various nutrient for the low cost production of BC. This review is centered on BC production from low cost substrates with a major focus on the wastes from agro, food, brewery, sugar industries, lignocellulosic biorefineries, textile and pulp mills. Moreover, recent research trends and commercial media available for BC production are also discussed. This review also discuss briefly the properties and applications of BC. This article would likely draw the attention of researchers towards utilization of industrial wastes as potential alternate media for the production of BC.  aPublisher supplied data  a16-27/CRGP/CIIT/ATD/16/1125cCOMSATS Research Grant Program (CRGP) 3abiocompatible materials 3abiomass 3abiorefining 3abiotechnology 3abyproducts 3acellulose 3acommercialization 3aculture media 3aenvironmental factors 3afabrics 3afermentation 3aindustrial wastes 3aindustrialization 3alignocellulose 3apulp 3araw materials 3asocial factors 3asugar industry 3atoxicity 3awaste management1 aSajjad, Wasim1 aKhan, Taous1 aFazl-i-Wahid,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8133-60610 tCellulose.g2019 Mar., v. 26, no. 5 p.2895-2911dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3871471x0969-02397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10570-019-02307-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02731naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094024002200134024001900156040001800175100001700193245019100210300001600401506007600417520104900493592002801542506003701570650002101607650001701628650001001645650002501655650004301680650001101723650002201734650001801756650003301774650001101807653002101818653001901839653003001858653003301888653003501921700001501956700001401971700001901985700002302004773011402027856008702141852000902228655001202237IND60542212220221207083530.0190402e20140701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054221222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2014.01.0092doi7 aPMC39598912pmcid7 a245183412pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, Yingjian10aCharacterisation of organic and conventional sweet basil leaves using chromatographic and flow-injection mass spectrometric (FIMS) fingerprints combined with principal component analysis  ap. 262-268.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSweet basil, Ocimum basilicum, is one of the most important and wildly used spices and has been shown to have antioxidant, antibacterial, and anti-diarrheal activities. In this study, high performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) and flow-injection mass spectrometric (FIMS) fingerprinting techniques were used to differentiate organic and conventional sweet basil leaf samples. Principal component analysis (PCA) of the fingerprints indicated that both HPLC and FIMS fingerprints could effectively detect the chemical differences in the organic and conventional sweet basil leaf samples. This study suggested that the organic basil sample contained greater concentrations of almost all the major compounds than its conventional counterpart on a per same botanical weight basis. The FIMS method was able to rapidly differentiate the organic and conventional sweet basil leaf samples (1min analysis time), whereas the HPLC fingerprints provided more information about the chemical composition of the basil samples with a longer analytical time.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aOcimum basilicum 3aantioxidants 3abasil 3achemical composition 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aleaves 3amass spectrometry 3aorganic foods 3aprincipal component analysis 3aspices 0aHPLC fingerprint 0aFlow injection 0aMass spectral fingerprint 0aPrincipal component analysis 0aSweet basil (Ocimum basilicum)1 aGao, Boyan1 aChen, Pei1 aCharles, Denys1 aYu, Liangli (Lucy)0 tFood chemistry.g2014 July 01, v. 154 p.262-268dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2014.01.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02738naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245006800164300001800232520125000250592002801500650002501528650001901553650002001572650001101592650001801603650002601621650001601647650001601663650001601679650001501695653002901710653002601739653003601765653003201801653002501833700001701858700001501875700001701890700001601907700001901923700001701942700005701959773014802016856008302164852000902247655001202256IND60612853720221121064458.0201202e20180101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061285372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2017.11.1552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJo, Sungsin10aIdentification and characterization of human bone-derived cells  ap. 1257-1263.  aThis study was designed to identify and characterize primary bone-derived cells (BdCs) and investigate the potential role of osteoblast differentiation. Primary BdCs were isolated from surgical bone for comparative analysis with mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and fetal osteoblasts (FOBs) and for potential differentiation to mature osteoblasts. Using three different cells, we successfully cultivated human osteoblast differentiation and activity which were evaluated using microarray and biochemical methods. BdCs are more correlated to MSCs in bioinformatics result and similar with FOBs in gene expression. In particular, Osterix, osteoprogenitor marker, was high expressed in BdCs, while the expression in MSCs and FOBs were very low. Furthermore, BdCs exhibited a marked alkaline phosphatase (ALP) expression, early stage of osteogenic marker, and retained osteogenic properties and physiological changes into maturation as in FOBs. BdCs also showed an increase in bone morphogenic protein 2 (BMP2), osteopontin (OPN), and osteocalcin (OCN) mRNA expressions during differentiation. This study suggests that BdCs may be osteoprogenitor cells or undifferentiated preosteoblasts with strong capacity to differentiate toward mature osteoblasts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkaline phosphatase 3abioinformatics 3agene expression 3ahumans 3amessenger RNA 3amicroarray technology 3aosteoblasts 3aosteocalcin 3aosteopontin 3astem cells 0aHuman bone-derived cells 0aOsteoprogenitor cells 0aUndifferentiated preosteoblasts 0aOsteoblasts differentiation 0aOsteoblasts activity1 aLee, Jin Kyu1 aHan, Jinil1 aLee, Bitnara1 aKang, Suman1 aHwang, Kyu-Tae1 aPark, Ye-Soo1 aKim, Tae-Hwan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3542-22760 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2018 Jan. 01, v. 495, no. 1 p.1257-1263dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2017.11.1553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02348naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245008700172300001600259520101700275592002801292650003501320650001501355650002301370650002001393650002101413650001501434650001701449650000901466650002401475650001501499650001101514650001301525653002501538653001601563653002601579653002301605700002101628700001801649773015301667856008501820852000901905655001201914IND60642336520221121032158.0190507e20190316xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064233652DNAL7 a10.1080/03067319.2019.15998742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAravind, Archana10aUnmodified silver nanoparticles based multisensor for Ni (II) ions in real samples  ap. 380-395.  aThis article report microwave assisted green method for the synthesis of silver nanoparticle from Brassica oleracea var.

The third one is the electrochemical sensing of Ni (II) ion in which silver nanoparticle attached to the platinum electrode surface. The above-mentioned methods exhibit outstanding selectivity towards Ni (II) ion. The practical application of the AgNP-BI was also carried out for the trace determination of Ni (II) ions.

However, its production from whey must have a high yield and low cost for industrial applications. As such, this study reports the use of polyacrylamide cryogel, loaded with Cu2+ (through the bond with iminodiacetic acid (IDA)), as an adsorbent for the chromatographic process to capture lactoferrin whey. Ultrafiltered cheese whey was passed through the cryogel-IDA-Cu2+ system. The eluates were subjected to analysis of total protein, SDS–PAGE and size exclusion chromatography. The results showed an axial dispersion coefficients, at different superficial velocities of liquid, in a range of 10–6–10–5m2/s. The cryogel demonstrated good hydraulic permeability (4.7086×10–13m2) and a porosity of approximately 78.2%.

Although the hydrology in flood pulsed systems is often theorized to drive fish population dynamics, in the Okavango Delta there are no monitoring or modeling studies that quantify this complex ecological relationship. The objective of this work was to produce and analyze a mechanistic fish population model of the Okavango Delta that is driven by the annual flood pulse in order to corroborate the theory that Delta fish populations are driven by the flood signal. The model tracked age cohorts over time with density dependant recruitment, mortality, and vulnerability components. Global sensitivity analysis identified the parameters that were the most important in determining the model outcome. Monte Carlo filtering truncated prior parameter probability density functions and refined model uncertainty. One of the unique outcomes of this research was the identification of polishing parameters, i.e. model parameters that are essential in obtaining optimal model performance by matching output variability, though they are not important in changing the magnitude of model results. The flood coefficient (a scaling factor that describes how recruitment changes with the magnitude of the flood) was shown to be a polishing parameter, providing quantitative evidence that floods are a driver of fish population dynamics in the Delta. This linkage between the flood pulse and fish population dynamics provides quantitative information that is necessary for making informed decisions regarding the management of hydrologic and ecological resources in the Okavango Delta.  aPublisher supplied data 3amodels 3afloods 3amodel validation 3amodel uncertainty 3afish 3amortality 3aBotswana 0arecruitment1 aMuÃ±oz-Carpena, Rafael1 aAllen, Micheal S.1 aKiker, Gregory1 aMosepele, Ketlhatlogile0 tEcological modelling.g2012 Mar. 10, v. 228 p.27-38dElsevier B.V.x0304-38007nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2011.12.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02549naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001800144245010600162300002000268500001900288520113100307592002801438650001701466650001601483650001301499650001701512653001501529653002601544653001401570653001501584700001501599700001501614700001601629700001901645700001401664700001701678700001201695700005501707700005501762700005701817773014201874856007802016852000902094655001202103IND60711366520221122053309.0200923e20200827xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071136652DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.0c108692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Xiao-Fei10aFluorescence Lifetime-Tunable Water-Resistant Perovskite Quantum Dots for Multidimensional Encryption  ap. 43073-43082.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aUsing temporal dimension in optical multiplexing is a promising method to increase the security of data encryption. However, adjusting the fluorescence lifetime of light-emitting material often results in inevitable changes in their fluorescence spectra, which is unfavorable for confidential information protection. Here, we report the preparation of various perovskite quantum dot/polymer nanospheres (PQD/polymer) with tunable and long fluorescence lifetimes but identical fluorescence spectra, which are ideal multidimensional data encryption materials. This new data encryption strategy utilizes the water sensitivity of perovskite and achieves spatial dimension encryption of information using different water stabilities between uncoated perovskite quantum dots and PQD/polymer. The fluorescence lifetime of PQD/polymer is used as the coding element to achieve temporal dimension data encryption, and the data are decrypted by fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy and time-gated luminescence imaging techniques. This study shows the potential of PQD/polymer as a new class of materials for advanced data encryption.  aPublisher supplied data 3afluorescence 3ananospheres 3apolymers 3aquantum dots 0aperovskite 0afluorescence lifetime 0astability 0aencryption1 aZou, Liang1 aYang, Chen1 aZhao, Weili1 aLi, Xiangyang,1 aSun, Bing1 aHu, Chen-Xia1 aYu, Yue1 aWang, Qiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4008-51441 aZhao, Qiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3788-47571 aZhang, Hao-Li1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6322-52020 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2020 Aug. 27, v. 12, no. 38 p.43073-43082dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c108693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02558naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245015300172300001600325520118100341592002801522650001501550650002401565650001301589650001501602650002101617650001901638650001801657650001201675650001301687650002501700650001301725650001901738650002101757653002201778653002801800653002101828700001901849700002101868773014001889856008602029852000902115655001202124IND60792058220221121222518.0220905e20220703xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079205822DNAL7 a10.2989/10220119.2021.19314462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHughes, Martin P10aLow nitrogen fertiliser rates and stage of maturity influence nitrogen fractionation and in vitro ruminal nitrogen degradability in tropical grasses  ap. 292-297.  aThis study evaluated the interactive effects of low rates (0, 25, 50 and 75 kg N ha⁻¹) of nitrogen (N) fertilizer application and stage of maturity on total N, N fractions and in vitro ruminal N degradability in Brachiaria hybrid, Megathyrsus maximus and Paspalum atratum. The grasses were harvested at 4, 8 and 12 weeks regrowth, except for P. atratum that was harvested at 6 and 12 weeks. There was a significant N fertilizer rate × stage of maturity interaction (p < 0.001) on total N, buffer soluble N (BSN), buffer insoluble N (BISN), acid detergent insoluble N (ADIN) and in vitro ruminal N degradability (ND) in all grass species. Total N, BISN and in vitro ruminal N degradability increased linearly with N fertilizer rate up to 50 kg ha⁻¹ in Brachiaria hybrid and M. maximus and were highest in grasses harvested at 4 weeks maturity. Nitrogen fertilization rate was positively correlated with total N, BISN (r = 0.70 to 0.97) and ND (r = 0.60 to 0.98) in Brachiaria hybrid and M. maximus forage. We concluded that N fertilisation rate of 50 kg ha⁻¹ per application interval is adequate to improve N, N fractions and N degradability of tropical grass forage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrachiaria 3aMegathyrsus maximus 3aPaspalum 3adetergents 3afertilizer rates 3aforage grasses 3afractionation 3ahybrids 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fertilizers 3aregrowth 3atotal nitrogen 3atropical grasses 0aBrachiaria hybrid 0abuffer soluble nitrogen 0aPaspalum atratum1 aMlambo, Victor1 aLallo, Cicero HO0 tAfrican journal of range & forage science.g2022 July 03, v. 39, no. 3 p.292-297dTaylor & FranciswJournal:J000000042x1727-93807nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2989/10220119.2021.19314463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02983naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006300139245015100202300001800353500002000371520140800391592002801799596010601827596003701933650001701970650002001987650001602007650001402023650000902037650002002046650001102066650001402077650001202091650001802103700001902121700002402140700003002164700006002194700002002254700002502274700002202299773012202321856007302443852000902516655001202525IND60694351220221122234722.0200513e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069435122DNAL7 a10.1111/are.145862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRahman, Md.

The present study was, therefore, conducted following a half‐sib breeding design to test the effects of (a) paternal body size, (b) offspring feeding strategy (everyday and every other day) and (c) their interactions on fitness‐related traits (e.g., survival, total length and body area) of offspring of a commercially important aquaculture species, the Indian major carp (Labeo rohita). The analysis revealed that paternal body size had significant effects on offspring survival rate and total length, while no significant influence was found in body area. The study also showed that the offspring feeding strategy significantly affected all offspring traits. Interestingly, the study unveiled the significant interactive effects of paternal condition and offspring feeding for offspring survival rate and total length. These findings suggest that paternal size, offspring rearing environment and their interactions can influence offspring fitness‐related traits which are very essential information for the sustainable production of good quality larvae under variable dietary conditions.  aPublisher supplied data  aLS2016107cMinistry of Education, Bangladesh Bureau of Educational Information & Statistics (BANBEIS)  aLS2016107cMinistry of Education 3aLabeo rohita 3aanimal breeding 3aaquaculture 3abody size 3acarp 3afeeding methods 3alarvae 3aphenotype 3aprogeny 3asurvival rate1 aSiddique, Asif1 aRahman, Md.

Samples were collected in pre-monsoon (April–June), monsoon (July–August) and post-monsoon (October–November) seasons in 2007. Laboratory analysis of samples revealed inter-seasonal variability, primarily attributed to hydrogeochemical processes. All or most of the samples exceeded the World Health Organization (WHO) guideline value (GLV) for iron, conductivity and turbidity, while none of the samples exceeded WHO GLV for hardness and arsenic with minor fraction exceeding GLV for chloride content. Higher ammonia content in well water and highest phosphate concentration occurred for stone spout in pre-monsoon season. Principle component analysis highlighted three principle components while the dendrogram divided the sampling sites into four and two clusters, respectively, for well water and stone spout water sampling sites. Saturation index computed through WATEQ4F model revealed that ferrihydrite, siderite, strengite and vivianite minerals were in under-saturated state, while goethite was in supersaturated condition for each type of samples (well water and stone spout water) in both pre- and post-monsoon seasons depicting their tendency to precipitate. High degree of supersaturation in goethite mineral indicated response to temperature gradient of the reactions, while under-saturation for other minerals indicated the effect of dilution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWorld Health Organization 3aammonia 3aarsenic 3aferrihydrite 3agoethite 3agroundwater 3aguidelines 3ahardness 3airon 3amodels 3amonsoon season 3aprincipal component analysis 3asampling 3asiderite 3atemperature 3aturbidity 3aNepal1 aDiwakar, Jasmine1 aSingh, Sudhir Kumar0 tEnvironmental earth sciences.g2015 Sept., v. 74, no. 6 p.4973-4988dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1866-62807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-015-4514-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02921naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245020500170300001600375520133900391592002801730650001301758650002101771650002601792650002501818650001701843650001201860650001201872650001201884650001401896650001101910650001401921650001201935650003201947650002001979650001201999650001102011650001602022650001202038653002602050653001402076653001402090653001002104653001202114700001602126700002102142700002402163773010902187856008602296852000902382655001202391IND60533307020221120090721.0190319e20140609xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053330702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2014.03.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBharathi, L.K.10aCharacterization of a fertile backcross progeny derived from inter-specific hybrid of Momordica dioica and M. subangulata subsp. renigera and its implications on improvement of dioecious Momordica spp  ap. 143-148.  aA fertile female backcross progeny was produced from an inter-specific hybrid [teasel gourd (Momordica subangulata Blume subsp. renigera (G. Don) WJJ de Wilde)×spine gourd (Momordica dioica Roxb)] by backcrossing the F1 with the female parent. Agro morphological and biochemical traits of the first generation backcross (F1 ♀ BC) confirmed interchanges of genetic material. The F1 ♀ BC bear more resemblance to maternal parent than the paternal parent and exhibited substantial heterosis for number of flowers and yield per plant. In F1 ♀ BC, fruit set was significantly higher when pollinated with teasel gourd (84%) while the fruit set was very low upon sibbing (36%) and pollination with spine gourd (64%). The fruits of F1 ♀ BC had little variation for shape from teasel gourd when pollinated with teasel gourd pollen, while fruits obtained from sibbing and dusting of spine gourd pollen were deformed and smaller in size. The proximate and phytochemical analysis revealed that the F1 ♀ BC was intermediate between the original parents in its biochemical traits and antioxidant activity while mineral content was found to be higher or similar to its parents. The present study shows the potential for improving Momordica species through inter-specific hybridization followed by restoration of fertility by backcrossing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDipsacus 3aMomordica dioica 3aMomordica subangulata 3aantioxidant activity 3abackcrossing 3adusting 3afemales 3aflowers 3afruit set 3afruits 3aheterosis 3ahybrids 3ainterspecific hybridization 3amineral content 3aparents 3apollen 3apollination 3aprogeny 0aInter-specific hybrid 0aMomordica 0aBackcross 0aYield 0aQuality1 aSingh, H.S.1 aShivashankar, S.1 aGaneshamurthy, A.N.0 tScientia horticulturae.g2014 June 09, v. 172 p.143-148dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4108x0304-42387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2014.03.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03066naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006100139245016400200300001600364500001900380500002000399520168400419592002802103650002002131650002302151650001502174650001602189650001102205650001502216650003402231650001802265650001702283650001402300650002402314650001002338700002302348700002202371700001802393700002402411773011502435856007302550852000902623655001202632IND60729903520221122070135.0210304e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072990352DNAL7 a10.1111/age.130382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSeifi Moroudi, R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0886-064910aIdentification of new genes and quantitative trait locis associated with growth curve parameters in F2 chicken population using genome‐wide association study  ap. 171-184.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe markers which are correlated with the growth curve parameters help in understanding the characteristics of individual growth during the rearing of livestock. This study aimed to identify a set of biomarkers through a GWAS for growth curve parameters in crossbred chickens using the Illumnia 60K chicken SNP Beadchip. Growth data were collected from a total of 301 birds from cross of a broiler line and native chickens. Using the Gompertz–Laird model, two growth curve parameters, the instantaneous growth rate per day (L) and the coefficient of relative growth or maturing index (k), were estimated. The L and k were used to estimate five derived parameters, namely asymptotic (mature) body weight, body weight at inflection point, age at the inflection point, average growth rate and maximum growth rate. These parameters were considered as phenotypic values in the GWAS based on generalized linear models. The results of the GWAS indicated 21 significant markers, which were located near or within 46 genes. A number of these genes, such as GH, RET, GRB14, FTSJ3 and CCK, are important for growth and meat quality in chickens, and some of them are growth related in other species such as sheep and cattle (GPI, XIRP2, GALNTL6, BMS1, THSD4, TRHDE, SHISA9, ACSL6 and DYNC1LI2). The other genes are associated with developmental biological pathways. These genes are particuarly related to body weight, average daily gain and growth QTL. The results of this study can shed light on the genetic mechanism of biological functions of growth factors in broiler chickens, which is useful for developing management practices and accelerating genetic progress in breeding programs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal genetics 3aaverage daily gain 3abiomarkers 3abody weight 3acattle 3acrossbreds 3agenome-wide association study 3agrowth curves 3ameat quality 3aphenotype 3aquantitative traits 3asheep1 aAnsari Mahyari, S.1 aVaez Torshizi, R.1 aLanjanian, H.1 aMasoudi‐Nejad, A.0 tAnimal genetics.g2021 Apr., v. 52, no. 2 p.171-184dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl38565x0268-91467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/age.130383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04041naa a2200721 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001500164245016900179300001800348520182200366592002802188650002102216650002702237650002402264650002602288650002802314650002702342650002902369650001302398650001102411650001002422650001302432650001002445650001002455650001202465650001102477650002202488650000702510650001402517650001402531650001302545650001302558650001202571650001202583650005102595650002302646650004402669650002002713650004102733650004102774650003102815650001202846650003802858650003202896650002802928650005502956650002703011650001603038700001903054700001703073700001503090700001403105700001703119773011403136856004803250852000903298655001203307IND4473053720221119084334.0121003e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447305372DNAL7 a222586432pmid7 a10.1007/s00253-011-3863-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Hong10aProduction, purification, and characterization of the cecropin from Plutella xylostella, pxCECA1, using an intein-induced self-cleavable system in Escherichia coli   ap. 1031-1039.  aAntimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are widely expressed and play an important role in innate immune defense against infectious agents such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites. Cecropins are a family of AMPs synthesized in the fat body of insects that have proven effective at killing specific pathogens. In order to fulfill their clinical potential as antimicrobial drugs, a simple, cost-effective method to express AMPs is sorely needed. In this study, we expressed and characterized the cecropin from Plutella xylostella (pxCECA1) using an intein-dependent expression system in Escherichia coli. We cloned the pxCECA1 gene from larva by RT-PCR and fused the encoding sequence of mature pxCECA1 with an intein gene and a chitin-binding domain gene (CBD) in pTWIN1 plasmid. The fusion protein CBD–intein–pxCECA1 was expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) and separated by flowing cell extracts through a chitin column. Subsequently, self-cleavage of the intein at its C-terminus was induced in a temperature- and pH-dependent manner, resulting in the release of mature pxCECA1. The optimal conditions for self-cleavage were determined to be pH 6.0 for 48 h at 4°C, under which 12.3 mg of recombinant pxCECA1 could be recovered from 1 l of E. coli culture. The purified pxCECA1 displayed antimicrobial activity against a broad variety of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. This preparation was especially effective against Staphylococcus aureus, including methicillin-resistant strains. Catalase release assays demonstrated that pxCECA1 acts as a microbicidal agent. These results show for the first time that the IMPACT-TWIN expression system is an efficient, cost-effective way to produce fully functional AMPs and that the AMP pxCECA1 is a novel microbicidal agent with promising therapeutic applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aGram-positive bacteria 3aPlutella xylostella 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aadenosine monophosphate 3aantimicrobial peptides 3aantimicrobial properties 3acatalase 3achitin 3adrugs 3afat body 3afungi 3agenes 3ainsects 3alarvae 3amolecular cloning 3apH 3aparasites 3apathogens 3aplasmids 3aproteins 3aviruses 2aAnimals 2aCecropinsxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aCloning, Molecular 2aEscherichia colixgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGene Expression 2aGram-Negative Bacteriaxdrug effects 2aGram-Positive Bacteriaxdrug effects 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aInteins 2aLepidopteraxchemistryxgenetics. 2aMicrobial Sensitivity Tests 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aRecombinant Fusion Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aTemperature1 aMeng, Xiao-lin1 aXu, Jin-ping1 aWang, Jian1 aWang, Hua1 aMa, Chun-wei0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2012 May, v. 94, no. 4 p.1031-1039dSpringer-Verlagx0175-75987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-011-3863-5  aDNAL 7aarticle02860naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001500164245014400179300001800323520121400341592002801555650001901583650002401602650002001626650001301646650002601659650002901685650006401714650001201778650001401790650002001804650005201824650002901876650003301905650001101938650005301949650001902002650003802021650002002059650002002079650002402099700001702123700001302140700001502153700001802168773009902186856004802285852000902333655001202342IND4473698920221119002043.0121003e201111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447369892DNAL7 a219188652pmid7 a10.1007/s00705-011-1097-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGong, Jian10aRhesus monkey TRIM5α represses HIV-1 LTR promoter activity by negatively regulating TAK1/TAB1/TAB2/TAB3-complex-mediated NF-κB activation  ap. 1997-2006.  aTRIM5α has been identified as the main restriction factor responsible for resistance of Old World monkey cells to HIV-1 infection. The precise mechanism of viral inhibition by TRIM5α remains elusive but appears to occur in multiple ways. Here, we report that rhesus monkey TRIM5α (TRIM5αrh) can represses HIV-1 LTR promoter activity by negatively regulating TAK1/TAB1/TAB2/TAB3-complex-mediated NF-κB activation when TRIM5αrh is overexpressed. We show that the overexpressed TRIM5αrh can interact with the TAK1/TAB1/TAB2/TAB3 complex by binding to TAB1 and promotes the degradation of TAB2 within the complex via the lysosomal degradation pathway. Subsequently, TRIM5αrh lowers the IKKα protein level and inhibits NF-κB p65 phosphorylation, and knockdown of TRIM5αrh expression by small interfering RNA in TRIM5αrh-overexpressing cells can abolish this inhibition. Finally, the inhibition of p65 phosphorylation results in the repression of HIV-1 LTR promoter activity. Taken together, these findings indicate that TRIM5αrh plays a previously unrecognized role in repressing HIV-1 transcription by inhibiting TAK1/TAB1/TAB2/TAB3-complex-mediated NF-κB activation when TRIM5αrh is overexpressed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMacaca mulatta 3agene overexpression 3aphosphorylation 3aproteins 3asmall interfering RNA 3atranscription (genetics) 2aAdaptor Proteins, Signal Transducingxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aAnimals 2aCell Line 2aDown-Regulation 2aHIV Infectionsxgeneticsxmetabolismxvirology. 2aHIV Long Terminal Repeat 2aHIV-1xgeneticsxphysiology. 2aHumans 2aMAP Kinase Kinase Kinasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMacaca mulatta 2aNF-kappa Bxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPhosphorylation 2aProtein Binding 2aSignal Transduction1 aShen, Xi-Hui1 aQiu, Hui1 aChen, Chao1 aYang, Rong-Ge0 tArchives of virology.g2011 Nov., v. 156, no. 11 p.1997-2006dSpringer-Verlagx0304-86087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00705-011-1097-6  aDNAL 7aarticle02497naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001500138245012400153300001400277520139000291592002801681653003901709653004901748653001401797653001201811653001601823653000801839700001801847700002801865700001501893700001701908773015301925856007202078852000902150655001202159IND60131673420221119200009.0151127e200703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013167342DNAL7 a10.1638/05-097.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArif, Abdi10aContagious caprine pleuropneumonia outbreak in captive wild ungulates at al wabra wildlife preservation, state of qatar  ap. 93-96.  aContagious caprine pleuropneumonia (CCPP) caused by Mycoplasma capricolum subsp.capripneumoniae is a highly contagious and serious respiratory disease of domestic goats, characterized by coughing, severe respiratory distress, and high mortality rates. The lesions at necropsy are mainly a fibrinous pleuropneumonia with increased straw-colored pleural fluid. An outbreak of CCPP in wild goat (Capra aegagrus), Nubian ibex (Capra ibex nubiana), Laristan mouflon (Ovis orientalis laristanica), and gerenuk (Litocranius walleri) occurred at Al Wabra Wildlife Preservation in the State of Qatar. The disease was suspected because of the clinical symptoms and the necropsy findings and was confirmed by the isolation and identification of the causative organism. This new finding indicates that CCPP should be considered a potential threat to wildlife and the conservation of endangered ruminant species, especially in the Middle East, where it is enzootic because of its presence in chronic carriers. Susceptible imported animals should be quarantined and vaccinated. The preferred samples for diagnosis are the pleural fluid, which contains high numbers of Mycoplasma, and sections of hepatized lung, preferably at the interface of normal and diseased tissues. Samples must be shipped to diagnostic laboratories rapidly, and appropriate cool conditions must be maintained during shipping.  aPublisher supplied data 0aContagious caprine pleuropneumonia 0aMycoplasma capricolum subsp. capripneumoniae 0awild goat 0agerenuk 0aNubian ibex 0aPCR1 aSchulz, Julia1 aThiaucourt, Franççois1 aTaha, Abid1 aHammer, Sven0 tJournal of zoo and wildlife medicine.g2007 Mar., v. 38, no. 1 p.93-96dAmerican Association of Zoo VeterinarianswJournal:jnl43569x1937-28257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1638/05-097.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03099naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245008600158300001800244520205100262592002802313650004402341650002202385650001602407650001002423650002002433650002102453650002002474650001402494700001902508700001602527700002002543773010202563856007502665852000902740655001202749IND60531029820221122220030.0160723e20120214xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053102982DNAL7 a10.1021/bi201676y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKatayama, Kota10aProtein-Bound Water Molecules in Primate Red- and Green-Sensitive Visual Pigments  ap. 1126-1133.  aProtein-bound water molecules play crucial roles in the structure and function of proteins. The functional role of water molecules has been discussed for rhodopsin, the light sensor for twilight vision, on the basis of X-ray crystallography, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and a radiolytic labeling method, but nothing is known about the protein-bound waters in our color visual pigments. Here we apply low-temperature FTIR spectroscopy to monkey red (MR)- and green (MG)-sensitive color pigments at 77 K and successfully identify water vibrations using D₂O and D₂¹⁸O in the whole midinfrared region. The observed water vibrations are 6–8 for MR and MG, indicating that several water molecules are present near the retinal chromophore and change their hydrogen bonds upon retinal photoisomerization. In this sense, color visual pigments possess protein-bound water molecules essentially similar to those of rhodopsin. The absence of strongly hydrogen-bonded water molecules (O–D stretch at <2400 cm–¹) is common between rhodopsin and color pigments, which greatly contrasts with the case of proton-pumping microbial rhodopsins. On the other hand, two important differences are observed in water signal between rhodopsin and color pigments. First, the water vibrations are identical between the 11-cis and 9-cis forms of rhodopsin, but different vibrational bands are observed at >2550 cm–¹ for both MR and MG. Second, strongly hydrogen-bonded water molecules (2303 cm–¹ for MR and 2308 cm–¹ for MG) are observed for the all-trans form after retinal photoisomerization, which is not the case for rhodopsin. These specific features of MR and MG can be explained by the presence of water molecules in the Cl–-biding site, which are located near positions C11 and C9 of the retinal chromophore. The averaged frequencies of the observed water O–D stretching vibrations for MR and MG are lower as the λₘₐₓ is red-shifted, suggesting that water molecules are involved in the color tuning of our vision.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3abound water 3acolor 3adeuterium oxide 3ahydrogen bonding 3aprotein binding 3arhodopsin1 aFurutani, Yuji1 aImai, Hiroo1 aKandori, Hideki0 tBiochemistry.g2012 Feb. 14, v. 51, no. 6 p.1126-1133dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-49957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fbi201676y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02972naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005700139245019800196300001800394500002000412520111800432592002801550596005601578596010801634650003001742650002501772650001601797650002101813650001501834650002701849650002001876650001601896650002101912650001701933650001501950650001301965650001201978650001501990650001302005650001602018650001602034650001102050650001202061650002602073650001802099650001102117650001202128650001402140700006002154773012202214856007302336852000902409655001202418IND60694351520221122234843.0200513e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069435152DNAL7 a10.1111/are.145682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGhanawi, Joly1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7945-205510aUsing fatty acid markers to distinguish between effects of salmon (Salmo salar) and halibut (Hippoglossus hippoglossus) farming on mackerel (Scomber scombrus) and whiting (Merlangius merlangus)  ap. 2229-2242.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aPresence of coastal aquaculture activities in marine landscapes is growing with impacts on the wild fish that share these habitats. However, it is difficult to disentangle subsequent ecological interactions between these activities and marine fish communities. We evaluated the impact of both salmon and halibut farms on mackerel (Scomber scombrus) and whiting (Merlangius merlangus) sampled near sea cages using condition indices and fatty acid (FA) biomarkers. Results of the stomach content analysis indicated that mackerel and whiting consumed waste feed which was also reflected in their modified FA profiles. Both mackerel and whiting had elevated levels of FAs that are of vegetable oils origin. The use of vegetable oils as replacement for marine oils is a lot more common in salmon farming than halibut farming. Additionally, the overall effects of the two fish farms were more pronounced in whiting than in mackerel sampled near the sea cages. By allowing discrimination between sources of trophic interactions, this method could lead to more informed decisions in managing different farming activities.  aPublisher supplied data  aSmall grantcFisheries Society of the British Isles  aPhD fundingcUniversity of Stirling and Marine Alliance for Science and Technology for Scotland (MASTS) 3aHippoglossus hippoglossus 3aMerlangius merlangus 3aSalmo salar 3aScomber scombrus 3abiomarkers 3aecological competition 3afarming systems 3afatty acids 3afish communities 3afish culture 3afish farms 3ahabitats 3ahalibut 3alandscapes 3amackerel 3amariculture 3amarine fish 3asalmon 3astomach 3atrophic relationships 3avegetable oil 3awastes 3awhiting 3awild fish1 aMcAdam, Bruce J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6117-24370 tAquaculture research.g2020 June, v. 51, no. 6 p.2229-2242dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl53865x1355-557X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/are.145683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03055naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001900154245014100173300001600314520157000330592002801900650002501928650003601953650001701989650002102006650001902027650002502046650001902071650001502090653002502105653003702130653001702167653003702184653001302221653002102234700002002255700002402275700003802299700002802337700002302365773012302388856008902511852000902600655001202609IND60543426720221120092058.0190410e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054342672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2015.09.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIovescu, Alina12aA combined binding mechanism of nonionic ethoxylated surfactants to bovine serum albumin revealed by fluorescence and circular dichroism  ap. 198-205.  aThe study systematically investigates aqueous mixtures of fixed bovine serum albumin (BSA) and various ethoxylated nonionic surfactants belonging to a homologous series or not. Mono-disperse tetra-(C12E4), hexa-(C12E6) and octa-ethyleneglycol mono-n-dodecyl ether (C12E8), and poly-disperse eicosa-ethyleneglycol mono-n-tetradecyl ether (C14EO20) are respectively employed. Fluorescence and circular dichroism measurements are performed at surfactant/protein molar ratios (rm)s lower and higher than one. We aim to get new insights into the binding mechanism of these species and to differentiate among the interaction abilities of these surfactants. The relative magnitude of the binding thermodynamic parameters by fluorescence, and the increase of α-helix prove that hydrogen bonding drives the interaction next to the hydrophobic attraction. C12En (n=4,6,8) develop more H bonds with the albumin than C14EO20 owing to a zigzag conformation of their short ethyleneoxide chains. Among the homologous surfactants, C12E6 has a slightly stronger interaction with BSA due to a maximal number of H bonds at a minimal hindering. Static fluorescence and dynamic fluorescence indicate an inter-conversion between the tryptophan (Trp) rotamers which happens around the surfactants critical micellar concentration. For C14EO20, the meander conformation of the polar group determines a less evident conversion of the Trp rotamers and smaller α-helix rise. Binding isotherms of the homologous surfactants and the fluorescence quenching mechanism by C12E6 are also provided.  aPublisher supplied data 3abovine serum albumin 3acircular dichroism spectroscopy 3afluorescence 3ahydrogen bonding 3ahydrophobicity 3anonionic surfactants 3athermodynamics 3atryptophan 0aBovine serum albumin 0aEthoxylated nonionic surfactants 0aFluorescence 0aBinding thermodynamic parameters 0aα-Helix 0aHydrogen bonding1 aBăran, Adriana1 aStîngă, Gabriela,1 aCantemir-Leontieş, Anca Ruxandra1 aMaxim, Monica Elisabeta1 aAnghel, Dan Florin0 tJournal of photochemistry and photobiology.g2015 Dec., v. 153 p.198-205dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6193x1011-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2015.09.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02615naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024001900116024003500135040001800170100007200188245012000260300001100380506007600391520098700467592002801454506003701482650004401519650001601563650001401579650002401593650001101617650001501628650000701643650001201650650002401662650003301686650001601719650001401735650001101749700002601760700002701786700003201813700002601845700002501871700002801896773010601924856008202030852000902112655001202121IND60572725220221207131937.0220831e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057272522DNAL7 aPMC54280892pmcid7 a284520202pmid7 a10.1007/s13205-017-0655-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMuthukumaran, Chandrasekaran1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3104-835X10aPectin from muskmelon (Cucumis melo var. reticulatus) peels: extraction optimization and physicochemical properties  ap. 66.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPectin derived from plant waste sources is currently focused as an economical and eco-friendly approach. Optimization of pectin extraction from muskmelon peel by response surface methodology (RSM) was investigated in this study. Box–Behnken Design (BBD) was used to identify the optimal level of the extraction variables such as time, pH and temperature. A second-order model equation for pectin extraction was obtained from multiple regression analysis of experimental data with the correlation coefficient (R ²) value of 0.92. ANOVA results showed that linear effect of temperature and combined effect of pH with temperature were found significant for pectin extraction from muskmelon peel. Validation results had good agreement with the predicted results. Pectin extracted from muskmelon peel was classed as high methoxy pectin with the equivalent weight of 384.5 g/mol. Non-newtonian pseudoplastic flow behaviour was observed for muskmelon pectin from the viscosity studies.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCucumis melo subsp. melo var. cantalupo 3acorrelation 3aequations 3aexperimental design 3amodels 3amuskmelons 3apH 3apectins 3aregression analysis 3aresponse surface methodology 3atemperature 3aviscosity 3awastes1 aBanupriya, Loganathan1 aHarinee, Somasundharam1 aSivaranjani, Sivagurunathan1 aSharmila, Govindasamy1 aRajasekar, Vinayagam1 aKumar, Narasimhan Manoj0 t3 Biotech.g2017 May, v. 7, no. 1 p.66-66dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:22884x2190-572X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13205-017-0655-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02652naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002200144245006700166300002000233500001900253520109700272592002801369650002201397650001501419650000801434650002601442650001101468650001301479650001301492653003101505653001601536653001801552653002901570653001801599653002001617653004101637700002701678700002501705700001801730700002101748700002501769700001801794700005501812700006201867773014201929856007802071852000902149655001202158IND60711367120210831000000.0200923e20200810xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071136712DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.0c111342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarter, Joseph H.10aLong-Term Stability of MFM-300(Al) toward Toxic Air Pollutants  ap. 42949-42954.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aTemperature- or pressure-swing sorption in porous metal–organic framework (MOF) materials has been proposed for new gas separation technologies. The high tunability of MOFs toward particular adsorbates and the relatively low energy penalty for system regeneration indicate that reversible physisorption in MOFs has the potential to create economic and environmental benefits compared with state-of-the-art chemisorption systems. However, for MOF-based sorbents to be commercialized, they have to show long-term stability under the conditions imposed by the application. Here, we demonstrate the structural stability of MFM-300(Al) in the presence of a series of industrially relevant toxic and corrosive gases, including SO₂, NO₂, and NH₃, over 4 years using long-duration synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction. Full structural analysis of gas-loaded MFM-300(Al) confirms the retention of these toxic gas molecules within the porous framework for up to 200 weeks, and cycling adsorption experiments verified the reusability of MFM-300(Al) for the capture of these toxic air pollutants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aadsorption 3aair 3acoordination polymers 3aenergy 3asorbents 3atoxicity 0ametal−organic frameworks 0atoxic gases 0aair pollution 0aflue gas desulfurization 0aNO2 abatement 0aammonia storage 0asynchrotron X-ray powder diffraction1 aMorris, Christopher G.1 aGodfrey, Harry G.

Michael13aAn analysis of ash and isotopic carbon discrimination (Δ13C) methods to evaluate water use efficiency in apple  ap. 32-36.  aApple cultivars are selected for fruit quality, disease and insect resistance, not water use efficiency (WUE), however, the need for more water use efficient crops is accelerating due to climate change and increased competition for water resources. WUE be calculated from short-term gas exchange measurements of photosynthesis (A) and transpiration (Ec) and expressed as A/Ec (instantaneous water use efficiency; WUEInst), or on a whole plant basis, measuring leaf, fruit and wood dry matter (DM) together with a measurement of water use (WU), and expressed as DM/WU. Plant ash and carbon isotope discrimination (Δ13C) have been correlated with water use efficiency in herbaceous plants. The purpose of this study was to measure WUEInst and seasonal WUE of mature and productive apple trees in the field and evaluate WUE correlations with ash and Δ13C. WUEInst was measured in whole tree gas exchange studies and from seasonal dry matter yield studies in ‘Empire’ apple for 2005, 2007 and 2009. Leaf ash and Δ13C were positively correlated with mean tree photosynthetic rate (A) and transpiration (Ec) but only leaf Δ13C was negatively correlated with WUEInst. In seasonal dry matter yield studies, leaf ash and Δ13C responses were highly negatively correlated with WUE based on the annual fruit yield/seasonal potential transpiration (Ef), termed WUEFrt. There were also highly significant correlations between leaf and shoot ash with leaf and shoot Δ13C. Both leaf ash and Δ13C were useful in identifying extremes in apple WUE and leaf ash can be used at a much lower cost with a high through-put potential.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMalus domestica 3aapples 3acarbon 3aclimate change 3acorrelation 3acrops 3acultivars 3adry matter accumulation 3afruit quality 3afruit yield 3agas exchange 3aherbaceous plants 3ainsects 3aisotopes 3aleaves 3aphotosynthesis 3atranspiration 3atrees 3awater resources 3awater use efficiency 0aMalus×domestica 0aPhotosynthesis 0aTranspiration 0aWhole tree gas exchange 0aYield0 tScientia horticulturae.g2014 May 26, v. 171 p.32-36dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4108x0304-42387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2014.03.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03192naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245011100173300001600284500001900300520182600319536005602145592002802201596001102229650001302240650001702253650001402270650001702284650001002301650001002311650003502321653001202356653002002368653001802388700002002406700002302426700001902449700002902468700002002497700001502517773012002532856008502652852000902737655001202746IND60719846620221119012257.0201207e20200702xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071984662DNAL7 a10.1080/1059924X.2020.17655952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSørensen, Julie,10aJA:2021-36. NY Nudging Dairy Safety Project: Re-engineering Best Management Safety Practices on NY Dairies  ap. 259-260.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPurpose: Nudging incorporates adjustments to a task or environment in ways that nudge people to do the right thing, sometimes without them even having to think about it. The project will seek to address dairy labor and safety challenges by examining the efficacy of “nudging” principles to improve worker safety and the efficiency of work processes. Methods: Researchers will ask farmers to select three issues on the farm that they would like to resolve. Data will be collected to further define and elucidate these issues (i.e. survey data, mapping the task environment, videotaping tasks, and interviewing workers). Each of these issues will be assessed by the project team to select one issue that fulfills the following criteria: 1) the root cause is a behavioral problem; 2) safety could be incorporated into the solution; and 3) it could be reasonably implemented and evaluated. Project team members will then conduct a behavioral reduction, map the behavior, assess the behavioral components, apply a priority filter, and develop a solution using the cognitive strategy best suited to the issue. Results/Findings: Interviews and surveys will be conducted before and after the implementation of nudging projects to evaluate: 1) the process and 2) the outcomes (are safer practices being adopted by workers? If yes, has time to perform the task been reduced? Has effort to perform the task been reduced? Have other efficiencies been created?). Practical Application: Videos and one-page summaries of nudging projects will be created. These will be featured on the Northeast Center for Occupational Health and Safety (NEC) website and circulated at events such as the NY Farm Show and Empire Farm Days. NEC trainers will share one-pagers with farmers at safety trainings and during worksite safety walk-throughs.  aNew York Farm Viability Institute Grant, #FVI 19003  aPublisher supplied data  a19 003 3aInternet 3aagromedicine 3acognition 3adairy safety 3afarms 3alabor 3aoccupational health and safety 0aNudging 0abehavior change 0ainterventions1 aCarrabba, James1 aBirk-Domino, Helle1 aMcNamara, John1 aVan den Broucke, Stephan1 aMeyerhoff, Anna1 aTodd, Ryan0 tJournal of agromedicine.g2020 July 02, v. 25, no. 3 p.259-260dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl51337x1545-08137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1059924X.2020.17655953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03390naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245016800168300001600336500001900352520185300371592002802224650001202252650002502264650001102289650002302300650001202323650000902335650001202344650001402356650001402370650001102384650001102395650001602406650001502422650001102437650002002448650002202468650001502490650001402505650001502519700003302534700003302567700005702600700002402657773011202681856008202793852000902875655001202884IND60738273120221120133025.0210522e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073827312DNAL7 a10.1007/s12600-020-00879-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDameda, Catiane10aEuseius concordis (chant) (Acari: Phytoseiidae) as a potential agent for the control of yerba mate red mite Oligonychus yothersi (McGregor) (Acari: Tetranychidae)  ap. 377-383.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aOligonychus yothersi (McGregor) (Acari: Tetranychidae), known as yerba mate red mite, is typically found on the abaxial face of leaves, feeding on mesophyll cell contents in yerba mate crops. Euseius concordis (Chant) is a generalist mite, feeding on other mites, pollen, and nectar, and can be a promising control agent of O. yothersi. This study aimed to evaluate development time, reproduction, survival, and sex ratio of this predatory mite when feeding on O. yothersi on yerba mate leaves. A life-cycle study was performed in a climate chamber at 22 ± 1 °C and 12 hours of photophase, 19 ± 1 °C during scotophase, and 70 ± 10% relative humidity. The study started with 36 experimental units, which were examined three times a day during immature development and once during the adult stage to evaluate reproductive parameters. Mean developmental times of egg, larva, protonymph, deutonymph, and egg-adult stages were the following: for females, 2.14 ± 0.15, 1.59 ± 0.12, 1.97 ± 0.11, 2.18 ± 0.13, and 7.88 ± 0.21, respectively; for males, 2.00 ± 0.67, 1.77 ± 0.52, 1.94 ± 0.52, 2.05 ± 0.69, and 7.75 ± 1.08. Mean pre-oviposition, oviposition, and post-oviposition periods were 3.31 ± 0.33, 10.4 ± 0.74, and 1.50 ± 0.28, respectively. Sex ratio was 0.67 and mean life expectancy was 15.22 days for females and 12.51 ± 1.91 days for males. Mean daily oviposition was 1.67 ± 0.08 eggs per female, with a mean value of 20.14 ± 1.42 eggs per female. T, Rₒ, rₘ, λ, and DT values were: 16.33, 10.03, 0.14, 1.15, and 4.91, respectively. This study demonstrated that E. concordis is a predator with potential to be used in biological control programs, successfully developing and reproducing when feeding on O. yothersi under laboratory conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuseius 3aOligonychus yothersi 3aadults 3abiological control 3aclimate 3aeggs 3afemales 3alongevity 3amesophyll 3anectar 3anymphs 3aoviposition 3aphotophase 3apollen 3apredatory mites 3arelative humidity 3ascotophase 3asex ratio 3ayerba mate1 aBerté, Amália Luisa Winter1 ada Silva, Guilherme Liberato1 aJohann, Liana1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7105-98061 aFerla, Noeli Juarez0 tPhytoparasitica.g2021 July, v. 49, no. 3 p.377-383dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl9750x0334-21237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12600-020-00879-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01218naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245009900166300001300265500002200278520025400300592002800554650002500582650002100607650001300628700005800641773015000699856008200849852000900931655001200940IND60642337320221121023237.0190507e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064233732DNAL7 a10.1007/s00018-019-03087-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Wen-Ting10aCorrection to: Dgcr8 knockout approaches to understand microRNA functions in vitro and in vivo  ap. 2245.  aPublished Erratum  aThe section: “miRNA‑independent functions of DICER” was missed between the section “miRNA‑independent functions of DROSHA and DGCR8” and the section “The Dgcr8 knockout strategy to study miRNA functions” in the original publications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA-binding proteins 3aknockout mutants 3amicroRNA1 aWang, Yangming1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6974-60600 tCellular and molecular life sciences.g2019 June, v. 76, no. 11 p.2245-2245dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl55291x1420-682X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00018-019-03087-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02911naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100001700148245013500165300001400300520157000314592002801884650001101912650001901923650001901942650001601961650000901977650002801986650002702014650001002041650001202051650002002063650002302083650001402106650001202120700002502132700002202157700001702179700002202196700001902218700001602237700001602253773009102269856008402360852000902444655001202453IND4480427720221120195015.0141112e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448042772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.livsci.2011.06.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKenyon, P.R.14aThe effect of ewe size and nutritional regimen beginning in early pregnancy on development of singleton foetuses in late pregnancy  ap. 92-98.  aThis study set out to investigate the effects of ewe size and pregnancy nutritional level on the development of singleton-foetuses in late pregnancy and was part of a large study investigating life-time effects of maternal nutrition on the offspring. Heavy (H) and light (L) Romney ewes were allocated to ad libitum (A) or maintenance (M) nutritional regimens from day 21–day 140 of pregnancy (P21–P140). At P140, 39 singleton-bearing ewes (HA: n=9, HM: n=10, LA: n=10, LM: n=10) were euthanized and ewe and foetal organs were collected and weighed. L-ewes were lighter (P<0.05) and gained (P<0.05) more live weight during pregnancy than H-ewes. M-ewes were lighter (P<0.05) and gained (P<0.05) less live weight during pregnancy than A-ewes. Foetuses from M-ewes had lighter (P<0.05) thyroid glands and spleens than did foetuses from A-ewes. However, no ewe-size or nutritional effects were found (P>0.05) on foetal weight or dimensions, weight of kidney, perirenal fat, heart, thymus, adrenal glands or gastrointestinal tract, mammary gland, ovaries or scrotum. In conclusion, these findings indicate that singleton-bearing ewes are able to buffer their foetus against maintenance nutrition to protect foetal growth and development in late pregnancy. In addition, singleton-bearing ewes fed ad libitum, partition the excess nutrients to itself rather than further enhancing foetal development. Ewe size had no effect on size or development of singleton-foetuses at P140, indicating that maternal size is of less importance when the ewe is carrying a singleton.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRomney 3aadrenal glands 3aanimal ovaries 3abody weight 3aewes 3agastrointestinal system 3agrowth and development 3aheart 3akidneys 3amaternal effect 3amaternal nutrition 3apregnancy 3ascrotum1 avan der Linden, D.S.1 aJenkinson, C.M.C.1 aMorris, S.T.1 aMackenzie, D.D.S.1 aPeterson, S.W.1 aFirth, E.C.1 aBlair, H.T.0 tLivestock science.g2011 Dec., v. 142, no. 1-3 p.92-98dElsevier B.V.x1871-14137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.livsci.2011.06.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04882naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002100144245015800165300002000323500001900343520304700362592002803409650001503437650000803452650002403460650001203484650001503496650003403511650002203545650002803567650001803595650001303613650001203626650001103638650001203649650002203661653002803683653002403711653002603735653002603761653002103787653002403808700002103832700006103853700005903914700006103973700001704034700006004051773014204111856007804253852000904331655001204340IND60711367320221122061833.0200923e20200814xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071136732DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.0c112082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGumbi, Sifiso W.10aElectronic and Simple Oscillatory Conduction in Ferrite Gas Sensors: Gas-Sensing Mechanisms, Long-Term Gas Monitoring, Heat Transfer, and Other Anomalies  ap. 43231-43249.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe early detection and warning of the presence of hazardous gases have been well studied. We present a study that focuses on some fundamental properties of gas sensors for liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) using spinel nanoferrites, namely, CoSm₀.₁Fe₁.₉O₄, CoCe₀.₁Fe₁.₉O₄, MgCe₀.₁Fe₁.₉O₄, and MgFe₂O₄. A highly sensitive and selective response of 846.34 at 225 °C toward 10,000 ppm concentration of LPG was recorded. Other flammable gases tested were hydrogen, methane, propane, and butane. Electronic conduction of LPG sensors near saturation showed simple electrical oscillations that can be attributed to the self-dissociation of water molecules physically adsorbed on the surface of the chemisorbed oxygen species due to proton transfer. The oscillatory behaviors follow fluctuations in the operating temperature attributed to heat transfer between the physisorbed water molecules and the hot sensor surface. This depends on the LPG concentration because higher LPG concentration gives rise to greater heat transfer from the sensors. The adsorption and desorption of these water molecule multilayers take a few hundreds of seconds at low concentrations, while the adsorption formation process takes longer at higher concentrations. Other parameters such as LPG exposure time, bias voltage, relative humidity, ambient conditions, operating temperatures, and temperature of the gas not only affect electrical oscillations and thermal fluctuations but also switch the dominant charge carriers from p- to n-type or vice versa. The type of sensor surface, either p- or n-type, did not appear to affect the oscillatory behavior, while the exposure time, short or long, determined the appearance and further behavior of the oscillations. The long-time exposure to 10,000 ppm concentration resulted in the resistance gradually decreasing due to the lack of oxygen supply, while at 5000 ppm, this was constant, stable, and oscillated indefinitely. Changing the dry air to argon gas as a carrier and for dilution of the hazardous gas prevented the electrical oscillations and thermal fluctuations and significantly lowered the response values. Both the inert ambient (argon gas) and changing operating temperature flipped the dominant charge carriers of these sensors. The concentration of these chemisorbed oxygen species governs the charge space and depletion layers. In addition, the spinel nanoferrites used contained higher oxygen vacancies than the lattice oxygen and chemisorbed oxygen. When using dry air, the oscillations were observed at 3000 ppm concentration, while using argon gas, they were observed at 7000 ppm concentration. The room-temperature LPG responses were about 35 and 80 under 45% relative humidity using dry air and argon gas, respectively. These room-temperature measurements showed electrical oscillations but did not show any thermal fluctuations or heat transfer phenomena. This study presents a deeper insight into the fundamentals of gas-sensing mechanisms and energy costs involved.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aair 3aambient temperature 3abutanes 3adesorption 3aelectric potential difference 3aexposure duration 3aferrimagnetic materials 3aheat transfer 3ahydrogen 3amethane 3aoxygen 3apropane 3arelative humidity 0aoscillatory gas sensing 0aprotonic conduction 0aelectronic conduction 0acarrier type reversal 0ainverse ferrites 0athermal fluctuation1 aMkwae, Prince S.1 aKortidis, Ioannis1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7889-26491 aKroon, Robin E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9728-93701 aSwart, Hendrik C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5233-01301 aMoyo, Thomas1 aNkosi, Steven S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0805-18950 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2020 Aug. 14, v. 12, no. 38 p.43231-43249dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c112083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02831naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001700143245012400160520147600284592002801760650000801788650002601796650001501822650002801837650001301865650003601878650001201914650002001926650001801946650001601964650002801980650001702008650002402025650002502049700001702074700001702091700001802108700001702126700001802143700001702161773012002178856007802298852000902376655001202385IND60760640520221121073050.0211223e20211208xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076064052DNAL7 a10.3390/foods101230532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHao, Jingyi 10aSynergetic Inactivation Mechanism of Protocatechuic Acid and High Hydrostatic Pressure against Escherichia coli O157:H7  aWith the wide application of high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) technology in the food industry, safety issues regarding food products, resulting in potential food safety hazards, have arisen. To address such problems, this study explored the synergetic bactericidal effects and mechanisms of protocatechuic acid (PCA) and HHP against Escherichia coli O157:H7. At greater than 200 MPa, PCA (1.25 mg/mL for 60 min) plus HHP treatments had significant synergetic bactericidal effects that positively correlated with pressure. After a combined treatment at 500 MPa for 5 min, an approximate 9.0 log CFU/mL colony decline occurred, whereas the individual HHP and PCA treatments caused 4.48 and 1.06 log CFU/mL colony decreases, respectively. Mechanistically, membrane integrity and morphology were damaged, and the permeability increased when E. coli O157: H7 was exposed to the synergetic stress of PCA plus HHP. Inside cells, the synergetic treatment additionally targeted the activities of enzymes such as superoxide dismutase, catalase and ATPase, which were inhibited significantly (p ≤ 0.05) when exposed to high pressure. Moreover, an analysis of circular dichroism spectra indicated that the synergetic treatment caused a change in DNA structure, which was expressed as the redshift of the characteristic absorption peak. Thus, the synergetic treatment of PCA plus HHP may be used as a decontamination method owing to the good bactericidal effects on multiple targets.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aEscherichia coli O157 3aabsorption 3aadenosinetriphosphatase 3acatalase 3acircular dichroism spectroscopy 3adecline 3adecontamination 3afood industry 3afood safety 3ahigh pressure treatment 3apermeability 3aprotocatechuic acid 3asuperoxide dismutase1 aLei, Yuqing 1 aGan, Zhilin 1 aZhao, Wanbin 1 aShi, Junyan 1 aJia, Chengli 1 aSun, Aidong 0 tFoods.g2021 Dec. 08, v. 10, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods101230533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01297naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002700138245013500165300001800300520022400318592002800542650001200570650002300582650002200605650000900627650001400636650001100650700002500661700002200686700002000708700002000728773012900748856007300877852000900950655001200959IND60657589820221120060108.0190816e20041112xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065758982DNAL7 a10.1039/b412016g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 avan den Berg, Tieme A.10aEnhanced selectivity in non-heme iron catalysed oxidation of alkanes with peracids: evidence for involvement of Fe(iv)O species  ap. 2550-2551.  aCatalytic alkane oxidation with high selectivity using peracids and an (N4Py)Fe complex is presented and the role of [(N4Py)Fe(iv)O]²⁺ species, molecular oxygen and hydroxyl radicals in the catalysis is discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkanes 3acatalytic activity 3ahydroxyl radicals 3airon 3aoxidation 3aoxygen1 ade Boer, Johannes W.1 aBrowne, Wesley R.1 aRoelfes, Gerard1 aFeringa, Ben L.0 tChemical communications.g2004 Nov. 12, , no. 22 p.2550-2551dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b412016g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03903naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024002800135040001800163100002000181245015100201300001600352506007600368520147200444592002801916506003701944650002501981650001302006650002802019650003102047650001502078650001402093650001202107650002102119650001202140650005302152650004802205650003802253650004802291650003102339650002902370650004802399650003302447650005302480650001702533650003302550650002402583650002902607650005102636653002402687653002002711653002502731653002502756653001302781653002202794653001902816653002202835700001802857700001702875700002002892700001902912700002202931700001902953773013802972856007403110852000903184655001203193IND60118937720221207065631.0141127e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011893772DNAL7 a241874192pmid7 aPMC38832882pmcid7 a10.1093/jxb/ert3592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCabello, Susana10aAltered sucrose synthase and invertase expression affects the local and systemic sugar metabolism of nematode-infected Arabidopsis thaliana plants  ap. 201-212.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSedentary endoparasitic nematodes of plants induce highly specific feeding cells in the root central cylinder. From these, the obligate parasites withdraw all required nutrients. The feeding cells were described as sink tissues in the plant’s circulation system that are supplied with phloem-derived solutes such as sugars. Currently, there are several publications describing mechanisms of sugar import into the feeding cells. However, sugar processing has not been studied so far. Thus, in the present work, the roles of the sucrose-cleaving enzymes sucrose synthases (SUS) and invertases (INV) in the development of Heterodera schachtii were studied. Gene expression analyses indicate that both enzymes are regulated transcriptionally. Nematode development was enhanced on multiple INV and SUS mutants. Syncytia of these mutants were characterized by altered enzyme activity and changing sugar pool sizes. Further, the analyses revealed systemically affected sugar levels and enzyme activities in the shoots of the tested mutants, suggesting changes in the source–sink relationship. Finally, the development of the root-knot nematode Meloidogyne javanica was studied in different INV and SUS mutants and wild-type Arabidopsis plants. Similar effects on the development of both sedentary endoparasitic nematode species (root-knot and cyst nematode) were observed, suggesting a more general role of sucrose-degrading enzymes during plant–nematode interactions.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aNematoda 3abeta-fructofuranosidase 3agene expression regulation 3ametabolism 3anutrition 3asucrose 3asucrose synthase 2aAnimals 2aArabidopsisxenzymologyxgeneticsxparasitology. 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGlucosyltransferasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aHost-Parasite Interactions 2aMutagenesis, Insertional 2aPhloemxenzymologyxgeneticsxparasitology. 2aPlant Diseasesxparasitology 2aPlant Rootsxenzymologyxgeneticsxparasitology. 2aPlant Shoots 2aPlants, Genetically Modified 2aSucrosexmetabolism 2aTylenchoideaxphysiology 2abeta-Fructofuranosidasexgeneticsxmetabolism. 0aCytosolic invertase 0aenzyme activity 0aHeterodera schachtii 0aMeloidogyne javanica 0anematode 0aneutral invertase 0aplant pathogen 0asucrose synthase.1 aLorenz, Cindy1 aCrespo, Sara1 aCabrera, Javier1 aLudwig, Roland1 aEscobar, Carolina1 aHofmann, Julia0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2014 Jan., v. 65, no. 1 p.201-212dOxford University Press [etc.]wJournal:jnl44658x0022-09577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/ert3593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02057naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002300143245007000166300001600236520091500252592002801167650002201195650000801217650002401225650001101249650001001260650001201270650001301282650001401295653002701309653001801336653001401354653001301368653001401381700002101395700002001416773013701436856007701573852000901650655001201659IND60522255720221122233751.0160602e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052225572DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-2004-09052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAssoud, Abdeljalil10aFrom Yellow to Black: New Semiconducting Ba Chalcogeno-Germanates  ap. 975-979.  aThe new germanates Ba₂GeSe₄₋δ Teδ (δ < 2.5) were prepared by reacting the elements under exclusion of air at 800°C, followed by slow cooling to room temperature. These germanates form the Sr₂GeS₄ type, monoclinic space group P2₁/m, with lattice dimensions of a = 699.58(4), b = 709.38(4), c = 917.38(6) pm, β = 109.135(1)◦, V = 430.11(4) ・ 10⁶ pm³ (Z = 2) for Ba₂GeSe₄. The structure contains isolated GeSe₄ tetrahedra. The oxidation states are assigned to be Baᴵᴵ, Geᴵⱽ, and Se⁻ᴵᴵ. The yellow color of this ortho-seleno-germanate is indicative of semiconducting behavior with an activation energy of 2.6 - 3.0 eV, and the black appearance of the seleno-telluro-germanates points towards gaps < 1.7 eV. Electronic structure calculations based on the LMTO approximation resulted in smaller gaps of 1.7 - 0.8 eV, a tendency that is typical for this calculation method.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivation energy 3aair 3aambient temperature 3abarium 3acolor 3acooling 3ageometry 3aoxidation 0as Electronic Structure 0aSemiconductor 0aGermanium 0aSelenium 0aTellurium1 aSoheilnia, Navid1 aKleinke, Holger0 tZeitschrift für Naturforschung B.g2014 June 2, v. 59, no. 9 p.975-979dVerlag der Zeitschrift für Naturforschungx1865-71177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/znb-2004-09053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03176naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245011000160300001600270500002000286520152800306592002801834596009401862650001901956650001301975650001601988650001202004650001002016650002302026650001902049650000902068650000902077650001702086650001602103650001102119650000902130650001202139650001402151650001102165650001202176650000902188650001702197650001802214650001202232700002402244700001702268700002202285700002202307700002502329700002302354700002002377773011902397856007302516852000902589655001202598IND60679303920221122013504.0191227e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067930392DNAL7 a10.1111/vsu.133132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCradic, David W.10aMorphometric measurements to predict meniscal size in skeletally mature dogs for meniscal transplantation  ap. 172-179.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aOBJECTIVE: To determine a relationship between morphometric measurements (MM) and meniscal dimensions (MD) in the dog. STUDY DESIGN: Cadaveric study. ANIMALS: Eighteen mixed‐breed canine cadavers (22.35 ± 4.06 kg); 36 each of medial and lateral menisci. METHODS: The following MM were obtained in duplicate: height at scapula, withers, pelvis, rump, and greater trochanter; chest circumference; pelvic circumference; length from occiput to the base of the tail; hock to stifle length (HS); body weight; body condition score; and body fat percentage (BF%). Stifles were disarticulated, and digital photographs of in situ menisci were used to obtain meniscal measurements in duplicate. Morphometric parameters were compared with MD via Pearson correlation (r). A correlation of r ≥ 0.65 was considered strong. RESULTS: The strongest correlation was noted between HS and MD, with r = 0.85 for lateral meniscal width, r = 0.77 for medial meniscal length, and r = 0.76 for medial meniscal width. Lateral meniscal length had the strongest correlation with height at rump (HRu) (r = 0.73). Body weight correlated strongly with meniscal width and fairly with meniscal length. Body condition score and BF% correlated weakly with MD. CONCLUSION: Hock to stifle length was an easily obtainable variable and was proportional to MD. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Hock to stifle length may be considered by tissue banks and veterinary surgeons as a quick and cost effective screening tool for appropriate meniscal sizing in dogs.  aPublisher supplied data  cKenneth F.

A questionnaire was designed with open-ended questions in order to collect specific features from farmers and experts from different disciplines. Relevancy of each feature was tested on a four-point Likert scale by farmers and expert group. Features with an average score of more than 2/4 were included and clubbed under 6 main heads namely Culture practices, Management practices, Post-harvest practices, Modern farming techniques, State specific fisheries information and Buy or sell. To aggregate scientific information for each feature, information was collected from various sources like books, articles, websites and research papers. Aggregated information was written in simple language and checked by Grammarly software. Appropriate illustrations were prepared by an artist. Content Validity Ratio was found to be more than 0.75 for each feature and illustration thus establishing content validity. Content along with illustrations was finalized through a write shop process with select experts. Through consensus, the name ‘Mathsya Kiran’ was decided for the mobile app. The app is user friendly, fast, free of cost can be used anytime, anywhere through android mobile without internet. It is of potential use to stakeholders like farmers, students, policy makers and anyone who is interested in fish farming. Based on this comprehensive research, a Mobile App Development Process (MADP) was designed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3aagricultural research 3acomputer software 3afish 3aissues and policy 3aquestionnaires 3astakeholders1 aSharma, Arpita1 aPrasad, K.

Sometimes, MR is undesirable due to lowering the nutrient utilization, producing harmful neo-formed compounds, etc. In this case, it is necessary to control MR. Some chemical substances, such as phenolic acid, vitamins, aminoguanidine, and thiols extracted from garlic or onion, can effectively prevent MR. In this study, L-cysteine (L-cys) was found to inhibit MR after screening 10 sulfhydryl compounds by comparing their ability to mitigate browning. The inhibition mechanism was speculated to be related to the removal of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), a key mid-product of MR. The reaction product of HMF and L-cys was identified and named as 1-dicysteinethioacetal–5-hydroxymethylfurfural (DCH) according to the mass spectrum and nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum of the main product. Furthermore, DCH was detected in the glutamic–fructose mixture after L-cys was added. In addition, the production of DCH also increased with the addition of L-cys. It also was worth noting that DCH showed no cell toxicity to RAW 264.7 cells. Moreover, the in vitro assays indicated that DCH had anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities. In conclusion, L-cys inhibits MR by converting HMF into another adduct DCH with higher safety and health benefits. L-cys has the potential to be applied as an inhibitor to prevent MR during food processing and storage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMaillard reaction 3aantioxidants 3acolor 3acysteine 3acytotoxicity 3aflavor 3agarlic 3ahydroxymethylfurfural 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3anutrient utilization 3anutritive value 3aonions 3aphenolic acids 3athiols1 aZhang, Zhongfei 1 aLi, Jiaoyong 1 aNiu, Yuge 1 aYu, Liangli Lucy0 tFoods.g2021 June 16, v. 10, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods100613913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03910naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024002800135040001800163100001600181245016000197300001600357506007600373520145200449592002801901506003701929650001501966650001701981650002801998650001802026650001402044650004002058650004902098650004802147650002902195650001902224650002902243650001402272650001702286650004202303650003202345650004202377650004102419650003802460650004202498650004802540650003202588650003702620650004502657653002802702653002602730653002902756653002502785653001602810653003402826700002002860700001802880700001902898700001902917700001802936700001802954700001902972773013802991856007403129852000903203655001203212IND60118937820221207065351.0141127e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011893782DNAL7 a242729622pmid7 aPMC38832892pmcid7 a10.1093/jxb/ert3602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJeon, Young14aDER containing two consecutive GTP-binding domains plays an essential role in chloroplast ribosomal RNA processing and ribosome biogenesis in higher plants  ap. 117-130.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThis study investigated protein characteristics and physiological functions of DER (Double Era-like GTPase) of higher plants. Nicotiana benthamiana DER (NbDER) contained two tandemly repeated GTP-binding domains (GD) and a C-terminal domain (CTD) that was similar to the K-homology domain involved in RNA binding. Both GDs possessed GTPase activity and contributed to the maximum GTPase activity of NbDER. NbDER fused to green fluorescent protein was localized primarily to chloroplast nucleoids. Arabidopsis der null mutants exhibited an embryonic lethal phenotype, indicating an essential function of DER during plant embryogenesis. Virus-induced gene silencing of NbDER resulted in a leaf-yellowing phenotype caused by disrupted chloroplast biogenesis. NbDER was associated primarily with the chloroplast 50S ribosomal subunit in vivo, and both the CTD and the two GD contributed to the association. Recombinant proteins of NbDER and its CTD could bind to 23S and 16S ribosomal RNAs in vitro. Depletion of NbDER impaired processing of plastid-encoded ribosomal RNAs, resulting in accumulation of the precursor rRNAs in the chloroplasts. NbDER-deficient chloroplasts contained significantly reduced levels of mature 23S and 16S rRNAs and diverse mRNAs in the polysomal fractions, suggesting decreased translation in chloroplasts. These results suggest that DER is involved in chloroplast rRNA processing and ribosome biogenesis in higher plants.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abiogenesis 3achloroplasts 3aguanosinetriphosphatase 3aribosomal RNA 3aribosomes 2aChloroplastsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGTP Phosphohydrolasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGTP-Binding Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGene Knockout Techniques 2aGene Silencing 2aMutagenesis, Insertional 2aPhenotype 2aPlant Leaves 2aPlant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aProtein Structure, Tertiary 2aRNA Precursorsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRNA Processing, Post-Transcriptional 2aRNA, Plantxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRNA, Ribosomalxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRNA-Binding Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRecombinant Fusion Proteins 2aRibosomesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aTobaccoxcytologyxenzymologyxgenetics. 0aChloroplast abnormality 0aNicotiana benthamiana 0aribosomal RNA processing 0aribosome association 0aRNA binding 0avirus-induced gene silencing.1 aAhn, Chang Sook1 aJung, Hyun Ju1 aKang, Hunseung1 aPark, Guen Tae1 aChoi, Yeonhee1 aHwang, Jihwan1 aPai, Hyun-Sook0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2014 Jan., v. 65, no. 1 p.117-130dOxford University Press [etc.]wJournal:jnl44658x0022-09577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/ert3603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02604naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245011000169300001600279520111500295592002801410650001601438650001901454650001101473650001301484650001601497650002301513650001301536650001901549650001401568650002101582650001601603650001401619653002501633653002801658653003401686653001001720700001901730700002001749700002101769700001701790700001901807700002401826700001601850700002201866773011901888856008202007852000902089655001202098IND60679902720221122082336.0200621e20200214xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067990272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jmb.2019.12.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGagarina, Varvara10aStructural Basis of the Interaction Between Ubiquitin Specific Protease 7 and Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2  ap. 897-912.  aUSP7 is a deubiquitinase that regulates many diverse cellular processes, including tumor suppression, epigenetics, and genome stability. Several substrates, including GMPS, UHRF1, and ICP0, were shown to bear a specific KxxxK motif that interacts within the C-terminal region of USP7. We identified a similar motif in Enhancer of Zeste 2 (EZH2), the histone methyltransferase found within Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2). PRC2 is responsible for the methylation of Histone 3 Lys27 (H3K27) leading to gene silencing. GST pull-down and coimmunoprecipitation experiments showed that USP7 interacts with EZH2. We determined the structural basis of interaction between USP7 and EZH2 and identified residues mediating the interaction. Mutations in these critical residues disrupted the interaction between USP7 and EZH2. Furthermore, USP7 silencing and knockout experiments showed decreased EZH2 levels in HCT116 carcinoma cells. Finally, we demonstrated decreased H3K27Me3 levels in HCT116 USP7 knockout cells. These results indicate that USP7 interacts with EZH2 and regulates both its stability and function.  aPublisher supplied data 3aepigenetics 3agene silencing 3agenome 3ahistones 3amethylation 3amethyltransferases 3amutation 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3aprecipitin tests 3aproteinases 3aubiquitin 0ahistone modification 0adeubiquitinating enzyme 0apolycomb repressive complex 2 0aH3K271 aBojagora, Anna1 aLacdao, Ira Kay1 aLuthra, Niharika1 aPfoh, Roland1 aMohseni, Sadaf1 aChaharlangi, Danica1 aTan, Nadine1 aSaridakis, Vivian0 tJournal of molecular biology.g2020 Feb. 14, v. 432, no. 4 p.897-912dElsevier LtdwJournal:12469x0022-28367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2019.12.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02158naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002000143245009700163520123300260592002801493650001901521650001001540650001901550650002001569650001301589650001201602650001001614700002701624773011901651856007701770852000901847655001201856IND60742542420221121124820.0210624e20210616xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074254242DNAL7 a10.3390/foods100613922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRumler, Rubina 10aEffect of Sorghum on Rheology and Final Quality of Western Style Breads: A Literature Review  aDue to the extreme weather conditions, caused by the climate change, the usual wheat harvest yield and quality in the Western countries were difficult to maintain in the past few years. The altered wheat quality was primarily characterized by a rising protein content. The application of high protein wheat flours in baking products leads to baking difficulties due to its elastic dough behavior. As these issues will further face the Western cereal cultivation, heat resistant cereals, like sorghum, are attracting increasing interest. A partial substitution of wheat with sorghum might offer one possible solution to address the current challenging situation. To introduce sorghum in the Western cereal and baking industry, the grain and its unique chemical and rheological properties need to be more widely promoted. Until now, several authors have conducted studies in order to emphasize the high potential of sorghum. The aim of the present review is to broaden the current knowledge of the chemical, rheological and baking properties of sorghum in comparison to wheat. The review further demonstrates promising approaches, which might be from interest in order to achieve higher wheat-sorghum bakery end product qualities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3adough 3aheat tolerance 3aprotein content 3arheology 3aweather 3awheat1 aSchönlechner, Regine,0 tFoods.g2021 June 16, v. 10, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods100613923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01565naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245010500161300002000266520034800286592002800634650001500662650002700677650002300704650002300727650001900750650001800769650003100787650001600818650001100834700002500845700003000870700002300900700001700923700001800940773013700958856007501095852000901170655001201179IND60659074220221121004835.0190827e20110920xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065907422DNAL7 a10.1039/c1cc14019a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFigueiredo, Sara10aYeast cell wall particles: a promising class of nature-inspired microcarriers for multimodal imaging  ap. 10635-10637.  aThis communication demonstrates that yeast cell wall particles (YCWPs) are a promising class of nature-inspired biocompatible microcarriers for the delivery of amphipathic/lipophilic imaging reporters.

However, mAb397 originates from the less commonly used VH3-15 germline gene compared to the VH3-30/33 antibodies generally elicited by RTS,S to the central NANP repeat region of CSP. The crystal structure of mAb397 with an NPNA₄ peptide shows that the central NPNA forms a type I β-turn and is the main recognition motif. In most anti-NANP antibodies studied to date, a germline-encoded Trp is used to engage the Pro in NPNA β-turns, but here the Trp interacts with the first Asn. This “conserved” Trp, however, can arise from different germline genes and be located in the heavy or the light chain. Variation in the terminal ψ angles of the NPNA β-turns results in different dispositions of the subsequent NPNA and, hence, different stoichiometries and modes of antibody binding to rsCSP. Diverse protective antibodies against NANP repeats are therefore not limited to a single germline gene response or mode of binding.  aPublisher supplied data 0amalaria 0asporozoite 0aNANP repeats 0atype I β-turn 0aTrp-Asn interaction 0aPf 0aCSP 0arsCSP 0aSPZ 0amAb 0aFab 0aBSA 0aCDR 0aITC 0aBLI 0ansEM1 aGonzalez-Paez, Gonzalo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4708-57531 aOyen, David1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4324-96881 aTorres, Jonathan L.1 aFlores-Garcia, Yevel1 aMartin, Gregory M.1 aGonzález-Páez, Gonzalo E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4708-57531 aEmerling, Daniel1 aVolkmuth, Wayne1 aLocke, E.q(Emily),1 aKing, C.

In the crystal structure the silver atoms of AgBr dimers are connected to two bridging bromine atoms and two nitrogen atoms of different en ligands. The dimers are thus connected by the ligands into layers via μ-N,N’ coordination. In the 2:1 coordination polymer poly[(AgBr)₂(μ2-en-N,N’)] (II) a three-dimensional AgBr substructure occur which consists of helical AgBr chains that are connected via peripheral Ag-Br contacts into a three-dimensional network that contains large channels. The en ligands are situated in these channels bridging the Ag atoms. From solution this compound cannot be obtained as a pure phase, since compound I is always formed as the major phase. On heating the 1:1 compound I in a thermobalance the sample mass decreases slowly and several mass steps are observed, which are not fully resolved. If the reaction is stopped at 230°C, pure AgBr has formed. At 115°C only traces of compound II are found. The major phase consists of an as yet unidentified ligand poor compound.  aPublisher supplied data 3abromides 3abromine 3acoordination polymers 3acrystal structure 3adiamines 3aligands 3anitrogen 3asilver 3asilver compounds 3athermal properties 0aKeywords: Silver(I) Bromide 0aEthylenediamine 0aCoordination Polymers 0aCrystal Structures 0aThermal Properties1 aBeck, Andreas,d1948-0 tZeitschrift für Naturforschung B.g2014 June 2, v. 59, no. 9 p.992-998dVerlag der Zeitschrift für Naturforschungx1865-71177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/znb-2004-09083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01632naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245015600158300002000314520035700334592002800691650002700719650002300746650002000769650001700789650001600806650002100822650001400843650001800857650001800875700001900893700001900912700001900931700002000950700002500970700001800995773013701013856007501150852000901225655001201234IND60659074420221121004915.0190827e20110927xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065907442DNAL7 a10.1039/c1cc14024h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChun, Changho12aA facile and sensitive immunoassay for the detection of alpha-fetoprotein using gold-coated magnetic nanoparticle clusters and dynamic light scattering  ap. 11047-11049.  aA facile and sensitive immunoassay protocol for the detection of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) was developed using gold-coated iron oxide magnetic nanoclusters and dynamic light scattering (DLS) methods.

We recently engineered a protein heterodimer that dissociates when irradiated with blue light and demonstrated that by fusing each half of the dimer to termini of a protein that it is possible to selectively block binding surfaces on the protein when in the dark. On activation with light, the dimer dissociates and exposes the binding surface, allowing the protein to bind its partner. Critical to the success of this system, called Z-lock, is that the linkers connecting the dimer components to the termini are engineered so that the dimer forms over the appropriate binding surface. Here, we develop and test a protocol in the Rosetta molecular modeling program for designing linkers for Z-lock. We show that the protocol can predict the most effective linker sets for three different light-sensitive switches, including a newly designed switch that binds the Rho-family GTPase Cdc42 on stimulation with blue light. This protocol represents a generalized computational approach to placing a wide variety of proteins under optogenetic control with Z-lock.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanimals 3ablue light 3aguanosinetriphosphatase 3airradiation 3amolecular models 3aoptogenetics 3aprotein binding 3aproteins 0aprotein design 0aLOV2 domain 0arosetta 0aZ-Lock 0aLOV2 0aPA-Rac 0aPOI 0aαTAT1 aWatanabe, Takashi1 aHahn, Klaus M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1970-75621 aKuhlman, Brian0 tJournal of molecular biology.g2020 Feb. 14, v. 432, no. 4 p.805-814dElsevier LtdwJournal:12469x0022-28367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2019.12.0333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02688naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100004100143245006600184520138300250592002801633650001701661650001601678650001801694650001701712650001401729650001801743650002501761650001101786650002001797650001801817650002201835650001801857650000901875650002301884650002101907650002201928650002401950700001801974700002501992700002002017773011902037856007702156852000902233655001202242IND60742542720221121153030.0210624e20210616xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074254272DNAL7 a10.3390/foods100613952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBalasubramanian, Balamuralikrishnan 14aThe Epic of In Vitro Meat Production—A Fiction into Reality  aDue to a proportionally increasing population and food demands, the food industry has come up with wide innovations, opportunities, and possibilities to manufacture meat under in vitro conditions. The amalgamation of cell culture and tissue engineering has been the base idea for the development of the synthetic meat, and this has been proposed to be a pivotal study for a futuristic muscle development program in the medical field. With improved microbial and chemical advancements, in vitro meat matched the conventional meat and is proposed to be eco-friendly, healthy, nutrient rich, and ethical. Despite the success, there are several challenges associated with the utilization of materials in synthetic meat manufacture, which demands regulatory and safety assessment systems to manage the risks associated with the production of cultured meat. The role of 3D bioprinting meat analogues enables a better nutritional profile and sensorial values. The integration of nanosensors in the bioprocess of culture meat eased the quality assessment throughout the food supply chain and management. Multidisciplinary approaches such as mathematical modelling, computer fluid dynamics, and biophotonics coupled with tissue engineering will be promising aspects to envisage the future prospective of this technology and make it available to the public at economically feasible rates.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiophotonics 3abioprinting 3abioprocessing 3acell culture 3acomputers 3acultured meat 3aeconomic feasibility 3aethics 3afluid mechanics 3afood industry 3afood supply chain 3amanufacturing 3ameat 3amuscle development 3anutrient content 3asafety assessment 3asensors (equipment)1 aLiu, Wenchao 1 aPushparaj, Karthika 1 aPark, Sungkwon 0 tFoods.g2021 June 16, v. 10, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods100613953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03840naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024002800135040001800163100003200181245016000213300001600373506007600389520173200465592002802197506003702225650001802262650001902280650001202299650001302311650003202324650002502356650003502381650001602416650001202432650005902444650007402503650004102577650006602618650006502684650006502749650005902814653000802873653001302881653002002894653001202914653001302926653001502939700002402954700002402978700002603002773013803028856007403166961001303240852000903253655001203262IND60118938120221207050153.0141127e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011893812DNAL7 a242206542pmid7 aPMC38832922pmcid7 a10.1093/jxb/ert3642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFreitas, Sergio Tonetto de,10aCalcium partitioning and allocation and blossom-end rot development in tomato plants in response to whole-plant and fruit-specific abscisic acid treatments  ap. 235-247.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe mechanisms regulating Ca²⁺ partitioning and allocation in plants and fruit remain poorly understood. The objectives of this study were to determine Ca²⁺ partitioning and allocation in tomato plants and fruit in response to whole-plant and fruit-specific abscisic acid (ABA) treatments, as well as to analyse the effect of changes in Ca²⁺ partitioning and allocation on fruit susceptibility to the Ca²⁺ deficiency disorder blossom-end rot (BER) under water stress conditions. Tomato plants of the cultivar Ace 55 (Vf) were grown in a greenhouse and exposed to low Ca²⁺ conditions during fruit growth and development. Starting 1 day after pollination (DAP), the following treatments were initiated: (i) whole plants were sprayed weekly with deionized water (control) or (ii) with 500mg l−1 ABA; or fruit on each plant were dipped weekly (iii) in deionized water (control) or (iv) in 500mg l−1 ABA. At 15 DAP, BER was completely prevented by whole-plant or fruit-specific ABA treatments, whereas plants or fruit treated with water had 16–19% BER incidence. At 30 DAP, BER was prevented by the whole-plant ABA treatment, whereas fruit dipped in ABA had a 16% and water-treated plants or fruit had a 36–40% incidence of BER. The results showed that spraying the whole plant with ABA increases xylem sap flow and Ca²⁺ movement into the fruit, resulting in higher fruit tissue and water-soluble apoplastic Ca²⁺ concentrations that prevent BER development. Although fruit-specific ABA treatment had no effect on xylem sap flow rates or Ca²⁺ movement into the fruit, it increased fruit tissue water-soluble apoplastic Ca²⁺ concentrations and reduced fruit susceptibility to BER to a lesser extent.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aabscisic acid 3aacid treatment 3acalcium 3atomatoes 2aAbscisic Acidxpharmacology 2aBiological Transport 2aCalciumxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aDehydration 2aFlowers 2aFruitxdrug effectsxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aSolanum lycopersicumxdrug effectsxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aPlant Diseasesxprevention & control 2aPlant Leavesxdrug effectsxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aPlant Rootsxdrug effectsxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aPlant Stemsxdrug effectsxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aXylemxdrug effectsxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 0aABA 0aapoplast 0ablossom-end rot 0aleakage 0amembrane 0axylem sap.1 aMcElrone, Andrew J.1 aShackel, Kenneth A.1 aMitcham, Elizabeth J.0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2014 Jan., v. 65, no. 1 p.235-247dOxford University Press [etc.]wJournal:jnl44658x0022-09577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/ert3643Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02428naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245009800173300001600271520102200287592002801309650001201337650001801349650002401367650001501391650001001406650001501416650001001431650002201441650001201463653000901475653001701484653002801501653002501529653001601554653001701570653003201587653002101619653002801640653001401668700001701682700002301699700001901722700002101741773011201762856005101874852000901925655001201934IND50088098020221119084024.0140412e20121201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008809802DNAL7 a10.1080/14772000.2012.7534882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStahlhut, Julie K.10aWolbachia (Rickettsiales) infections and bee (Apoidea) barcoding: a response to Gerth et al.  ap. 395-401.  aIn a recent Perspective, Gerth et al. (2011) expressed concern over how Wolbachia (Wolbachia pipientis Hertig) infections may affect the success of DNA barcoding efforts in bees. The potential and realized effects of endosymbiont-induced selective sweeps on host mitochondrial DNA diversity have been noted repeatedly – and rightly so – in the literature for some years. However, we are equally concerned with other misconceptions, including (a) presuming that a positive Wolbachia test indicates a stable infection, (b) presuming that Wolbachia-infected hosts cannot be identified with a single-locus barcode, and (c) inferring specific Wolbachia–mtDNA interactions based only on incomplete genotyping of Wolbachia strains. We address these issues in the context of the Gerth et al. (2011) survey of Wolbachia prevalence among the German bee fauna. We also clarify some of the context-dependent strengths and limitations of DNA barcoding when it is used as a research tool by taxonomists and ecologists.  aPublisher supplied data 3aApoidea 3aDNA barcoding 3aWolbachia pipientis 3aecologists 3afauna 3agenotyping 3ahosts 3amitochondrial DNA 3asurveys 0abees 0aDNA barcodes 0ahorizontal transmission 0ahybrid introgression 0aHymenoptera 0amitochondria 0a multi-locus strain typing 0aselective sweeps 0a vertical transmission 0aWolbachia1 aGibbs, Jason1 aSheffield, Cory S.1 aAlex Smith, M.1 aPacker, Laurence0 tSystematics and biodiversity.g2012 Dec. 1, v. 10, no. 4 p.395-401dTaylor & Francis Groupx1478-09337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14772000.2012.753488  aDNAL 7aarticle01074naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001800138245005200156300001800208520021400226592002800440650002300468650001400491650001400505650001300519700002300532700001800555773012900573856007300702852000900775655001200784IND60657590420221120103657.0190816e20041129xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065759042DNAL7 a10.1039/b412056f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNath, Manashi10aChemical routes to GeS₂ and GeSe₂ nanowires  ap. 2698-2699.  aNanowires of GeS₂ and GeSe₂ have been obtained by novel chemical routes involving the decomposition of organo-ammonium precursors containing super-tetrahedral Ge₄S₁₀ and the dimeric Ge₂Se₆ units.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical reactions 3ananowires 3aselenides 3asulfides1 aChoudhury, Amitava1 aRao, C.

In this approach, an ontology-based image annotation and retrieval is developed to support the CBIR. Using ontology in combination with CBIR reduces the number of images needed in the training set, utilizing the provided user parameters.

Ces. et de Not.] is distributed worldwide, resulting in a serious crop loss every year in apple (Malus domestica Borkh.) production. The resistance of each seedling derived from a hybrid population (JonathanxGolden Delicious) was evaluated by disease index either from natural infection in the field or from inoculation with five isolates of B. dothidea, Ls1, Lw023, Lw048, Mx1, and Zz26. The inheritance of the resistance to bot canker was analyzed via frequency distribution analysis, and microsatellite and AFLP markers linked to the resistance loci were screened. From the binary frequency distribution patterns, it was found that the segregation ratio of resistant/susceptible genotypes infected by pathogen isolates Lw023 and Ls1 was 1:15; and that by Zz26 and Mx1 was 15:1. The variation of resistance was involved in the segregation of two to four alleles of major genes, the resistance was recessive when infected by Lw023 and Ls1, but was dominant when infected with Mx1 and Zz26. A microsatellite maker, CH02a04-450, and two AFLP markers, E-AG/M-GAC-280 and E-AGG/M-CTT-110, were identified, and their map distances to the resistance loci were 5.1, 5.1 and 6.2 cM, respectively. The three markers are located in different linkage groups, while CH02a04-450 is on linkage group 2 or 7. E-AG/M-GAC-280 was successfully converted into SCAR159. Finally, CH02a04-450 and SCAR159 were re-examined in inoculated segregation population and presented a good reliability on predicting phenotypes of resistance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBotryosphaeria dothidea 3aMalus domestica 3aalleles 3aamplified fragment length polymorphism 3aapples 3acrop losses 3agenotype 3ahybrids 3alinkage groups 3aloci 3amajor genes 3amicrosatellite repeats 3apathogens 3aphenotype 3aprediction 3aseedlings1 aLI, Cai-li1 aZHANG, Yu-jing1 aLI, Chun-min1 aZHAO, Yong-bo1 aCHEN, Dong-mei1 aWang, Yi,1 aZHANG, Xin-zhong1 aHAN, Zhen-hai0 tAgricultural sciences in China.g2011 Feb., v. 10, no. 2 p.175-184dElsevier B.V.x1671-29277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1671-2927(09)60304-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02339naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100006500181245006500246300001600311506007600327520100300403592002801406506003701434650002601471650002601497650001301523650002501536650001701561650001801578650001401596650002101610700001901631700002001650700002001670700002401690773013201714856007401846852000901920655001201929IND60626932320221207121723.0190128e20190121xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062693232DNAL7 a10.1039/c7cs00748e2doi7 aPMC63407592pmcid7 a304621122pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuptaA.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recently stated that the world is on the verge of entering the “post-antibiotic era”, one where more people will die from bacterial infections than from cancer. Recently, nanoparticles (NPs) have emerged as new tools that can be used to combat deadly bacterial infections. Nanoparticle-based strategies can overcome the barriers faced by traditional antimicrobials, including antibiotic resistance. In this tutorial review, we have highlighted multiple nanoparticle-based approaches to eliminate bacterial infections, providing crucial insight into the design of elements that play critical roles in creating antimicrobial nanotherapeutics. In particular, we have focused on the pivotal role played by NP-surface functionality in designing nanomaterials as self-therapeutic agents and delivery vehicles for antimicrobial cargo.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanti-infective agents 3aantibiotic resistance 3abacteria 3abacterial infections 3ahuman health 3ananoparticles 3aneoplasms 3avirulent strains1 aMumtaz, Shazia1 aLi, Cheng-Hsuan1 aHussain, Irshad1 aRotello, Vincent M.0 tChemical Society reviews.g2019 Jan. 21, v. 48, no. 2 p.415-427dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:20471x1460-47447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7cs00748e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle
