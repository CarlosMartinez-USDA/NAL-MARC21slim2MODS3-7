Previous studies of our group have demonstrated the anti-inflammatory and antimycobacterial action of the ethanolic extract of Doliocarpus dentatus (EEDd) as well as the safety of its use.we investigated the effects of EEDd on reproductive performance, fetal development and DNA integrity in pregnant female Swiss mice.thirty female Swiss mice were divided into three experimental groups (n = 10): control group treated with 1% tween-80 and EEDd1 and EEDd2 groups treated with EEDd at doses of 100 and 1000 mg/kg, respectively. The treatment occurred by oral gavage throughout the gestational period. At the end of pregnancy, parameters related to reproductive performance, embryofoetal development and DNA integrity was evaluated.both doses of the extract tested did not alter the reproductive parameters, did not present significant differences in the embryofetal development when compared to the control group and also did not induce the formation of micronuclei.the EEDd do not alter the reproductive parameters, embryofetal development and DNA integrity, ensuring its safe use during pregnancy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDilleniaceae 3afemales 3afetal development 3agestation period 3amice 3apain 3apolysorbates 3apregnancy 3areproductive performance 3atraditional medicine 3aBrazil 0aDoliocarpus dentatus 0aTeratogenesis 0aReproductive toxicology1 aVani, Juliana Miron1 adas Neves, Silvia Cordeiro1 aRabacow, Ana Paula Maluf1 aKassuya, Cândida Aparecida Leite1 aCroda, Júlio1 aCardoso, Claudia Andrea Lima1 aMonreal, Antônio Carlos Duenhas Ferreira1 aAntoniolli, Andreia Conceição Milan Brochado1 aCunha – Laura, Andréa Luiza1 aOliveira, Rodrigo Juliano0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2018 May 10, v. 217 p.1-6dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl30651x0378-87417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2018.01.0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01736naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002100143245028900164300001800453520051000471592002800981650001201009650001301021650001201034653002201046653003101068653001501099653001801114653001901132700002001151773015301171856007701324852000901401655001201410IND60521482820221119114806.0160530e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052148282DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1976-12212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHerrmann, Rupert10aZum Mechanismus der Substituentenwechselwirkung bei der elektronenstoßinduzierten Äther-Spaltung in para-substituierten Methoxymethylaromaten / On the Mechanism of Substituent Interaction During the Electron Impact Induced Ether Cleavage from para-Substituted Methoxymethyl Benzenes  ap. 1667-1672.  aThe unusual methyl elimination from para-substituted methoxy-methyl benzenes has been elucidated.

Scientific literature published from the last two decades was reviewed and data were collected to establish the ranges of Campylobacter loads from different samples. Results showed that the pathogen load in the sample is likely to increase from the different stages of the production chain. Contamination of water and feed represents the most notable source of contamination during the primary production, while cross-contamination of broiler carcasses, skin, and meat occurs during the slaughter, dressing, and processing via machinery, work surfaces, water, and air partially due to the leaking of contaminated feces from visceral rupture. Knowledge gaps were identified and included: a lack of studies detecting Campylobacter in broilers in most of the European countries over the last decade and a low number of studies determining the bacterial load in crates used to transport broilers to the slaughterhouse. Determining the prevalence of Campylobacter in the broiler industry will enable us to set critical control points to produce broiler flocks and meat products with a low risk of Campylobacter contamination.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCampylobacter 3aair 3achicken industry 3across contamination 3adigestive system 3afeces 3afood microbiology 3ameat 3amicrobial ecology 3amicrobial load 3apoultry production 3aprimary productivity 3arisk 3aslaughter 3aslaughterhouses 3awater pollution 0aMicrobiota 0aChicken 0aBacteriophage 0aBiocontrol 0aPoultry 0aPublic health risk1 aLis, Lukas1 aLasagabaster, Amaia1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4680-33141 aNafarrate, Ibai1 aFerrocino, Ilario1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1657-00541 aCocolin, Luca1 aRantsiou, Kalliopi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5649-608X0 tFood microbiology.g2022 June, v. 104 p.103998-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34976x0740-00207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fm.2022.1039983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02576naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245013100168300001600299520124700315592002801562650001301590650002001603650001501623650001901638650001601657650003101673650001801704650000901722650002101731650002601752650001401778653001301792653003001805653001501835653002201850653002301872653001801895700001701913700001801930773008901948856008402037852000902121655001202130IND60600456320221121221615.0180703e20140601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060045632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2014.03.1062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWei, Liangjie10aEffect of n-pentanol addition on the combustion, performance and emission characteristics of a direct-injection diesel engine  ap. 172-180.  aIn this study, experiments were conducted to examine the effect of using a mixture of diesel and n-pentanol, which is one of the second-generation biofuels with comparable properties to diesel fuel, as fuel on the combustion, performance, and gaseous and particulate emissions of a naturally-aspirated, four-cylinder, direct-injection diesel engine. Three n-pentanol fractions in the fuel mixture were selected: 10, 20 and 30% by volume. Results show that, the addition of n-pentanol leads to longer ignition delay and increases the peak heat release rate in the premixed combustion phase. The brake specific fuel consumption increases with increase of n-pentanol, while the brake thermal efficiency is not affected. Regarding the gaseous emissions, n-pentanol addition results in the following consequence: (a) HC (hydrocarbon) and CO (carbon monoxide) emissions increase for 30% n-pentanol in the blended fuel at low engine load but decrease at high engine load; (b) a slight increase (maximum 8%) in NOx emissions but noticeable increase in NO2 emissions. Regarding the particulate emissions, n-pentanol is found to be very promising in terms of reducing both the mass concentration and the particulate number concentration simultaneously.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiofuels 3acarbon monoxide 3acombustion 3adiesel engines 3adiesel fuel 3aenergy use and consumption 3agas emissions 3aheat 3anitrogen dioxide 3aparticulate emissions 3apentanols 0aPentanol 0aSecond-generation biofuel 0aCombustion 0aGaseous emissions 0aParticle emissions 0aDiesel engine1 aCheung, C.S.1 aHuang, Zuohua0 tEnergy.g2014 June 01, v. 70 p.172-180dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2014.03.1063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02706naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092024002200127024001900149040001800168100002500186245015800211300001600369506007600385520146700461592002801928506003701956650001201993650001202005650002202017650001502039650002302054650001202077650002202089650002202111650001702133700002202150773009102172856004802263852000902311655001202320IND4474825320221207141724.0120418e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447482532DNAL7 a10.1007/s10980-012-9730-72doi7 aPMC44268882pmcid7 a259833922pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVan Berkel, Derek B.10aCombining exploratory scenarios and participatory backcasting: using an agent-based model in participatory policy design for a multi-functional landscape  ap. 641-658.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWhile the merits of local participatory policy design are widely recognised, limited use is made of model-based scenario results to inform such stakeholder involvement. In this paper we present the findings of a study using an agent based model to help stakeholders consider, discuss and incorporate spatial and temporal processes in a backcasting exercise for rural development. The study is carried out in the Dutch region called the Achterhoek. Region-specific scenarios were constructed based on interviews with local experts. The scenarios are simulated in an agent based model incorporating rural residents and farmer characteristics, the environment and different policy interventions for realistic projection of landscape evolution. Results of the model simulations were presented to stakeholders representing different rural sectors at a workshop. The results indicate that illustration of the spatial configuration of landscape changes is appreciated by stakeholders. Testing stakeholdersâ solutions by way of model simulations revealed that the effectiveness of local interventions is strongly related to exogenous processes such as market competition and endogenous processes like local willingness to engage in multifunctional activities. The integration of multi-agent modelling and participatory backcasting is effective as it offers a possibility to initiate discussion between experts and stakeholders bringing together different expertise.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aexperts 3afarmers 3aissues and policy 3alandscapes 3amarket competition 3amarkets 3arural development 3asimulation models 3astakeholders1 aVerburg, Peter H.0 tLandscape ecology.g2012 May, v. 27, no. 5 p.641-658dSpringer-Verlagx0921-29737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10980-012-9730-7  aDNAL 7aarticle03873naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005300153245013100206300001800337500001900355520241700374592002802791650002202819650001102841650001902852650001502871650001102886650001402897650001202911650002002923650001502943650000902958650001702967650001402984650001602998650001303014650001003027650001703037650002503054700001403079700001403093700001403107700005503121773011903176856008703295852000903382655001203391IND60740609620221119153904.0210603e20210520xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074060962DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.1c008112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Rui1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7864-172710aPore Structure Characterization and Reservoir Quality Evaluation of Analcite-Rich Shale Oil Reservoir from the Bohai Bay Basin  ap. 9349-9368.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPore characteristics and shale oil reservoir quality strongly influences the petroleum occurrence, enrichment, and economic production. In this work, to characterize the pore system and evaluate the reservoir quality of analcite-rich shale oil reservoir, a total of 33 shale samples from the second member of the Paleogcene Kongdian Formation (Ek₂) of Bohai Bay Basin were examined using a suite of techniques, including total organic carbon (TOC) content, X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission SEM, gas (CO₂ and N₂) physisorption, and mercury injection porosimetry (MIP). Six typical shale lithofacies are identified, and their pore characteristics are compared to reveal the factors affecting shale reservoir quality. The mineral matrix-related pore (e.g., intergranular and intragranular pores) is the dominant pore type in different shale lithofacies, with few organic matter (OM)-hosted pores being observed. Analcite-rich siliceous shale exhibits the largest specific surface area (SSA) and micropore volume, while the smallest is observed in analcite-rich mixed shale lithofacies. In contrast, the volume and SSA values of mesopores for siliceous shale are the largest, while mixed shale has the smallest values. Multipermeabilities of five connected pore networks were determined using the Katz-Thompson equation, and the permeability of microfractures or interlayer bedding cracks is at the micro-Darcy scale, as reflected by the first two inflection points. Permeability values for the other three inflection points reflect the matrix pore system within a nano-Darcy range. Siliceous shale has the high matrix permeability and good pore connectivity, which is favorable for fluid flow. Authigenic analcite mineral has different effects on pore development and reservoir quality depending on the shale mineral composition and diagenesis processes. Some primary pores were lost during the filling of analcite mineral in the early diagenesis period, but some intergranular pores were also protected by the rigid framework formed by analcite minerals. In addition, some secondary dissolution pores are generated during the reaction between analcite and organic acids discharged from the source rocks within the oil generation window, and the reservoir porosity and permeability can be greatly improved. Except for analcite, the TOC content is also an important factor controlling reservoir quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3abasins 3acarbon dioxide 3adiagenesis 3aenergy 3aequations 3amercury 3amineral content 3aoil fields 3aoils 3apermeability 3apetroleum 3aporosimetry 3aporosity 3ashale 3asurface area 3atotal organic carbon1 aJia, Aoqi1 aHe, Sheng1 aWang, Tao1 aHu, Qinhong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4782-319X0 tEnergy & fuels.g2021 May 20, v. 35, no. 11 p.9349-9368dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.1c008113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04272naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003200135040001800167100002300185245012100208300001200329506007600341520221800417592002802635506003702663650001102700650001902711650001802730650002002748650001902768650002502787650002202812650002302834650002302857650001702880650001002897650001102907650002202918650004202940650001102982650002302993650002003016650002503036650000903061650001603070650001903086650002403105650003203129650001603161650001903177650002603196651001103222651001103233700002103244700003003265700002003295700002003315700002503335700002303360773016103383856004503544852000903589655001203598IND50058752520221207145054.0201006e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5005875252DNAL7 a217911052pmid7 aPMC31997352pmcid7 a10.1186/1479-5868-8-772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOliveira, Aldair J10aSocial support and leisure-time physical activity: longitudinal evidence from the Brazilian Pró-Saúde cohort study  ap. 476.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Although social support has been observed to exert a beneficial influence on leisure-time physical activity (LTPA), multidimensional approaches examining social support and prospective evidence of its importance are scarce. The purpose of this study was to investigate how four dimensions of social support affect LTPA engagement, maintenance, type, and time spent by adults during a two-year follow-up. METHODS: This paper reports on a longitudinal study of 3,253 non-faculty public employees at a university in Rio de Janeiro (the Pró-Saúde study). LTPA was evaluated using a dichotomous question with a two-week reference period, and further questions concerning LTPA type (individual or group) and time spent on the activity. Social support was measured by the Medical Outcomes Study Social Support Scale (MOS-SSS). To assess the association between social support and LTPA, two different statistical models were used: binary and multinomial logistic regression models for dichotomous and polytomous outcomes, respectively. Models were adjusted separately for those who began LTPA in the middle of the follow up (engagement group) and for those who had maintained LTPA since the beginning of the follow up (maintenance group). RESULTS: After adjusting for confounders, statistically significant associations (p < 0.05) between dimensions of social support and group LTPA were found in the engagement group. Also, the emotional/information dimension was associated with time spent on LTPA (OR = 2.01; 95% CI 1.2-3.9). In the maintenance group, material support was associated with group LTPA (OR = 1.80; 95% CI; 1.1-3.1) and the positive social interaction dimension was associated with time spent on LTPA (OR = 1.65; 95% CI; 1.1-2.7). CONCLUSIONS: All dimensions of social support influenced LTPA type or the time spent on the activity. However, our findings suggest that social support is more important in engagement than in maintenance. This finding is important, because it suggests that maintenance of LTPA must be associated with other factors beyond the individual's level of social support, such as a suitable environment and social/health policies directed towards the practice of LTPA.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadults 3acohort studies 3ahealth policy 3ahuman resources 3alogit analysis 3alongitudinal studies 3aphysical activity 3asocial environment 3astatistical models 3auniversities 2aAdult 2aFemale 2aFollow-Up Studies 2aHealth Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice 2aHumans 2aLeisure Activities 2aLogistic Models 2aLongitudinal Studies 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aMotor Activity 2aProspective Studies 2aSurveys and Questionnaires. 2aSelf Report 2aSocial Support 2aSocioeconomic Factors 3aBrazil 0aBrazil1 aLopes, Claudia S1 ade Leon, Antônio C Ponce1 aRostila, Mikael1 aGriep, Rosane H1 aWerneck, Guilherme L1 aFaerstein, Eduardo0 tinternational journal of behavioral nutrition and physical activity.g2011 Dec., v. 8, no. 1 p.476-476dSpringer-VerlagwJournal:jnl4350546x1479-58687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1479-5868-8-77  aDNAL 7aarticle03629naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005900150245012700209300002000336520172200356592002802078650002502106650002002131650002602151650002202177650005002199700006802249700006302317700005802380700005902438700006002497700002502557700002402582700002402606700002402630700005802654700002302712700006002735700006202795700002402857700006602881773013102947856008403078852000903162655001203171IND60748855420220218000000.0210827e20210812xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074885542DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.1c023482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAalizadeh, Reza1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9167-906010aDevelopment and Application of Liquid Chromatographic Retention Time Indices in HRMS-Based Suspect and Nontarget Screening  ap. 11601-11611.  aThere is an increasing need for comparable and harmonized retention times (tR) in liquid chromatography (LC) among different laboratories, to provide supplementary evidence for the identity of compounds in high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS)-based suspect and nontarget screening investigations. In this study, a rigorously tested, flexible, and less system-dependent unified retention time index (RTI) approach for LC is presented, based on the calibration of the elution pattern. Two sets of 18 calibrants were selected for each of ESI+ and ESI-based on the maximum overlap with the retention times and chemical similarity indices from a total set of 2123 compounds. The resulting calibration set, with RTI set to range between 1 and 1000, was proposed as the most appropriate RTI system after rigorous evaluation, coordinated by the NORMAN network. The validation of the proposed RTI system was done externally on different instrumentation and LC conditions. The RTI can also be used to check the reproducibility and quality of LC conditions. Two quantitative structure–retention relationship (QSRR)-based models were built based on the developed RTI systems, which assist in the removal of false-positive annotations. The applicability domains of the QSRR models allowed completing the identification process with higher confidence for substances within the domain, while indicating those substances for which results should be treated with caution. The proposed RTI system was used to improve confidence in suspect and nontarget screening and increase the comparability between laboratories as demonstrated for two examples. All RTI-related calculations can be performed online at http://rti.chem.uoa.gr/.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical chemistry 3ainstrumentation 3aliquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3aquantitative structure-activity relationships1 aAlygizakis, Nikiforos A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5727-49991 aSchymanski, Emma L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6868-81451 aKrauss, Martin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0362-42441 aSchulze, Tobias1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9744-89141 aIbáñez, María1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4930-89331 aMcEachran, Andrew D.1 aChao, Alexander Wu,1 aWilliams, Antony J.1 aGago-Ferrero, Pablo1 aCovaci, Adrian1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0527-11361 aMoschet, Christoph1 aYoung, Thomas M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7217-47531 aHollender, Juliane1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4660-274X1 aSlobodnik, Jaroslav1 aThomaidis, Nikolaos S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4624-47350 tAnalytical chemistry.g2021 Aug. 12, v. 93, no. 33 p.11601-11611dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.1c023483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01567naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245006400168300001800232520069200250592002800942650001300970650001800983650002401001650001101025650001201036700001701048773012201065856008101187852000901268655001201277IND60627426420221117021225.0190128e200810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062742642DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-008-2695-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDavies, G.

By looking at many benchmarks (including an industrial component) with experimental validation, it is concluded that simulation is now a feasible design tool and that many more searching examples will lend credibility to this strategy for both manufacturers and certification authorities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaircraft 3acertification 3acomposite materials 3amodels 3aphysics1 aAnkersen, J.0 tJournal of materials science.g2008 Oct., v. 43, no. 20 p.6586-6592dSpringer USwJournal:jnl4392857x0022-24617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-008-2695-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02630naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245010100172300001400273520113100287592002801418650002201446650002301468650003701491650001501528650001501543650001401558650003301572650002501605650002401630650003701654653001401691653002801705653002301733653001501756653002501771700002701796700002601823700002801849700001801877700002501895700001501920700002401935773009801959856008202057852000902139655001202148IND60623221820221119003108.0210121e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062322182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tca.2018.11.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarbajal-Valdéz, R.10aExperimental investigation on thermal properties of Ag nanowire nanofluids at low concentrations  ap. 83-88.  aNew nanofluids containing Ag nanowires with different concentrations were prepared by chemical reduction method. The metallic nanowires were monodispersed and soluble in distilled water. Thermal properties of nanofluids containing Ag nanowires were obtained using photothermal techniques. The thermal-wave resonator cavity (TWRC) technique was used to obtain the samples’ thermal diffusivity. Open Photoacoustic Cell (OPC) technique was used to obtain the thermal effusivity of Ag nanowires. The thermal diffusivity and effusivity were obtained by fitting the theoretical expressions for each configuration as a function of the sample thickness and frequency to the experimental data. The thermal properties of the nanofluids seems to be strongly dependent of Ag nanowire concentration. It was observed an increase of thermal parameters when concentration of nanowires increased. Thermal conductivity behavior of the nanofluids is explained. UV–vis spectroscopy, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques were used to characterize the nanofluids.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3achemical reduction 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3ananofluids 3ananosilver 3ananowires 3ascanning electron microscopy 3athermal conductivity 3athermal diffusivity 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 0aNanowires 0aPhotothermal techniques 0aThermal parameters 0aNanofluids 0atHermal conductivity1 aRodríguez-Juárez, A.1 aJiménez-Pérez, J.L.1 aSánchez-Ramírez, J.F.1 aCruz-Orea, A.1 aCorrea-Pacheco, Z.N.1 aMacias, M.1 aLuna-Sánchez, J.L.0 tThermochimica acta.g2019 Jan., v. 671 p.83-88dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11747x0040-60317nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tca.2018.11.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01448naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245015300160300002000313520041500333592002800748650002400776650002000800650002100820650001300841700001800854700001900872700001900891700001700910773012400927856007401051852000901125655001201134IND60667217320221119225757.0190919e20150206xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066721732DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra15988h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Cheng-Long10aTwo-phase mixture model for substrate degradation and photo-hydrogen production in an entrapped-cell photobioreactor under various light intensities  ap. 16759-16764.  aA two-phase mixture model was developed for revealing the interaction between substrate degradation and photo-hydrogen production in an entrapped-cell photobioreactor under various light intensities.

In this study, NiO/TiO₂ modified ZnTiO₃ perovskite (NTZ) with high reducibility catalyst was designated by co-precipitation method and examined in the reaction of steam reforming of phenol (SRP) for H₂ production. The activity tests for SRP were carried out in a fixed bed reactor (FBR) under different operating conditions. The NTZ-composite consisting of NiO/TiO₂ loaded ZnTiO₃ perovskite achieved the highest yield of H₂ and phenol conversion of ~76 and 90%, respectively, with excellent durability and time on stream (50 h) stability without obvious deactivation. The high exposed active sites of NiO/TiO₂ metals over the bi-metal support (ZnTiO₃) and the metal-support interaction significantly improved the catalytic performance. The products distribution of H₂, CO₂, and CO as a measure of the dominant reactions; SRP, water gas shift (WGS), and reverse water gas shift (RWGS) were correlated to kinetic models and developed according to Langmuir-Hinshelwood-Hougen-Watson (LHHW) expressions. LHHW model accurately fitting the experimental results with surface reactions as the kinetic limitations. SRP reaction revealed the highest rate constant of 21.70 mol g-cat⁻¹ h⁻¹ atm⁻¹ with 39.96 kJ mol⁻¹ activation energy. NTZ is a promising catalyst for the SRP reaction toward H₂ production with minimum kinetic limitations and would be promising in the clean energy production and other environmental applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivation energy 3acarbon dioxide 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3aclean energy 3acombustion 3acoprecipitation 3adurability 3aheat 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen production 3akinetics 3amodels 3aphenol 3asteam 3astreams 3azinc 0aHydrogen production 0aKinetic model 0aPhenol 0aSteam reforming technology 0aZinc titanate perovskite1 aṬāhir, Muḥammad,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2937-56450 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 Aug. 15, v. 311 p.127519-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1275193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05224naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245011600164300001600280520364800296592002803944650002403972650001303996650001204009650001204021650001404033650002004047650002004067650001304087650001804100650001504118650001004133650001404143650001404157650001104171650001704182650001804199650001404217650001704231650003304248650001404281650001104295650001204306650001104318650001204329650001404341650001104355650001104366651001104377651001704388700001604405773010004421856008104521990002304602852000904625655001204634IND60099316220221119192239.0141105e20130315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009931622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gca.2012.11.0452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKatz, Amitai10aCalcium, magnesium and strontium cycling in stratified, hardwater lakes: Lake Kinneret (Sea of Galilee), Israel  ap. 372-394.  aIn stratified hardwater lakes, calcite crystallization in the epilimnion and partial dissolution in the hypolimnion play important roles in the cycling of Ca²⁺ in the water column. Mg²⁺ and Sr²⁺ coprecipitate with this mineral, to be released together with Ca²⁺ upon its dissolution. Here, we focus on Lake Kinneret (Sea of Galilee, Israel), a stratified, warm, hardwater lake, searching for an interpretable, high resolution picture of the processes that drive Ca²⁺, Mg²⁺ and Sr²⁺cycling in this and similar lakes elsewhere. In total, 1428 water samples were collected from the lake, and another 81 samples were collected from the Jordan River and two small streams discharging into it, covering a full monomictic cycle from December 2001 through March 2003. Particulate material was retrieved from sediment traps in the hypolimnion. The water samples were analyzed for Na⁺, K⁺, Mg²⁺, Ca²⁺, Sr²⁺, Cl⁻, SO₄ ²⁻, HCO₃ ⁻ and Br⁻, and the trapped particulates were examined under SEM and analyzed for their Ca, Mg, and Sr content. Individual calcite crystals within the particulate material underwent LA-ICP-MS analysis for Ca, Mg, and Sr. Downward transport of Ca²⁺ involves crystallization of calcite in the epilimnion, followed by its settling through the water column, followed by its partial dissolution in the hypolimnion. Magnesium and Sr²⁺ follow Ca²⁺ by coprecipitation in calcite and are released upon its dissolution in the hypolimnion. Upward cycling of the three solutes occurs through an admixture of the hypolimnetic water into the epilimnion during thermocline deepening, terminated by overturn of the lake. Removal rates of Mg²⁺ and Sr²⁺ from the lake, relative to that of Ca²⁺, and the water–calcite distribution coefficients, DMg and DSᵣ, were calculated from the analyses using: (1) epilimnion water and ‘bulk’ particulates; (2) epilimnion water only; and (3) epilimnion water and calcite crystals in the particulates. The DSᵣ values obtained were internally consistent (0.194±5.9%, 0.22–0.28, and 0.204–0.232, respectively); however, the DMg value for the ‘bulk’ particulates (0.0477) was ∼6 times higher than that corresponding to calcite crystals included therein (0.00841). This difference is attributed to phytoplankton debris in the ‘bulk’ particulates and should be of concern to geochemists using Mg/Ca ratios in limestone to reconstruct ancient aquatic environments. The cycling of Ca²⁺, Mg²⁺ and Sr²⁺ in the stratified lake is monitored by Mg/Ca vs. Sr/Ca regression diagrams, where each line represents the water column composition on a specific date. The distance of the data points from the initial (mixed lake) coordinates reflects the fractionation of Ca²⁺, Mg²⁺ and Sr²⁺ after the onset of stratification. The regression lines rotate in an orderly anticlockwise direction in response to the high calcite flux from the epilimnion in spring and the higher rate of Mg²⁺ replenishment than that of Sr²⁺, compensating for their loss in calcite. The release of Mg²⁺ and Sr²⁺ from dissolving calcite in the hypolimnion, at an Mg/Sr ratio (7.5eq/eq) much lower than that in the surrounding water (∼160eq/eq), lends additional support to the anticlockwise rotation. Reversal of rotation occurs in summer, when calcite crystallization and the freshwater supply slow down, and brackish and saline water sources take control over the Mg/Sr ratio in the lake. Subsequent turnover and mixing of the lake in winter reset the Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca ratios to their original values before the next stratification.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquatic environment 3abromides 3acalcite 3acalcium 3achlorides 3acoprecipitation 3acrystallization 3acrystals 3afractionation 3afreshwater 3alakes 3alimestone 3amagnesium 3amixing 3aparticulates 3aphytoplankton 3apotassium 3asaline water 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asediments 3asodium 3asolutes 3aspring 3astreams 3astrontium 3asummer 3awinter 3aIsrael 3aJordan River1 aNishri, Ami0 tGeochimica et cosmochimica acta.g2013 Mar. 15, v. 105 p.372-394dElsevier Ltdx0016-70377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gca.2012.11.0453Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03064naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245012100169300001600290520164000306592002801946650001301974650001901987650001302006650002002019650002302039650001802062650001102080650001802091650002402109650002202133650001502155650002002170650002002190650001302210653001502223653002102238653002202259653002002281653002902301653001302330700001602343700002302359773010502382856008602487852000902573655001202582IND60531196020221118085258.0190318e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053119602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2016.04.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Chin-Lung10aEvapotranspiration from drained wetlands with different hydrologic regimes: Drivers, modeling, and storage functions  ap. 416-428.  aWe tested whether the current understanding of insignificant effect of drainage on evapotranspiration (ET) in the temperate region wetlands applies to those in the subtropics. Hydro-climatic drivers causing the changes in drained wetlands were identified and used to develop a generic model to predict wetland ET. Eddy covariance (EC)-based ET measurements were made for two years at two differently drained but close by wetlands, a heavily drained wetland (SW) (97% reduced surface storage) and a more functional wetland (DW) (42% reduced storage). Annual ET for more intensively drained SW was 836mm, 34% less than DW (1271mm) and the difference was significant (p=0.001). This difference was mainly due to drainage driven differences in inundation and associated effects on net radiation (Rn) and local relative humidity. Two generic daily ET models, a regression model (MSE=0.44mm2, R2=0.80) and a machine learning-based Relevance Vector Machine (RVM) model (MSE=0.36mm2, R2=0.84), were developed with the latter being more robust. The RVM model can predict changes in ET for different restoration scenarios; a 1.1m rise in drainage level showed 7% increase ET (18mm) at SW while the increase at DW was negligible. The additional ET, 28% of surface flow, can enhance water storage, flood protection, and climate mitigation services at SW compared to DW. More intensely drained wetlands at higher elevation should be targeted for restoration for enhanced storage through increased ET. The models developed can predict changes in ET for improved evaluation of basin-scale effects of restoration programs and climate change scenarios.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaltitude 3aclimate change 3adrainage 3aeddy covariance 3aevapotranspiration 3aflood control 3amodels 3aoverland flow 3aregression analysis 3arelative humidity 3asubtropics 3asurface storage 3atemperate zones 3awetlands 0aInundation 0aFlood protection 0aWetland hydration 0aEddy covariance 0aRelevance vector machine 0aMIKE SHE1 aShukla, S.,1 aShrestha, Niroj K.0 tJournal of hydrology.g2016 July, v. 538 p.416-428dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2016.04.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02524naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002100141245013800162500001400300520136100314592002801675650000901703650001701712650001201729650001101741650001601752650001301768650001601781650001301797650002001810650001701830700002201847700001601869700002201885773015901907856007502066852000902141655001202150IND60711727520221118110440.0200928e20200821xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071172752DNAL7 a10.3390/ijgi90904972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLawrence, Haydn 14aThe Spatial-Comprehensiveness (S-COM) Index: Identifying Optimal Spatial Extents in Volunteered Geographic Information Point Datasets  aNAL-light  aSocial media and other forms of volunteered geographic information (VGI) are used frequently as a source of fine-grained big data for research. While employing geographically referenced social media data for a wide array of purposes has become commonplace, the relevant scales over which these data apply to is typically unknown. For researchers to use VGI appropriately (e.g., aggregated to areal units (e.g., neighbourhoods) to elicit key trend or demographic information), general methods for assessing the quality are required, particularly, the explicit linkage of data quality and relevant spatial scales, as there are no accepted standards or sampling controls. We present a data quality metric, the Spatial-comprehensiveness Index (S-COM), which can delineate feasible study areas or spatial extents based on the quality of uneven and dynamic geographically referenced VGI. This scale-sensitive approach to analyzing VGI is demonstrated over different grains with data from two citizen science initiatives. The S-COM index can be used both to assess feasible study extents based on coverage, user-heterogeneity, and density and to find feasible sub-study areas from a larger, indefinite area. The results identified sub-study areas of VGI for focused analysis, allowing for a larger adoption of a similar methodology in multi-scale analyses of VGI.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarea 3adata quality 3adensity 3agrains 3ainformation 3aresearch 3aresearchers 3asampling 3asocial networks 3aspatial data1 aRobertson, Colin 1 aFeick, Rob 1 aNelson, Trisalyn 0 tISPRS international journal of geo-information.g2020 Aug. 21, v. 9, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21619x2220-99647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi90904973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02634naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002800154245012800182520163500310592002801945650001601973650001301989650001302002650001002015651001302025653001402038653001102052653001902063653001802082653001402100773009602114856008902210852000902299655001202308IND60749018620221118020830.0220124e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074901862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.landusepol.2021.1057022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWorkineh, Nigatu Amsalu10aRezoning prior urban planning period for urban space development in Injibara Town, Amhara National Regional State, Ethiopia  aWith 40,836 people, the Injibara town administration is one of the twelve zonal administrative centers of Ethiopia’s Amhara National Regional State. The town has a structural plan in place. The goal of the structural plan is to guide urban space development. It is also a tool for solving problems. However, the urban plan of Injibara did not drive and solve the real issues of a town. The urban plan of the town has had frequent rezoning. The research aims to assess significant rezoning causes and the awareness level of the residents about the causes of rezoning for urban space development. Data were collected through questionnaires from residents and semi-structured interviews with key informants, elders, adults, and youth to achieve the goals. Moreover, guiding questions were applied to concerned officials for focused group discussions. Systematic random sampling technique was employed for residents, and judgmental sampling was taken for key informants, elders, adults, youth, officials of the town. Accordingly, the result of the study indicated significant causes of the rezoning were compensation, political, corruption, and high yield, respectively. There was low level of awareness and know-how of the residents about rezoning. Rezoning urban space use plan for urban space development was rezoned with less awareness and know-how of the residents. Therefore, research can better understand the significant causes of rezoning and residents’ awareness of rezoning for urban space development. The study also recommended ways to improve future land-use rezoning implementation and further research the lessons.  aPublisher supplied data 3aland policy 3aland use 3apolitics 3ayouth 3aEthiopia 0aAwareness 0aCauses 0aImplementation 0aInjibara town 0aResidents0 tLand use policy.g2021 Oct., v. 109 p.105702-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12412x0264-83777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2021.1057023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02153naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003100151245010500182520068900287592002800976650001901004650001401023650001601037650001101053650001001064650002001074650002901094650001301123650002301136653002101159653002901180653002101209653004401230653002301274653000701297653000801304653000801312653001001320653001101330653000701341653000701348653000801355653000801363653000701371653000801378653000801386700002001394773011401414856008601528852000901614655001201623IND60739257220221120144249.0210904e20210901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073925722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1275202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLombardi, Ginevra Virginia10aRenewable energy in agriculture: Farmers willingness-to-pay for a photovoltaic electric farm tractor  aThe European Union has fixed the 2020 renewable energy targets on 20% of energy obtained by renewable energy, and it posed limitation to the biofuel production by agriculture.

One of the techniques is to harness the solar energy in solar water heater for heating purpose. To enhance the effect and maximize utilization of solar energy as well as availability of warm water over night, phase changing materials (paraffin wax) are used as a thermal energy reservoir. But the problem linked with Paraffin is that it has low thermal conductivity and so to enhance it, nanoparticles are widely used. In this paper, the behaviour of nano CuO with varying concentration of paraffin has been examined and its effect in its performance has been studied. As the variation in concentration of nano CuO particles in CuO-PCM nanocomposite increases, temperature of CuO-PCM composite, outlet temperature of water, and heat transfer decreases in solar water heater.  aPublisher supplied data 3acupric oxide 3aheat transfer 3ananocomposites 3ananoparticles 3aparaffin wax 3asolar energy 3asolar heaters 3athermal conductivity 3athermal energy 3awater temperature 0aPCMs 0aParaffin wax 0aCuO-PCMs nanocomposite 0aFESEM1 aKumar, Samarjeet1 aSingh, Purushottam Kumar1 aMishra, Santosh Kr.1 aBishwakarma, Harish1 aChoudhry, Naresh P.1 aNayak, Rajen Kumar1 aDas, Alok Kumar1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8019-01550 tThermochimica acta.g2019 Jan., v. 671 p.36-42dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11747x0040-60317nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tca.2018.11.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02629naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245010300155300001800258520155500276592002801831650001701859650002101876650001101897650001201908650000901920650001301929650001301942650001201955650001101967650001101978650001501989700002002004700001602024773013102040856007502171852000902246655001202255IND60538763820221120042907.0160815e20120222xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053876382DNAL7 a10.1021/ja211073t2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPark, Kisoo10aLarge Tunneling Effect on the Hydrogen Transfer in Bis(μ-oxo)dicopper Enzyme: A Theoretical Study  ap. 3524-3531.  aType-III copper-containing enzymes have dicopper centers in their active sites and exhibit a novel capacity for activating aliphatic C–H bonds in various substrates by taking molecular oxygen. Dicopper enzyme models developed by Tolman and co-workers reveal exceptionally large kinetic isotope effects (KIEs) for the hydrogen transfer process, indicating a significant tunneling effect. In this work, we demonstrate that variational transition state theory allows accurate prediction of the KIEs and Arrhenius parameters for such model systems. This includes multidimensional tunneling based on state-of-the-art quantum-mechanical calculations of the minimum-energy path (MEP). The computational model of bis(μ-oxo)dicopper enzyme consists of 70 atoms, resulting in a 204-dimensional potential energy surface. The calculated values of Eₐᴴ – Eₐᴰ, AH/AD, and the KIE at 233 K are −1.86 kcal/mol, 0.51, and 28.1, respectively, for the isopropyl ligand system. These values agree very well with experimental values within the limits of experimental error. For the representative tunneling path (RTP) at 233 K, the pre- and post-tunneling configurations are 3.3 kcal/mol below the adiabatic energy maximum, where the hydrogen travels 0.54 Å by tunneling. We found that tunneling is very efficient for hydrogen transfer and that the RTP is very different from the MEP. It is mainly heavy atoms that move as the reaction proceeds from the reactant complex to the pretunneling configuration, and the hydrogen atom suddenly hops at that point.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive sites 3achemical bonding 3aenergy 3aenzymes 3ahops 3ahydrogen 3aisotopes 3aligands 3amodels 3aoxygen 3aprediction1 aPak, Youngshang1 aKim, Yongho0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2012 Feb. 22, v. 134, no. 7 p.3524-3531dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fja211073t3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01808naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100006400149245007500213300001400288520077000302592002801072650002701100650000901127650001201136650001301148653002201161653002201183653001901205653002001224653002101244773012401265856008401389852000901473655001201482IND60608129620221121075216.0180904e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060812962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cocis.2016.06.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZavitsas, Andreas A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1310-830710aSome opinions of an innocent bystander regarding the Hofmeister series  ap. 72-81.  aHofmeister's “water absorbing effect” of ions is quantified.

Such hydration numbers are reported for various ions of electrolytes along with the extent of ion pair formation of each salt. Experimental measurements of various colligative properties demonstrate that the hydration numbers and extents of ion pair formation remain constant over large ranges of concentration and that solutions behave “ideally” up to the point where about 50% of the total water is strongly bound to the solute and is not available to act as solvent for additional solute.  aPublisher supplied data 3aattitudes and opinions 3aions 3asolutes 3asolvents 0aHofmeister series 0aHydration numbers 0aSalt solutions 0aIon association 0aWater properties0 tCurrent opinion in colloid & interface science.g2016 June, v. 23 p.72-81dElsevier LtdwJournal:12032x1359-02947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cocis.2016.06.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03797naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094024002200135024001900157040001800176100006700194245016500261300001600426506007600442520171800518592002802236506003702264650001502301650001702316650002002333650001602353650001702369650001102386650001202397650001302409650001102422650000902433650002302442650003002465650001202495650002802507650002302535650001002558650001802568650001902586650001002605651001002615653001602625653002202641653002602663653002402689653003002713653001002743700002302753700002002776700002202796700002402818700001802842700001902860700002402879700002202903773010202925856008703027852000903114655001203123IND60532127120221207094956.0170713e20160715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053212712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.03.1482doi7 aPMC48636522pmcid7 a270703822pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKulinkina, Alexandra V.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4777-125410aPiped water consumption in Ghana: A case study of temporal and spatial patterns of clean water demand relative to alternative water sources in rural small towns  ap. 291-301.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aContinuous access to adequate quantities of safe water is essential for human health and socioeconomic development. Piped water systems (PWSs) are an increasingly common type of water supply in rural African small towns. We assessed temporal and spatial patterns in water consumption from public standpipes of four PWSs in Ghana in order to assess clean water demand relative to other available water sources. Low water consumption was evident in all study towns, which manifested temporally and spatially. Temporal variability in water consumption that is negatively correlated with rainfall is an indicator of rainwater preference when it is available. Furthermore, our findings show that standpipes in close proximity to alternative water sources such as streams and hand-dug wells suffer further reductions in water consumption. Qualitative data suggest that consumer demand in the study towns appears to be driven more by water quantity, accessibility, and perceived aesthetic water quality, as compared to microbiological water quality or price. In settings with chronic under-utilization of improved water sources, increasing water demand through household connections, improving water quality with respect to taste and appropriateness for laundry, and educating residents about health benefits of using piped water should be prioritized. Continued consumer demand and sufficient revenue generation are important attributes of a water service that ensure its function over time. Our findings suggest that analyzing water consumption of existing metered PWSs in combination with qualitative approaches may enable more efficient planning of community-based water supplies and support sustainable development.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aaesthetics 3acase studies 3aconsumer demand 3acorrelation 3ahuman health 3aincome 3alaundry 3aplanning 3aprices 3arain 3arural water supply 3asocioeconomic development 3astreams 3asustainable development 3atemporal variation 3atowns 3awater quality 3awater quantity 3awells 3aGhana 0aRural water 0aWater consumption 0aImproved water access 0aPiped water systems 0aFunctional sustainability 0aGhana1 aKosinski, Karen C.1 aLiss, Alexander1 aAdjei, Michael N.1 aAyamgah, Gilbert A.1 aWebb, Patrick1 aGute, David M.1 aPlummer, Jeanine D.1 aNaumova, Elena N.0 tScience of the total environment.g2016 July 15, v. 559 p.291-301dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.03.1483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02702naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100003500140245011100175300002000286520115900306592002801465650002201493650002101515650004401536650001701580650003701597650001401634650001401648650001801662650000901680650001901689650001801708650000701726650001501733650001301748650002001761650003301781650001601814650002101830650003701851700002901888700002901917700003001946700002501976773012402001856007402125852000902199655001202208IND60667217520221119230032.0190919e20150129xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066721752DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra15995k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRaghavendra, Gownolla Malegowd10aAntibacterial nanocomposite hydrogels for superior biomedical applications: a Facile eco-friendly approach  ap. 14351-14358.  aIn this scientific paper, we report a facile and eco-friendly fabrication of antibacterial nanocomposite hydrogels of Au-core Ag-shell nanoparticles, embedded within Carbopol® 980 NF/Noveon® AA-1 polycarbophil acrylic acid polymeric matrix. The aim of the study was to investigate whether these nanocomposite hydrogels have the potential to be used for bacterial inactivation applications. The key feature was that, unlike the use of chemical reductants, auxiliary stabilizers and specialized expensive equipment, the Au-core Ag-shell nanoparticles (∼15 ± 3 nm) were synthesized utilizing aqueous mint leaf extracts. The developed hydrogels were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy/energy-dispersive spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analysis. Swelling studies were performed in phosphate buffered saline (pH 7.4) solution. A sustained antibacterial study against E. coli (G−) and B. subtilis (G+) showed their excellent antibacterial efficiency, which suggested that the developed hydrogels are potential candidates for a wide range of biomedical applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus subtilis 3aEscherichia coli 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aacrylic acid 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3aequipment 3ahydrogels 3aleaf extracts 3amint 3ananocomposites 3ananoparticles 3apH 3aphosphates 3apolymers 3areducing agents 3ascanning electron microscopy 3astabilizers 3athermogravimetry 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aJayaramudu, Tippabattini1 aVaraprasad, Kokkarachedu1 aMohan Reddy, Goddeti Siva1 aRaju, Konduru Mohana0 tRSC advances.g2015 Jan. 29, v. 5, no. 19 p.14351-14358dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ra15995k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04086naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245008200171300001600253520280400269592002803073650001903101650001703120650001803137650002203155650002403177650001603201650000903217650001103226650001603237650001303253650001103266650001603277650000903293650001303302651001003315700002103325700002303346700002503369700002103394773010003415856008103515990002303596852000903619655001203628IND60099316420221119192640.0141105e20130315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009931642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gca.2012.11.0392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDi Napoli, Rossella10aQuantitative models of hydrothermal fluid–mineral reaction: The Ischia case  ap. 108-129.  aThe intricate pathways of fluid–mineral reactions occurring underneath active hydrothermal systems are explored in this study by applying reaction path modelling to the Ischia case study. Ischia Island, in Southern Italy, hosts a well-developed and structurally complex hydrothermal system which, because of its heterogeneity in chemical and physical properties, is an ideal test sites for evaluating potentialities/limitations of quantitative geochemical models of hydrothermal reactions. We used the EQ3/6 software package, version 7.2b, to model reaction of infiltrating waters (mixtures of meteoric water and seawater in variable proportions) with Ischia’s reservoir rocks (the Mount Epomeo Green Tuff units; MEGT). The mineral assemblage and composition of such MEGT units were initially characterised by ad hoc designed optical microscopy and electron microprobe analysis, showing that phenocrysts (dominantly alkali–feldspars and plagioclase) are set in a pervasively altered (with abundant clay minerals and zeolites) groundmass. Reaction of infiltrating waters with MEGT minerals was simulated over a range of realistic (for Ischia) temperatures (95–260°C) and CO₂ fugacities (10⁻⁰.² to 10⁰.⁵) bar. During the model runs, a set of secondary minerals (selected based on independent information from alteration minerals’ studies) was allowed to precipitate from model solutions, when saturation was achieved. The compositional evolution of model solutions obtained in the 95–260°C runs were finally compared with compositions of Ischia’s thermal groundwaters, demonstrating an overall agreement. Our simulations, in particular, well reproduce the Mg-depleting maturation path of hydrothermal solutions, and have end-of-run model solutions whose Na–K–Mg compositions well reflect attainment of full-equilibrium conditions at run temperature. High-temperature (180–260°C) model runs are those best matching the Na–K–Mg compositions of Ischia’s most chemically mature water samples, supporting quenching of deep-reservoir conditions for these surface manifestations; whilst Fe, SiO₂ and, to a lesser extent, SO₄ contents of natural samples are better reproduced in low-temperature (95°C) runs, suggesting that these species reflect conditions of water–rock interaction in the shallow hydrothermal environment. The ability of model runs to reproduce the compositional features of Ischia’s thermal manifestations, demonstrated here, adds supplementary confidence on reaction path modelling as a realistic and insightful representation of mineral–fluid hydrothermal reactions. Our results, in particular, demonstrate the significant impact of host rock minerals’ assemblage in governing the paths and trends of hydrothermal fluids’ maturation.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3acase studies 3aclay minerals 3acomputer software 3aelectron microscopy 3agroundwater 3airon 3amodels 3aplagioclase 3aseawater 3asilica 3atemperature 3atuff 3azeolites 3aItaly1 aFederico, Cinzia1 aAiuppa, Alessandro1 aD’Antonio, Massimo1 aValenza, Mariano0 tGeochimica et cosmochimica acta.g2013 Mar. 15, v. 105 p.108-129dElsevier Ltdx0016-70377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gca.2012.11.0393Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle04403naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005900139245011900198300001600317500001900333500002000352520219600372592002802568596002202596596002302618596003802641596007102679596008302750596005102833596005202884650001602936650002602952650002202978650001403000650001403014650001503028650001703043650001703060650001803077650001603095650000903111650001703120650001103137650001303148650003203161650001403193650001703207650001503224650001403239700005603253700002303309700006303332700006203395700005503457700006003512773012303572856007303695852000903768655001203777IND60733664820221117183543.0210410e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073366482DNAL7 a10.1111/evj.133142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPezzanite, Lynn1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4990-500610aUse of in vitro assays to identify antibiotics that are cytotoxic to normal equine chondrocytes and synovial cells  ap. 579-589.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: Intra‐articular (IA) antibiotic usage is prevalent in equine practice. However, recent emergence of antimicrobial resistance prompts re‐evaluation of antibiotic selection, particularly when used prophylactically. Furthermore, many commonly used antibiotics exert direct cytotoxicity to equine cells, and appropriate IA doses have not been defined. OBJECTIVES: To screen antibiotics in vitro as an initial assessment of cytotoxicity against normal equine joint cells in monolayer culture and explant tissues. STUDY DESIGN: In vitro experimental study. METHODS: Chondrocytes and synovial cells were harvested from three horses and plated on 24‐well plates (100 000 cells/wells in triplicate) for 48 hours prior to addition of antibiotics. Joint cells were exposed to antibiotics (n = 15) at various doses (25‐0.39 mg/mL in complete DMEM media) for 24 hours and viability was assessed by trypan blue dye exclusion. The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) was determined for each antibiotic. Cartilage explants were obtained from 3 horses, minced and exposed to antibiotics (n = 5) for 72 hours. Live/dead staining was performed, and fluorescence was visualised using Olympus IX83 spinning disk confocal microscope. Percentage of live vs dead cells was quantified. RESULTS: Antibiotics from different antimicrobial classes expressed dose‐dependent but variable cytotoxicity to equine joint cells in vitro. Aminoglycosides and doxycycline had the lowest IC50 (most toxic). Ampicillin sulbactam, imipenem, tobramycin, ceftiofur sodium and amoxicillin had IC50 > 25 mg/mL for at least one cell line, representing potentially less cytotoxic alternatives. MAIN LIMITATIONS: Further studies are necessary to extrapolate these in vitro data results to the in vivo joint environment. CONCLUSIONS: Targeted IA antibiotic therapy would involve selection of the safest antibiotics (highest IC50) with efficacy based on bacterial culture/sensitivity. Antimicrobial selection and evidence‐based dosing may minimise damage to native articular cartilage and synovial cells and development of antimicrobial resistance when IA antibiotics are used in equine practice.  aPublisher supplied data  cVerdad Foundation  cShipley Foundation  aTL1TR002533cCCTSI NIH/NCATS CTSA  cColorado State University CVMBS Veterinary Summer Scholars Program  cColorado State University Young Investigator Award in Companion Animal Studies  aNI18AHDR1019785G010cAnimal Health and Disease  cUSDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture 3aamoxicillin 3aantibiotic resistance 3abacterial culture 3acartilage 3aceftiofur 3acell lines 3achondrocytes 3acytotoxicity 3adose response 3adoxycycline 3adyes 3afluorescence 3ahorses 3aimipenem 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3asulbactam 3atherapeutics 3atobramycin 3aviability1 aChow, Lyndah1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6413-95171 aPiquini, Gabriella1 aGriffenhagen, Gregg1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3522-55871 aRamirez, Dominique1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2944-82501 aDow, Steven1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5488-94641 aGoodrich, Laurie1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8010-44290 tEquine veterinary journal.g2021 May, v. 53, no. 3 p.579-589dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl1170x0425-16447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/evj.133143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02621naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245009200170300001600262500001900278520143800297592002801735650001201763650002701775650001401802650003401816650002201850651001101872651000901883651001801892653001501910653001501925653001101940653002901951653001401980700001901994773011602013856008502129852000902214655001202223IND60696823820221119082106.0200601e20200527xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069682382DNAL7 a10.1080/17565529.2019.16373302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFuller, R.

Evidence from Oxfam’s impact evaluations  ap. 420-435.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aGiven the complexity of measuring resilience, development practitioners are constantly seeking observable proxies that can help target resilience-building initiatives. Evidence suggests that female-headed and male-headed households differ in terms of their vulnerability and resilience, so household head gender may provide policymakers with important information about how best to target their interventions. However, the extent to which these gender differences can be explained by other observable characteristics, such as education and household demographics, remains an open question. Using an index of resilience employed by a large non-governmental organization (Oxfam GB), we provide evidence on this question by comparing the resilience of female- and male-headed households interviewed in a series of 16 evaluations of rural development projects carried out in 12 countries across Africa, Asia, and Latin America. We find that there is a statistically significant difference between female- and male-headed households, on average, in terms of their measured resilience, and that only just over half of this difference can be explained by observable characteristics. However, since the size of this difference is small, using information on household head gender does not significantly improve the accuracy of targeting methods, such as proxy means tests, that aim to identify households for resilience-building initiatives.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3ademographic statistics 3aeducation 3anongovernmental organizations 3arural development 3aAfrica 3aAsia 3aLatin America 0aResilience 0aadaptation 0agender 0afemale-headed households 0atargeting1 aLain, Jonathan0 tClimate and development.g2020 May 27, v. 12, no. 5 p.420-435dTaylor & FranciswJournal:19683x1756-55377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17565529.2019.16373303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02343naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006500150245010600215300001600321520116200337592002801499650001501527650001301542650001701555650001501572650001901587653003001606653002101636653002901657653001701686653003801703700005601741773010301797856008401900852000901984655001201993IND60600456720221121221603.0180703e20140601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060045672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2014.03.1152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGholamalizadeh, Ehsan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1524-452910aThermo-economic triple-objective optimization of a solar chimney power plant using genetic algorithms  ap. 204-211.  aA triple-objective design method was developed for a solar chimney power plant system that simultaneously optimizes the expenditure, total efficiency, and power output. A multi-objective genetic algorithm was used to obtain the best combination of geometric parameters of the power plant. The following design parameters were selected: collector radius, chimney height, and chimney diameter. Two different solar chimney power plant configurations were considered: the Kerman pilot power plant and Manzanares prototype power plant. A set of possible optimal solutions (Pareto optimal set) was obtained. Based on the optimal solutions, the best configuration for each power plant was selected. The performance and expenditure of the optimal solutions and the built power plants were compared. The results showed that the increment of the power output was higher than the increment of the expenditure in the optimal configuration. A parametric study was conducted to evaluate the effects of changing design parameters on different objective functions. This paper provides a very useful design and optimization methodology for solar chimney power plant systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3ageometry 3apower plants 3aprototypes 3asolar chimneys 0aSolar chimney power plant 0aRenewable energy 0aThermo-economic analysis 0aOptimization 0aMulti-objective genetic algorithm1 aKim, Man-Hoe1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5799-55610 tEnergy.g2014 June 01, v. 70 p.204-211dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2014.03.1153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02967naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245009900167300001600266520148700282592002801769650001701797650001101814650001101825650002001836650001601856650001101872650002101883650002101904650001401925650001801939650003701957650001101994650001902005650001502024650002202039650001502061653003002076653002302106653002002129653002002149700001502169700001202184700001802196700001802214700001702232773010502249856008602354852000902440655001202449IND60531196220221118085322.0190318e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053119622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2016.04.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Gao-Lin10aMosaic-pattern vegetation formation and dynamics driven by the water–wind crisscross erosion  ap. 355-362.  aTheoretical explanations for vegetation pattern dynamic emphasized on banded pattern-forming systems on the dynamics of the spot pattern. In this context, we explore the patch pattern forming and development in the desertification land. We hypothesized that spatial heterogeneity of microtopography and soil properties with different patch sizes would determine vegetation pattern dynamics theory. The spatial heterogeneity of microtopography and soil properties with different patch sizes were studied. Differences between the inside and outside of the canopy of soil carbon content and soil total nitrogen content were significantly increasing with patches sizes. Sampling location across vegetation patch was the main factor controlling soil properties. Soil nutrient content and saturated hydraulic conductivity were the largest, while bulk density and the coarse sand content were the lowest at the sampling location of half-way between taproot and downslope edge of the canopy. The height of the mound relative to the adjacent soil interspace between shrubs increased as patches diameter increased at the upslope of the taproot. Hydrological and aeolian processes resulted in spatial distributions of soil moisture, nutrition properties, which lead to patch migrated to downslope rather than upslope. A conceptual model was integrated hydrological and nutrient facilitation and competition effects among the plant-soil in mosaic-pattern patch formation and succession process.  aPublisher supplied data 3abulk density 3acanopy 3acarbon 3adesertification 3amicrorelief 3amodels 3anitrogen content 3anutrient content 3anutrition 3asand fraction 3asaturated hydraulic conductivity 3ashrubs 3asoil nutrients 3asoil water 3aspatial variation 3avegetation 0aVegetation patch dynamics 0aNutrient processes 0aAeolian process 0aMicrotopography1 aWang, Dong1 aLiu, Yu1 aHao, Hong-Min1 aFang, Nu-Fang1 aShi, Zhi-Hua0 tJournal of hydrology.g2016 July, v. 538 p.355-362dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2016.04.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02954naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002200145245011300167300001600280520178800296592002802084650001902112650001902131650002502150650001202175650001902187650001602206650002602222650002102248650002402269650002402293651001002317700001502327700002002342700001902362773009702381856008102478852000902559655001202568IND4445293220221118101058.0141110e20110114xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444529322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fcr.2010.09.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPathak, Himanshu,10aPotential and cost of carbon sequestration in Indian agriculture: Estimates from long-term field experiments  ap. 102-111.  aCarbon sequestration in tropical soils has potential for mitigating global warming and increasing agricultural productivity. We analyzed 26 long-term experiments (LTEs) in different agro-climatic zones (ACZs) of India to assess the potential and cost of C sequestration. Data on initial and final soil organic C (SOC) concentration in the recommended N, P and K (NPK); recommended N, P and K plus farmyard manure (NPK+FYM) and unfertilized (control) treatments were used to calculate carbon sequestration potential (CSP) i.e., capacity to sequester atmospheric carbon dioxide (COâ) by increasing SOC stock, under different nutrient management scenarios. In most of the LTEs wheat equivalent yields were higher in the NPK+FYM treatment than the NPK treatment. However, partial factor productivity (PFP) was more with the NPK treatment. Average SOC concentration of the control treatment was 0.54%, which increased to 0.65% in the NPK treatment and 0.82% in the NPK+FYM treatment. Compared to the control treatment the NPK+FYM treatment sequestered 0.33MgChaâ»Â¹yrâ»Â¹ whereas the NPK treatment sequestered 0.16MgChaâ»Â¹yrâ»Â¹. The CSP in different nutrient management scenarios ranged from 2.1 to 4.8MgChaâ»Â¹ during the study period (average 16.9 yr) of the LTEs. In 17 out of 26 LTEs, the NPK+FYM treatment had higher SOC and also higher net return than that of the NPK treatment. In the remaining 9 LTEs SOC sequestration in the NPK+FYM treatment was accomplished with decreased net return suggesting that these are economically not attractive and farmers have to incur into additional cost to achieve C sequestration. The feasibility of SOC sequestration in terms of availability of FYM and other organic sources has been discussed in the paper.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal manures 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon sequestration 3afarmers 3aglobal warming 3agrain yield 3along term experiments 3anitrogen content 3anutrient management 3asoil organic carbon 3aIndia1 aByjesh, K.1 aChakrabarti, B.1 aAggarwal, P.K.0 tField crops research.g2011 Jan. 14, v. 120, no. 1 p.102-111dElsevier B.V.x0378-42907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fcr.2010.09.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01894naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245004600166300001600212520090800228592002801136650001201164650002501176650001701201650002401218700002001242700001701262700001901279700001801298700001601316700002001332773011401352856008101466852000901547655001201556IND60439986220221119092628.0151024e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043998622DNAL7 a10.1134/S10214437150401352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMamaeva, A.

Nevertheless, some extremely important aspects of NO biology are still far from being clarified. There exist different points of view on NO formation and utilization in plants. The mechanisms of perception and transduction of the NO signal are not yet fully understood, and the origin of specificity underlying coordinated activation of responses to NO remains unresolved. It is reasonable to expect that the deep knowledge of NO functioning in animals may provide some keys to these questions. Such a comparative analysis is a way to reveal similarities and emphasize the differences in the current understanding of the NO role in plants. The present lecture highlights these aspects of NO functioning.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimals 3adevelopmental stages 3anitric oxide 3asignal transduction1 aFomenkov, A.

Then, the spatial–temporal distribution and evolution characteristics of deformation were investigated in detail. The deformation mechanism is explained by factors including groundwater and rainfall. By introducing the seasonal changes of tides and sediment accumulation, the reason for the uplift in the Shanghai area is further explained. Finally, the surface deformation of the reclamation area is detected further. Meanwhile, the spatial–temporal variation characteristics of the surface in the reclamation area are explored. Through time series InSAR technology, the results of surface deformation in Shanghai demonstrate the following: (1) The deformation in the study area is uneven in time, and the subsidence is especially apparent during the 2016–2017 period. The maximum cumulative subsidence amounts to −131.1 mm, and the PS points with subsidence rates greater than −5 mm/y occupy 41.36% of all the subsidence points. In addition, PS points with uplift rates greater than 5 mm/y account for 39.55% of all the uplift points. The overall spatial distribution in the Shanghai area is characterized by the uplift in the north and subsidence in the south, whereas the cumulative subsidence in the time series presents a slowing trend; (2) Surface subsidence and groundwater, rainfall, and urban development in the Shanghai area are correlated. Seasonal changes in tides contribute to surface uplift in coastal areas. Coastal sediment accumulation and soil changes also make direct contributions to the occurrence of surface uplift; (3) The deformation of the reclamation area and the completion time are correlated, and the subsidence points of the reclamation area are mainly concentrated on the surrounding dikes from 2016 to 2020. The cumulative subsidence of the two years from 2016 to 2017 is up to −102.2 mm. The results of this study systematically explore the spatial–-temporal evolution and causes of surface deformation in Shanghai, providing scientific data which can support the development of Shanghai.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoastal sediments 3adeformation 3aevolution 3agroundwater 3ahumans 3arain 3asoil 3asubsidence 3atime series analysis 3aurban development 3aChina1 aZhou, Lv 1 aZhu, Zilin 1 aQin, Jie 1 aXian, Lingxiao 1 aZhang, Di 1 aHuang, Ling 0 tRemote Sensing.g2022 Sept. 02, v. 14, no. 17dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs141743683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03679naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001700094024002100111024003600132024001100168040001800179100002000197245008600217300001600303500001500319506017300334520163600507592002802143650002102171650001402192650002402206650002802230650001202258650002902270650001802299650002002317650002302337650001302360650002302373650001602396650002402412653001602436653001602452653002102468653001702489700002102506700002302527700002002550773015102570856008302721856011202804956019102916961000903107852000903116655001203125IND60130037520221214225017.0190412e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013003752DNAL7 a3037822aris7 a10113/608512hdl7 a10.1016/j.rama.2015.01.0112doi8 ans7216  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNafus, Aleta M.10aAbundances of Coplanted Native Bunchgrasses and Crested Wheatgrass after 13 Years  ap. 211-214.  a2019-12-06  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aCrested wheatgrass (Agropyron cristatum [L] Gaertm) has been seeded on more than 5 million hectares in western North America because it establishes more readily than native bunchgrasses. Currently, there is substantial interest in reestablishing native species in sagebrush steppe, but efforts to reintroduce native grasses into crested wheatgrass stands have been largely unsuccessful, and little is known about the long-term dynamics of crested wheatgrass/native species mixes. We examined the abundance of crested wheatgrass and seven native sagebrush steppe bunchgrasses planted concurrently at equal low densities in nongrazed and unburned plots. Thirteen years post establishment, crested wheatgrass was the dominant bunchgrass, with a 10-fold increase in density. Idaho fescue (Festuca idahoensis Elmer), Thurber’s needlegrass (Achnatherum thurberianum (Piper) Barkworth), basin wildrye (Leymus cinereus [Scribn. & Merr.] A. Löve), and Sandberg bluegrass (Poa secunda J. Presl) maintained their low planting density, whereas bluebunch wheatgrass (Pseudoroegneria spicata [Pursh] A. Löve), needle-and-thread (Hesperostipa comata [Trin. & Rupr.] Barkworth), and squirreltail (Elymus elymoides [Raf.] Swezey) densities declined. Our results suggest that densities of native bunchgrasses planted with crested wheatgrass are unlikely to increase and that some species may only persist at low levels. The high recruitment of crested wheatgrass suggests that coplanting of some native bunchgrasses may be a viable way of avoiding crested wheatgrass monocultures when this species is necessary for rehabilitation or restoration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aElymus elymoides 3aArtemisia 3aHesperostipa comata 3aPseudoroegneria spicata 3asteppes 3aAchnatherum thurberianum 3aplant density 3aLeymus cinereus 3aindigenous species 3aplanting 3aFestuca idahoensis 3aPoa secunda 3aAgropyron cristatum 0arestoration 0arecruitment 0asagebrush steppe 0arevegetation1 aSvejcar, Tony J.1 aGanskopp, David C.1 aDavies, Kirk W.0 tRangeland ecology & management.g2015 Mar., v. 68, no. 2 p.211-214dElsevier Inc.aSociety for Range ManagementwJournal:jnl44569x1550-74247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rama.2015.01.0113Available from publisher's site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/608513Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  aARIS submissionbhttp://submit-u.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/303782%20Abundance%20of%20coplanted%20native%20bunchgrasses%20and%20crested%20wheatgrass%20after%2013%20years_0.pdf  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle02707naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245010900171300001400280520134700294592002801641650001101669650002201680650001801702650001201720650002001732650002601752650001801778650000901796650001701805650002801822650000901850650003001859650003001889650002601919650001601945650001201961700001801973700001901991700002202010700001802032773010902050856008102159852000902240655001202249IND60517747120221120091106.0160519e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051774712DNAL7 a10.1007/s00441-015-2294-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRaslan, Abdulrahman10aPannexin-1 expression in developing mouse nervous system: new evidence for expression in sensory ganglia  ap. 29-41.  aPannexin1 (Panx1) is one of three members of the pannexin protein family. The expression of Panx1 mRNA has been extensively investigated from late embryonic to adult stages. In contrast, expression during early embryonic development is largely unknown. Our aim is to examine the temporal and spatial expression of Panx1 in mouse embryonic development by focusing on embryonic days (E) 9.5 to 12.5. Whole embryos are investigated in order to provide a comprehensive survey. Analyses were performed at the mRNA level by using reverse transcription plus the polymerase chain reaction and whole-mount in situ hybridization. Panx1 mRNA was detected in the heads and bodies of embryos at all developmental stages investigated (E9.5, E10.5, E11.5, E12.5). In particular, the nervous system expressed Panx1 at an early time point. Interestingly, Panx1 expression was found in afferent ganglia of the cranial nerves and spinal cord. This finding is of particular interest in the context of neuropathic pain and other Panx1-related neurological disorders. Our study shows, for the first time, that Panx1 is expressed in the central and peripheral nervous system during early developmental stages. The consequences of Panx1 deficiency or inhibition in a number of experimental paradigms might therefore be predicated on changes during early development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aearly development 3aembryogenesis 3aganglia 3agene expression 3ain situ hybridization 3amessenger RNA 3amice 3anerve tissue 3anervous system diseases 3apain 3aperipheral nervous system 3apolymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcription 3aspinal cord 3asurveys1 aHainz, Nadine1 aBeckmann, Anja1 aTschernig, Thomas1 aMeier, Carola0 tCell and tissue research.g2016 Apr., v. 364, no. 1 p.29-41dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0302-766X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00441-015-2294-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03106naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002700166245011600193300001800309520132100327592002801648650002401676650001701700650002101717650001101738650002601749650001001775650001701785650001101802650002601813650002201839650001501861650003301876650002701909650001801936650001301954650001501967650002701982650003802009650002702047650001102074650004202085650002902127650004102156651001302197651001302210700002702223700002502250700002002275700002602295700002002321773011802341856004802459852000902507655001202516IND50058893520221119174323.0121011e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5005889352DNAL7 a221936302pmid7 a10.1007/s10661-011-2454-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAl-Odaini, Najat Ahmed10aApplication of chemometrics in understanding the spatial distribution of human pharmaceuticals in surface water  ap. 6735-6748.  aThe growing interest in the environmental occurrence of veterinary and human pharmaceuticals is essentially due to their possible health implications to humans and ecosystem. This study assesses the occurrence of human pharmaceuticals in a Malaysian tropical aquatic environment taking a chemometric approach using cluster analysis, discriminant analysis and principal component analysis. Water samples were collected from seven sampling stations along the heavily populated Langat River basin on the west coast of peninsular Malaysia and its main tributaries. Water samples were extracted using solid-phase extraction and analyzed using liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) for 18 pharmaceuticals and one metabolite, which cover a range of six therapeutic classes widely consumed in Malaysia. Cluster analysis was applied to group both pharmaceutical pollutants and sampling stations. Cluster analysis successfully clustered sampling stations and pollutants into three major clusters. Discriminant analysis was applied to identify those pollutants which had a significant impact in the definition of clusters. Finally, principal component analysis using a three-component model determined the constitution and data variance explained by each of the three main principal components.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquatic environment 3achemometrics 3acluster analysis 3acoasts 3adiscriminant analysis 3adrugs 3ahuman health 3ahumans 3aliquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3apollutants 3aprincipal component analysis 3asolid phase extraction 3asurface water 3avariance 3awatersheds 2aChromatography, Liquid 2aEnvironmental Monitoringxmethods 2aFresh Waterxchemistry 2aHumans 2aPharmaceutical Preparationsxanalysis 2aTandem Mass Spectrometry 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysis 3aMalaysia 0aMalaysia1 aZakaria, Mohamad Pauzi1 aZali, Muniirah Abdul1 aJuahir, Hafizan1 aYaziz, Mohamad Ismail1 aSalmijah Surif,0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2012 Nov., v. 184, no. 11 p.6735-6748dSpringer-Verlagx0167-63697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-011-2454-3  aDNAL 7aarticle03144naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001200155245014900167520142100316592002801737650001501765650001601780650001901796650002101815650001801836650002001854650002801874650001801902650002201920650001001942650002601952650002201978650001502000650001102015650003402026650002502060650001902085650001902104650001502123650002102138650001402159653003002173653000902203653002602212653002002238700001502258700001502273700001402288700001302302700001702315700001502332700001702347773009102364856009002455852000902545655001202554IND60699656920221121043700.0200907e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069965692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.1274652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Ren10aNitrogen-deficient g-C3Nx/POMs porous nanosheets with P–N heterojunctions capable of the efficient photocatalytic degradation of ciprofloxacin  aThe direct shedding of piperazine rings is critical for the degradation of antibiotic persistent organic pollutants. In this work, nitrogen-deficient g-C₃N₄ loaded with polyoxometalates porous photocatalysts with P–N heterojunctions were carried out through the formation of chemical bonds between the nitrogen-deficient C⁺ in g-C₃Nₓ and the bridging oxygen in polyoxometalates (POMs), including phosphomolybdic acid (PMA), phosphotungstic acid (PTA) and silicotungstic acid (STA). The adsorption and photocatalysis experiments confirm the ability of the g-C₃Nₓ/POMs nanosheets to efficiently remove ciprofloxacin via the synergistic effects of adsorption and photo-catalysis. Approximately, g-C₃Nₓ/POMs-30 exhibits the optimal degradation ability, and the degradation rates of g-C₃Nₓ/PMA-30, g-C₃Nₓ/PTA-30 and g-C₃Nₓ/STA-30 could respectively reach 93.1%, 97.4% and 95.6% within only 5 min under visible light. The free radical scavenging experiment and ESR free radical capture experiments confirm that ·OH and ·O₂⁻ are free radicals that effectively degrade CIP. According to the results of the LC-MS analysis, the intermediates produced after CIP degradation and the efficient degradation pathway are proposed. The direct shedding of piperazine rings in the decarboxylation and defluorination process leads to the most efficient degradation of CIP into the small molecules.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aantibiotics 3acarbon nitride 3achemical bonding 3aciprofloxacin 3adecarboxylation 3afree radical scavengers 3afree radicals 3ahydroxyl radicals 3alight 3aliquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3ananosheets 3aoxygen 3apersistent organic pollutants 3aphosphotungstic acid 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3apiperazine 3asuperoxide anion 3asynergism 0aNitrogen-deficient g-C3Nx 0aPOMs 0aP–N heterojunctions 0aPhoto-catalysis1 aXue, Kehui1 aWang, Jing1 aYan, Ying1 aPeng, Yi1 aYang, Tianli1 aHu, Yunchu1 aWang, Wenlei0 tChemosphere.g2020 Nov., v. 259 p.127465-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.1274653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02917naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245003700170300001800207520135800225592002801583650002501611650002201636650001901658650001401677650001401691650001601705650001601721650002101737650002501758650001801783650001601801650001401817650002501831650001601856653001601872653001501888653002001903653002101923653002401944700001801968700002601986700002102012700002102033700002902054700001902083700002102102700002002123773013802143856008502281852000902366655001202375IND60573632920221119140225.0170724e20170803xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057363292DNAL7 a10.1080/10942912.2016.12203932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbbas, Munawar10aNatural polyphenols: An overview  ap. 1689-1699.  aPlant-derived functional foods are gaining considerable attention due to their safety and therapeutic potentials. Research on plant-based functional foods presents several challenges ranges from hypercholesterolemia to cancer prevention. In last decade, special attention has been paid to edible plants and especially their phytochemicals. Today, there is an increasing interest in their bioactivities provided by these phytochemicals. Polyphenols are the most numerous and widely distributed group of bioactive molecules. Polyphenols have two general classes, one is flavonoids and other is phenolic acids. Among these, flavonoids are further divided into flavones, flavononse, flavonols, flavanols, isoflavones, and phenolic acids are generally classified into hydroxybenzoic and hydroxycinnamic acids. Fruit peel is one of the dense sources for flavonoids and their content may vary from species to species and due to exposure of light. Polyphenols have wide range of molecules and different set of biological activities that are mainly attributed to their structure. Investigations have revealed that polyphenols play a key role to prevent various diseases, like hypercholesterolemia, hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, and cancer insurgence. The current review article summarizes the literature pertaining to polyphenols and its allied health benefits.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioactive properties 3achemical elements 3acoumaric acids 3aflavanols 3aflavonols 3afood plants 3afruit peels 3afunctional foods 3ahypercholesterolemia 3ahyperglycemia 3aisoflavones 3aneoplasms 3aphytopharmaceuticals 3apolyphenols 0aPolyphenols 0aFlavonoids 0aHealth benefits 0aFunctional foods 0aBioactive molecules1 aSaeed, Farhan1 aAnjum, Faqir Muhammad1 aAfzaal, Muhammad1 aTufail, Tabussam1 aBashir, Muhammad Shakeel1 aIshtiaq, Adnan1 aHussain, Shahzad1 aSuleria, Hafiz,0 tInternational journal of food properties.g2017 Aug. 3, v. 20, no. 8 p.1689-1699dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl56717x1094-29127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10942912.2016.12203933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02553naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245010200174300001600276520102700292592002801319650001901347650001801366650001801384650001201402650001401414650000901428650001901437650000901456650001701465650000701482650001801489650002501507650001301532650001401545653002401559653000901583653001401592653001901606653002501625700001901650700002001669700002201689700002001711700005701731700002001788700002001808773009901828856008701927852000902014655001202023IND60586218920221122191612.0190402e20180515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058621892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2017.11.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMotoyama, Michiyo10aIn situ characterization of acidic and thermal protein denaturation by infrared microspectroscopy  ap. 322-329.  aFoods meet acid pH during gastric digestion after cooking.

Infrared spectra were obtained from meat samples treated with heat and/or acid, and wavenumbers accounting independently for the treatments were extracted by principal component regression. Extreme-acid treatment (pHinitial 2.0) was well predicted (0.5% error) by a simple ratio of as-observed spectral intensities at 1211 and 1396 cm−1, reflecting a perturbation in the vibration of amino acid residues (phenylalanine, tyrosine and aspartic acid) by protein unfolding and protonation. Using the imaging mode of an IR microscope, meat protein acidification was evidenced with high spatial resolution. The heat effect was well discriminated from the acid effect by the ratio of as-observed intensities at 1666 and 1697 cm−1 (0.9% error), indicating content of aggregated β-sheets relative to α-helix structure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacid treatment 3aacidification 3aaspartic acid 3acooking 3adigestion 3aheat 3aimage analysis 3ameat 3ameat protein 3apH 3aphenylalanine 3aprotein denaturation 3atyrosine 3avibration 0aInfrared microscopy 0aMeat 0aAcidic pH 0aHeat treatment 0aProtein denaturation1 aVénien, Annie1 aLoison, Olivier1 aSandt, Christophe1 aWatanabe, Genya1 aSicard, Jason1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7197-82121 aSasaki, Keisuke1 aAstruc, Thierry0 tFood chemistry.g2018 May 15, v. 248 p.322-329dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2017.11.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02564naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024002200117024001900139040001800158100001800176245010600194300001500300520110100315592002801416650002201444650002101466650001901487650001901506650001601525650001401541650001801555650001901573650001101592650000901603650001801612650002201630700001601652700001401668700001701682700001401699700002201713773015201735856007001887856010501957990002302062852000902085655001202094IND60608520120221120121757.0190510e20170124xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060852012DNAL7 a10.3791/552822doi7 aPMC53522882pmcid7 a281900622pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNatsume, Yuno10aPreparation of giant vesicles encapsulating microspheres by centrifugation of a water-in-oil emulsion  ap. e55282.  aThe constructive biology and the synthetic biology approach to creating artificial life involve the bottom-up assembly of biological or nonbiological materials. Such approaches have received considerable attention in research on the boundary between living and nonliving matter and have been used to construct artificial cells over the past two decades. In particular, Giant Vesicles (GVs) have often been used as artificial cell membranes. In this paper, we describe the preparation of GVs encapsulating highly packed microspheres as a model of cells containing highly condensed biomolecules. The GVs were prepared by means of a simple water-in-oil emulsion centrifugation method. Specifically, a homogenizer was used to emulsify an aqueous solution containing the materials to be encapsulated and an oil containing dissolved phospholipids, and the resulting emulsion was layered carefully on the surface of another aqueous solution. The layered system was then centrifuged to generate the GVs. This powerful method was used to encapsulate materials ranging from small molecules to microspheres.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaqueous solutions 3aartificial cells 3acell membranes 3acentrifugation 3aemulsifying 3aemulsions 3aencapsulation 3amicroparticles 3amodels 3aoils 3aphospholipids 3asynthetic biology1 aWen, Hsin-i1 aZhu, Tong1 aItoh, Kazumi1 aSheng, Li1 aKurihara, Kensuke0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2017 Jan. 24, , no. 119 p.e55282-e55282dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3791/552823Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/55282/preparation-giant-vesicles-encapsulating-microspheres-centrifugation  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03089naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002400094040001800118100002600136245014600162300001400308520165400322592002801976650001902004650002902023650001702052650001802069650001002087650001402097650002002111650001202131651001302143651001202156651001402168651001602182651001302198651001402211651001302225653003102238653001902269653001202288653001802300653002902318653002802347653002502375773012402400856007402524852000902598655001202607IND60126104320221118165448.0151105e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012610432DNAL7 a10.1654/4672.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRichardson, Dennis J.10aAcanthocephala of the Raccoon (Procyon lotor) with a Faunal Review of Macracanthorhynchus ingens (Archiacanthocephala: Oligacanthorhynchidae)  ap. 44-52.  aNine species of acanthocephalans have previously been reported from the raccoon, Procyon lotor, from North America: Centrorhynchus conspectus, Centrorhynchus sp., Echinorhynchus gadi, Moniliformis sp., Neoechinorhynchus cylindratus, Oligacanthorhynchus tortuosa, Plagiorhynchus cylindraceus, Profilicollis botulus, and Macracanthorhynchus ingens. Herein is reported for the first time the collection of Arythmorhynchus frassoni, Centrorhynchus spinonsus, and Southwellina hispida, each from single raccoons on Ossabaw Island, Georgia. The specimen previously identified as O. tortuosa was redetermined as M. ingens. Thus, this brings the total number of acanthocephalan species reported from the raccoon to 11. Infections of raccoons with all but M. ingens were of immature worms acquired by ingestion of intermediate or paratenic hosts or worms apparently ingested with infected definitive hosts. The many extensive surveys conducted of raccoons suggest that M. ingens is the only acanthocephalan that utilizes Procyon lotor as definitive host. A faunal review of M. ingens is provided, revealing that this acanthocephalan exhibits a broad distribution across much of the eastern United States. Macracanthorhynchus ingens is reported for the first time from Mississippi, Nebraska, and Oklahoma. Also, M. ingens is reported for the first time from a raccoon (P. lotor) in Nicaragua and a kinkajou (Potos flavus) in Colombia. Additionally, cystacanths are reported from a bess beetle, Odontotaenius disjunctus, from Louisiana, representing a new intermediate host record and the first report of the natural occurrence of M. ingens from a coleopteran.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcanthocephala 3aOdontotaenius disjunctus 3aPotos flavus 3aProcyon lotor 3afauna 3aingestion 3aparatenic hosts 3asurveys 3aColombia 3aGeorgia 3aLouisiana 3aMississippi 3aNebraska 3aNicaragua 3aOklahoma 0aMacracanthorhynchus ingens 0aAcanthocephala 0aRaccoon 0aProcyon lotor 0aArythmorhynchus frassoni 0aCentrorhynchus spinosus 0aSouthwellina hispida0 tComparative parasitology.g2014 Jan., v. 81, no. 1 p.44-52dThe Helminthological Society of Washingtonx1525-26477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1654/4672.13Available from publisher's Web site  aDNAL 7aarticle03353naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001800156245012400174520135800298592002801656650003101684650002101715650002801736650001701764650001401781650001501795650001201810650000901822650001101831650001901842650001301861650001701874650001201891650002501903650001601928650001701944653003901961653001602000653001302016653003402029653005602063653002302119653003502142700006702177700006102244700001702305700002002322700001302342700001702355700001702372700001602389700002202405700006202427700005702489773009302546856009102639852000902730655001202739IND60763002820221117225213.0220502e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076300282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2022.1213702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKatyal, Priya10aInjectable recombinant block polymer gel for sustained delivery of therapeutic protein in post traumatic osteoarthritis  aProtein-based biomaterials offer several advantages over synthetic materials, owing to their unique stimuli-responsive properties, biocompatibility and modular nature. Here, we demonstrate that E₅C, a recombinant protein block polymer, consisting of five repeats of elastin like polypeptide (E) and a coiled-coil domain of cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (C), is capable of forming a porous networked gel at physiological temperature, making it an excellent candidate for injectable biomaterials. Combination of E₅C with Atsttrin, a chondroprotective engineered derivative of anti-inflammatory growth factor progranulin, provides a unique biochemical and biomechanical environment to protect against post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA) onset and progression. E₅C gel was demonstrated to provide prolonged release of Atsttrin and inhibit chondrocyte catabolism while facilitating anabolic signaling in vitro. We also provide in vivo evidence that prophylactic and therapeutic application of Atsttrin-loaded E₅C gels protected against PTOA onset and progression in a rabbit anterior cruciate ligament transection model. Collectively, we have developed a unique protein-based gel capable of minimally invasive, sustained delivery of prospective therapeutics, particularly the progranulin-derivative Atsttrin, for therapeutic application in OA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanterior cruciate ligament 3abiocompatibility 3abiocompatible materials 3abiomechanics 3acartilage 3acatabolism 3aelastin 3agels 3amodels 3aosteoarthritis 3apolymers 3apolypeptides 3arabbits 3arecombinant proteins 3atemperature 3atherapeutics 0aInjectable protein engineered gels 0aProgranulin 0aAtsttrin 0aPost traumatic osteoarthritis 0aRabbit anterior cruciate ligament transection model 0aSustained delivery 0aRecombinant block polymer gels1 aHettinghouse, Aubryanna1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7596-63151 aMeleties, Michael1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1621-98351 aHasan, Sadaf1 aChen, Changhong1 aCui, Min1 aSun, Guodong1 aMenon, Rajiv1 aLin, Bonnie1 aRegatte, Ravinder1 aMontclare, Jin Kim1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6857-35911 aLiu, Chuan-ju1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7181-80320 tBiomaterials.g2022 Feb., v. 281 p.121370-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11782x0142-96127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2022.1213703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03331naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245012300163300001600286520152200302592002801824650002001852650001901872650002001891650003201911650001701943650001501960650001401975650003101989650001802020650002202038650002202060650001802082650001302100650001602113650001402129650001602143650001302159650001802172650001502190653001602205653002102221653002002242653002202262653002702284653002802311700001402339700001502353700005502368700001202423700001602435700001302451700001602464700001502480700001902495773009702514856008502611852000902696655001202705IND60619115620221121001637.0210114e20190201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061911562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.watres.2018.08.0742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Yi10aComparative study on degradation of propranolol and formation of oxidation products by UV/H2O2 and UV/persulfate (PDS)  ap. 543-552.  aThe frequent detection of propranolol, a widely used β-blocker, in wastewater effluents and surface waters has raised serious concern, due to its adverse effects on organisms. UV/hydrogen peroxide (UV/H₂O₂) and UV/persulfate (UV/PDS) processes are efficient in eliminating propranolol in various waters, but the formation of oxidation products in these processes, as well as the assessment of their toxicity, has not been systematically addressed. In this study, we identified and compared transformation products of propranolol produced by hydroxyl radical (•OH) and sulfate radical (SO₄•⁻). The electrostatic attraction enhances the reaction between SO₄•⁻ and the protonated form of propranolol, while •OH shows non-selectivity toward both protonated and neutral propranolol species. The hydroxylation of propranolol by •OH occurs at either amine moiety or naphthalene group while SO₄•⁻ favors the oxidation of the electron-rich naphthalene group. Further oxidation by •OH and SO₄•⁻ results in ring-opening products. Bicarbonate and chloride exert no effect on propranolol degradation. The generation of CO₃•⁻ and Cl-containing radicals is favorable to oxidizing naphthalene group. The acute toxicity assay of Vibrio fischeri suggests that SO₄•⁻ generates more toxic products than •OH, while CO₃•⁻ and Cl-containing radicals produce similar toxicity as SO₄•⁻. High concentrations of bicarbonate in UV/H₂O₂ increase the toxicity of treated solution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVibrio fischeri 3aacute toxicity 3aadverse effects 3abeta-adrenergic antagonists 3abicarbonates 3acarbonates 3aeffluents 3aelectrostatic interactions 3afree radicals 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ahydroxyl radicals 3ahydroxylation 3amoieties 3anaphthalene 3aoxidation 3apropranolol 3asulfates 3asurface water 3awastewater 0aPropranolol 0aHydroxyl radical 0aSulfate radical 0aCarbonate radical 0aCl-containing radicals 0aTransformation products1 aCao, Ying1 aJiang, Jin1 aLu, Xinglin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0229-77121 aMa, Jun1 aPang, Suyan1 aLi, Juan1 aLiu, Yongze1 aZhou, Yang1 aGuan, Chaoting0 tWater research.g2019 Feb. 01, v. 149 p.543-552dElsevier LtdwJournal:1966x0043-13547nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2018.08.0743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02295naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245006000165300001600225520104900241592002801290650002601318650001901344650001801363650001301381650003101394650001201425650002801437650001901465650001701484650001501501653003501516653002601551653003301577653003501610653001901645653002001664700001701684773008201701856008101783852000901864655001201873IND60480710320221118102159.0170124e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048071032DNAL7 a10.1007/s11434-015-0968-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCai, Hongming10aMass-independent fractionation of even mercury isotopes  ap. 116-124.  aPractically all physical, chemical, and biological processes can induce mass-dependent fractionation of mercury (Hg) isotopes. A few special processes such as photochemical reduction of Hg(II) and photochemical degradation of methylmercury (MeHg) can produce mass-independent fractionation (MIF) of odd Hg isotopes (odd-MIF), which had been largely reported in variable natural samples and laboratory experiments, and was thought to be caused by either nuclear volume effect or magnetic isotope effect. Recently, intriguing MIF of even Hg isotopes (even-MIF) had been determined in natural samples mainly related to the atmosphere. Though photo-oxidation in the tropopause (inter-layer between the stratosphere and the troposphere) and neutron capture in space were thought to be the possible processes causing even-MIF, the exact mechanism triggering significant even Hg isotope anomaly is still unclear. Even-MIF could provide useful information about the atmospheric chemistry and related climate changes, and the biogeochemical cycle of Hg.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatmospheric chemistry 3aclimate change 3afractionation 3aisotopes 3alaboratory experimentation 3amercury 3amethylmercury compounds 3aphotooxidation 3astratosphere 3atropopause 0aMass-independent fractionation 0aEven mercury isotopes 0aProcesses producing even-MIF 0aMechanisms triggering even-MIF 0aSelf-shielding 0aNeutron capture1 aChen, Jiubin0 tScience bulletin.g2016 Jan., v. 61 p.116-124dElsevier B.V.x2095-92737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11434-015-0968-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02288naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245007100166300001600237520097300253592002801226650002201254650002101276650001401297650001501311650001201326650002301338650001301361653002401374653002501398653002201423653002401445653002601469700001401495700001601509700001701525700001601542700001901558700001301577700001701590700002001607700001901627773008201646856008101728852000901809655001201818IND60480710420221118102133.0170124e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048071042DNAL7 a10.1007/s11434-015-0979-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeng, Lin-Long10aStereomeric effects of bisPC71BM on polymer solar cell performance  ap. 132-138.  aTwo stereomers of bisadduct analogues of [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (bisPC71BM) were synthesized and their geometrical structures with cis- or trans-configuration were identified by X-ray crystallography.

This area has a great importance due to its rich paleontology, archeology and speleology. The region is groundwater dependent, and it has been suffering pressure by economic development. Therefore, it is important to identify vulnerable areas in which infiltration of contaminants is likely to happen. The main goal of this study was to create an intrinsic groundwater contamination vulnerability map (scale 1:50.000), which will be used to assist the implantation of groundwater monitoring net project in the area. The index vulnerability was evaluated by analyzing COP model parameters through geoprocessing techniques. However, in order to adapt the method to the studied area conditions, changes in frame and values of input parameter weights (lithology and slope/vegetation) were necessary. The outcomes showed five categories of groundwater contamination vulnerable zones: high to the highest vulnerability level (10.95%), moderated (58.77%) and low to the lowest vulnerability (30.28%). Despite the low percentage of high to the highest vulnerably level area, they must be considered by environmental managers due to strong relationship between superficial and groundwater in the area.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3aarchaeology 3aeconomic development 3aenvironmental protection 3ageographic information systems 3agroundwater 3agroundwater contamination 3akarsts 3amodels 3amonitoring 3apaleontology 3avegetation 3aBrazil1 aVelásques, LeilaNunes Menegasse0 tEnvironmental earth sciences.g2017 July, v. 76, no. 13 p.445-445dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000001228x1866-62807nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-017-6760-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02540naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245011000173300001800283520111900301592002801420650001301448650002301461650002101484650001201505650001101517650001401528650002601542650001301568650002401581650001601605650001301621650002301634650002301657653002301680653003801703653001601741653001401757653002101771700003301792700002501825773013801850856008501988852000902073655001202082IND60573633420221119140330.0170724e20170803xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057363342DNAL7 a10.1080/10942912.2016.12225882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMedjoudj, Hacène10aProteolysis and volatile profile in the Algerian traditional Bouhezza cheese made using raw goat’s milk  ap. 1876-1893.  aBouhezza is an Algerian cheese, which is ripened in a goat-skin bag, called Chekoua . The aim of the study was to determine the protein profiles and aromatics, which contribute to sensory properties of Bouhezza cheese. The chemical composition, proteolysis, and volatile profile have been carried out in cheese made from raw goat milk. The results showed that, the dry matter ranged from 23.07 to 51.95%, the fat-in-dry matter ranged from 10.58 to 31.77%, and the protein ranged from 28.27 to 42.09%. Water-soluble and 12% trichloroacetic acid-soluble nitrogen fractions decreased at the beginning of the ripening process and then they increased until the end of ripening. The reverse phase-high-performance liquid chromatography peptide profiles of the cheese showed the modifications occurred during the ripening process. The volatile compounds showed a diversity of odorous components which contribute to give to the cheese its particular organoleptic. There were 109 compounds identified in Bouhezza cheese. Carboxylic acids, esters, and alcohols were the main classes of the volatile components in the cheese.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalcohols 3aaromatic compounds 3acarboxylic acids 3acheeses 3aesters 3agoat milk 3aliquid chromatography 3anitrogen 3aprotein composition 3aproteolysis 3aripening 3asensory properties 3avolatile compounds 0aSkin-bag (Chekoua) 0aBouhezza cheese goat’s raw milk 0aProteolysis 0aLipolysis 0aAromatic profile1 aZidoune, Mohammed Nasreddine1 aHayaloglu, Ali Adnan0 tInternational journal of food properties.g2017 Aug. 3, v. 20, no. 8 p.1876-1893dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl56717x1094-29127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10942912.2016.12225883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02602naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024002200117024001900139040001800158100002800176245010600204300001500310520118800325592002801513650000801541650001701549650002101566650001901587650002001606650001401626650001001640650001401650650001501664650001401679700001901693700002401712700001801736700002101754700002801775773015201803856007001955856009902025990002302124852000902147655001202156IND60608520320221120111500.0190510e20170218xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060852032DNAL7 a10.3791/552842doi7 aPMC54093362pmcid7 a282875742pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJulich-Haertel, Henrike10aIsolation and enrichment of liver progenitor subsets identified by a novel surface marker combination  ap. e55284.  aDuring chronic liver injuries, progenitor cells expand in a process called ductular reaction, which also entails the appearance of inflammatory cellular infiltrate and epithelial cell activation. The progenitor cell population during such inflammatory reactions has mostly been investigated using single surface markers, either by histological analysis or by flow cytometry-based techniques. However, novel surface markers identified various functionally distinct subsets within the liver progenitor/stem cell compartment. The method presented here describes the isolation and detailed flow cytometry analysis of progenitor subsets using novel surface marker combinations. Moreover, it demonstrates how the various progenitor cell subsets can be isolated with high purity using automated magnetic and FACS sorting-based methods. Importantly, novel and simplified enzymatic dissociation of the liver allows for the isolation of these rare cell populations with a high viability that is superior in comparison to other existing methods. This is especially relevant for further studying progenitor cells in vitro or for isolating high-quality RNA to analyze the gene expression profile.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA 3adissociation 3aepithelial cells 3aflow cytometry 3agene expression 3ahistology 3aliver 3amagnetism 3astem cells 3aviability1 aTiwari, Marina1 aMehrfeld, Christina1 aKrause, Elmar1 aKornek, Miroslaw1 aLukacs-Kornek, Veronika0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2017 Feb. 18, , no. 120 p.e55284-e55284dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3791/552843Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/55284/isolation-enrichment-liver-progenitor-subsets-identified-novel  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02297naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002800151245009000179300001800269520097100287592002801258650001301286650001201299650001201311650001601323650001301339650001301352650001201365650002301377650000901400650002401409650001401433650001701447653001501464653002001479653002101499653002101520653003001541700002401571700002401595773013801619856008501757852000901842655001201851IND60573633620221119140352.0170724e20170803xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057363362DNAL7 a10.1080/10942912.2016.12231272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJungtheerapanich, Sunee10aAging kinetics of low amylose rice during storage at ambient and chilled temperatures  ap. 1904-1912.  aThe objectives of this study were to monitor the changes in rice properties during aging and to compare kinetic parameters related to some of those changes. Paddy of three low amylose rice varieties was stored at ambient (30 ± 2ºC) and chilled (8 ± 2ºC) temperatures for 9 and 18 months, respectively. Aging led to a decrease in solid loss, peak viscosity, breakdown, and adhesiveness and an increase in head rice yield, minimum cooking time, water uptake, volume expansion, pasting temperature, final viscosity, through viscosity, setback, and hardness. Low temperature storage efficiently retarded those changes. Data of the time-dependent changes in hardness, adhesiveness, pasting temperature, peak viscosity, and breakdown of all samples stored at 30°C were fitted well with the first-order fractional conversion kinetic model (R ² = 0.77 – 0.98). Higher storage temperature resulted in greater rate constant (k ; up to 9 times higher) of those changes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3aamylose 3acooking 3agrain yield 3ahardness 3akinetics 3apaddies 3apasting properties 3arice 3astorage temperature 3aviscosity 3awater uptake 0aRice aging 0aCooking quality 0aPasting property 0aThermal property 0aFirst-order kinetic model1 aTananuwong, Kanitha1 aAnuntagool, Jirarat0 tInternational journal of food properties.g2017 Aug. 3, v. 20, no. 8 p.1904-1912dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl56717x1094-29127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10942912.2016.12231273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02701naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002400152245011000176300001600286520110400302592002801406650001601434650002401450650001301474650001501487650001601502650001901518650001201537650001301549650001901562650001601581650001101597650002401608650002001632650002001652650001301672650001101685653004101696653001301737653002001750653001201770653002301782653001601805653001601821653001901837700002401856700002301880700002501903700002301928773010001951856008702051852000902138655001202147IND60586219520221122220306.0190402e20180425xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058621952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2017.11.0532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFerreira, Sónia S.10aMicrowave assisted dehydration of broccoli by-products and simultaneous extraction of bioactive compounds  ap. 386-393.  aBroccoli by-products from frozen-food industry account for 45% of the initial broccoli heads. They consist on stalks, inflorescences, and leaves, blanched and non-blanched, sharing the nutritional value and bioactive compounds of commercial broccoli heads. However, their high perishability prevents further valorisation. Therefore, in this study microwave hydrodiffusion and gravity (MHG) technology was used to dehydrate broccoli by-products and simultaneously recover the water-soluble diffused compounds for food ingredients use. The hydrodiffusion allowed to obtain a dried material with 12% moisture in 43 min when 550 g of broccoli by-products were used, preserving polysaccharides and proteins. Diffused water contained up to 317 µg/mL gallic acid equivalents of phenolic compounds, 11 mg/mL free sugars, 9 mg/mL amino acids, and 356 µg/mL glucosinolates, depending on the type of by-product used. These results show the potential of MHG technology for valorisation of broccoli by-products by its simultaneous stabilization by dehydration and extraction of bioactive compounds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acids 3abioactive compounds 3abroccoli 3abyproducts 3agallic acid 3aglucosinolates 3agravity 3aindustry 3ainflorescences 3aingredients 3aleaves 3amicrowave treatment 3anutritive value 3apolysaccharides 3aproteins 3asugars 0aMicrowave hydrodiffusion and gravity 0aBrassica 0aPolysaccharides 0aProtein 0aPhenolic compounds 0aFree sugars 0aAmino acids 0aGlucosinolates1 aPassos, Cláudia P.1 aCardoso, Susana M.1 aWessel, Dulcineia F.1 aCoimbra, Manuel A.0 tFood chemistry.g2018 Apr. 25, v. 246 p.386-393dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2017.11.0533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02691naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245014000169520139000309592002801699650001701727650002201744650002501766650001401791650001501805650001701820650000901837650001201846650001701858650001701875650001701892651001201909653002601921653002201947653002701969653001501996653001202011653001702023700002502040773009802065856008502163852000902248655001202257IND60763003420221117225315.0220509e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076300342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apgeog.2022.1026402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHulke, Carolin10aUnderstanding regional value chain evolution in peripheral areas through governance interactions – An institutional layering approach  aDue to ‘dark sides’ of global value chain integration, a growing body of literature engages with regional value chains (RVC) as alternative strategy for inclusive regional development. To date, we know little about the conditions and actors under which RVCs evolve. Research dominantly highlights the role of regional lead firms, such as supermarket chains in food RVC, and state interventions. However, the role of other stakeholders such as public organisations and civil society at the local remains unclear. Therefore, the embeddedness of RVCs in multiple institutional layers and their exposure to institutional change needs consideration to understand how they evolve. The analysis of an emerging horticulture RVC in Namibia allows disentangling the interactions of state-driven market protection, firm-driven standardisation, and civil-society-driven collective action by analysing the processes of institutional layering underlying value chain governance. This study asks (1) how public, private and civil society governance forms hamper or foster the expansion of RVCs, and (2) how the layering of various institutions can create synergies rather than frictions. The case study helps to develop a grounded understanding of multi-layered governance, which is a crucial step to understand how RVCs can contribute to inclusive economic development in peripheral, rural areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3acollective action 3aeconomic development 3ageography 3agovernance 3ahorticulture 3alead 3asociety 3astakeholders 3asupermarkets 3asupply chain 3aNamibia 0aRegional value chains 0aRural development 0aInstitutional layering 0aGovernance 0aNamibia 0aHorticulture1 aRevilla Diez, Javier0 tApplied geography.g2022 Feb., v. 139 p.102640-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11785x0143-62287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeog.2022.1026403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03795naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245016300160300001100323520239800334592002802732650001802760650002502778650001602803650002002819650001202839650002002851650001002871650001702881650004302898650002102941650001802962650001402980650001302994650002603007651001003033700001403043700002103057700001803078700002003096700002003116773011103136856008103247852000903328655001203337IND60480710920221118102128.0160218e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048071092DNAL7 a10.1007/s11738-015-2049-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Jia10aCorrelation of cultivation time of Panax ginseng with metabolic profiles of nine ginsenosides and mRNA expression of genes encoding major biosynthetic enzymes  ap. 51.  aGinseng (Panax ginseng C. A. Meyer) is one of the most important Chinese medicinal herbs. This medicinal plant produces numerous bioactive substances, including triterpene saponins of the ginsenoside-type. The endogenous levels of all types of ginsenosides largely determine the therapeutic quality of P. ginseng. Here, a field investigation was conducted to compare the changes in ginsenoside composition and mRNA expression levels of some key genes in the biosynthetic pathway of P. ginseng seedlings cultivated for different times (1, 2, 3 or 4 years). After establishing a high performance liquid chromatography method to simultaneously determine nine different ginsenosides, we measured the variations of ginsenoside contents in P. ginseng seedlings collected from our field base in Jilin province, China. The levels of total ginsenosides obviously increased with longer cultivation times and reached peak values in the 4-year seedlings. In light of the changes of ginsenosides composition, protopanaxatriol (PPT)-type ginsenosides displayed a synchronized change with total ones, while the peak point of protopanaxadiol (PPD)-type ginsenoside contents appeared in the 3-year plants. Transcript analyses of squalene synthase (SS), squalene epoxidase (SQE1) and dammarenediol synthase (DS), which are the rate-limiting enzymes in the ginsenoside biosynthetic pathway, showed that the gene expression levels of PgSS and PgSQE1 were highest in the 2-year seedlings, and could indirectly control saponins. While the PgDS gene was highly expressed in 4-year plants, and another important gene pleiotropic drug resistance (PgPDR) has a consistent trend. The further correlation analysis between gene expressions and metabolic changes showed that PgDS transcript level significantly correlated with PPT-type ginsenosides, Rg1, Re, and Rf. PgPDR expression levels positively correlated with total ginsenoside, Rg1, Re, and Rb1 (p < 0.01) and Rg3 negatively correlated with PgDS and PgPDR genes expression (p < 0.01). However, the PgSS gene expression was negatively correlated with Rb1 (p < 0.05). In conclusion, we propose that PPT-type ginsenoside and PPD or dammarenediol-II compounds have a close relationship. Particularly, we highlight recent reports on functional characterization of key genes dedicated to the production of ginsenosides in P. ginseng seedling with cultivated time.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPanax ginseng 3abiochemical pathways 3acorrelation 3adrug resistance 3aenzymes 3agene expression 3agenes 3aginsenosides 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3amedicinal plants 3amessenger RNA 3aseedlings 3asqualene 3atriterpenoid saponins 3aChina1 aLiu, Yang1 aZhang, Zhong-Hua1 aZu, Yuan-Gang1 aTang, Zhong-Hua1 aEfferth, Thomas0 tActa physiologiae plantarum.g2016 Feb., v. 38, no. 2 p.51-51dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0137-58817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11738-015-2049-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01850naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024003800129040001800167100001800185245011900203300001600322500001500338520063700353592002800990650001701018650001401035650002501049650004001074650001401114650001601128651001001144651001001154651001501164653003001179700002001209700001901229700001801248773009601266856008101362852000901443655001201452IND60517748020221120091017.0160405e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051774802DNAL7 a10.1007/s00705-015-2707-52doi7 a10.1007/s00705-015-2707-52chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFrench, J.

TSWV also causes sporadic problems in a number of crops in New Mexico (NM). Nucleocapsid gene sequences obtained from six different crop species across the state over four different years were used to characterize the NM TSWV population. This analysis shows that NM is affected by a unique TSWV population that is part of larger independent population present in the southwestern US. This population likely arose due to geographic isolation and is related to other TSWV populations from the US, Spain, and Italy.  aPublisher supplied data 3anucleocapsid 3anew crops 3anucleotide sequences 3aTomato spotted wilt orthotospovirus 3apathogens 3agreenhouses 3aItaly 3aSpain 3aNew Mexico 0aTomato spotted wilt virus1 aGoldberg, N.

The objective of this study was therefore to develop a mass spectrometric approach for the detection of contamination with shrimp and lobster, two economically important types of crustaceans, in complex food matrices. Following a biomarker approach, we identified proteotypic peptides and developed a multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) method allowing for the identification and differentiation of shrimp and lobster in the food matrix at concentrations down to 0.1%. To further enhance sensitivity, we employed the MRM-cubed (MRM³) mode, which allowed us to detect crustaceans down to concentrations of 25 μg/g (crustacean/food, 0.0025%). We hereby present the first mass spectrometric method for the detection of shrimp and lobster in food matrices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCrustacea 3aadults 3aallergens 3abiomarkers 3afood allergies 3afood matrix 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3alobsters 3amass spectrometry 3amonitoring 3apeptides 3ashellfish 3ashrimp 0afood allergens 0acrustacean allergy 0amass spectrometry 0aMRM cubed 0amarker peptides1 aMonneuse, Jean-Marc1 aGemrot, Elodie1 aMetton, Isabelle1 aHumpf, Hans-Ulrich1 aBrockmeyer, Jens0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2016 Aug. 10, v. 64, no. 31 p.6219-6227dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jafc.6b026203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02419naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001900153245014100172300001800313520089300331592002801224650002201252650001901274650001501293650002101308650001501329650002001344650001001364650001401374650001801388650001801406650001401424650001201438650002501450650001201475650001301487650002001500650000901520700002301529700001901552700002101571700002401592700002201616700002201638700002101660700002401681773010001705856008701805852000901892655001201901IND60088560420221122234535.0141102e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008856042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.marpolbul.2012.06.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMottin, Elmina10aEffect of zinc sacrificial anode degradation on the defence system of the Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas: Chronic and acute exposures  ap. 1911-1920.  aTwo types of exposures were performed to assess the effects of zinc released from sacrificial anode degradation: a chronic exposure, in which oysters were exposed to 0.53±0.04mgZnL⁻¹ for 10weeks, and an acute exposure, where oysters were exposed to 10.2±1.2mgZnL⁻¹ for 1week. At the end of the acute exposure experiment, 81.8% mortality was recorded. In contrast, no mortality was detected after 10weeks exposure. Moreover, all of the immune system biomarkers studied, except the number of circulating haemocytes, were stimulated by a moderate level of zinc and inhibited by a high level. Our exposure conditions did not induce SOD or MXR mRNA expression in gills and digestive gland. However, an increase of MT mRNA is observed in these tissues. The results indicate that oysters are sensitive to acute zinc toxicity but are only moderately affected by a mild zinc concentration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCrassostrea gigas 3aacute exposure 3abiomarkers 3achronic exposure 3aelectrodes 3agene expression 3agills 3ahemocytes 3aimmune system 3amessenger RNA 3amortality 3aoysters 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atissues 3atoxicity 3awater pollution 3azinc1 aCaplat, Christelle1 aLatire, Thomas1 aMottier, Antoine1 aMahaut, Marie-Laure1 aCostil, Katherine1 aBarillier, Daniel1 aLebel, Jean-Marc1 aSerpentini, Antoine0 tMarine pollution bulletin.g2012 Sept., v. 64, no. 9 p.1911-1920dElsevier Ltdx0025-326X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2012.06.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02340naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245008400170520114600254592002801400650001401428650001801442650001301460650001701473650001701490650001301507653001201520653001501532653001401547653001501561653001401576653001701590653001101607653000701618700001701625700002101642700002101663700003101684773010801715856008601823852000901909655001201918IND60763003720221117225306.0220523e20220415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076300372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2021.1190402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAiello, Ashlee10aMesoporous xerogel cellulose composites from biorenewable natural cotton fibers  aAll-cellulose xerogel composites were fabricated using a facile, scalable three-step process—(1) partial ionic liquid dissolution, (2) non-solvent rinsing, and (3) drying. The xerogel composites are composed of two phases where the yarn center is non-porous highly crystalline cellulose I surrounded by mesoporous amorphous regenerated cellulose. The composite had high 149 m² g⁻¹ Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area with 11.7 nm average pore diameter. The porosity was calculated using density-based (ϕᵨ = 0.49) and volume-based (ϕV = 0.52) methods. The porosity evolution mechanism is attributed to non-solvent-induced polarity shifts, and these results are compared with non-porous morphologies produced by varying the choice in non-solvents. Although similar decrystallization behavior was measured for all samples, non-porous yarns had a smaller diameter and significantly reduced BET surface area (0.03 m² g⁻¹). The presented fabrication method offers controllable mesoporous phase formation along with freestanding structural capability towards the development of advanced functional cellulosic materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3acellulose 3aionic liquids 3aporosity 3aporous media 3asurface area 3axerogels 0aXerogel 0aMesoporous 0aCellulose 0aBiopolymer 0aComposite 0aIonic Liquid 0aEMImAc 0aIL1 aCosby, Tyler1 aMcFarland, Julia1 aDurkin, David P.1 aTrulove, P.

Both photochemical and microbial reactions contributed to the transformation of APAP under irradiance of 1.0–250 mW/cm². Microbial compositions were significantly different among surface water, and same microbial transformation product (1,4-bezoquinone) was detected as the predominant biotransformation intermediate in four studied surface water, but the lag phase (12−50-h) for the transformation was highly dependent on the aquatic microbial abundance and composition. The lag phase no longer existed with irradiance increased to 5.9 mW/cm². Aquatic microbial abundance and composition were influenced by the presence of APAP and radiation, and the influence extent was dependent on microbial species. The findings demonstrated that the individual contribution of biotic and abiotic process to the overall transformation of APAP and maybe other phenol in surface water varied as the background composition of surface water and the external environment changed, and biotransformation dominated (>73%) the overall transformation of APAP in surface water.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetaminophen 3abiotransformation 3alakes 3alight intensity 3amicroorganisms 3aphenol 3aphotochemistry 3aquinones 3asurface water 3aYangtze River 0aAcetaminophen 0aAquatic microbes 0aBiotransformation 0aPhoto-transformation 0aSurface water1 aZhou, Qing1 aZhang, Xu0 tWater research.g2019 Jan. 01, v. 148 p.133-141dElsevier LtdwJournal:1966x0043-13547nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2018.10.0423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01955naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245006900170300001500239520095100254592002801205650001901233650002001252650003301272650001001305650001201315650001401327650001101341650001301352650002601365650001101391700002001402773009301422856008101515852000901596655001201605IND60480711420221118102152.0160129e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048071142DNAL7 a10.1007/s12033-015-9910-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAntošová, Zuzana10aYeast Hosts for the Production of Recombinant Laccases: A Review  ap. 93-116.  aLaccases are multi-copper oxidoreductases which catalyze the oxidation of a wide range of substrates during the simultaneous reduction of oxygen to water. These enzymes, originally found in fungi, plants, and other natural sources, have many industrial and biotechnological applications. They are used in the food, textile, pulp, and paper industries, as well as for bioremediation purposes. Although natural hosts can provide relatively high levels of active laccases after production optimization, heterologous expression can bring, moreover, engineered enzymes with desired properties, such as different substrate specificity or improved stability. Hence, diverse hosts suitable for laccase production are reviewed here, while the greatest emphasis is placed on yeasts which are commonly used for industrial production of various proteins. Different approaches to optimize the laccase expression and activity are also discussed in detail here.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioremediation 3agene expression 3aheterologous gene expression 3ahosts 3alaccase 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3aproteins 3asubstrate specificity 3ayeasts1 aSychrová, Hana0 tMolecular biotechnology.g2016 Feb., v. 58, no. 2 p.93-116dSpringer USx1073-60857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12033-015-9910-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02254naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245010000162300001800262520106500280592002801345650001701373650001101390650001401401650002801415650002501443650001401468650002301482650001401505651001001519651001001529651001101539700001401550700001801564700001601582700001301598700001701611700001601628773009801644856008101742852000901823655001201832IND60517748520221120091046.0160405e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051774852DNAL7 a10.1007/s00705-015-2734-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Heng10aComplete genome sequence of a Chuzan virus strain isolated for the first time in mainland China  ap. 1073-1077.  aChuzan virus (CHUV) belongs to the Palyam serogroup, causes bovine congenital disease, and is prevalent in Asia. To date, only one full Palyam virus (PALV) genome sequence, that of Japanese CHUV strain K47, has been reported. Sequence analysis indicates that PALV strains isolated from different geographical regions show significant diversity, which is mainly shaped by geographically independent evolution and genetic reassortment. Our understanding of the genetic characteristics of PALV is hampered by a very limited genomic sequence database. In this study, we report the complete genome sequence of CHUV strain SZ187, which was isolated for the first time in 2012 in mainland China. Sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis demonstrate that SZ187 is closely related to other CHUV strains isolated in Taiwan and Japan, indicating that they may share a common ancestor. This new full-length CHUV genome sequence could help in the design of broader assays for epidemiological studies and facilitate the identification of new CHUV isolates in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPalyam virus 3acattle 3adatabases 3aepidemiological studies 3anucleotide sequences 3aphylogeny 3asequence alignment 3aserotypes 3aChina 3aJapan 3aTaiwan1 aXiao, Lei1 aMeng, Jinxing1 aXiong, Heli1 aGao, Lin1 aLiao, Defang1 aLi, Huachun0 tArchives of virology.g2016 Apr., v. 161, no. 4 p.1073-1077dSpringer Viennax0304-86087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00705-015-2734-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02081naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002700146245012300173300001800296520087800314592002801192650002401220650002101244650002101265650001201286650001701298650001701315650001001332653002401342653001601366653001201382653001101394653001401405653003001419700002201449773013301471856008201604852000901686655001201695IND60549339920170206000000.0160908e20160817xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054933992DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.6b016382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFranco-Luesma, Ernesto10aFormation and Release of H2S, Methanethiol, and Dimethylsulfide during the Anoxic Storage of Wines at Room Temperature  ap. 6317-6326.  aA total of 21 different wines (13 reds, 5 whites, and 3 rosés) were kept at 25 °C in anoxia for 379 days. Free and total forms of H₂S and methanethiol (MeSH) and dimethylsulfide (DMS) were measured initially and after 117, 221, and 379 days of storage. Levels of free H₂S, free and total MeSH, and DMS continuously increased during storage, while levels of total H₂S remained essentially unchanged. Average increases of free H₂S amount to 6.2 μg/L (from 1.1 to 12.9 μg/L), those of free MeSH to 1.6 μg/L (from 0.7 to 3.5 μg/L), and those of total MeSH to 1.9 μg/L (from 1.1 to 3.0 μg/L), whereas those of DMS were 27.8 μg/L (from 11 to 69 μg/L). The fraction of H₂S under free forms significantly increased, suggesting that release is a major factor explaining H₂S increases. All increases can be satisfactorily predicted from data obtained at 50 °C.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3adimethyl sulfide 3ahydrogen sulfide 3ahypoxia 3amethanethiol 3astorage time 3awines 0areductive off-odors 0asulfur-like 0asulfide 0acopper 0areduction 0asulfide−metal complexes1 aFerreira, Vicente0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2016 Aug. 17, v. 64, no. 32 p.6317-6326dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jafc.6b016383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03098naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003400147245011600181300001800297500002000315520127500335592002801610596001001638596002701648596002701675596007101702650001701773650001401790650001201804650001501816650002001831650001401851650001401865650001101879650002101890650001801911650002401929650002301953650001801976650001301994650001602007650001302023650001602036650002402052700003002076700003302106700004202139700003202181700002302213700005002236773015502286856008202441852000902523655001202532IND60574584420221120112940.0220804e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057458442DNAL7 a10.1007/s11746-017-3012-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBueno‐Borges, Larissa Braga12aA Highly Stable Soybean Oil‐Rich Miscella Obtained by Ethanolic Extraction as a Promising Biodiesel Feedstock  ap. 1101-1109.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aSoybean oil is industrially obtained upon hexane extraction. In biodiesel production, soybean oil is submitted to phospholipid removal in order to improve its quality before transesterification. An extraction process was employed to produce ethanolic oil‐rich miscella, which can be directly transesterified to produce biodiesel without prior refining. We assessed the oxidative stability of the miscella and three other soybean oils, namely degummed, alkali‐refined, and refined–bleached–deodorized (RBD) oil. In vitro antioxidant assays as well as the identification and quantification of tocopherols and isoflavones were also performed. Although hexane‐extracted oils showed higher tocopherol contents than miscella, this latter sample and its direct biodiesel demonstrated superior stability in accelerated tests. Miscella also outperformed hexane‐extracted oils in all in vitro assays. This behavior can be explained by the presence of phenolic compounds with higher affinity to ethanol than hexane, which was confirmed by the identification of isoflavones glycitein, genistein, and acetyldaidzin, found only in miscella. This study showed that the ethanolic extraction of soybean oil generated a highly stable lipid feedstock for biodiesel manufacture.  aPublisher supplied data  cCAPES  a2013/03650‐6cFAPESP  a2016/01956‐9cFAPESP  cNatural Science and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) of Canada 3aantioxidants 3abiodiesel 3aethanol 3afeedstocks 3afuel production 3agenistein 3aglycitein 3ahexane 3ain vitro studies 3amanufacturing 3aoxidative stability 3aphenolic compounds 3aphospholipids 3arefining 3asoybean oil 3asoybeans 3atocopherols 3atransesterification1 ade Camargo, Adriano Costa1 aSangaletti‐Gerhard, Naiane1 ados Santos, Grasiela Cristina Pereira1 ade Alencar, Severino Matias1 aShahidi, Fereidoon1 aRegitano‐d’Arce, Marisa Aparecida Bismara0 tThe journal of the American Oil Chemists' Society.g2017 Aug., v. 94, no. 8 p.1101-1109dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl49535x0003-021X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11746-017-3012-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03547naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245011800168520234000286592002802626650001102654650001402665650001002679650002302689650001102712650001502723650002002738650002102758650001002779651001802789700002102807700001802828700001602846700001902862700001902881700002102900773013402921856008503055852000903140655001203149IND60672875420221116142714.0191017e20190613xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067287542DNAL7 a10.1093/cdn/nzz052.OR32-08-192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhan, Naiman14aThe Effect of Hydration on Cognition in Children: The WITiKids Randomized Controlled Crossover Trial (OR32-08-19)  aPrevious work in adults has shown that dehydration has negative effects on cognitive function. However, the effect of changes in hydration on cognitive function remain understudied in children. This is relevant since epidemiological data suggests that a large proportion of children in the United States exhibit highly concentrated urine, suggestive of insufficient hydration. This study aimed to determine the effects of changes in daily water intake on urinary markers of hydration and cognitive control among school-aged children. 9–11-year-old children (N = 82) completed a three-intervention crossover water intake intervention where they were asked to either maintain their regular water intake (ad libitum) or consume High [2.5 L/d] or Low [0.5 L/d]) water for 4 consecutive days. Following the interventions, cognitive control tasks requiring inhibition, working memory, and cognitive flexibility were assessed using a modified flanker, Go/NoGo, and color-shape switch tasks. During day 4 of each intervention, children collected their urine over a 24-hour period for urine color, urine specific gravity (USG), and osmolality assessment. Hydration differed significantly between interventions. Urine color during the Low intervention was significantly higher than ad libitum and both were significantly greater than High intervention (Low: 6 [median] and 2 [iqr], ad libitum: 5 [median] and 2 [iqr], High: 3 [median] and 0 [iqr], all P ≤ 0.01). Similar intervention effects were observed for osmolality (Low: 912 ± 199, ad libitum: 790 ± 257.0, High: 260 ± 115 mOsmol/kg, all P < 0.001) and USG (Low: 1.023 ± 0.005, ad libitum: 1.020 ± 0.007, High: 1.005 ± 0.004, all P < 0.001). Ad libitumhydration was positively related to switch task performance. Benefits of the High intervention were observed during the switch task whereby participants exhibited lower working memory cost relative to the Low intervention. No significant changes in cognition were observed for the flanker and Go/NoGo tasks. Children with better habitual hydration exhibited superior performance during the cognitive flexibility task. Additionally, the 4d water intervention resulted in significant changes in urinary markers of hydration and had selective benefits during task switching.

The conversion of copper (Cu) and silver (Ag) into nanomaterial for biomedical application has increased the urge of working with different metallic nanoparticles. Considering these facts, zinc nanoparticles (ZnO) are synthesized using biological sources like plants, fruits, bacteria, fungi, algae etc. The introduction of biological sources for the synthesis of ZnONPs will promote a safer and non-toxic approach. The biomolecules present in biological sources act as capping or coating agents to enhance the stability and potentials of the ZnONPs. In the present study aqueous extract of Vitis rotundifolia (Hybrid Grapes) pulp is used for the synthesis of ZnO nanoparticles (ZnONPs). The structural and chemical characterization of the synthesized ZnONPs was performed using various analytical. The excitation of absorption peak at 371 nm confirmed the synthesis of ZnONPs. Morphological characterization confirmed the formation of irregular hexagonal, crystalline ZnONPs with an average size of 23.56 nm. ZnONPs were further taken for determining the photocatalytic degrading potential against Malachite Green (MG) dye. After 150 min of incubation under dark condition the dye was completely degraded. The present result clearly suggest that ZnONPs synthesized using hybrid grapes pulp extract (HGPE) could be an active candidate for removing carcinogenic and toxic chemical dyes released from textile and dye industries. Further expanding the application of HGPE-ZnONPs will promote a remarkable bioremediation application against water pollution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVitis rotundifolia 3aantioxidants 3abiochemical compounds 3abioremediation 3acarcinogenicity 3acopper 3acopper nanoparticles 3afabrics 3afruit extracts 3agrapes 3aindustry 3amalachite green 3ananosilver 3aphotocatalysis 3apulp 3asilver 3atoxic substances 3awater pollution 3azinc 3azinc oxide 0aHybrid grapes 0aZnO nanoparticles 0aPhotocatalytic activity1 aSamuel, Melvin S.1 aVerma, Tikendra Nath1 aVasantharaj, Seerangaraj1 aSathiyavimal, Selvam1 aSaravanan, Mythili1 aPugazhendhi, Arivalagan1 aDuc, Pham Anh0 tBiocatalysis and agricultural biotechnology.g2020 Sept., v. 28 p.101730-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6239x1878-81817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bcab.2020.1017303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02252naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100002100161245009800182300001600280500000900296520103000305592002801335650001301363650002801376650002701404650001601431650000901447650002001456650001501476650001901491650002101510650001501531650002301546700001801569700002701587773014701614856009601761852000901857655001201866IND60668596120221119191826.0191125e197405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066859612DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1974.03615995003800030022x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhasawneh, F.

The fertilizer dissolved in soil moisture that moved towards the application site. This water movement was sometimes against a gradient in soil moisture content, but it was along a gradient in the total potential of soil water. The extent of P movement from all three sources was similar, but the distribution patterns were different. The extent of P movement was influenced more by the initial soil moisture content than by the source of P. A higher fraction of the added P was precipitated when the source was TPP or APP than when it was DAP. The ability of the polyphosphates to sequester soil Fe and Al did not prevent the precipitation of these phosphates nor did it make them more mobile than the orthophosphates. It only delayed the precipitation reaction to a degree that depended on the polyphosphate content of the fertilizer material.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3aammonium polyphosphates 3achemical precipitation 3afertilizers 3airon 3aorthophosphates 3aphosphorus 3apolyphosphates 3asandy loam soils 3asoil water 3asoil water content1 aSample, E.

BSA immobilization increased the interlayer spacing of GO and led to the formation of capillaries. The column packed with PLGO adsorbent permeated water faster as much as ca. 5 fold as compared to only GO packed column. The PLGO composite was used to develop a solid phase extraction method for the selective preconcentration of As(III) in the presence of As(V), prior to their determination. As(III) binding to sulfhydryl groups of BSA in PLGO plays a key role in the speciation. The coexisting heavy metal ions did not hinder the recovery of trace As(III). The method was advantageously employed for the preconcentration of As(III), Pb(II), Cd(II), Zn(II), Cu(II) and Ni(II) from water and food samples. A 3 mL of 1 M hydrochloric acid would be adequate for the complete desorption (recovery > 99%) of the adsorbed metal ions. The preconcentration limit achieved for As(III), Pb(II), Cd(II), Zn(II), Cu(II) and Ni(II) were 1.7, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 1.8 and 2.0 μg L⁻¹ respectively, with an optimized sample flow rate of 10 mL min⁻¹.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aarsenic 3aarsenites 3abovine serum albumin 3acadmium 3acopper 3adesorption 3agraphene oxide 3aheavy metals 3alead 3ametal ions 3amoieties 3anickel 3asolid phase extraction 3asulfhydryl groups 3azinc 0aGraphene oxide 0aSpeciation 0aBovine serum albumin 0aToxicity1 aHuang, Zenan1 aKanagaraj, Palsamy1 aLiu, Changkun1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4709-90040 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2020 Feb. 15, v. 384 p.121479-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2019.1214793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03314naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003200133040001800165100002500183245009700208300001200305506007600317520172600393592002802119506003702147650001202184650001202196650001102208650001802219650001202237650001002249650001202259650001002271650001202281650001202293650004702305650002802352650001302380650005602393650001002449650002402459650004302483700001702526700002902543700001802572700002202590700002102612773009702633856004502730852000902775655001202784IND4471325320221207141734.0130327e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447132532DNAL7 a225510792pmid7 aPMC34621352pmcid7 a10.1186/1746-6148-8-502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZumstein, Matthias A10aDevice for lengthening of a musculotendinous unit by direct continuous traction in the sheep  ap. 415.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Retraction, atrophy and fatty infiltration are signs subsequent to chronic rotator cuff tendon tears. They are associated with an increased pennation angle and a shortening of the muscle fibers in series. These deleterious changes of the muscular architecture are not reversible with current repair techniques and are the main factors for failed rotator cuff tendon repair. Whereas fast stretching of the retracted musculotendinous unit results in proliferation of non-contractile fibrous tissue, slow stretching may lead to muscle regeneration in terms of sarcomerogenesis. To slowly stretch the retracted musculotendinous unit in a sheep model, two here described tensioning devices have been developed and mounted on the scapular spine of the sheep using an expandable threaded rod, which has been interposed between the retracted tendon end and the original insertion site at the humeral head. Traction is transmitted in line with the musculotendinous unit by sutures knotted on the expandable threaded rod. The threaded rod of the tensioner is driven within the body through a rotating axis, which enters the body on the opposite side. The tendon end, which was previously released (16 weeks prior) from its insertion site with a bone chip, was elongated with a velocity of 1 mm/day. RESULTS: After several steps of technical improvements, the tensioner proved to be capable of actively stretching the retracted and degenerated muscle back to the original length and to withstand the external forces acting on it. CONCLUSION: This technical report describes the experimental technique for continuous elongation of the musculotendinous unit and reversion of the length of chronically shortened muscle.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aatrophy 3ahumerus 3amodels 3amuscle fibers 3amuscles 3asheep 3asutures 3atears 3atendons 2aAnimals 2aAtrophyxprevention & controlxveterinary. 2aBiomechanical Phenomena 2aForelimb 2aMuscle, Skeletalxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aSheep 2aTendonsxphysiology 2aTractionxinstrumentationxveterinary.1 aFrey, Éric,1 avon Rechenberg, Brigitte1 aFrigg, Robert1 aGerber, Christian1 aMeyer, Dominik C0 tBMC veterinary research.g2012 Dec., v. 8, no. 1 p.415-415dSpringer-Verlagx1746-61487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1746-6148-8-50  aDNAL 7aarticle01451naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245011800161300001800279520034200297592002800639650001200667650002300679650002300702650002100725650001300746650003200759650003100791700002500822700002100847700002800868773013400896856007401030852000901104655001201113IND60660815120221120151204.0190827e20150122xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066081512DNAL7 a10.1039/c4cc09163a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLinke, Alexander10aPotent affinity material for tracing acetone and related analytes based on molecular recognition by halogen bonds  ap. 2040-2043.  aAffinity materials based on halogen bonds turned out to be a powerful tool for the molecular recognition of acetone or related carbonyl compounds in the presence of ubiquitous protic molecules.

A supported catalyst is a promising olefin oligomerization catalyst. In the work reported, a supported Fe₂O₃‐Cl/β‐zeolite molecular sieve catalyst was synthesized by changing the loading amount of various active components, and its catalytic effect on the selective oligomerization of isobutene was studied. The catalyst was characterized using various techniques. The experiments were carried out in a fixed bed reactor, and the effects of Fe loading, temperature and reaction space airspeed were studied. RESULTS: The catalyst has a good catalytic effect on this reaction with the load at 3%, the temperature at 70 °C, the pressure at 1 MPa and the reaction airspeed at 2 h⁻¹. CONCLUSIONS: The conversion of isobutene was above 90%, the selectivity of C8 was around 80% and the loss of n‐butene was very small. © 2022 Society of Chemical Industry (SCI).  aPublisher supplied data  a2018XSCC038cFocus on research and development plan in Yantai city  a2020KJC002cQingchuang science and technology plan innovation team of Shandong province  a2021ZDSYS24cthe Key Research and Development Plan of Shandong ProvinceMajor Scientific and Technological Innovation Project 3abiotechnology 3acatalysts 3aolefin 3aoligomerization 3atemperature1 aSun, Dahai1 aLichuanjushi,1 aTian, Hui1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1324-93020 tJournal of chemical technology and biotechnology.g2022 July, v. 97, no. 7 p.1893-1899dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.wJournal:jnl39259x0268-25757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jctb.70623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02858naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006000140245012300200500002000323520152200343592002801865650002401893650001701917650003001934650002601964650001501990650002502005650001502030650002202045650001502067650001202082650001702094650001302111650001402124650001902138650002002157650000902177651001602186700001702202773012202219856007402341852000902415655001202424IND60625701920221120040826.0181212e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062570192DNAL7 a10.1111/conl.125932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLinklater, Wayne1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2627-693X10aPredator Free 2050: A flawed conservation policy displaces higher priorities and better, evidence‐based alternatives  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aNew Zealand's policy to exterminate five introduced predators by 2050 is well‐meant but warrants critique and comparison against alternatives. The goal is unachievable with current or near‐future technologies and resources. Its effects on ecosystems and 26 other mammalian predators and herbivores will be complex. Some negative outcomes are likely. Predators are not always and everywhere the largest impact on biodiversity. Lower intensity predator suppression, habitat protection and restoration, and prey refugia will sometimes better support threatened biodiversity. The policy draws attention to where predators are easily killed, not where biodiversity values are greatest. Pest control operations are already contested and imposing the policy is likely to escalate those conflicts. While “high‐profile,” a focus on predator eradication obscures the fact that indigenous habitat cover and quality continues to decline. Thus, the policy is flawed and risks diverting effort and resources from higher environmental priorities and better alternatives. Biodiversity conservation policies should be guided by cost‐benefit analyses, prioritization schemes, and conservation planning in an adaptive management framework to deliver nuanced outcomes appropriate to scale‐ and site‐specific variation in biodiversity values and threats. The success of biodiversity sanctuary‐“spillover” landscapes, habitat restoration, and metapopulation management provide the foundation to build a better policy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadaptive management 3abiodiversity 3abiodiversity conservation 3acost benefit analysis 3aecosystems 3ahabitat conservation 3aherbivores 3aissues and policy 3alandscapes 3amammals 3apest control 3aplanning 3apredators 3aprioritization 3arefuge habitats 3arisk 3aNew Zealand1 aSteer, Jamie0 tConservation letters.g2018 Nov., v. 11, no. 6 p.e12593-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:J000000138x1755-263X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/conl.125933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02593naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245010700171300001600278520130400294592002801598650001901626650002401645650001601669650001101685650002901696650000901725651001101734651001601745653002701761653001501788653001901803653002401822653002501846653003301871700001501904700001601919700002301935700002001958773008801978856008402066852000902150655001202159IND60600454220221121221426.0180703e20140501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060045422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2014.03.0832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGöransson, Lisa10aLinkages between demand-side management and congestion in the European electricity transmission system  ap. 860-872.  aWe evaluate the possibility to reduce congestion in the transmission grid through large-scale implementation of demand-side management (DSM) in the form of load shifting for the EU-27 countries, Norway, and Switzerland for Year 2020. A linear, cost-minimising, dispatch model that includes a DC load-flow description of the transmission system and a general representation of load shifting is used. It is assumed that the EU Member States fulfil the targets for Year 2020 in their national renewable energy action plans. In the model calculations, a reference case without load shifting is compared with cases in which the load shifting is 5%, 10%, 15% or 20% of the load. The possibility to shift load in time is added exogenously and economic incentives for DSM are not evaluated.Three types of congestion are identified: peak-load-hour congestion, low-load-hour congestion and all-hour congestion. Peak-load-hour congestion is reduced as the DSM share of the load increases, whereas low-load-hour congestion, which is typically associated with a high level of wind generation, persists at all the DSM penetration levels investigated. We show that all-hour congestion occurs between systems that have large differences in supply structure, and that the impact of DSM on all-hour congestion is low.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3aeconomic incentives 3aelectricity 3amodels 3arenewable energy sources 3awind 3aNorway 3aSwitzerland 0aDemand-side management 0aCongestion 0aDispatch model 0aVariable generation 0aVariation management 0aElectricity system modelling1 aGoop, Joel1 aUnger, Th.,1 aOdenberger, Mikael1 aJohnsson, Filip0 tEnergy.g2014 May 01, v. 69 p.860-872dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2014.03.0833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03647naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001800142245008900160300001800249500000900267520195500276592002802231650002102259650004302280650001802323650001402341650001002355650001602365650001102381650001602392650002002408650002102428650002302449650001402472650001502486650001302501650002002514650001002534650002302544650001802567651000902585651001302594651001902607651001302626651001702639700002302656700002402679700002002703700002002723700002302743700002402766773019302790856007702983852000903060655001203069IND60666399120221120160119.0191028e200405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066639912DNAL7 a10.2134/jeq2004.11062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLory, John A.13aAn Assessment of Nitrogen-Based Manure Application Rates on 39 U.S. Swine Operations  ap. 1106-1113.  aepub  aWater quality concerns and revised regulations are changing how confined animal feeding operations manage manure. Devising acceptable and feasible changes in manure practices requires a full understanding of the forces shaping current manure management decisions. Previous theoretical models have shown that a wide range of factors influence the lowest cost solution for manure management. We used a mechanistic model to characterize the manure management practices on 39 swine operations (20 unagitated lagoon and 19 slurry operations) in five states (Iowa, Missouri, North Carolina, Oklahoma, and Pennsylvania). Information was collected from each operation about animal numbers, feed and water use, manure handling and storage characteristics, field locations, crop rotation, fertilizer need, and equipment inventory and usage. Collected data were used as input and to validate results from a mechanistic model that determined acres required for manure application, manure application rate, time required for manure application, value of manure, and costs of manure management. The 39 farms had a mean of 984 animal units (AU) per operation, 18.2 AU ha⁻¹ (7.4 AU acre⁻¹), and manure application costs of $10.49 AU⁻¹ yr⁻¹ Significant factors affecting manure management included operation size, manure handling system, state, and ownership structure. Larger operations had lower manure management costs (r ² = 0.32). Manure value potentially exceeded manure application costs on 58% of slurry and 15% of lagoon operations. But 38% of slurry operations needed to apply manure off the farm whereas all lagoon operations had sufficient land for N-based manure management. Manure management was a higher percentage of gross income on contract operations compared with independents (P < 0.01). This research emphasized the importance of site-specific factors affecting manure management decisions and the economics of U.S. swine operations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapplication rate 3aconcentrated animal feeding operations 3acrop rotation 3aequipment 3afarms 3afertilizers 3aincome 3ainventories 3amanure handling 3amanure spreading 3amechanistic models 3aownership 3apig manure 3aslurries 3astorage quality 3aswine 3atheoretical models 3awater quality 3aIowa 3aMissouri 3aNorth Carolina 3aOklahoma 3aPennsylvania1 aMassey, Raymond E.1 aZulovich, Joseph M.1 aHoehne, John A.1 aSchmidt, Amy M.1 aCarlson, Marcia S.1 aFulhage, Charles D.0 tJournal of environmental quality.g2004 May, v. 33, no. 3 p.1106-1113dAmerican Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, Soil Science SocietywJournal:jnl1642x1537-25377nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq2004.11063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03514naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001600149245013800165300001400303520164200317592002801959650001101987650001901998650002102017650003802038650002802076650002002104650001502124650001302139650001602152650002202168650002602190650002002216650002902236650001902265650001602284650000902300650002402309650002502333650001002358650001502368650002502383650002002408651001002428653001502438653002902453653002202482653001302504653002102517700001702538700001602555700002502571700002102596700001902617700001602636700001702652773011402669856008402783852000902867655001202876IND60591885320221118164153.0201202e20180430xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059188532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agwat.2018.03.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBastida, F.10aComparing the impacts of drip irrigation by freshwater and reclaimed wastewater on the soil microbial community of two citrus species  ap. 53-62.  aThe search for new water resources for irrigation is a mandatory requirement in Mediterranean agroecosystems. The impacts of irrigation with water from different origins were evaluated in the soil microbial community and plant physiology of grapefruit and mandarin trees in the south-east of Spain. The following treatments were considered: i) freshwater with an electrical conductivity (EC) of 1.0 dS m⁻¹ from the “Tagus-Segura” water-transfer canal and well (TW); ii) reclaimed water (EC = 3.21 dS m⁻¹) from a wastewater-treatment-plant (RW); iii) irrigation with TW, except in the second stage of fruit development, when RW was utilized (TWc); and iv) irrigation with RW except in the second stage, when TW was used (RWc). Phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) revealed that microbial biomass was higher in the grapefruit soil than in the mandarin soil. In grapefruit soil, TW treatment showed a lower bacterial PLFA content than RW, RWc, and TWc, while RW showed the lowest values in the mandarin soil. In grapefruit soil, β-glucosidase and cellobiohydrolase activities were greater in RW and TWc than in TW and RWc. Under mandarin, the greatest activity of these enzymes was recorded in the TWc treatment. The saline stress caused lower net photosynthesis (A) and stomatal conductance (gₛ) in plants of RW, RWc and TWc than in plants of TW treatment. The annual use of reclaimed water or the combined irrigation with TWc benefited microbial biomass and enzyme activities of grapefruit soil. In contrast, the microbial community of mandarin soil seemed more affected by the annual irrigation with reclaimed water.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCitrus 3aagroecosystems 3abeta-glucosidase 3acellulose 1,4-beta-cellobiosidase 3aelectrical conductivity 3aenzyme activity 3afreshwater 3afruiting 3agrapefruits 3amicrobial biomass 3amicrobial communities 3amicroirrigation 3aphospholipid fatty acids 3aphotosynthesis 3asalt stress 3asoil 3asoil microorganisms 3astomatal conductance 3atrees 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 3awater resources 3aSpain 0aIrrigation 0aSoil microbial community 0aEnzyme activities 0aSemiarid 0aPlant physiology1 aTorres, I.F.1 aAbadía, J.1 aRomero-Trigueros, C.1 aRuiz-Navarro, A.1 aAlarcón, J.J.1 aGarcía, C.1 aNicolás, E.0 tAgricultural water management.g2018 Apr. 30, v. 203 p.53-62dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8460x0378-37747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2018.03.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04306naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245016200173520252500335592002802860650002202888650001502910650001602925650001002941650001402951650002402965650001202989650001203001650002303013650001703036650002603053650002203079650001503101650001603116650002703132650001403159650003003173650002303203650002403226650003203250650002003282650002403302650001303326650001303339650001403352651001103366700001903377700001803396700002103414700001803435700001803453700001703471773013403488856008503622852000903707655001203716IND60672875920221116142703.0191017e20190613xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067287592DNAL7 a10.1093/cdn/nzz052.P14-005-192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGouskova, Natalia10aBlood-based Nutritional Risk Index for Cognition in the Nutrition and Brain Aging Study (NBAS): Emphasis on n-3 PUFA, Vitamin D and Homocysteine (P14-005-19)  aNutrients and their metabolites have interactive qualities that may be harnessed for prevention of cognitive decline. Simultaneous modulation of one-carbon, fatty acid and vitamin D metabolism (25-OH-D) may offer neuroprotection. We examined whether n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA), 25-OH-D, and homocysteine (HCy) formed into a Nutritional Risk Index (NRI) can explain cognitive performance of older non-demented adults. The NBAS enrolled older participants from the NIA-Layton Oregon Alzheimer's Disease Center aging studies with serum samples available yielding 306 cognitively characterized older adults. Plasma fatty acids were quantified by GC-FID and 25-hydroxyvitamin D and homocysteine by LC-MS/MS. Nutritional risk defined as population nutrient biomarker tertiles with NRI calculated as the number of nutrient biomarkers meeting a sub-optimum criterion with scores ranging from 0 to 3. Global and domain specific cognitive z-scores were fit with multivariate linear regression models and NRI as the primary exposure of interest. Mean age was 85.8 (7.6) years, MMSE was 27.8 (2.8) and 70% were female. Sixty-five % met criteria for ‘nutritional risk’ (NRI ³ 1: 193/293). Participants with optimum nutritional status exhibited superior global cognitive performance (NRI-0: mean global z-score ± SE = 0.10 ± 0.097) while each addition NRI point score associated with an incremental decrease in cognitive performance (NRI-1: 0.02 ± 0.09; NRI-2: −0.23 ± 0.13; NRI-3: −0.53 ± 0.19, P for trend = 0.002). Significant and similar trends were seen in specific cognitive domains, including attention (NRI-0: mean z-score ± SE = 0.20 ± 0.11; NRI-1: 0.02 ± 0.10; NRI-2: −0.32 ± 0.13; NRI-3: −0.38 ± 0.19, P for trend < 0.001) and executive function (NRI-0: mean z-score ± SE = 0.15 ± 0.10; NRI-1: −0.09 ± 0.10; NRI-2: −0.15 ± 0.13; NRI-3: −0.55 ± 0.20, P for trend = 0.002). The Nutritional Risk Index representing plasma n-3 PUFA, 25-OH-D and HCy explains significant variance in the cognitive performance of older adults, particularly attention and executive skills. These results in exceptionally healthy older adults suggest that cognitive performance is superior in those with plasma EPA + DHA wt% ≥ 2.53, 25-OH-D ≥ 25 ng/ml, and HCy < 11.57 umol/L.

Several reports show the importance of STB on grain yield, their components and grain protein while little is known about its effect on the rheological properties of the wheat flour. The scarce literature found, only mentions the effect of the complex of foliar diseases on wheat quality, without individualizing the effect of the different pathogens separately. This study analyze the influence of increasing doses of inoculum of Zymoseptoria tritici, on the bread making quality of ten Argentinean wheat cultivars and its possible variation according to their quality group. The increase of inoculum concentration augmented the area under disease progress curve, decreased green flag leaf area duration and green leaf area duration. Cultivars K. Flecha and B.75 Aniversario had the lowest green flag leaf area duration causing higher reduction in grain filling period and higher reductions in P, indicating a lower gliadin/glutenin ratio. STB decreased P/L and E while L, W, D, SV and bread volume increased. Cultivars differed in rheological parameters according to their quality group. Gluten/protein relationship was significant in quality group 1 and non-significant in cultivars belonging to quality group 2 and 3.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMycosphaerella graminicola 3abreadmaking quality 3abreads 3acultivars 3adisease course 3afilling period 3afoliar diseases 3agliadin 3agluten 3aglutenins 3agrain protein 3agrain yield 3ainoculum 3aleaf area 3apathogens 3arheological properties 3awheat 3awheat flour 0aWheat 0aSeptoria tritici blotch 0aBread making quality 0aRheological properties 0aSTB 0aGY 0aGPC 0aGS 0aG1 0aG2 0aG3 0aAUDPC 0aGLAD 0aGFLAD 0aBV 0aBW 0aSV 0aNI 0aLIC 0aHIC1 aSimón, María Rosa0 tJournal of cereal science.g2017 Sept., v. 77 p.259-265dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46803x0733-52107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcs.2017.08.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02544naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245010000173300001600273520134400289592002801633650002601661650001301687650000901700650002001709650001101729650001501740650001501755653003301770653002601803653002201829653001901851653002001870653002701890700006001917773008801977856008402065852000902149655001202158IND60600454320221121195058.0180703e20140501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060045432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2014.03.0842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBabaelahi, Mojtaba10aSimple-II: A new numerical thermal model for predicting thermal performance of Stirling engines  ap. 873-890.  aA new thermal model called Simple-II was presented based on modification of the original Simple analysis. First, the engine was modeled considering adiabatic expansion and compression spaces, in which effect of gas leakage from cylinder to buffer space and shuttle effect of displacer were implemented in the basic differential equations. Moreover, non-ideal thermal operation of the regenerator and the longitudinal heat conduction between heater and cooler through the regenerator wall were considered. Based on the magnitudes of pressure drops in heat exchangers, values of pressure in the expansion and compression spaces were corrected. Furthermore, based on the theory of finite speed thermodynamics (FST), the corresponding power loss due to the piston motion and also the mechanical friction were considered. Simple-II was employed for thermal simulation of a prototype Stirling engine. Finally, result of the new model was evaluated by comprehensive comparison of experimental results with those of the previous models. The output power and thermal efficiency were predicted with +20.7% and +7.1% errors, respectively. Also, the regenerator was demonstrated to be the main source of power and heat losses; nevertheless, other loss mechanisms have reasonable effects on output power and/or thermal efficiency of Stirling engines.  aPublisher supplied data 3adifferential equation 3afriction 3aheat 3aheat exchangers 3amodels 3aprediction 3aprototypes 0aHeat and mass leakage losses 0aHeat exchanger losses 0aFinite speed loss 0aShuttle effect 0aStirling engine 0aSimple-II thermal mode1 aSayyaadi, Hoseyn1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1368-14260 tEnergy.g2014 May 01, v. 69 p.873-890dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2014.03.0843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02718naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245009800167300001800265520133600283592002801619650002101647650001601668650001801684650001701702650001101719650001801730650001901748650001301767650002201780650001701802650001601819653001501835653001701850653001601867653001801883653001801901700001801919700001801937700001501955700001701970700001301987700001602000773012802016856008302144852000902227655001202236IND60704862120221119163711.0211219s2020    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070486212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.csbj.2020.07.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Ling-Yan10aNovel zwitterionic vectors: Multi-functional delivery systems for therapeutic genes and drugs  ap. 1980-1999.  aZwitterions consist of equal molar cationic and anionic moieties and thus exhibit overall electroneutrality. Zwitterionic materials include phosphorylcholine, sulfobetaine, carboxybetaine, zwitterionic amino acids/peptides, and other mix-charged zwitterions that could form dense and stable hydration shells through the strong ion–dipole interaction among water molecules and zwitterions. As a result of their remarkable hydration capability and low interfacial energy, zwitterionic materials have become ideal choices for designing therapeutic vectors to prevent undesired biosorption especially nonspecific biomacromolecules during circulation, which was termed antifouling capability. And along with their great biocompatibility, low cytotoxicity, negligible immunogenicity, systematic stability and long circulation time, zwitterionic materials have been widely utilized for the delivery of drugs and therapeutic genes. In this review, we first summarized the possible antifouling mechanism of zwitterions briefly, and separately introduced the features and advantages of each type of zwitterionic materials. Then we highlighted their applications in stimuli-responsive “intelligent” drug delivery systems as well as tumor-targeting carriers and stressed the multifunctional role they played in therapeutic gene delivery.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiocompatibility 3abiosorption 3abiotechnology 3acytotoxicity 3aenergy 3agene transfer 3aimmunogenicity 3apeptides 3aphosphorylcholine 3asulfobetaine 3azwitterions 0aZwitterion 0aBiomaterials 0aAntifouling 0aGene delivery 0aDrug delivery1 aZhu, Yang-Hui1 aWang, Xiao-Yu1 aShen, Chao1 aWei, Xia-Wei1 aXu, Ting1 aHe, Zhi-Yao0 tComputational and Structural Biotechnology Journal.g2020, v. 18 p.1980-1999dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23199x2001-03707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.csbj.2020.07.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02994naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002700150245011400177520144800291592002801739650001401767650001101781650001201792650002301804650001501827650001601842650002401858650001901882650001201901653002301913653002101936700002601957700002601983700002702009700002602036700002602062700003702088700003402125700003502159700003302194700003102227700006402258773010802322856008502430852000902515655001202524IND60673039320221118230413.0200503e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067303932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetpar.2019.1089242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFerraz, Carolina Magri10aCombined use of ivermectin, dimethyl sulfoxide, mineral oil and nematophagous fungi to control Rhabditis spp.  aRhabditis spp., is a nematode known to cause otitis externa, an infection difficult to control, in cattle reared within tropical regions. The objective of this study was to assess the combined use of ivermectin 1%, dimethyl sulfoxide 1% and mineral oil 100% containing nematophagous fungi of both Duddingtonia flagrans (AC001) and Monacrosporium thaumasium (NF34) species to control in vitro Rhabditis spp. Thus, 12 experimental groups were designed with eight replicates each: G1 (nematodes + AC001); G2 (nematodes + NF34); G3 (nematodes + ivermectin 1%/positive control); G4 (nematodes + dimethyl sulfoxide 1%/positive control); G5 (nematodes + mineral oil 100%/positive control); G6 (nematodes + AC001 + ivermectin 1%); G7 (nematodes + NF34 + ivermectin 1%); G8 (nematodes + AC001 + mineral oil 100%); G9 (nematodes + NF34 + mineral oil 100%); G10 (nematodes + AC001 + dimethyl sulfoxide 1%); G11 (nematode + NF34 + dimethyl sulfoxide 1%); G12 (nematode + distilled water/negative control). The results demonstrated that all experimentally treated groups differed statistically (p < 0.01) from the control group. In the present study, the use of dimethyl sulfoxide 1% and mineral oil 100% in conjunction with conidia fungi portrayed noteworthy outcomes, which represents a future premise for the combined use of nematophagous fungi within these vehicles in both controlling Rhabditis spp.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRhabditis 3acattle 3aconidia 3adimethyl sulfoxide 3aivermectin 3amineral oil 3anematophagous fungi 3aotitis externa 3atropics 0aBiological control 0aParasitic otitis1 aSobral, Samilla Alves1 aSenna, Caio Colodette1 aJunior, Otavio Fidelis1 aMoreira, Tiago Facury1 aTobias, Fernando Luiz1 ade Freitas Soares, Filippe Elias1 aGeniêr, Hugo Leonardo André1 aVilela, Vinicius Longo Ribeiro1 aLima, José Antônio Correia1 ade Araújo, Jackson Victor1 aBraga, Fabio Ribeiro1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2942-57850 tVeterinary parasitology.g2019 Nov., v. 275 p.108924-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl11815x0304-40177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetpar.2019.1089243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02757naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002200145245012300167300001800290520152100308592002801829650002501857650002401882650001701906650002501923650002001948650001801968650000901986650001301995650001402008650001502022650001102037700001902048700001602067700002402083700002102107773014302128856007902271852000902350655001202359IND60699984020221117043012.0200624s2020    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069998402DNAL7 a10.1139/cjfas-2019-03502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRosenfeld, Jordan10aAdaptive trade-offs in fish energetics and physiology: insights from adaptive differentiation among juvenile salmonids  ap. 1243-1255.  aJuveniles of different salmonid species often co-exist along environmental gradients, making them a useful model for identifying dominant trade-off axes and their stability within a biological hierarchy (e.g., from individuals to populations to species). In this perspective, we use multivariate trade-offs among juvenile coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) as a case study to explore broader-scale patterns of trait association. Multivariate ordination identified a dominant trade-off axis between high growth, consumption, and growth efficiency versus high aerobic scope and active metabolism among individual juvenile rainbow trout and three ecologically divergent rainbow trout populations. This pattern suggests a dominant trade-off between growth and active metabolism among individuals and populations, facilitated by simple developmental controls on increased energy intake (larger digestive tract, potentially more risky foraging behavior). In contrast, the adaptive trade-off differentiating species appears to have shifted to maximizing growth and consumption (rainbow trout) versus maximizing growth efficiency (coho), based on evolved differences in foraging strategy and digestive physiology. The generality of these patterns remains uncertain, but trade-offs related to growth efficiency may be an underappreciated dimension of adaptive differentiation in fishes, and their relationship to digestive strategy and active metabolism warrants further investigation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOncorhynchus kisutch 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3acase studies 3adigestive physiology 3adigestive tract 3aenergy intake 3afish 3aforaging 3ajuveniles 3ametabolism 3amodels1 aRichards, Jeff1 aAllen, Dave1 aVan Leeuwen, Travis1 aMonnet, Gauthier0 tCanadian journal of fisheries and aquatic sciences.g2020, v. 77, no. 7 p.1243-1255dNRC Research PresswJournal:jnl32083x1205-75337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-2019-03503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03719naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245016400169300001600333520187500349592002802224650002302252650002702275650001502302650001202317650002802329650001602357650002302373650001302396650001202409650001602421650002702437650002702464650002602491650001702517650002302534650001102557650001002568651002502578653002302603653002802626653001302654653002302667653002602690653002202716700001702738700002302755700001702778700002302795700005502818700005902873773011602932856008403048852000903132655001203141IND60591885620221118163852.0201202e20180430xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059188562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agwat.2018.03.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAl Yamani, Wafa10aWater use of Al Ghaf (Prosopis cineraria) and Al Sidr (Ziziphus spina-christi) forests irrigated with saline groundwater in the hyper-arid deserts of Abu Dhabi  ap. 105-114.  aThe arid forests of Abu Dhabi provide a variety of valuable provisioning, regulating and cultural ecosystem services. They require irrigating. And groundwater is the source. About 95 % of groundwater consumption is for agriculture and forestry. Over-extraction threatens groundwater resources. The Government of Abu Dhabi recently passed Law 5 to restrict groundwater abstraction. We have determined the minimum allocation required for the irrigation of two tree species. We carried out experiments at Madinat Zayed in the western desert on two arid-forest species: Al Ghaf (Prosopis cineraria) and Al Sidr (Ziziphus spina-christi), both planted on a 7 m × 7 m grid. We measured the actual evapotranspiration (ETc) using heat-pulse equipment in the trees. Saline groundwater with an electrical conductivity of about 8–10 dS m⁻¹ was used for irrigation. Current practice is to drip irrigate with 60 L d‐¹. Both species displayed distinct, and different, summer ‘deciduous behaviours’ that determine their seasonal pattern of ETc. A single crop-factor approach, using ETc predicted from Kc.ETo, where Kc is the crop factor and ETo is the reference evaporation, would not provide appropriate irrigation allocations. From our hourly measurements of ETc, made over 3 years, we quantified the seasonal pattern in Kc. For Al Ghaf, Kc ranged from 0.1 during February–July, to 0.15 in November–December; for the Sidr, Kc was at a minimum of 0.06 in May, and rose to 0.16 in December. Daily irrigation requirements were provided for Law 5. With a 25% factor-of-safety, and a 25% salt-leaching requirement, irrigation requirements for Al Ghaf ranged from 24.4 L d⁻¹ in January to 52.8 L d⁻¹ in July. For Al Sidr the range was from 33.8 L d⁻¹ in April to 53.5 L d⁻¹ in September. These are a 40% saving on current practice.  aPublisher supplied data 3aProsopis cineraria 3aZiziphus spina-christi 3aarid zones 3adeserts 3aelectrical conductivity 3aevaporation 3aevapotranspiration 3aforestry 3aforests 3agroundwater 3agroundwater extraction 3airrigation requirement 3airrigation scheduling 3asaline water 3aseasonal variation 3asummer 3atrees 3aUnited Arab Emirates 0aHyper-arid forests 0aSaline-water irrigation 0aSap flow 0aEvapotranspiration 0aIrrigation regulation 0aAllocation limits1 aGreen, Steve1 aPangilinan, Rommel1 aDixon, Steve1 aShahid, Shabbir A.1 aKemp, Peter1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2239-20121 aClothier, Brent1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1901-03240 tAgricultural water management.g2018 Apr. 30, v. 203 p.105-114dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8460x0378-37747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2018.03.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01660naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245003800168300001400206520056700220592002800787650001400815650002200829650002300851650002300874650001500897650001000912650002200922650001700944653001300961653001700974653001300991653002601004700002501030700001801055773010701073856008501180852000901265655001201274IND60623220120221120164819.0181222e20190103xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062322012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2018.11.0552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTan, Mario A.10aTotal synthesis of diaportheone A  ap. 52-54.  aDiaportheone A (1), a chromone natural product was previously isolated from the endophytic fungi Diaporthe sp.

We investigated if associations between diet quality (DQ), socioemotional development (SED), and academic performance (AP) varied by child weight status in U.S. 5ᵗʰ graders. Nationally representative data from 7755 U.S. children (mean age 11–11.5 years) were analyzed using survey-weighted, multiple linear regression models adjusted for relevant factors. DQ was calculated by applying a novel short Diet Quality Index (sDQI) on a brief food frequency questionnaire. Established measures for SED (Self-Description Questionnaire scaled scores for internalizing and externalizing problem behaviors [IPB, EPB] and peer relations competency) and AP (standardized reading, math, and science test scores) served as dependent variables. Children's weight status was classified based on their BMI compared against sex-age-specific BMI percentiles of CDC Child Growth Charts. Some relations between DQ and SED and AP were slightly moderated by child weight status. A borderline significant interaction between DQ and IPB (overall F = 2.48; P = 0.06) revealed better socioemotional health with higher diet quality for both underweight (β = −0.02 [SE = 0.01]; P < 0.01) and overweight children (β = −0.01 [SE = 0.00]; P = 0.01) that was not observed in children of normal weight (β = −0.00 [SE = 0.00]; P = 0.07) or obese (β = −0.01 [SE = 0.00]; P = 0.16) status. Another borderline significant interaction between DQ and math scores (overall F = 2.39; P = 0.07) highlighted higher scores with higher diet quality in underweight (β = 0.18 [SE = 0.07]; P = 0.01) and normal weight children (β = 0.10 [SE = 0.02]; P < 0.01) not observed in overweight (β = 0.00 [SE = 0.04]; P = 0.96) or obese (β = 0.02 [SE = 0.05]; P = 0.75) children. Significant interactions were not observed between DQ and EPB or peer relation competency, or DQ and reading or science scores, by child weight status. The moderating effects of child weight status here underscore a need for more research on the stress of malnutrition (non-normal weight status) in child development. Interventions to improve cognitive health through diet should heed underlying vulnerabilities within population groups to optimize success. n/a.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacademic achievement 3abehavior problems 3abody mass index 3achild development 3achild growth 3achildhood obesity 3acognition 3acognitive development 3afood frequency questionnaires 3agrowth curves 3amalnutrition 3anutritional adequacy 3anutritional status 3areading 3aregression analysis 3arisk factors 3aschool children 3aunderweight 3aUnited States1 aWang, Youfa1 aRiley, Anne1 aHurley, Kristen0 tCurrent developments in nutrition.g2019 June 13, v. 3, no.

However, no information on the suitability of this new test on whole grain flours is available. In this contest a multivariate approach was used to assess the GlutoPeak test ability to predict dough quality directly from whole grain flour. GlutoPeak test was performed on both refined and whole grain flours (22 samples), obtaining both profiles and calculated indices, which were subjected to data exploration through Principal Component Analysis. Results suggested a trend according to farinographic stability values. Furthermore, k-Nearest Neighbours classification models were developed using the GlutoPeak profiles to predict farinographic stability, leading to average prediction ability of 81.8% for both refined and whole grain flour data. The present outcome suggests the possibility of predicting farinographic stability by GlutoPeak test directly on whole grain flour, thus skipping the refinement process.  aPublisher supplied data 3adough quality 3agluten 3amodels 3aprediction 3aprincipal component analysis 3awheat 3awheat flour 3awhole grain flour 0aGlutoPeak test 0aFarinographic stability 0aWhole grain flour 0aPrincipal component Analysis 0aK-Nearest Neighbours classification 0aAgrEn 0aEnMT 0aEnPM 0aFS 0aGPU 0aMT 0aPCA 0aPMT1 aGrassi, S.q(Silvia),1 aOhm, Jae-Bom1 aAnderson, James1 aMarti, Alessandra0 tJournal of cereal science.g2018 Jan., v. 79 p.73-79dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46803x0733-52107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcs.2017.09.0053Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle01664naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245010600167300001400273520046200287592002800749650002400777650002300801650002300824650002300847650002800870650001300898650001400911653001000925653001700935653002400952653001500976653002100991700001901012700001401031700002001045773010701065856008501172852000901257655001201266IND60623220220221119003013.0181222e20190103xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062322022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2018.11.0582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYao, Yun-Xin10aRoom-temperature palladium-catalyzed direct 2-alkenylation of azole derivatives with alkenyl bromides  ap. 68-71.  aPd-catalyzed direct C2-alkenylation of azole derivatives proceeds efficiently under mild conditions, and the reaction of substituted benzoxazoles, oxazole and benzothiazole occurred even at room temperature.

Surface water resources in SA, and specifically in Gauteng, are under pressure from urbanisation, poor agricultural practices and untreated mining and industrial effluent. Research of these wetlands will benefit the development of health assessment tools for these unique aquatic resources. The aim of this project was to determine the water quality and macroinvertebrate community structure for each perennial pan during consecutive dry and wet seasons and to establish a possible comparison between these pans that can be used as a baseline for future research on pans. The sampled pans in Gauteng presented higher TDS, Cl and Mg results compared to other South African studies, and similar SO₄ results to pans in the Mpumalanga province. Ammonia, Al and Zn results of all pans through all sampling events exceed the Target Water Quality Range (TWQR) for aquatic ecosystems of the Water Quality Guidelines (WQG) from the Department of Water and Sanitation (DWS). The water quality from selected systems is suitable for livestock watering based on the DWS TWQR. Macroinvertebrate species of all sampled pans were mostly low water quality tolerant species with a predator dominant community structure. Seasonal variation of species was evident. Macroinvertebrate families found in the wet season include Hydrophilidae, Aeshnidae, Pleiidae, Ephemeroptera, Belostomatidae and Notonectidae. Families found in the dry season include Planaridae, Dysticidae, Hirudinidae and Daphnidae. Graphical representation of ordination analyses with Canoco version 5 (Ter Braak and Šmilauer 2012) indicated that TDS, temperature, pH, sulphates and hardness are strong drivers of the existing macroinvertebrate community in most of the pans.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAeshnidae 3aBelostomatidae 3aEphemeroptera 3aHydrophilidae 3aNotonectidae 3aaluminum 3aammonia 3aaquatic ecosystems 3aarid zones 3acommunity structure 3adry season 3aguidelines 3ahealth effects assessments 3aindustrial effluents 3alivestock 3amacroinvertebrates 3amagnesium 3amining 3apH 3asanitation 3aseasonal variation 3asulfates 3asurface water 3atemperature 3aurbanization 3awater hardness 3awater resources 3awet season 3awetlands 3azinc 3aAustralia 3aCentral Africa 3aSouth Africa 3aSouth America1 avan Vuren, J.

In a within-subjects design, 44 participants consumed high and low energy yoghurt drinks (255kcal and 57kcal per 200ml serving, respectively) first thing in the morning following 8h of fasting, every day for two weeks, with 5 exposures to each yoghurt drink on alternate days. The high and low energy yoghurt drinks were paired with two coloured labels (blue or pink), with the pairings fully counter-balanced. Every day of the third (test) week, participants were given a free choice of either consuming the pink or the blue labelled yoghurt drink. Participants chose the high energy drink significantly more often over the low energy drink, suggesting a conditioned preference for a delayed (energy) reward. These findings provide further evidence for energy based learning in human adults. This study also provides a new approach to the conditioning paradigm (cueing energy via a coloured label instead of flavour) and includes a new and important measure in this research area (preference instead of liking).  aPublisher supplied data 3aadult learning 3aadults 3abeverages 3aenergy 3aenergy content 3aflavor 3afood choices 3ayogurt1 aEl-Deredy, Wael0 tAppetite.g2011 Aug., v. 57, no. 1 p.45-49dElsevier Ltdx0195-66637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2011.03.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02319naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245007400170300001600244520118800260592002801448650002301476650002201499650002001521650001501541650001501556653000801571653000801579653002101587653001901608653002101627653002501648653001401673653002201687700001701709773011201726856008601838852000901924655001201933IND60673039720221118230118.0200419e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067303972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jeconom.2019.10.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aInoue, Atsushi14aThe uniform validity of impulse response inference in autoregressions  ap. 450-472.  aExisting proofs of the asymptotic validity of conventional methods of impulse response inference based on higher-order autoregressions are pointwise only. In this paper, we establish the uniform asymptotic validity of conventional asymptotic and bootstrap inference about individual impulse responses and vectors of impulse responses when the horizon is fixed with respect to the sample size. For inference about vectors of impulse responses based on Wald test statistics to be uniformly valid, lag-augmented autoregressions are required, whereas inference about individual impulse responses is uniformly valid under weak conditions even without lag augmentation. We introduce a new rank condition that ensures the uniform validity of inference on impulse responses and show that this condition holds under weak conditions. Simulations show that the highest finite-sample accuracy is achieved when bootstrapping the lag-augmented autoregression using the bias adjustments of Kilian (1999). The conventional bootstrap percentile interval for impulse responses based on this approach remains accurate even at long horizons. We provide a formal asymptotic justification for this result.  aPublisher supplied data 3aeconometric models 3aeconomic analysis 3aeconomic theory 3anew status 3astatistics 0aC22 0aC52 0aImpulse response 0aAutoregression 0aLag augmentation 0aAsymptotic normality 0aBootstrap 0aUniform inference1 aKilian, Lutz0 tJournal of econometrics.g2020 Apr., v. 215, no. 2 p.450-472dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11871x0304-40767nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jeconom.2019.10.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03212naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094024003900136024004600175040001800221100006000239245010200299300001600401506007600417506003100493520153100524592002802055596008302083506003702166650001302203650001602216650001802232650001202250650002102262650002202283650002002305650002902325650002002354650001102374650002502385653001702410653002502427653002502452653002802477700002502505773010502530856008602635852000902721655001202730IND60531194520221207135528.0190219e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053119452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2016.04.0112chorus7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2016.04.0112doi7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2016.04.0112chorusOpen  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLinhoss, Anna C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2692-565312aA comparison of five forest interception models using global sensitivity and uncertainty analysis  ap. 109-116.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aInterception by the forest canopy plays a critical role in the hydrologic cycle by removing a significant portion of incoming precipitation from the terrestrial component. While there are a number of existing physical models of forest interception, few studies have summarized or compared these models. The objective of this work is to use global sensitivity and uncertainty analysis to compare five mechanistic interception models including the Rutter, Rutter Sparse, Gash, Sparse Gash, and Liu models. Using parameter probability distribution functions of values from the literature, our results show that on average storm duration [Dur], gross precipitation [PG], canopy storage [S] and solar radiation [Rn] are the most important model parameters. On the other hand, empirical parameters used in calculating evaporation and drip (i.e. trunk evaporation as a proportion of evaporation from the saturated canopy [∊], the empirical drainage parameter [b], the drainage partitioning coefficient [pd], and the rate of water dripping from the canopy when canopy storage has been reached [Ds]) have relatively low levels of importance in interception modeling. As such, future modeling efforts should aim to decompose parameters that are the most influential in determining model outputs into easily measurable physical components. Because this study compares models, the choices regarding the parameter probability distribution functions are applied across models, which enables a more definitive ranking of model uncertainty.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000058250 fUnrestricted online access2star 3adrainage 3aevaporation 3aforest canopy 3aforests 3ahydrologic cycle 3amodel uncertainty 3aphysical models 3aprobability distribution 3asolar radiation 3astorms 3auncertainty analysis 0aInterception 0aSensitivity analysis 0aUncertainty analysis 0aCanopy storage capacity1 aSiegert, Courtney M.0 tJournal of hydrology.g2016 July, v. 538 p.109-116dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2016.04.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03450naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024003500132040001800167100001700185245010700202300001400309506007600323506003100399520121200430592002801642596008501670596007201755596009801827596004501925506003701970650001502007650001502022650002302037650001402060650002302074650002002097650001802117650001902135650001302154650002602167650002102193650002302214650002002237650000902257650001502266650001002281650001102291650001602302650002002318651001102338653002302349653001802372653001902390653002102409700005302430700001902483700001602502700001602518700001802534773012002552856008202672961001302754852000902767655001202776IND60584833820221207074728.0190405e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058483382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcs.2017.09.0022chorus7 a10.1016/j.jcs.2017.09.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPang, Bairen10aEvaluating effects of deficit irrigation strategies on grain sorghum attributes and biofuel production  ap. 13-20.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aWith reduced water resources available for agriculture, scientists and engineers have developed innovative technologies and management strategies aimed at increasing efficient use of irrigation water. The objective of this research was to study the impact of deficit irrigation strategies on sorghum grain attributes and bioethanol production. Grain sorghum was planted at Southwest Research-Extension Center near Garden City, KS, under five different irrigation capacities (1 inch every 4, 6, 8,10, or 12 days) and dryland in 2015 and 2016 growing seasons. Results showed average kernel weight, kernel diameter and test weight of grain sorghum increased as irrigation capacity increased, whereas kernel hardness index decreased as irrigation capacity increased. Starch and protein contents of sorghum ranged from 69.45 to 72.82% and 8.22–12.50%, respectively. Starch pasting temperature and peak time decreased as irrigation capacity increased. Irrigation capacity had a positive impact on bioethanol yield, whereas both year and interaction between irrigation capacity and year did not show significant effect on bioethanol yield resulting from above normal rainfall received during the growing seasons.  aPublisher supplied data  cFoundation for Food and Agriculture Researchdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100011929  cKansas Grain Sorghum Commissiondhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100006997  cKansas Water Resources Institute, Kansas State Universitydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100013658  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000001990 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aarid lands 3abioethanol 3adeficit irrigation 3aengineers 3aethanol production 3afuel production 3agrain sorghum 3agrowing season 3ahardness 3airrigation management 3airrigation water 3apasting properties 3aprotein content 3arain 3ascientists 3aseeds 3astarch 3atemperature 3awater resources 3aKansas 0aDeficit irrigation 0aGrain sorghum 0aStarch content 0aBioethanol yield1 aZhang, Ke1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8874-52821 aKisekka, Isaya1 aBean, Scott1 aZhang, Meng1 aWang, Donghai0 tJournal of cereal science.g2018 Jan., v. 79 p.13-20dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46803x0733-52107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcs.2017.09.0023Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle01608naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001900143245017100162300001800333520050900351592002800860650001400888650000900902650001200911650001400923650001300937653000800950653002300958653001900981700001301000700001801013773015301031856007701184852000901261655001201270IND60521481720221119114616.0160530e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052148172DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1976-12102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchmidbaur, H.10a35Cl-, 75As-NQR- und 197Au-Mößbauer-Untersuchungen an Gold(I)-chlorid-Komplexen / 35Cl-, 75As-NQR- and 197Au-Mössbauer Investigations of Gold(I)-chloride Complexes  ap. 1607-1610.  a³⁵Cl and ⁷⁵As NQR spectra have been recorded for six gold(I) chloride complexes with phosphine, arsine and sulfide ligands.

However, the S₀ formed in the DSR process are micro-sized colloids with negatively charged surface, making isolation of S₀ colloids from other biological cells and metabolites difficult. This study proposed the use of S₀ in DSR effluent as a novel adsorbent for zinc removal from wastewaters. Batch and continuous tests were conducted for efficient zinc removal with S₀-containing DSR effluent. At pH<7.5, removal rates of zinc(II) were increased with increasing pH. The formed S₀ colloids carried negative charge onto which zinc(II) ions could be adsorbed via electrostatic interactions. The zinc(II) adsorbed S₀ colloids further enhanced coagulation–sedimentation efficiency of suspended solids in DSR effluents. The DSR effluent presents a promising coagulant for zinc(II) containing wastewaters.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3acoagulants 3acolloids 3aeffluents 3aelectrostatic interactions 3agases 3aions 3anitrates 3aorganic sulfur compounds 3apH 3asulfides 3asulfur 3azinc 2aAdsorption 2aBiological Oxygen Demand Analysis 2aColloidsxchemistry 2aDenitrification 2aNitratesxchemistryxisolation & purification. 2aSpectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared 2aSpectrum Analysis 2aStatic Electricity 2aSulfidesxchemistryxisolation & purification. 2aSulfurxanalysisxchemistry. 2aWastewaterxchemistry. 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysis 2aWater Purificationxmethods 2aX-Ray Diffraction 2aZincxchemistry1 aZhou, Xu1 aWang, Aijie1 aWu, Dong-hai1 aLiu, Li-hong1 aRen, Nanqi1 aLee, D.

This type of wastewater is difficult to treat using conventional biological methods due to its low carbon‐to‐nitrogen ratio. Anaerobic ammonia oxidation (anammox) has become the first choice for treating rare earth mine wastewater. However, the effect of rare earth elements (REEs) in wastewater on anammox bacteria has been insufficiently studied, and this limits the application of this process. Yttrium is a rare earth element present in wastewater, and the study of its effect on anammox can help in the application of this process in rare earth mine wastewater. RESULTS: The effect of Y(III) on anammox granular sludge was studied using batch experiments. Anammox activity decreased with increasing Y(III) concentration, from 64.78 ± 0.28 to 17.15 ± 2.70 mg g⁻¹ VSS day⁻¹. The semi‐inhibitory concentration (IC₅₀) of Y(III) for anammox activity was 30.36 mg L⁻¹. Y (III) exhibited low promotion and high inhibition of anammox bacterial extracellular polymer secretion (EPS). Comparing the kinetic models, the Loung model is better suited for describing the kinetic equation of substrate concentration on anammox. CONCLUSION: The acute toxicity of Y(III) to anaerobic sludge is influenced by the substrate and Y (III) concentrations. EPS‐based defence strategies play an important role in counteracting the toxicity of Y(III). The Edwards model fits the experimental data well and is suitable for predicting the inhibition of anammox activity by the substrate concentration. © 2022 Society of Chemical Industry (SCI).  aPublisher supplied data 3aacute toxicity 3aammonia 3aammonium nitrogen 3aanaerobic ammonium oxidation 3abiotechnology 3acarbon nitrogen ratio 3adenitrification 3aequations 3amodels 3apolymers 3arare earth elements 3asecretion 3asludge 3awastewater 3ayttrium1 aYu, Ye1 aXiao, Chunqiao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9942-32351 aHu, Jinggang1 aLiu, Xuemei1 aDeng, Xiangyi1 aChi, Ruan0 tJournal of chemical technology and biotechnology.g2022 July, v. 97, no. 7 p.1833-1841dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.wJournal:jnl39259x0268-25757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jctb.70563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03097naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001600142245006800158300001600226500000900242520151700251592002801768650002701796650001501823650001101838650001601849650001901865650001501884650001601899650001701915650002001932650001201952650001401964650001501978650001501993650001302008650002302021650002202044650000902066650000902075650001702084650002402101650002402125650001002149650001702159650002102176650001502197700001202212700001502224700001402239773019202253856007702445852000902522655001202531IND60666399920221120171649.0191028e200501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066639992DNAL7 a10.2134/jeq2005.03362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, W. C.10aDegradation of N-Nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) in Landscape Soils  ap. 336-341.  aepub  aN-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), a potential carcinogen, was commonly found in treated wastewater as a by-product of chlorination. As treated water is increasingly used for landscape irrigation, there is an imperative need to understand the leaching risk for NDMA in landscape soils. In this study, adsorption and incubation experiments were conducted using landscape soils planted with turfgrass, ground cover, and trees. Adsorption of NDMA was negligibly weak (K d < 1) in all soils, indicating that NDMA has a high potential for moving with percolating water in these soils. Degradation of NDMA occurred at different rates among these soils. At 21°C, the half-life (t ₁/₂) of NDMA was 4.1 d for the ground cover soil, 5.6 d for the turfgrass soil, and 22.5 d for the tree soil. The persistence was substantially prolonged after autoclaving or when incubated at 10°C. The rate of degradation was not significantly affected by the initial NDMA concentration or addition of organic and inorganic nutrient sources. The relative persistence was inversely correlated with soil organic matter content, soil microbial biomass, and soil dehydrogenase activity, suggesting the importance of microorganisms in NDMA degradation in these soils. These results suggest that the behavior of NDMA depends closely on the vegetation cover in a landscape system, and prolonged persistence and increased leaching may be expected in soils with sparse vegetation due to low organic matter content and limited microbial activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aN-nitrosodimethylamine 3aadsorption 3aamines 3aautoclaving 3abiodegradation 3abyproducts 3acarcinogens 3achlorination 3aenzyme activity 3aenzymes 3ahalf life 3airrigation 3alandscapes 3aleaching 3amicrobial activity 3amicrobial biomass 3arisk 3asoil 3asoil enzymes 3asoil microorganisms 3asoil organic matter 3atrees 3aturf grasses 3avegetation cover 3awastewater1 aGan, J.1 aLiu, W.

However, despite encouraging clinical results of CAR-T cell therapy products, a significant proportion of patients do not achieve satisfactory responses, or relapse. In addition, CAR-T cell applications to solid tumors is still limited due to the tumor microenvironment and lack of specifically targetable tumor antigens. All current products on the market, as well as most investigational CAR-T cell therapies, are autologous, using the patient's own peripheral blood mononuclear cells as starting material to manufacture a patient-specific batch. Alternative cell sources are, therefore, under investigation (e.g. allogeneic cells from an at least partially human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched healthy donor, universal “third-party” cells from a non-HLA-matched donor, cord blood-derived cells, immortalized cell lines or cells differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells). However, genetic modifications of CAR-engineered cells, bioprocesses used to expand cells, and improved supply chains are still complex and costly. To overcome drawbacks associated with CAR-T technologies, novel CAR designs have been used to genetically engineer cells derived from alpha beta (αβ) T cells, other immune cells such as natural killer (NK) cells, gamma delta (γδ) T cells, macrophages or dendritic cells. This review endeavours to trigger ideas on the next generation of CAR-engineered cell therapies beyond CAR-T cells and, thus, will enable effective, safe and affordable therapies for clinical management of cancer. To achieve this, we present a multidisciplinary overview, addressing a wide range of critical aspects: CAR design, development and manufacturing technologies, pharmacological concepts and clinical applications of CAR-engineered cell therapies. Each of these fields employs a large number of ground-breaking scientific advances, where coordinated and complex process and product development occur at their interfaces.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHLA antigens 3abiotechnology 3aimmunotherapy 3amacrophages 3amarkets 3aneoplasms 3apatients 3aproduct development 3arelapse 0acancer immunotherapy 0aChimeric antigen receptor (CAR) 0aCAR-T cell therapy 0aAdvanced manufacturing technologies 0aNatural killer cells 0aCAR pharmacology 0aClinical trials 0aGenetic Engineering 0aCAR discovery and development1 aAbraham, E.q(Eytan),1 aKovar, Karin1 aFlaaten, Richard1 aMüller, Antonia M S0 tBiotechnology advances.g2022 Sept., v. 58 p.107917-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:6288x0734-97507nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biotechadv.2022.1079173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01788naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002000145245007200165300001600237500000900253520067900262592002800941650001800969650002500987650002501012650001301037650001201050650001801062700001501080700002001095700002901115773021701144856008001361852000901441655001201450IND60666400020221120062412.0191028e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066640002DNAL7 a10.2134/jeq2014.08.03342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrown, DelShawn10aPersistence of Pharmaceuticals in Effluent-Dominated Surface Waters  ap. 299-304.  aepub  aPharmaceutical fate in surface water depends on a combination of physical and chemical processes, but currently, little information is available on cumulative dissipation rates in effluent-dominated receiving waters.

The initial stage of deposit formation is crucial for adhesion and growth of deposit on refractories in the kiln. In this study, the simulated experiments of FeO formation indicated that the high FeO content decreased with increasing the roasting time. The effects of combustion efficiency of pulverized coal and Na2O amount on the adhesion on the refractory bricks were experimentally studied using an evaluated method. The results showed that the adhesion on the refractory bricks increased with decreasing the combustion efficiency of pulverized coal and increasing the Na2O content in the deposits. Finally, the mechanism of deposit formation mainly on the center-entrance area in the kiln was summarized as follows: the pulverized pellet powder and coal ash with unburnt carbon fell into the pores and cracks of the refractory bricks in the kiln. The unburnt carbon and alkali metal chemically reacted with the pellet powder and contributed to the formation of low-melting-point phases (fayalite, silicate), then the generated low melting point phases plus the chemical reactions between the deposits and refractory bricks caused the adhesion of deposits on the refractory bricks. The deposits grew and became thicker as the continuous effects of the above process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3abricks 3acarbon 3achemical reactions 3acoal 3acombustion efficiency 3aferrous oxide 3airon 3amelting point 3apellets 3aroasting 3asilicates 0aCoal combustion efficiency 0aRotary kiln 0aDeposit formation 0aUnburnt carbon 0aAlkali metal 0aLow-melting-phase1 aGuo, Yufeng1 aFan, Jianjun1 aHe, Yu1 aJiang, Tao1 aChen, Feng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1977-67951 aZheng, Fuqiang1 aYang, Lingzhi0 tFuel processing technology.g2018 June 15, v. 175 p.54-63dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12445x0378-38207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuproc.2018.03.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02763naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245016400167500001900331520125800350592002801608650002301636650001601659650001001675650001401685650001601699650002101715650001801736650001701754650003001771650001701801650001001818650001901828650002101847653001801868653001701886653001501903700002001918700001601938700001701954700001801971700002301989700001902012700002502031773012102056856008302177852000902260655001202269IND60704863020221119033034.0201124e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070486302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bcdf.2020.1002322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKilua, Aldrine10aWhole kidney bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) and bean hull reduce the total serum cholesterol, modulate the gut microbiota and affect the caecal fermentation in rats  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe consumption of non-digestible carbohydrates such as dietary fibre (DF) and resistant starch (RS) alleviates chronic disease development. Our present animal study was performed to assess the serum cholesterol level and caecal fermentation of red kidney bean (RKB)-fed-rats. RKB (Phaseolus vulgaris) variety is a DF- and RS-rich leguminous plant. Male Fischer 344 rats were assigned to one of these experimental diets; the control diet (CON) containing 10% cellulose, whereas whole bean (WB) and bean hull (BH) diets containing 6.5% cellulose and 3.5% kintoki DF in each diet for a period of 4wks. WB diet was considered as a source of DF and RS, while the BH diet as a source of DF. Both WB and BH diets potentially reduced the serum cholesterol level in rats. WB diet modulated the microbial composition depending on diet preferences. Besides, the increase in propionate production was attributed to RKB resistant starch. Therefore, the result of this study demonstrated that the DF in RKB had a substantial effect on the serum cholesterol level, whereas the RS in RKB had a substantial effect on gut microbiota and caecal fermentation, which possesses the ability to alleviate the chronic disease development and confer health benefits to the host.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhaseolus vulgaris 3ablood serum 3acecum 3acellulose 3acholesterol 3achronic diseases 3adietary fiber 3afermentation 3aintestinal microorganisms 3akidney beans 3amales 3apropionic acid 3aresistant starch 0aDietary fibre 0aKintoki bean 0aMicrobiota1 aChihiro, Hataya1 aHan, Kyu-Ho1 aHomma, Kaori1 aFukuma, Naoki1 aKamitani, Toshiaki1 aSuzuki, Toshio1 aFukushima, Michihiro0 tBioactive carbohydrates and dietary fibre.g2020 Oct., v. 24 p.100232-dElsevier LtdwJournal:21611x2212-61987nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bcdf.2020.1002323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02393naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100001700161245007900178300001300257500000900270520120900279592002801488650002001516650001801536650001601554650001201570650002101582650002201603650002201625650001501647650002501662650002001687650001401707650001801721650001801739773014501757856009601902852000901998655001202007IND60668597420221122234530.0191125e196701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066859742DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1967.03615995003100010008x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKijne, J.

The columns had been treated with two soil conditioners, Krilium and poly(vinyl alcohol). The soil-water diffusivities were calculated from the water content distribution data. Treatment of a clay loam with the soil conditioners caused 1.5-fold to 3-fold increases in soil-water diffusivity over the whole range of volumetric water contents. When expressed as a function of soil water potential, soil-water diffusivity increased by this treatment more than 10-fold at the lower soil-water potentials. The same treatment had far less effect on the soil-water diffusivity of a loamy sand. For both soils the rate of movement of the wetting front increased as a result of treatment with the soil conditioners. The calculated mean diffusivity and rate of movement of the wetting front in these soils was greater for n-heptane than for water. The intrinsic diffusivity and penetrability differed for the two permeants. Changes in viscosity, surface tension, and apparent contact angle did not account fully for this dependence of diffusivity and penetrability on the permeating liquid.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclay loam soils 3acontact angle 3adiffusivity 3aheptane 3aloamy sand soils 3apolyvinyl alcohol 3asoil conditioners 3asoil water 3asoil water potential 3asurface tension 3aviscosity 3awater content 3awetting front0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g1967 Jan., v. 31, no. 1 p.8-13dSoil Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44580x0361-59957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj1967.03615995003100010008x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02366naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245008000163300001400243520117000257592002801427650002201455650000901477650001501486650001101501650001301512650001001525650001201535650001101547650001401558653001901572653001501591653001501606653002201621700001401643700001801657700002101675700001501696700002101711773010601732856008501838852000901923655001201932IND60591886420221118164506.0190207e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059188642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fuproc.2018.03.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, Jun10aFast pyrolysis and combustion characteristic of three different brown coals  ap. 15-20.  aIn this study, brown coals fast pyrolysis/combustion was carried out in a moving furnace coupled with a balance, and the mass change of sample and emission of hydrocarbon components were online recorded. On the basis of the experimental results, the pyrolysis/combustion kinetic parameters were calculated. In the fast pyrolysis process, the apparent activation energy of Loy Yang brown coal, Wara brown coal and Usibelli brown coal was 36.9, 33.1 and 28.1 kJ/mol respectively, which was far lower than that obtained under the slow pyrolysis process. The main light hydrocarbon gases evolved from brow coal fast pyrolysis were CH4, C2H6 and C3H8. At the same time, it was found that the reaction rate of brown coal fast pyrolysis was strongly influenced by the oxygen content of the raw coal. The high oxygen content of the raw coal was beneficial to pyrolytic reaction. The combustion process of the brown coal could be divided two stages: in the first stage, the evolution and combustion of volatile matter occurred simultaneously. In the secondary stage, only char combustion occurred. The apparent activation energy of char combustion was 2.3–20.8 kJ/mol.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivation energy 3acoal 3acombustion 3aethane 3afurnaces 3agases 3amethane 3aoxygen 3apyrolysis 0aFast pyrolysis 0aCombustion 0aBrown coal 0aActivation energy1 aZhang, Li1 aKim, Hee Joon1 aKasadani, Yuichi1 aLi, Liuyun1 aShimizu, Tadaaki0 tFuel processing technology.g2018 July, v. 176 p.15-20dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12445x0378-38207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuproc.2018.03.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02573naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245012600168300001600294520135400310592002801664650001301692650001001705650001801715650001901733650003101752650001101783650001701794650002401811653002701835653002001862653002901882653003801911700002101949700001701970773010501987856008602092852000902178655001202187IND60531195020221118085301.0190318e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053119502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2016.04.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRobinson, G.10aExperimental saltwater intrusion in coastal aquifers using automated image analysis: Applications to homogeneous aquifers  ap. 304-313.  aThis paper presents the applications of a novel methodology to quantify saltwater intrusion parameters in laboratory-scale experiments. The methodology uses an automated image analysis procedure, minimising manual inputs and the subsequent systematic errors that can be introduced. This allowed the quantification of the width of the mixing zone which is difficult to measure in experimental methods that are based on visual observations. Glass beads of different grain sizes were tested for both steady-state and transient conditions. The transient results showed good correlation between experimental and numerical intrusion rates. The experimental intrusion rates revealed that the saltwater wedge reached a steady state condition sooner while receding than advancing. The hydrodynamics of the experimental mixing zone exhibited similar traits; a greater increase in the width of the mixing zone was observed in the receding saltwater wedge, which indicates faster fluid velocities and higher dispersion. The angle of intrusion analysis revealed the formation of a volume of diluted saltwater at the toe position when the saltwater wedge is prompted to recede. In addition, results of different physical repeats of the experiment produced an average coefficient of variation less than 0.18 of the measured toe length and width of the mixing zone.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3aglass 3ahydrodynamics 3aimage analysis 3alaboratory experimentation 3amixing 3asaline water 3asaltwater intrusion 0aSaline water intrusion 0aIntrusion angle 0aWidth of the mixing zone 0aLight to concentration conversion1 aAhmed, Ashraf A.1 aHamill, G.A.0 tJournal of hydrology.g2016 July, v. 538 p.304-313dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2016.04.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02925naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005500139245014700194300001800341500002000359520160100379592002801980596005902008650002202067650001802089650001402107650001502121650002002136650001402156650001302170650001102183650001302194650003302207700002102240700001402261700001802275773015102293856007402444852000902518655001202527IND60780160720221119104400.0220616e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078016072DNAL7 a10.1002/jctb.70552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Yongwei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5236-576010aSynthesis of hierarchical CoAPO‐5 catalysts in different fluoride medium and optimization of its catalytic oxidative desulfurization process  ap. 1822-1832.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: Fluoride ions can form corresponding complexes with transition metal elements (Co, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, etc.), so it is easier to synthesize heteroatomic molecular sieves in a fluorine‐containing system than in a fluorine‐free system. RESULTS: In this paper, a hierarchical CoAPO‐5 molecular sieve was synthesized in a fluorine system, and the effects of different fluorine resources on its synthesis were investigated. The CoAPO‐5 samples were characterized by X‐ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, N₂ adsorption–desorption and temperature‐programmed desorption of NH₃. CONCLUSION: The results showed that, compared with other fluorine resources, the sample D‐AFI‐1 synthesized with HF possessed more acid sites, which appeared to be more attractive for oxidative desulfurization. The central composite design of response surface methodology was applied to design experimental schemes employing D‐AFI‐1 as catalyst. The volume ratio of oxidant/fuel, extractant/fuel and the mass ratio catalyst/fuel were screened out as the significant factors after the investigation of single factors. The quadratic model of the three significant factors and desulfurization rate was established. On the basis of optimizing the reaction conditions, oxidant/fuel volumetric ratio, catalyst/fuel mass ratio and extractant/fuel were 0.07 mL mL⁻¹, 0.01 g g⁻¹ and 1.65 mL mL⁻¹, respectively, the desulfurization rate was 85.0%, which was consistent with the predicted value of the model (83.7%). © 2022 Society of Chemical Industry (SCI).  aPublisher supplied data  a21706017cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aX-ray diffraction 3abiotechnology 3acatalysts 3adesorption 3adesulfurization 3afluorides 3afluorine 3amodels 3aoxidants 3aresponse surface methodology1 aZhao, Xiangxiang1 aShao, Hui1 aYao, Jianfeng0 tJournal of chemical technology and biotechnology.g2022 July, v. 97, no. 7 p.1822-1832dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.wJournal:jnl39259x0268-25757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jctb.70553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03396naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001700146245013000163300001800293520163700311650002101948650002201969650000801991650002401999650001802023650001402041650001602055650002902071650003602100650002202136650001002158650001902168650001702187650001502204650003802219650002002257650002102277650002102298650002202319650001202341650002402353650001302377650003302390650001302423650001402436700001802450700001502468700001802483700001802501700001802519700001702537700002002554773017602574856004702750852000902797655001202806IND60580571020221121173122.0170922e20170802xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058057102DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.7b023812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Meng-Jun10aCloning, Expression, and the Effects of Processing on Sarcoplasmic-Calcium-Binding Protein: An Important Allergen in Mud Crab  ap. 6247-6257.  aShellfish allergy is a prevalent, long-lasting disorder usually persisting throughout life. However, the allergen information is incomprehensive in crab. This study aimed to identify a novel allergen in crab, show its potential in diagnosis and reduce the allergenicity by food processing. A 21-kDa protein was purified from Scylla paramamosain and confirmed as sarcoplasmic calcium binding protein (SCP) by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight/time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/TOF-MS). Total RNA was isolated from crab muscle, and a rapid amplification of cDNA was performed to obtain an ORF of 579 bp that coded for 193 amino acid residues. According to the results of circular dichroism analysis and ELISA assay, the recombinant SCP (rSCP) expressed in Escherichia coli showed similar physicochemical and immunoreactive properties to native SCP (nSCP). Additionally, the extensive cross reactivity of SCP among different species and the bidirectional IgE cross-reactivity between nSCP and rSCP were detected by iELISA. The allergenicity of rSCP was reduced via Maillard reaction or enzymatic cross-linking reaction, which was confirmed by the results of scanning electron microscopy, dot blot, and digestion assay. A straightforward and reproducible way was developed to obtain high yields of rSCP that maintains structural integrity and full IgE reactivity, which could compensate the low specific IgE-titers of most patient sera for future diagnosis. Furthermore, the Maillard reaction and enzymatic cross-linking reaction were effective approaches for the production of hypoallergenic seafood. 3aEscherichia coli 3aMaillard reaction 3aRNA 3aScylla paramamosain 3aallergenicity 3aallergens 3aamino acids 3acalcium-binding proteins 3acircular dichroism spectroscopy 3acomplementary DNA 3acrabs 3across reaction 3acrosslinking 3adesorption 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3afood processing 3ahypersensitivity 3aimmunoglobulin E 3amass spectrometry 3amuscles 3aopen reading frames 3apatients 3ascanning electron microscopy 3aseafoods 3ashellfish1 aLiu, Guang-Yu1 aYang, Yang1 aPan, Tzu-Ming1 aLiu, Yi-Xiang1 aSun, Le-Chang1 aCao, Min-Jie1 aLiu, Guang-Ming0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2017 Aug. 2, v. 65, no. 30 p.6247-6257dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals DivisionwJournal:12177x0021-85617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.7b02381  aDNAL 7aarticle02177naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245016100127300001600288500001500304520119300319650001801512650001301530650001201543650001301555650002001568653001701588653002101605700001901626700001801645700001701663700001701680773007701697852000901774939003301783946001101816655001201827IND9203208920221121135208.0920519e19910918xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920320892DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSuganuma, T.10aDetermination of kinetic parameters for maltotriose and higher malto-oligosaccharides in the reactions catalyzed by alpha-D-glucan phosphorylase from potato  ap. 213-220.  a2019-12-05  aFor kinetic studies on its synthetic and phosphorolytic reactions, alpha-D-glucan phosphorylase from potatoes was purified chromatographically until free of D-enzyme. Purified maltotriose (G3) is a poor primer in the phosphorylase-catalyzed synthetic reaction, showing an anomalous time course and making previous attempts to determine its kinetic parameters unsuccessful. In the present work the true rate of the G3-primed reaction was obtained from linear plots obtained by incorporating a sufficient quantity of beta-amylase in the digest to eliminate the more rapidly reacting G4 formed from the G3.A Km value of 9.4 +/- 0.8 mM for G3 was calculated from the data by a nonlinear least-squares method. Kinetic parameters for a series of higher malto-oligosaccharides (G4-G8) were also determined in both the synthetic and the phosphorolytic directions. A large change in the values of Km and V/e was seen on going from G3 to G4 for the synthetic reaction, and from G4 to G5 for the phosphorolytic. For the higher saccharides the V/e values do not vary strongly with increasing d.p., while the Km values tend to decrease, as has been seen in the reactions of other plant phosphorylases. 3aphosphorylase 3apotatoes 3amaltose 3akinetics 3aenzyme activity 0apurification 0aoligosaccharides1 aKitazono, J.I.1 aYoshinaga, K.1 aFujimoto, S.1 aNagahama, T.0 tCarbohydrate research.g1991 Sept. 18, v. 217 p.213-220x0008-62157nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02993naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024004200110040001800152100001800170245008400188300001800272520109200290650002701382650002501409650001701434650001301451650001301464650001101477650002101488650001101509650001401520650000701534650001201541650001401553650002601567650002001593650001601613650003301629650001201662650002701674650001101701650003701712650003001749650004001779650002001819650003101839650002501870650002801895650002601923650002801949650003801977650003002015650001602045650001702061700001602078773009102094852000902185856009202194930003302286945001302319946001102332655001202343IND2196175820221121075433.0981226e199806  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219617582DNAL7 a97172962pmid7 a10.1046/j.1365-2672.1998.00452.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLincoln, R.A.10aCharacterization of the interaction of bovine plasmin with Streptococcus uberis  ap. 1104-1110.  aThe binding of plasmin to Streptococcus uberis strain 0140J was optimal in the pH range 5.0-5.5. Plasmin binding decreased exponentially with increasing NaCl concentration (0-0.8 mol l-1), reaching a minimum at NaCl concentrations exceeding 0.55 mol l-1. Neither K+, Mg2+ nor the metal chelator EDTA had any effect on the interaction. Plasmin binding was prevented, in a concentration-dependent manner, by the amino acids lysine, arginine and epsilon-aminocaproic acid. Bound plasmin was also eluted from the bacterial cell using the same amino acids. Bound plasmin was lost from the bacterium in a time- and temperature-dependent fashion, the rate of plasmin loss increased with increasing temperature over the range 4-55 degrees C, and the elution of plasmin from live and heat-killed bacteria was similar. Cell-bound plasmin was only partially inhibited by the physiological inhibitor alpha 2-antiplasmin whereas the serine protease inhibitor aprotinin, and the active site titrant p-nitrophenyl-p-guanidiniobenzoate, inhibited the activity of the cell-bound plasmin by more than 95%. 3aEDTA (chelating agent) 3aStreptococcus uberis 3aactive sites 3aarginine 3abacteria 3acattle 3achelating agents 3alysine 3amagnesium 3apH 3aplasmin 3apotassium 3aproteinase inhibitors 3asodium chloride 3atemperature 2aAminocaproatesxpharmacology 2aAnimals 2aArgininexpharmacology 2aCattle 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aEdetic Acidxpharmacology 2aFibrinolysinxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aHot Temperature 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aLysinexpharmacology 2aMagnesiumxpharmacology 2aOsmolar Concentration 2aPotassiumxpharmacology 2aProtease Inhibitorsxpharmacology 2aStreptococcusxmetabolism 2aTemperature 2aTime Factors1 aLeigh, J.A.0 tJournal of applied microbiology.g1998 June, v. 84, no. 6 p.1104-1110x1364-50727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2672.1998.00452.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a19990131b19990208c00000000  aINDdGK1  aNon-US 7aarticle02544naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092024002200120024001900142040001800161100002100179245012300200300001800323506007600341520122700417506003701644650001901681650001501700650002001715650001001735650001301745650001201758650001601770650002101786650002601807650002901833700002301862773008301885852000901968856007801977930003302055946001102088990002302099655001202122IND4412554720221207131503.0081114e200811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441255472DNAL7 a10.1093/nar/gkn6992doi7 aPMC25826302pmcid7 a189408682pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGatta, Raffaella10aNF-Y substitutes H2A-H2B on active cell-cycle promoters: recruitment of CoREST-KDM1 and fine-tuning of H3 methylations  ap. 6592-6607.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe CCAAT box is a frequent promoter element, as illustrated by bioinformatic analysis, and it is bound by NF-Y, a trimer with H2A-H2B-like subunits. We developed a MNase I-based ChIP protocol on homogeneous cell populations to study cell-cycle promoters at the single nucleosome level. We analyzed histone methylations and the association of enzymatic activities. Two novel results emerged: (i) H3-H4 are present on core promoters under active conditions, with the expected cohort of 'positive' modifications; H2A-H2B are removed and substituted by NF-Y. Through the use of a dominant negative mutant we show that NF-Y is important for H3K36me3 deposition and for elongation, not recruitment of Pol II; (ii) H3K4 methylations are highly dynamic and H3K4me1 is a crucial positive mark. Functional siRNA inactivation and treatment with Tranylcypromine determined that KDM1 (LSD1) plays a positive role in transcription, specifically of G2/M genes. It requires CoREST, which is recruited on active promoters through direct interactions with NF-Y. These data are the first in vivo indication of a crucial interplay between core histones and 'deviant' histone-fold such as NF-Y, leading to fine-tuning of histone methylations.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abioinformatics 3acell cycle 3aenzyme activity 3agenes 3ahistones 3amutants 3anucleosomes 3apromoter regions 3asmall interfering RNA 3atranscription (genetics)1 aMantovani, Roberto0 tNucleic acids research.g2008 Nov., v. 36, no. 20 p.6592-6607x0305-10487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkn6993Available from publisher's Web site  a20081114b20081206c00000000  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle03625naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092024002200134024001900156040001800175100001800193245007800211300001800289506007600307520186300383506003702246650002802283650003202311650002702343650001702370650001502387650002102402650002702423650001102450650001802461650002202479650001102501650002002512650002002532650001402552650001102566650003002577650002002607650001102627653001602638653002402654653000902678700002102687700001902708700001702727700001702744700001802761773011102779852000902890856009202899930003302991946001103024655001203035IND4435865920221207132546.0100423e201005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443586592DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1742-4658.2010.07641.x2doi7 aPMC29296612pmcid7 a204120622pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNotari, Luigi10aPigment epithelium-derived factor binds to cell-surface F₁-ATP synthase  ap. 2192-2205.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF), a potent blocker of angiogenesis in vivo, and of endothelial cell migration and tubule formation, binds with high affinity to an as yet unknown protein on the surfaces of endothelial cells. Given that protein fingerprinting suggested a match of a ~ 60 kDa PEDF-binding protein in bovine retina with Bos taurus F₁-ATP synthase β-subunit, and that F₁Fo-ATP synthase components have been identified recently as cell-surface receptors, we examined the direct binding of PEDF to F₁. Size-exclusion ultrafiltration assays showed that recombinant human PEDF formed a complex with recombinant yeast F₁. Real-time binding as determined by surface plasmon resonance demonstrated that yeast F₁ interacted specifically and reversibly with human PEDF. Kinetic evaluations revealed high binding affinity for PEDF, in agreement with PEDF affinities for endothelial cell surfaces. PEDF blocked interactions between F₁ and angiostatin, another antiangiogenic factor, suggesting overlapping PEDF-binding and angiostatin-binding sites on F₁. Surfaces of endothelial cells exhibited affinity for PEDF-binding proteins of ~ 60 kDa. Antibodies to F₁β-subunit specifically captured PEDF-binding components in endothelial plasma membranes. The extracellular ATP synthesis activity of endothelial cells was examined in the presence of PEDF. PEDF significantly reduced the amount of extracellular ATP produced by endothelial cells, in agreement with direct interactions between cell-surface ATP synthase and PEDF. In addition to demonstrating that PEDF binds to cell-surface F₁, these results show that PEDF is a ligand for endothelial cell-surface F₁Fo-ATP synthase. They suggest that PEDF-mediated inhibition of ATP synthase may form part of the biochemical mechanisms by which PEDF exerts its antiangiogenic activity.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aH+/K+-exchanging ATPase 3aH-transporting ATP synthase 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aangiogenesis 3aantibodies 3abinding capacity 3abiochemical mechanisms 3acattle 3acell movement 3aendothelial cells 3ahumans 3apeptide mapping 3aplasma membrane 3areceptors 3aretina 3asurface plasmon resonance 3aultrafiltration 3ayeasts 0aF₁-ATPase 0aF₁Fo-ATP synthase 0aPEDF1 aArakaki, Naokatu1 aMueller, David1 aMeier, Scott1 aAmaral, Juan1 aBecerra, S.P.0 tFEBS journal.g2010 May, v. 277, no. 9 p.2192-2205dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1742-464X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1742-4658.2010.07641.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20110802b20110902c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02788naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092024002200120024001900142040001800161100002200179245010200201300001800303506007600321520133100397506003701728650002101765650001201786650002401798650001101822650001301833650001201846650002601858650001901884700001901903700001801922700002301940700001801963700002101981700002802002700002002030700001902050773008302069852000902152856007802161930003302239946001102272990002302283655001202306IND4412554020221207122042.0081114e200811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441255402DNAL7 a10.1093/nar/gkn6872doi7 aPMC25826262pmcid7 a189271122pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSoifer, Harris S.12aA role for the Dicer helicase domain in the processing of thermodynamically unstable hairpin RNAs  ap. 6511-6522.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn humans a single species of the RNAseIII enzyme Dicer processes both microRNA precursors into miRNAs and long double-stranded RNAs into small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). An interesting but poorly understood domain of the mammalian Dicer protein is the N-terminal helicase-like domain that possesses a signature DExH motif. Cummins et al. created a human Dicer mutant cell line by inserting an AAV targeting cassette into the helicase domain of both Dicer alleles in HCT116 cells generating an in-frame 43-amino-acid insertion immediately adjacent to the DExH box. This insertion creates a Dicer mutant protein with defects in the processing of most, but not all, endogenous pre-miRNAs into mature miRNA. Using both biochemical and computational approaches, we provide evidence that the Dicer helicase mutant is sensitive to the thermodynamic properties of the stems in microRNAs and short-hairpin RNAs, with thermodynamically unstable stems resulting in poor processing and a reduction in the levels of functional mi/siRNAs. Paradoxically, this mutant exhibits enhanced processing efficiency and concomitant RNA interference when thermodynamically stable, long-hairpin RNAs are used. These results suggest an important function for the Dicer helicase domain in the processing of thermodynamically unstable hairpin structures.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aRNA interference 3aalleles 3adouble-stranded RNA 3ahumans 3amicroRNA 3amutants 3asmall interfering RNA 3athermodynamics1 aSano, Masayuki1 aSakurai, Kumi1 aChomchan, Pritsana1 aSætrom, Pål1 aSherman, Mark A.1 aCollingwood, Michael A.1 aBehlke, Mark A.1 aRossi, John J.0 tNucleic acids research.g2008 Nov., v. 36, no. 20 p.6511-6522x0305-10487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkn6873Available from publisher's Web site  a20081114b20081206c00000000  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle03201naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024004200110040001800152100001700170245006800187300001800255520153700273650002401810650001801834650002301852650002101875650002201896650001401918650003901932650001701971650001801988650002002006650001702026650001202043650003302055650002702088650001802115650004002133650002202173650002902195650009202224650002302316650001402339650002402353700001802377700001502395773009102410852000902501856009202510930003302602945001302635946001102648655001202659IND2196174920221121050054.0981226e199806  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219617492DNAL7 a97172852pmid7 a10.1046/j.1365-2672.1998.00437.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAtabay, H.I.10aDiversity and prevalence of Arcobacter spp. in broiler chickens  ap. 1007-1016.  aNinety-nine strains of Arcobacter spp., isolated from 10 chicken carcasses purchased from a supermarket and 15 chicken carcasses collected from a poultry abattoir, were speciated using a variety of phenotypic identification methods. All were tested using API Campy test strips and the 16-test (Preston) identification scheme developed for campylobacters. Fifty strains were selected for examination using a more comprehensive probabilistic identification scheme, and the identity of representative strains confirmed by protein profiling using SDS-PAGE. All 25 carcasses yielded Arcobacter butzleri. Three supermarket and 10 abattoir carcasses also carried A. cryaerophilus, and two abattoir carcasses carried A. skirrowii. The API Campy scheme proved unsatisfactory for identifying these strains: only 20 of 99 strains were accurately identified, all of which were A. cryaerophilus, the only Arcobacter sp. included in the database. Moreover, 76 of 99 strains were misidentified. The 16-test scheme identified all the arcobacter strains as A. cryaerophilus, since neither A. butzleri nor A. skirrowii had been described when the scheme was developed. The computer-assisted probabilistic scheme succeeded in identifying all but one strain, the identity of which was clarified by the use of SDS-PAGE. To our knowledge this is the first time that arcobacters other than A. butzleri have been reported in poultry meat or any other food of animal origin. Their high prevalence in poultry products may be of significance to public health. 3aArcobacter butzleri 3aCampylobacter 3aanimal-based foods 3abroiler chickens 3achicken carcasses 3adatabases 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3apoultry meat 3apublic health 3aslaughterhouses 3asupermarkets 2aAnimals 2aBacterial Proteinsxanalysis 2aChickensxmicrobiology 2aCulture Media 2aElectrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel 2aFood Microbiology 2aFood-Processing Industry 2aGram-Negative Bacteriaxclassificationxgrowth & developmentxisolation & purification. 2aMeatxmicrobiology 2aPhenotype 2aReference Standards1 aCorry, J.E.L.1 aOn, S.L.W.0 tJournal of applied microbiology.g1998 June, v. 84, no. 6 p.1007-1016x1364-50727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2672.1998.00437.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a19990301b19990308c00000000  aINDdGK1  aNon-US 7aarticle02630naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092024002200120024001900142040001800161100002200179245010600201300001800307506007600325520122700401506003701628650000801665650003201673650001701705650001801722650001901740650001401759650001201773650001901785700002201804700002501826700001601851700002301867700002101890700002401911773008301935852000902018856007802027930003302105946001102138990002302149655001202172IND4412555020221207123919.0081114e200811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441255502DNAL7 a10.1093/nar/gkn6322doi7 aPMC25826062pmcid7 a189408722pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPoranen, Minna M.10aStructural explanation for the role of Mn²⁺ in the activity of {phi}6 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase  ap. 6633-6644.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe biological role of manganese (Mn²⁺) has been a long-standing puzzle, since at low concentrations it activates several polymerases whilst at higher concentrations it inhibits. Viral RNA polymerases possess a common architecture, reminiscent of a closed right hand. The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of bacteriophage {phi}6 is one of the best understood examples of this important class of polymerases. We have probed the role of Mn²⁺ by biochemical, biophysical and structural analyses of the wild-type enzyme and of a mutant form with an altered Mn²⁺-binding site (E491 to Q). The E491Q mutant has much reduced affinity for Mn²⁺, reduced RNA binding and a compromised elongation rate. Loss of Mn²⁺ binding structurally stabilizes the enzyme. These data and a re-examination of the structures of other viral RNA polymerases clarify the role of manganese in the activation of polymerization: Mn²⁺ coordination of a catalytic aspartate is necessary to allow the active site to properly engage with the triphosphates of the incoming NTPs. The structural flexibility caused by Mn²⁺ is also important for the enzyme dynamics, explaining the requirement for manganese throughout RNA polymerization.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aRNA 3aRNA-directed RNA polymerase 3aactive sites 3aaspartic acid 3abacteriophages 3amanganese 3amutants 3apolymerization1 aSalgado, Paula S.1 aKoivunen, Minni R.L.1 aWright, Sam1 aBamford, Dennis H.1 aStuart, David I.1 aGrimes, Jonathan M.0 tNucleic acids research.g2008 Nov., v. 36, no. 20 p.6633-6644x0305-10487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkn6323Available from publisher's Web site  a20081114b20081206c00000000  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02863naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024004200110040001800152100001700170245018000187300001600367520112100383650002601504650002701530650002701557650000801584650001001592650000901602650001901611650001901630650001101649650001401660650002001674650000901694650001601703650001501719650001701734650004801751650002201799650002001821650001101841650004901852650002401901650002501925650004901950700002301999700001402022700001502036773008802051852000902139856009202148930003302240945001302273946001102286655001202297IND2195866620221121024021.0981207e199805  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219586662DNAL7 a96741452pmid7 a10.1046/j.1365-2672.1998.00424.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGeorge, S.M.10aEffect of oxygen concentration and redox potential on recovery of sublethally heat-damaged cells of Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella enteritidis and Listeria monocytogenes  ap. 903-909.  aThe measured heat resistance of cells of Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella enteritidis and Listeria monocytogenes was up to eightfold greater when they were grown, heated and recovered anaerobically rather than aerobically. Measured heat resistance was highest when anaerobic gas mixtures were used (time at 59 degrees C for a 6-decimal (6-D) reduction of E. coli O157:H7, 19-24 min); moderate when low concentrations of oxygen (0.5-1%) were included (time for a 6-D reduction, 5-17 min); and lowest when higher concentrations of oxygen (2-40%) were used (time for a 6-D reduction, 3 min). This effect was principally attributed to the recovery conditions, and a greater effect was noted at lower heating temperatures. The use of reduced oxygen concentration (< 2% O2), e.g. packing under an anaerobic gas mixture or a vacuum, might therefore increase the risk of these pathogens surviving heat treatments applied to food. It is also possible that foods that are packed in air but with a low redox potential might allow the survival of heated cells, and thus the anticipated level of safety might not be achieved. 3aEscherichia coli O157 3aListeria monocytogenes 3aSalmonella Enteritidis 3aair 3afoods 3aheat 3aheat tolerance 3aheat treatment 3aoxygen 3apathogens 3aredox potential 3arisk 3atemperature 2aAerobiosis 2aAnaerobiosis 2aEscherichia coli O157xgrowth & development 2aFood Microbiology 2aHot Temperature 2aHumans 2aListeria monocytogenesxgrowth & development 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aOxygenxpharmacology 2aSalmonella enteritidisxgrowth & development1 aRichardson, L.C.C.1 aPol, I.E.1 aPeck, M.W.0 tJournal of applied microbiology.g1998 May, v. 84, no. 5 p.903-909x1364-50727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2672.1998.00424.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a19990131b19990208c00000000  aINDdGK1  aNon-US 7aarticle03408naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245008500167300001800252520198300270650004302253650002502296650000902321650001802330650001602348650001002364650001602374650001102390650003002401650001002431650002002441650001502461650001202476650001402488650003002502650001402532650001402546651001802560700002202578700002202600700002202622700002502644700002402669773017302693856005102866852000902917655001202926IND60372971420221121023957.0150817e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6037297142DNAL7 a10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-13-5182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiao, Yen-Te10aNon-O157 Shiga ToxinâProducing Escherichia coli in U.

Retail Ground Beef  ap. 1188-1192.  aShiga toxinâproducing Escherichia coli (STEC) serotype O157:H7 and serogroups O26, O45, O103, O111, O121, and O145 are the leading cause of STEC-associated infections in humans in the United States. In the United States, these organisms are considered adulterants in raw nonintact beef products and in intact beef destined to be made into or used in nonintact raw beef products. The objective of this study was to provide an estimate of the burden of the six serogroups of non-O157 STEC in ground beef obtained from retail stores across the United States. A convenience sample of commercial ground beef products (n = 1,129) were purchased from retail stores in 24 states from October 2011 to May 2012. The samples had various lean/fat proportions, muscle group of origin (chuck, round, sirloin, or not specified), and packaging types. For each ground beef sample, 25 g was inoculated in 225 ml of modified tryptic soy broth, stomached for 1 min, and then incubated at 41Â°C for 18 Â± 2 h. These enrichment cultures were then screened for stx, eae, and O group genes using a commercially available, closed-platform PCR-based method. The potential positive samples were subjected to immunomagnetic separation and plated on modified Rainbow agar. Morphologically typical colonies were subjected to latex agglutination and PCR determination of stx and eae genes. Nine (0.8%) of the ground beef samples were potentially positive for at least one STEC serogroup after PCR screening. The serogroups detected by PCR assay were O26 (four samples), O103 (four samples), O145 (three samples), O45 (two samples), and O121 (one sample). No STEC isolates belonging to these serogroups were recovered from the sample cultures. The current research provides updated surveillance data for non-O157 STEC isolates among commercial ground beef products and information regarding the potential sources of contamination from different parts of beef trims destined for ground beef production. 3aShiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli 3aadulterated products 3aagar 3aagglutination 3abeef cattle 3agenes 3aground beef 3ahumans 3aimmunomagnetic separation 3alatex 3ameat production 3amonitoring 3amuscles 3apackaging 3apolymerase chain reaction 3ascreening 3aserotypes 3aUnited States1 aMiller, Markus F.1 aLoneragan, Guy H.1 aBrooks, J.

However, due to the limitations of current methods and techniques, not much is known about whether and how these proteins physically associate with the engaged polymerases. To gain insight into the detailed mechanisms involved, we established an experimental system for analyzing direct factor interactions to RNAP II elongation complexes on native gels, namely elongation complex electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EC-EMSA). This new assay effectively allowed detection of interactions of TFIIF, TTF2, TFIIS, DSIF and P-TEFb with elongation complexes generated from a natural promoter using an immobilized template. As an application of this assay system, we characterized the association of transcription elongation factor DSIF with RNAP II elongation complexes and discovered that the nascent transcript facilitated recruitment of DSIF. Examples of how the system can be manipulated to address different questions are provided. EC-EMSA should be useful for further investigation of factor interactions with RNAP II elongation complexes.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA-directed RNA polymerase 3agel electrophoresis 3agels 3anucleic acids 3aproteins1 aPrice, David H.0 tNucleic acids research.g2008 Nov., v. 36, no. 20 p.e135-e135x0305-10487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkn6303Available from publisher's Web site  a20081114b20081206c00000000  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02159naa a2200265 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092245005300110300001800163520146100181650001101642650002801653650001401681650001101695650001201706650001301718651001901731773007601750852000901826939003301835946001301868655001201881IND4373912220221121002932.0050901e200508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437391222DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL10aObesity Impacts on General Practice Appointments  ap. 1442-1449.  aOBJECTIVE: To quantify the impact of obesity on the number of visits to both primary and secondary care teams. RESEARCH METHODS AND PROCEDURES: The adult populations of 80 general practices throughout the United Kingdom were classified according to their BMI. We undertook a cross-sectional survey of computer-generated and handwritten records of 6150 obese people (BMI [>/=] 30 kg/m²) and 1150 normal weight (BMI = 18.5 to 24.9 kg/m²) control subjects over an 18-month retrospective period. RESULTS: Obese patients made significantly more visits to the general practitioner (GP), practice nurse (PN), and hospital outpatient units than normal weight patients (all p < 0.001), and they were admitted to the hospital more often (p = 0.034). For both GP and PN visits, the relationship remained after adjusting for age, sex, social deprivation category, country, and number of comorbidities. Among obese patients, there was an increasing relationship between frequent GP visits (at least four appointments) and greater BMI, which remained significant after adjustment had been made for age, sex, deprivation, country, and number of comorbidities. DISCUSSION: The human resource burden to general practice is significantly higher in the obese population than in the normal weight population, even when adjusted for confounding factors. The increase in prevalence of obesity will continue to put pressure on GP and PN time unless appropriate action is taken. 3aadults 3across-sectional studies 3ahospitals 3ahumans 3aobesity 3aresearch 3aUnited Kingdom0 tObesity research.g2005 Aug., v. 13, no. 8 p.1442-1449x1071-73237nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b00000000c20110315  aOther US 7aarticle02397naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001700152245016300169300001600332520126600348650002901614650001101643650001601654650000901670650001101679650002701690650001601717650002601733700001401759700001601773773008801789852000901877856009201886930003301978945001302011946001102024655001202035IND2195864020221121003058.0981207e199805  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219586402DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1365-2672.1998.00409.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCaudales, R.10aCellular fatty acid composition of rod and coccus forms of Arthrobacter globiformis, A. crystallopoietes and A. nicotianae isolated from the water fern Azolla  ap. 784-790.  aSeven strains of Arthrobacter globiformis, and one each of A. crystallopoietes and A. nicotianae, isolated from the water fern Azolla, were cultured for 2-3 at 30 degrees C on Pseudomonas Agar F to obtain rods and for 5 d to obtain cocci, then analysed for total cellular fatty acids.

Minor components included unsaturated branched chains, hydroxy and cyclopropane fatty acids. Fatty acid composition of A. globiformis was similar to that of A. crystallopoietes but different from that of A. nicotianae. Saturated straight chains in A. nicotianae averaged 1.5% of the total compared with 14-16% in A. globiformis/crystallopoietes, and anteiso-15:0 constituted 73% of the total in A. nicotianae compared with 18-19% in the other species. Composition of cocci was different from that of rods in A. globiformis and A. crystallopoietes. As cells changed from rods to cocci, percentages of saturated and unsaturated straight chains decreased and saturated iso- and anteiso-branched chains increased. In A. nicotianae there were no significant differences in the fatty acids between rods and cocci. 3aArthrobacter globiformis 3aAzolla 3aPseudomonas 3aagar 3acarbon 3afatty acid composition 3afatty acids 3aferns and fern allies1 aForni, C.1 aWells, J.M.0 tJournal of applied microbiology.g1998 May, v. 84, no. 5 p.784-790x1364-50727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2672.1998.00409.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a19990131b19990208c00000000  aINDdGK1  aNon-US 7aarticle03425naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245013900168300001800307520174800325650002402073650002502097650001302122650001702135650001302152650002202165650001002187650002102197650001802218650001602236650002202252650002002274650001402294650001402308650001002322650001102332650001502343650000902358650001302367650000902380650001902389650001402408650002402422650001002446650001302456650001302469651001202482700002002494700002102514700002002535700002102555700002602576773017302602856005102775852000902826655001202835IND60372972420221120221531.0150817e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6037297242DNAL7 a10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-13-5192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVo, Thuan Huu10aApplying Standard Epidemiological Methods for Investigating Foodborne Disease Outbreak in Resource-Poor Settings: Lessons from Vietnam  ap. 1229-1231.  aAn outbreak of gastroenteritis occurred among workers of company X after eating lunch prepared by a catering service. Of 430 workers attending the meal, 56 were hospitalized with abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting, and nausea, according to the initial report. We conducted an investigation to identify the extent, vehicle, and source of the outbreak. In our case-control study, a case was a worker who attended the meal and who was hospitalized with acute gastroenteritis; controls were randomly selected from non-ill workers. Cases and controls were interviewed using a standard questionnaire. We used logistic regression to calculate adjusted odds ratios for the consumption of food items. Catering service facilities and food handlers working for the service were inspected. Food samples from the catering service were tested at reference laboratories. Of hospitalized cases, 54 fulfilled the case definition, but no stool specimens were collected for laboratory testing. Of four food items served during lunch, only âsquash and pork soupâ was significantly associated with gastroenteritis, with an adjusted odds ratio of 9.5 (95 % CI 3.2, 27.7). The caterer did not separate cooked from raw foods but used the same counter for both. Cooked foods were kept at room temperature for about 4 h before serving. Four of 14 food handlers were not trained on basic food safety principles and did not have health certificates. Although no microbiological confirmation was obtained, our epidemiological investigation suggested that squash and pork soup caused the outbreak. Hospitals should be instructed to obtain stool specimens from patients with gastroenteritis. Food catering services should be educated in basic food safety measures. 3aambient temperature 3acase-control studies 3acatering 3acooked foods 3adiarrhea 3adisease outbreaks 3afeces 3afood consumption 3afood handling 3afood safety 3afoodborne illness 3agastroenteritis 3ahospitals 3aingestion 3alunch 3anausea 3aodds ratio 3apain 3apatients 3apork 3aquestionnaires 3araw foods 3aregression analysis 3asoups 3asquashes 3avomiting 3aVietnam1 aNguyen, Dat Van1 aLe, Loan Thi Kim1 aPhan, Lan Trong1 aNuroti, J.

Bacterial expression can be used to express small recombinant antibodies on a large scale; however, their overexpression often results in the formation of insoluble aggregates, and in most cases artificial affinity peptide tags need to be fused to the antibodies for purification by affinity chromatography. Here, we propose a novel method for preparing refined, functional, tag-free bi-specific diabodies from IgG-like bi-specific antibodies (BsAbs) in a mammalian expression system. We created an IgG-like BsAb in which bi-specific diabodies were fused to the human Fc region via a designed human rhinovirus 3C (HRV3C) protease recognition site. The BsAb was purified by protein A affinity chromatography, and the refined tag-free hEx3-Db was efficiently produced from the Fc fusion format by protease digestion. The tag-free hEx3-Db from the Fc fusion format showed a greater inhibition of cancer growth than affinity-tagged hEx3-Db prepared directly from Chinese hamster ovary cells. We also applied our novel method to another small recombinant antibody fragment, hEx3 single-chain diabody (hEx3-scDb), and demonstrated the versatility and advantages of our proposed method compared with papain digestion of hEx3-scDb. This approach may be used for industrial-scale production of functional tag-free small therapeutic antibodies. 3aChinese hamsters 3aHuman rhinovirus 3aaffinity chromatography 3aanimal ovaries 3aepidermal growth factor receptors 3ahumans 3aimmunotherapy 3apapain 3aprotein tagging 3arecombinant antibodies 0abi-specific diabody 0aFc fusion format 0apreparation method 0asmall therapeutic antibody 0atag-free protein1 aIkoma, Keiko1 aKawaguchi, Hiroko1 aIshiyama, Yuna1 aNakanishi, Takeshi1 aUmetsu, Mitsuo1 aHayashi, Hiroki1 aKatayose, Yu1 aUnno, Michiaki1 aKudo, Toshio1 aKumagai, Izumi0 tFEBS journal.g2010 Jan., v. 277, no. 2 p.477-487dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1742-464X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1742-4658.2009.07499.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100213b20100305c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01985naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125100002200143245005300165300001800218520080200236650000901038650001101047650001001058650001201068650001401080650001001094650001301104650001101117650001301128651001301141651001001154700001501164700002001179700001901199700002801218700002101246700001901267773012701286852000901413856008301422930003301505946001301538655001201551IND4412545520221120165518.0081114e20081114xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441254552DNAL7 a10.1126/science.11635922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSimpson, Scott W.12aA Female Homo erectus Pelvis from Gona, Ethiopia  ap. 1089-1092.  aAnalyses of the KNM-WT 15000 Homo erectus juvenile male partial skeleton from Kenya concluded that this species had a tall thin body shape due to specialized locomotor and climatic adaptations. Moreover, it was concluded that H. erectus pelves were obstetrically restricted to birthing a small-brained altricial neonate. Here we describe a nearly complete early Pleistocene adult female H. erectus pelvis from the Busidima Formation of Gona, Afar, Ethiopia. This obstetrically capacious pelvis demonstrates that pelvic shape in H. erectus was evolving in response to increasing fetal brain size. This pelvis indicates that neither adaptations to tropical environments nor endurance running were primary selective factors in determining pelvis morphology in H. erectus during the early Pleistocene. 3aHomo 3aadults 3abrain 3afemales 3ajuveniles 3amales 3aneonates 3apelvis 3askeleton 3aEthiopia 3aKenya1 aQuade, Jay1 aLevin, Naomi E.1 aButler, Robert1 aDupont-Nivet, Guillaume1 aEverett, Melanie1 aSemaw, Sileshi0 tScience.g2008 Nov. 14, v. 322, no. 5904 p.1089-1092dAmerican Association for the Advancement of Sciencex0036-80757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.11635923Available from publisher's Web site  a20081114b20081206c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03625naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144072001700161100001700178245011400195300001600309500001500325520219000340650001702530650002102547650001302568650001802581650001902599650001302618650001102631650002202642650002302664650000902687650001802696650002102714650001802735650002202753650001802775651001302793653002302806653002102829700002102850700001902871700002102890773010402911852000903015930003303024945002503057946001303082655001203095IND4390336320221120155138.0070413s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439033632DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Thus, we evaluated the variability of N2O emissions measured by microchambers (cross section: 184 cm2) from a groundnut-fallow-maize-fallow cropping system of the humid tropics. The crops received inorganic nitrogen (N) plus crop residues (NC), inorganic N alone as ammonium sulfate (RN), and half of the inorganic N along with crop residues and chicken manure (N(1/2)CM), amounting for the crop rotation to 322, 180, and 400 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively. The N2O fluxes during the groundnut-maize crop rotation were log-normally distributed, and the frequency distributions were positively skewed. Daytime changes in N2O fluxes were inconsistent, and the 50% of total N2O emission during the 12 h measurement periods was attained earlier under maize (approximately 11:00 h) than groundnut covers (approximately 13:00 h). Spatial variability in each treatment with eight gas chambers was large but smaller during the cropping periods than the fallow, indicating masking efficiency of crop covers for the soil heterogeneity that was accelerated presumably by antecedent climatic variables. The temporal variability of N2O emissions was also large (coefficients of variation, CV, ranged from 60 to 81%), involving both input differences between treatments and measurement periods. As such, the relative deviation from the annual mean of total N2O emission was high during the period after a large N application with a maximum of +480%, due to addition of chicken manure. The seasonal contribution of summer and monsoon to N2O emissions was insignificant. However, intensive rainfall negatively (-0.65**) and the amount of added N from either source positively (0.83***) correlated with the integrated N2O emissions, and those were exponential. Results suggest that around noon (12:00 h) gas collection could represent well the daily N2O fluxes, increasing the number or size of the gas chambers could minimize the large variability, and mainly the rainfall and N inputs regulated its emissions in the humid tropics of Malaysia. 3aupland soils 3agreenhouse gases 3aZea mays 3ahumid tropics 3atropical soils 3anitrogen 3afallow 3adiurnal variation 3aseasonal variation 3arain 3agas emissions 3aArachis hypogaea 3acrop rotation 3acropping sequence 3anitrous oxide 3aMalaysia 0atemporal variation 0acropping systems1 aCleemput, O. van1 aRosenani, A.B.1 aSchmidhalter, U.0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g2007, v. 38, no. 1-2 p.189-204x0010-36247nnas  aDNAL  a20070731b20070802c00000000  aINDdLYNe2007/05/07  aOther US 7aarticle03239naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002600152245011600178300001600294500001500310520213000325650001902455650002902474650001502503653002702518653000802545653001402553653001502567653001502582700002602597773011902623852000902742856009202751930003302843946001302876655001202889IND4435847420221120145849.0100423e201005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443584742DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1541-0072.2010.00361.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRobards, Martin David10aEvaluating Comanagement for Social-Ecological Fit: Indigenous Priorities and Agency Mandates for Pacific Walrus  ap. 257-279.  a2019-12-04  aGovernance arrangements such as comanagement are regarded by many as promising arenas for effective natural resource management. However, measuring comanagement's success at achieving conservation goals has been equivocal. Our research evaluates the lack of conclusive outcomes through a critical consideration of how different goals and values inherent in comanagement affect the institutional (or policy) diagnostic of "fit." More narrowly, sustaining natural resources requires that management policies foster fit between the scales of sociopolitical processes governing resource use and the scales of ecological processes regulating a resource. Without a process that encourages such harmonization, theoretical and empirical evidence suggests that comanagement regimes are unlikely to accomplish long-term conservation goals. We use a case study of walrus comanagement under the U.S. Marine Mammal Protection Act to demonstrate that when the formal institutions preconditioning comanagement do not develop out of a deliberative process among comanagement partners, two major problems can arise: (i) Policy institutions mismatch ecological and social processes relevant to resources and communities; and (ii) data to assess the fit of institutions and support learning is more difficult to acquire. In our case study, both these factors constrain the ability of comanagement to foster walrus conservation or support the capacity of Native Alaskans to adapt to contemporary social and environmental conditions. Our research concludes that to achieve marine mammal conservation, previous institutional arrangements framing comanagement that are predicated on static conceptions of people and ecosystems must be redesigned to provide better policy fit across local to international priorities. To do so requires opening up deliberative spaces, where Western science and priorities are confronted with indigenous perspectives. However, the benefit of enhancing deliberation carries risks and costs related to trade-offs between the values of democratic process, and protections for both wildlife species and indigenous groups. 3amarine mammals 3acollaborative management 3agovernance 0adeliberative democracy 0afit 0adiscourse 0aadaptation 0aindigenous1 aLovecraft, Amy Lauren0 tPolicy studies journal.g2010 May, v. 38, no. 2 p.257-279dMalden, USA : Blackwell Publishing Incx0190-292X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1541-0072.2010.00361.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100423b20100501c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02385naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001800164245008500182300001600267520112000283650001701403650001201420650002901432650002501461650002601486650003301512653001701545653002701562653002001589653002101609653001601630700002901646700002001675700002401695773011801719852000901837856008501846930003301931946001101964655001201975IND4436752120221120135509.0100507e201006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443675212DNAL7 a203398652pmid7 a10.1007/s00422-010-0382-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWilson, Emma 10aIsometric force generated by locust skeletal muscle: responses to single stimuli  ap. 503-511.  aA mathematical model of the locust hind leg extensor muscle is described. The model accounts for the force response of the muscle to well-separated input stimuli under isometric conditions. Experimental data was collected by stimulating the extensor muscle and measuring the force generated at the tibia. In developing a model it was assumed that the response to a single isolated stimulus was linear. A linear model was found to fit well to the response to an isolated stimulus. No assumptions were made about the model order and models of various order were fitted to data in the frequency domain, using a least squares fit. The stimulus can be approximated as an impulse, with the response to each stimulus well described by a linear second-order system. Using a third-order model provided a better fit to data, but the improvement in fit was marginal and the model uses one extra parameter. A fourth-order model, which is often used to describe the behaviour of isometric muscle was found to overfit the data. Using a second-order model provides a simpler way of describing the behaviour of an isometric twitch. 3agrasshoppers 2aAnimals 2aGrasshoppersxphysiology 2aHindlimbxphysiology 2aIsometric Contraction 2aMuscle, Skeletalxphysiology 0aMuscle model 0aLocust extensor muscle 0aTwitch response 0aIsometric muscle 0aModel order1 aRustighi, E.q(Emiliano)1 aMace, Brian R. 1 aNewland, Philip L. 0 tBiological cybernetics.g2010 June, v. 102, no. 6 p.503-511dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0340-12007nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00422-010-0382-x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100508b20100605c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03647naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002000152245014200172300001600314520214800330650001302478650002902491650001202520650000902532650001102541650002102552650002302573650002202596650001802618650002302636650002202659650001602681651001602697651001002713653002402723653001602747653001102763653002002774653002302794700002102817700002102838700002102859773012802880852000903008856009203017930003303109946001103142655001203153IND4427012320221120124910.0091011e200911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442701232DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1466-8238.2009.00484.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarini, Lorenzo10aContrasting response of native and alien plant species richness to environmental energy and human impact along alpine elevation gradients  ap. 652-661.  aWe tested whether the species-energy and species-human relationships vary between native and both naturalized and casual alien species richness when other environmental variables had been taken into account. Trento Province, a region (c. 6200 km²) on the southern border of the European Alps (Italy), subdivided into 156 contiguous (c. 37.5 km²) cells and ranging in elevation from 66 to 3769 m. Data were separated into three subsets, representing richness of natives, naturalized aliens and casual aliens and separately related to temperature, human population and various environmental correlates of plant species diversity. We applied ordinary least squares and simultaneous autoregressive regressions to identify potential contrasting responses of the three plant status subsets and hierarchical partitioning to evaluate the relative importance of the predictor variables. Variation in alien plant species richness along the region was almost entirely explained by temperature and human population density. The relationships were positive but strongly curvilinear. Native species richness was less strongly related to either factor but was positively related to the presence of calcareous bedrock. Native species richness had a decelerating positive relationship with temperature (R²= 55%), whereas naturalized and casual aliens had a positive accelerating relationship explaining 86% and 62% of the variation in richness, respectively. Native species richness had a positive decelerating relationship with population density (R²= 42%), whilst both alien subsets had a positive accelerating relationship. Alien species richness was higher in areas with the most rich and diverse assemblages of native species. Areas at high altitudes are not especially prone to alien invasion due to energy constraints, low propagule pressure and disturbance, even considering a potential increased in temperature. Thus, if we consider future environmental change, we should expect a stronger response of aliens than natives in the currently warm, urbanized, low-altitude areas than in cold, high-altitude areas where human population density is low. 3aaltitude 3aanthropogenic activities 3abedrock 3acold 3aenergy 3ahuman population 3aindigenous species 3aintroduced plants 3aleast squares 3apopulation density 3aspecies diversity 3atemperature 3aAlps region 3aItaly 0aBiological invasion 0adisturbance 0aexotic 0aland-use change 0apropagule pressure1 aGaston, Kevin J.1 aProsser, Filippo1 aHulme, Philip E.0 tGlobal ecology and biogeography.g2009 Nov., v. 18, no. 6 p.652-661dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1466-822X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1466-8238.2009.00484.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20091012b20091106c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02706naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002000152245012800172300001800300520130900318650001501627650001601642650000901658650002301667650002101690650002001711650002001731650002401751653001201775653002501787653003001812653002101842653001501863700002001878700002201898700001401920700001701934700001801951700002101969773011301990852000902103856009202112939003302204946001102237655001202248IND4427016820221120124922.0091011e200911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442701682DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1742-4658.2009.07334.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBunse, Stefanie14aThe potassium channel subunit Kvβ3 interacts with pannexin 1 and attenuates its sensitivity to changes in redox potentials  ap. 6258-6270.  aPannexin 1 (Panx1), a member of the second gap junction protein family identified in vertebrates, appears to preferentially form non-junctional membrane channels. A candidate regulatory protein of Panx1 is the potassium channel subunit Kvβ3, previously identified by bacterial two-hybrid strategies. Here, we report on the physical association of Panx1 with Kvβ3 by immunoprecipitation when co-expressed in a neuroblastoma cell line (Neuro2A). Furthermore, in vivo co-expression of Panx1 and Kvβ3 was shown to occur in murine hippocampus and cerebellum. Kvβ3 is known to accelerate inactivation of otherwise slowly inactivating potassium channels under reducing conditions. We subsequently found that Panx1 channel currents exhibit a significant reduction when exposed to reducing agents, and that this effect is attenuated in the presence of Kvβ3. Apparently, Kvβ3 is involved in regulating the susceptibility of Panx1 channels to redox potential. Furthermore, the Panx1 channel blockers carbenoxolone and Probenecid were less effective in inhibiting Panx1 currents when Kvβ3 was co-expressed. The influence of Kvβ3 on Panx1 is the first example of modulation of Panx1 channel function(s) by interacting proteins, and suggests the physiological importance of sensing changes in redox potentials. 3acerebellum 3ahippocampus 3amice 3apotassium channels 3aprecipitin tests 3aredox potential 3areducing agents 3aregulatory proteins 0achannel 0ainteracting proteins 0apotassium channel subunit 0adrug sensitivity 0amodulation1 aLocovei, Silviu1 aSchmidt, Matthias1 aQiu, Feng1 aZoidl, Georg1 aDahl, Gerhard1 aDermietzel, Rolf0 tFEBS journal.g2009 Nov., v. 276, no. 21 p.6258-6270dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1742-464X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1742-4658.2009.07334.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20110802  aNon-US 7aarticle02418naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024004200110040001800152100001400170245015600184300001800340520085900358650002101217650001801238650001301256650002101269650001001290650002101300650002201321650001201343650002301355650002701378650003501405650006001440650002401500650002401524650003601548650003001584700001301614700001701627700001401644700001701658773009101675852000901766856009201775930003301867945001301900946001101913655001201924IND2196176320221120124757.0981226e199806  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219617632DNAL7 a97173042pmid7 a10.1046/j.1365-2672.1998.00434.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJin, L.Z.10aNote: lack of influence of adherent Lactobacillus isolates on the attachment of Escherichia coli to the intestinal epithelial cells of chicken in vitro  ap. 1171-1174.  aTwo Lactobacillus isolates, Lact. acidophilus I 26 and Lact. fermentum I 25, were selected, based on their poor aggregation with Escherichia coli and strong ability to adhere to ileal epithelial cells (IEC), to study in vitro interactions with E. coli O1:K1, O2:K1 and O78:K80 in an IEC radioactive-assay under the conditions of exclusion (lactobacilli and IEC, followed by the addition of E. coli), competition (lactocilli, IEC and E. coli together) and displacement (E. coli and IEC, followed by the addition of lactobacilli).

Two types are known: those that cleave mRNA codons at the ribosomal A site and those that cleave any RNA site specifically. RelE of Escherichia coli cleaves mRNA at the ribosomal A site in vivo and in vitro but does not cleave pure RNA in vitro. RelE exhibits an incomplete RNase fold that may explain why RelE requires its substrate mRNA to presented by the ribosome. In contrast, RelE homologue YoeB has a complete RNase fold and cleaves RNA independently of ribosomes in vitro. Here, we show that YoeB cleavage of mRNA is strictly dependent on translation of the mRNA in vivo. Non-translated model mRNAs were not cleaved whereas the corresponding wild-type mRNAs were cleaved efficiently. Model mRNAs carrying frameshift mutations exhibited a YoeB-mediated cleavage pattern consistent with the reading frameshift thus giving strong evidence that YoeB cleavage specificity was determined by the translational reading frame. In contrast, site-specific mRNA cleavage by MazF occurred independently of translation. In one case, translation seriously influenced MazF cleavage efficiency, thus solving a previous apparent paradox. We propose that translation enhances MazF-mediated cleavage of mRNA by destabilization of the mRNA secondary structure.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEscherichia coli 3acodons 3aframeshift mutation 3aloci 3amessenger RNA 3amodels 3aribonucleases 3aribosomes 3atranslation (genetics)1 aGerdes, Kenn0 tNucleic acids research.g2008 Nov., v. 36, no. 20 p.6472-6481x0305-10487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkn6673Available from publisher's Web site  a20081114b20081206c00000000  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02928naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092024002200120024001900142040001800161100002300179245011600202300001800318506007600336520141300412506003701825650000801862650001501870650003201885650000801917650001901925650002401944650001301968650001701981650002401998650001102022650002102033650001602054650001302070650002902083650001102112700001902123700001702142700002602159773008302185852000902268856007802277930003302355946001102388990002302399655001202422IND4412553520221207120838.0081114e200811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441255352DNAL7 a10.1093/nar/gkn6572doi7 aPMC25826122pmcid7 a188543512pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDimitri, Alexandra10aTranscription elongation past O⁶-methylguanine by human RNA polymerase II and bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase  ap. 6459-6471.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aO⁶-Methylguanine (O⁶-meG) is a major mutagenic, carcinogenic and cytotoxic DNA adduct produced by various endogenous and exogenous methylating agents. We report the results of transcription past a site-specifically modified O⁶-meG DNA template by bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase and human RNA polymerase II. These data show that O⁶-meG partially blocks T7 RNA polymerase and human RNA polymerase II elongation. In both cases, the sequences of the truncated transcripts indicate that both polymerases stop precisely at the damaged site without nucleotide incorporation opposite the lesion, while extensive misincorporation of uracil is observed in the full-length RNA. For both polymerases, computer models suggest that bypass occurs only when O⁶-meG adopts an anti conformation around its glycosidic bond, with the methyl group in the proximal orientation; in contrast, blockage requires the methyl group to adopt a distal conformation. Furthermore, the selection of cytosine and uracil partners opposite O⁶-meG is rationalized with modeled hydrogen-bonding patterns that agree with experimentally observed O⁶-meG:C and O⁶-meG:U pairing schemes. Thus, in vitro, O⁶-meG contributes substantially to transcriptional mutagenesis. In addition, the partial blockage of RNA polymerase II suggests that transcription-coupled DNA repair could play an auxiliary role in the clearance of this lesion.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aDNA repair 3aDNA-directed RNA polymerase 3aRNA 3abacteriophages 3acomputer simulation 3acytosine 3acytotoxicity 3aglycosidic linkages 3ahumans 3ahydrogen bonding 3amutagenesis 3amutagens 3atranscription (genetics) 3auracil1 aBurns, John A.1 aBroyde, Suse1 aScicchitano, David A.0 tNucleic acids research.g2008 Nov., v. 36, no. 20 p.6459-6471x0305-10487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkn6573Available from publisher's Web site  a20081114b20081206c00000000  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02667naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002000152245013500172300001600307500002400323520141400347650001601761650001401777650000901791650001401800650002501814650001801839650001401857650002401871650001301895650001501908650002701923650001001950651001601960651001701976651000901993700001902002700001702021700001702038773011402055852000902169856005502178655001202233IND4457773220221120095703.0110507e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445777322DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1439-0426.2010.01616.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAl-Marzouqi, A.10aFishing pattern and management scenarios of Epinephelus gabriellae (Randall and Heemstra, 1991) fisheries in the Arabian Sea, Oman  ap. 820-826.  aIncludes references  aManagement of fish resources in the Western Indian Ocean is complicated due to the lack of data on the basic biology and landing statistics for exploited fish species. In this paper, a database including biological parameters, length frequency distributions and catches of Epinephelus gabriellae in Oman according to fleet components has been established to develop a management plan for its sustainable exploitation. Length cohort analyses and yield per recruit were examined by simulating changes in fishing effort in length at first capture and by introducing a seasonal ban for trawlers. The results showed a high sensitivity to the applied value of natural mortality (M). (i) With M = 0.40, a healthy status of the stock is observed; however, with M values of 0.20 and 0.15 the stock appears slightly overexploited, and actual F exceeds 10 and 30% of the F₀₁ level, respectively. (ii) A moderate increase of length at first capture would not significantly affect the long-term yield or stock spawning biomass; however, a substantial length increase would in the long-term lead to a decrease in yields for the artisanal fleet using traps. (iii) A seasonal ban regulation for trawlers would not have a significant effect on the sustainable yield, but if the fishing effort were to increase considerably, a significant long-term gain in yield would be obtained with a closed season from April-September. 3aEpinephelus 3adatabases 3afish 3afisheries 3afisheries management 3afishing boats 3amortality 3aresource management 3aspawning 3astatistics 3atraditional technology 3atraps 3aArabian Sea 3aIndian Ocean 3aOman1 aBen Meriem, S.1 aAl-Waili, H.1 aAl-Habsi, S.0 tJournal of applied ichthyology.g2011 June, v. 27, no. 3 p.820-826dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0175-86597nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0426.2010.01616.x 7aarticle03222naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129100001600146245014300162300001600305500001500321520121800336650002401554650001301578650001301591650000901604650001401613650002301627650003101650650002101681650001701702650001401719650001401733650001901747650002101766650001201787650000901799650007901808650007101887650001801958650001101976650004901987650002002036650000902056650006402065650002702129650002302156653001702179653002002196700002102216700001902237700001602256700001702272700001902289700001602308700001502324700002202339700001702361773007802378852000902456930003302465945002502498946001302523655001202536IND4362343820221120095632.0040504e200312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436234382DNAL7 a147278162pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The four dogs, all purpose bred, came from three vendors and had received the standard canine vaccines prior to shipment. In each instance, the affected dog had been shipped to our facility within the past 10 days. Three cases presented as a peracute clinical syndrome, and all had gross and microscopic findings consistent with hemorrhagic pneumonia. Escherichia coli was isolated from the lungs of all four dogs. Results of testing of lung tissue for canine parainfluenza virus and canine adenovirus were negative. Escherichia coli was also isolated from blood of three of the four dogs. Serotyping of the E. coli isolates indicated that two were serotype O6 and two were O4. Isolates from all four dogs were positive for the virulence factors alpha hemolysin and cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1 and for the adhesin factor class-III papG allele. These traits place the isolates in the class of extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli, which is being increasingly implicated as a cause of extraintestinal infections in animals and humans and may represent a zoonotic risk to humans working with research dogs. 3abacterial pneumonia 3azoonoses 3aadhesins 3adogs 3aserotypes 3alaboratory animals 3aanimal pathogenic bacteria 3aanimal transport 3apathogenesis 3avirulence 3amortality 3adisease course 3aEscherichia coli 2aAnimals 2aDogs 2aEscherichia colixclassificationxisolation & purificationxpathogenicity. 2aEscherichia coli Infectionsxcomplicationsxpathologyxveterinary. 2aFatal Outcome 2aFemale 2aHemorrhagexetiologyxpathologyxveterinary. 2aLungxpathology 2aMale 2aPneumonia, Bacterialxcomplicationsxpathologyxveterinary. 2aSerotypingxveterinary 2aTracheaxpathology 0aepidemiology 0aperacute course1 aStoffregen, D.A.1 aPrescott, J.S.1 aPouch, W.J.1 aNgai, D.T.W.1 aAnderson, C.A.1 aGatto, N.T.1 aDebRoy, C.1 aFairbrother, J.M.1 aMotzel, S.L.0 tComparative medicine.g2003 Dec., v. 53, no. 6 p.663-670x1532-08207nnas  aDNAL  a20040830b20040901c00000000  aINDdJITe2004/08/18  aOther US 7aarticle03035naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146100001800163245007700181300001600258520159600274650002301870650002301893650001101916650002601927650000901953650002001962650001401982650002501996650003002021650002602051650001302077650001002090650001102100650002602111650001302137650002802150650001902178650001202197650004402209650003402253650003302287650001302320650001402333773007802347852000902425930003302434945002502467946001302492655001202505IND4363295020221120095620.0040712e200304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436329502DNAL7 a127848462pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aPinkert, C.A.10aTransgenic animal technology: alternatives in genotyping and phenotyping  ap. 126-139.  aOver the past decade, breakthrough technologies in transgenic animal technology and functional genomics have played a central role in the explosive growth of rodent modeling and in scientific innovation. Various noninvasive alternatives to routine surgical biopsy have been described for genotypic and phenotypic analyses of laboratory animals. A number of options are available to refine or replace potentially painful and invasive procedures ranging from tissue biopsies (including tail biopsies and toe docking) to several blood sampling techniques. Unfortunately adoption of many non- or minimally invasive alternatives has proven difficult on a number of fronts ranging from historical reservations to procedural expectations and actual experimental productivity. Similarly, a variety of phenotyping considerations have addressed throughput efficiencies and the health and well being of research animals. From an animal welfare perspective, marked increases in laboratory animal populations have accompanied rapid advancements spanning the life sciences. As described for rodent modeling, but with applications across many laboratory animal species, diverse procedural refinements are available that will readily aid in the analysis of whole animal models. Ultimately, non-invasive technologies and complementary refinements have bearing on the quality and reproducibility of data that are reported, as well as of critical importance to the well being and ethical management of animals at all developmental stages: from fetal existence, to the neonatal period, and on through adulthood. 3atransgenic animals 3alaboratory animals 3abiopsy 3aanimal use refinement 3amice 3agene expression 3aphenotype 3aphenotypic variation 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aanimal identification 3asampling 3afeces 3asaliva 3amicroarray technology 3agenomics 2aAnimal Use Alternatives 2aAnimal Welfare 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Genetically Modifiedxgenetics 2aAnimals, Laboratoryxgenetics 2aGenetic Engineeringxmethods 2aGenotype 2aPhenotype0 tComparative medicine.g2003 Apr., v. 53, no. 2 p.126-139x1532-08207nnas  aDNAL  a20040830b00000000c00000000  aINDdJITe2004/07/29  aOther US 7aarticle03191naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003500110040001800145100001800163245018300181300001600364520161400380650000901994650002302003650003002026650003202056650002302088650001502111650001402126650001802140650002102158650002502179650001802204650001202222650003302234650002002267650002702287650002002314650004102334650003302375650001302408653001502421700001502436773008302451852000902534856008502543930003302628945001302661946001102674655001202685IND2050543820221120090945.0960327e199507  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205054382DNAL7 a75897172pmid7 a10.1080/026520395093743422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchenck, F.J.10aScreening procedure for organochlorine and organophosphorus pesticide residues in milk using matrix solid phase dispersion (MSPD) extraction and gas chromatographic determination  ap. 535-541.  aA rapid technique for the extraction and gas chromatographic determination of five organochlorine and five organophosphorus pesticide residues in milk is described. Milk (5.0 ml) is blended with 2.0 g of C18 [octadecylsilyl-derivatized silica] and 1.5 ml acetonitrile in a syringe barrel. After the aqueous phase is removed from the column by vacuum aspiration, the pesticide residues are eluted from the C18/milk matrix with acetonitrile which is then eluted through a Florisil solid phase extraction (SPE) column. The acetonitrile is evaporated under nitrogen and the residue is dissolved in petroleum ether. This extract is directly analysed for organophosphorus pesticides by gas chromatography with flame photometric detection. After further clean-up of the extract on a mini-Florisil column, the organochlorine pesticide residues are determined by gas chromatography with electron capture detection. Grade A homogenized and raw milk samples were fortified with five organochlorine and five organophosphorus pesticide residues. The average recoveries of fortified organochlorine pesticide residues (2.0-20 ppb) ranged from 76.0% to 97.8%. The average recoveries of fortified organophosphorus pesticide residues (10-50 ppb) ranged from 75.0% to 104.5%. The MSPD and the AOAC International multiresidue method for pesticides in milk produced comparable results for milk samples containing incurred organochlorine pesticide residues. The use of the MSPD method results in a 90% reduction in organic solvent consumption and a 95% reduction in the hazardous waste generated when compared with the AOAC method. 3amilk 3apesticide residues 3aorganochlorine pesticides 3aorganophosphorus pesticides 3agas chromatography 3aextraction 3ascreening 3afood analysis 3afood composition 3achemical composition 2aAcetonitriles 2aAnimals 2aChromatography, Gasxmethods 2aHazardous Waste 2aInsecticidesxanalysis 2aMilkxchemistry 2aOrganophosphorus Compoundsxanalysis 2aPesticide Residuesxanalysis 2aSolvents 0adispersion1 aWagner, R.0 tFood additives & contaminants.g1995 , v. 12, no. 4 p.535-541x0265-203X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/026520395093743423Available from publisher's Web site  a19960331b19960404c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle03539naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001700171245007600188300001600264520163500280650002301915650002501938650001601963650001301979650001901992650002102011650001302032650001802045650002202063650002502085650002202110650001402132650001802146650001402164650001702178650001602195650001202211650004502223650006202268650004902330650001302379650002302392650002202415650002402437653001802461653001102479700001502490700001802505700001502523700001502538700001602553700001402569700001702583700001602600773012802616852000902744856009202753930003302845946001102878655001202889IND4431084020221120073405.0100111e201002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443108402DNAL7 a200025712pmid7 a10.1111/j.1472-765X.2009.02774.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarvalho, C.10aMethod for bacteriophage isolation against target Campylobacter strains  ap. 192-197.  aPoultry meat is considered a major source of Campylobacter. This micro-aerobic bacterium is commonly responsible for foodborne illness. This work focuses on the isolation of Campylobacter coli lytic bacteriophages (phages) against target C. coli strains. A method involving the enrichment of free-range chicken samples in a broth containing the target C. coli strains and salts (CaCl₂ and MgSO₄) was used for phage isolation. This method allowed the isolation of 43 phages that were active against 83% of the C. coli strains used in the isolation procedure. Approximately 65% of the phages were also effective against Campylobacter jejuni strains. The use of target pathogens in the phage isolation step improves the likelihood of detecting and isolating phages for the control of these specific strains. This technique will be valuable in the context of phage therapy for enriching for phages that are active against specifically identified strains of bacteria, for example from a food poisoning outbreak or epidemic strains resistant to multiple antibiotics. In these situations, using the conventional methods for searching for bacteriophages active for these particular strains can be a time-consuming, if not an unsuccessful process. Using the isolation method described in this manuscript, the particular strains can be added to the enrichment broth increasing the probability of finding phages against them. Therefore, it will shorten the time needed for seeking phages able to lyse target strains, which in most of the cases, because of the rapid increase in antimicrobial-resistant bacteria, is of crucial importance. 3aCampylobacter coli 3aCampylobacter jejuni 3aantibiotics 3abacteria 3abacteriophages 3acalcium chloride 3achickens 3aculture media 3afoodborne illness 3aisolation techniques 3amagnesium sulfate 3apathogens 3aphage therapy 3apoisoning 3apoultry meat 3aprobability 2aAnimals 2aBacteriophagesxisolation & purification 2aCampylobacter Infectionsxprevention & controlxvirology. 2aCampylobacter colixpathogenicityxvirology. 2aChickens 2aFood Contamination 2aFood Microbiology 2aSpecies Specificity 0aBacteriophage 0amethod1 aSusano, M.1 aFernandes, E.1 aSantos, S.1 aGannon, B.1 aNicolau, A.1 aGibbs, P.1 aTeixeira, P.1 aAzeredo, J.0 tLetters in applied microbiology.g2010 Feb., v. 50, no. 2 p.192-197dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0266-82547nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1472-765X.2009.02774.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100111b20100205c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02137naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002500152245010500177300001600282520120900298653001201507653002201519653002501541653002101566700002201587700001901609773010501628852000901733856009201742946001301834655001201847IND4439624120221120073504.0100709e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443962412DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1748-7692.2009.00369.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAuger-Méthé, Marie10aNicks and notches of the dorsal ridge: Promising mark types for the photo-identification of narwhals  ap. 663-678.  aThe narwhal is a hunted species for which we have many knowledge gaps. Photo-identification, which uses photographs of natural markings to identify individuals, is widely used in cetacean studies and can address a broad range of biological questions. However, it has not been developed for narwhals. The marks used for other cetaceans are inappropriate for this species either because narwhals lack the body part on which these marks are found or because the marks are known to change with time. We investigated the marks apparent in photographs of narwhals. Nicks and notches on the dorsal ridge are the mark types most promising for photo-identification. They are found on 91%-98% of the individuals, thus allowing the identification of a large part of the population. They can be used to differentiate between individuals, in part because they are variable in their location, numbers, shape, and size. Although our results suggest that nicks and notches are relatively stable over time, rates of change should be formally measured to assess the probability of photographic matches over multiple years. However, we are confident that these marks can be used in studies spanning at least a field season. 0anarwhal 0aMonodon monoceros 0aphoto-identification 0anatural markings1 aMarcoux, Marianne1 aWhitehead, Hal0 tMarine mammal science.g2010 July, v. 26, no. 3 p.663-678dBlackwell Publishing Incx0824-04697nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1748-7692.2009.00369.x3Available from publisher's Web site  aOther US 7aarticle02137naa a2200265 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002100152245010000173300001600273520123600289650001901525653002101544653002401565700001901589773010601608852000901714856009201723930003301815946001101848655001201859IND4432884520221120073416.0100220e201003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443288452DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2818.2009.03316.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWIERZBIŃSKA, M.10aMicrostructural changes to AlCu₆Ni₁ alloy after prolonged annealing at elevated temperature  ap. 516-520.  aThis work presents results of microstructure examination of AlCu₆Ni₁ aluminium alloy. The commercial AlCu₄Ni₂Mg₂ (M-309) alloy is widely used for elements of aircraft and automotive engines. Modification its chemical composition was aimed at improving the stability of mechanical properties of the alloy subjected to long-term exposure to high temperature. The alloy after standard T6 heat treatment (solution heat treated at 818 K/10 h/water quenched followed by ageing at 498 K/8 h/air cooled) was annealed for 150 h at elevated temperature of 573 K corresponding to the maximum value at which structural elements of jet piston engines made of aluminium alloys operate. It was found that applied heat treatment caused an increasing in the particles of hardening phase (θ′-Al₂Cu) size. The significant growth of the length of θ′-Al₂Cu precipitations was observed in particularly. Nevertheless, it did not strongly result in change of its shape - the 'crystallites' and 'rods' were still characteristic of hardening phase morphology. The phenomena of the growth of θ′-Al₂Cu precipitates caused decreasing the mechanical properties of the alloy, what is the subject of further investigations by the authors. 3aheat treatment 0aAluminium alloys 0aintermetallic phase1 aSIENIAWSKI, J.0 tJournal of microscopy.g2010 Mar., v. 237, no. 3 p.516-520dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0022-27207nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2818.2009.03316.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100220b20100305c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03601naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002700164245004700191300001600238500001500254520222000269650002202489650001602511650001702527650001502544650003702559650003102596650001102627650003302638650003902671650002402710650005402734653001702788653002002805653001702825653001202842700001802854700001902872773011402891852000903005856008503014930003303099946001103132655001203143IND4438139520221123015733.0100604e201006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443813952DNAL7 a199977222pmid7 a10.1007/s00240-009-0244-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFazil Marickar, Y. M. 10aEffect of blind treatment on stone disease  ap. 205-209.  a2019-12-04  aMost of the drugs administered to stone patients appear to be inappropriate and doing more harm than good to the patients. The objective of this paper is to identify the prevalence of blind chemotherapy among the stone patients and find out the real indication for the drugs administered. Patients who attended the stone clinic for the first time were interviewed to find out what drugs they had been taking before the attendance at the stone clinic. 350 patients consuming specific drugs relevant to stone formation at least for a period of 15 days were selected for a detailed assessment. The type of drug consumed, the dose, the duration, the side effects, compliance rate and effect on stone disease were assessed. The biochemical profile of the patients was assessed to identify the role of the therapeutic modalities utilised. Conclusions regarding the utility of drugs in the process of stone formation were made. The values were compared with those of patients not on medication and considering laboratory standards. Of the 350 patients studied, 96 patients were consuming potassium citrate in different doses, 50 were consuming allopurinol, 44 cystone, 27 potassium citrate + magnesium, 25 calcury, 24 rowatinex, 21 ayurvedic drugs, 17 dystone, 17 homeopathic medicines and 17 other drugs. The longest duration of compliance was for cystone—2.5 years. All other drugs were stopped by the patients themselves due to recurrence of symptoms. As much as 93% of the patients did not feel that there was any significant relief of symptoms. The side effects which prompted the patients to stop medicine were gastro intestinal upset, particularly with potassium citrate, rowatinex and potassium citrate + magnesium combination. The relevant biochemical changes noted were increased urinary citrate levels in patients consuming potassium citrate alone or in combination with magnesium. Serum uric acid was within normal limits in patients consuming allopurinol. Urine uric acid levels were also lower in patients on allopurinol. It is concluded that most of the drugs administered blindly were neither indicated nor beneficial for the patients. Metabolic correction has to be based on proper metabolic assessment. 3ahomeopathic drugs 3aallopurinol 3adrug therapy 3apyridoxine 2aAntimetabolitesxtherapeutic use 2aDiureticsxtherapeutic use 2aHumans 2aKidney Calculixdrug therapy 2aPotassium Citratextherapeutic use 2aSingle-Blind Method 2aUrolithiasisxdrug therapyxprevention & control. 0achemotherapy 0aAyurvedic drugs 0aUrolithiasis 0aCitrate1 aSalim, Abiya 1 aVijay, Adarsh 0 tUrological research.g2010 June, v. 38, no. 3 p.205-209dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0300-56237nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00240-009-0244-y3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100604b20100703c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02549naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024004200110040001800152100001700170245012300187300001600310520094500326650002601271650001201297650003201309650001101341650001901352650002301371650001801394650002101412650002701433650003901460650001601499650003201515650002701547650003101574650005601605650002601661650001601687650007201703700001501775700001801790773008901808852000901897856009201906930003301998945001302031946001102044655001202055IND2197235820221122154203.0990225e199810  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219723582DNAL7 a98123832pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-2672.1998.00580.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGeimba, M.P.10aPurification and characterization of beta-N-acetylhexosaminidase from the phytopathogenic fungus Bipolaris sorokiniana  ap. 708-714.  aN-acetylhexosaminidase (HEX) from the phytopathogenic fungus Bipolaris sorokiniana was isolated and characterized. The production of HEX by B. sorokiniana was not altered by growing on different carbon sources. Enzyme purification was carried out by sequential liquid chromatography on Sephacryl S-200 HR, and p-aminobenzyl-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-beta-D-thioglucopyranoside agarose. The purification was about 70-fold, with a yield of 41%, determined with p-nitrophenyl-N-acetylglucosaminide as substrate. The enzyme had pH and temperature optima of 4(.)5 and 55 degrees C, respectively. The molecular weight of non-denatured enzyme was estimated as 120000 Da by gel filtration chromatography, and about 55000 Da by SDS-PAGE. The fungal HEX had glycosylated residues as evidenced by binding to Concanavalin-A. Bipolaris sorokiniana enzyme was also active with p-nitrophenyl-chitobioside and p-nitrophenyl-N-acetylgalactosaminide as substrates. 3aBipolaris sorokiniana 3aagarose 3abeta-N-acetylhexosaminidase 3acarbon 3aconcanavalin A 3agel chromatography 3aglycosylation 3amolecular weight 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3atemperature 2aCarbohydratesxpharmacology 2aGlycosidesxmetabolism 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aMitosporic Fungixenzymologyxgrowth & development. 2aSubstrate Specificity 2aTemperature 2abeta-N-Acetylhexosaminidasesxisolation & purificationxmetabolism.1 aRiffel, A.1 aBrandelli, A.0 tJournal of applied microbiology.g1998 Oct., v. 85, no. 4 p.708-714x1364-50727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2672.1998.00580.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a19990405b19990413c00000000  aINDdGK1  aNon-US 7aarticle02106naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003500110040001800145100002400163245007200187300001600259500014500275500001500420520039100435650002500826650001800851650002300869650002100892650001900913650001900932650001300951650002400964650004100988650001901029650003301048650004701081650002901128650004101157650002101198650002201219650002301241650002101264651001601285653002701301653001401328773008301342852000901425856008501434930003301519945001301552946001101565655001201576IND2041209320221122154229.0940802e199403  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204120932DNAL7 a80395742pmid7 a10.1080/026520394093742122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLierop, J.B.H. van.10aEnforcement of European Community legislation at the national level  ap. 131-139.  aPaper presented at the "Sixth International Symposium on Migration in Food Packaging Plastics," May 19-20, 1992, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.  a2019-12-04  aThe Dutch system for screening food contact materials, in which global migration no longer has any function, has been applied.

Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: Population study, Denmark. Subjects: A total of 175 men and 173 women aged 30-60 y, selected randomly from a larger population sample of Danish adults. Interventions: All subjects had habitual diet intake assessed by a diet history interview and completed a 7 day food record within 3 weeks following the interview. The diet history interview and coding of records were performed by the same trained dietician. Main outcome measure: Median between-method difference in assessment of total energy intake, absolute intake of macronutrients, and nutrient energy percentages. Difference between reported energy intake from both methods and estimated energy expenditure in different subgroups. Results: Energy and macronutrient intake was assessed slightly higher by the 7 day food record than by the diet history interview, but in absolute terms the differences were negligible. The between-method difference in assessment of total energy intake appeared to be stable over the range of age and BMI in both sexes. As compared to estimated total energy expenditure, both diet assessment methods underestimated energy intake by approximately 20%. For both methods the under-reporting increased by BMI in both sexes and by age in men. Conclusions: Energy and macronutrient intake data collected under even conditions by either a 7 day food record or a diet history interview may be collapsed and analysed independent of the underlying diet method. Both diet methods, however, appear to underestimate energy intake dependent on age and BMI. 3amen 3awomen 3aenergy intake 3anutrient intake 3afood intake 3afood choices 3adietary surveys 3ainterviews 3aage 3abody weight 3adietitians 3agender differences 2aAdult 2aAge Factors 2aBody Mass Index 2aCross-Sectional Studies 2aDiet Records 2aDiet Surveys 2aDietary Carbohydratesxadministration & dosage 2aDietary Fatsxadministration & dosage 2aDietary Proteinsxadministration & dosage 2aEnergy Intakexphysiology 2aEnergy Metabolismxphysiology 2aFemale 2aFeeding Behavior. 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aSurveys and Questionnairesxstandards. 2aReproducibility of Results 3aDenmark 0aDenmark 0aerrors1 aAndreasen, A.H.1 aOsler, M.1 aPedersen, A.N.1 aJorgensen, L.M.1 aJorgensen, T.1 aSchroll, M.1 aHeitmann, B.L.0 tEuropean journal of clinical nutrition.g2002 Feb., v. 56, no. 2 p.105-113x0954-30077nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sj.ejcn.16012923Available from publisher's Web site  a20021002b20021010c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02584naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003300111040001800144100001600162245012000178300001800298520112300316650000801439650001601447650001601463650001701479650002301496650001201519650001401531650001801545650001401563650001501577650001001592650004201602650004501644650002201689650003301711650001101744650000901755650001401764650001001778700001901788773009901807852000901906856008301915930003301998945001302031946001102044990002302055655001202078IND2324720320221122154231.0020104e200111  uk |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232472032DNAL7 a116417522pmid7 a10.1038/sj.ejcn.16012622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCooling, J.10aHigh-fat and low-fat phenotypes: habitual eating of high- and low-fat foods not related to taste preference for fat  ap. 1016-1021.  aObjective: To characterize taste preferences in habitual high fat (HF) and low fat (LF) phenotypes. Design: Eighteen test solutions to taste for each subject group in a fully repeated 2x6x3 measures design. Setting: The Human Appetite Research Unit at Leeds University, Psychology Department. Subjects: Eight lean HF (mean percentage fat intake 43.4% daily energy) and eight lean LF (mean percentage fat intake 32.7% daily energy) were recruited from the staff/student population of Leeds University. Interventions: All subjects were required to taste 18 solutions based on six levels of fat content and three levels of sucrose content. Subjects rated each solution for fat content, sweetness and pleasantness. Results: HF and LF showed significant effect for the fat content of the solution on the perception of creaminess (P < 0.000), and sugar content on the perception of sweetness (P < 0.000). HF and LF did not differ in their taste preferences and no preferred level of fat or sweetness was detected in either group. Conclusions: In young adult males, habitual food selection is not related to taste preference. 3amen 3adietary fat 3afood intake 3afood choices 3asensory evaluation 3asucrose 3asweetness 3alow fat foods 3aphenotype 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aDietary Fatsxadministration & dosage 2aDietary Sucrosexadministration & dosage 2aFeeding Behavior. 2aFood Preferencesxphysiology 2aHumans 2aMale 2aPhenotype 2aTaste1 aBlundell, J.E.0 tEuropean journal of clinical nutrition.g2001 Nov., v. 55, no. 11 p.1016-1021x0954-30077nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sj.ejcn.16012623Available from publisher's Web site  a20020301b20020307c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle03716naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003300111040001800144100001500162245016100177300001800338520169700356650002202053650001202075650000802087650001002095650002502105650002002130650001802150650002102168650001602189650001402205650001702219650001402236650000902250650002002259650002802279650001702307650001802324650001102342650002202353650001802375650002502393650002302418650002002441650001102461650000902472650002502481650005002506650002202556650002302578650001502601650002402616650003202640650001702672651002702689700001502716700001602731773009902747852000902846856008302855930003302938945001302971946001102984990002302995655001203018IND2324720820221122113036.0020104e200111  uk |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232472082DNAL7 a116417542pmid7 a10.1038/sj.ejcn.16012662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBeck, A.M.12aA six months' prospective follow-up of 65+ -y-old patients from general practice classified according to nutritional risk by the Mini Nutritional Assessment  ap. 1028-1033.  aObjective: To assess the prevalence of old people at risk of undernutrition according to the Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA), characterise the at risk group with regard to nutritional state, energy intake, and physical and mental functioning, and to assess the consequences of the MNA score over a 6 month period. Design: A cross-sectional prospective study. Setting: The clinic of a general practitioner. Subjects: Ninety-four patients 65+ -y-old with no acute illness contacted at the clinic. Sixty-one subjects (65%) agreed to participate at baseline and 34 (56%) showed up at the follow-up 6 months later. Results: At baseline, 23 (38%) participants were assessed as being at risk of undernutrition (17-23.5 MNA points). The remaining were classified as well-nourished (> 23.5 MNA points). The 23 participants at risk had a higher prevalence of body mass index (BMI) < 20 kg/m2 (44 vs 11%, P < 0.001) and insufficient energy intake (36 vs 9%, P < 0.05), compared with the well-nourished group. Also, they had a higher need of meals-on-wheels (39 vs 8%, P < 0.01) and home-care for shopping (48 vs 18%, P < 0.05) at baseline. At the 6 months' follow-up, there was a tendency to a higher non-participation rate among the participants assessed at risk of undernutrition at baseline (44 vs 18%, 0.05 < P < 0.1), compared with the well-nourished group. There was a tendency to a higher prevalence of hospitalisation (38 vs 19%, 0.05 < P < 0.1) in the at risk group. Conclusion: MNA seems to be a useful tool to identify old people who need help from the public sector. However, many in the group at risk of undernutrition already have low BMI values. This might have influenced the findings. 3adisease diagnosis 3aelderly 3amen 3awomen 3anutrition assessment 3arisk assessment 3aenergy intake 3aphysical fitness 3abody weight 3ahospitals 3amalnutrition 3acognition 2aAged 2aBody Mass Index 2aCross-Sectional Studies 2aDiet Records 2aEnergy Intake 2aFemale 2aFollow-Up Studies 2aFood Services 2aGeriatric Assessment 2aHome Care Services 2aHospitalization 2aHumans 2aMale 2aNutrition Assessment 2aNutrition Disordersxdiagnosisxepidemiology. 2aNutrition Surveys 2aNutritional Status 2aPrevalence 2aProspective Studies 2aSurveys and Questionnaires. 2aRisk Factors 0aDenmarkxepidemiology.1 aOvesen, L.1 aSchroll, M.0 tEuropean journal of clinical nutrition.g2001 Nov., v. 55, no. 11 p.1028-1033x0954-30077nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sj.ejcn.16012663Available from publisher's Web site  a20020301b20020307c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle03220naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003300111040001800144100002700162245007800189300001600267500001500283520165800298650002801956650000801984650001001992650001202002650001802014650002302032650000902055650001202064650002402076650001002100650001202110650002102122650002802143650002402171650001102195650001102206650001902217650000902236650003302245650002402278651001102302653001502313653001002328653002002338700001502358773009702373852000902470856008302479930003302562945001302595946001102608990002302619655001202642IND2324719820221122090232.0020104e200111  uk |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232471982DNAL7 a116417492pmid7 a10.1038/sj.ejcn.16012592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiljeberg Elmstahl, H.10aMilk as a supplement to mixed meals may elevate postprandial insulinaemia  ap. 994-999.  a2019-12-04  aObjective: The objective was to evaluate the impact of milk added to a high-glycaemic index (GI) white bread meal vs a low-GI spaghetti meal, respectively, on postprandial glucose and insulin responses in healthy subjects. Design: The volunteers were served the bread or spaghetti meals with either milk (200 or 400 ml, respectively) or water (400 ml) following an overnight fast. Capillary blood samples were collected before and during 3 h after the meals. Setting: The study was performed at the Department of Applied Nutrition and Food Chemistry, Lund University, Sweden. Subjects: Ten healthy volunteers, seven men and three women, aged 22-30 y, with normal body mass indices, were recruited. Results: There was no difference in postprandial glucose area under curve (AUC) with and without added milk in the case of the high-GI bread meals. As could be expected, glucose AUC after the bread meal + water was higher than after the spaghetti meal + water. Milk added at 200 or 400 ml to the spaghetti meal did not affect glucose AUC. However, a significantly higher insulin AUC was seen with the bread meal with 400 ml milk (+65%) and the spaghetti meal with 200 ml or 400 ml milk (+300%), respectively, compared with corresponding test meal with water Conclusions: The addition of milk to a low-GI spaghetti meal may significantly increase the postprandial insulinaemia. Even an ordinary amount of milk (200 ml) increased the insulin AUC to a low-GI spaghetti meal to the same level as seen with white bread. The mechanism for the insulinotrophic effect of milk is not known, and the potential long-term metabolic consequences need to be elucidated. 3acarbohydrate metabolism 3amen 3awomen 3aglucose 3ablood glucose 3agender differences 3amilk 3ainsulin 3adietary supplements 2aAdult 2aAnimals 2aArea Under Curve 2aBlood Glucosexanalysis 2aDietary Supplements 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aInsulinxblood 2aMale 2aMilkxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aPostprandial Period 3aSweden 0ametabolism 0ameals 0ablood chemistry1 aBjorck, I.0 tEuropean journal of clinical nutrition.g2001 Nov., v. 55, no. 11 p.994-999x0954-30077nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sj.ejcn.16012593Available from publisher's Web site  a20020301b20020307c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle03415naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245016500173300001600338520196800354650004302322650002602365650000902391650001602400650001902416650001002435650001402445650001002459650001602469650001902485650000702504650001902511650001402530650002702544651001802571700002802589700002202617700001802639700001702657700002102674700003102695773017102726856005102897852000902948655001202957IND60636882120221122040310.0190411e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063688212DNAL7 a10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-18-2982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThomas, Chevise L.10aValidation of Antimicrobial Interventions for Reducing Shiga Toxin–Producing Escherichia coli Surrogate Populations during Goat Slaughter and Carcass Chilling  ap. 364-370.  aDemand and consumption of goat meat is increasing in the United States due to an increase in ethnic populations that prefer goat meat. As ruminant animals, goats are known reservoirs for Shiga toxin–producing Escherichia coli (STEC) and proper handling, especially during slaughter, is imperative to reduce the likelihood of carcass and meat contamination. However, the majority of antimicrobial intervention studies during the slaughter of ruminant species have focused on beef, highlighting the need for validation studies targeting small ruminants, such as goats, during slaughter and chilling procedures. The objective of this research was to evaluate 4.5% lactic acid (LA; pH 2.1), peroxyacetic acid (PAA; 400 ppm; pH 4.7), a hydrochloric and citric acid blend (Citrilow [CL]; pH 1.2), 5% levulinic acid plus 0.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate (LVA+SDS; pH 2.60), and a nontreated control (CON) for their efficacy in reducing STEC surrogates and their effect on carcass color from slaughter through 24-h chill. Fifteen goat carcasses across three replications were inoculated with a five-strain cocktail (ca. 5 log CFU/cm2 attachment), containing rifampin-resistant surrogate E. coli (BAA-1427, BAA-1428, BAA-1429, BAA-1430, and BAA-1431) and were randomly assigned to an antimicrobial treatment. Antimicrobials were applied prechill and 24 h postchill. Mean log reductions achieved after prechill treatment with LA, PAA, CL, and LVA+SDS were 2.00, 1.86, 2.26, and 1.90 log CFU/cm(2), respectively. Antimicrobial treatment after the 24-h chilling, resulted in additional reductions of surrogate E. coli by 0.99, 1.03, 1.94, and 0.47 log CFU/cm(2) for LA, PAA, CL, and LVA+SDS, respectively. Antimicrobial treatments did not impact goat carcass objective color (L* and a*), except for b*. The antimicrobials tested in this study were able to effectively reduce surrogate STEC populations during slaughter and subsequent chilling without compromising carcass color. 3aShiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli 3aanti-infective agents 3abeef 3acitric acid 3acold treatment 3acolor 3agoat meat 3agoats 3alactic acid 3alevulinic acid 3apH 3aperacetic acid 3aslaughter 3asodium dodecyl sulfate 3aUnited States1 aStelzleni, Alexander M.1 aRincon, Angela G.1 aKumar, Sanjay1 aRigdon, Macc1 aMcKee, Robert W.1 aThippareddi, Harshavardhan0 tJournal of food protection.g2019 Mar., v. 82, no. 3 p.364-370dInternational Association of Milk, Food, and Environmental Sanitarians.wJournal:2024x0362-028X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-18-298  aDNAL 7aarticle02432naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002400145245008100169300001500250500002400265520151600289650002101805650001601826650002001842650001601862650001901878650001701897650001001914650001101924700002201935773009201957852000902049856004802058655001202106IND4418748620221122040501.0090403e200905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441874862DNAL7 a10.1007/s11258-008-9500-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAngelstein, Susanne10aLight acclimatisation of Elodea nuttallii grown under ambient DIC conditions  ap. 91-101.  aIncludes references  aLight acclimatisation capabilities of Elodea nuttallii at nearly ambient DIC conditions were investigated by determining growth characteristics, main photosynthetic parameters and pigmentation of plants incubated at 5 different irradiances (10-146 μmol photons m⁻² s⁻¹). Positive net growth was observed under all light treatments tested. Maximum ratio root versus shoot (r:s) of 1.86 was achieved at medium irradiances (72-94 μmol photons m⁻² s⁻¹), whereas at low (10 μmol photons m⁻² s⁻¹) and high irradiances (146 μmol photons m⁻² s⁻¹) r:s was significantly lower (0.39 and 1.05, respectively). With respect to main photosynthetic parameters, an increase of light compensation points (E c), attended by decreasing ratios of light saturation points of photosynthesis (E k)/irradiance were observed. E c values were comparable to other low-light adapted macrophytes, which indicate that E. nuttallii can be regarded as a low-light adapted plant, under photorespiratory conditions. This was also confirmed by maximum E k values of just 73 μmol photons m⁻² s⁻¹. Further support was achieved from pigmentation and non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) data, both indicating rather limited acclimatisation ability at light treatments above 90 μmol photons m⁻² s⁻¹. These results are discussed with respect to the competitive abilities of E. nuttallii under nearly ambient (photorespiratory) DIC conditions, especially in dense stands and turbid phytoplankton-dominated waters. 3aElodea nuttallii 3aacclimation 3alight intensity 3amacrophytes 3aphotosynthesis 3apigmentation 3aroots 3ashoots1 aSchubert, Hendrik0 tPlant ecology.g2009 May, v. 202, no. 1 p.91-101dSpringer Netherlandsx1385-02377nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11258-008-9500-4 7aarticle02742naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003500110040001800145100001600163245018700179300001200366500001500378520106600393650001801459650002501477650001801502650001801520650001601538650002101554650001501575650002201590650002301612650001401635650002401649650001701673650002401690650003201714650001801746650003301764650005001797650002301847650002601870651001001896651000901906653001001915700001401925700001901939773007901958852000902037856008502046930003302131945001302164946001102177655001202188IND2047636020221122032705.0950907e199501  enk||||jo|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204763602DNAL7 a77586232pmid7 a10.1080/026520395093742732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDe Luca, C.10aSimultaneous determination of sorbic acid, benzoic acid and parabens in foods: a new gas chromatography-mass spectrometry technique adopted in a survey on Italian foods and beverages  ap. 1-7.  a2019-12-04  aA gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric technique is described for the simultaneous determination of sorbates, benzoates and other lipophilic preservatives in foods and beverages. The selected ions monitoring (SIM) technique allowed unambiguous identification of the compounds under study. This methodology eliminated all kinds of interferences from the complex food matrices which affect most routinely-used techniques, HPLC included. A very simple and time-saving extraction procedure was therefore employed, since subsequent purification steps were unnecessary, even for detection of trace levels of preservatives. The detection limits fell within the range of 100-200 pg. With this analytical technique, we have conducted a survey on sorbic acid, benzoic acid, methyl, ethyl, and propyl 4-hydroxybenzoate levels in 249 samples of foods and beverages on sale in markets in the Rome area. Samples were chosen from among those currently preserved by these additives.

This leukopenic change of animals is reported as a characteristic feature in the best known human disorder: Alimentary Toxic Aleukia (ATA). The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether the haematologic disorders imputed to trichothecenes were a result of myelotoxicity by investigating in an in vitro model. Rat haematopoietic progenitors, Colony Forming Units-Granulocytes and Macrophages (CFU-GM), were cultured in the presence of several concentrations of four trichothecenes; T-2 toxin, HT-2 toxin, diacetoxyscirpenol (DAS) and deoxynivalenol (DON). All these trichothecenes were cytotoxic to rat haematopoietic progenitor cells. It is concluded that haematological disorders observed during trichothecene intoxication of animals are caused by the destruction of haematopoietic progenitors such as CFU-GM cells. 3aT-2 toxin 3aHT-2 toxin 3adiacetoxyscirpenol 3adeoxynivalenol 3agranulocytes 3amacrophages 3abone marrow 3acell culture 3atoxicity 3arats 3asoil aggregates 2aAnimals 2aCells, Cultured 2aHematopoietic Stem Cellsxdrug effects 2aMycotoxinsxtoxicity 2aRats 2aRats, Wistar 2aT-2 Toxinxanalogs & derivativesxtoxicity. 2aTrichothecenesxtoxicity1 aThouvenot, D.0 tFood additives & contaminants.g1995 , v. 12, no. 1 p.41-49x0265-203X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/026520395093742773Available from publisher's Web site  a19951002b19951006c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle02126naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003500110040001800145100001600163245012700179300001600306520065000322650001000972650001900982650002501001650001801026650002301044650002401067650002901091650002601120650002301146650004701169650002201216650001301238651001101251651001101262653002101273653001401294653001501308653001301323653002001336700001601356700001401372773008301386852000901469856008501478930003301563945001301596946001101609655001201620IND2046474020221122005350.0950616e199407  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204647402DNAL7 a79581172pmid7 a10.1080/026520394093742492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGilbert, J.12aA review of the research requirements for Europe to support legislation in the area of food contact materials and articles  ap. 497-518.  aA strong science base is required to underpin the planning and decision making process involved in determining future European Community legislation in the area of food contact materials and articles.

Results showed that both hypocotyls and stems from lignifying Z. elegans seedlings express a cell wall-located basic peroxidase of pl approximately 10.2, which was purified to homogeneity. Molecular mass determination under non-denaturing conditions showed an M(r) of about 43 000, similar to that of other plant peroxidases. The purified Z. elegans peroxidase showed absorption maxima at 403 (Soret band), and at 496-501 and 632-635 (alpha and beta absorption bands), indicating that this enzyme is a high spin ferric haem protein, belonging to the plant peroxidase superfamily, the prosthetic group being ferric protoporphyrin IX. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of this Z. elegans basic peroxidase was KVAVSPLS (peptide motif in bold), which shows strong homologies with the N-amino acid terminus of other strongly basic plant peroxidases. Isoenzyme and western blot analyses showed that this peroxidase isoenzyme is also expressed in trans-differentiating Z. elegans tracheary single-cell cultures. The results also showed that Z. elegans tracheary single-cell cultures not only express the same peroxidase isoenzyme as the Z. elegans lignifying xylem, but that this peroxidase isoenzyme acts as a marker of tracheary element differentiation in Z. elegans mesophyll single-cell cultures. From these results, it may be concluded that Z. elegans uses a single programme, i.e. an identical peroxidase isoenzyme complement, for lignification of the xylem, regardless of the existence of different ontogenesis pathways from either mesophyll cells (in the case of tracheary elements) or cambial derivatives (in the case of xylem vessels). 3aWestern blotting 3aZinnia violacea 3aabsorption 3aamino acid sequences 3acambium 3acell walls 3ahypocotyls 3alignification 3amesophyll 3amolecular weight 3aontogeny 3aperoxidase 3aprostheses 3aproteins 3aprotoporphyrin 3aseedlings 3aspinning 3astems 3axylem vessels1 aFernandez, M.D.1 aPomar, F.1 aPedreno, M.A.1 aBarcelo, A.R.0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2004 Feb., v. 55, no. 396 p.423-431dOxford University Pressx0022-09577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/erh0363Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02707naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001700154245012300171300001600294500001500310520132600325650002101651650000901672650001401681650002301695650001601718650002501734650001001759650000901769650001001778650000901788650001301797650001701810650001701827650002201844653001001866653001301876653002001889700001701909700001801926700001201944773009701956852000902053856009402062930003302156945001302189946001102202655001202213IND2059926920221121201352.0970926e199506  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205992692DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-277X.1995.tb00308.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParker, T.J.10aManagement of patients with food intolerance in irritable bowel syndrome: the development and use of an exclusion diet  ap. 159-166.  a2019-12-04  aFood intolerance is an important cause of abdominal symptoms. As no objective tests are available to identify the foods concerned, diets are essential for the management of these patients. The fewer foods allowed in the diet, the greater is the chance of success. Our original studies of 182 patients between 1979 and 1982, using a diet of lamb, rice and pears, had resulted in a 67% success rate. The foods most commonly involved were wheat (60%), cows' milk (44%) and corn (44%). A less restrictive exclusion diet was developed from the results of this work, avoiding all those foods to which 20% or more of the patients had been intolerant. Of 253 patients (79%), 200 were able to complete 2 weeks on this diet and 100 (50%) were successful in controlling their symptoms. The exclusion diet was modified in the light of this experience and in a subsequent study of 129 patients, 96 (75%) were able to comply for 2 weeks, but only 39 (41%) improved on the basic diet. However, examination of the food diaries of these patients enabled the identification of less frequent food intolerances in 21 (22%) giving an overall success rate of 60 (63%). In this way, equally good results can be obtained using a nutritionally adequate exclusion diet and avoiding the difficulties of following a more rigorous elimination regime. 3afood intolerance 3arice 3alamb meat 3apatient compliance 3afood groups 3anutritional adequacy 3awheat 3acorn 3apears 3amilk 3apatients 3afood records 3adiet therapy 3adisease diagnosis 0afoods 0asymptoms 0airritable colon1 aNaylor, S.J.1 aRiordan, A.M.1 aIvy Jo.0 tJournal of human nutrition and dietetics.g1995 June, v. 8, no. 3 p.159-166x0952-38717nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-277X.1995.tb00308.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a19971102b19971106c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle01901naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001500152245004300167300001600210500018100226520048500407650002300892650002400915650002700939650001500966650001300981650002300994650001501017650002501032653002601057653002001083653001301103653001901116653001301135653003101148653003301179773009701212852000901309856009201318930003301410945001301443946001101456655001201467IND2059876420221121170829.0970925e199610  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205987642DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1365-277X.1996.00469.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJudd, P.A.10aEducating the dietitians of the future  ap. 333-338.  aIn the special issue: Diamond Jubilee Conference Issue / edited by M.

These samples were drawn from 186 animal feed mills in the United Kingdom. Aflatoxin B1 was the mycotoxin found most frequently, occurring in most samples of rice bran, maize products, palm kernels and cottonseed, but in only 3 out of 20 samples of sunflower, in 1 out of 20 samples of soya and in no samples of peas, beans or manioc. Analytical difficulties were met with some combinations of commodity and mycotoxin and all results are uncorrected for recovery. The highest level was detected in a sample of maize gluten: 41 microgram/kg of aflatoxin B1 (47 microgram/kg total aflatoxins). Maize products also frequently contained fumonisins B1 and B2 at levels up to nearly 5000 microgram/kg in total and zearalenone up to a maximum level of 500 microgram/kg. Ochratoxin A and citrinin were found in approximately 20% of wheat and barley samples. One sample of barley contained ochratoxin A at a level of 102 microgram/kg and citrinin at a level of 8 microgram/kg. Low levels of ochratoxin A also occurred in a few samples of other ingredients: rice bran, palm kernel and beans. Sterigmatocystin at 18 microgram/kg was found in one sample of organically grown wheat and a trace amount of zearalenone in one sample of manioc. Multi-mycotoxin contamination also occurred, particularly in some samples of maize for which 19 out of 50 samples contained both aflatoxins and fumonisins. 3afeeds 3aaflatoxins 3aochratoxins 3acitrinin 3azearalenone 3afumonisins 3abarley 3awheat 3arice bran 3acorn 3acottonseed meal 3arapeseed meal 3asunflower meal 3apeas 3abeans 3asoybeans 3acassava 3acitrus pulp 3aolive pulp 3apalm kernel meal 2aAnimal Feedxanalysis 2aAnimals 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquid 2aFood Contamination 2aHordeumxchemistry 2aMycotoxinsxanalysis 2aOryzaxchemistry. 2aTriticumxchemistry 2aVegetablesxchemistry 2aZea maysxchemistry 3aUnited Kingdom 0acontamination1 aHetmanski, M.T.1 aChan, H.K.1 aCollins, S.0 tFood additives & contaminants.g1997 , v. 14, no. 2 p.157-173x0265-203X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/026520397093745113Available from publisher's Web site  a19980801b19980807c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle02332naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003500110040001800145100001300163245008700176300001600263500001500279520081600294650002101110650002301131650001501154650002101169650002101190650002001211650001201231650002101243650001001264650002301274650001801297650001901315650001901334650002101353650002401374650002801398650001001426650002901436650001901465651001001484653000901494653001101503700001501514700001501529773008301544852000901627856008501636930003301721945001301754946001101767655001201778IND2123557720221121170804.0980623e199702  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND212355772DNAL7 a91023462pmid7 a10.1080/026520397093745082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSola, S.10aEssential elements (Mn, Fe, Cu, Zn) in pork and duck liver paste produced in Spain  ap. 135-141.  a2019-12-04  aThe contents of four essential elements, Mn, Fe, Cu, Zn, were determined in 152 samples of pork and duck liver paste produced in Spain.

At the regulatory level for PSP toxins (800 micrograms kg-1), 39 of the samples were correctly determined by ELISA to be above or below this level, toxicity was overestimated in two samples, and underestimated in four samples. 3afood contamination 3afood analysis 3aanalytical methods 3atoxins 3afoodborne illness 2aAnimals 2aBiological Assay 2aBivalviaxchemistry 2aEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay 2aFood Contamination 2aMarine Toxinsxanalysis 2aMice 2aSaxitoxinxanalysis 2aSensitivity and Specificity 2aShellfishxanalysis 0acomparisons1 aDonald, M.1 aStraka, M.1 aMartlbauer, E.0 tFood additives & contaminants.g1997 , v. 14, no. 2 p.193-198x0265-203X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/026520397093745143Available from publisher's Web site  a19980801b19980807c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle03050naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001500152245007700167300001600244500001500260520149500275650001001770650002001780650001601800650001801816650002501834650001101859650002301870650002001893650001001913650002201923650002001945650001601965650002001981650001602001650002002017650002502037650002302062650002102085650000902106651001202115653002002127653002002147653000902167700001902176700001802195700001602213773009702229852000902326856009202335930003302427945001302460946001102473655001202484IND2059641320221121131720.0970914e199606  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205964132DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1365-277X.1996.00454.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYlonen, K.10aComposition of diet in relation to fat intake of children aged 1-7 years  ap. 207-218.  a2019-12-04  aVery little data are available on the diet of Finnish pre-school children from the last decade. In this study, food consumption data for 77 1-7-year-old Finnish children were collected by means of 3-day estimated food records. In the younger age group (<4 years), on average 15% of total energy was supplied by protein, 36% by fat, 49% by carbohydrates and 14% by sucrose. In the older age group (greater than or equal to 4 years), the proportions were 15%, 34%, 51% and 17%, respectively. Compared with the Nordic nutrition recommendations, the average proportions of fat and sucrose were too high and those of carbohydrate too low. Intakes of vitamins and minerals met or exceeded the recommended allowances, except for iron in the younger age group, and vitamin D in both age groups. Energy and nutrient intakes were compared among children with different proportions of fat in their diet (less than 30%, 30-34%, 35-39%, 40% or more of total energy). There was no difference in the energy intake per kg of body weight between the fat intake groups, and with respect to vitamin and mineral intakes the only differences were in the intakes of vitamin C and selenium. Only in the lowest fat intake group were the proportions of fat, saturated fatty acids and carbohydrates and the intake of cholesterol in accordance with or close to the recommendations. The results of this study support the growing evidence of the nutritional adequacy of a balanced, low-fat diet for pre-school children. 3afoods 3aschool children 3adietary fat 3aenergy intake 3adietary carbohydrate 3aheight 3apreschool children 3anutrient intake 3agirls 3aenergy metabolism 3adietary surveys 3abody weight 3abody mass index 3afood intake 3adietary protein 3anutritional adequacy 3agender differences 3adietary minerals 3aboys 3aFinland 0aage differences 0arelative weight 0adiet1 aVirtanen, S.M.1 aAla-Venna, E.1 aRasanen, L.0 tJournal of human nutrition and dietetics.g1996 June, v. 9, no. 3 p.207-218x0952-38717nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-277X.1996.00454.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a19971102b19971106c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle02104naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003500110040001800145100001500163245008600178300001200264500001500276520073800291650002301029650002101052650001901073650001001092650003401102650002301136650001301159650004101172650001101213650002501224650002901249650002601278651001601304651001001320653001601330700001401346700001401360700001401374773008301388852000901471856008501480930003301565945001301598946001101611655001201622IND2123580720221121131719.0980623e199701  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND212358072DNAL7 a90595762pmid7 a10.1080/026520397093744902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShim, W.B.10aNatural occurrence of trichothecenes and zearalenone in Korean and imported beers  ap. 1-5.  a2019-12-04  aIn order to survey the natural occurrence of Fusarium mycotoxins including deoxynivalenol (DON), nivalenol (NIV), and zearalenone (ZEN) in beers consumed in Korea, a total of 54 extracts of Korean and imported beers were derivatized with heptafluorobutyric anhydride and analysed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry with selected ion monitoring mode.

Compositional analysis  ap. 35-44.  aA survey 32 paper and board materials intended for food contact has been undertaken. Sample composition was analysed to identify chemicals with a potential to migrate to foods. Representative materials covering a range of uses such as aqueous and fatty foods, and use at ambient and elevated temperatures, were obtained from industry. The samples were examined in their unfinished state, even where the final form would have included lamination to plastics, printing, or other treatments. A comprehensive and systematic analytical approach was applied which included determination of volatiles by headspace GC-MS, extraction using water, ethanol and chloroform with subsequent analysis by GC-MS and HPLC, and multi-element screening by ICP-MS. The solvent extracts were also weighed to determine the total amount of material available for migration. A large number of volatile substances were identified with alkyl and aryl aldehydes predominating in the majority of samples. Substances identified in solvent extracts included 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxytoluene (BHT), di-tert-butylphenol, benzophenone, 4,4'-bis(dimethyl amino)benzophenone (Michler's ketone), triphenyl methane, bicyclohexylphenylphenanthrene carboxylic acid (and its methyl ester) and abietic acid. Levels of these substances were however generally below 1 mg/kg paper. Of the inorganic elements, arsenic and mercury were not detected above the limits of determination 1.8 and 0.4 mg/kg respectively in any of the 10 samples examined. Cadmium was detected in teabag tissue and in unbleached Kraft paper at 0.3 mg/kg. Chromium was present in seven samples at 1.1-7.8 mg/kg, whilst lead was present in nine of the 10 samples at levels ranging from 0.3 to 5.9 mg/kg. 3afood contamination 3afood packaging 3avolatile compounds 3ainorganic compounds 3aorganic compounds 3apackaging materials 2aBenzophenonesxanalysis 2aCarcinogensxanalysis 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquid 2aFood Contaminationxanalysis 2aFood Packaging 2aGas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry 2aHumans 2aKetonesxanalysis 2aPaper 2aSolventsxanalysis 2aTrace Elementsxanalysis 0acontaminants1 aOffen, C.P.1 aBaxter, M.J.1 aGilbert, J.0 tFood additives & contaminants.g1997 Jan., v. 14, no. 1 p.35-44x0265-203X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/026520397093744953Available from publisher's Web site  a19980801b19980807c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle03518naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003500110040001800145100002000163245013300183300001600316520184900332650001502181650001602196650001502212650001002227650002302237650002502260650004102285650001202326650002202338650001002360650003102370650002902401650004102430650002302471650001502494650003602509650002502545650002602570653001802596653001402614653001402628653001002642700002002652700001402672700001502686700001702701773008302718852000902801856008502810930003302895945001302928946001102941655001202952IND2123561620221121131701.0980623e199702  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND212356162DNAL7 a91023502pmid7 a10.1080/026520397093745122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aScudamore, K.A.10aDetermination of mycotoxins in pet foods sold for domestic pets and wild birds using linked-column immunoassay clean-up and HPLC  ap. 175-186.  aA technique referred to as 'linked-column immunoassay clean-up', was developed for the simultaneous determination of aflatoxins and ochratoxin A in a range of dry cereal-based pet foods and wild bird food. In addition a method also based on clean-up using immunoaffinity columns was used for the determination of fumonisin mycotoxins in samples known or suspected to contain maize. One hundred samples of pet foods consisting of 35 samples each of cereal-based dog and cat foods, 15 samples of domestic bird seeds and 15 samples of wild bird food were examined for aflatoxins B1, B2, G1 and G2 and ochratoxin A. Twenty samples of these samples were also examined for fumonisins B1 and B2. Limits of detection were about 0.5 microgram/kg for each aflatoxin and ochratoxin A and 3 and 8 microgram/kg for fumonisins B1 and B2 respectively. Eighty-four percent of the samples contained no measurable concentrations of mycotoxins. A low level of aflatoxin B1 was found in a sample of cat food and a concentration of 370 microgram/kg aflatoxin B1 in one sample of peanuts marketed for wild birds. Ochratoxin A was detected in 10% of samples but in low concentrations, the highest of 7 microgram/kg occurring in a sample of bird food. Fumonisins were found in 30% of the 20 samples tested with a maximum of 750 microgram/kg total fumonisins being found in a sample of cat food. Five samples each of dog and cat foods were examined for mould count and fungal species as received and after storage under controlled simulated damp conditions. Mould counts in all 10 samples examined were very low when received. The samples in which moisture content had been increased contained visible mould after storage. Penicillium, Eurotium and Aspergillus were the predominant species. However, no ochratoxin A or aflatoxins were detected in these spoiled samples. 3aaflatoxins 3aochratoxins 3afumonisins 3afeeds 3aanalytical methods 2aAflatoxinsxanalysis 2aAnimal Feedxanalysisxmicrobiology. 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Domestic 2aBirds 2aCarboxylic Acidsxanalysis 2aChromatography, Affinity 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquid 2aFood Contamination 2aFumonisins 2aFungixisolation & purification 2aMycotoxinsxanalysis 2aOchratoxinsxanalysis 0acontamination 0acat foods 0adog foods 0amolds1 aHetmanski, M.T.1 aNawaz, S.1 aNaylor, J.1 aRainbird, S.0 tFood additives & contaminants.g1997 , v. 14, no. 2 p.175-186x0265-203X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/026520397093745123Available from publisher's Web site  a19980801b19980807c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle03085naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003500110040001800145100001400163245007300177300001600250500001500266520131800281650000901599650001501608650001001623650001301633650002101646650001501667650001101682650001101693650001701704650001601721650001401737650001401751650002201765650001501787650001201802650000901814650002301823650001301846650002901859650004101888650002301929650001801952650002501970650002401995651001902019651001802038653001002056653001902066653001002085653001202095653001502107700001602122700002102138700001802159773008302177852000902260856008502269930003302354945001302387946001102400655001202411IND2123561920221121131710.0980623e199702  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND212356192DNAL7 a91023512pmid7 a10.1080/026520397093745132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPatel, S.10aSurveillance of fumonisins in UK maize-based foods and other cereals  ap. 187-191.  a2019-12-04  aA survey has been carried out to determine the levels of fumonisins in a variety of maize-based foods and cereals available in the UK. The fate of fumonisins during commercial processing of maize was also assessed at each stage of the process. Fumonisins were not detected in samples of barley, wheat, soya, oats, rice, corn syrup or oil, corn-on-the-cob, corn-fed chicken or wheat flour tortilla. Despite detectable fumonisin contamination in samples of the original maize, fumonisins were not detected in samples of the food products obtained from commercial maize processing. Low levels were detected in samples of tacos and in some foods containing corn-based thickeners, such as instant semolina pudding and instant custard powder. Approximately 78% of corn snack samples contained fumonisins (11-220 microgram/kg), while 24% of breakfast cereals contained total fumonisins at between 11 and 194 microgram/kg. Although none of the ready-made popcorn samples contained detectable levels of fumonisins, 46% of popping corn samples and microwaveable popcorn contained fumonisins at 14-784 microgram/kg. The highest levels of fumonisins were detected in samples of polenta with concentrations ranging from 16 to 2124 microgram/kg. Overall, fumonisins were detected in 26% (76) of the 291 retail samples analysed. 3arice 3aoccurrence 3awheat 3acorn oil 3afood composition 3acorn syrup 3abarley 3asnacks 3achicken meat 3ahen feeding 3atortillas 3asweetcorn 3abreakfast cereals 3athickeners 3apopcorn 3aoats 3afood contamination 3asoybeans 2aEdible Grainxchemistry. 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquid 2aFood Contamination 2aFood Handling 2aMycotoxinsxanalysis 2aZea maysxchemistry 3aUnited Kingdom 0aGreat Britain 0afoods 0agrain products 0atacos 0apolenta 0aenchiladas1 aHazel, C.M.1 aWinerton, A.G.M.1 aGleadle, A.E.0 tFood additives & contaminants.g1997 , v. 14, no. 2 p.187-191x0265-203X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/026520397093745133Available from publisher's Web site  a19980801b19980807c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle02791naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001300152245006200165300001600227520152000243650002401763650002601787650001901813650001601832650001501848650001001863650000801873650001001881650002301891650002501914653001801939653001401957653001401971653002201985653002202007700001502029700001802044700001602062773009702078852000902175856009202184930003302276945001302309946001102322655001202333IND2059383820221121102619.0970904e199604  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205938382DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1365-277X.1996.00443.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWise, A.14aThe structure and content of nutrition education messages  ap. 117-126.  aThe study was designed to investigate the response of people to nutritional messages written in different ways. For Experiment 1, positive and negative statements were constructed in which people were encouraged to 'eat' or 'avoid', with implicit or unstated alternative, or to 'eat and avoid' or 'avoid and eat'. In total there were 64 statements; each was followed by a brief reason for the action and this was constant for each food. To avoid bias and ensure that the eight foods appeared on each questionnaire in a different order every tune, the messages were set out in a Graeco-Latin square. Subjects were asked to rate the messages on a scale (1-7) for whether they were 'reasonable', 'practical' and 'compelling'. Additionally, for each message subjects were asked whether they already perform what is described in the message. The type of message construction appeared to be most important for the word 'compelling'. It appeared that messages with a single element (whether positive or negative) were less 'compelling' than those with two elements (positive and negative). For Experiment 2, 64 messages were written in which the first part was written as a command with a negative aspect followed by a positive one ('avoid and eat'). The reason given in support was classified in four ways and written in lay terms or using more technical words. It was concluded that messages including medical terms were most 'compelling' and that all messages were reduced in score when incorporating 'technical' terms. 3anutrition education 3anutrition information 3apublic opinion 3aterminology 3amotivation 3afoods 3amen 3awomen 3agender differences 3asocioeconomic status 0acommunication 0aresponses 0astructure 0apositive messages 0anegative messages1 aFarmer, L.1 aMackenzie, S.1 aMcLeish, A.0 tJournal of human nutrition and dietetics.g1996 Apr., v. 9, no. 2 p.117-126x0952-38717nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-277X.1996.00443.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a19971001b19971008c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle02131naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003500110040001800145100001300163245009000176300001600266520050200282650001900784650001700803650001900820650002300839650001400862650001700876650001100893650001300904650001000917650001600927650002800943650006400971650002401035650002401059650001401083650001801097650002001115650001601135650002401151650002901175650002401204650003001228650001501258650001601273650002101289700002101310773008301331852000901414856008501423930003301508945001301541946001101554655001201565IND2050545520221121070441.0960327e199507  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205054552DNAL7 a75897242pmid7 a10.1080/026520395093743492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLimm, W.10aEffects of temperature and mixing on polymer adjuvant migration to corn oil and water  ap. 609-624.  aThe effect of mixing on the migration of Irganox 1010 antioxidant from polypropylene and high-density polyethylene to water and corn oil was compared at 77, 100, and 135 degrees C.

The methods examined were those adopted in the Compendium of Food Additive Specifications (CFAS) by the Joint FAD-WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives, FAO, The Japanese Standards for Food Additives (JSFA) by the Ministry of Health and Welfare, Japan, and the Food Chemicals Codex (FCC) by the National Research Council, USA. The methods given in CFAS and JSFA are the same (potassium permanganate consumption). However, by this method, manganese(VII) in potassium permanganate was readily reduced to colourless manganese(II) with some substances contained in the propionic acid before reacting with aldehydes, which are generally considered as 'readily oxidizable substances', to form brown manganese(IV) oxide. The FCC method (bromine consumption) for 'ROS' could be recommended because it was able to obtain quantitative results of 'ROS', including aldehydes. 3apropionic acid 3afood additives 3aoxidation 3aanalytical methods 2aAldehydesxisolation & purification 2aFood Additivesxchemistry 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aPropionatesxchemistry 0acomparisons 0aros1 aTakeda, Y.1 aKawasaki, Y.1 aKubota, H.1 aYamada, T.0 tFood additives & contaminants.g1996 Jan., v. 13, no. 1 p.1-4x0265-203X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/026520396093743753Available from publisher's Web site  a19970602b19970606c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle02591naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003500110040001800145100001800163245013100181300001600312500001500328520092000343650001801263650002501281650002301306650001901329650001401348650001201362650001501374650001701389650001901406650001201425650001501437650001401452650003001466650002301496650001901519650004001538650000901578650005301587650004401640650002201684650001701706650002101723653001601744700001401760700001701774773008301791852000901874856008501883930003301968945001302001946001102014655001202025IND2050544620221121070421.0960327e199507  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205054462DNAL7 a75897202pmid7 a10.1080/026520395093743452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSauvant, M.P.10aChemical and in vitro toxicological evaluations of water packaged in polyvinyl chloride and polyethylene terephthalate bottles  ap. 567-584.  a2019-12-04  aThis study proposed a new strategy assessing the health risks of mineral water packaging and compared the chemical analytical techniques and some in vitro cytotoxicological assays for the study of PVC and PET materials at the main stages of the manufacturing process of bottles. These evaluations were carried out with food simulant (deionized-endotoxin-tested water) and with natural mineral water in real conditions of packaging and storage (from 0 to 24 months). The complementarity of these two approaches is discussed. Some analytical and cytotoxic abnormalities were detected in the food simulant after contact with the batches of powdered PVC compound, PET resin and their intermediate steps of transformation (PVC-'paraison', PET-'preform'). But these results did not reflect the actual behaviour of the finished PVC and PET bottles, for which no major abnormality was detected in the natural mineral water. 3afood analysis 3apoly(vinyl chloride) 3afood contamination 3afood packaging 3abioassays 3abottles 3aphthalates 3apolyethylene 3adrinking water 2aAnimals 2aCell Death 2aCell Line 2aFibroblastsxdrug effects 2aFood Contamination 2aFood Packaging 2aL-Lactate Dehydrogenasexmetabolism 2aMice 2aPolyethylene Terephthalatesxanalysisxtoxicity. 2aPolyvinyl Chloridexanalysisxtoxicity. 2aRNAxbiosynthesis 2aRisk Factors 2aWaterxchemistry 0amethodology1 aPepin, D.1 aBohatier, J.0 tFood additives & contaminants.g1995 , v. 12, no. 4 p.567-584x0265-203X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/026520395093743453Available from publisher's Web site  a19960331b19960404c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle02397naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003500110040001800145100001600163245004200179300001600221520113200237650001001369650001601379650001801395650001501413650002601428650002301454650001901477650002601496650002901522650008001551650002601631650003201657651001101689651001101700700001801711773008301729852000901812856008501821930003301906945001301939946001101952655001201963IND2050545020221121070425.0960327e199507  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205054502DNAL7 a75897222pmid7 a10.1080/026520395093743472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aScott, P.M.10aDetermination of ochratoxin A in beer  ap. 591-598.  aBecause of concern about possible transmission of ochratoxin A (OA) from contaminated grain adjuncts, development of a sensitive method for its determination in beer was investigated. Solid phase extraction (SPE) on C-18 and silica gel columns in series and on an immunoaffinity column (OchraTest) were used to obtain extracts for quantitation by reverse phase liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection. The standard curve was linear in the range 2.5-50 pg OA injected and detection limits for both methods were of the order 0.05-0.1 ng/ml beer (signal to noise 3:1). Per cent recovery of OA from various beer samples spiked at a level of 1 ng/ml averaged 82-100% for three modifications of the SPE method and 97% for the immunoaffinity column method. Forty-one samples of Canadian and imported beers were analysed. Trace levels of OA (less than or equal to 0.2 ng/ml) were detected in 26 samples by SPE and/or immunoaffinity column methods; there was generally good agreement between the methods. Identity of OA was confirmed by methyl ester formation in five samples cleaned up by the immunoaffinity column procedure. 3abeers 3aochratoxins 3afood analysis 3aextraction 3aliquid chromatography 3afood contamination 2aBeerxanalysis 2aCarcinogensxanalysis 2aChromatography, Affinity 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquidxmethodsxstatistics & numerical data. 2aOchratoxinsxanalysis 2aSensitivity and Specificity 3aCanada 0aCanada1 aKanhere, S.R.0 tFood additives & contaminants.g1995 , v. 12, no. 4 p.591-598x0265-203X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/026520395093743473Available from publisher's Web site  a19960331b19960404c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle02248naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003500110040001800145100001900163245012500182300001600307520083800323650001501161650002901176650002301205650002001228650000901248650003101257650007201288650002901360650003101389650002501420650004701445653001101492653001201503653001401515700001901529700002001548773008301568852000901651856008501660930003301745945001301778946001101791655001201802IND2050544820221121070431.0960327e199507  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205054482DNAL7 a75897212pmid7 a10.1080/026520395093743462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEl-Refai, I.M.10aEffects of some insect growth regulators on growth of Aspergillus flavus and its productivity of aflatoxin B1 and lipids  ap. 585-590.  aTwo insect growth regulators, namely CME 134 and Dowco 439, have been tested for their effect on growth and on aflatoxin B1 and lipid productivity in Aspergillus flavus. No effect on growth and lipid production was detected. However, various concentrations of CME 134 and Dowco 439 showed significant inhibitory effects on aflatoxin B1 production. The degree of inhibition was dependent on the concentration and time of application. Inhibition was observed when Dowco 439 was added at inoculation and again 3, 6, 9, 12 and 15 days after inoculation, as well as after the addition of either CME 134 or Dowco 439 to the individual cultures at inoculation and 3 days after inoculation. However, the addition of either CME 134 or Dowco 439 as late as 6 days after inoculation markedly decreased the inhibition of aflatoxin B1 production. 3aaflatoxins 3ainsect growth regulators 3aAspergillus flavus 3astored products 3acorn 2aAflatoxin B1xbiosynthesis 2aAspergillus flavusxdrug effectsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aBenzamidesxpharmacology 2aInsecticidesxpharmacology 2aLipidsxbiosynthesis 2aUreaxanalogs & derivativesxpharmacology. 0agrowth 0acme 134 0adowco 4391 aAwadalla, O.A.1 aAbou Zeid, A.M.0 tFood additives & contaminants.g1995 , v. 12, no. 4 p.585-590x0265-203X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/026520395093743463Available from publisher's Web site  a19960331b19960404c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle03128naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001400154245010700168300001400275520196400289650001702253650001502270650001302285650001302298650001002311650001002321650001602331651001102347653002002358653001102378700001702389700001902406700001402425700002402439773009502463852000902558856009402567930003302661945001302694946001102707655001202718IND2046426520221121070502.0950614e199502  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204642652DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-277X.1995.tb00296.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLucas, F.10aEstimation of foof portion size using photographs: validity, strengths, weaknesses and recommendations  ap. 65-74.  aPhotographs are valuable aids in the estimation of food portion sizes and are easy to use in dietary surveys. As with other methods, employing photographs to estimate portion sizes consumed produces errors due to the method itself and errors from other sources such as poor recall of amounts actually eaten. This study was aimed at the first type of error and investigated errors due to the visual perception of food portions from food photographs in the absence of recall biases. Two hundred and seventy women were presented with various amounts of foods and asked to indicate the portion sizes using appropriate sets of photographs. The photographs showed three portion sizes (small, medium, large) for each of 45 foods commonly found in the French diet. The portions of real food estimated by subjects were prepared to the same weights as the portions photographed. Estimates of portion sizes were compared to the weighed amounts. They were found to be accurate within 25% in most cases. Except for three foods, errors on estimates were seen for one or more portions per food. Two patterns of errors were identified. For 22 foods, the small portion sizes were overestimated and the large portion sizes underestimated, but no error occurred with the medium portion. For 20 other foods, the three portion sizes were either all underestimated or all overestimated. The first pattern of error may be due to a general tendency to avoid extreme response categories, while the second pattern of error may be related to biased visual perception. In general, there was no obvious way to link the patterns of errors with the type or physical appearance of the foods. In conclusion, the photograph method is recommended for the assessment of portion sizes, provided that great care is taken to suggest the volume of the food portions in the photographs and in selecting a range of portions which encompasses the range of amounts of food actually consumed in the diet. 3aportion size 3aestimation 3avalidity 3aaccuracy 3afoods 3awomen 3aphotographs 3aFrance 0acharacteristics 0aerrors1 aNiravong, M.1 aVilleminot, S.1 aKaaks, R.1 aClavel-Chapelon, F.0 tJournal of human nutrition and dietetics.g1995 Feb., v. 8, no. 1 p.65-74x0952-38717nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-277X.1995.tb00296.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a19950703b19950711c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle03614naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003300111040001800144100002100162245011100183300001600294520174400310650003902054650002102093650001302114650001702127650002002144650001602164650001702180650001602197650001902213650003502232650007702267650002502344650001502369650001002384650001002394650002102404650001102425650006302436650001802499650001102517650000902528650001602537650002002553650002602573650002202599650001502621650001602636651001302652700002102665700002202686773009602708852000902804856008302813930003302896945002502929946001102954990002302965655001202988IND4372668820221121061319.0050725e200401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437266882DNAL7 a146793752pmid7 a10.1038/sj.ejcn.16017562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJirathitikal, V.10aIncreased body weight and improved quality of life in AIDS patients following V-1 Immunitor administration  ap. 110-115.  aObjectives: Development of affordable and safe therapy to reverse the loss of body mass is of critical importance since AIDS-related wasting is associated with increased mortality. Method: We have demonstrated earlier that oral therapeutic HIV vaccine, V-1 Immunitor (V1), tested in a small group of AIDS patients in Thailand not only increases T-cell counts and decreases the viral load but also results in weight gain and prolonged survival. To further expand this observation, we retrospectively analyzed 650 HIV-positive patients who were followed for an average of 23 weeks. Results: The treatment with V1 resulted in a sustained and statistically significant increase in body mass across the whole population (mean+/-s.e.; 1.5+/-0.4 kg; P=6.5E-015). Among them, 384 (59%) patients gained an average of 4.2+/-0.2 kg; 107 (17%) had unchanged weight; and 159 (24%) had lost 3.8+/-0.3 kg. Thus, the prevailing majority of patients (76%) were able to gain or maintain weight. Treatment was well tolerated; in a survey of health status in a comparable but separate group of 382 patients, about 85% reported subjective improvement after V1 treatment, 6% reported no difference, and 9% of the patients reported minor adverse reactions, which did not last more than 1 week. Subjective improvement coincides with the reduction or clearance of oral thrush or mucocutaneous candidiasis in 87.5% of the patients. Conclusions: In an open label setting, V1 increases body weight, subjective assessment of quality of life, and is safe and effective for HIV patients with weight loss. These data provide the impetus of using V-1 Immunitor as an affordable and easy-to-administer means of treating AIDS-associated wasting and opportunistic infections. 3aacquired immunodeficiency syndrome 3awasting syndrome 3avaccines 3apatient care 3aquality of life 3aweight gain 3adiet therapy 3aweight loss 3aweight control 2aAIDS Vaccinesxtherapeutic use 2aAcquired Immunodeficiency Syndromexdrug therapyximmunologyxmortality. 2aAdministration, Oral 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aChild 2aChild, Preschool 2aFemale 2aHIV Wasting Syndromexdrug therapyximmunologyxmortality. 2aHealth Status 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aQuality of Life 2aRetrospective Studies 2aTreatment Outcome 2aViral Load 2aWeight Gain 3aThailand1 aMetadilogkul, O.1 aBourinbaiar, A.S.0 tEuropean journal of clinical nutrition.g2004 Jan., v. 58, no. 1 p.110-115x0954-30077nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sj.ejcn.16017563Available from publisher's Web site  a20110328b20110402c00000000  aINDdTEMePNN 2011/0  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle03563naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003300111040001800144072001700162072001700179100001500196245017000211300001600381500001500397520155500412650001701967650002301984650001302007650002602020650001602046650002702062650001102089650001602100650001002116650002502126650002702151650003302178650004302211650001102254650001102265650003502276650003002311650003102341650005002372651001502422651001502437653001802452653002502470653002102495700002002516700001702536700001602553700001402569700001602583700002302599773009502622852000902717856008302726930003302809945002502842946001102867990002302878655001202901IND4370992620221121050607.0050605e200505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437099262DNAL7 a157987762pmid7 a10.1038/sj.ejcn.16021222doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aAlam, D.S.10aValidity and reproducibility of resting metabolic rate measurements in rural Bangladeshi women: comparison of measurements obtained by Medgem and by Deltatrac device  ap. 651-657.  a2019-12-04  aObjective: To assess reproducibility and validity of resting metabolic rate (RMR) of Bangladeshi women as measured with the MedGem device and using the Deltatrac metabolic monitor as a reference; and (2) to evaluate the FAO/WHO/UNU basal metabolic rate (BMR)-prediction equations. Design: In each of two sessions, resting oxygen consumption was measured in triplicate by MedGem and in triplicate by Deltatrac device. Setting: Matlab area, the rural field research area of the Centre for Health and Population Research, Bangladesh (ICDDR,B). Subjects: A total of 37 nonpregnant, nonlactating women, aged 27.6+/-4.5 y, BMI 20.8+/-3.1 kg/m2 participated. Results: The difference in oxygen consumption by MedGem and Deltatrac device was significantly level dependent. Within-subject within-session variations (expressed as CV) were 9.0 and 3.0% (P<0.01) and within-subject between-session variations were 8.2 and 4.5% (P<0.01) for MedGem and Deltatrac, respectively. Mean RMR measured by Deltatrac (5.17+/-0.51 MJ/day) was not significantly different from the BMR predicted by the FAO/WHO/UNU equations (5.16+/-0.42 MJ/day) in the second session and only 0.19 MJ/day higher than predicted in the first session (P<0.05). Conclusion: Reproducibility and validity of the MedGem device was poor compared to the Deltatrac reference method. The FAO/WHO/UNU BMR-prediction equations give a good estimation of the BMR of rural, nonpregnant, nonlactating Bangladeshi women of 18-35 y.

Design: A randomized, double-blind, crossover study. Setting: University of Maastricht, the Netherlands. Subjects: A total of 10 healthy volunteers and 10 patients with type II diabetes. Interventions: Subjects received 200 kcal of four enteral nutrition products (two standard products and two diabetes-specific products). Fasting and postprandial plasma glucose were measured for 2 h. Peak glucose level and area under the curve were calculated. Results: In healthy volunteers and diabetic patients, the feed with a low carbohydrate (CHO), high monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) and high fibre content significantly decreased peak glucose concentration and area under the curve compared to the feeds with standard composition. Conclusions: Special feeds with a low CHO, high MUFA and high fibre content improve glycaemic balance and therefore should be considered in diabetic patients who are in need of nutritional support.

  1 aFerraz, I.S.10aDetection of vitamin A deficiency in Brazilian preschool children using the serum 30-day dose-response test  ap. 1372-1377.  aBackground: Vitamin A deficiency (VAD) is endemic in Brazil and health professionals have difficulty in recognizing its subclinical form. In addition, serum retinol concentrations do not always represent vitamin A status in the organism. Objective: To identify VAD in preschool children by the serum 30-day dose-response test (+S30DR) and to examine its potential as a tool for the assessment of vitamin A status in the community. Design: A prospective transverse study in which blood samples were obtained from 188 preschool children for the determination of serum retinol concentrations and the children were submitted to ocular inspection and anthropometric measurements. Information about the presence of diarrhea and/or fever during the 15 days preceding the study was also obtained. The children received an oral dose of 200,000 IU vitamin A immediately after the first blood collection. A second blood sample was obtained 30-45 days after supplementation in order to determine the +S30DR. Results: In all, 74.5% (140/188; 95% confidence interval: 68.3-80.7%) of the children presented +S30DR values indicative of low hepatic reserves. The mean serum retinol concentration was significantly lower before supplementation (0.92 and 1.65 micromol/l, respectively; P < 0.0001). No child presented xerophthalmia; 3.7% (7/188) of the children were malnourished. The presence of fever and/or diarrhea during the 15 days preceding the first blood collection did not affect the +S30DR value. Conclusions: The prevalence of VAD in the study group was elevated. +S30DR proved to be a good indicator of subclinical VAD in children from an underdeveloped country. 3avitamin A 3avitamin deficiencies 3adeficiency diseases 3ahuman diseases 3axerophthalmia 3apreschool children 3adose response 3anight blindness 3anutritional status 3ablood chemistry 3adisease diagnosis 3adietary supplements 3anutrient reserves 3adisease prevalence 2aAnthropometry 2aChild Nutrition Disordersxbloodxdiagnosisxepidemiology. 2aChild, Preschool 2aDietary Supplements 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMale 2aNutrition Assessment 2aNutritional Status 2aProspective Studies 2aSeroepidemiologic Studies 2aVitamin Axadministration & dosagexbloodxdiagnostic use. 2aVitamin A Deficiencyxbloodxdiagnosisxepidemiology. 3aBrazil 0aBrazilxepidemiology.1 aDaneluzzi, J.C.1 aVannucchi, H.1 aJordao, A.A.

Design: Cross-sectional study. Subjects: A total of 1701 children from 3rd to 7th grade in nine schools located in three geographical regions. Methods: We determined body mass index, food consumption (quantified FFQ which we categorised into five groups), PA in terms of TV viewing and frequency of after school PA. The data were analysed according to age, nutritional status and gender. A logistic regression analysis was performed using obesity as outcome. Results: Obesity was higher among boys; younger children presented higher prevalence in both genders. Daily intake of dairy products varied between 240 and 308g, fruits/vegetables, between 197 and 271 g, energy-dense foods between 343 and 460 g. In all, 22.3 and 47% of the children watched over 3 h of TV during the week and weekend, respectively. Older children watched significantly more TV during the week, while on weekends all children increased this time significantly. Boys were more active than girls after school. The logistic regression analysis showed a significant association between obesity and low intake of dairy products. Conclusions: Prevalence of obesity among Chilean children is high. Although TV time, intake of energy dense foods and fruits/vegetables appeared as risk factors for obesity, only dairy consumption was significantly associated with obesity. 3afood intake 3aenergy content 3aschool children 3anutritional status 3afood groups 3agirls 3aphysical activity 3achildhood obesity 3agender differences 3anutrition assessment 3afood choices 3abody mass index 3aboys 3afood frequency questionnaires 3achild nutrition 2aAdolescent 2aAge Factors 2aBody Mass Index 2aChild 2aCross-Sectional Studies 2aDairy Products 2aEnergy Intake 2aExercisexphysiology 2aFemale 2aFeeding Behavior. 2aFruit 2aHumans 2aLeisure Activities 2aLogistic Models 2aMale 2aNutritional Status 2aObesityxepidemiology 2aSex Factors 2aTelevision 2aVegetables 3aChile 0aChilexepidemiology. 0aeating habits1 aKain, J.1 aLera, L.1 aPizarro, F.1 aVio, F.1 aMoron, C.0 tEuropean journal of clinical nutrition.g2004 Sept., v. 58, no. 9 p.1278-1285x0954-30077nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sj.ejcn.16019623Available from publisher's Web site  a20110419b20110507c00000000  aINDdTEMePNN 2011/0  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02914naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245014900124300001600273520169400289650002101983650001002004650001602014650001302030650001102043650001602054650000902070650002302079650001002102650001002112650002002122650001202142650001402154650002402168650000902192700001402201700001302215700001602228773007602244852000902320856010502329939003302434946001302467655001202480IND4478504520221120231924.0140317e200206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447850452DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSahin, K.10aEffects of vitamins E and A supplementation on lipid peroxidation and concentration of some mineral in broilers reared under heat stress (32°C)  ap. 723-731.  aA study utilizing Cobb-500 male broilers was conducted to evaluate the effects of vitamin E (dl-α-tocopheryl-acetate), vitamin A (retinol), and their combination on their serum and liver concentrations of malondialdehyde (MDA) (an indicator of lipid peroxidation), iron (Fe) zinc (Zn), copper (Cu) and chromium (Cr) in broilers reared under heat stress (32°C). One day-old 120 broilers were randomly assigned to 4 treatment groups, 3 replicates of 10 birds each. The birds were fed either a control diet or a control diet supplemented with either vitamin A (15.000 IU retinol/kg diet), vitamin E (250 mg dl-α-tocopheryl-acetate/kg diet), or a combination of vitamins A and E (15.000 IU retinol plus 250 mg dl-α-tocopheryl-acetate/kg diet). Serum MDA levels were decreased in E, A and E+A groups (1.3, 1.5, and 0.95 nmol/ml, respectively) compared with control (2.1 nmol/ml) (P < 0.05). Similarly, liver MDA levels were decreased in treatment groups (3.6, 3.9 and 2.9 nmol/g, respectively) compared with control group (5.4 nmol/g) (P < 0.05). Supplemental vitamins E and A increased serum and liver concentrations of Fe, Zn and Cr (P < 0.01). Serum and liver copper concentrations, however, decreased (P < 0.05) upon vitamins E and A supplementation. In general, when a significant effect was found for a parameter, the magnitude of the responses to vitamin supplements was greatest with the combination of the vitamin A and vitamin E, rather than that of each vitamin supplement separately. Results of the present study conclude that supplementing with a combination of dietary vitamins E and A offers a good management practice for alleviating metabolic changes caused by heat stress. 3aalpha-tocopherol 3abirds 3ablood serum 3achromium 3acopper 3aheat stress 3airon 3alipid peroxidation 3aliver 3amales 3amalondialdehyde 3arearing 3avitamin A 3avitamin supplements 3azinc1 aSahin, N.1 aSari, M.1 aGursu, M.F.0 tNutrition research.g2002 June, v. 22, no. 6 p.723-731x0271-53177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.nrjournal.com/issues?issue_key=S0271-5317(00)X0086-33Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20140317  aOther US 7aarticle01978naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092040001800121100002000139245013100159300001600290520102500306650002101331650001101352650001901363653001701382653002001399700001601419773008201435852000901517856007901526930003301605945001301638946001301651655001201664IND2040980920221120221853.0940722e199404  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204098092DNAL7 a10.1093/ee/23.2.2482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcClellan, Q.C.10aInstar determination for the gypsy moth (Lepidoptera: Lymantriidae) based on the frequency distribution of head capsule widths  ap. 248-253.  aPrevious studies have investigated the use of head capsule widths from various insect species to describe the distributions of each instar. We present a unique method to classify instars of the gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar (L.), based on head capsule width. Our method uses nonlinear least squares parameter estimation to describe the distributions of each gypsy moth instar. Head capsule measurements from 3,903 field collected larvae were used to derive instar class ranges. Class boundaries were assigned at the point of distribution overlap between adjacent instars. Probabilities of misclassification were determined from probability distributions fitted to each instar. A final classification rule was developed that will provide managers with a tool for determining the phenological distribution of a gypsy moth population from field collected data. The distribution of field collected frass widths was also evaluated as a means for classifying instars and did not result in a useful instar classification method. 3aLymantria dispar 3alarvae 3ainsect control 0adistribution 0ahead dimensions1 aLogan, J.A.0 tEnvironmental entomology.g1994 Apr., v. 23, no. 2 p.248-253x0046-225X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ee/23.2.2483Available from publisher's Web site  a19940802b19940811c00000000  aINDdTLX  aOther US 7aarticle01913naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245011400165300001800279500002400297520085300321650002301174650001101197650002301208650001401231650001201245650001401257650001201271650001801283650002001301650001301321650002301334700001901357773011801376852000901494856004801503655001201551IND4429355820221120221859.0091127e200912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442935582DNAL7 a10.1007/s10722-009-9433-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJansky, Shelley14aThe introgression of 2× 1EBN Solanum species into the cultivated potato using Solanum verrucosum as a bridge  ap. 1107-1115.  aIncludes references  aWild diploid Solanum species with an endosperm balance number (EBN) of one are a rich source of disease resistance, pest resistance, and tuber quality traits.

Criteria are offered to distinguish soils according to the ratio between the clay in the B2 horizon and that in the A2 horizon, as well as according to the changes in the soil pH. Formation of gley under conditions of stagnant to percolative water regime is a necessary and sufficient cause for light-colored acid eluvial horizons to form in their profile. In the main properties of the solid phase (acidity, total chemical composition, and distribution of silt), gley solods are identical to soddy-podzolic and chernozem-like podzolic gley soils. 3aacidity 3achemical composition 3aclay 3ahydrology 3asilt 3asoil pH 3aSiberia1 aPakhomova, Ye.

Tomato and carrot pulp contained a higher percentage of all pesticide residues, except for mancozeb in tomatoes. Although there was a difference in the relative distribution of the pesticides between the commodities with greater amounts present in the pulp of tomatoes, the pesticides followed a similar trend in both. A relationship between the pulp/juice distribution and water solubility of the pesticide was apparent. Pesticides with the highest water solubility were present to a greater extent in the juice. An exception was noted in the case of diazinon and parathion, which were present in higher amounts in the pulp than their water solubility would suggest. The percent residue in the pulp ranged from 56.4 to 75.2% for carrots, and 49.7 to 95.4% for tomatoes. Residues in the juice prepared from washed commodities ranged from not detected to 0.83 microgram/g. Washing of the produce removed more residue from carrots than from tomatoes, but it did not affect the relative distribution of the residues. The behaviour and fate of the chemical varied with the pesticide as well as the crop. 3acarrots 3atomatoes 3acarrot juice 3atomato juice 3afungicide residues 3ainsecticide residues 3afood contamination 3ahome food preparation 3awashing 3awater 3asolubility 3acaptan 3acarbofuran 3acypermethrin 3adiazinon 3aendosulfan 3aiprodione 3amancozeb 3ametalaxyl 3aparathion 3aoccurrence 0adistribution 0avegetable pulps1 aRipley, B.D.1 aLeishman, P.D.1 aRitcey, G.M.1 aKakuda, Y.1 aStephenson, G.R.0 tFood additives & contaminants.g1998 Jan., v. 15, no. 1 p.61-71x0265-203X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/026520398093745993Available from publisher's Web site  a19981201b19981208c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle02241naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092040001800121100002000139245008500159300001600244520117200260650002001432650002501452650001501477650001701492650002301509650001901532650002401551651001201575700001701587700001601604700001801620773008201638852000901720856007901729930003301808945001301841946001301854655001201867IND2040988820221120131118.0940722e199404  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204098882DNAL7 a10.1093/ee/23.2.3542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaccollom, G.B.10aApple maggot (Diptera: Tephritidae) trap enhancement with washed bacterial cells  ap. 354-359.  aSix apple maggot, Rhagoletis pomonella (Walsh), trap designs were evaluated in both managed and abandoned orchards. On the basis of trap efficacy, a protocol was developed for a control strategy using the Ladd trap (red hemispheres on a yellow rectangle) baited with apple volatiles, for which captures on red were consistently greater than on yellow. In another study, washed bacterial cells (media washed from the culture, and cells suspended in distilled water) of Enterobacter agglomerans removed from adult apple maggot and placed onto Ladd traps had significantly greater captures than did traps with washed cells from a standard culture or with ammonium acetate. The control strategy using the same protocol was also evaluated using the Ladd trap baited with apple volatiles and washed bacterial cells. There was a significant increase in the capture of gravid females on yellow surfaces and no detectable injury from the apple maggot at harvest. Fruit treated weekly in the field with an antibiotic mixture of streptomycin and rifampicin significantly reduced fruit injury indicating that the bacterium may serve some essential nutritional or biological need. 3aMalus domestica 3aRhagoletis pomonella 3abait traps 3aEnterobacter 3avolatile compounds 3ainsect control 3aPantoea agglomerans 3aVermont1 aLauzon, C.R.1 aPayne, E.B.1 aCurrier, W.W.0 tEnvironmental entomology.g1994 Apr., v. 23, no. 2 p.354-359x0046-225X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ee/23.2.3543Available from publisher's Web site  a19940802b19940811c00000000  aINDdTLX  aOther US 7aarticle01573naa a2200337 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100002000115245007300135300001400208300002800222520064700250650001500897650002300912650001400935650001200949650002800961650002300989653002301012653001701035700001901052700001801071773007101089852000901160939003301169945000801202946001301210655001201223991610543040742620221120131052.0850904e198503  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI850077462DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSwaminathan, B.10aEnzyme immunoassays for Salmonella: One-day testing is now a reality  ap. 83-89.  ap. 83-89. ill., charts.  aRapid detection methods and enzyme immunoassays (EIA's) for Salmonella in foods are reviewed and discussed.

Antibiosis in lines PI137739 and PI262660 could not be detected statistically when the uninfected plants were analyzed separately. When data from only BYDV-infected plants were analyzed, Russian wheat aphid performance was significantly less on both PI137739 and PI262660 than on the susceptible varieties, indicating that plant stress influences expression of Russian wheat aphid antibiosis. Relative to uninfected controls, BYDV infection did not affect Russian wheat aphid performance on either susceptible wheat variety or the resistant line PI137739. In the resistant line PI262660, PAV, RPV, and SGV infection significantly reduced Russian wheat aphid performance. By contrast, PAV infection significantly increased aphid performance on 'Border' oats, but it was still far below performance on any other plant-virus combination. These results suggest that BYDV infection does influence Russian wheat aphid survival or fecundity, or both, on certain hosts even though the aphid is not a vector of the virus isolates used in this study. 3aTriticum aestivum 3aDiuraphis noxia 3apest resistance 3amortality 3afecundity 0abarley yellow dwarf luteovirus0 tEnvironmental entomology.g1994 Apr., v. 23, no. 2 p.326-330x0046-225X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ee/23.2.3263Available from publisher's Web site  a19940802b19940811c00000000  aINDdTLX  aOther US 7aarticle01710naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120100001800138245010900156300001400265520074200279650002101021650001101042650001001053650001201063650000801075650002001083650002601103700001701129773008001146852000901226856007801235930003301313945001301346946001301359655001201372IND2041103620221120115139.0940727e199402  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204110362DNAL7 a10.1093/ee/23.1.802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStewart, S.D.10aEffects of age, sex, and reproductive status on flight by the tarnished plant bug (Heteroptera: Miridae)  ap. 80-84.  aWe determined the frequency and duration of flight by tarnished plant bugs, Lygus lineolaris (Palisot de Beauvois), on flight mills.

The single-flight durations of young, parous females were longest. This information supports studies showing that early-reproductive females were more likely to colonize new habitat patches than were males or prereproductive females. 3aLygus lineolaris 3aflight 3amales 3afemales 3aage 3asexual behavior 3areproductive behavior1 aGaylor, M.J.0 tEnvironmental entomology.g1994 Feb., v. 23, no. 1 p.80-84x0046-225X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ee/23.1.803Available from publisher's Web site  a19940907b19940913c00000000  aINDdTLX  aOther US 7aarticle02696naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245009500124300001600219520144400235650003101679650001501710650001701725650000901742650001901751650002001770650001901790650001801809650002401827650001401851650001201865650001701877650002301894650000901917650002801926650001101954650001601965700001901981700001402000773007602014852000902090856010502099939003302204946001302237655001202250IND4478505820221120105338.0140317e200204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447850582DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLamas, O.10aT-helper lymphopenia and decreased mitogenic response in cafeteria diet-induced obese rats  ap. 497-506.  aObese individuals are more susceptible to infection than lean subjects. However, the underlying causes are not fully understood. To investigate whether obesity status influences immune response, we examined the immune function of diet-induced obese rats after 5 weeks of cafeteria feeding. Spleen lymphocyte subsets, blastogenic response to mitogens, phagocytosis, oxidative burst activity and the production of several cytokines by splenocytes were determined. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that spleen T helper cells were significantly reduced in obese rats without changes in T cytotoxic cells. Proliferative responses of splenocytes to LPS (lipopolysaccharide) and PHA (phytohaemagglutinin) from obese rats were significantly lower compared to their lean mates. Although no differences were found in phagocytic activity, a lower production of reactive oxygen metabolites (ROS) was noted in diet-induced obese animals as compared to lean rats. Finally, IL-2 production after mitogen addition was lower in cafeteria fed rats than in those receiving the control diet whereas IL-10 production tended to be higher in obese rats compared to lean animals. These results suggest that diet-induced obesity is accompanied by a reduction in the size of the T-helper pool, an impairment of splenocyte and monocyte responsiveness, decreased IL-2 and slightly increased IL-10 release by spleen, which may be related to potential health problems. 3aCD4-positive T-lymphocytes 3acafeterias 3acytotoxicity 3adiet 3aflow cytometry 3aimmune response 3ainterleukin-10 3ainterleukin-2 3alipopolysaccharides 3amonocytes 3aobesity 3aphagocytosis 3aphytohemagglutinin 3arats 3areactive oxygen species 3aspleen 3asplenocytes1 aMartinez, J.A.1 aMarti, A.0 tNutrition research.g2002 Apr., v. 22, no. 4 p.497-506x0271-53177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.nrjournal.com/issues?issue_key=S0271-5317(00)X0083-83Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20140317  aOther US 7aarticle02766naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092040001800121100001600139245014700155300001600302500001500318520162800333650002001961650001901981650002502000650001802025650003002043650001902073653002502092653001102117700001502128700002002143773008202163852000902245856007902254930003302333945001302366946001302379655001202392IND2040995320221120105423.0940722e199404  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204099532DNAL7 a10.1093/ee/23.2.4922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGross, H.R.10aDesign and application of a hive-mounted device that uses honey bees (Hymenoptera: Apidae) to disseminate Heliothis nuclear polyhedrosis virus  ap. 492-501.  a2019-12-04  aThe honey bee, Apis mellifera L., is a highly efficient forager on numerous flowering plants that host phytophagous insect pests. Because of these associations, honey bees theoretically provide an economical and nonintrusive means of conveying biorational mortality agents against pest species. This hypothesis was tested during April 1989 by employing a specially designed plexiglass and sheet metal applicator that causes honey bees to disseminate a talc formulation of Heliothis nuclear polyhedrosis virus (HNPV) into fields of crimson clover, Trifolium incarnatum L. The device when integrated into a specifically designed substructure of a conventional beehive provided separate entry and departure pathways for honey bees, which allowed bees to be surface-contaminated with the HNPV formulation as they exited the hive. The mean percentage of HNPV-induced mortality was significantly higher among Helicoverpa zea (Boddie) larvae that fed on clover heads from fields foraged by HNPV-contaminated A. mellifera and among Heliothis or Helicoverpa spp. larvae collected from those fields than among similarly exposed control larvae. HNPV in honey collected from treatment hives and stored at 26 +/ 1 degree C in total darkness remained active for at least 170 d. The extent to which the technology for using A. mellifera to disseminate insect pathogens is applicable for pest control will depend on an improved understanding of the interrelationships among A. mellifera, flowering plants on which they forage, targeted phytophages which reside on the plants, and the availability of pathogens which attack the phytophages. 3aHelicoverpa zea 3aApis mellifera 3aTrifolium incarnatum 3aBaculoviridae 3abiological control agents 3ainsect control 0aNucleopolyhedrovirus 0aspread1 aHamm, J.J.1 aCarpenter, J.E.0 tEnvironmental entomology.g1994 Apr., v. 23, no. 2 p.492-501x0046-225X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ee/23.2.4923Available from publisher's Web site  a19940802b19940811c00000000  aINDdTLX  aOther US 7aarticle03865naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001800164245011400182300001800296520211000314650002702424650002302451650001302474650002302487650001202510650001902522650001002541650001502551650001702566650002002583650001202603650002702615650003702642650002102679650004202700650006502742650003302807653002502840653001702865653001702882653001802899700002202917700002302939700001302962700002502975700001803000773015503018852000903173856008503182930003303267946001103300655001203311IND4443225720221120105412.0101001e201011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444322572DNAL7 a205090512pmid7 a10.1007/s11356-010-0339-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRaya, Akhila 10aEffects of rhamnolipids and shear on initial attachment of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 in glass flow chambers  ap. 1529-1538.  aBackground, aim, and scope Solid surfaces in contact with water have been found to be biofouled due to the attachment of various organisms. For better understanding of the biofilm formation, the important initial stage of bacterial attachment was investigated with Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 as a model microorganism. Effects of the biosurfactant rhamnolipids and the shear conditions were particularly examined. Materials and methods A highly reproducible procedure was employed. The procedure involved monitoring and counting the number of attached cells on glass walls of the flow chambers, through which a PAO1 suspension was circulated and, subsequently, a saline solution was passed for washing. The experiments were made under different circulation rates (exerting different shear on the bacteria) and rhamnolipid concentrations. Results and discussions Reproducibility of the procedure was confirmed. The velocity profiles near the flow chamber wall were determined. Rhamnolipids, even at a very low concentration of 13 mg/l, were found to deter the bacterial attachment substantially. Prewashing the cells with a 100 mg/l rhamnolipid solution, however, did not affect the attachment significantly. As for the effect of shear, the PAO1 attachment showed an increasing-then-decreasing trend in the range investigated, i.e., 1.0 to 26 mN/m² shear stresses at the chamber wall. The diffusion-limited transport of cells to the chamber wall might have contributed to, but could not fully explain, the increasing attachment observed in the very low shear range (up to 3.5-5.0 mN/m²). Conclusions As compared to static systems, the flow chamber systems significantly improved the reproducibility of initial attachment results. Flow chamber systems were more suitable for experimental investigations of bacterial attachment to surfaces. Rhamnolipids were found to be potent antifoulants for PAO1 attachment on glass. The initial cell attachment increased with increasing shear at the very low shear range (up to 3.5-5.0 mN/m²), but the attachment could be minimized with further increase of the shear. 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aantifouling agents 3abacteria 3abacterial adhesion 3abiofilm 3abiosurfactants 3aglass 3amonitoring 3arhamnolipids 3asodium chloride 3awashing 2aBiofilmsxdrug effects 2aBiofoulingxprevention & control 2aGlassxchemistry 2aGlycolipidsxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aPseudomonas aeruginosaxchemistryxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aShear Strengthxdrug effects 0aBacterial attachment 0aFlow chamber 0aRhamnolipids 0aShear effects1 aSodagari, Maysam 1 aPinzon, Neissa M. 1 aHe, Xin 1 aZhang Newby, Bi-min 1 aJu, Lu-Kwang 0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2010 Nov., v. 17, no. 9 p.1529-1538dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0944-13447nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-010-0339-63Available from publisher's Web site  a20101001b20101001c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01632naa a2200337 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001800115245010900133300001400242300002200256520067400278650001500952650001700967650001700984650001501001650002301016650002801039650002301067650000901090653002301099653002601122773007101148852000901219939003301228945000801261946001301269655001201282991610541390742620221120105421.0850904e198503  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI850077452DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAndrews, W.H.12aA Review of culture methods and their relation to rapid methods for the detection of Salmonella in foods  ap. 77-82.  ap. 77-82. charts.  aAnalytical methodology for the detection and measurement of Salmonella contamination in foods is reviewed and discussed, emphasizing aspects of conventional culture methods that will continue to be appropriate even if 1 or more of new rapid methods for this purpose (fluorescent antibody technique; enrichment serology technique) are adopted by industry and government regulatory agencies.

All three studies had similar results. The temperatures 15 and 18 degrees C appeared to enhance diapause development and subsequent diapause termination when compared with the lower temperatures (0-3 degrees C). However, the temperature range 9-12 degrees C was optimum for minimum mortality and maximum hatch at nearly all exposure times used. At this range and in particular 9 degrees C, hatch was as high as 60% after 180 d exposure. Exposures of 15 and 30 d produced minimal hatch, < 20%, at any temperature. Days to hatch tended to decrease as temperature increased but varied with experiment. Hatching time also decreased as exposure increased for all temperatures. Eggs exposed only to the developmental optima of 25 degrees C had < 20% hatch in all studies, and greater than or equal to 50% of the eggs were still in the diapause state at the conclusion of the studies. We concluded that most D. barberi embryos require low temperature to terminate diapause and complete embryogenesis. These studies support the hypothesis that D. barberi has a propensity to be continuously variable in diapause length. Also, variable diapause length has allowed this species to adapt to natural and artificial perturbations, in particular, crop rotation. 3aDiabrotica barberi 3aova 3atemperature 3adiapause 3aembryogenesis1 aJackson, J.J.1 aLew, A.C.0 tEnvironmental entomology.g1994 Apr., v. 23, no. 2 p.464-471x0046-225X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ee/23.2.4643Available from publisher's Web site  a19940802b19940811c00000000  aINDdTLX  aOther US 7aarticle02675naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024004200133040001800175100002100193245008800214300001800302500001500320520103400335650002001369650001801389650001201407650002001419650001801439650002401457650002801481650001101509650002201520650002301542650002601565650006901591650006701660651000901727653001101736653001801747653001201765700002401777700001901801700002201820700002201842773014801864852000902012856009202021930003302113946001102146655001202157IND4440903720221120094839.0100806e201009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444090372DNAL7 a205793182pmid7 aPMC34288592pmcid7 a10.1111/j.1365-3156.2010.02579.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJimenez, Juan A.10aDifferentiating Taenia eggs found in human stools: does Ziehl-Neelsen staining help  ap. 1077-1081.  a2019-12-04  aTo determine whether Ziehl-Neelsen staining can differentiate Taenia solium from Taenia saginata eggs. Tapeworm proglottids (33 specimens, 23 T. solium and 10 T. saginata) and eggs (31 specimens, 13 T. solium and 18 T. saginata) were stained. Four eggs from each sample were measured and average diameters were recorded. Taenia saginata eggs stained entirely magenta in seven of 13 cases. Taenia solium eggs stained entirely blue/purple in 4/18 cases and entirely magenta in one. Eggs of T. saginata were slightly larger and always ovoid, while T. solium eggs were smaller and mostly spheric. Ziehl-Neelsen staining can occasionally distinguish fully mature T. solium from T. saginata eggs, but this distinction is neither very sensitive nor completely specific. Differential staining suggests differences in embryophore components between species which become evident with egg maturation. In this small series, egg morphology (shape, maximal diameter) provided appropriate differentiation between T. solium and T. saginata eggs. 3aTaenia saginata 3aTaenia solium 2aAnimals 2aColoring Agents 2aDNA, Helminth 2aFecesxparasitology 2aHistological Techniques 2aHumans 2aLife Cycle Stages 2aParasite Egg Count 2aStaining and Labeling 2aTaenia saginataxgrowth & developmentxisolation & purification. 2aTaenia soliumxgrowth & developmentxisolation & purification. 3aPeru 0aTaenia 0aZiehl-Neelsen 0aCestoda1 aRodríguez, Silvia.1 aMoyano, Luz M.1 aCastillo, Yesenia1 aGarcia, Hector H.0 tTropical medicine & international health TM & IH.g2010 Sept., v. 15, no. 9 p.1077-1081dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1360-22767nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3156.2010.02579.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100806b20100903c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01436naa a2200313 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100002100115245007700136300001400213300002800227520059000255650001100845650001400856650001400870650002100884650002300905650001500928650002400943653000900967773007100976852000901047939003301056945000801089946001301097655001201110991610539610742620221120085041.0860314e198507  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI860098732DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBalulescu, Lano.10aAutomated ion-selective electrode method for salt determination in foods  ap. 38-40.  ap. 38-40. ill., charts.  aA computer-controlled automated method and analytical system is used for simultaneous determination of sodium (Na), potassium (K), and chloride (Cl) in foods.

Virus-exposed thrips were 1.4 times as likely to die than unexposed thrips in a given day. The reproductive potential for the virus-exposed group was significantly lower, and preoviposition period was extended. Development time from second instar to adult was 15% longer for thrips exposed to virus-infected plant tissue as larvae compared with the development time for thrips not exposed to the virus. 3areproduction 3aLobelia erinus 3aFrankliniella occidentalis 3aOrthotospovirus 3abiological development 3amortality 0aTospovirus1 aSether, D.M.1 aRossignol, P.A.0 tEnvironmental entomology.g1993 Dec., v. 22, no. 6 p.1308-1312x0046-225X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ee/22.6.13083Available from publisher's Web site  a19940603b19940609c00000000  aINDdTLX  aOther US 7aarticle02065naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001500164245009800179300001600277500002400293500001500317520082500332650001701157650001701174650001901191650001401210650001801224650002901242650002901271650003101300650002801331651001001359651001001369653002101379653002101400653001501421653002801436773012201464852000901586856004801595655001201643IND4423068220221120085142.0090710e200907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442306822DNAL7 a185971762pmid7 a10.1007/s10661-008-0411-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Hui13aAn assessment of heavy metals contributed by industry in urban atmosphere from Nanjing, China  ap. 451-458.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aMetals including major and trace elements were studied in total suspended particulates (TSP) in the atmosphere of Nanjing, China.

Individually caged onions were infested with 25 thrips per plant and inoculated 20 d later with A. porri (1,000 spores per ml of Onions were rated 6 and 7 d after inoculation. Plants infested with thrips and inoculated with A. porri developed more and larger lesions that coalesced as the plant matured. Older leaves were more susceptible to A. porri infection in the absence of thrips injury. Purple blotch infection shifted to younger leaves as a result of thrips injury to onion, and more tissue was killed by thrips in the presence of purple blotch. Plant growth was negatively correlated with thrips feeding injury. Scanning electron microscopy was used to determine morphological changes in leaf tissue resulting from thrips feeding injury and the development of purple blotch. In the absence of thrips injury, A. porri enters onion leaf tissue through stomates and directly through the epidermal cell layer. When both thrips injury and purple blotch are present, leaf tissue is extremely necrotic and A. porri appears to use areas of insect damage as alternative penetration sites. Thus, the feeding wounds caused by thrips enhance entry and development of the disease by providing alternative penetration sites for A. porri. 3aAllium cepa 3aThrips tabaci 3aAlternaria porri 3adisease transmission 3ascanning electron microscopy 0ainteractions1 aCartwright, B.1 aMiller, M.E.1 aEdelson, J.V.0 tEnvironmental entomology.g1993 Dec., v. 22, no. 6 p.1266-1277x0046-225X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ee/22.6.12663Available from publisher's Web site  a19940603b19940609c00000000  aINDdTLX  aOther US 7aarticle02854naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002600092040001800118100002000136245010900156300001600265500002400281520193800305650002902243650001402272650000902286650001502295650002202310650002502332651001402357700001902371773010202390852000902492856003902501655001202540IND4436425220221120072649.0100430e201005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443642522DNAL7 a10.1002/aqc.10932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSheaves, Marcus10aImplications of spatial variability of fish assemblages for monitoring of Australia's tropical estuaries  ap. 348-356.  aIncludes references  a1. Although often seen as ideal targets for monitoring environmental change because of their high public profile, fish assemblages rarely appear as indicators in monitoring and reporting.2. Published data were evaluated to develop a simple approach to quantifying the temporal consistency in assemblage structure suitable for routine monitoring and assessment. Data were examined as catch per unit effort (CPUE) and probability of encounter (PoE), and compared using three approaches with the potential to produce simple indices quantifying the patterns of similarity within an estuary over time: species richness, Bray-Curtis Similarities and a new approach, DeltaPoE. Indices derived from published data were then tested against a time series of data from two estuarine lakes with a history of fish kills.3. Multidimensional scaling based on PoE emphasizes the temporal consistency of fish assemblages within estuaries at least as well as one based on mean CPUE while providing operational advantages. Similarities based on PoE were more sensitive to change from 'natural' assemblage structure than the simpler indices and showed comparable results with Similarities from (log) CPUE data. The one drawback to Similarities is that their complex statistical formulation often makes them less effective vehicles for reporting and communication. Where this is the case the conceptual simplicity of DeltaPoE and its performance relative to Similarities suggests it is a good candidate from which to develop monitoring indices suitable for routine reporting.4. The performance of each of the indices were considered against the known fish kills. Species richness tracked the observed changes, an expected outcome in this case because a major impact directly removed species. Both indices based on Similarities also tracked the changes faithfully. Of the two, Similarities based on PoE seemed to react more strongly to assemblage changes. 3aenvironmental monitoring 3aestuaries 3afish 3afish kills 3aspecies diversity 3atime series analysis 3aAustralia1 aJohnston, Ross0 tAquatic conservation.g2010 May, v. 20, no. 3 p.348-356dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x1052-76137nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/aqc.1093 7aarticle02127naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002200110245017300132300001600305520097000321650003201291650002801323650001501351650000901366650001301375650001401388650002001402650001401422650001001436651001001446700002301456700002101479700001701500773007601517852000901593856010501602939003301707946001301740655001201753IND4478504120221120064621.0140317e200206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447850412DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShaikh, Saijuddin10aValidation of an anthropometric equation and bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) technique to measure body composition of children in India using D2O dilution method  ap. 685-694.  aTo validate two practical methods of body composition measurement, total body water percent (TBW) was measured using a) anthropometric equations, b) bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) and c) deuterium oxide (D2O) dilution (reference method) in 10 children (7 boys, 3 girls) from among urban poor in Kolkata, India (age : 8 m to 60 m, mean +/- SD = 29.0 +/- 18.82). The deuterium dilution (D2O) and the BIA method showed close concordance for estimation of TBW% (mean +/- SD of difference of paired values: 0.186 +/- 1.567, r = 0.81). Similarly, a close concordance between D2O and anthropometric method for TBW% (mean +/- SD of difference of paired values: 0.155 +/- 0.998, r = 0.93) was shown. Of the two methods, anthropometry appeared more accurate, useful and expedient than the BIA method, although the difference was not significant.

Two species of internal parasites, one of the larval stage, Bathyplectes anurus (Thomson) and one of the adult stage, Microctonus aethiopoides (Loan), were released in the largest numbers. A detection survey conducted by the USDA, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, found that a second larval parasite, Bathyplectes curculionis (Thomson), had already spread throughout alfalfa-growing areas in the United States. Later, an establishment survey successfully recovered parasites in nearly half of the > 700 counties where releases were made. Results from an evaluation survey indicated that the number of alfalfa weevil parasite species collected in surveyed fields in Iowa, Missouri, and Nebraska more then doubled from 1.3 to 3.0. Parasitism rates also increased in these states, whereas insecticide usage declined. However, < 3% of the 180 alfalfa fields sampled during the 8 yr evaluation survey reached the economic injury level. Both B. anurus and B. curculionis exhibited differential success when parasitizing two United States strains (eastern and western) of the alfalfa weevil. These two species parasitized an average of 21% of the larvae collected in survey samples. M. aethiopoides could possibly be an important method for keeping H. postica populations below economic injury levels. A delayed density-dependent relationship between this species and its host was demonstrated in three midwestern fields sampled for seven consecutive years. Before the first cutting of alfalfa, M. aethiopoides killed an average of 26% of adult weevils in the four areas surveyed in the eastern United States.

In the present study, we performed quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis for RSV resistance using 98 backcross inbred lines derived from the cross between the highly resistant variety, Kasalath, and the highly susceptible variety, Nipponbare. Under artificial inoculation in the greenhouse, two QTLs for RSV resistance, designated qSTV7 and qSTV11 KAS , were detected on chromosomes 7 and 11 respectively, whereas only one QTL was detected in the same location of chromosome 11 under natural inoculation in the field. The stability of qSTV11 KAS was validated using 39 established chromosome segment substitution lines. Fine mapping of qSTV11 KAS was carried out using 372 BC₃F₂:₃ recombinants and 399 BC₃F₃:₄ lines selected from 7,018 BC₃F₂ plants of the cross SL-234/Koshihikari. The qSTV11 KAS was localized to a 39.2 kb region containing seven annotated genes. The most likely candidate gene, LOC_Os11g30910, is predicted to encode a sulfotransferase domain-containing protein. The predicted protein encoded by the Kasalath allele differs from Nipponbare by a single amino acid substitution and the deletion of two amino acids within the sulfotransferase domain. Marker-resistance association analysis revealed that the markers L104-155 bp and R48-194 bp were highly correlated with RSV resistance in the 148 landrace varieties. These results provide a basis for the cloning of qSTV11 KAS , and the markers may be used for molecular breeding of RSV resistant rice varieties.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aRice stripe virus 3aamino acid substitution 3aamino acids 3abreeding 3achromosomes 3adisease resistance 3agenes 3agreenhouses 3ainbred lines 3aquantitative trait loci 3arice 3asubstitution lines 2aChromosome Mapping 2aCrosses, Genetic 2aDNA Primersxgenetics 2aGenetic Markersxgenetics 2aImmunity, Innatexgenetics 2aOryzaxgenetics. 2aPlant Diseasesxgeneticsxvirology. 2aQuantitative Trait Locixgenetics 2aTenuivirus 0aChina1 aWang, Qi1 aJiang, Ling1 aLiu, Ling-Long1 aWang, Baoxiang.1 aShen, Ying-Yue1 aCheng, Xia-Nian1 aWan, Jian-min0 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g2011 May, v. 122, no. 8 p.1591-1604dSpringer-Verlagx0040-57527nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00122-011-1557-0 7aarticle02120naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092040001800121100001600139245013100155300001600286520110000302650002201402650002701424650002201451650001601473650001301489650002301502651001101525700001701536773008201553852000901635856007901644930003301723945001301756946001301769655001201782IND2040981420221120033122.0940722e199404  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204098142DNAL7 a10.1093/ee/23.2.2922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrodeur, J.10aSeasonal ecology of Aphidius nigripes (Hymenoptera: Aphidiidae), a parasitoid of Macrosiphum euphorbiae (Homoptera: Aphididae)  ap. 292-298.  aAphidius nigripes Ashmead is the most common parasitoid attacking the potato aphid Macrosiphum euphorbiae (Thomas) in eastern North America. In field and insectary experiments, >87% of A. nigripes prepupae successfully overwintered. Spring emergence occurred from mid-April to mid-May, the period during which diapausing M. euphorbiae eggs are hatching on primary hosts. Data obtained from sticky traps indicate that both aphid and parasitoid enter the potato agroecosystem in early june, suggesting that one or several generations occur on primary host plants in the spring. The number of males captured in sticky traps containing virgin females indicated that the parasitoid is present in high numbers throughout the potato growing season. Diapause in A. nigripes was observed from mid-August, when aphids had migrated back to their primary host plants. Our results do not support the hypotheses that inability of the parasitoid to overwinter or host-parasitoid asyncrony explain why A. nigripes does not appear to have any major regulating effect on M. euphorbiae in the potato agroecosystem. 3aSolanum tuberosum 3aMacrosiphum euphorbiae 3aAphidius nigripes 3aparasitoids 3adiapause 3aseasonal variation 3aQuebec1 aMcNeil, J.N.0 tEnvironmental entomology.g1994 Apr., v. 23, no. 2 p.292-298x0046-225X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ee/23.2.2923Available from publisher's Web site  a19940802b19940811c00000000  aINDdTLX  aOther US 7aarticle03020naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245010700124300001600231520182300247650001602070650001102086650001302097650001602110650002702126650000902153650001802162650002302180650001002203650002802213650001002241650001502251650001402266650000902280650004402289650001402333700001502347773007602362852000902438856010502447939003302552946001302585655001202598IND4478505420221120033113.0140317e200204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447850542DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, Yi-Fa10aInfluence of dietary fat saturation on lipid peroxidation of serum and low density lipoprotein in rats  ap. 463-472.  aThe purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of different P/S (polyunsaturated/saturated) ratios on lipid peroxidation of plasma, liver and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) in rats, using dietary fats with different saturation levels. Male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing about 300 g were randomly divided into five groups and fed a semisynthetic diet containing 10% (w/w) fat for 6 weeks. The fat was composed of 100, 75, 50, 25, 0% corn oil and 0, 25, 50, 75, 100% lard (CO100, CO75, CO50, CO25 and LA groups, with P/S ratios of 3.81, 2.13, 1.21, 0.64, and 0.28, respectively) respectively. The body and liver weight of rats fed dietary fat with different P/S ratios were comparable among 5 groups. The CO100 group had higher plasma TBARS (thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances) than the CO25 and LA groups. The TBARS of LDL in LA and CO25 groups were lower than those of the other (CO100, CO75 and CO50) groups. In addition, the rats fed P/S ratio ≦1.21 (i.e., CO50, CO25, and LA groups) had lower LDL TBARS than rats fed P/S ratio >1.21 (i.e., CO100 and CO75 groups) when LDL were incubated with Cu2+ at 37 °C for 2 or 5 h. On the other hand, rats fed diets with P/S ratio ≦1.21 experienced significantly increase lag time of conjugated diene formation in LDL than those fed P/S >1.21. The fatty acid content of 18:2 (n-6) in LDL was reduced by decreasing the ratio of P/S in dietary fat. The ratio of linoleic acid content to oleic acid content was inversely correlated with the lag time of LDL oxidation. However, different P/S ratio in the diet did not affect 18:1 (n - 9), vitamin E levels and the TBARS values in liver of rats. The results suggested that P/S ratios in the diet influenced the LDL oxidation, and the lipid peroxidation might have a threshold of P/S ratios between 1.21 and 0.64. 3ablood serum 3acopper 3acorn oil 3adietary fat 3afatty acid composition 3alard 3alinoleic acid 3alipid peroxidation 3aliver 3alow density lipoprotein 3amales 3aoleic acid 3aoxidation 3arats 3athiobarbituric acid-reactive substances 3avitamin E1 aLu, Shuwen0 tNutrition research.g2002 Apr., v. 22, no. 4 p.463-472x0271-53177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.nrjournal.com/issues?issue_key=S0271-5317(00)X0083-83Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20140317  aOther US 7aarticle03371naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002100171245007400192300001600266500002400282520143900306650003101745650001501776650001001791650004401801650001201845650004301857650002601900650001501926650002501941650001101966650001801977650001701995650001302012650002002025650001502045650001702060650002002077650001902097650003002116650005802146650001402204650001602218650001002234650002102244650001902265650001402284650004502298650001302343650002702356650002302383651002502406651002502431700002102456700002102477700001802498700001902516773011002535852000902645856005502654655001202709IND4433198920221120023500.0100228e201003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443319892DNAL7 a199195352pmid7 a10.1111/j.1462-2920.2009.02095.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKohls, Katharina10aHalotaxis of cyanobacteria in an intertidal hypersaline microbial mat  ap. 567-575.  aIncludes references  aAn intertidal hypersaline cyanobacterial mat from Abu Dhabi (United Arab Emirates) exhibited a reversible change in its surface colour within several hours upon changes in salinity of the overlying water. The mat surface was orange-reddish at salinities above 15% and turned dark green at lower salinities. We investigated this phenomenon using a polyphasic approach that included denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, microscopy, high-performance liquid chromatography, hyperspectral imaging, absorption spectroscopy, oxygen microsensor measurements and modelling of salinity dynamics. Filaments of Microcoleus chthonoplastes, identified based on 16S rRNA sequencing and morphology, were found to migrate up and down when salinity was decreased below or increased above 15%, respectively, causing the colour change of the mat uppermost layer. Migration occurred in light and in the dark, and could be induced by different salts, not only NaCl. The influence of salinity-dependent and independent physico-chemical parameters, such as water activity, oxygen solubility, H₂S, gravity and light, was excluded, indicating that the observed migration was due to a direct response to salt stress. We propose to term this salinity-driven cyanobacterial migration as 'halotaxis', a process that might play a vital role in the survival of cyanobacteria in environments exposed to continuous salinity fluctuations such as intertidal flats. 3aMicrocoleus chthonoplastes 3aabsorption 3acolor 3adenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis 3agravity 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahyperspectral imagery 3amicroscopy 3anucleotide sequences 3aoxygen 3aribosomal RNA 3asaline water 3asalinity 3asodium chloride 3asolubility 3aspectroscopy 3astress response 3awater activity 2aCell Movementxphysiology 2aCyanobacteriaxchemistryxclassificationxphysiology. 2aEcosystem 2aEnvironment 2aLight 2aOxygenxanalysis 2aPhotosynthesis 2aPhylogeny 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 16Sxanalysisxgenetics. 2aSalinity 2aSeawaterxmicrobiology 2aWater Microbiology 3aUnited Arab Emirates 0aUnited Arab Emirates1 aAbed, Raeid M.M.1 aPolerecky, Lubos1 aWeber, Miriam1 aDe Beer, Dirk.0 tEnvironmental microbiology.g2010 Mar., v. 12, no. 3 p.567-575dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1462-29127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1462-2920.2009.02095.x 7aarticle01243naa a2200265 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100002000115245007100135300001600206300002400222520050300246650002300749650002000772650001500792653002100807773007400828852000900902939003300911945000800944946001300952655001200965991610531600742620221117172157.0860520e198511  xx ||||go|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI860103312DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRutenbeck, S.K.10aInitiating and in-plant quality control/sensory evaluation program  ap. 124-126.  ap. 124-126. charts.  aGuidelines for developing and establishing an in-plant quality control (QC) and sensory evaluation program for food producing companies are described.

However, this supposition appears to conflict with disturbance history research, which shows that wildfire was an important component of pre-settlement forest ecosystems. To better quantify historical forest patterns, a spatial simulation model of wildfire and forest succession was used to simulate pre-settlement landscape dynamics in the Oregon Coast Range, U.S.A. The model was parameterized to simulate fire regimes over 1000 years prior to Euro-American settlement using data from paleoecological, dendroecological, and historical sources. A simple fire-spread algorithm produced mosaics of variable fire severity and allowed simulated fires to be calibrated to match the shapes of real fires. The simulated landscape was spatially heterogeneous and highly dynamic. Old growth was the dominant patch type occupying a median of 42% of the total area. The relatively long fire return intervals, highly skewed fire size distributions, and mixed severities characteristic of the historical fire regime generated a landscape mosaic with large (> 100000 ha) patches of old-growth forest, although smaller patches (< 100 ha) were the most numerically abundant. Both small and large patches of old forest have important ecological roles in a dynamic ecosystem, and future landscape management efforts should consider the implications of altering these historical patterns. 3ahistory 3asimulation models 3awildland fire management 3alandscapes 3aecological succession 3aspatial variation 3acoasts 3adisturbed soils 3aforest ecology 3aforests 3aOregon 0apatterns 0avegetation0 tCanadian journal of forest research =.g2002 Aug., v. 32, no. 8 p.1316-1328x0045-50677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/x02-0543Available from publisher's Web site  a20030602b20030603c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02197naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100006100188245011100249300001400360506007600374520081300450592002801263506003701291650002201328650001601350650001401366650003901380650001301419650001801432650001301450650003001463650001501493700002501508700002301533700002701556700002101583773008101604856008101685852000901766655001201775IND60625301220221207073106.0200110s2019    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062530122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mex.2018.11.0152doi7 aPMC63082472pmcid7 a305960262pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcCoy, Patrick J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9412-110X10aPreparation of fluorescent in situ hybridisation probes without the need for optimisation of fragmentation  ap. 22-34.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aDNA-fluorescence in situ hybridisation (DNA-FISH) allows visualisation of chromosome organisation and rearrangement. FISH probes are pools of short fluorescently labelled DNA fragments that are often produced from template plasmids that contain large genomic inserts. For effective sample penetration and target hybridisation it is critical that probe fragments are between 200 and 500bp. Production of these short probes requires significant optimisation and can be confounded access to expensive sonication equipment or inherent sequence features that influence enzymatic fragmentation or amplification. Here we demonstrate that effective FISH probes can be prepared without the need for optimisation of fragmentation using a cocktail of two the 4bp recognition sequence restriction enzymes CviQI and AluI.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA fragmentation 3achromosomes 3aequipment 3afluorescence in situ hybridization 3agenomics 3ahybridization 3aplasmids 3arestriction endonucleases 3asonication1 aCostello, Anthony J.1 aCorcoran, Niall M.1 aHovens, Christopher M.1 aClarkson, M.

GPGMH or OVS protocols were used to synchronize nulliparous (n = 128; GPGMH = 94, OVS = 34) and multiparous (n = 154; GPGMH = 122, OVS = 32) buffaloes during the peak (n = 186; GPGMH = 143, OVS = 43) and low breeding (n = 96; GPGMH = 73, OVS = 23) seasons. Buffaloes were monitored for follicular dynamics, estrus response, ovulation, and pregnancy rates. The results showed that protocol, parity, and season had significant effects on estrus, ovulation, and pregnancy variables, and interactions among parity and protocol, season and protocol, and season and parity were observed for few of reproductive indices in the crossbred buffaloes. There were no significant (p > 0.05) interaction for protocol, parity and season. In multiparous buffaloes, the application of the GPGMH protocol significantly (p < 0.05) increased the interaction to the interval to estrus onset after the second GnRH, estrus response, ovulation rate, and pregnancy rate, and lowered (p < 0.05) the silent estrus when compared with the conventional OVS protocol. During the peak breeding season, the application of the GPGMH protocol significantly (p < 0.05) improved the interaction to the estrus response, ovulation rate, and pregnancy rate, while it lowered (p < 0.05) the silent estrus incidence when compared to the conventional OVS protocol. In conclusion, the GPGMH protocol, in comparison to the OVS protocol, improves the follicular dynamics, estrus response, ovulation, and pregnancy rates in crossbred multiparous buffaloes during the peak breeding seasons.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrossbreds 3aestrus 3aovulation 3apregnancy rate 3ariparian areas 3aswamps1 aNaseer, Zahid 1 aAhmad, Zulfiqar,1 aWang, Dong 1 aHua, Guohua 1 aYang, Liguo 0 tAnimals.g2022 Feb. 09, v. 12, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani120404153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02633naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132100002200150245008300172300001600255520121700271592002801488650000801516650001701524650001901541650001301560650001201573650001101585650001301596650001801609650001701627650001301644650001501657650001701672650003001689650001201719650001001731650002301741650001001764650002001774650001201794650001701806650001301823700001701836700001801853700002001871773014101891856008602032852000902118655001202127IND4533488120221119164738.0200511e20150101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND453348812DNAL7 a10.1080/14620316.2015.115132052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAntanaviciute, L.13aAn inexpensive and rapid genomic DNA extraction protocol for rosaceous species  ap. 427-432.  aThe development of high-throughput DNA genotyping, as part of marker-assisted selection and other DNA-based applications, has led to the need for a cheap, rapid and simple method for extracting genomic DNA (gDNA) from plant material. Commonly available gDNA extraction protocols do not provide consistently good quality gDNA from a wide range of plant species, particularly those in families such as the Rosaceae, which contain variable concentrations of polysaccharides and phenolic compounds. Furthermore, although commercial DNA extraction kits are widely available, they are expensive for the preparation of large numbers of DNA samples. Here, we present an improved gDNA extraction method which we have tested on 12 different species from the family Rosaceae: apple, apricot, blackberry, strawberry, peach, sweet cherry, sour cherry, pear, plum, red raspberry, quince, and almond. The method employs a novel lysis buffer which is a crucial step in obtaining high quality gDNA. It does not require expensive or toxic reagents and can be performed in the open laboratory, rather than in an air-flow hood. The method is reliable and produces good quality DNA that can be used in a variety of DNA-based studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aPrunus avium 3aPrunus cerasus 3aair flow 3aalmonds 3aapples 3aapricots 3abiotechnology 3ablackberries 3acherries 3agenotyping 3ahorticulture 3amarker-assisted selection 3apeaches 3apears 3aphenolic compounds 3aplums 3apolysaccharides 3aquinces 3astrawberries 3atoxicity1 aHarrison, N.1 aBattey, N.

Regional climate, land use and cover, and field management practice have massively changed since the 1980s in mollisol region in Northeast China, however, the dynamics of topsoil and profile SOC stocks and their distribution have not updated. To explore the dynamics of SOC stocks and their horizontal and vertical distributions in the 1980s–2010s, we took the mollisol region in Northeast China as an example location to conduct profile-scale soil surveys. The in situ surveys indicated that the topsoil SOC stock (0–20 cm) remained relatively stable throughout the 1980s, 2000s, and 2010s, and was 57.3 ± 5.5, 58.2 ± 3.3, and 57.4 ± 4.4 t C ha⁻¹, respectively. The average profile SOC stock (1 m) increased from 148.9 ± 18.5 t C ha⁻¹ in the 1980s to 162.0 ± 14.0 t C ha⁻¹ in the 2010s. A slowdown in land reclamation and implementation of conservation tillage helped maintain and restore SOC stocks. Although the overall SOC stock tended to accumulate, the study area suffered an increasingly unbalanced redistribution of SOC related to severe soil erosion. Soil particles and SOC at erosional positions such as backslope were stripped from the soil surface, leading to attenuated soil thickness and SOC stock; SOC-rich sediment accumulated and was buried at depositional positions, especially at the foot-slope, increasing the soil thickness and SOC stock. These results confirmed that not only the total SOC stock, but also changes in SOC spatial distribution deserve great attention. This study provides a platform to examine and modify the simulation effectiveness of carbon-cycling models, as well as solid foundations for optimal global mollisols management.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMollisols 3aclimate 3aconservation tillage 3aenvironment 3afood security 3aland restoration 3aland use 3asediments 3asoil depth 3asoil erosion 3asoil organic carbon 3atopsoil 3aChina 0aCarbon stocks 0aBlack soil 0aNortheast China1 aWang, Zhiqiang1 aHeinonsalo, Jussi1 aZhang, Yuanxia1 aLiu, Gang0 tScience of the total environment.g2022 Feb. 10, v. 807 p.150910-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1509103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02727naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245009100157300001600248500002000264520137600284592002801660650001201688650001801700650001601718650002001734650001001754650002201764650003401786650001301820650001401833650001801847650001201865650004301877650002801920650001001948650002301958700002401981700001802005700001602023700002202039700001702061773009702078856007302175852000902248655001202257IND60586339020221121134552.0171119e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058633902DNAL7 a10.1111/age.126202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBallester, M.10aAssociation of genetic variants and expression levels of porcine FABP4 and FABP5 genes  ap. 660-668.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe FABP4 and FABP5 genes, coding for fatty acid transport proteins, have long been studied as positional candidate genes for SSC4 QTL affecting fat deposition and composition traits in pigs. Polymorphisms in these genes, FABP4:g.2634_2635insC and FABP5:g.3000T>G, have previously been associated with fatness traits in an Iberian by Landrace cross (IBMAP). The aim of the present work was to evaluate the functional implication of these genetic variants. For this purpose, FABP4 and FABP5 mRNA expression levels in 114 BC1_LD animals (25% Iberian × 75% Landrace) were analyzed using real‐time quantitative PCR in backfat and muscle. FABP4 gene expression in backfat, but not in muscle, was associated with FABP4:g.2634_2635insC. In contrast, FABP5:g.3000T>G was not associated with gene expression levels. An expression‐based genome‐wide association study highlighted the FABP4:g.2634_2635insC polymorphism as the polymorphism most associated with FABP4 gene expression in backfat. Furthermore, other genomic regions associated in trans with the mRNA expression of FABP4 in backfat and FABP5 in muscle were also identified. Finally, two putative transcription binding sites for PPARG and NR4A2 may be affected by the FABP4:g.2634_2635insC polymorphism, modifying FABP4 gene expression.

Directly, in vitro-generated red blood cells (RBCs) may close the gap between blood supply obtained through blood donation and high demand for therapeutic uses. In addition, the cells obtained can be used as a model for haematologic disorders to allow the study of their pathophysiology and novel treatment discovery. For those reasons, a number of RBC culture systems have been established and shown to be successful; however, the cost of each millilitre of packed RBC is still extremely high. In order to reduce the cost, we aim to see if we can reduce the number of factors used in the existing culture system. In this study, we examined how well haematopoietic stem cells proliferate and differentiate into mature red blood cells with modified culture system.•Absence of extra heparin or insulin or both from the erythroid differentiation media did not affect haematopoietic stem cell proliferation and differentiation.Therefore, we show that the cost and complexity of erythroid culture can be reduced, which may improve the feasibility of in vitro generation of red blood cells.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acell proliferation 3aerythrocytes 3ahematopoietic stem cells 3aheparin 3ainsulin 3amodels 3apathophysiology 3atherapeutics1 aMetheetrairut, Chanatip1 aNugoolsuksiri, Sutthinee1 aFrayne, Jan1 aTrakarnsanga, Kongtana0 tMethodsX.g2018, v. 5 p.1626-1632dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23402x2215-01617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mex.2018.11.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02564naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245007000168300001800238520143600256592002801692650001301720650001701733650001301750650001201763650001401775650001401789653003301803653001001836653001301846653002101859653002201880653001701902653001001919700001501929700001601944700001501960773008601975856008402061852000902145655001202154IND60556592520221120214752.0161102e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055659252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.powtec.2016.08.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJafar, R.H.M.10aDust reduction in abrasive jet micro-machining using liquid films  ap. 1270-1274.  aAbrasive jet micro-machining (AJM) uses a high-velocity particle jet to erode features in target substrates for a variety of applications, including micro-electro-mechanical and micro-fluidic device fabrication. AJM can result in a dusty environment due primarily to airborne, rebounding abrasive particles that eventually settle. This paper proposes a novel concept of covering the target with a layer of liquid in order to improve the process cleanliness. Films of water, glycerin, and a polymer solution were used to investigate the effect of liquid viscosity and film thickness on the percentage of captured particles, and also on the depth, width, erosion rate, roughness, and waviness of abrasive jet micro-machined channels.The glycerin film captured up to 61% of the rebounding particles during the machining of micro-channels. The channel depth, width, erosion rate, and roughness decreased, and the channel centreline waviness increased. Films of the long-chain polymer solution and of pure water absorbed up to 42% and 36%, respectively, of the rebounding particles, while not significantly changing the channel depth, width, roughness, and waviness. For all liquids, the percentage of trapped particles increased with increasing film thickness. The results showed that AJM with the target covered by a thin liquid film is a viable way of increasing process cleanliness by decreasing the amount of airborne particulates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aglycerol 3aparticulates 3apolymers 3apowders 3aroughness 3aviscosity 0aAbrasive jet micro-machining 0aWater 0aGlycerin 0aPolymer solution 0aSurface roughness 0aErosion rate 0aGlass1 aHadavi, V.1 aSpelt, J.K.1 aPapini, M.0 tPowder technology.g2016 Nov., v. 301 p.1270-1274dElsevier B.V.x0032-59107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2016.08.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02360naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003600135040001800171100001900189245007800208300001600286506007600302520086600378592002801244506003701272650002301309650001001332650004201342650001701384650001601401650002501417650002101442650001201463650002501475650003901500650001801539650003401557650004201591650002501633650001101658650002701669700002201696773008101718856008201799852000901881655001201890IND60092519020221207112148.0141103e20110121xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009251902DNAL7 a212418892pmid7 aPMC30614322pmcid7 a10.1016/j.cell.2011.01.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Zhenhai10aHigh-Resolution Genome-wide Mapping of the Primary Structure of Chromatin  ap. 175-186.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe genomic organization of chromatin is increasingly recognized as a key regulator of cell behavior, but deciphering its regulation mechanisms requires detailed knowledge of chromatin's primary structure—the assembly of nucleosomes throughout the genome. This Primer explains the principles for mapping and analyzing the primary organization of chromatin on a genomic scale. After introducing chromatin organization and its impact on gene regulation and human health, we then describe methods that detect nucleosome positioning and occupancy levels using chromatin immunoprecipitation in combination with deep sequencing (ChIP-Seq), a strategy that is now straightforward and cost efficient. We then explore current strategies for converting the sequence information into knowledge about chromatin, an exciting challenge for biologists and bioinformaticians.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3achromosome mapping 3agenes 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3ahuman health 3anucleosomes 3anucleotide sequences 3aprecipitin tests 2aAnimals 2aChromatinxchemistry 2aChromatin Assembly and Disassembly 2aGenome, Human 2aGenome-Wide Association Study 2aHigh-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing 2aHistonesxmetabolism 2aHumans 2aNucleosomesxchemistry1 aPugh, B.

To reduce the costs of contests, animals are expected to assess the resource-holding potential of their rivals and compare it to their own as a means of economically determining a winner (‘mutual assessment’). If information about the rival is difficult or costly to obtain, rivals may instead reduce the costs of fighting by withdrawing when an individual cost threshold is reached (‘self-assessment’). Here we investigated the assessment strategies used by Servaea incana jumping spiders to resolve male–male contests. To examine the effects of body size on contest outcome and strategy, contests were staged between size-unmatched and size-matched pairs. Contests escalated through distinct stages that were of increasing intensity, and body size was a strong predictor of contest outcome. To gain insight into assessment strategy, we considered duration and escalation as measures of cost accrual. Overall, the relations of body size to contest duration and escalation suggest that the decision of whether to retreat during the early noncontact contest phase is largely determined by size-associated internal cost thresholds. Body size was not related to either duration or escalation in the contact phase of contests. We highlight the need to consider appropriateness of proxies used for contest costs and whether game-theoretical predictions for whole contests apply to stages within a contest.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalticidae 3aanimal behavior 3aanimals 3abody size 3acost effectiveness 3aenergy 3aprediction 3arisk 0ajumping spider 0amutual assessment 0aSalticidae 0aself-assessment 0aServaea incana1 aPrenter, John1 aTaylor, Phillip W.0 tAnimal behaviour.g2015 Mar., v. 101 p.89-95dElsevier LtdaThe Association for the Study of Animal BehaviourwJournal:jnl45841x0003-34727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2014.12.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02264naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092040001800121100002900139245006500168300001400233500001500247520109100262592002801353650001401381650002001395650001001415650002001425650003101445650002301476650001701499650001401516650001701530651001301547653002501560653001701585653002101602653002001623700002301643773010201666856007701768852000901845655001201854IND4400366520221119161256.0151127e200801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440036652DNAL7 a10.1614/WS-07-098.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchwinghamer, Timothy D.10aEmergence Timing and Persistence of Kochia (Kochia Scoparia)  ap. 37-41.  a2019-12-06  aThe predictability of the spring emergence period of kochia is a potentially exploitable attribute that may be applied to weed management. The emergence timing of kochia was monitored, during the spring and summer of 2005 and 2006, in 12 farmed fields in the northern region of the Northern Great Plains (NGP) of North America. Kochia emergence began at 50 cumulative growing-degree days (GDD Tbₐₛₑ 0 C, starting January 1) and continued into late summer. The onset of kochia emergence occurred well before the emergence onset of other weed species common to this region. Fall soil samples revealed few kochia seeds remained in the seedbank. In growth room studies, kochia seed placed at the soil surface had greater emergence compared with seed burial to a 10 mm or greater depth. Kochia did not emerge from seed planted 80 mm deep; however, radical emergence was evident indicating fatal germination. Kochia should be controlled early in the growing season, and burying seed will greatly reduce future kochia populations.Nomenclature: Kochia, Kochia scoparia (L.) Schrad.

In order to study complex systems it is often necessary to make categorizations, simplifying assumptions and analogies, and to use particular model structures and statistical tools. Such operations on the raw sensory data of nature may or may not be valid, and can make it difficult to evaluate the validity of a study. In this viewpoint article, I illustrate how ill-posed questions can confound the study of complex ecological systems. I offer several suggestions for overcoming this particular difficulty. Ill-posed questions are questions for which there are either no answers or only ambiguous (non-unique) answers. It is suggested that ill-posed questions are a particular problem in Ecology. Several types of ill-posed questions are discussed. Unobservable and uncountable phenomena (e.g., What happened before the Big Bang? How many stars are there?) are pervasive in Ecology because of the spatially and temporally diffuse interactions that characterize ecological systems. Vague terminology creates ill-posed discourse because different people use “fragmentation” or “niche” in different ways. Untestable theories are a common problem. Theories may be untestable because the objects of the theory are idealized and cannot be related to the real world, because terminology is vague, or for other reasons. Divergent metrics create ill-posed measurement problems. For example, many real world objects approximate fractal objects, at least at some scales, but they may be measured with an arbitrary length scale which differs between different studies. This means that metrics and conclusions from different studies are not comparable. Inconsistent classification systems are an issue. For example, map classifications lose rare habitat types when larger scale maps are created and thus habitat diversity metrics change with different levels of map resolution. Finally, statistical ill-posedness is a problem. This arises when the statistical test does not test or prove what it is thought to. A review of a selection of literature is used to illustrate the issues raised. Suggestions are offered for recognizing and dealing with ill-posed questions in Ecology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aecosystems 3ahabitat fragmentation 3aniches 3aterminology0 tEcological complexity.g2011 Mar., v. 8, no. 1 p.60-67dElsevier B.V.x1476-945X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecocom.2010.11.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02499naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001400152245011400166300001800280520118700298592002801485650002301513650003101536650002001567650001001587650001601597650003001613650002001643650002001663650003701683650001701720650001201737653003201749653002001781653002301801700001801824700001401842773013701856856008701993852000902080655001202089IND60739168420221120134852.0210729e20210731xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073916842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2021.05.1392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Yuxi10aClassification, structure and mechanism of antiviral polysaccharides derived from edible and medicinal fungus  ap. 1753-1773.  aThe deficiency of chemical-synthesized antiviral drugs when applied in clinical therapy, such as drug resistance, and the lack of effective antiviral drugs to treat some newly emerging virus infections, such as COVID-19, promote the demand of novelty and safety anti-virus drug candidate from natural functional ingredient.

Herein, our review focus on the two aspects, on the one hand, we discussed the type of anti-viral EMFs and the structural characteristics of polysaccharides to clarify the structure-activity relationship, on the other hand, the directly or indirectly antiviral mechanism of EMFs polysaccharides, including virus function suppression, immune-modulatory activity, anti-inflammatory activity, regulation of population balance of gut microbiota have been concluded to provide a comprehensive theory basis for better clinical utilization of EMFs polysaccharides as anti-viral agents.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3adrug resistance 3adrugs 3aingredients 3aintestinal microorganisms 3amedicinal fungi 3apolysaccharides 3astructure-activity relationships 3atherapeutics 3aviruses 0aEdible and medicinal fungus 0aPolysaccharides 0aAntiviral activity1 aChen, Xuefeng1 aGong, Pin0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2021 July 31, v. 183 p.1753-1773dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2021.05.1393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02550naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001900141245008800160520148000248592002801728650002401756650001201780650001401792650000901806650001701815650002901832650001501861650001901876650001401895650001001909700002401919700002101943700001901964773012001983856007602103852000902179655001202188IND60768232520221119151928.0220225e20220216xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076823252DNAL7 a10.3390/ani120404852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaji, Kenjiro 10aDetection of Canine Urothelial Carcinoma Cells in Urine Using 5-Aminolevulinic Acid  aThis study aimed to establish a method to detect canine urothelial carcinoma cells in urine using 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) and to evaluate its diagnostic accuracy. Urine samples were collected from 21 dogs diagnosed with urothelial carcinoma and three urothelial carcinoma cell lines were used. Urine samples obtained from seven healthy dogs were used as controls. Cells in the urine sediment, or urothelial carcinoma cell lines, were cultured with 5-ALA and then observed under a fluorescence microscope. Moreover, we examined the relationship between fluorescence intensity and the presence of metastasis as well as tumor invasion into the bladder wall in cases of urothelial carcinoma. Urine-derived cells from urothelial carcinoma and urothelial carcinoma cell lines showed clearer red fluorescence with the addition of 5-ALA compared to that exhibited by the cells from healthy dogs. The sensitivity and specificity of the diagnosis of urothelial carcinoma were 90% and 86%, respectively. Significant associations were found between fluorescence intensity and tumor metastasis and bladder wall invasion. This study showed that 5-ALA can be used to detect urothelial carcinoma cells in dogs with relatively high diagnostic accuracy. Further, the fluorescence intensity of tumor cells caused by 5-ALA correlated with the clinical condition of urothelial carcinoma cases, which suggested that 5-ALA could be used as a prognostic marker for canine urothelial carcinoma.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaminolevulinic acid 3abladder 3acarcinoma 3adogs 3afluorescence 3afluorescence microscopes 3ametastasis 3aneoplasm cells 3asediments 3aurine1 aYonezawa, Tomohiro 1 aMomoi, Yasuyuki 1 aMaeda, Shingo 0 tAnimals.g2022 Feb. 16, v. 12, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani120404853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02522naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245013400172300001500306520133500321592002801656650003801684650001701722650002201739650001801761650002601779650002201805650002201827650001501849650002801864651001301892700001901905700003201924773011201956856008302068852000902151655001202160IND60632565620221118083822.0190514e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063256562DNAL7 a10.1007/s12571-018-00884-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmbagna, Jean Joël10aEstimating trends in prevalence of undernourishment: advantages of using HCES over the FAO approach in a case study from Cameroon  ap. 93-107.  aGlobal and national food security policies require a good knowledge of trends in prevalence of undernourishment (PoU). Progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals might be difficult to assess if trends in undernourishment are not correctly estimated. However, methods of estimating PoU are still subject to debate. FAO Food Balance Sheets are used to measure food availability and undernourishment at country level. The aim of this paper is to compare trends in PoU using the FAO approach to that using Household Consumption and Expenditure Surveys (HCES). We used FAO Food Balance Sheets and parameters, and two nationwide representative Cameroonian Household Surveys (ECAM), conducted by the National Institute of Statistics (INS) in 2001 and 2007. Our findings, based on ECAM, show that 38% and 24% of the population were undernourished in 2001 and 2007, respectively. FAO estimates were 29% in 2001 and 17% in 2007. Both approaches showed a downward trend in PoU, but ECAM results showed a greater decrease. Using ECAM enabled disaggregation of trends in PoU by area of residence and region. This, in turn, will enable better targeting of vulnerable areas and disadvantaged segments of the population. The North and Far-North regions of the country were facing major food insecurity problems at the time of the surveys.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFood and Agriculture Organization 3acase studies 3afood availability 3afood security 3ahousehold consumption 3ahousehold surveys 3aissues and policy 3astatistics 3asustainable development 3aCameroon1 aDury, Sandrine1 aDop, M.

A remarkable feature of all these techniques is to extract useful chemical information from the spectral data as detailed as possible with the aid of chemometric methods with the aim of significantly improving both robustness and accuracy of analytical results. Under the general background of the development in artificial intelligence, big data, cloud computing, and other technologies, the emergence of novel idea, approaches, and strategies endows chemometrics with a new vitality. Chemometrics has become the research focuses and hotspots in various fields, especially in the field of spectral analysis. This article reviewed various chemometric methods applied in modern spectral analysis in recent ten years, especially from the perspective of practicability, including spectral pre-processing, wavelength (variable) selection, data dimension reduction, quantitative calibration, pattern recognition, calibration transfer, calibration maintenance, and multispectral data fusion. More importantly, future trends in chemometric methods in the field of spectral analysis was also prospected in this article. It is sincerely expected that this summary and review could give specialists and scholars in the fields of spectroscopy and chemometrics certain inspiration to accelerate modern spectral analysis techniques booming evolution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aartificial intelligence 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3achemical industry 3achemometrics 3aenvironmental protection 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apetroleum 3aspectral analysis 3atobacco 3awavelengths 0aChemometrics 0aPre-processing 0aVariable selection 0aData dimension reduction 0aCalibration transfer 0aData fusion 0aModern spectroscopy1 aChen, Pu1 aDai, Jia-Wei1 aLiu, Dan1 aLi, Jing-Yan1 aXu, Yu-Peng1 aChu, Xiao-Li0 tTrends in analytical chemistry.g2022 Aug., v. 153 p.116648-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11800x0165-99367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.trac.2022.1166483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02518naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245011600174300001800290520116000308592002801468650001701496650002301513650001801536650001801554650001501572650001501587650001001602650001201612650002001624650001101644653002201655653001201677653001201689653001301701653001401714653002701728700002301755700002901778700003201807773013701839856008701976852000902063655001202072IND60739168520221120124532.0210729e20210731xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073916852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2021.05.1402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTivārī, Svāti,10aBacterial exopolysaccharides for improvement of technological, functional and rheological properties of yoghurt  ap. 1585-1595.  aExopolysaccharides (EPS) are known to have technological and functional applications in food industry including dairy based products such as yoghurt. Yoghurt is a widely consumed dairy based product due to pleasant taste and texture, as well as a source of nutrients and bioactive compounds. At the same time, structural, rheological and sensorial properties are important in the production of good quality yoghurt. Various natural hydrocolloids including EPS with stabilizing and texture enhancing properties could be useful in enhancing these desirable properties. Apart from that, EPS may enhance various other functional properties of yoghurt such as antioxidant and prebiotic potential. Based on its prebiotic property, symbiotic products could be developed by combining EPS and probiotic bacterial strains. EPS has potential to provide physical and micro structural stability, thereby enhancing the protein distribution and viscoelastic properties. Main focus of the present review is to provide an insight on the action of EPS as a functional hydrocolloid on the technological, rheological and functional properties of yoghurt and related products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidants 3aexopolysaccharides 3afood industry 3ahydrocolloids 3aprebiotics 3aprobiotics 3ataste 3atexture 3aviscoelasticity 3ayogurt 0aExopolysaccharide 0aYoghurt 0aSensory 0aRheology 0aPrebiotic 0aAntioxidant properties1 aKavitake, Digambar1 aDevi, Palanisamy Bruntha1 aHalady Shetty, Prathapkumar0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2021 July 31, v. 183 p.1585-1595dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2021.05.1403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02543naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245011100167520137600278592002801654650000801682650001401690650001101704650001301715650000901728650002001737650001001757650002301767650001301790650001501803650001701818653001601835653001901851700001601870700001401886700002001900700001901920773009801939856008702037852000902124655001202133IND60697019820221119043101.0200726e20200715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069701982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.1152082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShen, Chao10aInvestigating the performance of a novel solar lighting/heating system using spectrum-sensitive nanofluids  aSolar lighting is considered as a promising technique, which has huge potential in conserving energy and relaxing the residents. However, current solar lighting systems used a filter to allow only visible light to enter buildings, releasing all the other energy contained in the long wave of the solar into the surrounding air. Such practice leaded to low efficiency of solar energy utilization and high costs. In this paper, a solar lighting/heating system was developed which used a hollow lens filled with ATO nanofluid to separate the long wave and short wave of solar energy. A series of tests were conducted to explore the performance of system. Results indicated that under the test condition of Case 1 (0.025%/0.0001% ATO/Graphite nanofluid, 100 L/h flow rate), the light transmission efficiency was 19.5% which was comparable to that of current solar lighting systems, and the heat absorption efficiency was 25.35%. The heat energy collected by the such a system from June to August (three months) in the city of Harbin was about 466.4 MJ in per square meter of collection area. The volume concentration of nanofluids had great influence on both the light transmission efficiency and the heat absorption efficiency. The flow rate had little influence on the light transmission efficiency, but had great influence on the heat absorption efficiency of the system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3abuildings 3aenergy 3agraphene 3aheat 3aheating systems 3alight 3alight transmission 3alighting 3ananofluids 3asolar energy 0aDaylighting 0aThermal energy1 aLv, Guoquan1 aWei, Shen1 aZhang, Chunxiao1 aRuan, Changyun0 tApplied energy.g2020 July 15, v. 270 p.115208-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.1152083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01714naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002200153245009700175300001600272520081800288592002801106653000901134653003101143653002101174653001001195653001901205700002201224773008201246856008701328852000901415655001201424IND60554857720221117091842.0161025e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055485772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cancergen.2015.04.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGoldman, Jamie M.10aBRAF V600E mutations: a series of case reports in patients with non–small cell lung cancer  ap. 351-354.  aWe present a series of five patients with BRAF-mutated non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) from the Moffitt Cancer Center and a brief literature review.

In this work, variations in anthocyanin concentration were determined in the leaves of Begonia semperflorens growing under high light (HL; 900 ?mol m-2 s-1) or low temperature (LT; 15°C day/6°C night) conditions. Partial cDNA sequences of four structural genes associated with the biosynthesis of anthocyanins were isolated from leaves. These genes encoded phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (BsPAL), chalcone synthase (BsCHS), flavonone-3-hydroxylase (BsF3H), and anthocyanidin synthase (BsANS). The patterns of expression of these genes after HL or LT treatment were investigated using real-time reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Anthocyanins, which remained at low concentrations in untreated leaves, increased significantly after HL or LT treatment.Transcript levels of all four genes corresponded, in general, with these changing patterns, but their expression profiles were significantly different between the HL and LT treatments. After LT treatment, the expression of BsPAL and BsF3H increased significantly in the first 2 d, then decreased, while transcript levels of BsCHS and BsANS increased gradually and reached their maximum level by day-6. During HL treatment, the expression of BsCHS and BsF3H responded almost immediately 0.5 d after treatment, then BsF3H expression decreased sharply to a level only slightly higher than in the untreated controls. However, expression of BsCHS remained at high levels. Expression of BsANS increased sharply 1 d after HL treatment, then decreased until day-4. Transcription of BsPAL increased rapidly 2 d after treatment, then decreased rapidly.

This molecule is generated by dephosphorylation of farnesyl pyrophosphate in the mevalonate biosynthetic pathway in mammalian and yeast cells. Exogenous farnesol inhibits yeast-to-hyphal formation in a concentration- and time-dependent manner at the earliest stage of hyphal development. Much research has been devoted to studying the role of farnesol as an inhibitor of hyphal morphogenesis; however, little research has been published regarding the in vivo impacts of farnesol on fungal virulence and the development of Candida infection. While other studies have examined the impact of multiple doses of farnesol in addition to antimycotics, we hypothesize that C. albicans treated with a single dose of this quorum-sensing molecule could reduce fungal virulence in a quail model.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCandida albicans 3aantifungal agents 3abiochemical pathways 3acandidiasis 3adephosphorylation 3afarnesol 3ahyphae 3amammals 3amorphogenesis 3aquails 3aquorum sensing 3asecretion 3asesquiterpenoids 3avirulence 3ayeasts1 aVasilieva, Elena 1 aLenchenko, Ekaterina 1 aKuznetsova, Olga 1 aKaramyan, Arfenia 1 aIbragimova, Alfia 1 aZhabo, Natalia 1 aMolchanova, Maria 0 tAnimals.g2022 Feb. 16, v. 12, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani120404893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02666naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002000188245006500208300001600273506007600289520133300365592002801698506003701726650001801763650002201781650001501803650002101818650000901839650002001848650002101868650002101889650001401910650002201924650002201946650001001968650001301978700001901991700002102010773009902031856008102130852000902211655001202220IND60082884420221207103320.0141101e201111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008288442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fsi.2011.03.0212doi7 aPMC34048372pmcid7 a214668542pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yong'an,10aRecent findings on the structure and function of teleost IgT  ap. 627-634.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAs key effector molecules of jawed vertebrate’s adaptive immune system, immunoglobulins are produced by B lymphocytes, either as a secretory form (antibody) or as a membrane form (B cell receptor). Until recently, teleost fish B cells were thought to express only two classes of immunoglobulins, IgM and IgD. In addition, IgM in these species was thought to be the only immunoglobulin isotype responding to pathogens both in systemic or mucosal compartments. However, the unexpected discovery of IgT, a new teleost immunoglobulin unearthed in 2005, has provided for new opportunities to analyze further roles of teleost immunoglobulins in these two physiologically distinct compartments. The smoke about the potential function of IgT has cleared recently with the finding that this immunoglobulin appears to be specialized in gut mucosal immunity. Significantly, the new capability of measuring not only IgM but also IgT responses will greatly facilitate the evaluation and understanding of fish immune responses as well as the protective effects of fish vaccines. The purpose of this review is to summarize the molecular characterization of new IgT orthologs and subtypes in teleosts, as well as to describe the new findings concerning the protein structure of IgT, the B cells producing it, and its role in mucosal immunity.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aB-lymphocytes 3aadaptive immunity 3aantibodies 3adigestive system 3afish 3aimmune response 3aimmunoglobulin M 3amucosal immunity 3apathogens 3aprotective effect 3aprotein structure 3asmoke 3avaccines1 aSalinas, Irene1 aOriol Sunyer, J.0 tFish & shellfish immunology.g2011 Nov., v. 31, no. 5 p.627-634dElsevier Ltdx1050-46487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2011.03.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03084naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245011700167520137500284592002801659650001801687650002101705650001101726650001301737650001901750650001901769650001801788650003801806650001201844650001501856650001401871650001101885650000901896650000901905650002601914650001401940650001301954650001201967650001401979650001301993650001502006650001202021653002702033653002602060653002502086653001702111653001902128700003002147700001802177700002202195700001702217700002302234700001702257773011202274856008702386852000902473655001202482IND60775503020221119092148.0220523e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077550302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jviromet.2022.1145362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMakesh, M.10aNervous necrosis virus titration and antigen quantitation by indirect sandwich enzyme linked immunosorbent assay  aViral nervous necrosis (VNN) is a serious disease of marine and brackishwater fishes caused by nervous necrosis virus (NNV) resulting in up to 100% mortality in early larval and juvenile stages. Adult fish when infected are asymptomatic and spread the virus vertically to the offspring through milt and eggs. Prevention of vertical transmission of the disease is by using disease free broodstock and vaccinating the brooders. Estimation of antigen content and virus titre is essential to determine antigen/virus concentration in VNN vaccine. A monoclonal antibody based indirect sandwich ELISA was developed to quantify the NNV antigen and to estimate the virus titre by TCID₅₀ coupled ELISA. Mouse hybridoma clones secreting monoclonal antibodies (MAb) against the capsid protein of NNV was developed and characterised. The antibodies reacted specifically with the recombinant capsid protein and purified virus in western blot. Polyclonal antibodies against NNV were used as capture antibodies and MAbs were used as detection antibodies to optimise an indirect sandwich ELISA to detect and quantify capsid protein of NNV. The developed assay had a sensitivity of 390 ng/ml and could detect the virus in clinical samples. The assay coupled with TCID₅₀ could be used to estimate the virus titre rather than by observing the CPE which is laborious and subjective.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBetanodavirus 3aWestern blotting 3aadults 3aantigens 3abrackish water 3abreeding stock 3acoat proteins 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aenzymes 3ahybridomas 3ajuveniles 3alarvae 3amice 3amilt 3amonoclonal antibodies 3amortality 3anecrosis 3aprogeny 3atitration 3avaccines 3aviral load 3aviruses 0aNervous necrosis virus 0aMonoclonal antibodies 0aAntigen quantitation 0aTCID50-ELISA 0aSandwich ELISA1 aVenkata Satyanarayana, N.1 aSelvamano, S.1 aJayaprakash, N.S.1 aBera, Aritra1 aSukumaran, Krishna1 aKailasam, M.0 tJournal of virological methods.g2022 July, v. 305 p.114536-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12356x0166-09347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2022.1145363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02195naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245009000165300001800255520101600273592002801289650001501317650001501332650001701347650001201364650001101376650002001387653002401407653003001431653002101461653002301482700001301505700001801518700002001536700001501556700001701571700001801588773008601606856008401692852000901776655001201785IND60556592920221120224800.0161102e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055659292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.powtec.2016.08.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Jilei10aGradient-structural optimization of metal fiber porous materials for sound absorption  ap. 1235-1241.  aMetal fiber porous material with full inter-connected pore structure, is a kind of attractive sound-absorbing material sintered by powder metallurgy process. In order to improve the sound absorption performance, the stainless steel fibers with different diameters were used to fabricate porous sound-absorbing materials with gradient pore structures in this paper. Two or three layers of sintered fiber porous plats with different pore structures were superposed in a certain sequence and then sintered to gradient porous materials. The effects of gradient pore structure on the sound absorption performance were also investigated. The results show that the gradient porous structure can effectively improve the sound absorption performance, and the direction and quantity of the pore gradient interface also exhibit remarkable effects on the sound absorption performance. The sound waves repeatedly reflect in the porous media between the gradient interfaces, which contributes to sound absorption improvement.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3ametallurgy 3aporous media 3apowders 3asounds 3astainless steel 0aPorous metal fibers 0aGradient porous structure 0aSound absorption 0aGradient interface1 aSun, Jun1 aTang, Huiping1 aWang, Jianzhong1 aAo, Qingbo1 aBao, Tengfei1 aSong, Weidong0 tPowder technology.g2016 Nov., v. 301 p.1235-1241dElsevier B.V.x0032-59107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2016.08.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02035naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100005600188245008800244300001300332506007600345520091800421592002801339506003701367650001401404650001501418650001401433650001601447650001101463700002001474700002101494773008001515856008101595852000901676655001201685IND60625302020221207072737.0200110s2019    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062530202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mex.2018.12.0042doi7 aPMC63082602pmcid7 a305960242pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlef, Khalid1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1751-563610aDegradation and hydrate phase equilibria measurement methods of monoethylene glycol  ap. 6-14.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMonoethylene glycol (MEG), a common chemical used for the inhibition of gas hydrate formation may undergo degradation in the regeneration/reclamation process.

In comparison, examples of functional UV reflectance among invertebrates are scarce. In a territorial damselfly (Megaloprepus caerulatus), data from natural territorial contests indicated that males assessed the male wing band of rivals. We investigated the functions of (1) UV reflectance of the male-specific white wing band in territorial contests by staging contests between size- and age-matched, control and UV-reduced males, and (2) UV reflectance of the female-specific wing tip in sex recognition by presenting control and UV-reduced females to territorial males. Results showed that males whose UV reflectance of the white wing bands was reduced were more likely to lose contests. This effect dissipated late in the reproductive season, when breeding sites typically decrease in value. UV reflectance of the female wing tips did not affect male sex recognition, nor did it affect the detectability of a female at a male territory. Our study provides the first direct evidence from invertebrates, and one of the few among all animals, that UV reflectance of wing ornamentation affects the outcome of male contests in the field.  aPublisher supplied data 3abreeding season 3abreeding sites 3afemales 3ainvertebrates 3amales 3amating behavior 3areflectance 3asexual dimorphism 3aterritoriality 3avertebrates 3avision 0aMegaloprepus 0arival assessment 0aseasonal effect 0asex recognition 0asexual signalling 0aUV reflectance1 aFincke, Ola M.0 tAnimal behaviour.g2015 Mar., v. 101 p.67-74dElsevier LtdaThe Association for the Study of Animal BehaviourwJournal:jnl45841x0003-34727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2014.12.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02550naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002200166245009000188300001800278500001500296520093300311592002801244650000901272650001601281650002701297650001701324650002701341650001701368650002001385650001301405650001601418650001701434650002201451650001401473650001901487650002901506650001601535650001101551650002801562650002001590650002001610650003001630650005601660651000901716651000901725653001001734700002301744700002301767700002001790773011701810856004801927852000901975655001201984IND50062031620221118005606.0130321e201302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006203162DNAL7 a225927852pmid7 a10.1007/s10661-012-2670-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheraghi, Mehrdad10aHeavy metal risk assessment for potatoes grown in overused phosphate-fertilized soils  ap. 1825-1831.  a2019-12-06  aThe long-term application of phosphate fertilizers on vegetable production fields has raised concerns about the potential health risks of heavy metal contamination of crops grown on contaminated soils in the Hamadan province, western Iran. This study found that long-term fertilizer use led to a growing accumulation of heavy metals in soils. High concentrations of elemental As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb, and Zn were found in potatoes sampled from overused phosphate-fertilized soils, which increased the daily intake of metals in food. However, the ingestion of potatoes from soils affected by phosphate fertilizers posed a low health risk when compared with the health risk index of <1 for heavy metals. Nevertheless, heavy metal concentrations should be periodically monitored in vegetables grown in these soils. It would also be beneficial to implement effective remediation technologies to minimize possible impacts on human health.  aPublisher supplied data 3arisk 3afood intake 3afertilizer application 3aheavy metals 3aphosphorus fertilizers 3ahuman health 3arisk assessment 3apotatoes 3aremediation 3asoil texture 3avegetable growing 3aingestion 3apolluted soils 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aFertilizers 2aHumans 2aMetals, Heavyxanalysis 2aRisk Assessment 2aSoilxchemistry 2aSoil Pollutantsxanalysis 2aSolanum tuberosumxchemistryxgrowth & development. 3aIran 0aIran 0acrops1 aLorestani, Bahareh1 aMerrikhpour, Hajar1 aRouniasi, Nasim0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2013 Feb., v. 185, no. 2 p.1825-1831dSpringer-Verlagx0167-63697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-012-2670-5  aDNAL 7aarticle03174naa a2200781 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100001300189245009800202506007600300520103200376592002801408506003701436650001801473650002701491650002401518650001801542650003201560650002301592650001901615650001101634650001501645650002001660650001101680650002001691650001001711650001301721650001201734650002101746650001101767650001401778650000701792650001301799650001401812650000901826653001001835653000801845653000901853653000901862653000901871653000901880653000901889653000901898653000701907653000801914653001201922653001101934653001001945653001001955653002501965653003401990653001602024653001702040653002402057700001702081700005602098700001202154700002102166773010202187856008202289852000902371655001202380IND60625302120221207072754.0181217e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062530212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.btre.2018.e002952doi7 aPMC62901342pmcid7 a305688892pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Tang10aCold-active extracellular lipase: Expression in Sf9 insect cells, purification, and catalysis  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCold-active lipases are gaining special attention nowadays as they are increasingly used in various industries such as fine chemical synthesis, food processing, and washer detergent. In the present study, an extracellular lipase gene from Yarrowia lipolytica (LIPY8) was cloned and expressed by baculovirus expression system. The recombinant lipase (LipY8p) was purified using chromatographic techniques, resulting in a purification factor of 25.7-fold with a specific activity of 1102.9U/mg toward olive oil. The apparent molecular mass of purified LipY8p was 40 kDa. The enzyme was most active at pH 7.5 and 17 °C. It exhibited maximum activity toward medium chain (C10) esters. The presence of transition metals such as Zn2+, Cu2+, and Ni2+ strongly inhibited the enzyme activity, which was enhanced by EDTA. The lipase activity was affected by detergents and was elevated by various organic solvents at 10% (v/v). These enzymatic properties make this lipase of considerable potential for biotechnological applications.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBaculoviridae 3aEDTA (chelating agent) 3aYarrowia lipolytica 3abiotechnology 3acarboxylic ester hydrolases 3acatalytic activity 3achromatography 3acopper 3adetergents 3aenzyme activity 3aesters 3afood processing 3agenes 3aindustry 3ainsects 3amolecular weight 3anickel 3aolive oil 3apH 3asolvents 3asynthesis 3azinc 0aC12E8 0aDMF 0apNPA 0apNPB 0apNPD 0apNPL 0apNPM 0apNPP 0aPH 0aRhB 0aRhB-OOe 0aβ-DDM 0aβ-ME 0aβ-OG 0aExtracellular lipase 0aBaculovirus expression system 0aCold-active 0aPurification 0aYarrowia lipolytica1 aZhang, Wenfa1 aHao, Jianhua1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7634-75671 aSun, Mi1 aLin, Sheng-Xiang0 tBiotechnology reports.g2019 Mar., v. 21 p.e00295-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23403x2215-017X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.btre.2018.e002953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04395naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001800188245010700206300001100313506007600324520282400400592002803224506003703252650000803289650001303297650001603310650001803326650002103344650003403365650002003399650002403419650001403443650001203457650002203469650002403491650001003515650001603525650002603541700002003567700002203587700002003609700002303629773015903652856008103811852000903892655001203901IND60465888020221207084236.0151123e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6046588802DNAL7 a10.1186/s12966-014-0095-y2doi7 aPMC42237632pmcid7 a250529052pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPhilips, Nele14aThe influence of parenting style on health related behavior of children: findings from the ChiBS study  ap. 95.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aOBJECTIVE: Exploring associations between parenting behavior and children’s health related behavior including physical activity, sedentary behavior, diet and sleep. METHODS: We recruited 288 parents and their children (6-12y old). Children’s weight and height were measured. Fat percentage was determined by air displacement plethysmography. Parents reported socio-demographic data, sleep information, physical activity and sedentary behavior of their child and completed the Comprehensive General Parenting Questionnaire (CGPQ) and a Food Frequency Questionnaire. Children completed the Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire. Associations between parenting behavior (CGPQ) and children’s health related behavior were assessed with univariate and multiple regression analyses. RESULTS: A small positive correlation was found between sweet food consumption frequency and “coercive control” (r = 0.139) and a small negative correlation between fruit and vegetables consumption frequency and “overprotection” (r = −0.151). Children consumed more frequently soft drinks when their parents scored lower on “structure” (r = −0.124) and higher on “overprotection” (r = 0.123); for the light soft drinks separately, a small positive correlation with “behavioral control” was found (r = 0.172). A small negative correlation was found between “emotional eating” and “structure” (r = −0.172) as well as “behavioral control” (r = −0.166). “Coercive control” was negatively correlated with the child’s sleep duration (r = −0.171). After correction for confounding factors, the following significant associations were found: (1) a small negative association between “structure” and soft drinks consumption (β = −0.17 for all soft drinks and −0.22 for light soft drinks), (2) a small positive association between “behavioral control” and light soft drinks (β = 0.34), (3) a small positive association of “nurturance” and “coercive control” with sedentary behavior (β = 0.16 for both parent constructs) and (4) a small negative association between the parenting construct “coercive control” and sleep duration (β = −0.23). CONCLUSION: The significant but small associations between parenting constructs and the investigated variables suggest that different aspects of parenting style play an important role in the genesis of the health related behavior of children. Overall, our findings suggest that health professionals should encourage parents to apply the more positive parenting constructs i.e., more “structure” and “behavioral control”, and less “coercive control”. They could, for instance, supervise and manage their child’s activities and help their child to achieve certain goals.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aair 3achildren 3acorrelation 3aeating habits 3afood consumption 3afood frequency questionnaires 3ahealth behavior 3ahealth care workers 3aparenting 3aparents 3aphysical activity 3aregression analysis 3asleep 3asoft drinks 3avegetable consumption1 aSioen, Isabelle1 aMichels, Nathalie1 aSleddens, Ester1 aDe Henauw, Stefaan0 tinternational journal of behavioral nutrition and physical activity.g2014 Dec., v. 11, no. 1 p.95-95dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4350546x1479-58687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12966-014-0095-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02693naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132100001800150245011200168300001600280520163400296592002801930650001201958650001201970650001401982650002501996650002002021650001202041650001502053650001102068650001502079650001602094700002002110700002002130773008602150856008602236852000902322655001202331IND4479335320221119101307.0141110e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447933532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biombioe.2012.01.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Bo-Yuan10aUse of different alkaline pretreatments and enzyme models to improve low-cost cellulosic biomass conversion  ap. 182-191.  aTwo commonly alkaline pretreatment processes base on aqueous ammonia and lime under different enzyme hydrolysis models were evaluated to provide comparative sugar production performance from silvergrass, napiergrass and rice straw. The chemical composition variation of all biomass were nearly in stable after 4 weeks pretreatment under room temperature and recovery of the cellulose fraction was >90% by both pretreatment methods, the silvergrass recovered more dry matter than other biomass after pretreatment. Compared with other combination of pretreatment and enzyme model, mixed enzyme model after lime pretreatment significantly enhanced the biomass degradation especially in silvergrass and rice straw, but single enzyme supplement (cellulase or hemicellulase) result in limited sugar yield in this study. The biomass conversion result showed that considerable sugar yield from untreated napiergrass under the mixed enzyme model. However, alkaline pretreatment had no positive effect on glucose conversion from napiergrass. Increasing the mixed enzyme activity from 2.89 to 10.68 FPU g⁻¹ improved the glucose yield from 3.4 to 4.4 times and from 2.8 to 3.3 times after ammonia and lime pretreatment, respectively. The findings of this study suggest that pretreatment methods and enzyme loading model should be considered simultaneously to enhance cellulosic biomass degradation. Furthermore, the pretreatment method should be applied according to the fiber composition of the biomass. The suitable pretreatment process and constituent of enzyme mixture for individual cellulosic biomass is a promising line of inquiry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonia 3abiomass 3acellulose 3achemical composition 3aenzyme activity 3aglucose 3ahydrolysis 3amodels 3arice straw 3atemperature1 aChen, Shiau-Wei1 aWang, Han-Tsung0 tBiomass and bioenergy.g2012 Apr., v. 39 p.182-191dElsevier Ltdx0961-95347nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biombioe.2012.01.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02842naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002500143245008600168500001400254520145600268592002801724650000801752650002501760650001701785650001301802650001401815650002301829650001101852650001801863650001501881650002001896650000801916650001801924650002101942650001101963650001301974650002201987650001302009650003102022650001302053700002502066700002202091700003502113773012602148856007702274852000902351655001202360IND60718854420221120161540.0201126e20201106xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071885442DNAL7 a10.3390/antiox91110922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJakubczyk, Karolina 10aAntioxidant Potential of Curcumin—A Meta-Analysis of Randomized Clinical Trials  aNAL-light  aBackground: Antioxidant potential is defined as the ability to neutralize oxygen free radicals that are generated in excess due to environmental influences. The body’s defense mechanisms often require support in preventing the effects of oxidative stress. The literature data suggest that curcumin has antioxidant activity that can significantly reduce oxidative stress levels. The aim was to assess the impact of curcumin on oxidative stress markers. Methods: PubMed and Embase were searched from database inception until 27 September 2019 for randomized clinical trials in >20 patients treated with curcumin supplements and randomized to placebo/no intervention/physical activity to verify the antioxidant potential of curcumin. Results: Four studies were included in the meta-analysis, three of which were double-blind and one single-blind. A total of 308 participants took part in the research. A total of 40% of the respondents were men. The average age of participants was 27.60 ± 3.79 years. The average supplementation time was 67 days and the average dose of curcumin administered was 645 mg/24 h. Curcumin significantly increased total antioxidant capacity (TAC) (SMD = 2.696, Z = 2.003, CI = 95%, p = 0.045) and had a tendency to decrease malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration (SMD = -1.579, Z = -1.714, CI = 95%, p = 0.086). Conclusions: Pure curcumin has the potential to reduce MDA concentration and increase total antioxidant capacity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aage 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3acurcumin 3adatabases 3adefense mechanisms 3adosage 3afree radicals 3aliterature 3amalondialdehyde 3amen 3ameta-analysis 3aoxidative stress 3aoxygen 3apatients 3aphysical activity 3aplacebos 3arandomized clinical trials 3aresearch1 aDrużga, Aleksandra 1 aKatarzyna, Janda 1 aSkonieczna-Żydecka, Karolina 0 tAntioxidants.g2020 Nov. 06, v. 9, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27130x2076-39217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/antiox91110923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02453naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003600113040001800149100002500167245007000192300001600262520092900278592002801207650001601235650001101251650001201262650001601274650002401290650001501314650001801329650005801347650001101405650002801416650001301444650004901457650004301506650003301549650002301582700002101605700002201626700002101648700001401669700001601683700002101699700002301720700001801743773009501761856008201856852000901938655001201947IND60092519520221122004708.0141103e20110204xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009251952DNAL7 a212956982pmid7 a10.1016/j.cell.2010.12.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCapotosti, Francesca10aO-GlcNAc Transferase Catalyzes Site-Specific Proteolysis of HCF-1  ap. 376-388.  aThe human epigenetic cell-cycle regulator HCF-1 undergoes an unusual proteolytic maturation process resulting in stably associated HCF-1N and HCF-1C subunits that regulate different aspects of the cell cycle. Proteolysis occurs at six centrally located HCF-1PRO-repeat sequences and is important for activation of HCF-1C-subunit functions in M phase progression. We show here that the HCF-1PRO repeat is recognized by O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine transferase (OGT), which both O-GlcNAcylates the HCF-1N subunit and directly cleaves the HCF-1PRO repeat. Replacement of the HCF-1PRO repeats by a heterologous proteolytic cleavage signal promotes HCF-1 proteolysis but fails to activate HCF-1C-subunit M phase functions. These results reveal an unexpected role of OGT in HCF-1 proteolytic maturation and an unforeseen nexus between OGT-directed O-GlcNAcylation and proteolytic maturation in HCF-1 cell-cycle regulation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aepigenetics 3ahumans 3amitosis 3aproteolysis 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aCell Cycle 2aGlycosylation 2aHost Cell Factor C1xchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aHumans 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutation 2aN-Acetylglucosaminyltransferasesxmetabolism 2aProtein Processing, Post-Translational 2aProtein Subunitsxmetabolism 2aSequence Alignment1 aGuernier, Sophie1 aLammers, Fabienne1 aWaridel, Patrice1 aCai, Yong1 aJin, Jingji1 aConaway, Joan W.1 aConaway, Ronald C.1 aHerr, Winship0 tCell.g2011 Feb. 4, v. 144, no. 3 p.376-388dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11769x0092-86747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2010.12.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02655naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003600113040001800149100002700167245009000194300001600284520098600300592002801286650002601314650002001340650002201360650001501382650002001397650001101417650001201428650003301440650003001473650003801503650003201541650004001573650003401613650004801647650004801695650003501743650005201778650005001830700002301880700001801903700002401921700001501945700001801960773008001978856008202058852000902140655001202149IND60092519620221122025027.0141103e20110204xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009251962DNAL7 a212956992pmid7 a10.1016/j.cell.2010.12.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStefan, Christopher J.10aOsh Proteins Regulate Phosphoinositide Metabolism at ER-Plasma Membrane Contact Sites  ap. 389-401.  aSac1 phosphoinositide (PI) phosphatases are essential regulators of PI-signaling networks. Yeast Sac1, an integral endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane protein, controls PI4P levels at the ER, Golgi, and plasma membrane (PM). Whether Sac1 can act in trans and turn over PI4P at the Golgi and PM from the ER remains a paradox. We find that Sac1-mediated PI4P metabolism requires the oxysterol-binding homology (Osh) proteins. The PH domain-containing family member, Osh3, localizes to PM/ER membrane contact sites dependent upon PM PI4P levels. We reconstitute Osh protein-stimulated Sac1 PI phosphatase activity in vitro. We also show that the ER membrane VAP proteins, Scs2/Scs22, control PM PI4P levels and Sac1 activity in vitro. We propose that Osh3 functions at ER/PM contact sites as both a sensor of PM PI4P and an activator of the ER Sac1 phosphatase. Our findings further suggest that the conserved Osh proteins control PI metabolism at additional membrane contact sites.  aPublisher supplied data 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3aenzyme activity 3amembrane proteins 3ametabolism 3aplasma membrane 3ayeasts 2aAnimals 2aCarrier Proteinsxmetabolism 2aCell Membranexmetabolism 2aEndoplasmic Reticulumxmetabolism 2aGolgi Apparatusxmetabolism 2aIntracellular Membranesxmetabolism 2aMembrane Proteinsxmetabolism 2aPhosphatidylinositol Phosphatesxmetabolism 2aPhosphoric Monoester Hydrolasesxmetabolism 2aReceptors, Steroidxmetabolism 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexcytologyxmetabolism. 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiae Proteinsxmetabolism1 aManford, Andrew G.1 aBaird, Daniel1 aYamada-Hanff, Jason1 aMao, Yuxin1 aEmr, Scott D.0 tCell.g2011 Feb. 4, v. 144, no. 3 p.389-401dElsevier Inc.x0092-86747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2010.12.0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03058naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002100152245012700173300001600300520160600316592002801922650002401950650001301974650002001987650002902007650002502036650002002061650002602081650002302107650001502130650001602145650001902161650001102180650002602191650001602217650000902233650001302242650001202255651001402267651001802281700002202299700002102321700002302342700001902365773011602384856005502500852000902555655001202564IND4468284920221121040711.0120727e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446828492DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1439-0434.2011.01828.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarmona, Marcelo10aRelationship between Late Soybean Diseases Complex and Rain in Determining Grain Yield Responses to Fungicide Applications  ap. 687-693.  aWide distribution of soybean monoculture associated with no tillage has contributed to enhance damages caused by late diseases complex (LDC) in Argentina. LDC is a complex of diseases where Septoria glycines and Cercospora kikuchii are regarded as the major problem. Even though the use of foliar fungicides has increased, there is no rational and economic guide for their use. This is the main reason why the response to foliar fungicide applications is unpredictable. One of the main factors that contribute to the development of LDC is rainfall. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of rainfall during several growing seasons and different soybean growth stages on LDC severity and yield. We carried out 18 field experiments during three growing seasons (2004–2006) at several locations in the Argentine Pampas Region, to examine the relationship between rain and yield response to single fungicide applications (quinone outside inhibitors and demethylation inhibitors) at growing stages R3 and R5. The strongest associations (R2 = 0.81–0.84; P < 0.001) were observed between accumulated rainfall from R3 to R5 and yield response to fungicides applied in R3 or R5. Our results suggest that a minimum of 65–90 mm rainfall during R3–R5 is required to justify fungicide application, with high probability that the use of fungicide will increase soybean yield as a consequence of disease control. These findings could lead to a simple model, useful as decision support system for use in planning and scheduling spray applications for LDC management in soybean crops.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCercospora kikuchii 3aSeptoria 3acrop management 3adecision support systems 3adevelopmental stages 3adisease control 3afield experimentation 3afoliar application 3afungicides 3agrain yield 3agrowing season 3amodels 3apesticide application 3aprobability 3arain 3asoybeans 3atillage 3aArgentina 3aPampas region1 aSautua, Francisco1 aPerelman, Susana1 aReis,  Erlei Melo 1 aGally, Marcela0 tPhytopathologische Zeitschrift.g2011 Oct., v. 159, no. 10 p.687-693dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0931-17857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0434.2011.01828.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02422naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005500150245011400205300001800319520134800337592002801685650001101713650001101724650001301735650001101748650001801759650001201777653001701789653001101806653001701817653001801834653001401852653001501866773008601881856008401967852000902051655001202060IND60556593220221122001751.0161102e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055659322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.powtec.2016.08.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAltun, Okay1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9823-313010aSimulation aided flow sheet optimization of a cement grinding circuit by considering the quality measurements  ap. 1242-1251.  aThe paper focusses on improving the energy utilization of a cement grinding circuit by changing the flow sheet of the process. The circuit was comprised of ball mill, static classifier and dynamic classifier and in the current flow sheet the fine product of static classifier is sent to feed stream of dynamic classifier. However, it was experimentally proved that sending static fine to the final product silo had several benefits. In order to quantify the benefits, 250kg of static fine stream was collected then mixed with the final product and series of tests i.e., compressive strength, particle size, chemical assays and water demand, were undertaken. The results showed that mixing static fine with final product increased the 28-day strength by 2.3%, 4.3% and 4.8% for CEM I, CEM II and CEM IV type cements respectively. Improved strength results were attributed to having wider size distributed product (reduced slope value) that decreased the water demand of the cement. Such an increase in strength enabled to coarsen the final product at the same quality figures. Therefore, in the next phase of the study, the grinding circuit was simulated as the static fine stream would be sent to final product silo that indicated the production rates of the circuit could be increased by 9.7% for CEM II, 7.4% for both CEM I and CEM IV types.  aPublisher supplied data 3acement 3aenergy 3agrinding 3amixing 3aparticle size 3apowders 0aOptimization 0aCement 0aDry grinding 0aFine grinding 0aModelling 0aSimulation0 tPowder technology.g2016 Nov., v. 301 p.1242-1251dElsevier B.V.x0032-59107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2016.08.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02442naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002700141245008700168520133800255592002801593650001101621650001601632650001401648650001801662650001801680650002001698650001101718650002201729650002001751650001701771650001201788650001601800700002201816700002501838773012001863856007601983852000902059655001202068IND60768233220221119151915.0220225e20220217xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076823322DNAL7 a10.3390/ani120404942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMainguy-Seers, Sophie 10aLung Function Variation during the Estrus Cycle of Mares Affected by Severe Asthma  aWhile the prevalence of asthma is higher in boys than in girls during childhood, this tendency reverses at puberty, suggesting an effect of sex hormones on the disease pathophysiology. Fluctuations of asthma severity concurring with the estrus cycle are reported in women, but this phenomenon has never been investigated in mares to date. The objective of this exploratory study was to determine whether the estrus cycle modulates airway obstruction in severe equine asthma (SEA). Five mares with SEA during exacerbation of the disease were studied. The whole breath, expiratory and inspiratory resistance, and reactance were compared during the follicular and luteal phases of the estrus cycle. The reproductive tract was evaluated by rectal palpation, ultrasound, and serum progesterone levels. The inspiratory resistance and reactance improved during the luteal phase of the estrus cycle, and variation in progesterone levels and the dominant follicle size correlated with several lung function parameters. The fluctuation of airway dysfunction during the estrus cycle is noteworthy as deterioration of the disease could perhaps be expected and prevented by horse owners and veterinarians. Further studies are required to determine if the equine species could be a suitable model to evaluate the effects of sex hormones on asthma.  aPublisher supplied data 3aasthma 3ablood serum 3achildhood 3aestrous cycle 3alung function 3amenstrual cycle 3amodels 3aovarian follicles 3apathophysiology 3aprogesterone 3apuberty 3aultrasonics1 aDiaw, Mouhamadou 1 aLavoie, Jean-Pierre 0 tAnimals.g2022 Feb. 17, v. 12, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani120404943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03208naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100001500161245008400176300001600260500000900276520150700285592002801792650001501820650001601835650002201851650001301873650001601886650002501902650000901927650000901936650002001945650003301965650002801998650001002026650001302036650000802049650000902057650000902066650001002075650001802085650000902103650001702112650001502129650002002144650000702164650001502171650000902186650001102195650002002206650001902226650001802245650001602263650001502279651001502294700002002309773014802329856009602477852000902573655001202582IND60667943420221120114241.0191125e198003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066794342DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1980.03615995004400020027x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPastor J.,10aSoil Development on Moraines of Taylor Glacier, Lower Taylor Valley, Antarctica  ap. 341-348.  aepub  aSoils were examined on moraines deposited by Taylor Glacier in lower Taylor Valley to determine changes in soil properties with time in an environment of extreme cold and aridity and minimal biologic activity. The soils range in age from 200,000 to 2.7-3.5 million years BP. Soil profiles contain a desert pavement over a weakly expressed B horizon, followed by permafrost, which may be “dry” or ice-cemented. The soils are alkaline (pH 7.5 to 9.0) and are enriched in salts. Based on X-ray diffraction, the salts are mirabilite (Na₂SO₄·10H₂O), tachyhydrite (CaMg₂Cl₆·12H₂0), and halite (NaCl). Electrical conductivity of the salt-enriched zone ranges from 2.8 to 9 mmho cm⁻¹. Sodium and chloride are the dominant ions in 1.5 soil/water extracts. Ion ratios suggest that the bulk of the salts are of marine aerosol origin. The soils are generally gravelly sands, but the amounts of clay (<2 µm) and medium+fine silt (2–20 µm) increase with soil age. Free iron also increases with age. Secondary clay minerals include montmorillonite, vermiculite, and interstratified layer silicates. The predominant clay mineral weathering process is hydration of mica. The age-soil property relationship may have been influenced by microclimatic variations, previous occurrence of lakes dammed by a westward flowing marine ice sheet, mass-wasting processes, and persistent ice-cemented frost table in the solum. The soils are classified as Pergelic Cryorthents, sandy-skeletal, mixed, frigid.  aPublisher supplied data 3aB horizons 3aCryorthents 3aX-ray diffraction 3aaerosols 3aage of soil 3abioactive properties 3aclay 3acold 3adesert pavement 3adry environmental conditions 3aelectrical conductivity 3afrost 3aglaciers 3aice 3aions 3airon 3alakes 3amass movement 3amica 3amicroclimate 3amirabilite 3amontmorillonite 3apH 3apermafrost 3asilt 3asodium 3asodium chloride 3asodium sulfate 3asoil profiles 3avermiculite 3aweathering 3aAntarctica1 aBockheim, J.

When two competitors are similarly motivated, the resolution of conflicts may be achieved in the course of an interactive process. In barn owls, Tyto alba, in which siblings vocally compete during the prolonged absence of parents over access to the next delivered food item, we investigated what governs the decision to leave or enter a contest, and at which level. Siblings alternated periods during which one of the two individuals vocalized more than the other. Individuals followed turn-taking rules to interrupt each other and momentarily dominate the vocal competition. These social rules were weakly sensitive to hunger level and age hierarchy. Hence, the investment in a conflict is determined not only by need and resource-holding potential, but also by social interactions. The use of turn-taking rules governing individual vocal investment has rarely been shown in a competitive context. We hypothesized that these rules would allow individuals to remain alert to one another's motivation while maintaining the cost of vocalizing at the lowest level.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTyto alba 3aanimals 3amotivation 3aparents 3asiblings 3avocalization 0acommunication 0acompetition 0aconflict dynamics 0anegotiation 0asibling 0asignalling 0asocial rules 0aturn taking 0avocal rules1 aRuppli, Charlène A.1 aFaller, Christof1 aRoulin, Alexandre0 tAnimal behaviour.g2015 Apr., v. 102 p.95-107dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45841x0003-34727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2014.12.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04221naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002200143245016200165500001400327520215000341592002802491650002302519650002502542650001702567650001102584650002402595650002102619650001302640650001602653650001702669650001302686650002102699650001502720650002702735650001502762650002102777650002002798650001002818650001302828650002802841650002002869650001502889650002802904650001102932650001302943650001602956650002002972650002102992650002203013650001403035650001403049650001703063650002803080650001203108650002903120650002503149700002003174700002203194700002503216700001703241700001903258700002203277773012603299856007703425852000903502655001203511IND60718854820221120095911.0201126e20201108xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071885482DNAL7 a10.3390/antiox91110962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGraziani, Giulia 10aChanges in Phenolics and Fatty Acids Composition and Related Gene Expression during the Development from Seed to Leaves of Three Cultivated Cardoon Genotypes  aNAL-light  aCultivated cardoon (Cynara cardunculus var. altilis) has long been used as a food and medicine remedy and nowadays is considered a functional food. Its leaf bioactive compounds are mostly represented by chlorogenic acids and coumaroyl derivatives, known for their nutritional value and bioactivity. Having antioxidant and hepatoprotective properties, these molecules are used for medicinal purposes. Apart from the phenolic compounds in green tissues, cultivated cardoon is also used for the seed oil, having a composition suitable for the human diet, but also valuable as feedstock for the production of biofuel and biodegradable bioplastics. Given the wide spectrum of valuable cardoon molecules and their numerous industrial applications, a detailed characterization of different organs and tissues for their metabolic profiles as well as an extensive transcriptional analysis of associated key biosynthetic genes were performed to provide a deeper insight into metabolites biosynthesis and accumulation sites. This study aimed to provide a comprehensive analysis of the phenylpropanoids profile through UHPLC-Q-Orbitrap HRMS analysis, of fatty acids content through GC-MS analysis, along with quantitative transcriptional analyses by qRT-PCR of hydroxycinnamoyl-quinate transferase (HQT), stearic acid desaturase (SAD), and fatty acid desaturase (FAD) genes in seeds, hypocotyls, cotyledons and leaves of the cardoon genotypes “Spagnolo”, “Bianco Avorio”, and “Gigante”. Both oil yield and total phenols accumulation in all the tissues and organs indicated higher production in “Bianco Avorio” and “Spagnolo” than in “Gigante”. Antioxidant activity evaluation by DPPH, ABTS, and FRAP assays mirrored total phenols content. Overall, this study provides a detailed analysis of tissue composition of cardoon, enabling to elucidate value-added product accumulation and distribution during plant development and hence contributing to better address and optimize the sustainable use of this natural resource.

To date no studies on fish Rab have been documented, though rab-like sequences have been found in a number of teleosts. In this study, we identified and analyzed a Rab homologue, SoRab1, from red drum, Sciaenops ocellatus. The cDNA of SoRab1 contains a 5′- untranslated region (UTR) of 358 bp, an open reading frame (ORF) of 612 bp, and a 3′-UTR of 265 bp. The ORF encodes a putative protein of 203 residues, which shares 92–99% overall sequence identities with the Rab1 from fish, human, and mouse. SoRab1 possesses a typical Rab1 GTPase domain with the conserved G box motifs and the switch I and switch II regions. Recombinant SoRab1 purified from Escherichia coli exhibits apparent GTPase activity. Quantitative real time RT-PCR analysis showed that SoRab1 expression was detected in a number of tissues, with the lowest expression found in blood and highest expression found in muscle. Bacterial and lipopolysaccharide challenges significantly upregulated SoRab1 expression in liver, kidney, and spleen in time-dependent manners. Transient overexpression of SoRab1 in primary hepatocytes reduced intracellular bacterial infection, whereas interference with SoRab1 expression by RNAi enhanced intracellular bacterial invasion. These results provide the first indication that a fish Rab1 GTPase, SoRab1, regulates intracellular bacterial infection and thus is likely to play a role in bacteria-induced host immune defense.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aRNA interference 3aSciaenops ocellatus 3abacterial infections 3ablood 3acomplementary DNA 3afish 3aguanosinetriphosphatase 3ahepatocytes 3ahumans 3aimmune response 3akidneys 3alipopolysaccharides 3aliver 3amice 3amuscles 3aopen reading frames 3aproteins 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3aspleen 3atissues1 aDeng, Tian1 aSun, Li0 tFish & shellfish immunology.g2011 Dec., v. 31, no. 6 p.1005-1012dElsevier Ltdx1050-46487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2011.08.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03080naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024003500132024004200167040001800209100001700227245010700244300001400351520138400365592002801749596006601777650001301843650002201856650002301878650001201901650001201913650001701925650001601942650002701958650001501985650001502000650002202015650001302037650001702050650002802067650002102095651001202116653001602128653001502144653001502159653001502174653001802189653000902207653001202216700002202228700001602250700002402266773013302290856008202423852000902505655001202514IND60547666320221122170639.0180905e201511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054766632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gsd.2015.12.0012chorus7 a10.1016/j.gsd.2015.12.0012doi7 a10.1016/j.gsd.2015.12.0012chorusOpen  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFrija, Aymen10aPerformance evaluation of groundwater management instruments: The case of irrigation sector in Tunisia  ap. 23-32.  aAround 27% of aquifers in Tunisia are being overexploited. Groundwater extractions is mainly for the irrigation sector, where more than 40% of the water used for irrigation comes from GW sources. The objective of this study is to critically review and analyze GW management instruments adopted in Tunisia during the last four decades. Evaluation of current instruments was based on a set of criteria (the impact of the instrument on increasing water productivity, reducing aquifer withdrawals, acceptability of the instrument and its implementation cost) assessed through interviews with policy makers and experts, in addition to discussions at farmers' focus groups. Results show that regulatory instruments are widely used but weakly enforced, which can explain their limited impact. To be more effective, economic instruments need a better vertical interplay between different stakeholders. Analysis of stakeholders’ participation shows limited awareness by farmers and a lack of collective actions for GW management at local levels. The alignment of GW policies to other cross-sectorial policies, the enhancement of the vertical interplay between water users’ associations and local and national water administrations, and the horizontal integration of different water users and managers at the local and regional levels, are among the main recommendations of this study.  aPublisher supplied data  cEconomic Research Servicedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100009175 3aaquifers 3acollective action 3aconsumers (people) 3aexperts 3afarmers 3afocus groups 3agroundwater 3ahorizontal integration 3ainterviews 3airrigation 3aissues and policy 3amanagers 3astakeholders 3asustainable development 3awater management 3aTunisia 0aGroundwater 0aIrrigation 0aGovernance 0aRegulation 0aParticipation 0aWUAs 0aTunisia1 aDhehibi, Boubaker1 aChebil, Ali1 aVillholth, Karen G.0 tGroundwater for sustainable development.g2015 Nov.,  Dec., v. 1, no. 1-2 p.23-32dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23351x2352-801X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gsd.2015.12.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02440naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003600135040001800171100001800189245006100207300001600268506007600284520100500360592002801365506003701393650001501430650001701445650000901462650001701471650001201488650001101500650001601511650001201527650001801539650002901557650001501586650001501601650002901616650001201645650002301657650002601680650003401706700001901740700001601759773008001775856008201855852000901937655001201946IND60092519820221207112152.0141103e20110204xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009251982DNAL7 a212957012pmid7 aPMC30480342pmcid7 a10.1016/j.cell.2011.01.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMinc, Nicolas10aInfluence of Cell Geometry on Division-Plane Positioning  ap. 414-426.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe spatial organization of cells depends on their ability to sense their own shape and size. Here, we investigate how cell shape affects the positioning of the nucleus, spindle and subsequent cell division plane. To manipulate geometrical parameters in a systematic manner, we place individual sea urchin eggs into microfabricated chambers of defined geometry (e.g., triangles, rectangles, and ellipses). In each shape, the nucleus is positioned at the center of mass and is stretched by microtubules along an axis maintained through mitosis and predictive of the future division plane. We develop a simple computational model that posits that microtubules sense cell geometry by probing cellular space and orient the nucleus by exerting pulling forces that scale to microtubule length. This model quantitatively predicts division-axis orientation probability for a wide variety of cell shapes, even in multicellular contexts, and estimates scaling exponents for length-dependent microtubule forces.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEchinoidea 3acell nucleus 3aeggs 3amicrotubules 3amitosis 3amodels 3aprobability 2aAnimals 2aCell Division 2aCell Nucleusxmetabolism 2aCell Shape 2aInterphase 2aMicrotubulesxmetabolism 2aMitosis 2aModels, Biological 2aSea Urchinsxcytology 2aSpindle Apparatusxmetabolism1 aBurgess, David1 aChang, Fred0 tCell.g2011 Feb. 4, v. 144, no. 3 p.414-426dElsevier Inc.x0092-86747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2011.01.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02475naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100002200156245012500178500002200303520127300325592002801598650001701626650001001643650002001653650001001673650002601683650001901709650001801728650001101746653001601757653001901773653001801792653002001810700001801830700002001848700002101868700002001889773005701909856009001966852000902056655001202065IND60586974320221119205023.0171214s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058697432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2017.11.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHayashi, Koichiro10aRed blood cell-like particles with the ability to avoid lung and spleen accumulation for the treatment of liver fibrosis  aPre-press version  aMicro-sized drug-carrier particles accumulate mainly in the lungs and nano-sized particles tend to accumulate in the liver and spleen. Here, we show that micro-particles designed to mimic red blood cells (RBCs) can overcome these limitations. The RBC-MPs created in this study have a unique intra-particle elasticity distribution (IED), enabling them to bend around the central axis of the RBC-like dent, enabling them to pass through pores smaller than their diameter, mechanically behaving as authentic RBCs. In contrast, spherical MPs (SPH-MPs) and RBC-MPs hardened by incorporating a siloxane network (SiO2-RBC-MPs), could not. In addition to the IED, we discovered that the deformability also depends on the shape and average particle elasticity. RBC-MPs did not accumulate in the lungs and the spleen, but were targeted specifically to the liver instead. In contrast, non-RBC-MPs such as SPH-MPs and SiO2-RBC-MPs showed heavy accumulation in the lungs and/or spleen, and were dispersed non-specifically in various organs. Thus, controlling the shape and mechanical properties of RBC-MPs is important for achieving the desired biodistribution. When RBC-MPs were loaded with a (TGF)-β receptor inhibitor, RBC-MPs could treat liver fibrosis without pneumotoxicity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aerythrocytes 3aliver 3aliver cirrhosis 3alungs 3amechanical properties 3amicroparticles 3ananoparticles 3aspleen 0aBiomimetics 0aLiver fibrosis 0aDrug delivery 0aBiodistribution1 aYamada, Shota1 aHayashi, Hikaru1 aSakamoto, Wataru1 aYogo, Toshinobu0 tBiomaterials.g2017, dElsevier Ltdx0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2017.11.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02270naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245011100175300001600286520102300302592002801325596002901353650002101382650001401403650001201417650001501429650001101444650001201455650001301467650001601480653002501496653001001521653002201531653001501553653001701568653003301585700001701618700001701635773010201652856008501754852000901839655001201848IND60748376520221117182203.0210827e20210914xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074837652DNAL7 a10.1080/17597269.2018.15588392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEdeh, Ifeanyichukwu10aOptimization of subcritical water-mediated lipid extraction from activated sludge for biodiesel production  ap. 905-911.  aThe search for a cheap and readily available feedstock for biodiesel production has driven researchers to investigate the potential use of activated sludge-derived lipid. Due to the low lipid yield of activated sludge, the utility of subcritical water (SCW) is being considered as a means of increasing the extractable lipids. In this work, operating parameters (temperature, time and biomass loading) identified in our previous work to influence lipid yield from activated sludge under SCW treatment were optimized, using face-centered central composite design (FCCCD). The results show that the maximum lipid yield obtained from the liquid and solid products, post SCW treatment, at the optimum conditions of temperature 80 °C, extraction time 20 min and biomass loading 1%, was 41.0 (wt./wt.)%. This gives approximately 454 (wt./wt.)% increase from 7.4 (wt./wt.)% obtained by solvent extraction without SCW treatment. The results suggest that activated sludge is a potential feedstock for biodiesel production.  aPublisher supplied data  aPTDF/E/OSS/PHD/EI/533/12 3aactivated sludge 3abiodiesel 3abiomass 3afeedstocks 3alipids 3aliquids 3asolvents 3atemperature 0aDesign of experiment 0alipid 0asubcritical water 0aextraction 0aoptimization 0aresponse surface methodology1 aOverton, Tim1 aBowra, Steve0 tBiofuels.g2021 Sept. 14, v. 12, no. 8 p.905-911dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2219x1759-72777nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17597269.2018.15588393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02435naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005400147245008800201500002200289520112200311592002801433650000901461650001501470650003401485650001701519650001301536650001201549650001801561650001301579650001601592651001001608653003501618653002201653653001601675653002201691653002401713700001701737700005701754773011101811856008201922852000902004655001202013IND60793966420221120190615.0220929e20220913xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079396642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jes.2022.09.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLyu, Xiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0867-324810aPre-combustion mercury removal with co-production of hydrogen via coal electrolysis  aPre-press version  aPre-combustion mercury removal via coal electrolysis was performed and investigated on a bench-scale coal electrolytic cell (CEC) systemically, and factorial design was used to determine the effect of different operating conditions (coal particle size, operating temperature, operating cell voltage, and flow rate of slurry) on the percentage of mercury removal, percentage of ash removal, and dry heating value change. The results showed that the operating cell voltage, as well as the interaction between operating cell voltage and coal particle size, are significant factors in the percentage of mercury removal. There is no significant factor in the percentage of ash removal and the dry heating value change, but the coal could be purified while keeping the dry heating value almost constant after electrolysis. A co-product of hydrogen could be produced during coal electrolysis with 50% lower energy consumption compared with water electrolysis. Meanwhile, a mechanism for mercury removal in coal was proposed. The facts indicate that coal electrolysis is a promising method for pre-combustion mercury removal.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoal 3acoproducts 3aelectric potential difference 3aelectrolysis 3ahydrogen 3amercury 3aparticle size 3aslurries 3atemperature 3aChina 0aPre-combustion mercury removal 0aCoal electrolysis 0aAsh removal 0aDry heating value 0aHydrogen production1 aTao, Runming1 aZhang, Tianyu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6501-75620 tJournal of environmental sciences (China).g2022 Sept. 13, dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12417x1001-07427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jes.2022.09.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02540naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245010800174300001600282500001900298520139100317592002801708650001501736650001201751650001701763650001901780650001101799650001201810650002001822650001301842650001501855653001701870700001701887700003301904700002301937773010001960856008502060852000902145655001202154IND60741442220221119005244.0210615e20210703xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074144222DNAL7 a10.1080/17597269.2018.15464872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNdlovu, Kudakwashe12aA direct gasoline pre-blending of bioalcohol mixtures as a means of decreasing separation energy losses  ap. 615-623.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aTransport emissions account for around a quarter of all CO₂ emissions and so, automotive fuels are a key area of research for combating climate change. Widespread adoption of bio-ethanol fuel blends has been the first step in this direction. However, the economic and environmental viability of bio-ethanol usage is hampered by inefficiencies in its production, resulting in a need for significant improvements. The gasoline pre-blending method is a recent advancement that shows great promise in minimizing the separation energy required for bio-ethanol recovery by circumventing full purification and using gasoline’s phase equilibrium properties to eliminate water from a partially purified fermentation product. This paper models all possible gasoline pre-blending processes incorporating ethanol, butanol or both. It is found that butanol is highly suitable for gasoline pre-blending and that high recovery can be achieved even when starting with dilute concentrations. In addition, the presence of even small amounts of butanol is effective at drawing ethanol into the fuel phase, improving the overall alcohol recovery. Energy savings of up to 19% have been shown using a case study while a graphical methodology for preliminary design and synthesis of any gasoline pre-blending process has been developed, allowing for rapid flowsheet development and performance prediction.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioethanol 3abutanol 3acase studies 3aclimate change 3aenergy 3aethanol 3afermented foods 3agasoline 3aprediction 0apre-blending1 aStacey, Neil1 aFernández-Torres, María J.1 aHildebrandt, Diane0 tBiofuels.g2021 July 3, v. 12, no. 6 p.615-623dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2219x1759-72777nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17597269.2018.15464873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03154naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001300156245012700169500002200296520150700318592002801825650001201853650002101865650002201886650001201908650001401920650002301934650002601957650001701983650001202000650001502012650001102027650001702038650001402055650000702069650002402076650001402100653004302114653002202157653003802179653003502217653001702252700001502269700001602284700001902300700001802319700001502337700001802352700001702370700001602387700001702403773005702420856009002477852000902567655001202576IND60586974520221119203305.0171214s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058697452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2017.11.0382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Yu10aOne-pot synthesis of pH-responsive charge-switchable PEGylated nanoscale coordination polymers for improved cancer therapy  aPre-press version  aNanoscale coordination polymers (NCPs) are promising nanomedicine platforms featured with biodegradability and versatile functionalities. However, multi-step post-synthesis surface modification is usually required to functionalize as-made NCPs before their biomedical applications. Moreover, efforts are still required to design therapeutic NCPs responsive to the unique tumor microenvironment to achieve more specific and effective therapy. Herein, we uncover a simple yet general strategy to synthesize a series of polyethylene glycol (PEG) modified NCPs via a one-step method by adding poly-histidine-PEG co-polymer into the mixture of metal ions and organic ligands during NCPs formation. With NCPs consisting Ca2+/dicarboxylic cisplatin (IV) prodrug as the example, we show that such Ca/Pt(IV)@pHis-PEG NCPs are highly sensitive to pH changes. With slightly negative charges and compact structure under pH 7.4 during blood circulation, those NCPs exhibit efficient passive accumulation in the tumor, in which the reduced pH (c.a. 6.5) would trigger charge conversion and size expansion to enhance their tumor retention and cell internationalization. After cellular uptake, NCPs within cell endo-/lysosomes with further reduced pH would then lead to decomposition of those NCPs and thus drug release. Chemotherapy with Ca/Pt(IV)@pHis-PEG NCPs in our animal tumor model demonstrates great efficacy under low drug doses, and is found to be particularly effective towards solid tumors with reduced pH.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimals 3abiodegradability 3ablood circulation 3acalcium 3acisplatin 3acomposite polymers 3acoordination polymers 3adrug therapy 3aligands 3ametal ions 3amodels 3ananomedicine 3aneoplasms 3apH 3apolyethylene glycol 3asynthesis 0aNanoscale coordination polymers (NCPs) 0aOne-pot synthesis 0aCarrier-free drug delivery system 0apH-responsive charge-switching 0aChemotherapy1 aXu, Ligeng1 aZhu, Wenjun1 aFeng, Liangzhu1 aLiu, Jingjing1 aChen, Qian1 aDong, Ziliang1 aZhao, Jiayue1 aLiu, Zhuang1 aChen, Meiwan0 tBiomaterials.g2017, dElsevier Ltdx0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2017.11.0383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02535naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245010800169300001600277520091300293536030801206592002801514650002301542650000901565650001001574650001301584650001701597650000801614650000901622653001101631653002301642653001501665653002601680653001301706653000901719700002601728700002501754700002101779700002101800700001901821700002101840773012201861856008501983852000902068655001202077IND60626052520221119140537.0181214e20190102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062605252DNAL7 a10.1080/15440478.2017.14085212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShabbir, Mohd10aLight Fastness and Shade Variability of Tannin Colorant Dyed Wool with the Effect of Mordanting Methods  ap. 100-113.  aMordanting methods effect on color characteristics and fastness properties, particularly light fastness were evaluated in this study. Effect of metal mordants and their combinations on wool dyeing with Terminalia chebula natural dye were investigated and correlation between dye structures, effect of metal mordant and mordanting methods were established. Results reveal that T. chebula can be used as yellow dye with or without metal mordants to get a variable range of shades on wool with good color strength and fastness properties, and appreciable shade variations with mordanting methods observed. Color performances of dyed substrate indicated substantial improvement in depth of shades and color fastness in case of mordanted samples. Pre-mordanting with tin and post-mordanting with alum proved to be most effective for increasing K/S values of the dyed substrate under the optimum dyeing conditions.  aUniversity Grants Commission, Govt. of India; New Delhi is thankfully acknowledged for financial support provided through BSR Research Fellowship in Science for Meritorious Students (Mohd Shabbir, Luqman Jameel Rather and Shahid-ul-Islam) and Non-Net fellowship for Ph.D. students (Mohd Nadeem Bukhari).  aPublisher supplied data 3aTerminalia chebula 3aalum 3acolor 3amordants 3anatural dyes 3atin 3awool 0aDyeing 0aTerminalia chebula 0amordanting 0acolor characteristics 0afastness 0awool1 aRather, Luqman Jameel1 aBukhari, Mohd Nadeem1 aUl-Islam, Shahid1 aShahid, Mohammad1 aKhan, Mohd Ali1 aMohammad, Faqeer0 tJournal of natural fibers.g2019 Jan. 2, v. 16, no. 1 p.100-113dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl946540x1544-046X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15440478.2017.14085213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03395naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006300150245012500213300001400338520178400352592002802136650001202164650001102176650002902187650001402216650001002230650001002240650002402250650002602274650001902300650001102319650002302330650001502353650001102368650001102379650001402390650003502404650002402439650002102463650002202484651001102506653001002517653002502527653002602552653001302578700002002591700002302611700002002634773010502654856008502759852000902844655001202853IND60605648920221121004121.0190215e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060564892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocon.2015.12.0362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEterovick, Paula C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1316-125510aIsolated frogs in a crowded world: Effects of human-caused habitat loss on frog heterozygosity and fluctuating asymmetry  ap. 52-59.  aIt is important to develop research methods that will detect deterioration in population health before severe declines occur. Amphibian population declines are widespread; the main causes are anthropogenic and include habitat fragmentation due to agriculture, mining, fires, and urban development. Brazil is the richest country in species of amphibians, and the Brazilian regions with the greatest amphibian diversity are experiencing relatively high rates of habitat destruction. We tested the use of measurements of fluctuating asymmetry (FA) taken on adult frogs, as well as heterozygosity estimates in frog populations, to detect anthropogenic stress. We hypothesized that greater human occupancy in the landscape might result in more stressful conditions for amphibians, which would be reflected in high FA levels and/or reduced heterozygosity. We conducted this study at the Espinhaço mountain range in southeastern Brazil, using an endemic species (Bokermannohyla saxicola, Hylidae) as a model. We found that adult frog FA levels differed among localities but did not find significant correlations between human modification of the landscape and FA levels. In the subsample of localities for which we had genetic data, heterozygosity was significantly inversely correlated with FA in adult frogs, and heterozygosity decreased with increasing human occupancy in the landscape, except for populations with marginal distribution within the species range that already had very low heterozygosity. Our major finding was that reduced heterozygosity may be caused by population isolation resulting from human occupancy (among other causes) and is correlated with increased fluctuating asymmetry, so that either may indicate higher levels of stress in populations of B. saxicola.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHylidae 3aadults 3aanthropogenic activities 3aasymmetry 3afires 3afrogs 3ahabitat destruction 3ahabitat fragmentation 3aheterozygosity 3ahumans 3aindigenous species 3alandscapes 3amining 3amodels 3amountains 3anatural resources conservation 3apopulation dynamics 3aresearch methods 3aurban development 3aBrazil 0aAnura 0aDevelopmental stress 0aAnthropogenic impacts 0aLand use1 aSloss, Brian L.1 aScalzo, José A.M.1 aAlford, Ross A.0 tBiological conservation.g2016 Mar., v. 195 p.52-59dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl44607x0006-32077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2015.12.0363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03079naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245013300162300001800295520153900313592002801852650001201880650001801892650001301910650001301923650001201936650001501948650001601963650003001979650001402009650001202023650001502035650002002050650002202070650001602092650001702108650002602125650002602151650001402177650001302191650001802204650000902222650003102231650002002262700002202282700002102304700001802325773011602343856008102459852000902540655001202549IND60120867220221120051840.0150212e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012086722DNAL7 a10.1007/s00216-013-6882-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNaz, Shama10aMethod development and validation for rat serum fingerprinting with CE–MS: application to ventilator-induced-lung-injury study  ap. 4849-4858.  aIn the search for a noninvasive and reliable rapid screening method to detect biomarkers, a metabolomics fingerprinting approach was developed and applied to rat serum samples using capillary electrophoresis coupled to an electrospray ionization-time of flight-mass spectrometer (CE–TOF-MS). An ultrafiltration method was used for sample pretreatment. To evaluate performance the method was validated with carnitine, choline, ornithine, alanine, acetylcarnitine, betaine, and citrulline, covering the entire electropherogram of pool of rat serum. The linearity for all metabolites was >0.99, with good recovery and precision. Approximately 34 compounds were also confirmed in the pool of rat serum. The method was successfully applied to real serum samples from rats with ventilator-induced lung injury, an experimental rat model for acute lung injury (ALI), giving a total of 1163 molecular features. By use of univariate and multivariate statistics 18 significant compounds were found, of which five were confirmed. The involvement of arginase and nitric oxide synthase has been proved for other lung diseases, meaning the increase of asymmetric dimethyl arginine (ADMA) and ornithine and the decrease of arginine found were in accordance with published literature. Ultimately this fingerprinting approach offers the possibility of identifying biomarkers that could be regularly screened for as part of routine disease control. In this way it might be possible to prevent the development of ALI in patients in critical care units.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalanine 3aanimal models 3aarginase 3aarginine 3abetaine 3abiomarkers 3ablood serum 3acapillary electrophoresis 3acarnitine 3acholine 3acitrulline 3adisease control 3amass spectrometry 3ametabolites 3ametabolomics 3amultivariate analysis 3anitric oxide synthase 3aornithine 3apatients 3arapid methods 3arats 3arespiratory tract diseases 3aultrafiltration1 aGarcía, Antonia,1 aRusak, Magdalena1 aBarbas, Coral0 tAnalytical and bioanalytical chemistry.g2013 May, v. 405, no. 14 p.4849-4858dSpringer-Verlagx1618-26427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00216-013-6882-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02519naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100002800156245014700184500002200331520125800353592002801611650001901639650001201658650002301670650001801693650002201711650002601733650001701759653001001776653002101786653002701807653001201834653002201846653002801868653002301896700001501919700001901934773005701953856009002010852000902100655001202109IND60586974620221119202957.0171214s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058697462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2017.11.0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeneksedag Erol, Deniz,10aMechanistic insights into the role of glycosaminoglycans in delivery of polymeric nucleic acid nanoparticles by molecular dynamics simulations  aPre-press version  aDelivery of polynucleotide-based therapeutics into target cells involves interactions with glycosaminoglycan chains that are located on cell membrane milieu. Mechanisms governing glycosaminoglycan-mediated changes in the nanoparticulate structures of polymer-polynucleotide complexes are unknown, and cannot be fully elucidated without atomistic level details of molecular interactions. We selected a representative nanoparticulate system consisting of a short interfering RNA (siRNA)-polyethylenimine complex, and performed all-atom molecular dynamics simulations with the prototypical glycosaminoglycan heparin. We monitored the binding between the complex constituents and the heparin, and identified key features contributing to the response of the siRNA nanoparticles to heparin. We observed three main metastable states that the siRNA nanoparticles might visit in the presence of heparin, which can be translated into different functional outcomes. By correlating our data with the widely different and seemingly contradictory roles previously assigned to glycosaminoglycans, this study provides unique insights into the discrepancies in the experimental literature concerning the role of glycosaminoglycans in the polymeric nanoparticle delivery.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell membranes 3aheparin 3amolecular dynamics 3ananoparticles 3asimulation models 3asmall interfering RNA 3atherapeutics 0asiRNA 0aPolyethylenimine 0aPolymeric nanoparticle 0aHeparin 0aGlycosaminoglycan 0aPolynucleotide delivery 0aMolecular dynamics1 aTang, Tian1 aUludağ, Hasan0 tBiomaterials.g2017, dElsevier Ltdx0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2017.11.0373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03185naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100004000154245008800194300001600282520156400298592002801862650002001890650004401910650001501954650002301969650001201992650001002004650001102014650001102025650001802036650001902054650001202073650003302085650001902118650001502137650002102152650002602173650001502199653002602214653001802240653002402258653001502282700002302297700003702320700002202357700003302379700002202412773012302434856008902557852000902646655001202655IND60553764520221122100641.0190410e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055376452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2016.08.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGutiérrez-Hernández, José Manuel10aUse of Agave tequilana-lignin and zinc oxide nanoparticles for skin photoprotection  ap. 156-161.  aThe use of sunscreens is essential for preventing skin damage and the potential appearance of skin cancer in humans. Inorganic active components such as zinc oxide (ZnO) have been used commonly in sunscreens due to their ability to block UVA radiation. This ultraviolet (UV) protection might be enhanced to cover the UVB and UVC bands when combined with other components such as titanium dioxide (TiO2). In this work we evaluate the photoprotection properties of organic nanoparticles made from lignin in combination with ZnO nanoparticles as active ingredients for sunscreens. Lignin nanoparticles were synthesized from Agave tequilana lignin. Two different pulping methods were used for dissolving lignin from agave bagasse. ZnO nanoparticles were synthesized by the precipitation method. All nanoparticles were characterized by SEM, UV–Vis and FT-IR spectroscopy. Nanoparticles were mixed with a neutral vehicle in different concentrations and in-vitro sun protection factor (SPF) values were calculated. Different sizes of spherical lignin nanoparticles were obtained from the spent liquors of two different pulping methods. ZnO nanoparticles resulted with a flake shape. The mixture of all components gave SPF values in a range between 4 and 13. Lignin nanoparticles showed absorption in the UVB and UVC regions which can enhance the SPF value of sunscreens composed only of zinc oxide nanoparticles. Lignin nanoparticles have the added advantage of being of organic nature and its brown color can be used to match the skin tone of the person using it.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgave tequilana 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aabsorption 3aactive ingredients 3abagasse 3acolor 3ahumans 3alignin 3ananoparticles 3aphotostability 3apulping 3ascanning electron microscopy 3askin neoplasms 3asunscreens 3atitanium dioxide 3aultraviolet radiation 3azinc oxide 0aSuncare/UV protection 0aNanoparticles 0aUV/VIS spectroscopy 0aSunscreens1 aEscalante, Alfredo1 aMurillo-Vázquez, Raquel Nalleli1 aDelgado, Ezequiel1 aGonzález, Francisco Javier,1 aToríz, Guillermo0 tJournal of photochemistry and photobiology.g2016 Oct., v. 163 p.156-161dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6193x1011-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2016.08.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03634naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004600094040001800140100002600158245008600184300001600270520212700286592002802413650001502441650001502456650001202471650001902483650002502502650002402527650001802551650001102569650002102580650001202601650000902613650001402622650002202636650000902658650001002667650001702677650001102694650001502705650001902720650001602739650001902755653001402774653001502788653001602803653001502819653000902834653001502843700001802858773010202876856009302978852000903071655001203080IND60647441320221121052016.0190705e20190901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064744132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.theriogenology.2019.06.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBondarenko, Volodymyr10aStructure and beating behavior of the sperm motility apparatus in aquatic animals  ap. 152-163.  aMotility is a characteristic function of the male gamete, which allows spermatozoa to actively reach and penetrate the female gamete in organisms with internal and external fertilization. Sperm motility is acquired under the control of many extrinsic and intrinsic factors and is based on a specialized structure of the sperm flagellum called “axoneme”. An overview of how the sperm flagellum is organized, and it operates to support cell motility is presented, with special focus on the molecular mechanisms and factors involved in the development, maintenance and control of motility. Data obtained in aquatic organisms with external fertilization, such as sea urchins, ascidians or fishes are critically analyzed because they constitute model species on which most of the present day understanding of sperm motility function is based. In most animal species, sperm motility is dependent on a long appendage called flagellum. Flagella are essential organelles found in most eukaryotic cells; their basic structure is the axoneme, which consists of a scaffold of microtubules and is responsible for movement in an autonomous manner if ATP-energy is present. Flagellar beat propels the cell through the medium which surrounds sperm cells and is responsible of the translational drive of spermatozoa. The present paper includes: (1) an introduction to typical sperm morphology and ultrastructure in most aquatic species, (2) the motility apparatus or axoneme of the spermatozoa: the axoneme, (3) the structural and biochemical composition of the axoneme, (4) the axonemal motor or dynein, and its operation, (5) the regulation of motility at axoneme and cell membrane levels, including several effectors such as Ca2+ ions, (6) biophysical features of the wave propagation mechanism in motile spermatozoa, (7) the energy production and consumption, and (8) the building of a flagellum. Flagellar beating in aquatic animals is illustrated using several examples in figures and video-clips. These types of data are also used for computer simulation of various aspects of the modulation of sperm motility of marine animals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAscidiacea 3aEchinoidea 3acalcium 3acell membranes 3achemical composition 3acomputer simulation 3adynein ATPase 3aenergy 3aeukaryotic cells 3afemales 3afish 3aflagellum 3aintrinsic factors 3aions 3amales 3amicrotubules 3amodels 3aorganelles 3asperm motility 3aspermatozoa 3aultrastructure 0aFlagellum 0aSea urchin 0aSpermatozoa 0aRegulation 0aIons 0aOsmolarity1 aCosson, Jacky0 tTheriogenology.g2019 Sept. 01, v. 135 p.152-163dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl5209x0093-691X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2019.06.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03991naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245006400167300001400231520246900245592002802714650002502742650001902767650002502786650002702811650001802838650001602856650001202872650001602884650000902900650001802909650001402927650002002941650001002961650001502971650002402986650002703010650001803037650000903055653001503064653002703079653002003106653002503126700001903151700002203170700002003192700001603212700001603228773011403244856008203358852000903440655001203449IND60480900120210510000000.0210510e20111001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048090012DNAL7 a10.2478/v10298-012-0035-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRuginosu, Elena14aThe biochemical profile in cows with reproductive disorders  ap. 75-86.  aStudies have been conducted in the Dancu Research and Development Station for Cattle Breeding, Iași County, dairy farm, on Romanian Frisean (BNR) cows. Investigations on the biochemical profile were made in cows with reproductive disorders and in clinically healthy cows at different stages of lactation. There were made groups of 10 cows: four experimental groups of cows with puerperal genital infections (E1), cows with chronic genital infections (E2), postpartum anestrus cows (E3), cows with repeated matings (E4) and three control groups of cows in lactation stage: early, 0-2 months (M1), advanced, 4-6 months, (M2) and late, 6-7 months (M3). Results showed some biochemical changes in relation to the type of reproductive disorders and the stage of lactation: in cows with puerperal genital infections (group E1), compared with M1 group, have been found elevated mean values of serum globulin (62.70 %) and serum enzymes - ALT (45.50 ± 0.2 U / l) and values below the species inferior limit of serum enzymes - AP (7.19 ± 2.2 U / l) and of phosphatemia. In cows with chronic genital infections (group E2), compared with M2 group, the biochemical prophile showed low levels of total serum protein (6.30 ± 0.64 to 9.14 ± 0.5 g / dl) (p <0.05), of serum urea (16.00 ± 0.3 mg / dl), alkaline reserve, calcium (8.9 ± 0.10, respectively, 11.42 ± 2.10 mg / dl) and of serum enzymes - AST, GGT and AP, indicating some liver and calciumphosphorus metabolism disorders, and elevated values to the species upper limit, in terms of cholesterol and serum enzymes - ALT. In cows with postpartum anestrus (E3 group), compared with cows in M2 group were found slightly higher average values of serum albumin (45.55 ± 0.4 to 40.0 ± 1.5), mean values that are above the species upper limit for the serum enzymes - ALT and low average values to the lower limit for serum urea, alkaline reserve, alkalin phosphatase and Ca/P ratio. In cows with repeated matings (E4 group), compared with M2 and M3 groups have been revealed decreased mean values of serum total protein (g/dl), (6,7±0,6 compared to 8,3±0,6, respectively 9,14±0,5), and increased values to the upper limit for serum albumin (%), (53,73±0,6 compared to 40,0±1,5, respectively 45,40±0,4), low values for serum ureea (7,3±0,2 mg/dl), blood glucose, alkaline reserve, alkaline phosphatase, calcemia, phosphatemia and increased values above the higher limit for serum enzymes - ALT (U/l) (67,4±3,6).  aPublisher supplied data 3aalanine transaminase 3aalkali reserve 3aalkaline phosphatase 3aaspartate transaminase 3ablood glucose 3ablood serum 3acalcium 3acholesterol 3acows 3adairy farming 3aglobulins 3alactation stage 3aliver 3ametabolism 3apostpartum interval 3areproductive disorders 3aserum albumin 3aurea 0aDairy cows 0aReproductive disorders 0aLactation stage 0aBiochemical profile.1 aCreangă, Şt.1 aSofronie, Mariana1 aMălăncuş, R.1 aBoghian, V.1 aSolcan, Gh.0 tCercetări agronomice în Moldova.g2011 Oct. 1, v. 44, no. 2 p.75-86dVersitawJournal:6287x2067-18657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2478/v10298-012-0035-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04089naa a2200745 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245011900176500002200295500002200317520191800339592002802257650002102285650001502306650002402321650002402345650001702369650001602386650001902402650002102421650001302442650002902455650001402484650001702498650001402515650001202529650001502541650003202556650001102588650001602599650001402615650001702629650001402646650001802660650001102678650001602689653002402705653001402729653002102743653001402764653000802778653003102786653001702817700001802834700002602852700002402878700001902902700002102921700001802942700002002960700002202980700001803002700002503020700002403045700002003069700005803089773008903147856008603236852000903322655001203331IND60609338220221120223945.0180905s2018    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060933822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.exppara.2018.07.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSultana, Sirin Salma10aSelective in vitro inhibition of Leishmania donovani by a semi-purified fraction of wild mushroom Grifola frondosa  aPre-press version  aPre-press version  aThe current study was designed to assess the anti-leishmanial effect of a semi-purified fraction of wild mushroom Grifola frondosa against Leishmania donovani, in vitro. A total of five extracts from three wild mushrooms [Grifola frondosa (family, Meripilaceae) Laetiporus sulphurous (family, Polyporaceae) and Meripilus giganteus (family, Meripilaceae) were explored for novel anti-leishmanial leads against promastigotes. The ethanol extract of G. frondosa was selected as the most efficient against L. donovani promastigotes (IC50: 93.9 μg/mL). A semi-purified fraction was obtained from an active ethanol extract of G. frondosa and found to inhibit the survival of promastigotes of L. donovani (MHOM/IN/83/AG83) significantly (IC50: 20.37 μg/mL) and it also had some effect against L. major LV39 (MRHO/Sv/59/P strain) and L. tropica WR683 (MHOM/SU/58/OD) strains at higher concentrations (IC50: 46.08 μg/mL and 53.79 μg/mL respectively). The semi-purified fraction also interfered in lipid biosynthesis, altered parasite morphology and induced apoptosis in L. donovani promastigotes. The semi-purified fraction was also effective against intracellular amastigotes in infected macrophages and enhanced the release of nitric oxide and pro-inflammatory cytokines, in vitro. Interestingly, the 50% inhibitory concentration of the semi-purified fraction against the intracellular amastigotes (IC50: 2.48 μg/mL) was much lower in comparison to promastigotes (IC50: 20.37 μg/mL). The semi-purified fraction was found to inhibit the intracellular amastigotes slightly more efficiently in comparison to conventional anti-leishmanial drugs; sodium antimony gluconate, amphotericin B, miltefosine and paromomycin and noticeably non-toxic towards host splenocytes. The findings of the present study established that G. frondosa might be a natural resource for development of a new anti-leishmanial lead.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGrifola frondosa 3aLaetiporus 3aLeishmania donovani 3aMeripilus giganteus 3aPolyporaceae 3aamastigotes 3aamphotericin B 3aantileishmanials 3aantimony 3aantiprotozoal properties 3aapoptosis 3abiosynthesis 3acytokines 3aethanol 3agluconates 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3alipids 3amacrophages 3amushrooms 3anitric oxide 3aparasites 3apromastigotes 3asodium 3asplenocytes 0aLeishmania donovani 0aMushrooms 0aGrifola frondosa 0aApoptosis 0aROS 0aPro-inflammatory cytokines 0aNitric oxide1 aGhosh, Joydip1 aChakraborty, Sondipon1 aMukherjee, Debarati1 aDey, Somaditya1 aMallick, Suvadip1 aDutta, Aritri1 aPaloi, Soumitra1 aKhatua, Somanjana1 aDutta, Tanmoy1 aBhattacharya, Soumen1 aAcharya, Krishnendu1 aGhorai, Narayan1 aPal, Chiranjib1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0724-52920 tExperimental parasitology.g2018, dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45466x0014-48947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.exppara.2018.07.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02369naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004000113040001800153100002000171245013100191300001800322520099600340592002801336650001601364650001001380650002401390650002201414650002901436650004301465650003001508650002701538653002101565653000901586653002501595653001601620653001701636700001801653700001901671700001901690700002101709773010901730856008701839852000901926655001201935IND50068896520221118233218.0190402e20131215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006889652DNAL7 a239935192pmid7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2013.06.0692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSampietro, D.A.10aDevelopment and validation of a micromethod for fast quantification of 5-n-alkylresorcinols in grains and whole grain products  ap. 3546-3551.  aA 96-well plate micromethod was developed to measure 5-n-alkylresorcinols (5nARs) in cereal grains and food derived products. The 5nARs reacted in alkaline alcoholic medium with Fast Blue RR ½ZnCl2 salt to yield coloured azo-derivatives. The highest sensitivity for 5nARs was obtained at 490nm with 0.025% ethanolic Fast Blue RR and 5% K2CO3. This reaction showed good linearity for olivetol (0.05–0.20μg). Contents of 5nARs determined in cereal grains and derived products by the new Fast Blue RR micromethod were highly correlated (R2=0.9944) with those obtained by a Fast Blue B method currently used. A Bland–Altman analysis indicated a small positive bias near to zero (R2=0.0401), suggesting that the methods can be interchangeably used. The new reaction is completed in 15min and the coloured products are read within the 15min after completion.

The present study examined the survival of Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella Typhimurium, Vibrio parahaemoliticus, Listeria monocytogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus in raw RTE crab marinated in soy sauce. Inoculated crabs (initial bacterial population=4.1–4.4logCFU/g) were immersed in soy sauce and then stored at refrigeration (5°C) or room temperature (22°C) for up to 28days. At 5°C, all bacteria (except V. parahaemolyticus) survived in crab samples until Day 28 (counts of 1.4, 1.6, 3.1, 3.2 log CFU/g for E. coli O157:H7, S. Typhimurium, L. monocytogenes, and S. aureus, respectively). However, at 22°C, all tested bacteria were more susceptible to the antimicrobial effects of marination. Regardless of temperature, foodborne pathogens attached to crab samples were more resistant to marination than those suspended in soy sauce samples; however, the survival pattern for each species was different. Gram-positive bacteria were most resistant to marination conditions (high salinity, low pH), whereas V. parahaemolyticus was extremely susceptible. Marination is the only antibacterial step in the manufacturing processes; however, the results presented herein reveal that this is not sufficient to inactivate foodborne pathogens. In particular, the survival of pathogens on crabs at refrigeration temperature may pose a major hazard for the consumption of raw RTE seafood. Thus, appropriate decontamination methods and implementation of safety management practices are needed. This study provides predictive microbiological information of foodborne pathogens in raw RTE seafood with marination.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli O157 3aGram-positive bacteria 3aListeria monocytogenes 3aSalmonella Typhimurium 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aVibrio parahaemolyticus 3aambient temperature 3aanti-infective properties 3abiological hazards 3acrabs 3adecontamination 3afood pathogens 3amanufacturing 3amarinating 3apH 3aprediction 3aready-to-eat foods 3arefrigeration 3asalinity 3aseafoods 3asoy sauce 0aGanjang-gejang 0aRaw ready-to-eat seafood 0aSoy sauce 0aMarination 0aBacterial survival1 aKim, N.H.1 aKim, S.A.1 aSong, J.H.1 aRhee, M.S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0412-19100 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2016 Dec. 05, v. 238 p.50-55dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl35565x0168-16057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2016.08.0413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02887naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245016600170300001400336520133100350592002801681650002301709650001501732650002901747650001201776650000901788650001701797650001901814650003401833650001701867650003501884650001201919650001601931650001501947650001201962650001001974653001601984653001602000653002302016653001202039653001302051700001602064700002102080700002102101700002102122700002102143773011402164856008202278852000902360655001202369IND60480900220210510000000.0210510e20111001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048090022DNAL7 a10.2478/v10298-012-0036-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHorhogea, Cristina10aIdentification of coronaviral antibodies and coronavirus - specific antibody complexes in ascites fluid of cats diagnosticated with feline infectious peritonitis  ap. 87-93.  aFeline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is an infectious lethal cat diseases, prodused by a mutant feline coronavirus (feline infectious peritonitis virus), which is manifested in two clinical forms. Dry form may go unnoticed or be confused with other diseases. Wet form, however, evolve with ascites fluid accumulation, its appearance being correlated with end-stage of the disease. Research has pursued the efficiency of direct immunofluorescence test for the identification of coronavirus - anticoronavirus antibody complexes in ascites fluid. Nine ascites fluid samples, obtained from cats aged between 1,7 months and 13 years, diagnosed with feline infectious peritonitis, were analyzed. The antibody titrers were assessed using indirect immunofluorescence on pig kidney (PK) cell cultures infected with TGEV, on three samples, titres ranging from 1/25 and 1/625. All nine ascites fluid samples tested by direct immunofluorescence for detection of coronavirus specific antibodies complexes were positive. In images obtained with UV in microscopy, fluorescence being seen in the macrophages under the form of a ring arranged on the periphery of the cell membrane and fluorescence localized intracellularly, probably internalized immune complexes. The results lead us to recommend the use of this test for FIP rapid diagnostic.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFeline coronavirus 3aantibodies 3aantigen-antibody complex 3aascites 3acats 3acell culture 3acell membranes 3afeline infectious peritonitis 3afluorescence 3afluorescent antibody technique 3akidneys 3amacrophages 3amicroscopy 3amutants 3aswine 0aCoronavirus 0aPeritonitis 0aImmunofluorescence 0aAscites 0aComplex.1 aLaiu, Ivona1 aLe Poder, Sophie1 aCarp-Cărare, M.1 aRîmbu, Cristina1 aCarp-Cărare, C.0 tCercetări agronomice în Moldova.g2011 Oct. 1, v. 44, no. 2 p.87-93dVersitawJournal:6287x2067-18657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2478/v10298-012-0036-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03165naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245009400169300001600263520197000279592002802249650001302277650001602290650001502306650001102321650002102332650000902353650001002362650001602372653003102388653002902419653001602448653001702464653002502481700002002506700001602526700001702542773010202559856008502661852000902746655001202755IND60748377020221120024318.0210827e20210914xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074837702DNAL7 a10.1080/17597269.2018.15644792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUllah, Saleem10aOrganics in soda-anthraquinone black liquors from hot-water-extracted non-wood feedstocks  ap. 953-959.  aThe chemical compositions of black liquors (BLs) obtained from the soda-anthraquinone (AQ) pulping of untreated and hot-water-extracted non-wood feedstocks (okra stalk, miscanthus stalk, and wheat straw) were determined. These under-utilized renewable and widely available feedstocks could provide a cheaper source for producing fiber and precursors for manufacturing green chemicals. These BLs were mainly characterized in terms of carbohydrate-derived volatile carboxylic acids (acetic and formic acids) and non-volatile carboxylic acids (hydroxy acids) as well as lignin. Additionally, in each case, the average molar mass and molar mass distribution of the dissolved lignin were measured. Results indicated typical effects of hot-water extraction; for example, in the case of hot-water-extracted feedstocks, compared to untreated feedstocks, more aliphatic carboxylic acids were formed, whereas in both cases the removal of lignin was similar. The maximum total amounts of aliphatic carboxylic acids were in the following order: okra/150 °C/P200 (39 g L⁻¹) > miscanthus/150 °C/P200 (31 g L⁻¹) > wheat/150 °C/P200 (15 g L⁻¹). On the other hand, the total dissolved lignin was in the following order: wheat/150 °C/P200 (45 g L⁻¹) > miscanthus/150 °C/P200 (35 g L⁻¹) ≈ okra/140 °C/P50 (35 g L⁻¹). The hot-water extraction also affected weight average molar mass (w) values of the dissolved lignin in BLs. When the pre-treatment conditions became harsher, the w values increased; the lowest value detected was 4160 g mol⁻¹ for lignin in the okra BL from the untreated feedstock, and the highest value, 8730 g mol⁻¹, was obtained for lignin in the wheat BL from pre-treated feedstock (150 °C/P200). All the data obtained are of importance when planning the overall strategy for recovering the non-wood-derived aliphatic carboxylic acids and lignin formed in this kind of integrated biorefinery approach.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiofuels 3abiorefining 3afeedstocks 3alignin 3amolecular weight 3aokra 3awheat 3awheat straw 0aAliphatic carboxylic acids 0aalkaline delignification 0abiorefinery 0ablack liquor 0ahot-water extraction1 aPakkanen, Hannu1 aLehto, Joni1 aAlén, Raimo0 tBiofuels.g2021 Sept. 14, v. 12, no. 8 p.953-959dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2219x1759-72777nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17597269.2018.15644793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03720naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100006200149245012600211300001600337506011700353506007600470520169600546592002802242506003702270650001702307650002102324650001202345650002102357650002302378650002002401650002402421650003702445650001202482650001802494650001602512650001302528650001302541650003702554653002802591653001902619653001802638653002102656653001702677653001802694653001702712700002502729700006402754700002702818700007202845700006002917773008502977856008303062852000903145655001203154IND60793966820221207122926.0220929e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079396682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.sajce.2022.09.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDipheko, Tshepo D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3999-185510aEthanol dehydrogenation over (K)(Co)MoS2[sbnd]catalysts supported on activated carbon: Effect of active phase composition  ap. 290-305.  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe conversion of ethanol to synthesize various oxygenated hydrocarbons was studied over monometallic-, bimetallic-, and trimetallic-(K)(Co)MoS₂-based catalysts supported on activated carbon. The catalysts were synthesized using the incipient wetness impregnation method and sulfidized with H₂S. The catalysts were characterized by the following techniques: N₂ adsorption-desorption, UV spectroscopy of pyridine-adsorption; scanning electron microscopy (SEM); SEM energy dispersive X-ray (EDX). SEM/EDX results revealed that the active metals formed a uniform phase. Synthesized catalysts were tested in a fixed-bed tubular reactor. It was established that the addition of K and Co significantly altered the physical-chemical properties, activity and selectivity of sulfide catalysts. The addition of K decreased the catalytic activity (i.e., over KMoS₂/C and KCoMoS₂/C) relative to the reference MoS₂/C and CoMoS₂/C samples. The incorporation of a promoter atom, Co, and an alkali metal, K, inhibited ethanol dehydration (into ethene) and intermolecular dehydration (into diethyl ether). K incorporation led to the formation of active sites for higher alcohol synthesis (HAS) and other oxygenates, namely (aldol-) condensation and coupling processes, and increased the ratio of liquids to hydrocarbons. Ethanol was transformed into ethyl acetate, ethyl acetoacetate, acetaldehyde, butonal-1, propanol-1, and short-chain hydrocarbons. The acidity of the catalysts did not have a direct influence on conversion. The obtained results led us to conclude that product yields are highly dependent on the active phase composition, with ethyl acetate being the most preferred product.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aacetaldehyde 3aacetoacetic acid 3aacidity 3aactivated carbon 3acatalytic activity 3adehydrogenation 3aelectron microscopy 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3aethanol 3aethyl acetate 3aethyl ether 3aethylene 3asulfides 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 0aEthanol dehydrogenation 0aMoS2 catalysts 0aPromoter atom 0aActivated carbon 0aAlkali metal 0aEthyl acetate 0aAcetaldehyde1 aMaximov, Vladimir V.1 aPermyakov, Evgeny A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8635-20951 aOsman, Mohamed Ezeldin1 aCherednichenko, Alexander G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4709-53131 aKogan, Victor.M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3999-18550 pS.

The Esx-1 (ESAT-6 System-1) system mediates virulence factor translocation in mycobacterial pathogens, including the human pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Although several genes have been associated with Esx-1-mediated transport and virulence, the contribution of individual Esx-1 genes to export is largely undefined. A unique aspect of Esx-1 export is that several substrates require each other for export/stability. We exploited substrate “codependency” to identify Esx-1 substrates. We simultaneously quantified changes in the levels of 13 Esx-1 proteins from both secreted and cytosolic protein fractions generated from 16 Esx-1-deficient Mycobacterium marinum strains in a single experiment using MRM/SRM targeted mass spectrometry. This expansion of measurable Esx-1 proteins allowed us to define statistical rules for assigning novel substrates using phenotypic profiles of known Esx-1 substrates. Using this approach, we identified three additional Esx-1 substrates encoded by the esx-1 region. Our studies begin to address how disruption of specific genes affects several proteins in the Esx-1 complex. Overall, our findings illuminate relationships between Esx-1 proteins and create a framework for the identification of secreted substrates applicable to other protein exporters and pathways.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aMycobacterium marinum 3aMycobacterium tuberculosis 3aanimal pathogens 3acell membranes 3agenes 3amass spectrometry 3amultiprotein complexes 3aphenotype 3aprotein transport 3aproteome 3aproteomics 3avirulence 0atargeted proteomics 0asecretion 0aEsx-1 0aMycobacterium marinum 0aEsxA 0aRD1 0aMRM/SRM 0asubstrate identification1 aWilliams, Emily A.1 aPinapati, Richard S.,1 aChampion, Patricia A.

Water logging and soil salinity are the major threats to water productivity and sustainable agricultural production in the lower KRB (L-KRB). More than 78% of agricultural production in Dasht-e Azadegan region is dominated by grains, mainly wheat and barley. The main objective of this research was to determine and evaluate water productivity (WP) of irrigated wheat, as major cultivated crop in DA and recommendation of simple and applicable management guidelines. This research was conducted in fourteen farmers’fields, typical of the farms in the region, during cropping season of two years 2005-2006 and 2006-2007. Based on the total applied water, calculated Evaporation- Transpiration (ET), and crop yield, wheat water productivity values were calculated and determined. Analysis of measured Water Productivity (WP) indicated that the range of variation in WP values is relatively high and varies between 0.1-2.1 kg.m-3 In the southern parts of L-KRB, mainly in Dasht-e Azadegan plain (DA), available data show that the problem of soil salinity is magnified due to lack of farmers’ knowledge, inadequate drainage networks, and absence of improved farming practices. In general, the main cause of soil salinity in the L-KRB is high water table, usually varying between 1.2-3.0 m below the soil surface. Evaluation of results indicates that, inefficiencies and the limiting factors affecting WP in southern part of L-KRB.  aPublisher supplied data 3abarley 3abasins 3acrop yield 3adrainage 3aevapotranspiration 3afarmers 3afarming systems 3afarms 3aflooded conditions 3aguidelines 3ahigh water table 3airrigation 3aproduction technology 3arain 3asoil salinity 3asustainable agriculture 3atranspiration 3awater resources 3awatersheds 3awheat 3aIran 0aKarkheh River Basin 0aWater productivity 0aSoil salinity 0aWheat.1 aHeydari, N.1 aSedaghat, M.0 tCercetări agronomice în Moldova.g2011 Oct. 1, v. 44, no. 3 p.13-24dVersitawJournal:6287x2067-18657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2478/v10298-012-0038-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02476naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245009200172300001400264520122600278592002801504650001501532650001401547650001901561650001501580650002601595650001801621650003501639650002701674650001601701650002501717650000901742653000701751653001401758653001401772653002601786653002701812653001601839773010501855856008501960852000902045655001202054IND60605649120221120233403.0190215e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060564912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocon.2015.12.0382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFrankham, Richard10aGenetic rescue benefits persist to at least the F3 generation, based on a meta-analysis  ap. 33-36.  aMany species have isolated, inbred populations that have a high risk of extinction from inbreeding depression. While inbreeding can be reversed by outcrossing (genetic rescue), doubts have been expressed about whether fitness benefits persist beyond the F1 generation. To address this issue, I used a meta-analysis to evaluate the effects of outcrossing of inbred populations on reproductive fitness in F1, F2 and F3 (and later) generations for population crosses screened as having a low risk of outbreeding depression. Outcrossing of inbred populations was significantly beneficial compared to the inbred parent in the F1, F2 and F3 (and later) generations, with 90.5%, 100% and 94.1% of comparisons beneficial, respectively. The median benefits of outcrossing on composite fitness (combined fecundity and survival) were 42%, 84% and 86% in the F1, F2 and F3 generations, respectively, and F2 and F3 effects were not significantly different from those in the F1. Further, pre-screening to detect possible outbreeding depression was highly effective. Consequently, outcrossing can be recommended to genetically rescue inbred populations, provided the risk of outbreeding depression has been assessed and found to be low.  aPublisher supplied data 3aextinction 3afecundity 3agenetic rescue 3ainbreeding 3ainbreeding depression 3ameta-analysis 3anatural resources conservation 3aoutbreeding depression 3aoutcrossing 3areproductive fitness 3arisk 0aGR 0aGene flow 0aHeterosis 0aInbreeding depression 0aOutbreeding depression 0aOutcrossing0 tBiological conservation.g2016 Mar., v. 195 p.33-36dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl44607x0006-32077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2015.12.0383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03635naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004600094040001800140100001500158245008500173300001400258520244500272592002802717650001302745650002002758650002802778650001002806650001502816650001902831650001102850650001402861653002202875653000802897653001702905653001002922653002002932700002302952700002102975700002702996773010003023856009303123852000903216655001203225IND60647441620221121081814.0190712e20190915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064744162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.theriogenology.2019.06.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuongo, C.10aSeminal plasma mitigates the adverse effect of uterine fluid on boar spermatozoa  ap. 28-35.  aAfter natural or artificial insemination, spermatozoa start their journey within the uterus to reach the site of fertilization, but only few of them attain this goal. Part of this spermatozoa loss happens in the uterus, in which uterine fluid (UF) seems to be involved. It is known from other species that UF provokes damage to spermatozoa, which is avoided when seminal plasma (SP) is present. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of UF on the quality of ejaculated (previously contacted with SP) and epididymal (without previous contact with SP) boar spermatozoa analyzing motility, kinetic parameters, viability and acrosome integrity in the presence or absence of SP over time. Three experimental groups were evaluated in each source of spermatozoa (ejaculated and epididymal): 1) Control: spermatozoa with 20% of SP; 2) UF: spermatozoa with 20% of UF; and 3) UF-SP: spermatozoa with 20% of SP and 20% of UF. Total and progressive motility, kinetic parameters (VCL, VSL, VAP, LIN, STR, WOB, and BCF), viability and acrosome damage were analyzed at 15, 60, 120 and 180 min after incubation. Total and progressive motility decreased when ejaculated spermatozoa were incubated in UF in contrast to control and UF-SP groups (p < 0.0007), with no differences between control and UF-SP. The VCL decreased in the UF group compared to the control and UF-SP groups in ejaculated spermatozoa (p = 0.0002). The VSL, VAP, LIN and STR kinetic parameters were greater when ejaculated spermatozoa were incubated in the UF-SP group than in the UF group (all: p ≤ 0.02). Acrosome damage increased in ejaculated and epididymal spermatozoa incubated in the UF group compared to the control and UF-SP groups (both: p < 0.0001). Also, the viability of epididymal spermatozoa decreased in the UF group, while it did not change in the control and UF-SP groups (p = 0.0004). The rest of the parameters in either ejaculated or epididymal spermatozoa did not differ between experimental groups, except for WOB when epididymal spermatozoa were used (UF-SP higher than the control group, with UF being similar for both; p = 0.03). In conclusion, both ejaculated and epididymal spermatozoa are affected by UF, suggesting a negative effect on their quality. This negative effect is reduced by the presence of SP, improving the spermatozoa functionality, preserving motility, viability and acrosome integrity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacrosome 3aadverse effects 3aartificial insemination 3aboars 3aepididymis 3aseminal plasma 3auterus 3aviability 0aPorcine fertility 0aPig 0aReproduction 0aSemen 0aSperm selection1 aAbril-Sánchez, S.1 aHernández, J.G.1 aGarcía-Vázquez, F.A.0 tTheriogenology.g2019 Sept. 15, v. 136 p.28-35dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl5209x0093-691X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2019.06.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02993naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005600147245013900203300001600342520149800358592002801856596006301884596007601947596007102023650001602094650001802110650001902128650001202147650002302159650001702182650002102199650001202220650002102232650001302253650001402266650001902280700001302299700001402312700001502326773012802341856008102469852000902550655001202559IND60630448620221118111352.0190208e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063044862DNAL7 a10.1007/s12010-018-2840-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLei, Hongjie1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6234-310310aAmino Acid Supplementations Enhance the Stress Resistance and Fermentation Performance of Lager Yeast During High Gravity Fermentation  ap. 540-555.  aThe effects of different wort gravity or ethanol concentration in initial wort on the fermentation performance of lager yeast and assimilation of free amino acids (FAAs) were studied. Results showed that compared with high wort gravity (24°P), high ethanol concentration (10%, v/v) decreased yeast growth, cell viability, and wort fermentability significantly. The assimilation of FAAs was changed dramatically by high ethanol toxicity, and positive correlations between the assimilation amounts of 10 FAAs (Asp, Ser, Gly, Arg, Tyr, Val, Met, Lys, Ile, and Leu) and fermentation performance (cell viability, fermentability, and ethanol production) were identified, especially for Arg and Lys exhibiting extremely significant positive correlations. Furthermore, confirmatory testing was carried out by supplementing 24°P worts with 10 FAAs of 0.5, 1, and 2 times of their standard concentrations, respectively. Results exhibited that 10 FAA supplementations improved physiological characteristics and fermentation performance of lager yeast significantly, especially for 1 times FAA supplementation increasing wort fermentability and ethanol yield by 6 and 17%, respectively, and upregulated the expression level of HSP12 and increased more intracellular trehalose accumulation in yeast cells, indicating that stronger protective function was stimulated in yeast cells. Therefore, it was suggested that these 10 FAAs could regulate yeast cells to adapt to high gravity environmental stresses.  aPublisher supplied data  aNo. 31501467cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aNo. 2452016086cFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities  aNo. 2017NY-157cShaanxi Province Key Research and Development Plan 3aamino acids 3abrewers yeast 3acell viability 3aethanol 3aethanol production 3afermentation 3afree amino acids 3agravity 3astress tolerance 3atoxicity 3atrehalose 3awort (brewing)1 aFeng, Li1 aPeng, Fei1 aXu, Huaide0 tApplied biochemistry and biotechnology.g2019 Feb., v. 187, no. 2 p.540-555dSpringer USwJournal:jnl32867x0273-22897nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12010-018-2840-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02188naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001600149245012000165300001400285520121500299592002801514650000801542650002001550650001501570650002701585653001301612653000901625653001101634653001301645653002901658700001701687773008701704856005001791852000901841655001201850IND60793967020221120064152.0220921e202211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079396702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ymeth.2022.09.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Yajing12aA pseudo-Siamese framework for circRNA-RBP binding sites prediction integrating BiLSTM and soft attention mechanism  ap. 57-64.  aCircular RNAs (circRNAs) are widely expressed in tissues and play a key role in diseases through interacting with RNA binding proteins (RBPs). Since the high cost of traditional technology, computational methods are developed to identify the binding sites between circRNAs and RBPs. Unfortunately, these methods suffer from the insufficient learning of features and the single classification of output. To address these limitations, we propose a novel method named circ-pSBLA which constructs a pseudo-Siamese framework integrating Bi-directional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) network and soft attention mechanism for circRNA-RBP binding sites prediction. Softmax function and CatBoost are adopted to classify, respectively, and then a pseudo-Siamese framework is constructed. circ-pSBLA combines them to get final output. To validate the effectiveness of circ-pSBLA, we compare it with other state-of-the-art methods and carry out an ablation experiment on 17 sub-datasets. Moreover, we do motif analysis on 3 sub-datasets. The results show that circ-pSBLA achieves superior performance and outperforms other methods.

Here, we describe a new species, Sarcocystis tuagulusi, infecting five of 12 Williamson’s mouse deer from southwest China. Mature sarcocysts are microscopic, up to 2280-μm long. The sarcocyst wall had 8.2-μm long villar protrusions, type 24. Using transmission electron microscopy, the protrusions on sarcocysts appeared as elongated, lancet- or leaf-like shapes in longitudinal sections; in contrast, the cross-sections revealed mushroom-shaped protrusions. In the core of the protrusion, a bundle of microtubules penetrated diagonally into a ground substance along the longitudinal axis. A phyogenetic analysis based on 18S rRNA and cox1 sequences suggested S. tuagulusi is closely related to Sarcocystis species from ruminants that employ felids as definitive hosts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFelidae 3aPeromyscus maniculatus 3aSarcocystis 3ahosts 3amicrotubules 3anew species 3aribosomal RNA 3aruminants 3asarcocysts 3atransmission electron microscopy 3aChina1 aHuang, Si1 aChen, Ming Yong1 aWen, Tao1 aEsch, Gerald Wisler1 aLiu, Qiong1 aLiu, Ting Ting0 tParasitology research.g2016 Mar., v. 115, no. 3 p.1325-1330dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0932-01137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-015-4869-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04299naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024004100132040001800173100001900191245008200210300001400292506002800306506003600334506007600370506003100446520208400477592002802561596009802589596004502687506003702732650002002769650001502789650001102804650001502815650002302830650001902853650002302872650002602895650002102921650001102942650002002953650001102973650001302984650001702997650001503014650002303029650002303052650001903075650002003094650001703114650001203131651002303143653002803166653002503194653003603219653002003255653002003275700002403295700002303319700001503342773013803357856008503495903002403580852000903604655001203613IND60549584320221207111256.0190318e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054958432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compag.2016.08.0132doi7 a10.1016/j.compag.2016.08.0132chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOsroosh, Yasin10aComparison of irrigation automation algorithms for drip-irrigated apple trees  ap. 87-99.  aResource is Open Access  aElsevier BV License Information  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aSeven irrigation scheduling algorithms and an automatic control system along with a wireless network of soil, thermal and weather sensors were developed and assessed in Prosser, WA in the growing season of 2013. The system was comprised of six wireless sensor and valve actuating nodes installed across an apple orchard, a central base station made up of a transceiver connected to a laptop, and a graphical user interface (GUI). The irrigation algorithms/treatments included the time-temperature threshold (TTT), crop water stress index with dynamic threshold (CWSI), soil-based using granular matrix sensors (SOIL), weather-based using a temperature-only-based evapotranspiration (ET) model and soil water balance (WB), a combination of SOIL and WB (SL+WB), a conventional irrigation practice used in the region (CNTRL), and soil-based using a neutron probe (NP) as benchmark. Different treatments were compared based on the total irrigation water (It) applied during the season. They were also compared based on simplicity and expense for a grower to implement. Soil water content (θs) and stem water potential (ψstem) were monitored in a number of treatment plots. The total applied water for CNTRL was significantly higher than all other treatments (p<0.001). The thermal-based TTT and CWSI treatments applied the same amount of water as NP and WB (p<0.001). CWSI and TTT substantially reduced water applied (70%) while maintaining ψstem within the non-stressed range. In addition, θs in the treatment plots of TTT and CWSI did not exceed the maximum allowed deficit recommended for apple trees (MAD of 50%) showing a strong agreement with NP. The SOIL and SL+WB treatments resulted in tangible under-irrigation as leaf drop, decreased leaf turgidity, growth reduction and abnormally small fruits were seen. Among all the strategies, WB seemed to bear the characteristics of being economical, easy to implement and fairly accurate. Our preliminary results also support the use of wireless sensor network for automatic irrigation management of drip-irrigated apple trees.  aPublisher supplied data  cAgWeatherNet (AWN) program at Washington State Universitydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100007588  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000001990 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aMalus domestica 3aalgorithms 3aapples 3aautomation 3aevapotranspiration 3agrowing season 3agrowth retardation 3airrigation scheduling 3airrigation water 3aleaves 3amicroirrigation 3amodels 3aorchards 3asmall fruits 3asoil water 3asoil water balance 3asoil water content 3auser interface 3awater potential 3awater stress 3aweather 3aWashington (state) 0aWireless sensor network 0aPlant-based approach 0aAutomatic irrigation scheduling 0aThermal sensing 0aDrip irrigation1 aPeters, Robert Troy1 aCampbell, Colin S.1 aZhang, Qin0 tComputers and electronics in agriculture.g2016 Oct., v. 128 p.87-99dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl38096x0168-16997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compag.2016.08.0133Available from publisher's site  aAccepted Manuscript  aDNAL 7aarticle03744naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100006000144245015000204300002000354500001900374520196000393592002802353650002702381650002602408650001302434650001502447650001202462650001602474650001602490650001302506650001702519650002802536650001902564650001302583650001502596650001602611650001102627650001802638653002502656653001602681653002002697653001802717653002302735700002402758700002302782700001702805700002102822700005902843700005902902773014202961856007803103852000903181655001203190IND60735373220221119205341.0210423e20210406xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073537322DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.1c010162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPorrelli, Davide1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6437-764610aAntibacterial Electrospun Polycaprolactone Membranes Coated with Polysaccharides and Silver Nanoparticles for Guided Bone and Tissue Regeneration  ap. 17255-17267.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aElectrospun polycaprolactone (PCL) membranes have been widely explored in the literature as a solution for several applications in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. PCL hydrophobicity and its lack of bioactivity drastically limit its use in the medical field. To overcome these drawbacks, many promising strategies have been developed and proposed in the literature. In order to increase the bioactivity of electrospun PCL membranes designed for guided bone and tissue regeneration purposes, in the present work, the membranes were functionalized with a coating of bioactive lactose-modified chitosan (CTL). Since CTL can be used for the synthesis and stabilization of silver nanoparticles, a coating of this compound was employed here to provide antibacterial properties to the membranes. Scanning electron microscopy imaging revealed that the electrospinning process adopted here allowed us to obtain membranes with homogeneous fibers and without defects. Also, PCL membranes retained their mechanical properties after several weeks of aging in simulated body fluid, representing a valid support for cell growth and tissue development. CTL adsorption on membranes was investigated by fluorescence microscopy using fluorescein-labeled CTL, resulting in a homogeneous and slow release over time. Inductively coupled plasma–mass spectrometry was used to analyze the release of silver, which was shown to be stably bonded to the CTL coating and to be slowly released over time. The CTL coating improved MG63 osteoblast adhesion and proliferation on membranes. On the other hand, the presence of silver nanoparticles discouraged biofilm formation by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus without being cytotoxic. Overall, the stability and the biological and antibacterial properties make these membranes a valid and versatile material for applications in guided tissue regeneration and in other biomedical fields like wound healing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aadhesion 3aadsorption 3abiofilm 3abody fluids 3acell growth 3achitosan 3acytotoxicity 3afluorescence microscopy 3ahydrophobicity 3amedicine 3ananosilver 3aosteoblasts 3asilver 3atissue repair 0asilver nanoparticles 0abioactivity 0aelectrospinning 0aantibacterial 0atissue engineering1 aMardirossian, Mario1 aMusciacchio, Luigi1 aPacor, Micol1 aBerton, Federico1 aCrosera, Matteo1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5950-093X1 aTurco, Gianluca1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5699-21310 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2021 Apr. 06, v. 13, no. 15 p.17255-17267dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.1c010163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01367naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245011300171300001400284520044400298592002800742653003300770653002800803653002600831700002500857700002200882773009000904856008600994852000901080655001201089IND60596150420221121005934.0180615e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059615042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.wavemoti.2018.01.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRivas, Cinthya12aA perfectly matched layer for finite-element calculations of diffraction by metallic surface-relief gratings  ap. 68-82.  aWe introduce a perfectly matched layer approach for finite element calculations of diffraction by metallic surface-relief gratings.

Greater fluxes were observed at higher soil temperatures and a higher water filled pore space, suggesting that denitrification was the main source of N₂O-N from the applied fertilizer/slurry. For WOSR, the N₂O EFs ranged from 0.03 to 1.20% with no effect of the cultivation practice on EFs for equal rates of nitrogen fertilizer. Lower EF values were linked to differences in plant growth at individual sites rather than a specific management effect. For the grassland, the N₂O EFs were highly variable, ranging from −0.70 to 0.49%, but were generally the highest in treatments receiving the highest concentrations of slurry. The EF values for WOSR illustrates that the Tier 1 approach for calculating EFs may be inadequate and the identification of site-specific effects can aid in refining N₂O EF inventories. For the grassland plots all the EFs were significantly lower than the IPCC default values. Although the reason(s) for the low EFs with slurry amendments on grassland is not known, ammonia volatilization could decrease the pool of inorganic N that is available to nitrifying bacteria thereby lowering N₂O fluxes.  aThis work was supported by the Department of Food and Agriculture [DAFM 10/RD/AGRI-I/716] and through a Teagasc Walsh Fellowship awarded to MON (RMIS 6363).  aPublisher supplied data  aXXXX  aWalsh Fellowship (RMIS 6363) 3aBrassica napus 3aammonia 3acattle 3aconventional tillage 3adenitrification 3agrasslands 3anitrogen 3anitrous oxide 3anitrous oxide production 3apig manure 3aplant growth 3aslurries 3astrip tillage 3avolatilization 0aN2O 0aemission factor 0atillage 0aslurry 0aarable 0agrassland1 aGallego-Lorenzo, L.1 aLanigan, G.

The objectives of these studies were to numerically characterize the prepuberal populations of bovine Sertoli cells to determine the pattern of proliferation and to determine if the prepuberal population could be expanded by reducing endogenous testicular estrogens. Groups of Angus-Hereford crossbred bull calves were castrated at 0.25 mo (n = 6) and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 mo of age (n = 8 per age). Testes were weighed and equatorial slices fixed. Sertoli cell density was determined following labeling of Sertoli cells with GATA-4 antibody in 30-μm thick sections. The number of Sertoli cells per testis increased linearly from 0.25 mo to 5 mo of age. Sertoli cell numbers appeared to plateau at 5 mo of age with luminal development present at that age. Only a single postnatal wave of Sertoli cell proliferation was detectable in the bull. To evaluate the regulatory role of testicular estrogens, Jersey bull caves were treated twice weekly with the aromatase inhibitor, letrozole, from 2 to 22 wk of age and control animals were treated with the canola oil vehicle. Testes were retrieved at 26 wk of age. Testes were weighed and Sertoli cell density was subsequently determined. Estradiol was lower in testicular tissue from letrozole-treated bulls as expected (P < 0.001). Inhibition of aromatase had no effect on testosterone or circulating LH; testosterone increased with age as expected. Inhibition of aromatase and consequent reduced testicular estradiol did not alter Sertoli cell numbers.  aPublisher supplied data  cAJCC Research Foundationdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100003583  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000001990 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aGATA transcription factors 3aJersey 3aSertoli cells 3aantibodies 3aaromatase 3abulls 3acalves 3acanola oil 3acastration 3acaves 3acell proliferation 3acrossbreds 3aenzyme inhibition 3aenzyme inhibitors 3aestradiol 3aluteinizing hormone 3aspermatogenesis 3aspermatozoa 3atestosterone 0aTestis 0aBovine 0aSertoli cell0 tTheriogenology.g2019 Sept. 15, v. 136 p.60-65dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl5209x0093-691X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2019.06.0313Available from publisher's site  aAccepted Manuscript  aDNAL 7aarticle03910naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003000147245017200177300001800349520173800367592002802105650001802133650002302151650002202174650001502196650004402211650002202255650001902277650001102296650003702307650001702344650001702361650001102378650002802389650001502417650002002432650001402452650001302466650001402479650001402493650001402507650001002521650003302531650001002564650001602574700002402590700003002614700002402644700003202668700002202700700002902722700002402751700002002775700002502795700002802820700002202848700001602870700002702886700002802913700002402941700001302965700002202978773011003000856008103110852000903191655001203200IND60488050020221122002139.0160219e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048805002DNAL7 a10.1007/s00436-015-4829-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChandramohan, Balamurugan10aCharacterization and mosquitocidal potential of neem cake-synthesized silver nanoparticles: genotoxicity and impact on predation efficiency of mosquito natural enemies  ap. 1015-1025.  aMosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) serve as important vectors for a wide number of parasites and pathogens of huge medical and veterinary importance. Aedes aegypti is a primary dengue vector in tropical and subtropical urban areas. There is an urgent need to develop eco-friendly mosquitocides. In this study, silver nanoparticles (AgNP) were biosynthesized using neem cake, a by-product of the neem oil extraction from the seed kernels of Azadirachta indica. AgNP were characterized using a variety of biophysical methods, including UV–vis spectrophotometry, FTIR, SEM, EDX, and XRD analyses. Furthermore, the neem cake extract and the biosynthesized AgNP were tested for acute toxicity against larvae and pupae of the dengue vector Ae. aegypti. LC₅₀ values achieved by the neem cake extract ranged from 106.53 (larva I) to 235.36 ppm (pupa), while AgNP LC₅₀ ranged from 3.969 (larva I) to 8.308 ppm (pupa). In standard laboratory conditions, the predation efficiency of a Carassius auratus per day was 7.9 (larva II) and 5.5 individuals (larva III). Post-treatment with sub-lethal doses of AgNP, the predation efficiency was boosted to 9.2 (larva II) and 8.1 individuals (larva III). The genotoxic effect of AgNP was studied on C. auratus using the comet assay and micronucleus frequency test. DNA damage was evaluated on peripheral erythrocytes sampled at different time intervals from the treatment; experiments showed no significant damages at doses below 12 ppm. Overall, this research pointed out that neem cake-fabricated AgNP are easy to produce, stable over time, and can be employed at low dosages to reduce populations of dengue vectors, with moderate detrimental effects on non-target mosquito natural enemies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAedes aegypti 3aAzadirachta indica 3aCarassius auratus 3aDNA damage 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aacute toxicity 3adengue 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3aerythrocytes 3agenotoxicity 3alarvae 3alethal concentration 50 3ananosilver 3anatural enemies 3aneem cake 3aneem oil 3aparasites 3apathogens 3apredation 3apupae 3ascanning electron microscopy 3aseeds 3aurban areas1 aMurugan, Kadarkarai1 aPanneerselvam, Chellasamy1 aMadhiyazhagan, Pari1 aChandirasekar, Ramachandran1 aDinesh, Devakumar1 aKumar, Palanisamy Mahesh1 aKovendan, Kalimuthu1 aSuresh, Udaiyan1 aSubramaniam, Jayapal1 aRajaganesh, Rajapandian1 aAziz, Al Thabiani1 aSyuhei, Ban1 aAlsalhi, Mohamad Saleh1 aDevanesan, Sandhanasamy1 aNicoletti, Marcello1 aWei, Hui1 aBenelli, Giovanni0 tParasitology research.g2016 Mar., v. 115, no. 3 p.1015-1025dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0932-01137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-015-4829-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02316naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094040001800117100002000135245009400155300001500249500001900264520108700283592002801370650001801398650002501416650001401441650001501455650001501470650001001485650001401495650001701509700001601526700001901542700002001561700001901581773015201600856006901752856010001821852000901921655001201930IND60741443320221119004926.0210615e20201204xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074144332DNAL7 a10.3791/619472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPark, Jeong-Eun10aIn vitro time-lapse live-cell imaging to explore cell migration toward the organ of corti  ap. e61947.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aTo study the effects of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) on cell regeneration and treatment, this method tracks MSC migration and morphological changes after co-culture with cochlear epithelium. The organ of Corti was immobilized on a plastic coverslip by pressing a portion of the Reissner's membrane generated during the dissection. MSCs confined by a glass cylinder migrated toward cochlear epithelium when the cylinder was removed. Their predominant localization was observed in the modiolus of the organ of Corti, aligned in a direction similarly to that of the nerve fibers. However, some MSCs were localized in the limbus area and showed a horizontally elongated shape. In addition, migration into the hair cell area was increased, and the morphology of the MSCs changed to various forms after kanamycin treatment. In conclusion, the results of this study indicate that the coculture of MSCs with cochlear epithelium will be useful for the development of therapeutics via cell transplantation and for studies of cell regeneration that can examine various conditions and factors.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell movement 3acell transplantation 3acoculture 3adissection 3aepithelium 3aglass 3akanamycin 3anerve tissue1 aYi, Su-hun,1 aPark, Dong Jun1 aSeo, Young Joon1 aKim, Sung Kyun0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2020 Dec. 04, , no. 166 p.e61947-e61947dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/619473Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/61947/in-vitro-time-lapse-live-cell-imaging-to-explore-cell-migration  aDNAL 7aarticle03115naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245013600172300001600308520202500324592002802349650001802377650001202395650001502407650001602422650001702438650002602455650002202481650001802503650001602521650001302537650001002550650001302560700002102573773009002594856004802684852000902732655001202741IND50070600420221120163827.0131113e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007060042DNAL7 a10.1007/s10452-013-9460-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOrlofske, Jessica M.14aThe tiny mayfly in the room: implications of size-dependent invertebrate taxonomic identification for biomonitoring data properties  ap. 481-494.  aThe appropriate level of taxonomic identification, taxonomic sufficiency, for biomonitoring purposes continues to be controversial. Taxonomic sufficiency, however, fails to address the bias created by size-dependent taxonomic identification, which can result in coarse-resolution identification for immature specimens lacking distinguishing characteristics. Our study provides a direct test for this potential systematic bias in biomonitoring data by examining two morphological traits: body size and shape of key organisms (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera and Odonata) collected from standard aquatic biomonitoring samples. Direct measurement of body size and a geometric morphometric description of body shape provide consistent, quantitative variables to describe the composition of specimens identified at different levels of taxonomic resolution (genus or family). Corroborating our expectations, we observed evidence of systematic size bias in family-level identifications. Specimens that could only reliably be identified to the family level were significantly smaller than specimens identified to the genus level. Qualitative comparisons of shape variation between specimens demonstrated a high degree of variation in specimens identified only at the family level and support the conclusion that specimens identified at the family level possess multiple constituent taxa (genera or species). Thus, size-dependent taxonomy can have negative consequences for the accurate determination of biodiversity and may invalidate common biomonitoring metrics. Improvements to biomonitoring protocols through technological advances, including DNA-based taxonomy to augment specimen identification, should effectively remove the size-bias problem in the long term. In the short-term, recognizing instances of size bias, the degree to which it may impact bioassessment and exploring methods for remediation, including traits-based assessments, can enhance data quality and inferences derived from biomonitoring studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEphemeroptera 3aOdonata 3aPlecoptera 3aTrichoptera 3abiodiversity 3abiological assessment 3abody measurements 3ainvertebrates 3aremediation 3asampling 3ashape 3ataxonomy1 aBaird, Donald J.0 tAquatic ecology.g2013 Dec., v. 47, no. 4 p.481-494dSpringer-Verlagx1386-25887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10452-013-9460-1  aDNAL 7aarticle02529naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245009900165300001800264520129600282592002801578650002001606650002901626650001101655650001901666650001501685650002801700650004101728650001801769650002101787700002301808700001801831700001701849700002001866700002001886700001901906773011601925856008102041852000902122655001202131IND60120868320221123032923.0150212e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012086832DNAL7 a10.1007/s00216-013-6903-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHui, Shu-Ping10aAnalysis of triacylglycerol hydroperoxides in human lipoproteins by Orbitrap mass spectrometer  ap. 4981-4987.  aHerein, we represent a simple method for the detection and characterization of molecular species of triacylglycerol monohydroperoxides (TGOOH) in biological samples by use of reversed-phase liquid chromatography with a LTQ Orbitrap XL mass spectrometer (LC/LTQ Orbitrap) via an electrospray ionization source. Data were acquired using high-resolution, high-mass accuracy in Fourier-transform mode. Platform performance, related to the identification of TGOOH in human lipoproteins and plasma, was estimated using extracted ion chromatograms with mass tolerance windows of 5 ppm. Native low-density lipoproteins (nLDL) and native high-density lipoproteins (nHDL) from a healthy donor were oxidized by CuSO₄to generate oxidized LDL (oxLDL) and oxidized HDL (oxHDL). No TGOOH molecular species were detected in the nLDL and nHDL, whereas 11 species of TGOOH molecules were detected in the oxLDL and oxHDL. In positive-ion mode, TGOOH was found as [M + NH₄]⁺. In negative-ion mode, TGOOH was observed as [M + CH₃COO]–. TGOOH was more easily ionized in positive-ion mode than in negative-ion mode. The LC/LTQ Orbitrap method was applied to human plasma and three molecular species of TGOOH were detected. The limit of detection is 0.1 pmol (S/N = 10:1) for each synthesized TGOOH.  aPublisher supplied data 3adetection limit 3ahigh density lipoprotein 3ahumans 3ahydroperoxides 3aionization 3alow density lipoprotein 3areversed-phase liquid chromatography 3aspectrometers 3atriacylglycerols1 aSakurai, Toshihiro1 aTakeda, Seiji1 aJin, Shigeki1 aFuda, Hirotoshi1 aKurosawa, Takao1 aChiba, Hitoshi0 tAnalytical and bioanalytical chemistry.g2013 May, v. 405, no. 14 p.4981-4987dSpringer-Verlagx1618-26427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00216-013-6903-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02268naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245011000172300001800282520106900300592002801369650002101397650002101418650002401439650001801463650001001481650002201491650001801513650002401531650002301555653001801578653001801596653002801614700001601642700001901658773011001677856008601787852000901873655001201882IND60586975620221119204502.0200711e20180201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058697562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2017.11.0492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSolanki, Archana12aA review on carbohydrate embedded polyurethanes: An emerging area in the scope of biomedical applications  ap. 1003-1016.  aPolyurethanes (PUs) are expanding to newer horizons in the field of biomedical sciences, particularly due to their exceptional set of properties that deem fit for applications in the said field. On the other hand, carbohydrates find increasing attention as components of biomedical devices due to their easy availability from renewable resources. The manipulation of PUs by carbohydrate has solved the major concern of biodegradability, biocompatibility and economy. This review summarizes the recent trends in PUs embedded with carbohydrates ranging from monosaccharide to polysaccharides, including supramolecular host such as cyclodextrin etc. Diverse approaches for embedding them in PUs in various forms have been listed. In recent decade, significant research has been carried out to employ such polymers in biomedical applications such as drug delivery devices, implants, scaffolds for tissue engineering etc. This knowledge could facilitate the selection of more efficient approach for synthesis of polymeric systems based on the biological macromolecules.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiocompatibility 3abiodegradability 3abiomedical research 3acyclodextrins 3adrugs 3amedical equipment 3apolyurethanes 3arenewable resources 3atissue engineering 0aCarbohydrates 0aPolyurethanes 0aBiomedical applications1 aDas, Manita1 aThakore, Sonal0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2018 Feb. 01, v. 181 p.1003-1016dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2017.11.0493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03292naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245014800164300001600312520170000328592002802028650001702056650003002073650002202103650002302125650001802148650002202166650001202188650001102200650001302211650001902224651001002243651002102253653001602274653002402290653002902314653003902343653002102382653001002403700002202413700001402435700001702449700001402466700002002480700001702500700005602517773010702573856008502680852000902765655001202774IND60605649720221121004208.0190215e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060564972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocon.2015.12.0442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Lin10aConservation priorities of forest ecosystems with evaluations of connectivity and future threats: Implications in the Eastern Himalaya of China  ap. 128-135.  aInternational biodiversity conservation prioritization efforts often focus on biodiversity hotspots or valuable species. However, for most parts of the world, comprehensive species data with acceptable quality are still scarce to support regional priority evaluations. To model the factors that favor a high/important degree of biodiversity and threats; in this study, we provide an alternative conservation priority approach to use when species data are insufficient. Based on a Landsat-derived forest cover map of 2010 of the Eastern Himalaya of China, we defined forest nodes, measured and delineated their importance with the connectivity metric dPC at regional and sub-regional scales. Based on a deforestation map of 2000 to 2010, we simulated deforestation from 2010 to 2030 using the Dinamica EGO software at multiple scales, and calculated the threatened degree of each forest node at an optimal scale. We then ranked the conservation priorities by coupling the measurements of the connectivity importance values and simulated threatened degree of each important forest node. Six forest patches (2.5% of remaining forest in 2010) were ranked as conservation priority patch-I and II. The unprotected parts are recommended to be expanded into or established as new nature reserves. Although species information was not used, the identified forest patches accommodated existing nature reserves (48% overlapped) in this region. As a fast and efficient assessment approach, with outcomes that are valuable for regional conservation planning, this method could be widely used for any forest dominant regions when field data is insufficient to identify conservation priorities at a fine scale.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3abiodiversity conservation 3acomputer software 3aconservation areas 3adeforestation 3aforest ecosystems 3aforests 3amodels 3aplanning 3aprioritization 3aChina 3aHimalayan region 0aForest node 0aForest connectivity 0aDeforestation simulation 0aBiodiversity conservation priority 0aEastern Himalaya 0aChina1 aYoung, Stephen S.1 aWang, Wei1 aRen, Guopeng1 aXiao, Wen1 aLong, Yongcheng1 aLi, Junsheng1 aZhu, Jianguo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4462-89350 tBiological conservation.g2016 Mar., v. 195 p.128-135dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl44607x0006-32077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2015.12.0443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04562naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001700094024002100111024003900132024001100171040001800182100002000200245017900220300001800399506017300417520209600590592002802686650002202714650001602736650001502752650001302767650001902780650002002799650001302819650001102832650002002843650001902863650002102882650001702903650001802920650001202938650001802950650002002968650002202988650001303010650001903023650001203042653001303054653004403067653001803111653002603129700002003155700001403175700005803189700002103247700002203268700001803290700002203308700002003330700002703350700002103377773009903398856008603497856011203583956013503695961001303830852000903843655001203852IND60006134520221214225301.0190319e20150709xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6000613452DNAL7 a3127242aris7 a10113/613452hdl7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2015.05.0762doi8 ans8030  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBertran, Kateri10aExpression of H5 hemagglutinin vaccine antigen in common duckweed (Lemna minor) protects against H5N1 high pathogenicity avian influenza virus challenge in immunized chickens  ap. 3456-3462.  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aA synthetic hemagglutinin (HA) gene from the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus A/chicken/Indonesia/7/2003 (H5N1) (Indo/03) was expressed in aquatic plant Lemna minor (rLemna-HA). In Experiment 1, efficacy of rLemna-HA was tested on birds immunized with 0.2μg or 2.3μg HA and challenged with 106 mean chicken embryo infectious doses (EID50) of homologous virus strain. Both dosages of rLemna-HA conferred clinical protection and dramatically reduced viral shedding. Almost all the birds immunized with either dosage of rLemna-HA elicited HA antibody titers against Indo/03 antigen, suggesting an association between levels of anti-Indo/03 antibodies and protection. In Experiment 2, efficacy of rLemna-HA was tested on birds immunized with 0.9μg or 2.2μg HA and challenged with 106 EID50 of heterologous H5N1 virus strains A/chicken/Vietnam/NCVD-421/2010 (VN/10) or A/chicken/West Java/PWT-WIJ/2006 (PWT/06). Birds challenged with VN/10 exhibited 100% survival regardless of immunization dosage, while birds challenged with PWT/06 had 50% and 30% mortality at 0.9μg HA and 2.2μg HA, respectively. For each challenge virus, viral shedding titers from 2.2μg HA vaccinated birds were significantly lower than those from 0.9μg HA vaccinated birds, and titers from both immunized groups were in turn significantly lower than those from sham vaccinated birds. Even if immunized birds elicited HA titers against the vaccine antigen Indo/03, only the groups challenged with VN/10 developed humoral immunity against the challenge antigen. None (rLemna-HA 0.9μg HA) and 40% (rLemna-HA 2.2μg HA) of the immunized birds challenged with PWT/06 elicited pre-challenge antibody titers, respectively. In conclusion, Lemna-expressed HA demonstrated complete protective immunity against homologous challenge and suboptimal protection against heterologous challenge, the latter being similar to results from inactivated whole virus vaccines. Transgenic duckweed-derived HA could be a good alternative for producing high quality antigen for an injectable vaccine against H5N1 HPAI viruses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInfluenza A virus 3aLemna minor 3aantibodies 3aantigens 3aaquatic plants 3aavian influenza 3achickens 3adosage 3agene expression 3ahemagglutinins 3ahumoral immunity 3aimmunization 3apathogenicity 3astrains 3asurvival rate 3asynthetic genes 3atransgenic plants 3avaccines 3aviral shedding 3aviruses 0aChickens 0aH5N1 high pathogenicity avian influenza 0aHemagglutinin 0aPlant-derived vaccine1 aThomas, Colleen1 aGuo, Xuan1 aBublot, Michel1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6627-865X1 aPritchard, Nikki1 aRegan, Jeffrey T.1 aCox, Kevin M.1 aGasdaska, John R.1 aDickey, Lynn F.1 aKapczynski, Darrell R.1 aSwayne, David E.0 tVaccine.g2015 July 09, v. 33, no. 30 p.3456-3462dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2015.05.0763Available from publisher's site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/613453Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  aARIS submissionbhttp://submit-u.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/Expression%20of%20H5%20hemagglutinin%20vaccine...312724.pdf  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle03127naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245012400162300001800286520186400304592002802168650002402196650002002220650001802240650002102258650002602279650001302305650001502318650002702333650002902360650000902389650001002398700002302408700002202431700001902453700002202472700001702494773011602511856008102627852000902708655001202717IND60120868420221123045054.0150212e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012086842DNAL7 a10.1007/s00216-013-6907-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuan, Fuyu10aDetection, quantification, and identification of dermorphin in equine plasma and urine by LC–MS/MS for doping control  ap. 4707-4717.  aDermorphin is a unique opioid peptide that is 30–40 times more potent than morphine. It was misused and went undetected in horse racing until 2011 when intelligence obtained from a few North American race tracks suggested its use. To prevent such misuse, a reliable analytical method became necessary for detection and identification of dermorphin in post-race horse samples. This paper describes the first liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) method for such a purpose. Equine plasma and urine samples were pre-treated with ethylenediamine tetra-acetic acid and urea prior to solid-phase extraction (SPE) on Oasis MCX cartridges. Resulting eluates were dried under vacuum and analyzed by LC–MS/MS for dermorphin. The matrix effect, SPE efficiency, intra-day and inter-day accuracy and precision, and stability of the analyte were assessed. The limit of detection was 10 pg/mL in plasma and 20 pg/mL in urine, and the limit of confirmation was 20 pg/mL in plasma and 50 pg/mL in urine. Dermorphin in plasma is stable at ambient temperature, but its diastereomer is unstable. With isotopically labeled dermorphin as an internal standard, the quantification range was 20–10,000 pg/mL in plasma and 50–20,000 pg/mL in urine. The intra-day and inter-day accuracy was from 91 % to 100 % for the low, intermediate, and high concentrations. The intra-day and inter-day coefficients of variation were less than 12 %. The method differentiates dermorphin from its diastereomer. This method is very specific for identification of dermorphin in equine plasma and urine, as assessed by BLAST search and targeted SEQUEST search, and by MS/MS spectrum library search. The method has been successfully applied to analysis of samples collected following dermorphin administration to research horses and of official post-race samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3adetection limit 3adiastereomers 3aisotope labeling 3aliquid chromatography 3amorphine 3aracehorses 3asolid phase extraction 3atandem mass spectrometry 3aurea 3aurine1 aUboh, Cornelius E.1 aSoma, Lawrence R.1 aRobinson, Mary1 aMaylin, George A.1 aLi, Xiaoqing0 tAnalytical and bioanalytical chemistry.g2013 May, v. 405, no. 14 p.4707-4717dSpringer-Verlagx1618-26427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00216-013-6907-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02627naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003000151245008600181300001700267520089500284592002801179650001301207650001001220650001501230650001501245650001801260650002201278650002401300650001501324650002301339650002301362650001301385650003301398650001101431653000701442653000701449653000801456653000801464653000801472653000801480653000801488653000801496653000801504653000801512653000801520653000801528653000801536653000801544653000801552653000801560653000801568653000801576653000701584653001701591653001501608653001901623653003001642653002101672700002301693700002101716773010901737856008601846852000901932655001201941IND60586975720221119204313.0200711e20180201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058697572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2017.11.0502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRovalino-Córdova, Ana M.12aA closer look to cell structural barriers affecting starch digestibility in beans  ap. 994-1002.  aIsolated bean cells were used to understand the contribution of cell wall and cytoplasmic matrix on starch digestibility. Cotyledon cells were treated enzymatically and mechanically to reduce the level of cell intactness. SEM and chemical characterization revealed that enzymatic treatment modified cell wall thickness and porosity without altering the cytoplasmic matrix, whereas mechanical treatment completely disrupted cell structure. Decreasing cell intactness increased the rate but not the extent of starch digestion in-vitro. It was concluded that cell wall serves as a permeable barrier limiting the access of digestive enzymes. Cytoplasmic matrix, on the other hand, reduced further the accessibility of amylase to starch affecting its hydrolysis rate. In addition, it was proven that cell structural changes, if any, occurring during digestion had no effect on starch hydrolysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamylases 3abeans 3acell walls 3acotyledons 3adigestibility 3adigestive enzymes 3aenzymatic treatment 3ahydrolysis 3ain vitro digestion 3amechanical methods 3aporosity 3ascanning electron microscopy 3astarch 0aDF 0aGI 0aICC 0aMDC 0aEDC 0aWSP 0aWIP 0aSEM 0aNSP 0aICW 0aEDW 0aRha 0aFuc 0aAra 0aXyl 0aMan 0aGal 0aGlc 0aUA 0aKidney beans 0aCell walls 0aMicrostructure 0aIn-vitro starch digestion 0aBioaccessibility1 aFogliano, Vincenzo1 aCapuano, Edoardo0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2018 Feb. 01, v. 181 p.994-1002dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2017.11.0503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03447naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094040001800117100002000135245008400155300001500239500001900254520190100273592002802174650001502202650002102217650001202238650001002250650002502260650001602285650002802301650001102329650001502340650000902355650001102364650002502375650002002400650001502420650001702435650002502452700002502477700002302502700002002525700001902545700002502564700001802589773015202607856006902759856010402828852000902932655001202941IND60741443420221119004927.0210615e20210423xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074144342DNAL7 a10.3791/620092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrown, Loren M.10aModeling breast cancer in human breast tissue using a microphysiological system  ap. e62009.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aBreast cancer (BC) remains a leading cause of death for women. Despite more than $700 million invested in BC research annually, 97% of candidate BC drugs fail clinical trials. Therefore, new models are needed to improve our understanding of the disease. The NIH Microphysiological Systems (MPS) program was developed to improve the clinical translation of basic science discoveries and promising new therapeutic strategies. Here we present a method for generating MPS for breast cancers (BC-MPS). This model adapts a previously described approach of culturing primary human white adipose tissue (WAT) by sandwiching WAT between adipose-derived stem cell sheets (ASC)s. Novel aspects of our BC-MPS include seeding BC cells into non-diseased human breast tissue (HBT) containing native extracellular matrix, mature adipocytes, resident fibroblasts, and immune cells; and sandwiching the BC-HBT admixture between HBT-derived ASC sheets. The resulting BC-MPS is stable in culture ex vivo for at least 14 days. This model system contains multiple elements of the microenvironment that influence BC including adipocytes, stromal cells, immune cells, and the extracellular matrix. Thus BC-MPS can be used to study the interactions between BC and its microenvironment. We demonstrate the advantages of our BC-MPS by studying two BC behaviors known to influence cancer progression and metastasis: 1) BC motility and 2) BC-HBT metabolic crosstalk. While BC motility has previously been demonstrated using intravital imaging, BC-MPS allows for high-resolution time-lapse imaging using fluorescence microscopy over several days. Furthermore, while metabolic crosstalk was previously demonstrated using BC cells and murine pre-adipocytes differentiated into immature adipocytes, our BC-MPS model is the first system to demonstrate this crosstalk between primary human mammary adipocytes and BC cells in vitro.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadipocytes 3abreast neoplasms 3abreasts 3adeath 3aextracellular matrix 3afibroblasts 3afluorescence microscopy 3ahumans 3ametastasis 3amice 3amodels 3aneoplasm progression 3aorgan-on-a-chip 3astem cells 3atherapeutics 3awhite adipose tissue1 aHebert, Katherine L.1 aGurrala, Rakesh R.1 aByrne, C.

An increasing number of isolates (i.e., 10 to 13%) recovered from clinical specimens from these cases were more unusual or rarely isolated genera and/or species (i.e., ≤5 individual cases/annum). VITEK® MS (MALDI-TOF MS) is done initially on all anaerobic bacteria, but rare isolates undergo in-house PCR/sequencing when proteomics provides a wrong ID or no results despite repeat testing. A clinical microbiologist in consultation with the Infectious Diseases service approves molecular analyses. This multi-year comparison (2014-19) of the performance of MALDI-TOF MS and 16S rRNA gene sequencing using the IDNS® SmartGene bacterial dataset shows both method's abilities to provide a genus-level and/or species-level ID for rare isolates. 489 rare anaerobes were recovered from a variety of clinical specimens: 57% blood cultures, 19% other sterile fluids, 14% sterile tissues, 8% deep wounds/abscesses, and 2% prosthetic implants. 16S rRNA gene sequencing gave an accurate genus-vs. species level ID for 487/489 (99.6%) and 401/489 (82.0%) of isolates respectively. Accurate genus-vs species-level ID were obtained by MALDI-TOF MS for 269/489 (53.4%) and 187/489 (37.3%) of isolates respectively. MALDI-TOF MS gave wrong or no results for 35.1% of Gram-negative anaerobic cocci (GNAC), 62% of Gram-negative anaerobic bacilli (GNAB), 30.8% of Gram-positive anaerobic cocci (GPAC) and 46.3% of Gram-positive anaerobic bacilli (GPAB). Neither method gave an ID for one GNAB and one GPAC isolate. MALDI-TOF MS genus-level ID of GNAC and genus/species-level ID of GPAB improved during the study but its performance remained stable for genus- or species-level ID of other organism groups. MALDI-TOF MS provides accurate ID for most common anaerobes, but molecular analyses need to be available for rare isolates. Large complex laboratories should have a workflow for sending rare isolates for 16S rRNA gene sequencing in invasive cases where a definitive ID is clinically required.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanaerobes 3ablood 3adata collection 3agenes 3ahumans 3aprostheses 3aproteomics 3aCanada 0aAnaerobes 0aVITEK® MS 0aMALDI-TOF MS 0a16S rRNA gene sequencing 0aIdentification1 aGriener, T.1 aGregson, D.0 tAnaerobe.g2022 Dec., v. 78 p.102640-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12008x1075-99647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anaerobe.2022.1026403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03080naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002100155245016600176300001400342520170800356592002802064650002002092650002402112650002802136650001502164650001602179650002002195650001702215650001402232650001202246650001202258650001402270650001102284650001202295650001202307650002202319650001402341700001702355700002102372700002602393700002202419773008302441856008902524852000902613655001202622IND50059993720221119114021.0141110e20121124xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5005999372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2012.09.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBowyer, Jenna N.14aThe response of digestive enzyme activities and gut histology in yellowtail kingfish (Seriola lalandi) to dietary fish oil substitution at different temperatures  ap. 19-28.  aYellowtail kingfish (Seriola lalandi) were fed five diets in which the dietary lipid component was replaced with 100% lipid as either poultry oil (PO), canola oil (CO), a blend of fish oil and poultry oil (FO/PO; 50:50) or a blend of fish oil and canola oil (FO/CO; 50:50) and held at 18 or 22°C. After five weeks, the changes in gastrointestinal histology and digestive enzyme activity of fish were examined. Digestive trypsin, lipase and α-amylase enzyme activities were downregulated in fish held at 18°C. The α-amylase activity was not influenced by diet, but the trypsin activities were significantly lower in fish fed the CO diet than fish fed the FO and FO/PO diets. Although the lipase activities were significantly lower in fish fed the CO diet than fish fed the FO/PO diet at 18°C and 22°C, there were no significant differences between fish fed other diets at both temperatures. The reduction in trypsin activity in fish fed the CO diet may be attributed to anti-nutritional factors present in the canola oil. The histology of the foregut and hindgut showed no signs of diet-induced enteritis. However, there was a high influx of goblet cells and severe reduction in supranuclear vacuolisation across all dietary treatments, including the fish oil control diet at both water temperatures and in initial fish samples. As no information exists on the histology of juvenile yellowtail kingfish this study provides baseline information for further study. However, reference tissue from wild fish is recommended to determine the validity of these findings and for the future histological assessment of this economically important fish species to dietary or environmental temperature changes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSeriola lalandi 3aambient temperature 3aantinutritional factors 3acanola oil 3adietary fat 3aenzyme activity 3afish feeding 3afish oils 3aforegut 3ahindgut 3ahistology 3alipids 3apoultry 3atrypsin 3awater temperature 3awild fish1 aQin, Jian G.1 aAdams, Louise R.1 aThomson, Michael J.S.1 aStone, David A.J.0 tAquaculture.g2012 Nov. 24, v. 368-369 p.19-28dElsevier B.V.x0044-84867nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2012.09.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02688naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245014200170300001300312520171700325592002802042653002602070653001902096653001802115653001902133700005702152773010902209856008302318852000902401655001202410IND60625298820221120125155.0190328e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062529882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.erss.2018.10.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarron, Robert W.12aA wedge or a weight? Critically examining nuclear power’s viability as a low carbon energy source from an intergenerational perspective  ap. 7-17.  aSome integrated assessment studies of climate change have concluded that nuclear energy has a large potential impact on carbon abatement costs. However, these studies have often modeled the cost of nuclear waste management very simply or neglected it entirely. Common difficulties with existing studies include the use of simplistic nuclear waste management cost models and implicitly minimizing costs in the distant future by using discount rates that are arguably inappropriate for intergenerational cost-benefit analysis. These difficulties lead to results that may underestimate the cost of nuclear waste management – and therefore overestimate the value of nuclear energy as a low carbon energy technology. Here, we consider how a more realistic treatment of the nuclear waste disposal problem than has been used in previous studies could affect the viability of nuclear power in the context of integrated assessments of climate change. We construct a generic nuclear waste management cost model to develop cost estimates for nuclear waste management based on current policy, practice, and cost estimates for storage and disposal technologies. Our cost estimates are discounted using conventional constant exponential discounting as and a declining discount rate scheme. Results suggest that the optimism reflected in previous works is fragile: More realistic nuclear waste management cost models and uncertainty-appropriate intergenerational discount rates produce many more scenarios in which nuclear waste management costs are higher than previously assumed. As a consequence, nuclear energy’s economic attractiveness as a low carbon energy option is appears to be lower than earlier works suggested.  aPublisher supplied data 0aIntegrated assessment 0aNuclear energy 0aNuclear waste 0aClimate change1 aHill, Mary C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0545-33780 tEnergy research & social science.g2019 Apr., v. 50 p.7-17dElsevier LtdwJournal:26851x2214-62967nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.erss.2018.10.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02335naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001500141245016200156520123000318592002801548650001401576650000901590650001701599650001301616650002401629650001601653650002301669650001301692650001701705650001701722700002001739700002101759773012001780856007601900852000901976655001201985IND60768230320221119152235.0220225e20220214xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076823032DNAL7 a10.3390/ani120404672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Boin 10aAssociations of Apoptotic and Anti-Apoptotic Factors with Beef Quality, Histochemical Characteristics, and Palatability of Hanwoo Longissimus thoracis Muscle  aThis study compared the meat quality, histochemical traits, palatability, and expression levels of apoptotic (cytochrome c and caspases) and anti-apoptotic (small heat shock proteins) factors at 45 min and 24 h post-mortem of Hanwoo Longissimus thoracis muscles in groups categorized by Warner-Bratzler shear force (WBS) values to investigate the association between beef tenderness variation and apoptosis-related molecules.

The first clade includes S. catharinae and S. perpusillus groups, whereas the second clade includes S. rostratus and S. uruguayus groups. Chromosome morphology, NOR and C-banding patterns of variation support these clades. This study aims the cytogenetic characterization of five species currently included in the S. perpusillus group: Scinax sp. (gr. perpusillus), S. arduous, S. belloni, S. cosenzai, and S. v-signatus, including standard cytogenetic techniques and repetitive DNA FISH probes. All species had 2n = 24 chromosomes. Nucleolar organizing regions occurred in chromosome pair 6 in all species, but differed in their locations among some species, suggesting a putative synaponomastic character for the clade. In S. belloni, the first chromosome pair was a metacentric, contrasting with the submetacentric first pair reported in all other species of the genus. Scinax sp. (gr. perpusillus) and S. v-signatus had similar karyotypic formulae, suggesting they are related species. Scinax cosenzai had a divergent C-banding pattern. Repetitive DNA probes hybridized more frequently in chromosomal subtelomeric regions in all species indicating recent cladogenesis in these species. Karyotypic evidence indicates unreported high levels of stabilization within S. perpusillus and in S. catharinae clade, resulting in a wealth of characters potentially informative for higher phylogenetic analyses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDNA probes 3aHylidae 3abioacoustics 3achromosome banding 3achromosome morphology 3achromosomes 3afluorescence in situ hybridization 3akaryotyping 3aphylogeny 3aBrazil1 aLacerda, João Victor Andrade1 aCoelho-Augusto, Carolina1 aFeio, Renato Neves1 aDergam, Jorge Abdala0 tGenetica.g2015 Dec., v. 143, no. 6 p.729-739dSpringer International Publishingx0016-67077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10709-015-9870-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03398naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100001500137245016400152300001800316520163200334650002201966650002201988650002802010650002002038650002602058650001602084650001402100650002602114650001602140650001402156650001702170650001502187650001402202650002802216650001002244650001502254650002302269650002102292650003202313650002202345650003702367650001402404650004402418650002002462650002602482650001002508700001702518700001502535700002202550700001902572700001802591773016202609856004002771852000902811655001202820IND4534976320221119085103.0150914s2014    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND453497632DNAL7 a10.1021/jf500054f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiao, Jian10aSecondary Metabolites from the Endophytic Botryosphaeria dothidea of Melia azedarach and Their Antifungal, Antibacterial, Antioxidant, and Cytotoxic Activities  ap. 3584-3590.  aTwo new metabolites, an Î±-pyridone derivative, 3-hydroxy-2-methoxy-5-methylpyridin-2(1H)-one (1), and a ceramide derivative, 3-hydroxy-N-(1-hydroxy-3-methylpentan-2-yl)-5-oxohexanamide (2), and a new natural product, 3-hydroxy-N-(1-hydroxy-4-methylpentan-2-yl)-5-oxohexanamide (3), along with 15 known compounds including chaetoglobosin C (7) and chaetoglobosin F (8) were isolated from the solid culture of the endophytic fungus Botryosphaeria dothidea KJ-1, collected from the stems of white cedar (Melia azedarach L). The structures were elucidated on the basis of spectroscopic analysis (1D and 2D NMR experiments and by mass spectrometric measurements), and the structure of 1 was confirmed by X-ray single-crystal diffraction. These metabolites were evaluated in vitro for antimicrobial, antioxidant, and cytotoxicity activities. Pycnophorin (4) significantly inhibited the growth of Bacillus subtilis and Staphyloccocus aureus with equal minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of 25 Î¼M. Stemphyperylenol (5) displayed a potent antifungal activity against the plant pathogen Alternaria solani with MIC of 1.57 Î¼M comparable to the commonly used fungicide carbendazim. Both altenusin (9) and djalonensone (10) showed markedly DPPH radical scavenging activities. In addition, stemphyperylenol (5) and altenuene (6) exhibited strong cytotoxicity against HCT116 cancer cell line with a median inhibitory concentration (IC50) value of 3.13 Î¼M in comparison with the positive control etoposide (IC50 = 2.13 Î¼M).

The primary site of s-metolachlor and dimethenamid-P absorption was through the sugarbeet roots; however, some absorption occurred through the sugarbeet hypocotyl. Sugarbeet injury was greater from dimethenamid-P than s-metolachlor when sugarbeet was grown in soil. However, when sugarbeet was grown hydroponically, injury from the herbicides was similar, indicating that the relative availability of these herbicides in the soil greatly influenced sugarbeet injury. Reduced translocation and slower metabolism of ¹⁴C-dimethenamid-P in both the roots and shoots of the sugarbeet plants most likely contributed to the greater susceptibility of sugarbeet to dimethenamid-P compared with s-metolachlor. Metabolism of ¹⁴C-herbicides in sugarbeet shoots was 0.7 to 2.1 h slower in the more susceptible sugarbeet varieties compared with the more tolerant variety, Beta 5833R. This was the most significant factor contributing to differences in sugarbeet variety tolerance to both s-metolachlor and dimethenamid-P.Nomenclature: s-Metolachlor; dimethenamid-P; sugarbeet, Beta vulgaris L.  aPublisher supplied data 3acultivars 3asugar beet 3ahypocotyls 3abioavailability 3ametabolic detoxification 3atranslocation (plant physiology) 3ahydroponics 3ametolachlor 3auptake mechanisms 3aherbicide resistance 3aplant damage 3aroots 3aBeta vulgaris 0aherbicide uptake 0aherbicide translocation 0aherbicides 0aMetabolism1 aSprague, Christy L.1 aPenner, Donald0 tWeed science.g2008 Jan., v. 56, no. 1 p.18-25dWeed Science Society of America]x0043-17457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1614%2FWS-07-100.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03317naa a2200721 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003600135040001800171100001200189245007500201300001600276506007600292520113400368592002801502506003701530650002201567650001201589650001001601650001701611650000901628650001801637650001201655650001301667650001701680650001601697650001401713650002001727650001601747650001201763650002201775650001701797650003001814650000901844650002101853650001301874650003701887650003801924650004301962650001702005650002402022650003902046650005102085650003902136650002402175650004202199700002502241700002002266700002002286700001802306700001702324700001602341700001102357700002302368700002102391773008002412856008202492852000902574655001202583IND60092517420221207112031.0141103e20110107xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009251742DNAL7 a212153732pmid7 aPMC30340902pmcid7 a10.1016/j.cell.2010.11.0532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBai, Ge10aPresenilin-Dependent Receptor Processing Is Required for Axon Guidance  ap. 106-118.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe Alzheimer's disease-linked gene presenilin is required for intramembrane proteolysis of amyloid-β precursor protein, contributing to the pathogenesis of neurodegeneration that is characterized by loss of neuronal connections, but the role of Presenilin in establishing neuronal connections is less clear. Through a forward genetic screen in mice for recessive genes affecting motor neurons, we identified the Columbus allele, which disrupts motor axon projections from the spinal cord. We mapped this mutation to the Presenilin-1 gene. Motor neurons and commissural interneurons in Columbus mutants lacking Presenilin-1 acquire an inappropriate attraction to Netrin produced by the floor plate because of an accumulation of DCC receptor fragments within the membrane that are insensitive to Slit/Robo silencing. Our findings reveal that Presenilin-dependent DCC receptor processing coordinates the interplay between Netrin/DCC and Slit/Robo signaling. Thus, Presenilin is a key neural circuit builder that gates the spatiotemporal pattern of guidance signaling, thereby ensuring neural projections occur with high fidelity.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAlzheimer disease 3aalleles 3aaxons 3ainterneurons 3amice 3amotor neurons 3amutants 3amutation 3apathogenesis 3aproteolysis 3areceptors 3arecessive genes 3aspinal cord 2aAnimals 2aAxonsxmetabolism 2aChick Embryo 2aGlycoproteinsxmetabolism 2aMice 2aMice, Transgenic 2aMutation 2aNerve Growth Factorsxmetabolism 2aNerve Tissue Proteinsxmetabolism 2aNeurodegenerative Diseasesxmetabolism 2aNeurogenesis 2aNeuronsxmetabolism 2aPresenilinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aReceptors, Cell Surfacexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aReceptors, Immunologicxmetabolism 2aSignal Transduction 2aTumor Suppressor Proteinsxmetabolism1 aChivatakarn, Onanong1 aBonanomi, Dario1 aLettieri, Karen1 aFranco, Laura1 aXia, Caihong1 aStein, Elke1 aMa, Le1 aLewcock, Joseph W.1 aPfaff, Samuel L.0 tCell.g2011 Jan. 7, v. 144, no. 1 p.106-118dElsevier Inc.x0092-86747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2010.11.0533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02557naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245011300165300001600278520125300294592002801547650001501575650002301590650001501613650002801628650001401656650001501670650001701685650002401702650001601726650002001742653000901762653002401771653001101795653001001806653001001816653001001826700001501836700001501851700001901866700001901885773010101904856008502005852000902090655001202099IND60775500920221119092112.0220606e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077550092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molimm.2022.04.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPan, Lehan10aTBK1 participates in glutaminolysis by mediating the phosphorylation of RIPK3 to promote endotoxin tolerance  ap. 101-114.  aTRAF-associated NF-κB activator (TANK)-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), a nonclassical IκB kinase (IKK), and its effect on inflammation have not been entirely clarified. Here, we identified that TBK1 participates in the catabolism of glutamine by mediating the phosphorylation of receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 (RIPK3) and promoting macrophage endotoxin tolerance (ET). We found that the TBK1 protein directly interacts with the RIPK3 protein and mediates the phosphorylation of RIPK3 in macrophages. Activated RIPK3 can directly bind to glutamate dehydrogenase 1 (GLUD1), which is known to be a critical enzyme for catalyzing glutamine decomposition, to improve its catalytic activity and increase the production of α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) in macrophages. α-KG generated from glutaminolysis can promote M2 activation and restrict M1 polarization, which plays a crucial role in promoting lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ET. As a result of TBK1 regulating the phosphorylation level of RIPK3, overexpressed TBK1 could enhance the tolerance of macrophages to endotoxin through glutaminolysis. Overall, these findings reveal a novel mechanism for the metabolic control of inflammation and for the induction of ET by modulating glutamine metabolism.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatabolism 3acatalytic activity 3aendotoxins 3aglutamate dehydrogenase 3aglutamine 3aimmunology 3ainflammation 3alipopolysaccharides 3amacrophages 3aphosphorylation 0aTBK1 0aEndotoxin tolerance 0aSepsis 0aRIPK3 0aGLUD1 0aα-KG1 aYang, Lian1 aYi, Zhujun1 aZhang, Wenfeng1 aGong, Jianping0 tMolecular immunology.g2022 July, v. 147 p.101-114dElsevier LtdwJournal:12510x0161-58907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molimm.2022.04.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02544naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245014600168500002200314520085800336592002801194650002101222650002401243650002101267650000901288650002401297650001601321650002101337650001901358650002001377650001401397650001001411650001701421651001001438651001101448651001101459651001201470651001001482651001401492651001201506651001801518653001801536653001601554653002401570653002101594653001001615700002101625700005401646700002101700700003401721773012901755856008501884852000901969655001201978IND60625299120221120125130.0190417e20181130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062529912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jarmap.2018.11.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, Rajesh10aRadiofrequency cold plasma treatment enhances seed germination and seedling growth in variety CIM-Saumya of sweet basil (Ocimum basilicum L.)  aPre-press version  aRadiofrequency room temperature plasma method is a newly emerging physical seed treatment method for enhanced germination of various crops. The stimulatory effect of plasma exposure on sweet basil (Ocimum basilicum L.) has been investigated. It is an oil-bearing aromatic crop cultivated in Indonesia, Egypt, Morocco, France, India, Greece, USA, and Hungary. Cold plasma seed exposure with different RF power such as T2 (30 W), T3 (90 W), T4 (150 W), T5 (210 W) and T6 (270 W) was applied to work out its effect on seed. The T4 (150 W) cold plasma treatment had the highest stimulatory effect on germination and vigor among all the studied doses of treatments. Increase in the germination and seedling vigor of sweet basil might be a consequence of the increases in water uptake, seed reserve mobilization and depletion rate at T4 treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOcimum basilicum 3aambient temperature 3aapplied research 3acold 3aessential oil crops 3aradio waves 3aseed germination 3aseed treatment 3aseedling growth 3aseedlings 3avigor 3awater uptake 3aEgypt 3aFrance 3aGreece 3aHungary 3aIndia 3aIndonesia 3aMorocco 3aUnited States 0aEssential oil 0aGermination 0aOcimum basilicum L. 0aPlasma treatment 0aVigor1 aPrasad, Priyanka1 aRam Mohan,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2442-70011 aVerma, Mahesh K.1 aKumar, B.q(Birendra),d1935-0 tJournal of applied research on medicinal and aromatic plants.g2018 Nov. 30, dElsevier GmbHwJournal:23209x2214-78617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jarmap.2018.11.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02549naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100001700137245012900154300001800283520132900301650002601630650001801656650001301674650001001687650002201697650002201719650001201741650002001753650002401773650001701797650000901814650002101823650001901844650001901863700001501882700001601897700001501913773016201928856004002090852000902130655001202139IND4534976520221119084923.0150914s2014    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND453497652DNAL7 a10.1021/jf500472b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSitu, Wenbei10aResistant Starch Film-Coated Microparticles for an Oral Colon-Specific Polypeptide Delivery System and Its Release Behaviors  ap. 3599-3609.  aFor the delivery of bioactive components to the colon, an oral colon-specific controlled release system coated with a resistant starch-based film through aqueous dispersion coating process was developed. Starch was modified by a high-temperature-pressure reaction, enzymatic debranching, and retrogradation, resulting in a dramatic increase in the resistibility against enzymatic digestion (meaning the formation of resistant starch, specifically RS3). This increase could be associated with an increase in the relative crystallinity, a greater amount of starch molecular aggregation structure, and the formation of a compact mass fractal structure, resulting from the treatment. The microparticles coated with this RS3 film showed an excellent controlled release property. In streptozotocin (STZ)-induced type II diabetic rats, the RS3 film-coated insulin-loaded microparticles exhibited the ability to steadily decrease the plasma glucose level initially and then maintain the plasma glucose level within the normal range for total 14-22 h with different insulin dosages after oral administration; no glycopenia or glycemic fluctuation was observed. Therefore, the potential of this new RS3 film-coated microparticle system has been demonstrated for the accurate delivery of bioactive polypeptides or protein to the colon. 3aanimal disease models 3ablood glucose 3acoatings 3acolon 3acrystal structure 3adiabetes mellitus 3ainsulin 3amodified starch 3aoral administration 3apolypeptides 3arats 3aresistant starch 3aretrogradation 3astreptozotocin1 aChen, Ling1 aWang, Xueyu1 aLi, Xiaoxi0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2014 Apr. 23, v. 62, no. 16 p.3599-3609dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Divisionx0021-85617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf500472b  aDNAL 7aarticle02357naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245018200166300001600348520106900364592002801433650001301461650002201474650001201496650001401508650002201522650001301544650001301557650001501570650002001585650001501605650002001620700002901640700003101669700003801700700002901738773010201767856008101869852000901950655001201959IND60465878520221119114952.0151123e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6046587852DNAL7 a10.1007/s10709-015-9868-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSunny, Armando10aGenetic diversity and genetic structure of an endemic Mexican Dusky Rattlesnake (Crotalus triseriatus) in a highly modified agricultural landscape: implications for conservation  ap. 705-716.  aIt is necessary to determine genetic diversity of fragmented populations in highly modified landscapes to understand how populations respond to land-use change. This information will help guide future conservation and management strategies. We conducted a population genetic study on an endemic Mexican Dusky Rattlesnake (Crotalus triseriatus) in a highly modified landscape near the Toluca metropolitan area, in order to provide crucial information for the conservation of this species. There was medium levels of genetic diversity, with a few alleles and genotypes. We identified three genetically differentiated clusters, likely as a result of different habitat cover type. We also found evidence of an ancestral genetic bottleneck and medium values of effective population size. Inbreeding coefficients were low and there was a moderate gene flow. Our results can be used as a basis for future research and C. triseriatus conservation efforts, particularly considering that the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt is heavily impacted by destructive land-use practices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCrotalus 3aagricultural land 3aalleles 3agene flow 3agenetic variation 3agenotype 3ahabitats 3ainbreeding 3aland use change 3alandscapes 3apopulation size1 aMonroy Vilchis, Octavio,1 aZarco-González, Martha M.1 aMendoza Martínez, Germán David,1 aMartínez-Gómez, Daniel0 tGenetica.g2015 Dec., v. 143, no. 6 p.705-716dSpringer International Publishingx0016-67077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10709-015-9868-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03559naa a2200817 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245009500169500002200264520142200286592002801708650001301736650001401749650002101763650001201784650001001796650001401806650002401820650001901844650002401863650001501887650001101902650001901913650001001932650001501942650001701957650001301974650001301987650001202000650002102012650001402033650004102047650001402088650001102102650001302113650002602126650001202152650001602164650001702180650002602197650001202223653000902235653000902244653001002253653001002263653000802273653000802281653000702289653000702296653000902303653000802312653000802320653000702328653000802335653002602343653002002369653002102389653002502410653001602435700001602451700002302467700001602490773012902506856008502635852000902720655001202729IND60625299220221120105049.0190417e20181127xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062529922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jarmap.2018.11.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThakur, Menaka10aImproving production of plant secondary metabolites through biotic and abiotic elicitation  aPre-press version  aPlants need to counter continuous threats posed by the environment, such as pathogen attacks (fungi, viruses, insects, nematodes) and harsh physical conditions (drought, salinity, temperature, exposure to UV radiation). Plants recognize the threat signals through their receptors and sensors and activate defense responses to stabilize against these stresses. The responses include accumulation of secondary metabolites. Enhanced synthesis of secondary metabolites, called elicitation ensures the survival, persistence and competitiveness of the plant. Secondary metabolites include volatile oils, flavonoids, alkaloids, glycosides, tannins, resins etc that have been successfully exploited for vital sources for food additives, flavors, and industrially important pharmaceuticals. The improved production of the secondary metabolites through elicitation has unlocked a new area of research that could have significant economic benefits for the pharmaceutical and therapeutic (including neutraceutical) industry. The present review discusses about the different elicitation methods through various biotic (proteins, carbohydrates, plant growth promoting rhizobacteria, fungus, hormones) and abiotic elicitors (heavy metals, low and high temperature, light, salt, drought) that could bring about increased yield of secondary metabolites especially in medicinal plants beneficial to the medicinal and aromatic industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNematoda 3aalkaloids 3aapplied research 3adrought 3adrugs 3aelicitors 3aessential oil crops 3aessential oils 3afinancial economics 3aflavonoids 3aflavor 3afood additives 3afungi 3aglycosides 3aheavy metals 3ahormones 3aindustry 3ainsects 3amedicinal plants 3apathogens 3aplant growth-promoting rhizobacteria 3areceptors 3aresins 3asalinity 3asecondary metabolites 3atannins 3atemperature 3atherapeutics 3aultraviolet radiation 3aviruses 0aOGAs 0aPGPR 0aePGPR 0aiPGPR 0aAMF 0aGA3 0aSA 0aJA 0aMeJA 0aSpd 0aSpm 0aUV 0aPEG 0aSecondary metabolites 0aBiotic elicitor 0aAbiotic elicitor 0aPhytopharmaceuticals 0aElicitation1 aMadhushree,1 aKhosla, Prem Kumar1 aPuri, Sunil0 tJournal of applied research on medicinal and aromatic plants.g2018 Nov. 27, dElsevier GmbHwJournal:23209x2214-78617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jarmap.2018.11.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03332naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100001400137245008400151300001800235520158300253650002201836650002001858650001901878650003001897650002301927650001301950650001301963650001201976650001101988650001001999650001202009650002302021650001802044650001602062650001802078650001902096650001802115650002802133650001902161650002302180650001702203650001102220650001402231650001302245650001002258650001602268651001102284700002002295700001902315700002502334700002302359700002102382700002302403700001902426700002002445700001802465773016202483856004002645852000902685655001202694IND4534976620221119085114.0150914s2014    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND453497662DNAL7 a10.1021/jf500048t2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSuqi, Liu10aInsecticidal Activity of Bio-oil from the Pyrolysis of Straw from Brassica spp.  ap. 3610-3618.  aAgricultural crop residues can be converted through thermochemical pyrolysis to bio-oil, a sustainable source of biofuel and biochemicals. The pyrolysis bio-oil is known to contain many chemicals, some of which have insecticidal activity and can be a potential source of value-added pest control products. Brassicacae crops, cabbage, broccoli, and mustards, contain glucosinolates and isocyanates, compounds with recognized anti-herbivore activity. In Canada, canola Brassica napus straw is available from over 6â000â000 ha and mustard Brassica carinata and Brassica juncea straw is available from 200â000 ha. The straw can be converted by microbial lignocellulosic enzymes as a substrate for bioethanol production but can also be converted to bio-oil by thermochemical means. Straw from all three species was pyrolyzed, and the insecticidal components in the bio-oil were isolated by bioassay-guided solvent fractionation. Of particular interest were the mustard straw bio-oil aqueous fractions with insecticidal and feeding repellent activity to Colorado potato beetle larvae. Aqueous fractions further analyzed for active compounds were found not to contain many of the undesirable phenol compounds, which were previously found in other bio-oils seen in the dichloromethane (DCM) and ethyl acetate (EA) solvent phases of the present study. Identified within the most polar fractions were hexadecanoic and octadecanoic fatty acids, indicating that separation of these compounds during bio-oil production may provide a source of effective insecticidal compounds. 3aBrassica carinata 3aBrassica juncea 3aBrassica napus 3aLeptinotarsa decemlineata 3aactive ingredients 3abiofuels 3abroccoli 3acabbage 3acanola 3acrops 3aenzymes 3aethanol production 3aethyl acetate 3afatty acids 3afractionation 3aglucosinolates 3ainsect larvae 3ainsecticidal properties 3alignocellulose 3amethylene chloride 3apest control 3aphenol 3apyrolysis 3asolvents 3astraw 3avalue added 3aCanada1 aCáceres, Luis,1 aSchieck, Katie1 aBooker, Christina J.1 aMcGarvey, Brian M.1 aYeung, Ken K.

In this study, RAP's effects to enhance the recovery of cyclophosphamide (Cy)-suppressed bone marrow and blood cells is confirmed in vivo first. Confocal micrographs demonstrated the interesting direct binding of FITC-RAP to hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) in bone marrow. RAP protects both mice and human HSC in terms of cell morphology, proliferation, and apoptosis. RNA-sequencing and shRNA approaches revealed FOS to be a key regulator in RAP's protection. These evidences provide an unreported mechanism that RAP directly protects hematopoietic stem cells from chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression by increasing FOS expression.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3abone marrow 3acell structures 3acyclophosphamide 3ahematopoiesis 3ahumans 3apolysaccharides 3asequence analysis 0aAstragalus polysaccharide 0aMyelosuppression 0aProtective effect 0aHematopoietic stem cell 0aFOS1 aZhang, Quanwei1 aZheng, Hongming1 aLi, Lifeng1 aLiu, Man1 aCheng, Huiyuan1 aWong, Tinlong1 aZhang, Ge1 aLu, Aiping1 aBian, Zhaoxiang1 aMa, Diklung1 aLeung, Chunghang1 aHan, Quanbin0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2021 July 31, v. 183 p.1715-1722dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2021.05.1203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02527naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003600135040001800171100002800189245006300217300001600280506007600296520117200372592002801544506003701572650001201609650003701621650002401658650001101682650001201693650001101705650003201716650002301748650004101771650002401812650002201836700002101858700002201879700002101901773008001922856008202002852000902084655001202093IND60092517620221207083711.0141103e20110107xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009251762DNAL7 a212153742pmid7 aPMC30354792pmcid7 a10.1016/j.cell.2010.12.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aO'Shaughnessy, Ellen C.10aTunable Signal Processing in Synthetic MAP Kinase Cascades  ap. 119-131.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe flexibility of MAPK cascade responses enables regulation of a vast array of cell fate decisions, but elucidating the mechanisms underlying this plasticity is difficult in endogenous signaling networks. We constructed insulated mammalian MAPK cascades in yeast to explore how intrinsic and extrinsic perturbations affect the flexibility of these synthetic signaling modules. Contrary to biphasic dependence on scaffold concentration, we observe monotonic decreases in signal strength as scaffold concentration increases. We find that augmenting the concentration of sequential kinases can enhance ultrasensitivity and lower the activation threshold. Further, integrating negative regulation and concentration variation can decouple ultrasensitivity and threshold from the strength of the response. Computational analyses show that cascading can generate ultrasensitivity and that natural cascades with different kinase concentrations are innately biased toward their distinct activation profiles. This work demonstrates that tunable signal processing is inherent to minimal MAPK modules and elucidates principles for rational design of synthetic signaling systems.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3amammals 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3asignal transduction 3ayeasts 2aAnimals 2aHumans 2aMAP Kinase Signaling System 2aModels, Biological 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexmetabolism 2aSignal Transduction 2aSynthetic Biology1 aPalani, Santhosh1 aCollins, James J.1 aSarkar, Casim A.0 tCell.g2011 Jan. 7, v. 144, no. 1 p.119-131dElsevier Inc.x0092-86747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2010.12.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03052naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001800164245012500182300001600307500001500323520125300338592002801591650001201619650001201631650003701643650001701680650002201697650001601719650001901735650001301754650001101767650001601778650002901794650001201823650001801835650001301853650001001866650003601876650001201912650004001924650002601964650005501990650003002045650002502075650002602100653002402126700001702150700003002167700001702197700001502214700002802229773011402257852000902371856008202380655001202462IND4424024820221118235533.0180619e200908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442402482DNAL7 a193404632pmid7 a10.1007/s00572-009-0238-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCampagnac, E.10aFenpropimorph slows down the sterol pathway and the development of the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus Glomus intraradices  ap. 365-374.  a2019-12-06  aThe direct impact of fenpropimorph on the sterol biosynthesis pathway of Glomus intraradices when extraradical mycelia alone are in contact with the fungicide was investigated using monoxenic cultures. Bi-compartmental Petri plates allowed culture of mycorrhizal chicory roots in a compartment without fenpropimorph and exposure of extraradical hyphae to the presence of increasing concentrations of fenpropimorph (0, 0.02, 0.2, 2, 20 mg l⁻¹). In the fungal compartment, sporulation, hyphal growth, and fungal biomass were already reduced at the lowest fungicide concentration. A decrease in total sterols, in addition to an increase in the amount of squalene and no accumulation of abnormal sterols, suggests that the sterol pathway is severely slowed down or that squalene epoxidase was inhibited by fenpropimorph in G. intraradices. In the root compartment, neither extraradical and intraradical development of the arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungus nor root growth was affected when they were not in direct contact with the fungicide; only hyphal length was significantly affected at 2 mg l⁻¹ of fenpropimorph. Our results clearly demonstrate a direct impact of fenpropimorph on the AM fungus by a perturbation of its sterol metabolism.  aPublisher supplied data 3asterols 3achicory 3avesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae 3abiosynthesis 3amycorrhizal fungi 3asporulation 3adirect contact 3asqualene 3ahyphae 3aroot growth 3aRhizophagus intraradices 3abiomass 3afenpropimorph 3amycelium 3aroots 2aAntifungal Agentsxpharmacology 2aBiomass 2aBiosynthetic Pathwaysxdrug effects 2aChicoryxmicrobiology 2aGlomeromycotaxdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 2aMorpholinesxpharmacology 2aSqualenexmetabolism 2aSterolsxbiosynthesis 0aGlomus intraradices1 aFontaine, J.1 aLounès-Hadj Sahraoui, A.1 aLaruelle, F.1 aDurand, R.1 aGrandmougin-Ferjani, A.0 tMycorrhiza.g2009 Aug., v. 19, no. 6 p.365-374dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl58547x0940-63607nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00572-009-0238-13Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02744naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245012700168300001400295500001500309520135500324592002801679650002201707650001701729650002601746650001501772650001401787650001901801650001301820650000701833650001501840650001701855650001601872650002001888653002001908653002901928653002801957653002701985653001302012653002002025700001802045700002002063700001902083773010002102856005102202852000902253655001202262IND50076497620221119171835.0140410e20130201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007649762DNAL7 a10.1080/08905436.2012.7556932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Xuebin10aHigh-Efficient Expression and Pilot Scale Fermentation of Streptomyces Xylanase from a Constitutive Pichia pastoris Vector  ap. 54-65.  a2019-12-05  aTo develop an efficient Streptomyces xylanase-expressing system necessary for large-scale industrial production, a DNA fragment encoding the endo-β-l,4-xylanase (XYL1) from Streptomyces sp. S38 was cloned into an expression vector pGAPZαA to generate a recombinant plasmid pGAPZαA-XYL1. The plasmid pGAPZαA-XYL1 was transformed into Pichia pastoris X-33. The secreted XYL1 protein was confirmed to be completely consistent to sequence as reported previously (GenBank accession number X98518.1). The secreted XYL1 protein was purified using the Q-Sepharose FF chromatography and Sephadex G-25 resin, with an estimated purity of greater than 90%. We also found that in a 50 L fermentor, the average level and enzymatic activity of secreted xylanases were up to 1.15 ± 0.09 mg/mL and 1528 ± 59 IU/mL, respectively. The pH and temperature for optimal XYL1 expression were 6.0 and 55°C, respectively. The Km and Vmax values of XYL1 were 2.0 mg/mL and 5000 μmol min⁻¹ mg⁻¹, respectively. In addition, the XYL1 was found to have good thermal stability and wide pH adaptability, suggesting that it may be a useful candidate for various commercial applications. The high-efficient expression and pilot scale fermentation of XYL1 in this study, together with enzymatic studies, provide a strong basis for future large-scale industrial production.  aPublisher supplied data 3athermal stability 3afermentation 3aKomagataella pastoris 3afermenters 3axylanases 3achromatography 3aplasmids 3apH 3agene banks 3aStreptomyces 3atemperature 3aenzyme activity 0aPichia pastoris 0apilot scale fermentation 0aconstitutive expression 0aenzyme characteristics 0axylanase 0aStreptomyces sp1 aLin, Jiancong1 aLiang, Shizhong1 aZhang, Minjing0 tFood biotechnology.g2013 Feb. 1, v. 27, no. 1 p.54-65dTaylor & Francis Groupx1532-42497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08905436.2012.755693  aDNAL 7aarticle03615naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001600143245012400159300001800283520177200301592002802073650002102101650002302122650001702145650001102162650001602173650000902189650002002198650003202218650001602250650001802266650002002284650001602304650001602320650001902336650002602355650002402381650001902405650000902424650001902433650001302452650001402465650001602479650001302495650002902508650002302537653002502560653001402585653002802599653001802627700001702645700002002662700002402682700002202706700002102728773015302749856007802902852000902980655001202989IND60539585420221119205252.0190318e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053958542DNAL7 a10.3168/jds.2015-93422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Lina10aPerspective on calf and mammary gland development through changes in the bovine milk proteome over a complete lactation  ap. 5362-5373.  aMilk contains all the nutrients for the growth and development of the neonate. However, milk composition is not constant during lactation. To study the changes of the milk proteome over lactation, filter-aided sample preparation combined with dimethyl labeling followed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry was used to identify and quantify milk proteins from 4 cows. A total of 229 proteins were identified, of which 219 were quantified. An 80% overlap was found in identified and quantified proteins between the 4 individual cows during lactation. Over lactation, the number of quantified proteins changed slightly (less than 10%), whereas the concentration of proteins changed considerably. Transport proteins involved in lipid synthesis (fatty acid–binding protein, perilipin-2, butyrophilin) increased, whereas proteins related to cholesterol transport (apolipoprotein E) decreased. The changes of lipid synthesis proteins are in accordance with the increased milk fat yield over lactation, indicating the increase of de novo mammary fatty acid synthesis as lactation advances. The high abundance of immune-related proteins in early lactation indicates the important role of these proteins for immune system development of calves. The increase in immune-related proteins (immunoglobulins, osteopontin, lactoferrin) and the decrease of proteins related to milk component synthesis (α-lactalbumin, β-lactoglobulin, fatty acid–binding protein, perilipin-2, butyrophilin) in late lactation can be associated with the protection of the mammary gland. In conclusion, the changes of proteins with different biological functions reflect not only the changing needs of calves but also the development and protection of the mammary gland over lactation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapolipoprotein E 3abeta-lactoglobulin 3abutyrophilin 3acalves 3acholesterol 3acows 3aearly lactation 3afatty acid-binding proteins 3afatty acids 3aimmune system 3aimmunoglobulins 3alactalbumin 3alactoferrin 3alate lactation 3aliquid chromatography 3amammary development 3amammary glands 3amilk 3amilk fat yield 3aneonates 3anutrients 3aosteopontin 3aproteome 3atandem mass spectrometry 3atransport proteins 0abovine milk proteome 0alactation 0aimmune-related proteins 0amammary gland1 aBoeren, Sjef1 aHageman, Jos A.1 avan Hooijdonk, Toon1 aVervoort, Jacques1 aHettinga, Kasper0 tJournal of dairy science.g2015 Aug., v. 98, no. 8 p.5362-5373dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2015-93423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03074naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245016100165300001600326520160000342592002801942650002701970650001501997650001402012650001502026650002002041650002202061650001502083650001702098650002802115650001302143650001802156650001802174653001902192653003102211653001502242653003602257653002902293700001402322700001402336700001602350700001502366700002402381773009602405856008202501852000902583655001202592IND60091643120221122031841.0161021e20130415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009164312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2012.11.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Xiaoxiao10aRapid and ultrasensitive Salmonella Typhimurium quantification using positive dielectrophoresis driven on-line enrichment and fluorescent nanoparticleslabel  ap. 460-466.  aThis paper describes a convenient and sensitive methodology for Salmonella Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) detection in microfluidic channels using positive dielectrophoresis (pDEP) driven on-line enrichment and fluorescent nanoparticles label. In the protocol, S. Typhimurium was first incubated with the anti-S. Typhimurium antibody conjugated RuBpy-doped fluorescent nanoparticles (AbS. Typhimurium-FNPs). After incubation, the reacted mixture of S. Typhimurium and AbS. Typhimurium-FNPs bioconjugates was directly introduced into the pDEP-based microfluidic system. On applying an AC voltage to the electrodes in a pDEP frequency region, the FNPs labeled S. Typhimurium cells moved to the electrodes and accumulated in the electrode gap, while the free AbS. Typhimurium-FNPs were flowed away. The enriched FNPs labeled S. Typhimurium were detected by fluorescence microscopy at the focused detection areas. This new method constructed a simultaneous on-line enrichment and detection platform, eliminated the separation and washing-out steps usually required for FNPs label involved bioassay. Utilizing signal amplification effects produced by pDEP on-line enrichment and FNPs label, the detection limit for S. Typhimurium in deionized water is 56 colony forming units per milliliter (cfu/mL). We applied the established approach to detecting artificially contaminated bottled mineral water samples; S. Typhimurium of 110cfu/mL was accurately detected. It is believed that the proposed method will find wide applications in biomedicine fields demanding higher sensitive bacterial identification.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalmonella Typhimurium 3aantibodies 3abioassays 3abiosensors 3adetection limit 3adielectrophoresis 3aelectrodes 3afluorescence 3afluorescence microscopy 3amedicine 3amineral water 3ananoparticles 0aS.

In this work, we designed a fluidized-bed photocatalytic reactor using H₂S simultaneously as the bubbling gas for catalyst suspension and as the feed for hydrogen production. The photocatalyst distribution was simulated by CFD with a Eulerian model. The simulation results indicated that the fluidizing time showed a linear relationship with the inlet gas velocity and that the optimal inlet gas velocity was between 30 and 50 mL/min. Further, light energy absorption characteristics, in both homogeneous and heterogeneous media, were simulated by the Monte Carlo method. Our study showed that light energy absorption is affected by the nonuniform distribution of the catalyst particles and that finding the optimum optical thickness in chemical reaction space and the optimal height for catalyst fluidization is essential for reactor design. The simulation results and the related predictions are helpful for the design and optimization of fluidized-bed photocatalytic reactors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMonte Carlo method 3aabsorption 3aenergy 3aengineering 3afluidized beds 3ahydrogen production 3ahydrogen sulfide 3amathematical models 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3aprediction1 aJing, Li1 aLiu, Huan1 aYao, Song1 aGuo, Liejin0 tIndustrial & Engineering Chemistry Research.g2013 Feb. 06, v. 52, no. 5 p.1982-1991dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fie30231273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02624naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003800147245011700185300001400302520127300316592002801589650002501617650003001642650001501672650001501687650001301702650001101715650001301726650001001739650001601749650001701765650001601782650000901798650001301807650001601820650001001836650001401846650002201860700003301882700005701915773011601972856008102088852000902169655001202178IND60555574820221122230332.0161029e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055557482DNAL7 a10.1007/s11240-016-1025-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlfaro Saldaña, Elvia Francisca,10aGeneration of transformed roots of Scirpus americanus Pers. and study of their potential to remove Pb2+ and Cr3+  ap. 15-24.  aIn vitro root cultures of Scirpus americanus are capable to remove heavy metals. To improve metal uptake, this work focused on the production of transformed roots with the strain A4 of Agrobacterium rhizogenes containing the agropine-type plasmid pRiA4 and the binary vector pESC4. Materials used as explants included in vitro root cultures, seedlings grown under hydroponic conditions, and in vitro seedlings. Infection of in vitro root cultures failed to produce hairy roots, while the infection of greenhouse and in vitro seedlings induced 84 and 67 % GUS-positive hairy roots, respectively. From 31 clones obtained, clones T11, T12 and T14 expressed the genes nptII and rol B. As T12 exhibited a faster growth, it was selected for metal-uptake experiments. Clone T12 grown in the presence of metals removed 3.8 and 1.2 times more Pb and Cr, respectively, than non-transformed roots, suggesting that this clone displays more efficient tolerance mechanisms to Pb and Cr. Metal absorption was 4–6 fold higher than adsorption. Transgenic plants were regenerated from in vitro root cultures of clone T12. The use of hairy roots and transformed plants of S. americanus could provide an alternative strategy for the remediation of water contaminated with heavy metals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRhizobium rhizogenes 3aSchoenoplectus americanus 3aabsorption 3aadsorption 3achromium 3aclones 3aexplants 3agenes 3agreenhouses 3aheavy metals 3ahydroponics 3alead 3aplasmids 3aremediation 3aroots 3aseedlings 3atransgenic plants1 aPérez-Molphe-Balch, Eugenio1 aSantos Díaz, Ma. del Socorroq(María del Socorro),0 tPlant cell, tissue, and organ culture.g2016 Oct., v. 127, no. 1 p.15-24dSpringer Netherlandsx0167-68577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11240-016-1025-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02716naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002400152245008800176300001600264520118100280592002801461650002801489650001501517650001701532650002001549650000901569650002401578650001201602650001701614650001301631650001801644650001501662650001101677650001601688650001101704650002701715653001101742653001901753653003101772653003401803700002901837700002201866700002201888700001601910700002001926700002101946773013501967856008702102852000902189655001202198IND60676117720221122113431.0200217e20200301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067611772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2019.10.0472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChronopoulou, Laura10aNoble metal nanoparticle-based networks as a new platform for lipase immobilization  ap. 790-797.  aEnzyme immobilization on nanocarriers is nowadays considered a useful tool for improving activity and maintaining biocatalysts stability while facilitating their recovery and reuse. In this work we prepared Au and Ag based nanoparticles (AuNPs or AgNPs) stabilized with two different ligands, the organometallic dinuclear complex trans,trans-[dithiodibis(tributylphosphine)diplatinum(II)-4,4′-diethynylbiphenyl] (Pt-DEBP) and the organic dithiol 4,4′-dithiol-biphenyl (BI), able to link the NPs in 3D networks. We investigated the ability of these nanocarriers to interact with a model lipolytic enzyme from Pseudomonas fluorescens and maintain its activity, both in aqueous as well as in organic media. In particular, our results highlighted that the nature of the metal plays a role in enzyme adsorption, while enzyme activity is mostly influenced by the chemistry of the organic spacer. The obtained bioconjugate, between lipase and the most promising carrier, AgNPs-Pt-DEBP, was stable in a wide temperature range (25–55 °C) and it showed good activity retention both in aqueous (50%) as well as in organic media (75%), compared to the lipase used in soluble form.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPseudomonas fluorescens 3aadsorption 3abiocatalysts 3aenzyme activity 3agold 3aimmobilized enzymes 3aligands 3ananocarriers 3ananogold 3ananoparticles 3ananosilver 3asilver 3atemperature 3athiols 3atriacylglycerol lipase 0aLipase 0aImmobilization 0aNoble metals nanoparticles 0aAgNPs and AuNPs based network1 aScaramuzzo, Francesca A.1 aFioravanti, Raoul1 adi Nitto, Antonio1 aCerra, Sara1 aPalocci, Cleofe1 aFratoddi, Ilaria0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2020 Mar. 01, v. 146 p.790-797dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2019.10.0473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02782naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001200140245011500152300001800267520150200285592002801787650001601815650001601831650002401847650004301871650001101914650001501925650001601940650001501956650002901971650001402000700001502014700001402029700001602043700001502059700001402074700001602088700001702104700001602121773012802137856007402265852000902339655001202348IND60638333420221117222109.0190429e20160310xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063833342DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ay01526j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Xin10aSimultaneous analysis of 25OHD₃ and 24,25(OH)₂D₃ both in human serum and cerebrospinal fluid by LC-MS/MS  ap. 2400-2407.  aAs a pleiotropic hormone, vitamin D (VD) is not only involved in bone health, but also associated with various disorders. Determination of circulating 25OHD₃ is routinely used to measure the status of VD, however previously reported methods exhibited various defects in accuracy, sensitivity, rapidness and simplicity in the analysis of VD and its metabolites. We present here a validated method for the simultaneous analysis of 25OHD₃ and 24,25(OH)₂D₃ both in low volumes of serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) with high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) using a deuterated internal standard. Serum and CSF samples were simply processed by protein precipitation and derivatized with 4-phenyl-1,2,4-triazoline-3,5-dione (PTAD) to enhance their responses and sensitivity. Separation was conducted using a gradient program on a Thermo Accucore C18 column. Mass spectrometry was operated using electrospray ionization (ESI) in the positive ion and multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode. The method exhibited excellent linearity with correlation coefficients above 0.99. The lower limits of quantification (LLOQ) for 25OHD₃ and 24,25(OH)₂D₃ were 0.10 and 0.25 ng mL⁻¹, respectively. Intra-day precision ranged from 1.4% to 9.7% and inter-day precision ranged from 1.9% to 10.0% for both 25OHD₃ and 24,25(OH)₂D₃. This method is precise, sensitive and simple, which is practical for the study of VD and its metabolites in human serum and CSF.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood serum 3abone health 3acerebrospinal fluid 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahumans 3aionization 3ametabolites 3amonitoring 3atandem mass spectrometry 3avitamin D1 aJiang, Pei1 aXue, Ying1 aZhu, Wen-Ye1 aDeng, Yang1 aYan, Miao1 aLi, Huan-De1 aDang, Rui-Li1 aTang, Mi-Mi0 tAnalytical methods.g2016 Mar. 10, v. 8, no. 11 p.2400-2407dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ay01526j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01362naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001900138245008900157300001600246520026500262592002800527650001700555650001700572650004400589650003400633650001300667650001800680700001900698700002300717700002800740700001900768700001800787773012600805856007200931852000901003655001201012IND60658057920221121025541.0190816e20070220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065805792DNAL7 a10.1039/b614172b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPiña, M.

Sixty species were recorded in flocks that contained 2––24 species each (mean == 9.25 ±± 0.29 SE). Flocks contained 2––181 individuals (mean == 22.12 ±± 1.18 SE). Flocks in the six habitats had 49––61%% Nearctic-Neotropical migrant individuals, 5––15%% temperate migrants, and 23––37%% residents. Abundance and species richness of migratory guilds (Nearctic-Neotropical migrants, temperate migrants, and resident species) within flocks were highest in structurally heterogeneous habitats (especially forest edge habitat) and were lowest in homogeneous pole stage forest. Of nine migrant species whose abundance varied significantly among habitats, six had highest abundance in flocks in forest edge habitat: Blue-headed Vireo (Vireo solitarius), Red-eyed Vireo (V. olivaceus), Blue-gray Gnatcatcher (Polioptila caerulea), Chestnut-sided Warbler (Dendroica pensylvanica), Black-throated Green Warbler (D. virens), and Magnolia Warbler (D. magnolia). Resident parids (Black-capped Chickadee, Poecile atricapillus, and/or Tufted Titmouse, Baeolophus bicolor) occurred within 82%% of flocks and were observed leading 68%% of these flocks. Movement rate (m/min) of flocks varied among habitats with flocks in edge-dominated habitats (forest edge, forest agricultural edge, and suburban forest) tending to have slower movement rates than in pole stage forest and forest interior, suggesting that food availability may have been greater in edge-dominated habitats. Consistently high species richness and abundance of migrant guilds and individual species strongly suggests that structurally diverse forest edge habitats were selected and provided relatively high quality stopover habitat for landbirds during fall migration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBaeolophus bicolor 3aPoecile atricapillus 3aedge effects 3aflocks 3afood availability 3aforests 3ahabitat preferences 3ahabitats 3ainsectivores 3amigratory behavior 3ashrubs 3aspecies diversity 3aPennsylvania1 aBRITTINGHAM, MARGARET C.0 tWilson bulletin.g2002 Mar., v. 114, no. 1 p.87-98dWilson Ornithological Societyx0043-56437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1676%2F0043-5643%282002%29114%5B0087%3AHUABOM%5D2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02762naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245013700169300001600306520181400322592002802136650001502164650001502179650002502194700002202219700001902241700002002260773010202280856008102382852000902463655001202472IND60575331620221118200810.0170728e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057533162DNAL7 a10.1007/s10669-017-9624-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDe Nardo, Matheus10aSocial signals and sustainability: ambiguity about motivations can affect status perceptions of efficiency and curtailment behaviors  ap. 184-197.  aPerceived status can affect the diffusion of pro-environmental behaviors and sustainable consumption. However, the status of different forms of sustainable consumption has not been adequately explored. Previous studies suggest that curtailment behaviors are associated with low or neutral status, while efficiency behaviors are associated with high status. However, these studies have generally examined a small number of behaviors. Drawing from costly signaling theory, we developed a mixed methods study to explore whether and why pro-environmental behaviors are perceived to be associated with high or low status, the perceived motivation for those behaviors, and the relationship between motivation and status. We conducted structured, interactive interviews with 71 participants to explore perceptions of 19 behaviors. Using quantitative and qualitative analyses, we find that efficiency is rated higher status than curtailment largely due to monetary considerations. Efficiency is also perceived to be motivated by environmental concern to a greater degree than curtailment. Understanding the motivation for behaviors clarifies the social signal because it provides insights into whether one is incurring personal costs. Importantly, it is often unclear whether low-cost curtailment behaviors are adopted by choice rather than financial need. Ambiguity about the intentionality of behaviors results in such behaviors being perceived as lower status. Those who argue that curtailment will be necessary for long-term sustainability must address status perceptions because social stigmas could hinder their adoption. Overcoming such stigmas may require, indicating that curtailment behaviors are voluntary, but it may be more effective to use social or economic mechanisms to increase efficiency behaviors.  aPublisher supplied data 3ainterviews 3amotivation 3aqualitative analysis1 aBrooks, Jeremy S.1 aKlinsky, Sonja1 aWilson, Charlie0 tEnvironment systems & decisions.g2017 June, v. 37, no. 2 p.184-197dSpringer USx2194-54037nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10669-017-9624-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03078naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001800155245013400173520163100307592002801938650002301966650001401989650001302003650001702016650001002033650001302043650000902056650001002065650001702075650001502092650001502107650002302122650001602145650001002161650002202171650001502193650001602208650001402224650000902238650001502247651001202262653001702274653001902291700001602310700002002326700001602346773009902362856009002461852000902551655001202560IND60684951220221118164552.0200503e20200630xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068495122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2020.7351732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalamanca, N.10aEndocrine and metabolic effects of Trp-enriched diets for attenuation of chronic stress in the Senegal soles (Solea senegalensis)  aThe objective of this work was to assess the long-term effects of Trp additives on the stress and metabolism of the Senegal sole (Solea senegalensis), in order to check if they produce a chronic stress relief and affect significantly the Trp metabolism. Fish (94.4 ± 0.71 g) were fed Trp-enriched feeds added (1%) or control food; in addition, they were subjected to different photoperiods (natural photoperiod, total darkness and continous light). Plasma, liver, intestine and brain samples were taken after 60 days. The Trp produced a reduction of the biometric parameters, however, it did not affect the length and weight. The photoperiod affected cortisol levels, being reduced in those specimens that were under total darkness with respect to the total light within the control feeding; moreover, cortisol and lactate were reduced in the diet supplemented with Trp and subjected to continuous light. Degradation metabolites of Trp in the different tissues were also determined, showing that the kynurenine pathway, destined to the elimination of excess of Trp, is mostly promoted in liver and intestine. Briefly, it has been demonstrated that the light stress in Senegal sole can be attenuated through Trp supplements, according to the plasma classical stress markers. In addition, the integrative metabolism of Trp has been studied for the first time in fish, providing new insights on Trp and derived metabolites accumulation in tissues. In this sense, as in mammals, the intestine has been shown as the main serotonin store, and the kynurenine formation in tissues also seems to be key under stressing conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSolea senegalensis 3aadditives 3abiometry 3ablood plasma 3abrain 3acortisol 3adiet 3afeeds 3afish feeding 3aintestines 3akynurenine 3akynurenine pathway 3alactic acid 3aliver 3along term effects 3ametabolism 3ametabolites 3aserotonin 3asole 3atryptophan 3aSenegal 0aLight stress 0aSenegales sole1 aMorales, E.1 aRuiz-Azcona, P.1 aHerrera, M.0 tAquaculture.g2020 June 30, v. 523 p.735173-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2020.7351733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02741naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001400155245012400169300001600293520130900309592002801618650002601646650002301672650001501695650001001710650001201720650001801732650001501750650002101765650001401786650001601800650000901816650001601825650001301841650001301854650001901867650001301886653001901899653001001918653001301928653001901941653001501960700002101975700001801996700001802014700001602032773007702048856008902125852000902214655001202223IND60556737120221120093636.0161102e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055673712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2016.08.1292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Fang10aDevelopment of an algal treatment system for Se removal: Effects of light regimes, nutrients, sulfate and hypersalinity  ap. 372-378.  aSelenium (Se) exposure poses potential risks to wildlife at the Salton Sea. Our previous research suggests Chlorella sp. be highly efficient at absorbing and volatilizing Se. In developing an algal treatment system for Se removal, this study further evaluated the performance under the conditions to be encountered in the field using Chlorella pyrenoidosa and Chlorella vulgaris. The results show the algal Se removal efficiency was little affected by photoperiod, yet volatilization became relatively greater in dark/light cycles over a longer term. The rates of Se absorption and volatilization by C. vulgaris were 88% and 77% more, respectively, in the DI water, while C. pyrenoidosa acted oppositely, indicating C. vulgaris will perform better in Se removal if nutrient levels are reduced in advance. The presence of sulfate reduced biomass Se, especially through volatilization, by 8% for C. vulgaris, lessening potential ecotoxicity. Finally, C. vulgaris released biomass Se back to the water column under hypersaline conditions, leading to a 6% increase in water Se concentrations. These results suggest C. vulgaris be the best alga for the treatment of Se laden river water in the Salton Sea area, yet a filtering system is required to prevent Se containing algae from entering food chains.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChlorella pyrenoidosa 3aChlorella vulgaris 3aabsorption 3aalgae 3abiomass 3aecotoxicology 3afood chain 3anutrient content 3anutrients 3aphotoperiod 3arisk 3ariver water 3aselenium 3asulfates 3avolatilization 3awildlife 0aBioremediation 0aAlgae 0aSelenium 0aVolatilization 0aSalton Sea1 aHuang, Jung-Chen1 aZhou, Chuanqi1 aHe, Shengbing1 aZhou, Weili0 tChemosphere.g2016 Dec., v. 164 p.372-378dElsevier Ltdx0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2016.08.1293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02633naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005700094040001800151100002200169245013800191300001500329520133900344592002801683650002401711650002201735650001001757650001301767650002401780650002401804650001301828650001501841650001501856650001901871650001001890650001201900651001601912700001801928700002301946700002401969773010401993856011702097852000902214655001202223IND60131428620221121041346.0151127e200203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013142862DNAL7 a10.1676/0043-5643(2002)114[0099:SFAEHO]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReitsma, Leonard,10aSite fidelity and ephemeral habitat occupancy: northern waterthrush use of puerto rican black mangroves during the nonbreeding season  ap. 99-105.  aWe studied the dispersion of Northern Waterthrushes (Seiurus novaboracensis) in southwestern Puerto Rico during four nonbreeding seasons, 1996––1999. Densities were high (up to 13 birds/ha) on a 3-ha mature black mangrove (Avicennia germinans) study plot, but were significantly lower during periods of high water levels. Individuals exhibited site fidelity within and between seasons. Feeding areas were small (mean == 0.074 ha ±± 0.041 SD) and there was considerable overlap tolerated among conspecifics. Waterthrush density decreased when water submerged their primary foraging substrate: woody debris and pneumatophores. Interannual returns were similar to other Neotropical migrants (mean == 50%%) but site persistence was low due to periodic flooding. In September 1998, hurricane Georges flooded the plot and blew down >90%% of the black mangrove trees. This drastic habitat alteration was followed by a drastic decline in waterthrushes using the study area. Individuals left feeding areas for overnight roost sites in red mangroves (Rhizophora mangle). This latter finding, coupled with site fidelity and high return rates concurrent with low site persistence, suggests that waterthrushes exhibit high plasticity in their use of habitat during the nonbreeding season, but may rely upon mangroves for overwinter survival.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAvicennia germinans 3aRhizophora mangle 3abirds 3aforaging 3ahabitat destruction 3ahabitat preferences 3ahabitats 3ahurricanes 3aphilopatry 3apneumatophores 3atrees 3atropics 3aPuerto Rico1 aHunt, Pamela,1 aBURSON, SHERMAN L.1 aSTEELE, BENJAMIN B.0 tWilson bulletin.g2002 Mar., v. 114, no. 1 p.99-105dWilson Ornithological Societyx0043-56437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1676%2F0043-5643%282002%29114%5B0099%3ASFAEHO%5D2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01727naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001900146245005000165300001600215520056800231592002800799650002400827650001500851650001200866650002100878650001900899650001000918653001900928653002400947653002100971653001600992653001901008700002801027700002601055700002101081700001901102773011901121856008001240852000901320655001201329IND60616755920221122233117.0181020e200804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061675592DNAL7 a10.1177/00405175070839652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKatovic, Drago14aThe Effect of Microwave Drying on Warp Sizing  ap. 353-360.  aThe paper describes our research of microwave usage in drying the size pick-up.

Specific regulatory sequences within the promoter region contribute to the strength, tissue specificity, timing and duration of gene expression. In this study, promoter regions were isolated from 40 different soybean (Glycine max) genes that were grouped into five distinct categories, based on the localization of native gene expression (constitutively expressed genes, root-preferentially expressed genes, seed-preferentially expressed genes), or the associated biological processes of native gene expression (fatty-acid biosynthesis pathway associated genes, and WRKY transcription factor genes). Each of the promoters was placed upstream of the green fluorescent protein coding sequence and promoter functionality was then assessed using transient expression analysis following particle bombardment of lima bean (Phaseolus lunatus) cotyledons, as well as stable expression analysis following Agrobacterium rhizogenes induction of soybean hairy roots. Surprisingly, promoter strength was relatively consistent using the two different validation methods while tissue specific expression was not observed, likely due to a combination of the target tissue, the large amount of DNA that was introduced and minimal epigenetic effects. The differences in gene expression within members of each promoter group indicates that promoters need to be characterized in a transgenic environment, rather than relying on expression predicted using native gene expression profiles. This systematic approach into the characterization of native soybean promoters adds to the knowledge base of soybean gene regulation and the toolbox of promoters for plant biotechnology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aGlycine max 3aPhaseolus lunatus 3aRhizobium rhizogenes 3abiosynthesis 3abiotechnology 3acotyledons 3aepigenetics 3agene expression 3agenes 3agenetically modified organisms 3agreen fluorescent protein 3alima beans 3apromoter regions 3aroots 3asoybeans 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors1 aRushton, Paul J.1 aMcHale, Leah K.1 aGutek, Amanda H.1 aFiner, John J.0 tPlant cell, tissue, and organ culture.g2016 Oct., v. 127, no. 1 p.145-160dSpringer Netherlandsx0167-68577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11240-016-1038-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02522naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245012600157300001800283520119900301592002801500650001101528650001201539650000901551650002001560650003801580650001601618650001301634650001901647650002101666650003301687650001801720650001301738650001801751650001201769650002301781700001901804700002401823700002401847773013301871856007502004852000902079655001202088IND60537624620180405000000.0160809e20130206xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053762462DNAL7 a10.1021/ie30121932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGomez, Elena,10aThermal Analysis and Heat Capacities of 1-Alkyl-3-methylimidazolium Ionic Liquids with NTf2–, TFO–, and DCA– Anions  ap. 2103-2110.  aIonic liquids are good candidates as replacements for current heat-transfer liquids used in industry. For this use, it is important to know their thermal behavior. The melting, freezing, cold crystallization, and glass transition temperatures, together with heat capacities in the temperature range (293.15 to 333.15) K of the ionic liquids 1-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide [CₙMimNTf₂ (n = 2,3,4,6)], 1-hexyl-3-methylimidazolium trifluoromethanesulfonate (C₆MimTFO), and 1-hexyl-3-methylimidazolium dicyanamide (C₆MimDCA), have been determined using differential scanning calorimetry. Three different types of thermal behaviors were found, and in general it was concluded that as the temperature scan rate in the thermal analysis increases, the freezing temperature decreases, and the glass transition and cold crystallization temperatures increase. The heat capacity values of the imidazolium ionic liquids with the bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide anion increase as the alkyl-side chain of the cation increases, and the ionic liquid with this anion has higher heat capacities than their homologues with trifluoromethanesulfonate or dicyanamide as anions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanions 3acations 3acold 3acrystallization 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3aengineering 3afreezing 3afreezing point 3aglass transition 3aglass transition temperature 3aheat transfer 3aindustry 3aionic liquids 3amelting 3athermal properties1 aCalvar, Noelia1 aDominguez, Angeles,1 aA.

Glycerol-3-phosphate 1-O-acyltransferase (GPAT) is a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of glycerolipids, a major component of cellular membranes and extracellular protective layers, such as cuticles in plants. Brassica napus is an economically important crop and cultivated worldwide mostly for its edible oil. The B. napus GPATs (BnGPATs) are insufficiently characterized. Here, we performed genome-wide analysis to identify putative GPATs in B. napus and its diploid progenitors B. rapa and B oleracea. The 32 B. napus BnGPATs are phylogenetically divided into three major groups, cutin, suberin, and diverse ancient groups. Analysis of transcriptomes of different tissues and seeds at different developmental stages revealed the spatial and temporal expression profiles of BnGPATs. The yield and oil quality of B. napus are adversely affected by the necrotrophic fungus, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum. We showed that several BnGPATs, including cutin-related BnGPAT19 and 21, were upregulated in the S. sclerotiorum resistant line. RNAi-mediated suppression of BnGPAT19 and 21 in B. napus resulted in thinner cuticle, leading to rapid water and chlorophyll loss in toluidine blue staining and leaf bleaching assays. In addition, the RNAi plants also developed severe necrotic lesions following fungal inoculation compared to the wild-type plants, indicating that BnGPAT19 and 21 are likely involved in cuticular wax biosynthesis that is critical for initial pathogen defense. Taken together, we provided a comprehensive account of GPATs B. napus and characterized BnGPAT19 and 21 for their potential roles in cuticular wax biosynthesis and defense against fungal pathogens.  aPublisher supplied data  a110000241120180012cState Administration of Foreign Experts Affairs (CN)  a201803D421016cShanxi Provincial Key Research and Development Project (CN)  a20181401cHigher Education Institution Project of Shanxi Province 3aBrassica napus 3aBrassica oleracea 3aBrassica rapa 3aRNA interference 3aSclerotinia sclerotiorum 3aalpha-glycerophosphoric acid 3abiosynthesis 3ableaching 3acell membranes 3achlorophyll 3acooking fats and oils 3acutin 3adevelopmental stages 3adiploidy 3aepicuticular wax 3afungi 3agenes 3agenome-wide association study 3aglycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase 3aleaves 3apathogens 3aphylogeny 3aseeds 3astaining 3asuberin 3atoluidine blue 3atranscriptome1 aSingh, S.

Herein we report the design and synthesis of a new kind of immunosensor based on the benefits of hyperbranched structure. The hyperbranched polyester was grafted to the surface of indium tin oxides glass (ITO) electrode, and the grafting processes were characterized by attentuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). After CEA and horse radish peroxidase (HRP)-labeled antibody-conjugated AuNPs (HRP–Ab2–AuNPs) bioconjugates were immobilized on the surface of the hyperbranched structure-modified electrode, the optimized conditions of the above electrode were investigated. Moreover, the analytical performance of the proposed immunosensor showed a high sensitivity, a linear range from 0.01 to 80ng/mL with a low detection limit of 2.36pg/mL, and good selectivity for CEA. The designed immunoassay system holds great potential for ultrasensitive electrochemical biosensing of other analytes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aantigen detection 3aantigens 3aatomic force microscopy 3adetection limit 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aglass 3aimmunoassays 3aimmunosensors 3aindium tin oxide 3ananogold 3aperoxidase 3apolyesters 3areflectance 0aElectrochemical immunosensor 0aHyperbranched structure 0aCEA detection1 aWang, Xiaobo1 aLu, Liandi1 aZhu, Peiyuan1 aMao, Chun1 aZhao, Haolin1 aSong, Youchao1 aShen, Jian0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2014 Aug. 15, v. 58 p.9-16dElsevier B.V.x0956-56637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2014.02.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02901naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245017100173300001600344500001900360520120100379536013501580592002801715596001901743650002801762650001601790650001901806650002701825650001701852650000901869650001401878650002301892650002601915650000901941650001901950650000801969650001501977650001101992653002502003653002502028653001902053653003502072700002202107700001902129700002002148773013302168856008502301852000902386655001202395IND60730290120221121135157.0210306e20210528xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073029012DNAL7 a10.1080/21683565.2020.18472322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPramanik, Prabhat10aCombined application of mica waste and Bacillus pseudomycoides as a potassium solubilizing bio-fertilizer reduced the dose of potassium fertilizer in tea-growing soil  ap. 732-744.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPotassium-solubilizing bacteria (KSB) are often used in the field of vegetable and horticultural crops. In this study, a strain of Bacillus pseudomycoides was used as the KSB strain and different combinations of muriate of potash (MoP) and mica waste (MW) along with that strain were applied in soil to evaluate its effect on exchangeable K content in soil and yield of tea shoots. The objective of this experiment was to evaluate the possibility of applying an indigenous KSB strain and MW combination for reducing doses of MoP during cultivation of perennial crops like tea. The study over two consecutive years revealed that cumulative tea production of some of the applied treatments was significantly higher than that of recommended MoP treatment. Application of KSB and MW in the first split instead of MoP recorded higher exchangeable K content in soil during August to October, especially in the second year of the study. The study confirmed B. pseudomycoides can be used as a KSB biofertilizer in soil and application of MW and KSB combined replacing MoP in the first split could be economical as well as improving K use-efficiency in soil and increased yield and K-uptake by the plants.  aThe work was financially supported by the funding of National Tea Research Foundation (NTRF), Tea Board of India (NTRF: 183/2016).  aPublisher supplied data  aNTRF: 183/2016 3aBacillus pseudomycoides 3aagroecology 3abiofertilizers 3aexchangeable potassium 3ahorticulture 3amica 3apotassium 3apotassium chloride 3apotassium fertilizers 3asoil 3asolubilization 3atea 3avegetables 3awastes 0aK supplement in soil 0aK-containing mineral 0aindigenous KSB 0aintegrated nutrient management1 aKalita, Chayanika1 aBorah, Krishna1 aKalita, Pallabi0 tAgroecology and sustainable food systems.g2021 May 28, v. 45, no. 5 p.732-744dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12333x2168-35737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/21683565.2020.18472323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02126naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002400152245008100176300001600257520093900273592002801212650002301240650001101263650001401274650001001288651001101298653001501309653004301324653002301367653002301390653001001413653001101423653001001434653001001444700002301454700002201477700002101499773010001520856008701620852000901707655001201716IND60610907820221121162559.0190402e20170401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061090782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2016.10.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLopez Pinar, Angela10aUnexpected impact of 2-methylisoborneol as off-odour substance in aged wines  ap. 498-504.  aFour Pinot noir wines from Burgundy were investigated by gas chromatography-olfactometry, with regard to the presence of earthy-smelling compounds. 2-Methylisoborneol (2-MIB) was detected in two of these wines, although the samples were seven years old, contradicting previous reports that this substance is unstable in wine and must. In order to investigate this seemingly paradoxical situation, 2-MIB stability was reinvestigated in wine and in model solution starting with an elevated initial concentration. Although 2-MIB concentration greatly decreased during the 90days of storage, the final concentration measured in both media was well above the odour threshold of the substance. Based on the observation of a decelerating decrease of 2-MIB with time, it was concluded that this substance can still be detected in wine and can induce, in this case, an earthy off-odour on condition that the start concentration is high enough.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2-methylisoborneol 3amodels 3aoff odors 3awines 3aFrance 0aOff-odours 0aGas chromatography-olfactometry (GC-O) 0a2-Methyl-2-bornene 0a2-Methylenebornane 0aMusty 0aMouldy 0aSmell 0aAroma1 aGhadiriasli, Rahil1 aDarriet, Philippe1 aBuettner, Andrea0 tFood chemistry.g2017 Apr. 01, v. 220 p.498-504dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2016.10.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03818naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001500143245018200158300001800340520230300358592002802661650004802689650002102737650001202758650001902770650002302789650001602812650003802828650000902866650001102875650000902886653002202895653002302917653001802940653001202958653001502970700001802985700001503003700001603018700001503034700001403049700001803063700001503081773015303096856007803249852000903327655001203336IND60539584420221119205421.0190318e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053958442DNAL7 a10.3168/jds.2014-82112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMore, S.J.10aEvaluation of testing strategies to identify infected animals at a single round of testing within dairy herds known to be infected with Mycobacterium avium ssp. paratuberculosis  ap. 5194-5210.  aAs part of a broader control strategy within herds known to be infected with Mycobacterium avium ssp. paratuberculosis (MAP), individual animal testing is generally conducted to identify infected animals for action, usually culling. Opportunities are now available to quantitatively compare different testing strategies (combinations of tests) in known infected herds. This study evaluates the effectiveness, cost, and cost-effectiveness of different testing strategies to identify infected animals at a single round of testing within dairy herds known to be MAP infected. A model was developed, taking account of both within-herd infection dynamics and test performance, to simulate the use of different tests at a single round of testing in a known infected herd. Model inputs included the number of animals at different stages of infection, the sensitivity and specificity of each test, and the costs of testing and culling. Testing strategies included either milk or serum ELISA alone or with fecal culture in series. Model outputs included effectiveness (detection fraction, the proportion of truly infected animals in the herd that are successfully detected by the testing strategy), cost, and cost-effectiveness (testing cost per true positive detected, total cost per true positive detected). Several assumptions were made: MAP was introduced with a single animal and no management interventions were implemented to limit within-herd transmission of MAP before this test. In medium herds, between 7 and 26% of infected animals are detected at a single round of testing, the former using the milk ELISA and fecal culture in series 5 yr after MAP introduction and the latter using fecal culture alone 15 yr after MAP introduction. The combined costs of testing and culling at a single round of testing increases with time since introduction of MAP infection, with culling costs being much greater than testing costs. The cost-effectiveness of testing varied by testing strategy. It was also greater at 5 yr, compared with 10 or 15 yr, since MAP introduction, highlighting the importance of early detection. Future work is needed to evaluate these testing strategies in subsequent rounds of testing as well as accounting for different herd dynamics and different levels of herd biocontainment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis 3aanimal husbandry 3aanimals 3abiocontainment 3acost effectiveness 3adairy herds 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3amilk 3amodels 3awhey 0aJohne’s disease 0atesting strategies 0ainfected herd 0acontrol 0aevaluation1 aCameron, A.R.1 aStrain, S.1 aCashman, W.1 aEzanno, P.1 aKenny, K.1 aFourichon, C.1 aGraham, D.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2015 Aug., v. 98, no. 8 p.5194-5210dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2014-82113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01329naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245009300167300001000260520045800270592002800728650002500756650002400781650001000805650001400815651000900829773012200838856008200960852000901042655001201051IND60630859920221121223553.0191230e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063085992DNAL7 a10.1007/s13314-019-0334-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLahuf, Adnan A.10aAlternaria alternata causes leaf blight of rosy periwinkle (Catharanthus roseus) in Iraq  ap. 4.  aNursery-grown rosy periwinkles (Catharanthus roseus) in Kerbala province, Iraq, showed severe symptoms of leaf blight.

This is true particularly for endotherms that are exclusively diurnal. We investigated the Grey Falcon (Falco hypoleucos), a predatory Australian endemic restricted to the hot arid/semi-arid zone. To understand how this species' entire population persists exclusively and permanently in this extreme environment we examined its activity levels and compared these with equivalent variables from the Peregrine Falcon (F. peregrinus), a cosmopolitan species that inhabits similar environments without being restricted to them. Further, we compared, across a selected group of Falco species, specific plumage characteristics (measured on museum specimens) that we anticipated would enhance the Grey Falcons' ability to cope with high heat loads. We found no morphological or physiological characteristics that would allow them to cope with heat better than other birds, but the chicks seem to have unusually high thermal tolerances. Grey Falcons do, however, possess a suite of unusual behavioural adaptations that, as we propose, enable them to cope with climatic extremes in arid environments. Specifically, throughout their lives Grey Falcons keep activity levels and thus physical exertion low. This behaviour contrasts strikingly with that of the Peregrine Falcon, which also actively hunts birds in flight. Keeping activity levels low is expected to minimize endogenous heat production and thus ease the Grey Falcon's thermoregulation during periods of high heat load. These birds may rely on low levels of relative humidity for efficient evaporative cooling, and this may explain their absolute restriction to hot arid/semi-arid zones.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFalco peregrinus 3acooling 3aendothermy 3afalcons 3afever 3aflight 3aheat production 3amuseums 3aplumage 3arelative humidity 0aArid environment 0aBehavioural adaptation 0aFalco hypoleucos 0aHyperthermia 0aMorphological adaptation1 aPavey, Chris R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2162-80191 aWalter, Gimme H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1025-71010 tJournal of thermal biology.g2022 Jan., v. 103 p.103108-dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:12493x0306-45657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.1031083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02995naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003300147245012000180300001200300520172500312592002802037650001002065650001602075650002702091650001402118650002302132650001902155650002402174650002302198650001702221650001502238700002102253700002002274700002302294700002002317700002102337700002402358773011302382856008102495852000902576655001202585IND60519312920221119105317.0160614e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051931292DNAL7 a10.1007/s12665-016-5388-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThomachot-Schneider, Céline10aRelationship between Na2SO4 concentration and thermal response of reconstituted stone in the laboratory and on site  ap. 762.  aThe reconstituted stone used in the Orval Abbey is highly susceptible to salt weathering. It was produced from debris of natural stones (which were at that time in short supply) by craftsmen working in the Abbey and its composition is highly variable. The major salt involved in weathering is sodium sulfate (Na₂SO₄). This study focused on the thermal behavior of a reconstituted stone with various degrees of weathering observed on-site and it was studied by passive and active infrared thermography (IRT), and on the evolution of reconstituted-stone samples in a salt uptake experiment in the laboratory. On-site, the thermal responses of salt-weathered and unweathered zones were different. IRT allowed to detect unweathered though highly salt-laden zones, although correlations between thermal response and salt concentration are difficult to establish due to the influence of surface properties (color and roughness). In the laboratory, samples of the reconstituted stone were submitted to successive immersion-drying cycles in solutions of Na₂SO₄ with 7, 14 and 26 % concentration and characterized by weighing, surface colorimetry and active IRT. Results showed that the thermal response (increase in surface temperature due to flash excitation: T ₘₐₓ) increased with salt concentration and with the number of cycles, as long as sample disintegration had not started. Then, it decreased and stabilized, whatever the salt concentration. Those results indicated that an increase in the thermal response of building materials (in active IRT) can be interpreted as an indicator of salt accumulation, possibly leading to damage. IRT proved to be an interesting non-destructive technique in this respect.  aPublisher supplied data 3acolor 3acolorimetry 3aconstruction materials 3aroughness 3asalt concentration 3asodium sulfate 3asurface temperature 3athermal properties 3athermography 3aweathering1 aGommeaux, Maxime1 aLelarge, Norman1 aConreux, Alexandra1 aMouhoubi, Kamel1 aBodnar, Jean-Luc1 aVázquez, Patricia,0 tEnvironmental earth sciences.g2016 May, v. 75, no. 9 p.762-762dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1866-62807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-016-5388-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04293naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001600143245014200159300001800301520280700319592002803126650002703154650002003181650002003201650002503221650001003246650001003256650001303266650001403279650001303293650002103306650001903327650000903346650002003355650001803375651001203393653002203405653002003427653001303447653002703460700002103487700001503508700001903523700001703542773015303559856007803712852000903790655001203799IND60539584520221119205356.0190318e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053958452DNAL7 a10.3168/jds.2014-87652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoche, S.M.10aEvaluating the effect of Focus Farms on Ontario dairy producers’ knowledge, attitudes, and behavior toward control of Johne’s disease  ap. 5222-5240.  aThis study evaluated a participatory-based, experiential learning program, Ontario Focus Farms (FF), which aimed to change dairy producer behavior to control Johne’s disease (JD) in Ontario, Canada. The goals were to (1) assess the effect of FF on participating dairy producers’ knowledge, attitudes, and behavior with regard to JD control; (2) compare changes in these factors among FF participants to changes among a group of nonparticipating dairy producers; and (3) describe the characteristics of producers who made at least one on-farm management change. Pre- and post-FF intervention questionnaires collected data on respondents’ knowledge, attitudes, behavior, herd production, and demographic information; before and after JD-risk assessments were used to assess respondents’ on-farm risk of JD transmission. Overall, 176 dairy producers participated in the FF process; 39.8% (70/176) of FF and 14.6% (52/357) of control participants responded to both the pre- and postintervention questionnaires. Upon comparison, FF respondents were more likely to be younger, have larger herds, and have higher management scores. The proportion of FF participants who reported making at least one on-farm change (81%) was significantly higher than that of control respondents (38%). Overall, FF respondents significantly changed their risk score in 4 out of 5 risk areas and had an average reduction of 13 points in their overall risk score between before and after risk assessments. Control respondents’ risk assessment scores did not significantly change during the study period. In a JD knowledge assessment, FF and control respondents exhibited a moderate knowledge score before the intervention period, with median scores of 75.9% (22/29) in each group. The FF respondents significantly increased their score at the postintervention assessment, with a median of 82.8% (24/29); control-respondent scores did not significantly change. Both FF and control respondents held strong positive attitudes toward JD control and felt a moderate amount of social pressure from veterinarians and industry organizations to make on-farm changes. However, they questioned their ability to effectively control JD on the farm. Last, participating in FF, having a moderate herd management score, having a positive perception about the practicality of on-farm recommendations, and having a singular learning preference were associated with increased odds of making an on-farm change. Overall, the FF process appears to be effective at influencing producer behavior toward implementing on-farm management practices for JD control. Future JD control programs should consider implementing peer-learning extension processes, such as FF, in combination with other extension approaches, to influence producer behavior.  aPublisher supplied data 3aattitudes and opinions 3adata collection 3adisease control 3adisease transmission 3afarms 3aherds 3aindustry 3aknowledge 3alearning 3aparatuberculosis 3aquestionnaires 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3aveterinarians 3aOntario 0aJohne’s disease 0abehavior change 0aattitude 0aagricultural extension1 aJones-Bitton, A.1 aMeehan, M.1 aVon Massow, M.1 aKelton, D.F.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2015 Aug., v. 98, no. 8 p.5222-5240dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2014-87653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02685naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001500155245014200170520152100312592002801833650002301861650002201884650001701906650001301923650001301936650000701949653000801956653001301964653002301977653001702000653001902017700001802036700001902054700001602073700001902089773009202108856009002200852000902290655001202299IND60778704420221116211548.0220628e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077870442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.1350772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYing, Hong14aThe impacts of aging pH and time of acid mine drainage solutions on Fe mineralogy and chemical fractions of heavy metals in the sediments  aFe (oxyhydr)oxides are the main components that accumulate heavy metals (HMs) in the acid mine drainage (AMD) sediments, but how the aging pH and time of AMD solution affects the Fe mineralogy and HMs speciation remains ambiguous. Herein, we determined the impacts of aging pH and time on the Fe mineralogy and chemical fractions of HMs in the sediments from Dabaoshan mining area using mineral characterizations, chemical extraction, and AMD solution incubation. For the natural AMD sediments, jarosite and goethite are the major Fe (oxyhydr)oxides in sample S1 with solution pH 2.68, while schwertmannite is dominant in sample S2 with solution pH 6.78, co-existing minor ferrihydrite. With increasing the AMD solution pH, the total contents of HMs (expect for As) and the reducible fraction of HMs (expect for Pb) in the sediments both increase. The HMs of Mn, Zn, Ni, and Cd are mainly associated with Fe (oxyhydr)oxides, while Pb possibly exists as Pb-bearing minerals (e.g., PbSO₄) in the sediments. The oxidizable fraction of all HMs is negligible in both sediments. When the AMD solution of S1 was aged at different pHs, schwertmannite is dominant initially at all pHs, with a higher crystallinity being at a lower pH. With increasing aging time, the pre-formed schwertmannite transforms to goethite and jarosite at pH ≤ 3, while it keeps stable at pH 5 and 7 due to the accumulation of more HMs. These new insights are essential to assess the mobility and availability of HMs in the AMD-affected areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacid mine drainage 3acrystal structure 3aferrihydrite 3agoethite 3ajarosite 3apH 0aAMD 0aSediment 0aFe (oxyhydr)oxides 0aHeavy metals 0aSchwertmannite1 aZhao, Wantong1 aFeng, Xionghan1 aGu, Chunhao1 aWang, Xiaoming0 tChemosphere.g2022 Sept., v. 303 p.135077-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.1350773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02551naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245006200169300001600231500001900247520128800266592002801554650001601582650003101598650001701629650000901646650001701655650001201672650002701684651001101711653001601722653002801738653002201766653003501788653002001823700002001843700002201863700001701885773013301902856008502035852000902120655001202129IND60730290220221121165636.0210306e20210528xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073029022DNAL7 a10.1080/21683565.2020.18661432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMann, Carolyn10aFarmers’ perspectives on soil health in Maritime Canada  ap. 673-688.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAlthough farmers are the key actors in managing soil health, we have little understanding of what farmers know about soil health, how they define the term, and how they manage for it on their farms. Interviews with 34 farmers in Maritime Canada revealed their perceptions about soil health, their methods for assessing their own soils, and their reactions to a comprehensive soil health assessment based on the Cornell Soil Health Assessment (CSHA). Farmers primarily assessed soils using aboveground indicators such as plant health and yield, as well as physical indicators such as texture or water-holding capacity. Most farmers (91%) had heard of soil health, and their definitions focused on biological and productivity aspects of the soil. Organic farmers tended to be more open to the CSHA results and were more likely to give a holistic definition of soil health than conventional farmers. Depending on what frame is invoked about soil, farmers think of soil health differently. Despite differences between farmers’ perceptions and CSHA results, most farmers found CSHA results useful (71%) and planned to undertake management changes (74%) based on them. Soil health could be an ‘inclusive’ common ground for farmers and soil scientists to think about and manage soils.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagroecology 3ahealth effects assessments 3aplant health 3asoil 3asoil quality 3atexture 3awater holding capacity 3aCanada 0aSoil health 0asoil health perceptions 0afarmer interviews 0aCornell Soil Health Assessment 0aMaritime Canada1 aLynch, Derek H.1 aDukeshire, Steven1 aMills, Aaron0 tAgroecology and sustainable food systems.g2021 May 28, v. 45, no. 5 p.673-688dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12333x2168-35737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/21683565.2020.18661433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02365naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001600164245014100180300001600321520078400337592002801121650002301149650002701172650002201199650001001221650002001231650001201251650001301263650003701276650002001313650001301333650002401346650001201370650001801382650003301400650002801433650004901461650002701510650005201537700001401589700001401603700001801617700001901635700001801654773009701672856008101769852000901850655001201859IND4398538520221119074755.0151024e200801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439853852DNAL7 a178991952pmid7 a10.1007/s00436-007-0751-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBalczun, C.10aSequence characterization of an unusual lysozyme gene expressed in the intestinal tract of the reduviid bug Triatoma infestans (Insecta)  ap. 229-232.  aAntibacterial proteins like lysozyme are important components of the insect non-specific immune response against bacteria. The complementary deoxyribonucleic acid (cDNA) encoding a new lysozyme from Triatoma infestans, named lysozyme2, has been amplified by polymerase chain reaction and the rapid amplification of cDNA ends technique. The gene is expressed in the small intestine of the insect. The deduced protein sequence shows up to 70% similarity to lysozymes from other species. Furthermore, the protein exhibits significant structural concordance to other insect lysozymes. A striking feature of the lysozyme2 protein is the replacement of the conserved amino acid residues of the active site of classical c-type lysozymes, glutamate and aspartate, by valine and tyrosine.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTriatoma infestans 3aantibacterial proteins 3acomplementary DNA 3agenes 3aimmune response 3ainsects 3alysozyme 3arapid amplification of cDNA ends 3asmall intestine 3atyrosine 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aGenes, Insect 2aIntestine, Smallxmetabolism 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMuramidasexchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aTriatomaxclassificationxgeneticsxmetabolism.1 aKnorr, E.1 aTopal, H.1 aMeiser, C.

In this study, the frequency of annual dust events in twenty-five stations and five climatic variables including rainfall, maximum annual wind speed, average annual wind speed, maximum annual temperature, and average annual temperature in arid regions of Iran up to 2014 were used to show the effects of climatic change on dust storms. Annual correlation coefficient time series between climatic variables and dust storms were first calculated based on monthly observations. Then, the trend in climatic variables, dust storm frequency, and their correlation were assessed using the Mann-Kendal method. Results indicated that the correlation coefficients had fluctuations in time and are both significant and insignificant in different years that reach from 0.6 to 0.9 for wind speed and temperature and -0.2 to -0.6 for precipitation. This trend in correlation has the same direction with climatic variables and shows co-movement between climatic change and dust storm fluctuations in central Iran. Results also showed that wind speed and temperature have a high impact on dust storm fluctuations and rainfall reduction has an increasing effect on dust storms.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aarid zones 3aclimate change 3adust 3adust storms 3arain 3atemperature 3atime series analysis 3awind speed 3aIran 0aclimatic change 0adust storm trend 0awind speed 0adrought 0airan1 amodarres, R.0 t̒Ulūm-i āb va khāk.g2022 Mar., v. 25, no. 4 p.239-252dIsfahan University of TechnologywJournal:27871x2476-55547nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02715naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100005800155245012600213300001600339520117100355592002801526650002501554650004401579650001401623650001201637650001301649650001901662650001801681650003101699650001201730650001101742650002201753650001301775650001901788653002501807653001701832653001501849653001301864653004401877700001701921700001701938700001801955700002201973700002001995700001902015773007702034856008902111852000902200655001202209IND60556736120221120103727.0161102e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055673612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2016.08.1192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, Namrata1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3987-553610aArsenic mediated modifications in Bacillus aryabhattai and their biotechnological applications for arsenic bioremediation  ap. 524-534.  aThe present study reports the arsenic (As) tolerance mechanism of bacteria Bacillus aryabhattai (NBRI014). The data explores the intracellular accumulation and volatilization of As from the culture medium after 48 h of exposure to 25,000 mg l−1 arsenate As(V). The study also provides the evidence of presence of ars operon in bacteria, which may have played an important role in reducing As toxicity. Additionally, we found 7 differentially expressed proteins to be up-regulated in bacterial cells upon As exposure which may have role in reducing As toxicity inside bacterial cells. Furthermore, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopic techniques were useful to describe the structural and compositional alterations in bacterial cells after As treatment. It showed the changes in peak positions of the spectrum pattern when NBRI014 was grown in medium containing As, indicating that these functional groups viz. (amino, alkyl halides and hydroxyl) present on bacterial surface, which may be involved in As binding. The above results signify that biotechnological application of the isolate NBRI014 could be helpful in removal of As from polluted sites.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus aryabhattai 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aarsenates 3aarsenic 3abacteria 3abioremediation 3aculture media 3agene expression regulation 3ahalides 3aoperon 3aprotein synthesis 3atoxicity 3avolatilization 0aBacillus aryabhattai 0aAs tolerance 0aars Operon 0aProteins 0aFourier-transform infrared spectroscopy1 aGupta, Sunil1 aMarwa, Naina1 aPandey, Vivek1 aVerma, Praveen C.1 aRathaur, Sushma1 aSingh, Nandita0 tChemosphere.g2016 Dec., v. 164 p.524-534dElsevier Ltdx0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2016.08.1193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03854naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001900154245009600173520229400269592002802563650001902591650001802610650001602628650001702644650002002661650002002681650002202701650002002723650002202743650001102765650002102776650001702797650001902814650001902833650002202852651001202874653002102886653002602907653002602933700002202959700002102981700002103002700002103023700002303044700002503067700002103092700001803113773009503131856008903226852000903315655001203324IND60674178620221116191607.0220614e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067417862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.landusepol.2019.03.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAjtai, Nicolae10aSupport tools for land use policies based on high resolution regional air quality modelling  aAir pollution is becoming a stringent issue, especially in large urban agglomerations like Bucharest, Romania. National and European air quality regulations are focusing on enforcing emission and immission limit values, but there is a poor correlation between air quality policies and land use policies, both critical to urban development. The objective of this study is to develop a methodological framework for including air quality data in policies concerning urban development and land use change. The novelty is given by the use of high-resolution regional air quality modelling data for key pollutants like PM₁₀, SO₂ and NO₂ with land use datasets. The study proposes a methodological framework based on the Urban Atlas Project’s land use classes and the WRF-Chem air quality model. Through overlay analysis of the air quality model output and land use datasets, it is possible to derive two major types of information: (1) the land use area and classes exposed to certain pollutant concentration intervals and (2) the variability of the exposed land use classes according to the air pollutants source – receptor dynamics. Results are presented in the form of applications of the methodological framework in two different case studies. The methodological framework could be used as a tool for practitioners to include and use the evidence from air pollution information in the spatial planning policies and practice. In the first case study, three PM₁₀ classes were set up in order to demonstrate the possibility to identify land use classes exposed to certain intervals of PM₁₀ concentrations and their extent. The second case study focuses on the land use classes and their extent exposed to SO₂ and NO₂ concentrations in two different meteorological scenarios during two days in September 2014. This approach could provide support for decision makers in the policy development process, resulting in more informed decisions regarding future destinations of different land categories taking into account air pollution data and indicators. This study also opens the way for future air quality satellite data (ESA Sentinel 5-P and 5), with resolutions similar to the air quality model outputs to be used in land use planning and policy development purposes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair pollutants 3aair pollution 3aair quality 3acase studies 3adata collection 3adecision making 3aissues and policy 3aland use change 3aland use planning 3amodels 3anitrogen dioxide 3aparticulates 3aremote sensing 3asulfur dioxide 3aurban development 3aRomania 0aLand use classes 0aAtmospheric pollution 0aAir quality modelling1 aStefanie, Horatiu1 aBotezan, Camelia1 aOzunu, Alexandru1 aRadovici, Andrei1 aDumitrache, Rodica1 aIriza-Burcă, Amalia1 aDiamandi, Andrei1 aHirtl, Marcus0 tLand use policy.g2020 June, v. 95 p.103909-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12412x0264-83777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2019.03.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01421naa a2200241 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001500112245007400127300001400201520063400215592002800849650001700877650001800894650001500912700001300927773014200940856007601082852000901158655001201167IND60529867020221119053806.0160720e20101201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052986702DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKopali, A.10aStudy on decantation ways of rock salt brines and their effective use  ap. 67-73.  aRock salt from Dhrovjani mine (Delvina) is characterized by a very high content of insoluble in water matter (around 20%).

Evidences from France, Italy and Spain  aThe spread of geographical indications (GIs) is quite heterogeneous within the European Union. Some areas show a large number of registered GI products, while others scarcely use this policy tool. In our study, we investigate the relation between several environmental and socio-economic factors and the degree of GI use at regional level in the three leading countries in terms of registered GI products: Italy, France and Spain. To do so, we implement an infrequency of purchase model that allows us to estimate two sets of parameters. In this way we can estimate the effect of each factor on two measures: the probability of observing a new GI registration in a region and the variation of the intensity of protection. Our findings show that marginality conditions, such as the presence of less favored areas or the remoteness of an area, the producers’ attitude to cooperate and the past tradition of registering GI products are the major determinants of the degree of protection sought through GI labels. This allows interesting conclusions to be drawn about the effectiveness of the GI policy in targeting less developed areas, as well as suggesting possible ways to further stimulate the use of GIs for protecting local products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3afood policy 3amodels 3aprobability 3aFrance 3aItaly 3aSpain 0aGeographical indications 0aInfrequency of purchase 0aPolicy adoption 0aRegional factors1 aStefani, Gianluca1 aDefrancesco, Edi0 tFood policy.g2021 Dec., v. 105 p.102170-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl9768x0306-91927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodpol.2021.1021703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02990naa a2200709 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001400152245012100166300001800287520105900305592002801364650002201392650002001414650001201434650001401446650001001460650001601470650000901486650001701495650001901512650002001531650002001551650001701571650002301588653003601611653002601647653001501673653002401688653001901712653000701731653000801738653000901746653000801755653001601763653000901779653000801788653000801796653000801804653000701812653001101819653001701830653000701847700001801854700001901872700001501891700001901906700001701925700001901942700001501961700001401976700001401990700001702004700001402021773013702035856008702172852000902259655001202268IND60676116620221122175033.0200210e20200201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067611662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2019.09.1772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Yue10aPolysaccharides from Lycium barbarum ameliorate amyloid pathology and cognitive functions in APP/PS1 transgenic mice  ap. 1004-1012.  aAlzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common degenerative disease of the central nervous system. It is associated with abnormal accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques, impaired neurogenesis, and damaged cognitive functions. We have known for a long time that natural compounds and their derivatives have gained increasing attention in AD drug research due to their multiple effects and inherently enormous chemicals. In this study, we will demonstrate that polysaccharides from L. barbarum (LBP1), a traditional natural compound, can reduce Aβ level and improve the cognitive functions in APP/PS1 transgenic mouse. LBP1 can enhance neurogenesis as indicated by BrdU/NeuN double labeling. Furthermore, it can restore synaptic dysfunction at hippocampus CA3-CA1 pathway. Additionally, in vitro cell assay indicates that LBP1 may affect Aβ processing. In conclusion, our study indicates that LBP1 might be a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of AD against multiple targets that include synaptic plasticity, Aβ pathology and neuropathology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlzheimer disease 3aLycium barbarum 3aamyloid 3acognition 3adrugs 3ahippocampus 3amice 3aneurogenesis 3aneuropathology 3aneuroplasticity 3apolysaccharides 3atherapeutics 3atransgenic animals 0aLycium barbarum polysaccharides 0aAlzheimer’s disease 0aAmyloid-β 0aSynaptic plasticity 0aNeuropathology 0aAD 0aAβ 0aLBP1 0aLTP 0aL. barbarum 0aBrdU 0aNOR 0aPBS 0aPFA 0aFA 0afEPSPs 0asection ACSF 0aWT1 aDuan, Yanhong1 aHuang, Shichao1 aZhou, Xuan1 aZhou, Lishuang1 aHu, Tingting1 aYang, Yongfeng1 aLü, Jing,1 aDing, Kan1 aGuo, Dean1 aCao, Xiaohua1 aPei, Gang0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2020 Feb. 01, v. 144 p.1004-1012dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2019.09.1773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03510naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245010300168300001000271520221100281592002802492650000802520650001302528650001702541650001002558650001102568650001402579650002502593650001502618650001302633650001002646650001302656650002002669650001702689650001402706650002202720650001202742650001702754700004102771700002202812700002102834773010602855856008202961852000903043655001203052IND60630860020221119205457.0221001e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063086002DNAL7 a10.1186/s13750-019-0146-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSordello, Romain10aEvidence of the environmental impact of noise pollution on biodiversity: a systematic map protocol  ap. 8.  aBACKGROUND: For decades, biodiversity has suffered massive losses worldwide. Urbanization is one of the major drivers of extinction because it leads to the physical fragmentation and loss of natural habitats and it is associated with related effects, e.g. pollution and in particular noise pollution given that many man-made sounds are generated in cities (e.g. industrial and traffic noise, etc.). However, all human activities generate sounds, even far from any human habitation (e.g. motor boats on lakes, aircraft in the air, etc.). Ecological research now deals increasingly with the effects of noise pollution on biodiversity. Many studies have shown the impacts of anthropogenic noise and concluded that it is potentially a threat to life on Earth. The present work describes a protocol to systematically map evidence of the environmental impact of noise pollution on biodiversity. The resulting map will inform on the species most studied and on the demonstrated impacts. This will be useful for further primary research by identifying knowledge gaps and in view of further analysis, such as systematic reviews. METHODS: Searches will include peer-reviewed and grey literature published in English and French. Two online databases will be searched using English terms and search consistency will be assessed with a test list. No geographical restrictions will be applied. The subject population will include all species. Exposures will include all types of man-made sounds (industrial, traffic, etc.) in all types of environments (or media) (terrestrial, aerial, aquatic), including all contexts and sound origins (spontaneous or recorded sounds, in situ or laboratory studies, etc.). All relevant outcomes will be considered (space use, reproduction, communication, abundance, etc.). An open-access database will be produced with all relevant studies selected during the three screening stages. For each study, the database will contain metadata on key variables of interest (species, types of sound, outcomes, etc.). This database will be available in conjunction with a map report describing the mapping process and the evidence base with summary figures and tables of the study characteristics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aaircraft 3abiodiversity 3aboats 3acities 3adatabases 3aenvironmental impact 3aextinction 3ahabitats 3alakes 3ametadata 3anoise pollution 3areproduction 3ascreening 3asystematic review 3atraffic 3aurbanization1 aFlamerie De Lachapelle, Frédérique1 aLivoreil, Barbara1 aVanpeene, Sylvie0 tEnvironmental evidence.g2019 Dec., v. 8, no. 1 p.8-8dBioMed CentralwJournal:21545x2047-23827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13750-019-0146-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03022naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245010600158300001800264520155900282592002801841650002101869650000901890650001901899650001301918650001801931650001301949650001601962650002201978650002202000650002802022650001902050653002302069653002102092653002602113653003002139653003302169700001902202700001702221700001702238700001602255700001902271700001302290700001702303773012402320856007502444852000902519655001202528IND60527447120221120133619.0160715e20130612xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052744712DNAL7 a10.1021/am40074032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Cuifeng10aTwo-Photon Induced Photoluminescence and Singlet Oxygen Generation from Aggregated Gold Nanoparticles  ap. 4972-4977.  aMetal nanoparticles have potential applications as bioimaging and photosensitizing agents. Aggregation effects are generally believed to be adverse to their biomedical applications. Here we have studied the aggregation effects on two-photon induced photoluminescence and singlet oxygen generation of Au nanospheres and Au nanorods of two different aspect ratios. Aggregated Au nanospheres and short Au nanorods were found to display enhanced two-photon induced photoluminescence and singlet oxygen generation capabilities compared to the unaggregated ones. The two-photon photoluminescence of Au nanospheres and short Au nanorods were enhanced by up to 15.0- and 2.0-fold upon aggregation, and the corresponding two-photon induced singlet oxygen generation capabilities were enhanced by 8.3 and 1.8-fold, respectively. The two-photon induced photoluminescence and singlet oxygen generation of the aggregated long Au nanorods were found to be lower than the unaggregated ones. These results support that the change in their two-photon induced photoluminescence and singlet oxygen generation originate from aggregation modulated two-photon excitation efficiency. This finding is expected to foster more biomedical applications of metal nanoparticles as Au nanoparticles normally exist in an aggregated form in the biological environments. Considering their excellent biocompatibility, high inertness, ready conjugation, and easy preparation, Au nanoparticles are expected to find more applications in two-photon imaging and two-photon photodynamic therapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiocompatibility 3agold 3aimage analysis 3ananogold 3ananoparticles 3ananorods 3ananospheres 3aphotochemotherapy 3aphotoluminescence 3aphotosensitizing agents 3asinglet oxygen 0agold nanoparticles 0aplasmon coupling 0atwo-photon excitation 0asinglet oxygen generation 0atwo-photon photoluminescence1 aZhao, Tingting1 aYuan, Peiyan1 aGao, Nengyue1 aPan, Yanlin1 aGuan, Zhenping1 aZhou, Na1 aXu, Qing-Hua0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2013 June 12, v. 5, no. 11 p.4972-4977dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fam40074033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02071naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002200145245007900167300001800246500001100264520093100275592002801206596009701234596005301331650001101384650001201395650002201407650001801429650001401447650001901461650001601480700002001496773011601516856008001632852000901712655001201721IND60786873620221120111338.0220806e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078687362DNAL7 a10.1002/1873-3468.134992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 adi Donato, Martin10aHSP90 and co‐chaperones: a multitaskers’ view on plant hormone biology  ap. 1415-1430.  aREVIEW  aIn order to survive under ever‐changing conditions plants must be able to adaptively respond to their environment. Plant hormones and the signaling cross‐talk among them play a key role in integrating external and internal cues, enabling the plants to acclimate accordingly. HSP90 and several of its co‐chaperones are known as pleiotropic factors involved in the signaling pathways of multiple stress responses, including temperature, drought, and pathogen infection. Recently, hormone receptor components for auxin and jasmonic acid, respectively, have been identified as clients of the HSP90 chaperone system, suggesting a direct HSP90‐dependent link to hormone signaling. In this review, we give an overview of the multiple roles of HSP90 and its co‐chaperones in plant hormone biology and discuss the largely unexplored targets for signal integration that the activity of these apparent multitaskers may suggest.  aPublisher supplied data  a31003A_165877cSchweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung  cEuropean Space Agency (CORA‐GBF project LIRAT) 3aauxins 3adrought 3ahormone receptors 3ajasmonic acid 3apathogens 3aplant hormones 3atemperature1 aGeisler, Markus0 tFEBS letters.g2019 July, v. 593, no. 13 p.1415-1430dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl16404x0014-57937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/1873-3468.134993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02206naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100007100147245012600218300001000344520102400354592002801378650000901406650002001415650001301435650002401448650002201472650001101494650001001505650001201515650002401527650001201551650001601563651001301579700002301592773012701615856008101742852000901823655001201832IND60630860120221119205954.0191230e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063086012DNAL7 a10.1186/s40100-019-0120-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTesfay, Gebremeskel Berhane1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1288-034310aShocks in food availability and intra-household resources allocation: evidence on children nutrition outcomes in Ethiopia  ap. 3.  aThis paper examines the intra-gender nutrition outcome both with and without the presence of household level shock using Living Standards Measurement Study-Integrated Survey (LSMS) panel data in Ethiopia. We used a mixed-effect estimation strategy to analyze how parents’ gender preference affects resource allocation between boys and girls, and nutrition outcomes. We used a gender dummy and found that child gender dummy interaction with household level shock index variables does not have a significant effect on child nutrition. The results indicate that nutrition equality could be due to (1) the girls’ biological bodily development that causes differences in trouble tolerance such that the girls’ nutrition remains the same as that of boys and (2) the boys’ physical exercises which cause weight loss such that it brings their nutrition down making it equal to that of the girls’. The results suggest the need for energy food supplementation for boys and a need for equal care for both girls and boys.  aPublisher supplied data 3aboys 3achild nutrition 3achildren 3aenergy requirements 3afood availability 3agender 3agirls 3aparents 3aresource allocation 3asurveys 3aweight loss 3aEthiopia1 aAbidoye, Babatunde0 tAgricultural and food economics.g2019 Dec., v. 7, no. 1 p.3-3dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:21601x2193-75327nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40100-019-0120-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01752naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002000112245008300132300001400215520069400229592002800923650002600951650001500977650002100992650001201013650001301025650001501038650001301053650001501066650001101081650001401092651001201106700001801118700001601136773014301152856008601295852000901381655001201390IND60529867220221119054152.0160720e20120301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052986722DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKromidha, Genti10aIdentification of best management alternatives for shrub formations in Albania  ap. 35-42.  aMediterranean scrublands occur naturally in the Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub biomes, located in the five Mediterranean climate regions of the world.

To address these limitations, a high sensitive aptasensor for sulfadimethoxine (SDM) using unmodified gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) was developed in the present study. The assay sensitivity was improved by optimizing several key parameters such as the amount of aptamer adsorbed to AuNPs, the concentration of salt and the AuNPs pH value. To our knowledge, this is the first time to investigate the effect of AuNPs pH value on the sensitivity of aptamer–AuNPs based label-free assay. The best procedure for SDM analysis in our system was: the pH value at 8.0, and the concentration of aptamer at 2μM, and the concentration of salt at 2M. The linear range for the current analytical system was from 50ng/mL to 1μg/mL, and the detection limit was 50ng/mL, which is lower than the Maximum Residue Limit (MRL) (100ng/mL) in edible animal tissues regulated by China and European commission. Our study provides a simple, fast, and easy to read method for SDM analysis with high sensitivity, which can be applied in future on-site detection in animal products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal products 3aanimal tissues 3aantibiotic residues 3abiosensors 3adetection limit 3ainstrumentation 3amaximum residue limits 3ananogold 3aoligonucleotides 3apH 3asalt concentration 3asulfadimethoxine 3aChina 0aAptamer 0aBiosensor 0aGold nanoparticles 0aSulfadimethoxine 0aLabel-free1 aJiang, Xiaoling1 aZhang, Weiwei1 aChen, Gang1 aZhao, Yan1 aTunio, Tarique Muhammad1 aLiu, Dongxing,1 aLv, Zhenzhen1 aLi, Cheng1 aYang, Shuming0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2013 Apr. 15, v. 42 p.419-425dElsevier B.V.x0956-56637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2012.10.0593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03162naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245013100173300001400304500001900318520163400337592002801971650001101999650001402010650002502024650001702049650001002066650001502076650001102091650001402102650001202116650001602128650002002144650002102164650002202185650001602207650002302223651001002246653002602256653002702282653002502309653003302334653000902367700002002376700002302396773014302419856008502562852000902647655001202656IND60730290520221121135126.0210306e20210102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073029052DNAL7 a10.1080/22311866.2020.18710712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYende, Subhash R.10aAntioxidant and Cognitive Enhancing Activities of Sargassum ilicifolium and Padina tetrastromatica in Scopolamine Treated Mice  ap. 11-21.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSargassum ilicifolium (Turner) C. Agardh (SI) and Padina tetrastromatica (Hauck) (PT) are tropical and sub-tropical brown algae, found in the coastal region of India. In the present study, the cognitive enhancing activity of chloroform and ethanol extract of SI and PT (CSI, ESI & CPT, EPT) was investigated in scopolamine- induced amnesic mice using the Passive avoidance (PA) test. In addition, the effect on brain oxidative enzymes and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) was also evaluated using a spectrophotometer. The results of this study indicated that CSI (600 mg/kg), ESI (600 mg/kg), as well as CPT (600 mg/kg), significantly increased Step-Down Latency compared to scopolamine treated group, indicated that, CSI, ESI and CPT significantly (p < 0.01) reversed memory deficit produced by scopolamine. Further, administration of CSI (600 mg/kg), ESI (600 mg/kg), as well as CPT (600 mg/kg), produced a significant (p < 0.01) fall in Malondialdehyde and increased in Reduced glutathione activity, indicated that CSI, ESI, and CPT exert a protective effect against oxidative damage induced by scopolamine. Also, it was found that, CSI (600 mg/kg), ESI (600 mg/kg) and CPT (600 mg/kg) significantly (p < 0.05) inhibit AChE activity. These findings resemble the effect of the standard anti-amnesic drug Piracetam. In conclusion, chloroform and ethanol extract of SI and PT shows significant cognitive-enhancing activities by the inhibition enzyme AChE and by the regulation of the oxidative enzymes in scopolamine-induced amnesic mice. However, further research is essential to explore the exact mechanism underlying this activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPadina 3aSargassum 3aacetylcholinesterase 3aantioxidants 3abrain 3achloroform 3acoasts 3acognition 3aethanol 3aglutathione 3amalondialdehyde 3amemory disorders 3aprotective effect 3ascopolamine 3aspectrophotometers 3aIndia 0aSargassum ilicifolium 0aPadina tetrastromatica 0aantioxidant activity 0acognitive enhancing activity 0aAChE1 aArora, Sumit K.1 aIttadwar, Abhay M.0 tJournal of Biologically Active Products from Nature.g2021 Jan. 02, v. 11, no. 1 p.11-21dTaylor & FranciswJournal:19680x2231-18747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/22311866.2020.18710713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01524naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001700146245014600163300001600309520042600325592002800751650002200779650001200801650001100813650001900824653002500843653002200868653002200890653001900912653003000931700001700961773011900978856008001097852000901177655001201186IND60616755020221122233017.0181020e200803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061675502DNAL7 a10.1177/00405175070823522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKurbak, Arif10aBasic Studies for Modeling Complex Weft Knitted Fabric Structures Part I: A Geometrical Model for Widthwise Curlings of Plain Knitted Fabrics  ap. 198-208.  aA geometrical model for widthwise curlings in plain knitted structures is suggested here based on the plain knitted fabric model of Kurbak (1998).

RESULTS: Fur box (binding site for Fur) was substituted for the lac operator to regulate the expression of GFP with the lac promoter. Since the addition of supersaturated silicic acid invokes iron deficiency, supersaturated silicic acids were used as an inducer. GFP expression was dependent on silica concentration, and the expression level without silica was negligible. Basal expression level of this lac-Fur system was extremely low and, hence, lytic enzyme gene E from bacteriophage ϕX174 could be retained in this system. Furthermore, the expression of genes of interest was spontaneously initiated as the cell density increased and the costs of the inducer are considerably less than IPTG. CONCLUSION: The combination of lac promoter and Ferric uptake repressor allowed the protein expression by supersaturated silicic acid as an inducer in an easy and cost-effective way.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3abacteriophages 3abinding sites 3acost effectiveness 3agene expression 3agenes 3airon 3anutrient deficiencies 3aprotein synthesis 3asilica 3asilicic acid1 aTanoue, Ryo1 aYokoyama, Takushi1 aDoi, Katsumi0 tBiotechnology letters.g2016 Aug., v. 38, no. 8 p.1381-1387dSpringer Netherlandsx0141-54927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10529-016-2118-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02439naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002600154245012000180506011700300506007600417520096900493592002801462506003701490650002601527650001901553650001201572650001001584650002401594650001901618650001301637651001401650653001901664653001901683653001601702653001201718653001401730700006201744700001801806773009501824856008901919852000902008655001202017IND60674179020221207073305.0220614e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067417902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.landusepol.2019.1041892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaptutyningsih, Endah10aDoes social capital matter in climate change adaptation?

Mitigation of a threat that results from climate change requires adaptation strategies. This study investigates farmers’ willingness to participate in the process of climate change adaptation in Yogyakarta, Indonesia; particularly in facing the increasing risk of pest attacks. Using a logistic regression model, we tested the impacts of social capital on farmers’ willingness to participate. The results showed that 70% of farmers were willing to contribute financially to the adaptation process. This participation was positively correlated with high social capital, which consists of high level of trust, community engagement, and personal relations with people in other villages. This study contributes to the literature by highlighting the potential roles of social capital in the process of climate change adaptation in agricultural sector.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aagricultural industry 3aclimate change 3afarmers 3apests 3aregression analysis 3asocial capital 3avillages 3aIndonesia 0aClimate change 0aSocial capital 0aAgriculture 0aFarmers 0aIndonesia1 aDiswandi, Diswandi1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7114-937X1 aJaung, Wanggi0 tLand use policy.g2020 June, v. 95 p.104189-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12412x0264-83777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2019.1041893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03087naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001400143245015300157300001800310520153000328592002801858650002901886650001601915650001501931650001601946650001901962650001301981650000901994650001202003650003102015650000902046650002302055650001702078651001302095653002302108653002902131653002502160653001502185700001602200700001602216700001502232700001502247700001802262700001602280700001702296700001602313773015302329856007802482852000902560655001202569IND60539584920221119205329.0190318e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053958492DNAL7 a10.3168/jds.2014-91992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReyes, J.10aEvaluation of the efficacy of intramuscular versus intramammary treatment of subclinical Streptococcus agalactiae mastitis in dairy cows in Colombia  ap. 5294-5303.  aA randomized controlled trial was performed in 17 Colombian dairy herds to determine the cure risk among cows subclinically infected with Streptococcus agalactiae exposed to 2 antibiotic therapies. Composite milk samples were collected before milking at the onset of the trial (pretreatment) and 2 subsequent times over a period of approximately 63 d. The intramammary application (IMM) of ampicillin-cloxacillin was compared with the intramuscular application (IM) of penethamate hydriodide, and cure risks after an initial and retreatment application were assessed. Cure risk after the initial treatment was higher (82.4%) for the IMM treatment than for IM therapy (65.8%). However, no difference was observed in the cure risk of refractory cases after retreatment (IMM=52.6% vs. IM=51.2%). The cumulative cure risk (both initial and retreatment) was 90.4 and 82.9% for the IMM and IM products, respectively. A 2-level random effects logistic model that controlled for pretreatment cow-level somatic cell count, indicated that IM treatment (odds ratio=0.37) had a lower cure risk than IMM and a tendency for a lower cure risk with increasing baseline somatic cell count. Our findings suggest that both products and administration routes can reduce the prevalence of S. agalactiae in affected herds, but the IMM product had a better efficacy in curing the infection. In addition to the treatment protocol, the cow somatic cell count should be considered when making management decisions for cows infected with S. agalactiae.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStreptococcus agalactiae 3aantibiotics 3adairy cows 3adairy herds 3alogit analysis 3amastitis 3amilk 3amilking 3arandomized clinical trials 3arisk 3asomatic cell count 3atherapeutics 3aColombia 0asomatic cell count 0aStreptococcus agalactiae 0asubclinical mastitis 0aantibiotic1 aChaffer, M.1 aSanchez, J.1 aTorres, G.1 aMacias, D.1 aJaramillo, M.1 aDuque, P.C.1 aCeballos, A.1 aKeefe, G.P.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2015 Aug., v. 98, no. 8 p.5294-5303dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2014-91993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02358naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002200112245005600134300001400190520125000204592002801454650001101482650001301493650001001506650000901516650001101525650001901536650001601555650000901571650000901580650001501589650001401604650001101618650001101629650001401640650001101654700001401665700001401679700001301693773014301706856007801849852000901927655001201936IND60529867420221119054135.0160720e20110401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052986742DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLika (Cekani), M.10aBacterial load in the human upper respiratory tract  ap. 39-44.  aMost of the surfaces of the upper respiratory tract (including nasal and oral passages, nasopharynx, oropharynx, and trachea) are colonized by normal flora. These organisms are usually regular inhabitants of these surfaces and rarely cause disease. Once a respiratory tract pathogen is in the respiratory tract it colonizes the surfaces causing creating so the conditions to cause a disease. Certain microorganisms considered as etiological agent of disease can cause the disease if they are present in a sufficient number on the respiratory tract and they possess virulent factors that are expressed in any host. The most common bacteria in chronic upper respiratory tract, head and neck infections are anaerobic ones. The distribution of the organism according to the seasons has resulted to have a significant connection. From 700 cases, 502 were negative and 198 cases presented bacterial load. The number of cases resulted to be 41 in spring season, 91 in Summer, 36 in the Autumn and 30 in the Winter season. Most microorganisms predominate in summer rather than S.pneumococcus which dominates in the autumn. Source sampling have not resulted organism independent. We noticed that three different sources of different bacteria predominate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautumn 3abacteria 3aflora 3ahead 3ahumans 3amicrobial load 3anasopharynx 3aneck 3anose 3aoropharynx 3apathogens 3aspring 3asummer 3avirulence 3awinter1 aKulla, A.1 aNelaj, E.1 aMece, O.0 tAlbanian journal of agricultural sciences.g2011 Apr. 1, v. 10, no. 1 p.39-44dAgricultural University of Tirana, Albaniax2218-20207nnas40uhttps://sites.google.com/a/ubt.edu.al/rssb/revista2011first/lika_etal.pdf  aDNAL 7aarticle01154naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245008600168300001400254520028400268592002800552650001200580650001500592650002100607650001900628700002100647773011700668856008200785852000900867655001200876IND60654993220221118040433.0190728e194012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065499322DNAL7 a10.1177/0040517540011002022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFox, Kenneth R.10aSimplified Method. for the Deter mination of Refractive Indices of Textile Fibres  ap. 62-71.  aA new method of determining the refractive indices of fibres is described which uses as its basis, a photometric match of Becke line intensities emanating from the difference between the maximum and the minimum refractive indices of the fibre and the index of the mounting fluid.  aPublisher supplied data 3afabrics 3aphotometry 3arefractive index 3atextile fibers1 aFinch, Rogers B.0 tTextile research journal.g1940 Dec., v. 11, no. 2 p.62-71dSage PublicationswJournal:jnl46536x0040-51757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0040517540011002023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02483naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002000145245009100165300001800256500002000274520091900294592002801213596009601241596008301337596009501420596007101515596006601586650002301652650001701675650001001692650001301702650002201715650002101737650001301758650001901771700002101790700005701811773011601868856008001984852000902064655001202073IND60786873920221120111236.0220806e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078687392DNAL7 a10.1002/1873-3468.134422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aColombo, Matteo10aTopology and enzymatic properties of a canonical Polycomb repressive complex 1 isoform  ap. 1837-1848.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aPolycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) catalyses monoubiquitination of histone H2A on Lys119, promoting gene silencing. Cells at different developmental stages and in different tissues express different PRC1 isoforms. The topology, subunit composition, structural architecture and molecular mechanism of most of these isoforms are still poorly characterized. Here, we have purified a PRC1 isoform comprising subunits RING1B, PCGF2, CBX2 and PHC2, two stable subcomplexes (RING1B‐PCGF2 and RING1B‐PHC2) and the catalytic subunit RING1B in isolation. By crosslinking mass spectrometry, we identified novel interactions between RING1B and the three non‐catalytic subunits. Biochemical, biophysical, and enzymatic data suggest that CBX2 and PHC2 play a structural role, whereas PCGF2 also modulates catalysis. Our data offer insights into the molecular architecture of PRC1 and its histone ubiquitination activity.  aPublisher supplied data  aANR‐10‐INSB‐05‐02cFrench Infrastructure for Integrated Structural Biology (FRISBI)  aECTZ18552cAgence Nationale de Recherche sur le Sida et les hépatites virales  aANR‐10‐LABX‐49‐01cGrenoble Alliance for Integrated Structural Cell Biology (GRAL)  a18CN047‐00cInstitut Thématique Multi‐Organisme Cancer (ITMO)  aANR‐15‐CE11‐0003‐01cAgence Nationale de la Recherche 3acatalytic activity 3acrosslinking 3agenes 3ahistones 3amass spectrometry 3aprotein subunits 3atopology 3aubiquitination1 aPessey, Ombeline1 aMarcia, Marco1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2430-07130 tFEBS letters.g2019 July, v. 593, no. 14 p.1837-1848dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl16404x0014-57937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/1873-3468.134423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02314naa a2200337 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100002200115245016100137300001600298520127000314592002801584650002101612650000901633650001501642650001901657650001301676650002701689650002201716650001301738650001701751650001101768651002001779773011001799852000901909939003301918946001301951655001201964991568382700742620221119185509.0181002e198709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aADL880160562DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSMETTEM, K.

Spatial variability of selected infiltration parameters was studied using geostatistics and frequency distribution statistics. The occurrence of transmission macropores, stained with methylene blue, was recorded and their influence on measured parameters assessed.Sorptivity measured at a small suction (-100 mm potential), which is not influenced by macropores >0.3 mm equivalent diameter, exhibited slight spatial dependence, whereas in situ steady-state ponded infiltration rates had no spatial dependence. Cylindrical transmission macropores with measured diameters greater than 2 mm strongly affected the magnitude and frequency distribution of “detached” Ksat values, but did not affect in situ ponded sorptivity, presumably because the surface area available for adsorption was not increased significantly by pores of this size. Excluding all pores greater than 0.3 mm equivalent diameter, however, reduced sorptivity by 40%.The results indicate that in modeling runoff processes there is a need to discriminate between macropore and matrix contributions to the variability of infiltration parameters in the field.  aPublisher supplied data 3asandy loam soils 3aclay 3amacropores 3amacropore flow 3asorption 3ahydraulic conductivity 3ahydrologic models 3adrainage 3asoil texture 3arunoff 3aSouth Australia0 tSoil science.g1987 Sept., v. 144, no. 3 p.167-174dWilliams & WilkinswJournal:jnl44572x0038-075X7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19880614c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02371naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001900155245015600174300001600330520107900346592002801425650002701453650002001480650001201500650001801512650000701530650002401537650001201561650000901573650002501582650002101607650001501628651001001643653001801653653001001671653002801681653002001709700001801729700001501747773007701762856008901839852000901928655001201937IND60556736520221120103826.0161102e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055673652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2016.08.1232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Zhiqiang10aRare earth element migration in gullies with different Dicranopteris dichotoma covers in the Huangnikeng gully group, Changting County, Southeast China  ap. 443-450.  aLittle is known about rare earth element (REE) migration in gullies in Southeast China. We examine the concentration and distribution of REE, soil variables, and correlations among REE and soil variables field investigation, laboratory measurement, and statistical analysis in the three gullies with different Dicranopteris dichotoma covers in the Huangnikeng gully group, Changting County, Southeast China. We show that the REE pattern in gullies is typical of red soil in Southeast China. REE migrate severely in gullies with low vegetation cover, REE migrate from higher sites to lower sites under the influence of water flow and gravity, and gullies can be considered an important REE source. Dicranopteris dichotoma can succeed in gullies and affect part of soil variables, organic C and pH can play an important role in REE migration in gullies, and Dicranopteris dichotoma is a recommended plant for effectively controlling REE migration and gully erosion. The critical vegetation cover of gullies should be further studied to control REE migration and gully erosion.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDicranopteris linearis 3aedaphic factors 3agravity 3agully erosion 3apH 3arare earth elements 3aravines 3asoil 3astatistical analysis 3avegetation cover 3awater flow 3aChina 0aREE migration 0aGully 0aDicranopteris dichotoma 0aSoutheast China1 aChen, Zhibiao1 aBai, Liyue0 tChemosphere.g2016 Dec., v. 164 p.443-450dElsevier Ltdx0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2016.08.1233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03978naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001300155245012400168520195100292592002802243650002502271650002202296650002402318650002502342650002302367650002902390650002902419650002402448650002202472650002802494650002002522650002002542650002902562650002702591650002002618650001702638650001002655650002202665650001202687650003702699650000702736650001402743650001902757650003002776650001802806650002202824650001302846650002202859650001602881653001602897653004102913653002902954700001802983700002203001700001703023700001403040700001803054700001503072700001903087773009903106856009003205852000903295655001203304IND60684950420221118164253.0200503e20200630xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068495042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2020.7351652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Xixi10aCharacterization of a Bacillus velezensis with antibacterial activity and inhibitory effect on common aquatic pathogens  aThe strain CPA1–1 with better antibacterial ability was isolated and screened from healthy Macrobrachium nipponense by spot inoculation for the first time. It was identified as Bacillus velezensis through morphological, physiological and biochemical characteristics in combination with 16S rRNA and gyrB sequence analysis. The characteristics of growth, antimicrobial spectrum, the carrying of antibiotic-related genes and safety analysis of the strain were also studied. The results showed that the optimal growth temperature of strain CPA1–1 was 25–37 °C, and the growth of the strain was slow under 20 °C. The optimum pH value was 5–9, and the strain was severely inhibited when the pH was lower than 3 or higher than 11. The strain CPA1–1 could grow at a salinity of 5–60‰, and the optimal salinity was 5–20‰. CPA1–1 has better antibacterial effects on indicator bacteria, Aeromonas veronii, Plesimonas shigelloides, Aeromonas hydrophila, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Citrobacter freundii, and the average diameter of the inhibition zones were 31.2 mm, 26.5 mm, 23.3 mm, 21.4 mm and 10.5 mm, respectively. Through PCR amplification, the results showed that B. velezensis CPA1–1 carried genes encoding the biosynthesis of various peptidoglycans, polyketone compounds and antimicrobial proteins, such as srfAA, ituA, fenA, dhbA, bmyA, beaS, and dfnA. Besides, the minimum inhibitory concentration of the fermented liquid of strain CPA1–1 against A. veronii, P. shigelloides, A. hydrophila, V. parahaemolyticus and C. freundii were 10⁴ to 10⁶ CFU/mL. The results of the safety test showed that the strain CPA1–1 had no adverse effects on M. nipponense, Siniperca chuatsi, Eriocheir sinensis and Procambarus clarkii. The strain CPA1–1 screened in this study has the good antibacterial ability. Therefore, it has the potential application prospects to prevent and control a variety of aquatic animal diseases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAeromonas hydrophila 3aAeromonas veronii 3aBacillus velezensis 3aCitrobacter freundii 3aEriocheir sinensis 3aMacrobrachium nipponense 3aPlesiomonas shigelloides 3aProcambarus clarkii 3aSiniperca chuatsi 3aVibrio parahaemolyticus 3aadverse effects 3aanimal diseases 3aantibacterial properties 3aantimicrobial proteins 3aaquatic animals 3abiosynthesis 3agenes 3aindicator species 3aliquids 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3apH 3apathogens 3apeptidoglycans 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aribosomal RNA 3asafety assessment 3asalinity 3asequence analysis 3atemperature 0aAntibiogram 0aThe minimum inhibitory concentration 0aAntibiotics related gene1 aGao, Xiaojian1 aZhang, Shuangming1 aJiang, Ziyan1 aYang, Hui1 aLiu, Xiaodan,1 aJiang, Qun1 aZhang, Xiaojun0 tAquaculture.g2020 June 30, v. 523 p.735165-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2020.7351653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02761naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002800152245011800180300001600298500001900314500002000333520138000353592002801733650002101761650001101782650002001793650001201813650002001825650001001845650001101855650001201866650003801878650001301916650002001929650000901949650001501958650001101973700001801984700001702002700002102019700002002040700001502060773011802075852000902193856008902202655001202291IND4410614920221121041511.0210417e200810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441061492DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1469-8137.2008.02539.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFajardo López, Mónica14aThe sugar porter gene family of Laccaria bicolor: function in ectomycorrhizal symbiosis and soil‐growing hyphae  ap. 365-378.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  a• Formation of ectomycorrhizas, a symbiosis with fine roots of woody plants, is one way for soil fungi to overcome carbohydrate limitation in forest ecosystems. • Fifteen potential hexose transporter proteins, of which 10 group within three clusters, are encoded in the genome of the ectomycorrhizal model fungus Laccaria bicolor. For 14 of them, transcripts were detectable. • When grown in liquid culture, carbon starvation resulted in at least twofold higher transcript abundances for seven genes. Temporarily elevated transcript abundance after sugar addition was observed for three genes. Compared with the extraradical mycelium, ectomycorrhiza formation resulted in a strongly enhanced expression of six genes, of which four revealed their highest observed transcript abundances in symbiosis. A function as hexose importer was proven for three of them. Only three genes, of which just one was expressed at a considerable level, revealed a reduced transcript content in mycorrhizas. • From gene expression patterns and import kinetics, the L. bicolor hexose transporters could be divided into two groups: those responsible for uptake of carbohydrates by soil‐growing hyphae, for improved carbon nutrition, and to reduce nutrient uptake competition by other soil microorganisms; and those responsible for efficient hexose uptake at the plant–fungus interface.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLaccaria bicolor 3acarbon 3aectomycorrhizae 3aforests 3agene expression 3agenes 3ahyphae 3aliquids 3amonosaccharide transport proteins 3amycelium 3anutrient uptake 3asoil 3astarvation 3asugars1 aDietz, Sandra1 aGrunze, Nina1 aBloschies, Jutta1 aWeiss, Michael,1 aNehls, Uwe0 tnew phytologist.g2008 Oct., v. 180, no. 2 p.365-378dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl44665x0028-646X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8137.2008.02539.x3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle01536naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002800145245012500173300001800298520049700316592002800813650002100841650002700862650001300889650001300902650002200915700002800937700002200965700002600987773011901013856008101132852000901213655001201222IND60557959620221122080920.0161104e20161007xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055795962DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.6b020442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRomero-Reyes, Moises

Backfilling has become one of the most frequently used mining method to solve this puzzle, as it can effectively control the movement of overlying strata and therefore soil and water resources will not be destroyed by mining activities. A new type of high-water swelling material (HWSM) was developed to address the key issues of current backfilling materials used in collieries, such as the high cost, inadequate strength and low expansion rate. Based on the principle that the strength of backfilling body satisfies the requirement, a critical ratio of water to solid material (a mixture of fly ash which was used as an aggregate, lime, anhydrite, cement and additive ingredients) was determined which varied from 0.8:1 to 0.9:1. Meanwhile, the mass ratio of fly ash, anhydrite, lime, cement and additives was determined to be 24.6:0.8:5.1:1.8:1. Laboratory tests showed that strength of samples that met the required setting time for practical use could reach 5.39–5.52 MPa after 63 days. The expansion rate after 3 h varied between 9.9 and 10.8 % and the bleeding rate ranged from 0.3 to 0.33 %. Industrial application has been conducted in Wangtaipu colliery and results showed that the proposed HWSM had an outstanding mechanical performance with good expansion rates and fluidity. These properties indicate that the developed material is suitable for use as a good backfilling material in mining so as to effectively reduce the ground surface subsidence and to conserve the soil and water.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadditives 3aanhydrite 3acement 3acoal 3afly ash 3ahemorrhage 3aindustrial applications 3aingredients 3alaboratory experimentation 3amining 3asoil water 3asubsidence 3awater conservation 3awater resources1 aMa, Liqiang1 aWang, Zhongwei1 aZhang, Dongsheng1 aLi, Ke1 aZhang, Yao1 aYi, Xingjun0 tEnvironmental earth sciences.g2016 May, v. 75, no. 9 p.779-779dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1866-62807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-016-5577-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03421naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001800155245014200173300001400315520167400329592002802003650003002031650001502061650001302076650001202089650001102101650001202112650001302124650001102137650001902148650001502167650001702182650000902199650000902208650001402217650001202231650001102243650001602254650002102270650001202291651001602303653001202319653002402331653001602355653001502371653001002386653001102396700002502407700002702432700002602459700002302485700002302508700001802531700002002549700001702569700002402586773007502610856008902685852000902774655001202783IND60556736620221120103838.0161102e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055673662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2016.08.1242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKato, Masashi10aUranium in well drinking water of Kabul, Afghanistan and its effective, low-cost depuration using Mg-Fe based hydrotalcite-like compounds  ap. 27-32.  aToxic elements in drinking water have great effects on human health. However, there is very limited information about toxic elements in drinking water in Afghanistan. In this study, levels of 10 elements (chromium, nickel, copper, arsenic, cadmium, antimony, barium, mercury, lead and uranium) in 227 well drinking water samples in Kabul, Afghanistan were examined for the first time. Chromium (in 0.9% of the 227 samples), arsenic (7.0%) and uranium (19.4%) exceeded the values in WHO health-based guidelines for drinking-water quality. Maximum chromium, arsenic and uranium levels in the water samples were 1.3-, 10.4- and 17.2-fold higher than the values in the guidelines, respectively. We next focused on uranium, which is the most seriously polluted element among the 10 elements. Mean ± SD (138.0 ± 1.4) of the 238U/235U isotopic ratio in the water samples was in the range of previously reported ratios for natural source uranium. We then examined the effect of our originally developed magnesium (Mg)-iron (Fe)-based hydrotalcite-like compounds (MF-HT) on adsorption for uranium. All of the uranium-polluted well water samples from Kabul (mean ± SD = 190.4 ± 113.9 μg/L; n = 11) could be remediated up to 1.2 ± 1.7 μg/L by 1% weight of our MF-HT within 60 s at very low cost (<0.001 cents/day/family) in theory. Thus, we demonstrated not only elevated levels of some toxic elements including natural source uranium but also an effective depurative for uranium in well drinking water from Kabul. Since our depurative is effective for remediation of arsenic as shown in our previous studies, its practical use in Kabul may be encouraged.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWorld Health Organization 3aadsorption 3aantimony 3aarsenic 3abarium 3acadmium 3achromium 3acopper 3adrinking water 3aguidelines 3ahuman health 3airon 3alead 3amagnesium 3amercury 3anickel 3aremediation 3atoxic substances 3auranium 3aAfghanistan 0aUranium 0aWell drinking water 0aAfghanistan 0aDepuration 0aMF-HT 0aICP-MS1 aAzimi, Mohammad Daud1 aFayaz, Said Hafizullah1 aShah, Muhammad Dawood1 aHoque, Md.

This paper aims at testing the robustness of such framing effects in the context of Provision Point Mechanisms (PPM). Our approach is original in that it combines both framing and provision point dimensions by comparing maintaining (taking from the public good) and creating (giving to the public good) contexts using Provision Point experiments. Consistent with previous findings, we find that individuals tend to be less cooperative in the maintaining frame than in the creating frame. Our results also show that the framing effects are stronger under a PPM than under a VCM and increase with the provision point level. These results may have important consequences for the management of environmental resources.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconservation programs 3aconsumer behavior 3aenvironmental management 3apurchasing1 aDenant-Boemont, Laurent1 aMasclet, David0 tEcological economics.g2011 Apr. 15, v. 70, no. 6 p.1200-1210dElsevier B.V.x0921-80097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolecon.2011.01.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03023naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001500155245011200170520150400282592002801786650002201814650002101836650002101857650001701878650001301895650002601908650002301934650002101957650002601978650002602004650003002030650001402060650001102074650001902085653001202104653001802116653002402134653001902158700001702177700001502194700001902209700001402228700001802242700001302260700001702273700001702290773009902307856009002406852000902496655001202505IND60684950520221118164235.0200503e20200630xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068495052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2020.7351592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Lei14aThe bacteria from large-sized bioflocs are more associated with the shrimp gut microbiota in culture system  aBiofloc technology (BFT) has been widely studied and applied in aquaculture, but the bacterial community compositions (BCCs) of bioflocs with different sizes and their associations with the shrimp gut microbiota remain unclear. In this study, bacterial communities of shrimp gut and the bioflocs with three different size-fractions (BS, < 20 μm; BM, 20–100 μm; BL, > 100 μm) were investigated by MiSeq sequencing technique. Significantly different bacterial communities were observed between the large (> 20 μm) and small (< 20 μm) -sized bioflocs. The linear discriminant analysis (LDA) showed that certain particle-bound bacteria, such as Rhodobacteraceae and Flavobacteriaceae were mainly enriched in large-sized bioflocs (> 20 μm). A majority of these taxa were strongly correlated with shrimp health or water environmental parameters. However, some candidate pathogens (i.e., Vibrionaceae, Mycoplasmataceae and Pseudoalteromonadaceae) were overrepresented in small-sized bioflocs (< 20 μm), and most of them exhibited negative correlation with shrimp growth parameters. Moreover, multiple analyses (Bray-Curtis dissimilarity analysis, Mantel test, SourceTracker analysis) revealed that the shrimp gut microbiota were more relevant to the bacterial communities of large-sized bioflocs, indicating that the shrimp gut microbiota may partly derived from large particle of bioflocs, and these bacteria driven by large particles may play an important role in promoting shrimp growth.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFlavobacteriaceae 3aMycoplasmataceae 3aRhodobacteraceae 3aVibrionaceae 3abacteria 3abacterial communities 3abiofloc technology 3adigestive system 3adiscriminant analysis 3aenvironmental factors 3aintestinal microorganisms 3apathogens 3ashrimp 3ashrimp culture 0aBiofloc 0aSize-fraction 0aBacterial community 0aGut microbiota1 aGuo, Haipeng1 aChen, Chen1 aHuang, Xiaolin1 aChen, Wei1 aBao, Fangjian1 aLiu, Wei1 aWang, Sipeng1 aZhang, Demin0 tAquaculture.g2020 June 30, v. 523 p.735159-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2020.7351593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02384naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005600148245011100204300001600315520094800331592002801279596006301307596008001370650002301450650002201473650002801495650001201523650002301535650001001558650001501568650001501583650002601598650000901624650000701633650001601640700001401656700001601670700001301686700001801699773014201717856008201859852000901941655001201950IND60687773520221120142206.0200404e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068777352DNAL7 a10.1007/s00449-020-02288-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKe, Chengzhu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7313-817X10aEffects of different expression systems on characterization of adenylate deaminase from Aspergillus oryzae  ap. 919-926.  aAdenylate deaminase (AMPD) is an amino hydrolase that catalyzes the irreversible hydrolysis of adenosine monophosphate (AMP) to inosine monophosphate (IMP) and ammonia. In this study, the effect of different hosts on the enzymatic properties of AMPD from Aspergillus oryzae GX-08 was investigated and showed that Bacillus subtilis WB600 was more suitable for producing AMPD with a higher activity of 2540 U/mL. After purification, the optimal temperature and pH of recombinant AMPD were 55 °C and pH 6.0, respectively, and its activity was significantly enhanced by 10 mM Fe³⁺ with an increase of 236%. More importantly, the recombinant AMPD specifically and effectively catalyzed the conversion between AMP and IMP, in which 10 mL of crude AMPD achieved a conversion ratio of 76.4% after 40 min. Therefore, B. subtilis WB600 provides a potential platform for producing AMPD with excellent catalytic ability and catalytic specificity.  aPublisher supplied data  a31560027cthe National Natural Science Foundation of China  a2017GXNSFAA198297 and 2016GXNSFAA380247cGuangxi Natural Science Foundation 3aAspergillus oryzae 3aBacillus subtilis 3aadenosine monophosphate 3aammonia 3acatalytic activity 3ahosts 3ahydrolases 3ahydrolysis 3ainosine monophosphate 3airon 3apH 3atemperature1 aLi, Shubo1 aCui, Yanyan1 aQiu, Hua1 aPang, Zongwen0 tBioprocess and biosystems engineering.g2020 May, v. 43, no. 5 p.919-926dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3920376x1615-75917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00449-020-02288-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02765naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002100155245016000176520128700336592002801623650001501651650002001666650001201686650001401698650001401712650002901726650001401755650001001769650000901779650001501788650001701803650002701820650001501847650001301862651001601875653001701891653002301908653003701931653001401968653001701982653002301999700001602022700002302038700001902061773009202080856009002172852000902262655001202271IND60688986320221121010134.0201125e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068898632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.1266042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThunnissen, N.W.10aEcological risks of imidacloprid to aquatic species in the Netherlands: Measured and estimated concentrations compared to species sensitivity distributions  aRecent declines of insects’ biomass have been a major point of interest.

The aim of our study was to assess the potential risk of imidacloprid for freshwater fauna in the Netherlands and to validate the SimpleBox model to allow application elsewhere. To this end, we compared imidacloprid concentrations estimated from emissions using the SimpleBox model to measurements obtained from monitoring databases and calculated the ecological risk based on measured concentrations for aquatic fauna. Imidacloprid concentration estimations were within the range measured, opening opportunities for application of SimpleBox to regions where measurements are limited. Aquatic insects were found to be most sensitive to imidacloprid while amphibians and fish are least sensitive to imidacloprid. In particular, the ecological risk of measured imidacloprid concentration in the Netherlands was 1%, implying that concentrations frequently exceed levels that are lethal in short-term experiments. Hence, based on lab toxicity data, the present study suggests that imidacloprid concentrations can be high enough to explain insect decline observed in the same areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamphibians 3aaquatic insects 3abiomass 3adatabases 3aemissions 3aenvironmental assessment 3aequations 3afauna 3afish 3afreshwater 3aimidacloprid 3ainsecticide resistance 3amonitoring 3atoxicity 3aNetherlands 0aImidacloprid 0aMacroinvertebrates 0aSpecies sensitivity distribution 0aSimpleBox 0aInsecticides 0aFreshwater species1 aLautz, L.S.1 avan Schaik, T.W.G.1 aHendriks, A.J.0 tChemosphere.g2020 Sept., v. 254 p.126604-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.1266043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01729naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245012600159300001800285520058300303592002800886650001200914650001100926650001500937650001500952650002000967650001000987650002000997650002401017650001401041700002001055700001601075700003001091700001701121773013401138856007401272852000901346655001201355IND60742123420221118025457.0210623e20210622xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074212342DNAL7 a10.1039/d1cc02245h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiang, Qiuming10aConstructing fused N-heterocycles from unprotected mesoionic N-heterocyclic olefins and organic azides via diazo transfer  ap. 6137-6140.  aMesoionic N-heterocyclic olefins (mNHOs) were first reported last year and their reactivity remains largely unexplored.

This requires high‐quality and high‐resolution spatiotemporal ecohydrological and socioeconomic information. We developed such an information base for integrated environmental flow management in the River Murray in South Australia (SA). A hydrological model was used to identify spatiotemporal inundation dynamics. River ecosystems were classified and mapped as ecohydrological units. Ecological response models were developed to link three aspects of environmental flows (flood duration, timing, and inter‐flood period) to the health responses of 16 ecological components at various life stages. Potential infrastructure investments (flow control regulators and irrigation pump relocation) were located by interpreting LiDAR elevation data, digital orthophotography, and wetland mapping information; and infrastructure costs were quantified using engineering cost models. Social values were quantified at a coarse scale as total economic value based on a national survey of willingness‐to‐pay for four key ecological assets; and at a local scale using mapped ecosystem service values. This information was integrated using a constrained, nonlinear, mixed‐integer, compromise programming optimization model and solved using a stochastic Tabu search algorithm. We tested the model uncertainty and sensitivity using 390 Monte Carlo model runs at varying weights of ecological health vs. social values. Integrating ecohydrological and socioeconomic information identified environmental flow management regimes that efficiently achieved both ecological and social objectives. Using an ecologically weighted efficient and socially weighted efficient scenario, we illustrated model outputs including a suite of cost‐effective infrastructure investments and an operational plan for new and existing flow control structures including dam releases, weir height manipulation, and regulator operation on a monthly time step. Both the investments and management regimes differed substantially between the two scenarios, suggesting that the choice of weightings on ecological and social objectives is important. This demonstrates the benefit of integrating high‐quality and high‐resolution spatiotemporal ecohydrological and socioeconomic information for guiding the investment in and operational management of environmental flows.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acost effectiveness 3aeconomic valuation 3aecosystem services 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental health 3ahydrologic models 3ainfrastructure 3airrigation 3alidar 3amodel uncertainty 3anational surveys 3aorthophotography 3arivers 3asocial benefit 3aweirs 3awetlands 3awillingness to pay 3aSouth Australia1 aHiggins, A1 aOverton, I.

For this reason, it is essential to make an exhaustive quantification of yield and quality benefits of the kernels because the regulated deficit irrigation will allow significant water savings with a minimum impact on yield while improving kernel quality. The goal of this scientific work was to study the influence of the rootstock, water deficit during pit hardening, and kernel roasting on pistachio (P. vera, cv. Kerman) fruit yield, fruit size, and kernel content of fatty acids phytoprostanes (PhytoPs) and phytofurans (PhytoFs) for the first time. Water stress during pit hardening did not affect the pistachio yield. The kernel cultivar showed a lower oleic acid and a higher linoleic acid contents than other cultivars. Kernels from plants grafted on the studied rootstocks showed very interesting characteristics. P. integerrima led to the highest percentage of monounsaturated fatty acids. Regarding the plant oxylipins, P. terebinthus led to the highest contents of PhytoPs and PhytoFs (1260 ng/100 g and 16.2 ng/100 g, respectively). In addition, nuts from trees cultivated under intermediate water deficit during pit hardening showed increased contents of the 9-series F₁-phytoprostanes and ent-16(RS)-9-epi-ST-Δ¹⁴-10-phytofuran. However, roasting of pistachios led to PhytoP degradation. Therefore, plant cultivar, deficit irrigation, rootstock, and roasting must be considered to enhance biosynthesis of these secondary metabolites. New tools using agricultural strategies to produce hydroSOS pistachios have been opened thanks to the biological properties of these prostaglandin-like compounds linking agriculture, nutrition, and food science technology for further research initiatives.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPistacia vera 3abiosynthesis 3acultivars 3adeficit irrigation 3adrought tolerance 3afood chemistry 3afruit size 3afruit yield 3alinoleic acid 3anutrition 3aoleic acid 3aoxylipins 3apistachios 3arootstocks 3asecondary metabolites 3aseeds 3awater stress 3aMediterranean region 0aphytoprostanes 0aphytofurans 0afatty acids 0aGC−MS 0aUHPLC−MS/MS1 aCano-Lamadrid, Marina1 aPérez-López, David1 aCarbonell-Barrachina, Ángel A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7163-29751 aCenteno, Ana1 aMedina, Sonia1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7231-64801 aGriñán, Isabel1 aGuy, Alexandre1 aGalano, Jean-Marie1 aDurand, Thierry1 aDomínguez-Perles, Raúl1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6232-712X1 aTorrecillas, Arturo1 aFerreres, Federico1 aGil-Izquierdo, Ángel1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7646-03860 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2020 July 20, v. 68, no. 33 p.8915-8924dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.0c029013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02893naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002200166245008900188300001600277520128900293592002801582650001501610650001201625650001401637650001601651650001401667650001501681650001301696650003001709650002001739650001801759650002001777650001001797650001901807650001201826650001201838650004301850650001801893650001401911650002601925651001101951653001101962653001201973653001401985700002101999700001602020700002402036700001902060700001802079773013902097856008202236852000902318655001202327IND60516195820221123034540.0190726e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051619582DNAL7 a257725212pmid7 a10.1017/S00074853150000852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Oliveira, C.D.10aBroader prevalence of Wolbachia in insects including potential human disease vectors  ap. 305-315.  aWolbachia are intracellular, maternally transmitted bacteria considered the most abundant endosymbionts found in arthropods.

Studies on distribution of Wolbachia among its arthropod hosts are important both for better understanding why this bacterium is so common, as well as for its potential use as a biological control agent. Here, we studied the incidence of Wolbachia in a broad range of insect species, collected from different regions of Brazil, using three genetic markers (16S rRNA, wsp and ftsZ), which varied in terms of their sensitivity to detect this bacterium. The overall incidence of Wolbachia among species belonging to 58 families and 14 orders was 61.9%. The most common positive insect orders were Coleoptera, Diptera, Hemiptera and Hymenoptera, with Diptera and Hemiptera having the highest numbers of Wolbachia-positive families. They included potential human disease vectors whose infection status has never been reported before. Our study further shows the importance of using quantitative polymerase chain reaction for high-throughput and sensitive Wolbachia screening.  aPublisher supplied data 3aColeoptera 3aDiptera 3aHemiptera 3aHymenoptera 3aWolbachia 3aarthropods 3abacteria 3abiological control agents 3adisease vectors 3aendosymbionts 3agenetic markers 3ahosts 3ahuman diseases 3ainsects 3aprogeny 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aribosomal RNA 3ascreening 3avector-borne diseases 3aBrazil 0aBrazil 0ainsects 0aWolbachia1 aGonçalves, D.S.1 aBaton, L.A.1 aShimabukuro, P.H.F.1 aCarvalho, F.D.1 aMoreira, L.A.0 tBulletin of entomological research.g2015 June, v. 105, no. 3 p.305-315dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl46143x1475-26707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00074853150000853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02344naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001800184245007700202300001600279506007600295520099600371592002801367506003701395650001301432650003101445650001601476650001401492650001801506650001901524650001601543700002401559700001901583700001901602700002001621700003001641773017101671856008301842852000901925655001201934IND4481208220221207133951.0120502e20120110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448120822DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.10191961092doi7 aPMC32586422pmcid7 a222039682pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Tingting10aNon-coalescence of oppositely charged droplets in pH-sensitive emulsions  ap. 384-389.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aLike charges stabilize emulsions, whereas opposite charges break emulsions. This is the fundamental principle for many industrial and practical processes. Using micrometer-sized pH-sensitive polymeric hydrogel particles as emulsion stabilizers, we prepare emulsions that consist of oppositely charged droplets, which do not coalesce. We observe noncoalescence of oppositely charged droplets in bulk emulsification as well as in microfluidic devices, where oppositely charged droplets are forced to collide within channel junctions. The results demonstrate that electrostatic interactions between droplets do not determine their stability and reveal the unique pH-dependent properties of emulsions stabilized by soft microgel particles. The noncoalescence can be switched to coalescence by neutralizing the microgels, and the emulsion can be broken on demand. This unusual feature of the microgel-stabilized emulsions offers fascinating opportunities for future applications of these systems.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3adroplets 3aelectrostatic interactions 3aemulsifying 3aemulsions 3ahydrocolloids 3aneutralization 3astabilizers1 aSeiffert, Sebastian1 aThiele, Julian1 aAbate, Adam R.1 aWeitz, David A.1 aRichtering, W.q(Walter),0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2012 Jan. 10, v. 109, no. 2 p.384-389dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.10191961093Available from publisher's Web site  aDNAL 7aarticle01412naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002400140245011000164300001600274520030200290592002800592650001400620650002700634650001800661650001100679650001100690700002300701700002200724700003100746700002700777700002300804700002100827773013100848856007400979852000901053655001201062IND60659950920221123025838.0190823e20131217xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065995092DNAL7 a10.1039/c3cc44939d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKovtunov, Kirill V.10aParahydrogen-induced polarization (PHIP) in heterogeneous hydrogenation over bulk metals and metal oxides  ap. 875-878.  aThe results show that, in general, observation of PHIP effects on metals does not require the presence of a support.

This study first established a simple, sensitive, and reliable liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry method for separation of R-DIC and S-DIC and their analyses. Then, it was applied to investigate the stereoselective pharmacokinetics and residual elimination of individual enantiomers, and their anticoccidial activity was also evaluated in broiler chickens. The results indicated that the area under the concentration–time curve (AUC) and elimination half-life (t₁/₂ᵦ) were significantly different (p < 0.05) for two enantiomers in chicken plasma. The AUC and t₁/₂ᵦ of S-DIC were approximately 2 and 1.4 times those of R-DIC, respectively. The residual elimination of DIC enantiomers in chicken tissues was also stereoselective. The concentrations of S-DIC in chicken muscle and liver were greater than those of R-DIC, and it is the opposite in the kidney. There was no significant difference (p > 0.05) in the anticoccidial activity of racemate and enantiomers when a single enantiomer in feed was added above 0.5 mg kg–¹. However, the anticoccidial activity of R-DIC (0.25 mg kg–¹) was significantly higher (p < 0.05) than that of S-DIC (0.25 mg kg–¹) in the diet. It should be mentioned that in chicken small intestine and cecum, the enantiomerization rate of each enantiomer in the infection group was faster than that in the uninfected group.  aPublisher supplied data 3acecum 3acoccidiosis 3adiclazuril 3adiet 3aenantiomerism 3aenantiomers 3afarms 3afood chemistry 3ahalf life 3akidneys 3aliquid chromatography 3aliver 3amuscles 3apharmacokinetics 3asmall intestine 3astereoselectivity 3atandem mass spectrometry 3atoxicity 0adiclazuril enantiomers 0astereoselective pharmacokinetics 0aactivity 0aresidues 0aliquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry 0achickens1 aQiu, Jingli1 aShu, Xiaogui1 aTang, Xiaoling1 aSha, Xuefang1 aWu, Li1 aFan, Jun1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2986-85511 aZeng, Dongping1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2006-57551 aHe, Rujian1 aZhang, Weiguang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3697-29901 aZeng, Zhenling1 aLiu, Rong1 aHe, Limin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8051-36390 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2020 July 21, v. 68, no. 33 p.8987-8995dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.0c030913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02934naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001300166245011400179300001600293520155200309592002801861650002401889650001701913650001301930650002701943650002501970650001101995650001002006650001602016650001202032650002302044653002402067653001302091653001602104653002702120653002002147700001302167700001602180700001102196700001302207700001402220773013902234856008202373852000902455655001202464IND60516196120221123014552.0190726e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051619612DNAL7 a257794832pmid7 a10.1017/S00074853150001402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiao, L.10aInheritance of photoperiodic control of larval diapause in the Asian corn borer Ostrinia furnacalis (Guenée)  ap. 326-334.  aThe Asian corn borer, Ostrinia furnacalis enters diapause as fully grown larvae. Owing to geographical variation in photoperiodic control of diapause, the subtropical strain from Hefei city (HF) enters diapause in response to short daylengths, whereas the tropical strain from Ledong county (LD) exhibits almost no diapause under the same conditions. The two strains were used in crosses to study the inheritance of diapause. The HF strain showed a typical long-day response with a critical daylength of approximately14.97 h at 22 °C, 14.60 h at 25 °C and 13.68 h at 28 °C. The LD strain showed weak photoperiodic responses at 22 and 25 °C; and the F₁ progeny also showed a long-day response with significantly shorter critical daylength compared with the HF strain. However, the LD × HF (F × M) crosses had significantly longer critical daylengths than HF × LD crosses, indicating a sexual bias in the inheritance of diapause induction, with the male parent having more influence on the F₁ progeny. The critical daylength in a backcross to HF was significantly longer than a backcross to LD. Whether the inheritance of diapause fits an additive hypothesis or not depended on photoperiod, with results from different photoperiods showing additive inheritance or incomplete dominance of either diapause or non-diapause. Unlike diapause induction, the duration of diapause for reciprocal crosses was equally influenced by each parent, suggesting that diapause incidence and maintenance are controlled by separate systems in O. furnacalis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOstrinia furnacalis 3abackcrossing 3adiapause 3ageographical variation 3aincomplete dominance 3alarvae 3amales 3aphotoperiod 3aprogeny 3areciprocal crosses 0aOstrinia furnacalis 0adiapause 0ainheritance 0aphotoperiodic response 0apaternal effect1 aHe, H.M.1 aZhong, P.S.1 aFu, S.1 aChen, C.1 aXue, F.S.0 tBulletin of entomological research.g2015 June, v. 105, no. 3 p.326-334dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl46143x1475-26707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00074853150001403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02681naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001300155245010200168520133600270592002801606650002401634650001701658650001901675650001601694650001601710650001001726650002201736650001401758650001401772650001901786653002001805653002101825653002401846700001601870700001301886700001701899700001401916700001601930700001501946700001701961700001701978700001801995773009902013856009002112852000902202655001202211IND60752231420221116193432.0220704e20220130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075223142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2021.7375332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Lili10aOrganic acid treatment for removal of epiphytic Ulva L. attached to Sargassum fusiforme seedlings  aThe attachment of epiphytes to Sargassum fusiforme seedings has become a serious problem in S. fusiforme aquaculture. In this study, we investigated the effect of citric acid on the attachment of Ulva lactuca to S. fusiforme seedlings. Seedlings of S. fusiforme were treated with different concentrations of citric acid (0.05 mol·L⁻¹, 0.08 mol·L⁻¹, 0.15 mol·L⁻¹) for different times (1, 3 and 5 min) and the death rate of the attached U. lactuca was measured. Citric acid treatment caused the death of U. lactuca, with the death rate increasing gradually with increasing concentrations of citric acid and treatment time. However, treatment with a high concentration of 0.15 mol·L⁻¹ citric acid for 5 min impaired electron transfer of the S. fusiforme seedlings, decreasing photosynthesis and causing irreversible damage to the seedlings, and eventually resulting in the rotting and subsequent death of the seedlings. Treatment of the S. fusiforme seedlings with 0.08 mol·L⁻¹ citric acid for 3 min was an optimal condition for the complete removal of epiphytic U. lactuca. Furthermore, subsequent culture of the treated seedlings by this optimal condition in the presence of 1.5 mg/L α-naphthaleneacetic acid during the recovery process was conducive to the normal growth of the S. fusiforme seedlings.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSargassum fusiforme 3aUlva lactuca 3aacid treatment 3aaquaculture 3acitric acid 3adeath 3aelectron transfer 3aepiphytes 3amortality 3aphotosynthesis 0aEpiphytic algae 0aEpiphyte control 0aSeaweed cultivation1 aLin, Lidong1 aLuo, Lin1 aZuo, Xiaojie1 aCao, Cong1 aJin, Xinyue1 aJin, Ajing1 aMa, Zengling1 aChen, Binbin1 aWu, Mingjiang0 tAquaculture.g2022 Jan. 30, v. 547 p.737533-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2021.7375333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02693naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245011700168520125600285592002801541650002101569650001701590650001101607650001001618650002101628650002801649650002001677650001401697650001101711650001501722653001301737653001901750653001501769653002101784653001501805653001601820700001801836700006001854700002601914700002401940700005901964773012202023856008102145852000902226655001202235IND60736319920221122223634.0211030e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073631992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2021.1116442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMattioli, Simona10aFormer foodstuff in mealworm farming: Effects on fatty acids profile, lipid metabolism and antioxidant molecules  aThe capability of some insects to be reared on by-products, waste and former foodstuff make them a very promising response to the increasing request of animals’ products. Mealworm larvae (Tenebrio molitor) are widely studied for feed and food purposes. In this study the effects of five diets were tested on the fatty acids (FA) profile, the lipid metabolism and the antioxidant molecules of the larvae. Three diets were composed by single ingredients as cookies, bread leftovers and brewery spent grains. Cookies were also mixed with bread or spent grains to increase the dietary lipids contents. Frass was studied to determine microbial contamination and FA/active biological molecules metabolisms. All the tested parameters were affected by the diets. Interestingly, beside the differences related to the diets, larvae showed a common trend in FA profile, with five FA representing between 87.25% and 94.59% of the total FAs (C18:1, C16:0, C18:2, C14:0 and C18:0). Lipid metabolism showed to be affected by FA profile of the diets, as well as retinol and tocopherol isoforms. Zeaxanthin, present into the diets, was not detected into the larvae but in the frass. Results point out a high nutritional value of mealworm larvae fed former foodstuff.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTenebrio molitor 3aantioxidants 3abreads 3afrass 3alipid metabolism 3amicrobial contamination 3anutritive value 3avitamin A 3awastes 3azeaxanthin 0aMealworm 0aEdible insects 0aOleic acid 0aLipid metabolism 0aBy-product 0aEntomophagy1 aPaci, Gisella1 aFratini, Filippo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1717-29471 aDal Bosco, Alessandro1 aTuccinardi, Tiziano1 aMancini, Simone1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8643-507X0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2021 July, v. 147 p.111644-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2021.1116443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03146naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100003300139245005500172300001800227500002000245520187100265592002802136650002502164650001002189650002502199650001102224650001302235650001202248650001102260650002302271650002002294650001302314650002502327650001102352650000902363650001002372650002202382650000902404651001102413700003102424700001902455773013202474856007302606852000902679655001202688IND60587629620221123003403.0180102e201307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058762962DNAL7 a10.1890/12-1728.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade la Peña-Domene, Marinés10aEarly recruitment dynamics in tropical restoration  ap. 1124-1134.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aUnassisted secondary succession in abandoned tropical pastures often results in species‐poor forests of pioneer trees that persist for decades. We characterize recruitment rates of woody vegetation in planting treatments during the first 60 months of experimental restoration on thin, eroded soils at Los Tuxtlas, southern Mexico. We test the hypothesis that recruitment of later‐successional trees is greater in fenced plots planted with native trees than in fenced controls that simulate natural succession, and further that recruitment of such species would be greater in plots planted with animal‐dispersed trees than in those planted with wind‐dispersed trees. Results indicated much greater recruitment of later‐successional animal‐dispersed trees in planted plots as compared with controls. Three censuses per year recorded 960 recruited individuals of 44 species of trees and shrubs from 20–60 months after cattle exclusion. Ninety‐six percent of recruits were not of planted species. Repeated‐measures analyses of variance indicated that recruited communities included more species of pioneers than of later‐successional trees and shrubs, with more individuals and species dispersed by animals than by wind. Recruitment of pioneers did not differ between control and planted plots. Later‐successional recruits dispersed by animals accumulated >10 times faster in planted than control plots, with apparent acceleration after planted Cecropia obtusifolia and Ficus yoponensis first produced fleshy fruits 48 months after cattle exclusion. Sparse later‐successional wind‐dispersed recruits did not differ by treatment. Our preliminary results over the first five years after cattle exclusion indicate that planted stands clearly accelerate succession through accumulation of later‐successional trees and shrubs dispersed by animals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCecropia obtusifolia 3aFicus 3aanalysis of variance 3acattle 3acensuses 3aforests 3afruits 3aindigenous species 3apioneer species 3aplanting 3asecondary succession 3ashrubs 3asoil 3atrees 3atropical pastures 3awind 3aMexico1 aMartínez-Garza, Cristina,1 aHowe, Henry F.0 tEcological applications.g2013 July, v. 23, no. 5 p.1124-1134dEcological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl47193x1051-07617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/12-1728.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03348naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001300166245014100179300001600320520168200336592002802018650002102046650001302067650001902080650002202099650001502121650001702136650001502153650001302168650001302181650001402194650001102208650001502219650001802234650001202252651001002264653002402274653002402298653002702322653002402349653003102373653002102404700001402425700001802439700001102457700001602468700001102484700001702495700001602512700001202528773013902540856008202679852000902761655001202770IND60516196220221122235952.0190726e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051619622DNAL7 a257796522pmid7 a10.1017/S00074853150001522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShen, J.10aConstruction of a GeogDetector-based model system to indicate the potential occurrence of grasshoppers in Inner Mongolia steppe habitats  ap. 335-346.  aGrasshopper plagues have seriously disturbed grassland ecosystems in Inner Mongolia, China. The accurate prediction of grasshopper infestations and control of grasshopper plagues have become urgent needs. We sampled 234, 342, 335, and 369 plots in Xianghuangqi County of Xilingol League in 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013, respectively, and measured the density of the most dominant grasshopper species, Oedaleus decorus asiaticus, and the latitude, longitude, and associated relatively stable habitat factors at each plot. We used Excel–GeogDetector software to explore the effects of individual habitat factors and the two-factor interactions on grasshopper density. We estimated the membership of each grasshopper density rank and determined the weights of each habitat category. These results were used to construct a model system evaluating grasshopper habitat suitability. The results showed that our evaluation system was reliable and the fuzzy evaluation scores of grasshopper habitat suitability were good indicators of potential occurrence of grasshoppers. The effects of the two-factor interactions on grasshopper density were greater than the effects of any individual factors. O. d. asiaticus was most likely to be found at elevations of 1300–1400 m, flat terrain or slopes of 4–6°, typical chestnut soil with 70–80% sand content in the top 5 cm of soil, and medium-coverage grassland. The species preferred temperate bunchgrass steppe dominated by Stipa krylovii and Cleistogenes squarrosa. These findings may be used to improve models to predict grasshopper occurrence and to develop management guidelines to control grasshopper plagues by changing habitats.  aPublisher supplied data 3aKengia squarrosa 3aOedaleus 3aStipa krylovii 3acomputer software 3aecosystems 3agrasshoppers 3aguidelines 3ahabitats 3alatitude 3alongitude 3amodels 3aprediction 3asand fraction 3asteppes 3aChina 0aGrasshopper density 0ahabitat suitability 0atwo-factor interaction 0amembership analysis 0aanalytic hierarchy process 0afuzzy evaluation1 aZhang, N.1 aGexigeduren, 1 aHe, B.1 aLiu, C.

A promising strategy to reduce pest pressure on crops is to increase the plant diversity in agroecosystems. This approach, however, demands a sound understanding of species' interactions, which is widely lacking for subterranean herbivore–plant systems. Here, we examine the effects of plant diversification on wireworms, the soil‐dwelling larvae of click beetles that threaten crops worldwide. We conducted a field experiment employing plant diversification by adding either wheat or a mix of six associated plants (grasses, legumes, and forbs) between rows of maize to protect it from Agriotes wireworms. Wireworm feeding behavior, dispersal between crop and associated plants, as well as maize damage and yield were examined. The former was assessed combining molecular gut content and stable isotope analysis. The pests were strongly attracted by the associated plants in August, when the crop was most vulnerable, whereas in September, shortly before harvest, this effect occurred only in the plant mix. In maize monoculture, the larvae stayed in the principal crop throughout the season. Larval δ¹³C signatures revealed that maize feeding was reduced up to sevenfold in wireworms of the vegetationally diversified treatments compared to those of the maize monoculture. These findings were confirmed by molecular analysis, which additionally showed a dietary preference of wireworms for specific plants in the associated plant mix. Compared to the monoculture, maize damage was reduced by 38% and 55% in the wheat and plant mix treatment, which translated into a yield increase of 30% and 38%, respectively. The present findings demonstrate that increasing the plant diversity in agroecosystems provides an effective insurance against soil pests. The underlying mechanisms are the diversion of the pest from the principle crop and a changed feeding behavior. The deployment of diverse mixes of associated plants, tailored to the specific preferences of the soil herbivores, provides a promising strategy for managing subterranean pests while maintaining crop yield.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgriotes 3aagroecosystems 3acarbon 3acorn 3acrop damage 3acrop yield 3acrops 3adigestive system 3afeeding behavior 3afield experimentation 3aforbs 3agrasses 3aherbivores 3alarvae 3alegumes 3apests 3asoil 3aspecies diversity 3astable isotopes 3awheat1 aSchallhart, Nikolaus1 aThalinger, Bettina1 aWallinger, Corinna1 aJuen, Anita1 aTraugott, Michael0 tEcological applications.g2013 July, v. 23, no. 5 p.1135-1145dEcological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl47193x1051-07617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/13-0018.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01120naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002100138245007200159300001600231520021400247592002800461650001300489650002300502650001300525650001100538650001300549700002900562700001900591773012600610856007300736852000900809655001200818IND60657505720221121081151.0190816e20040325xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065750572DNAL7 a10.1039/b400978a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTrask, Andrew V.10aSolvent-drop grinding: green polymorph control of cocrystallisation  ap. 890-891.  aBy grinding with a minimal addition of a solvent of appropriate polarity, control over the polymorphic outcome of a novel cocrystallisation involving the model pharmaceutical compound caffeine may be achieved.  aPublisher supplied data 3acaffeine 3achemical reactions 3agrinding 3amodels 3asolvents1 aMotherwell, W.

D. suzukii is a direct pest, ovipositing directly into ripe or ripening fruits; in contrast, other Drosophilids utilize decaying or blemished fruits and are nuisance pests at worst. Immature stages of D. suzukii are difficult to differentiate from other Drosophilids, posing problems for research and for meeting quarantine restrictions designed to prevent the spread of this pest in fruit exports. Here we used a combined phylogenetic and bioinformatic approach to discover genetic markers suitable for a species diagnostic protocol of this agricultural pest. We describe a molecular diagnostic for rapid identification of single D. suzukii larva using multiplex polymerase chain reaction. Our molecular diagnostic was validated using nine different species of Drosophila for specificity and 19 populations of D. suzukii from different geographical regions to ensure utility within species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDrosophila suzukii 3abioinformatics 3aexports 3afinancial economics 3afruit crops 3afruits 3agenetic markers 3agenomics 3aimmatures 3apests 3aphylogeny 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aquarantine 3aripening 3aCanada 3aEurope 3aUnited States 0aspotted wing drosophila 0aDrosophila suzukii 0aspecies-specific PCR 0ainvasive pest 0acomparative genomics1 aUnruh, T.R.1 aZhou, L.M.1 aZalom, F.G.1 aShearer, P.W.1 aBeers, E.H.1 aWalton, V.M.1 aMiller, B.1 aChiu, J.C.0 tBulletin of entomological research.g2015 June, v. 105, no. 3 p.364-372dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl46143x1475-26707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00074853150002183Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle03686naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245008100162300001800243500002000261520231600281592002802597650002402625650001702649650003002666650002602696650002602722650002402748650002002772650001502792650001502807650001802822650002002840650000902860650002302869651003102892700001502923700001802938700001902956700001902975700002002994773013203014856007303146852000903219655001203228IND60587629920221123003338.0180102e201307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058762992DNAL7 a10.1890/12-1878.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSorice, Michael G.10aIncreasing participation in incentive programs for biodiversity conservation  ap. 1146-1155.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aEngaging private landowners in conservation activities for imperiled species is critical to maintaining and enhancing biodiversity. Market‐based approaches can incentivize conservation behaviors on private lands by shifting the benefit–cost ratio of engaging in activities that result in net conservation benefits for target species. In the United States and elsewhere, voluntary conservation agreements with financial incentives are becoming an increasingly common strategy. While the influence of program design and delivery of voluntary conservation programs is often overlooked, these aspects are critical to achieving the necessary participation to attain landscape‐scale outcomes. Using a sample of family‐forest landowners in the southeast United States, we show how preferences for participation in a conservation program to protect an at‐risk species, the gopher tortoise (Gopherus polyphemus), are related to program structure, delivery, and perceived efficacy. Landowners were most sensitive to programs that are highly controlling, require permanent conservation easements, and put landowners at risk for future regulation. Programs designed with greater levels of compensation and that support landowners' autonomy to make land management decisions can increase participation and increase landowner acceptance of program components that are generally unfavorable, like long‐term contracts and permanent easements. There is an inherent trade‐off between maximizing participation and maximizing the conservation benefits when designing a conservation incentive program. For conservation programs targeting private lands to achieve landscape‐level benefits, they must attract a critical level of participation that creates a connected mosaic of conservation benefits. Yet, programs with attributes that strive to maximize conservation benefits within a single agreement (and reduce risks of failure) are likely to have lower participation, and thus lower landscape benefits. Achieving levels of landowner participation in conservation agreement programs that deliver lasting, landscape‐level benefits requires careful attention not only to how the program structure influences potential conservation benefits, but also how it influences landowners and their potential to participate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGopherus polyphemus 3abiodiversity 3abiodiversity conservation 3aconservation programs 3acost benefit analysis 3aeconomic incentives 3aland management 3alandowners 3alandscapes 3aprivate lands 3aright of access 3arisk 3athreatened species 3aSoutheastern United States1 aOh, Chi-Ok1 aGartner, Todd1 aSnieckus, Mary1 aJohnson, Rhett1 aDonlan, C.

This study documented how different density of mealybug Pseudococcus longispinus (Targioni Tozzetti) infestation is associated with a response of antioxidative systems of Phalaenopsis × hybridum ‘Innocence’. The degree of cell damage, estimated by electrolyte leakage measurement and the level of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), the content of pigments as well as the activity of antioxidative enzymes and proline level, as measurements of stress and stress compensation in moth orchid were examined. The highest electrolyte leakage (E L) value among samples from colonized plants was found in the orchids from series III (50 individuals/plant), whereas the lowest in the plants from series II (20 individuals/plant). The TBARS content reached the highest level at the lowest number of feeding insects (series I). Peroxidase activity toward guaiacol was significantly increased in series I (5 individuals/plant). The highest catalase activity was recorded in plants colonized by the highest number of scale insects (series III). Whereas, the highest value of proline was in series II. The content of individual photosynthetic pigments (chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b and carotenoids) in plant tissues did not vary significantly between control and colonized orchids. The results have not confirmed hypothesis that the increasing number of mealybugs occurring on plant enhanced plant physiological response. The degree of longtailed mealybug infestation on plants was positively correlated only with electrolyte leakage and catalase activity in leaf tissues.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhalaenopsis 3aPseudococcus longispinus 3acarotenoids 3acatalase 3achlorophyll 3acorrelation 3aelectrolytes 3aenzyme activity 3aguaiacol 3aleaves 3aperoxidase 3aphysiological response 3apigments 3aplant tissues 3aproline 3ascale insects 3athiobarbituric acid-reactive substances 0alongtailed mealybug 0aTBARS 0aelectrolyte leakage 0aantioxidants 0aphotosynthetic pigments1 aKmieć, K.1 aGórska-Drabik, E.1 aGolan, K.1 aRubinowska, K.1 aŁagowska, B.0 tBulletin of entomological research.g2015 June, v. 105, no. 3 p.373-380dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl46143x1475-26707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S000748531500022X3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02594naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001400153245010800167300001400275520136200289592002801651650001201679650001501691650001501706650002601721650001301747650001801760651001101778653001801789653002601807653001701833653002101850653002101871700002001892700001801912700001801930700002101948773011801969856008802087852000902175655001202184IND60573035820221120100449.0180830e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057303582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.resconrec.2017.05.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRex, Emma12aA systems perspective on chemical production from mixed food waste: The case of bio-succinate in Sweden  ap. 86-97.  aThe option of producing the chemical succinic acid from bio-based resources is well in line with current political and industrial ambitions for a bio-based economy. A little explored but intriguing biomass feedstock opportunity is food waste. Mixed food waste is especially appealing as it represents less resource competition than more homogenous food waste fractions. The feasibility of producing succinic acid from mixed food waste depends on both technical and societal system structures. Therefore, to assess the production prospect, it is important to investigate all relevant system components. This study explores from such multiple perspectives the feasibility of chemical production as a viable added pathway for mixed food waste, using microbial production of succinic acid from municipal solid waste in Sweden as an example. The perspectives explored are: 1) feedstock feasibility, 2) societal drivers and barriers for technology progress, and 3) resource availability. Findings show that even though, from a technical feasibility and resource availability perspective, production seems possible, it lacks institutional support and actor commitment and alignment for development in Sweden. Findings also show that a holistic and interdisciplinary systems perspective contributes valuable insight when assessing prospects for bio-based chemicals.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3afeedstocks 3afood waste 3amunicipal solid waste 3apolitics 3asuccinic acid 3aSweden 0aSuccinic acid 0aMunicipal solid waste 0aBio-refinery 0aSystems approach 0aWaste management1 aRosander, Erica1 aRøyne, Frida1 aVeide, Andres1 aUlmanen, Johanna0 tResources, conservation, and recycling.g2017 Oct., v. 125 p.86-97dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11928x0921-34497nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2017.05.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03350naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001700094024002100111024003300132024002200165024001900187024001100206040001800217100001800235245012100253300001800374506007600392506017300468520128600641592002801927506003701955650000801992650001402000650002202014650002002036650001002056650001602066650001902082650001102101650002202112650001502134650002502149650001402174650002602188653002502214653002202239700002202261700001702283773019202300856011202492856007902604956009502683961000902778852000902787655001202796IND50089445220221214225549.0150604e20140429xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008944522DNAL7 a3028942aris7 a10113/587622hdl7 a10.1073/pnas.14022431112doi7 aPMC40359262pmcid7 a247338932pmid8 ans4461  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Soon Goo10aStructural basis for regulation of rhizobial nodulation and symbiosis gene expression by the regulatory protein NolR  ap. 6509-6514.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aThe symbiosis between rhizobial microbes and host plants involves the coordinated expression of multiple genes, which leads to nodule formation and nitrogen fixation. As part of the transcriptional machinery for nodulation and symbiosis across a range of Rhizobium, NolR serves as a global regulatory protein. Here, we present the X-ray crystal structures of NolR in the unliganded form and complexed with two different 22-base pair (bp) double-stranded operator sequences (oligos AT and AA). Structural and biochemical analysis of NolR reveals protein–DNA interactions with an asymmetric operator site and defines a mechanism for conformational switching of a key residue (Gln56) to accommodate variation in target DNA sequences from diverse rhizobial genes for nodulation and symbiosis. This conformational switching alters the energetic contributions to DNA binding without changes in affinity for the target sequence. Two possible models for the role of NolR in the regulation of different nodulation and symbiosis genes are proposed. To our knowledge, these studies provide the first structural insight on the regulation of genes involved in the agriculturally and ecologically important symbiosis of microbes and plants that leads to nodule formation and nitrogen fixation.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aRhizobium 3acrystal structure 3agene expression 3agenes 3ahost plants 3amicroorganisms 3amodels 3anitrogen fixation 3anodulation 3anucleotide sequences 3asymbiosis 3atranscription factors 0atranscription factor 0aprotein structure1 aKrishnan, Hari B.1 aJez, Joseph,0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2014 Apr. 29, v. 111, no. 17 p.6509-6514dNational Academy of ScienceswJournal:jnl45680x0027-84247nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/587623Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.14022431113Available from publisher's site  aARIS submissionbhttp://submit-u.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/Krishnan%20PNAS.pdf  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle02390naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002100146245013300167300001800300500001900318520094600337592002801283650002101311650001201332650001101344650002801355650001901383650001201402650001801414650001301432650001301445650001701458650002201475650001801497653002501515653002601540653002201566653001901588653001401607700001601621700005801637773014801695856008001843852000901923655001201932IND60707328820221118205953.0200819e20200804xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070732882DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.0c036712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Zhongren,12aA Strategy to Improve Production of Recombinant Proteins in Escherichia coli Based on a Glucose–Glycerol Mixture and Glutamate  ap. 8883-8889.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aEnzymes have a wide range of applications in many sectors of the industry, and the market value has skyrocketed in recent years. Glucose and glycerol are two renewable carbon sources of importance. Therefore, it is appealing to produce recombinant enzymes with these carbon substrates on the basis of economic viability. In this study, glycerol metabolism and glucose metabolism in Escherichia coli (E. coli) were manipulated in a systematic way. In addition, glutamate (Glu) was used for replacement of yeast extract to reduce the cost and the quality-variation problem. A strategy was further developed to incorporate Glu into the central metabolism. The engineered E. coli strain finally enabled efficient co-utilization of glucose and glycerol and improved biomass and protein production by 4.3 and 8.2-folds, respectively. The result illustrates that this proposed approach is promising for effective production of recombinant proteins.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3abiomass 3acarbon 3aeconomic sustainability 3afood chemistry 3aglucose 3aglutamic acid 3aglycerol 3aindustry 3amarket value 3aprotein synthesis 3ayeast extract 0arecombinant proteins 0ametabolic engineering 0arenewable carbons 0acarbon mixture 0aglutamate1 aHu, Mu-Chen1 aChao, Yun-Peng1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7997-07520 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2020 Aug. 04, v. 68, no. 33 p.8883-8889dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.0c036713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03883naa a2200913 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245012900164300001400293520144600307592002801753650001601781650001201797650002501809650002201834650002001856650001601876650001601892650002301908650002301931650001601954650006601970650001702036650002602053650003702079650002302116650001802139650001402157650001302171650001502184650004302199650002402242650001502266650001002281650002002291650003602311653000702347653000902354653001702363653000802380653000802388653000902396653001102405653000802416653000802424653000902432653000802441653000702449653000902456653001302465653000902478653001802487653001102505653000702516653001302523653001302536653000802549653000902557653000802566653000802574653000702582653003502589653002202624653001502646653001502661653002302676700001702699700001902716700002002735700001702755773009302772856008302865852000902948655001202957IND60530137020221119142701.0180830e20160210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053013702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gene.2015.11.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Shuqin10aIntegrative transcriptomics and proteomics analysis of longissimus dorsi muscles of Canadian double-muscled Large White pigs  ap. 14-23.  aCanadian double-muscled Large White pigs are characterized by notable muscle mass, showing high daily gain and lean rate and good meat quality. In order to identify the major genes or proteins involved in muscle hyperplasia and hypertrophy, three pairs of full-sib pigs with extreme muscle mass difference from Canadian Large White were selected as experimental animals at 3months age. The phenotypic differences of longissimus dorsi muscles (LD) were investigated with microarray and proteomics (2-DE, MALDI-TOF-MS), and results were verified by real-time PCR and western bolting respectively. The gene expressing profiling identified 57 and 260 and 147 differently expressed genes (DEGs) from the three pairs respectively with Bayesian statistics and significant analysis of microarrays (SAM) (p<0.05, q<0.05, fold>2). From the network of these DEGs, some major genes were displayed, such as EGF, PPARG, FN1, SERPINE1, MYC, JUN, involved in Wnt, MAPK and TGF-β signal pathway respectively, which mainly participated in cell differentiation and proliferation. In parallel, proteomics analyses revealed 50 differently expressed protein (DEP) spots with mass spectrum, and 33 spots of them were found annotated, which took part in energy metabolism and the structure and contraction of muscle fiber. In brief, our integrated study provides a good foundation for the further study on the genetic mechanism of the double muscle traits in pigs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLarge White 3abolting 3acell differentiation 3aenergy metabolism 3agene expression 3ahyperplasia 3ahypertrophy 3alaboratory animals 3alongissimus muscle 3amajor genes 3amatrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization mass spectrometry 3ameat quality 3amicroarray technology 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3amuscle contraction 3amuscle fibers 3aphenotype 3aproteins 3aproteomics 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asignal transduction 3astatistics 3aswine 3atranscriptomics 3atransforming growth factor beta 0aLD 0a2-DE 0aMALDI-TOS-MS 0aDEG 0aSAM 0aMAPK 0aTGF-β 0aDEP 0aBSA 0acDNA 0aDTT 0aDM 0aMyHC 0aMyHC IIB 0aPAGE 0aReal-time PCR 0aRT-PCR 0aNM 0aIGF-I/II 0aSDS-PAGE 0aSNP 0aTris 0aμg 0aμl 0aMg 0aDouble-muscled Large White pig 0aLongissimus dorsi 0aMicroarray 0aProteomics 0aMuscle development1 aHan, Wenpeng1 aJiang, Shunyan1 aZhao, Chunjiang1 aWu, Changxin0 tGene.g2016 Feb. 10, v. 577, no. 1 p.14-23dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6378x0378-11197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2015.11.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04185naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001800166245018000184300001600364520222500380592002802605650000802633650001802641650001602659650002202675650001102697650002502708650001202733650001002745650001502755650001402770650002402784650001502808650002302823650002102846650001202867650001502879650001102894650001002905650001502915650001602930650001702946650002702963650001202990651002103002651001503023653001903038653002203057653003903079653002703118653004803145653002803193653003203221700001503253700001703268700002003285773013903305856008203444852000903526655001203535IND60516196720221123014513.0190726e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051619672DNAL7 a259914112pmid7 a10.1017/S00074853150003832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBlacket, M.J.10aDNA-based identifications reveal multiple introductions of the vegetable leafminer Liriomyza sativae (Diptera: Agromyzidae) into the Torres Strait Islands and Papua New Guinea  ap. 533-544.  aLeafmining flies (Diptera: Agromyzidae) can be serious economic pests of horticultural crops. Some genera such as Liriomyza are particularly problematic with numerous species, some of which are highly polyphagous (wide host range), which can only be confidently identified morphologically from adult males. In our study, DNA barcoding was employed to establish new locality records of the vegetable leafminer fly, Liriomyza sativae, from the islands of Torres Strait (Queensland, Australia) and the central highlands of Papua New Guinea (PNG). These records represent significant range extensions of this highly invasive plant pest. Specimens of immature leafminers (from leaf mines) were collected over a 5-year period during routine plant health surveys in ethanol or on FTA® filter paper cards, both methods proved effective at preserving and transporting insect DNA under tropical conditions, with FTA cards possessing some additional logistical benefits. Specimens were identified through sequencing two sections of the cytochrome oxidase I gene and the utility of each was assessed for the identification of species and intra-specific genetic lineages. Our study indicates that multiple haplotypes of L. sativae occur in PNG, while a different haplotype is present in the Torres Strait, with genetic regionalization between these areas apart from a single possible instance – one haplotype ‘S.7’ appears to be common between these two regions – interestingly this has also been the most common haplotype detected in previous studies of invasive L. sativae populations. The DNA barcoding methods employed here not only identified multiple introductions of L. sativae, but also appear generally applicable to the identification of other agromyzid leafminers (Phytomyzinae and Agromyzinae) and should decrease the likelihood of potentially co-amplifying internal hymenopteran parasitoids. Currently, L. sativae is still not recorded from the Australian mainland; however, further sampling of leafminer flies from Northern Australia and surrounding areas is required, as surveillance for possible Liriomyza incursions, as well as to characterize endemic species with which Liriomyza species might be confused.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDNA barcoding 3aHymenoptera 3aLiriomyza sativae 3aadults 3acytochrome-c oxidase 3aethanol 3agenes 3ahaplotypes 3ahighlands 3ahorticultural crops 3ahost range 3aindigenous species 3ainvasive species 3aislands 3aleafminers 3aleaves 3amales 3amonitoring 3aparasitoids 3aplant health 3aspecies identification 3asurveys 3aPapua New Guinea 3aQueensland 0aLeafmining fly 0aLiriomyza sativae 0aNew records: Torres Strait Islands 0aPapua New Guinea (PNG) 0aQuarantine/Biosecurity: invasive plant pest 0aDNA barcoding: COI gene 0aDNA preservation: FTA cards1 aRice, A.D.1 aSemeraro, L.1 aMalipatil, M.B.0 tBulletin of entomological research.g2015 Oct., v. 105, no. 5 p.533-544dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl46143x1475-26707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00074853150003833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02200naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005700150245011900207300002000326500001500346520093900361592002801300650001501328650002101343650001801364650001501382650001201397650001601409650001901425650001501444653002301459700006101482700001601543700002401559700002201583773011601605856008401721852000901805655001201814IND60624612720221119055806.0181204e20181109xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062461272DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.8b028492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLim, Wei Yang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6954-319910aLiquid Combination with High Refractive Index Contrast and Fast Scanning Speeds for Electrowetting Adaptive Optics  ap. 14511-14518.  a2019-12-06  aElectrowetting adaptive optical devices are versatile, with applications ranging from microscopy to remote sensing. The choice of liquids in these devices governs its tuning range, temporal response, and wavelength of operation.

Measured maximum scanning angle was realized at ±13.7° in a two-electrode prism, with simulation predictions of ±18.2°. The liquid’s switching time to reach 90° contact angle from rest, in a 4 mm diameter device, was measured at 100 ms. Steady-state scanning with a two-electrode prism showed linear and consistent scan angles of ±4.8° for a 20 V differential between the two electrodes, whereas beam scanning using the liquid system achieved ±1.74° at 500 Hz for a voltage differential of 80 V.  aPublisher supplied data 3amicroscopy 3arefractive index 3acontact angle 3aelectrodes 3aliquids 3awavelengths 3aremote sensing 3aprediction 0aelectric potential1 aSupekar, Omkar D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1777-85081 aZohrabi, Mo1 aGopinath, Juliet T.1 aBright, Victor M.0 tLangmuir.g2018 Nov. 09, v. 34, no. 48 p.14511-14518dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19170x1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.8b028493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02978naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002200155245011700177300001400294520127800308592002801586650001301614650002001627650000901647650001001656650001101666650001501677650001501692650001401707650002401721650002201745650001201767650002001779650001801799650001401817653001201831653001801843653001701861653001801878653002501896653002401921653000901945653002401954653002401978653002302002653001002025653002002035700001902055700002202074700002202096700001802118700002002136700001502156773010602171856009002277852000902367655001202376IND60573036120221122153719.0190405e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057303612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.smallrumres.2016.12.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarbagianni, M.S.10aUltrasonographic examination of pregnant ewes: From early diagnosis of pregnancy to early prediction of dystocia  ap. 41-55.  aUltrasonographic examination has been established as the most valuable method for early and accurate pregnancy diagnosis in ewes. Early and accurate diagnosis of pregnancy is particularly useful for correct health management of flocks during gestation. It is also important to study pregnancy processes and foetal development with a non-invasive method, as ultrasonographic examination, because various events might affect normal development of foetus and viability of offspring. Evaluation of normal physiological pregnancy progress and outcome, as well as pregnancy disorders and peri-parturient disorders are significant in sheep health management. Hence, ability to perform pregnancy diagnosis and to identify common pathological conditions of pregnant ewes is of importance to clinicians active in sheep practice. Further, monitoring of foetal growth during pregnancy is useful for those working with sheep. Moreover, various disorders of pregnant ewes (e.g., pregnancy toxaemia) can lead to dystocia and it would be beneficial to predict such cases, if any of these disorders has been diagnosed. In all the above circumstances, ultrasonographic examination can support the veterinarian in reaching a diagnosis and in taking decisions for management of each situation.  aPublisher supplied data 3adystocia 3aearly diagnosis 3aewes 3afetus 3aflocks 3amonitoring 3aprediction 3apregnancy 3apregnancy diagnosis 3apregnancy toxemia 3aprogeny 3aultrasonography 3aveterinarians 3aviability 0aDoppler 0aFoetal growth 0aFoetal count 0aFoetal sexing 0aMultiple pregnancies 0aIntrauterine growth 0aLamb 0aPerinatal mortality 0aPregnancy diagnosis 0aPregnancy toxaemia 0aSheep 0aUltrasonography1 aIoannidi, K.I.1 aVasileiou, N.G.C.1 aMavrogianni, V.S.1 aOrfanou, D.C.1 aFthenakis, G.C.1 aValasi, I.0 tSmall ruminant research.g2017 July, v. 152 p.41-55dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl44843x0921-44887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.smallrumres.2016.12.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02964naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245008900170300001400259520171700273592002801990650001802018650000802036650001602044650002802060650001202088650002302100650001102123650001802134650001702152650001302169650002002182650001302202650000702215650001902222650001902241700001402260700002102274700001702295700001802312773009802330856008102428852000902509655001202518IND60120137020221118154552.0151114e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012013702DNAL7 a10.1007/s13594-014-0199-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSilva, N. Nogueira10aAFM study of casein micelles cross-linked by genipin: effects of acid pH and citrate  ap. 75-86.  aCasein micelles (CMs) are supramolecular structures highly dependent on their mineral content, especially colloidal calcium phosphate. When colloidal calcium phosphate is removed, the micellar structures dissociate and release minerals and casein molecules in the continuous phase. The aim of this work was to study the effects of solubilization of the colloidal calcium phosphate induced by acidification or addition of sodium citrate (100 mmol.L⁻¹) on the structure of cross-linked CMs using atomic force microscopy (AFM). AFM was used to determine the dimensional characteristics, height, diameter, and contact angle of control and cross-linked CMs. To this end, micellar suspensions were cross-linked by genipin and then acidified or demineralized. Colloidal calcium was solubilized, and the results showed that the cross-linked CMs retained more calcium than control CMs. The AFM analysis revealed that control CMs were deformed after immobilization and shrunk upon acidification. As control CMs dissociated in the presence of citrate, dimensional characteristics were not determined by AFM. The cross-linked CMs were also deformed on immobilization but to a lesser extent than control ones. The dimensional characteristics of cross-linked CMs were not modified by acidification. Conversely, demineralization by citrate induced structural rearrangement of the micellar structures. The higher structural resistance of cross-linked CMs was related to intramicellar cross-links between basic amino acids (lysyl and arginyl residues) present in casein molecules. Although AFM was performed in the air, it allowed us to know how the ionic environment modulates the intrinsic nanomechanical properties of CMs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidification 3aair 3aamino acids 3aatomic force microscopy 3acalcium 3acalcium phosphates 3acasein 3acontact angle 3acrosslinking 3amicelles 3amineral content 3aminerals 3apH 3asodium citrate 3asolubilization1 aBahri, A.1 aGuyomarc’h, F.1 aBeaucher, E.1 aGaucheron, F.0 tDairy science & technology.g2015 Jan., v. 95, no. 1 p.75-86dSpringer Parisx1958-55867nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13594-014-0199-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02646naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002200155245005500177300001400232520131100246592002801557650000901585650001101594650001401605650001601619650001301635650002201648650002101670650001101691650002001702653001201722653001401734653000801748653001801756653002301774653001301797653001501810653001001825653000901835653002001844700002201864700002201886700002001908700001901928773010601947856009002053852000902143655001202152IND60573036220221120124605.0190405e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057303622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.smallrumres.2016.12.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarbagianni, M.S.10aUltrasonographic examination of the udder in sheep  ap. 86-99.  aObjective of the paper is to review work relevant to ultrasonographic examination of the udder of ewes. Udder structures that can be readily imaged ultrasonographically (B-mode or Doppler examination) are mammary parenchyma, the gland cistern, the lactiferous ducts, the mammary vessels, the teat and the supramammary lymph nodes. Conventional diagnostic approaches for mastitis (i.e., combination of clinical, bacteriological and cytological examinations) provide a good means for diagnosis of mastitis; hence, in diagnosis of mastitis, use of ultrasonographic examination has, in general, an ancillary role, for example during investigation of cases, in which clinical diagnosis alone can prove of little help, e.g., in animals with small-sized, deep mammary nodules. The technique can be used at the end of a lactation period as part of routine udder examination performed at that point, which would provide additional useful information, e.g., regarding presence of abcesses or of increased quantity of fibrous tissue. Further, estimation of the dimensions of gland cistern of ewes in a flock would support decisions regarding milking frequency to be applied. Finally, examination of the teat can provide indications regarding optimising use of the milking machine by applying the appropriate settings.  aPublisher supplied data 3aewes 3aflocks 3alactation 3alymph nodes 3amastitis 3amilking frequency 3amilking machines 3audders 3aultrasonography 0aCistern 0aDiagnosis 0aEwe 0aMammary gland 0aMammary parenchyma 0aMastitis 0aMilk yield 0aSheep 0aTeat 0aUltrasonography1 aMavrogianni, V.S.1 aVasileiou, N.G.C.1 aFthenakis, G.C.1 aPetridis, I.G.0 tSmall ruminant research.g2017 July, v. 152 p.86-99dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl44843x0921-44887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.smallrumres.2016.12.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03188naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001500146245009200161300001800253500001900271520156500290592002801855650001301883650003401896650002501930650002601955650002101981650002502002650001802027650001902045650002102064650001902085650003702104650001902141653001902160653002702179653001502206653002302221653002402244653001902268700001702287700005502304700001502359700001402374700005702388773014802445856008002593852000902673655001202682IND60707329220221118205716.0200819e20200730xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070732922DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.0c042782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHao, Yanan10aLuotonin A and Its Derivatives as Novel Antiviral and Antiphytopathogenic Fungus Agents  ap. 8764-8773.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPlant diseases caused by viruses and fungi have posed a serious threat to global agricultural production.

Most compounds displayed better antiviral activities against TMV than commercial ribavirin. Compounds 9k, 12b, and 12d displayed about similar inhibitory effects as ningnanmycin (inhibitory rates of 55, 57, and 59% at 500 μg/mL for inactivation, curative, and protection activities in vivo, respectively), the best antiviral agent at present, and emerged as novel antiviral leads for further research. We selected 9k for further antiviral mechanism research via transmission electron microscopy and molecular docking, which revealed that compound 9k can interact with TMV coat protein through the hydrogen bond, leading to its polymerization, thus preventing virus assembly. Further fungicidal activity tests showed that these compounds also showed broad-spectrum fungicidal activities against 14 kinds of phytopathogenic fungi. Especially, compound 14 with a 100% antifungal effect against Botrytis cinereal emerged as a lead for further research. This work provides a reference for the development of agricultural active ingredients based on Chinese medicine plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBotrytis 3aOriental traditional medicine 3aTobacco mosaic virus 3aantifungal properties 3aantiviral agents 3aantiviral properties 3acoat proteins 3afood chemistry 3ahydrogen bonding 3apolymerization 3atransmission electron microscopy 3avirus assembly 0alead discovery 0astructure optimization 0aluotonin A 0aantiviral activity 0afungicidal activity 0amode of action1 aWang, Kaihua1 aWang, Ziwen1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9798-70211 aLiu, Yuxiu1 aMa, Dejun1 aWang, Qingmin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6062-37660 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2020 July 30, v. 68, no. 33 p.8764-8773dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.0c042783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03716naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245016800164300001400332520202000346592002802366650001902394650000902413650001502422650002602437650001502463650002702478650001302505650001802518650000902536650001902545650001202564650001802576651001002594653000702604653000702611653000802618653000802626653000802634653000702642653000802649653000802657653000702665653003702672653002702709653004102736653001802777700001502795700001802810700001602828700002002844700001202864700001702876700001502893773010302908856008203011852000903093655001203102IND50060294520221121224801.0190403e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006029452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fcr.2012.10.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOtinga, A.N.10aPartial substitution of phosphorus fertiliser by farmyard manure and its localised application increases agronomic efficiency and profitability of maize production  ap. 32-43.  aIn sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), maize production is not only constrained by the limited use of P fertilisers, but also by the strong P fixation (on Fe- and Al-oxides) which consequently lowers the amount of bioavailable P in the soil solution. We hypothesise that substitution of triple super phosphate (TSP) fertiliser with farmyard manure (FYM) and its localised application in the planting row increases the agronomic use efficiency (AE) of the P fertiliser applied.Field experiments were conducted during the 2009 long rains (LRs) and short rains (SRs) at three sites (Sega, Bokoli and Teso) located in western Kenya, to assess (i) the effect of concentrating FYM in different areas of the planting rows, (ii) FYM and TSP applications at different substitution rates and (iii) the effect of FYM and TSP additions and/or their combinations on soil pH, available P, maize yields, AE and economic benefits.Treatments included substituting TSP by FYM at 0, 25, 50, 75 and 100% of the 26kgPha−1 recommended rate. Further, 13kgPha−1 FYM was either applied to 100% of planting area (i.e. broadcast) or localised in only 50% or 25%, of the planting area of the maize row. Results show that FYM and TSP combinations increased maize grain yields by over 200% in Sega, 90–150% in Teso and 20–50% in Bokoli relative to the control. The AE largely depended on the relative fertility of the soils but increased with an increase in FYM in the substitutions. Soil pH and available P were improved by FYM applications only in the second season (2009 SRs). Maximising P from FYM in the substitutions increased net benefits by over 33% with gross benefit cost ratios>4.5$$−1 relative to sole TSP application at 26kgPha−1. Concentrating FYM in 25% of the planting area gave over 32% increases in net benefits relative to broadcast. This study confirms that it is possible to reduce the quantity of FYM if it is applied only in the planting row but its profitability largely depends on the quality of the material selected.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal manures 3acorn 3acrop yield 3afield experimentation 3aphosphates 3aphosphorus fertilizers 3aplanting 3aprofitability 3arain 3asoil fertility 3asoil pH 3asoil solution 3aKenya 0aAE 0aDM 0aFYM 0aLRs 0aMRR 0aNB 0aSRs 0aSSA 0aTC 0aInorganic and organic amendments 0aTriple super phosphate 0aIntegrated soil fertility management 0aPlanting rows1 aPypers, P.1 aOkalebo, J.R.1 aNjoroge, R.1 aEmong’ole, M.1 aSix, L.1 aVanlauwe, B.1 aMerckx, R.0 tField crops research.g2013 Jan., v. 140 p.32-43dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl10215x0378-42907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fcr.2012.10.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03522naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245010200172300001600274520165300290592002801943650001101971650001801982650001402000650001002014650002802024650001802052650001402070650002202084650002002106651001602126651001002142651001902152653003302171653001602204653001402220653001402234653003102248653002202279700002802301700001802329700001802347700002002365700001902385700001902404700001602423700002402439700001702463700002202480700001702502700002802519700001802547700002002565700002502585700002002610700002802630700001802658773010302676856008402779852000902863655001202872IND60609247220221123005627.0180822e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060924722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2017.02.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZijlema, Wilma L.14aThe relationship between natural outdoor environments and cognitive functioning and its mediators  ap. 268-275.  aUrban residents may experience cognitive fatigue and little opportunity for mental restoration due to a lack of access to nature. Natural outdoor environments (NOE) are thought to be beneficial for cognitive functioning, but underlying mechanisms are not clear.To investigate the long-term association between NOE and cognitive function, and its potential mediators.This cross-sectional study was based on adult participants of the Positive Health Effects of the Natural Outdoor Environment in Typical Populations in Different Regions in Europe (PHENOTYPE) project. Data were collected in Barcelona, Spain; Doetinchem, the Netherlands; and Stoke-on-Trent, United Kingdom. We assessed residential distance to NOE, residential surrounding greenness, perceived amount of neighborhood NOE, and engagement with NOE. Cognitive function was assessed with the Color Trails Test (CTT). Mediation analysis was undertaken following Baron and Kenny.Each 100m increase in residential distance to NOE was associated with a longer CTT completion time of 1.50% (95% CI 0.13, 2.89). No associations were found for other NOE indicators and cognitive function. Neighborhood social cohesion was (marginally) significantly associated with both residential distance to NOE and CTT completion time, but no evidence for mediation was found. Nor were there indications for mediation by physical activity, social interaction with neighbors, loneliness, mental health, air pollution worries, or noise annoyance.Our findings provide some indication that proximity to nature may benefit cognitive function. We could not establish which mechanisms may explain this relationship.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aair pollution 3acognition 3acolor 3across-sectional studies 3amental health 3aphenotype 3aphysical activity 3asocial cohesion 3aNetherlands 3aSpain 3aUnited Kingdom 0aNatural outdoor environments 0aGreen space 0aCognition 0aMediation 0aEnvironmental epidemiology 0aBuilt environment1 aTriguero-Mas, Margarita1 aSmith, Graham1 aCirach, Marta1 aMartinez, David1 aDadvand, Payam1 aGascon, Mireia1 aJones, Marc1 aGidlow, Christopher1 aHurst, Gemma1 aMasterson, Daniel1 aEllis, Naomi1 avan den Berg, Magdalena1 aMaas, Jolanda1 avan Kamp, Irene1 avan den Hazel, Peter1 aKruize, Hanneke1 aNieuwenhuijsen, Mark J.1 aJulvez, Jordi0 tEnvironmental research.g2017 May, v. 155 p.268-275dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12442x0013-93517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2017.02.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03145naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002800166245015800194300001800352520157600370592002801946650004701974650003002021650001302051650001102064650002302075650001002098650002102108650001202129650001202141650001302153650001702166650003702183650001302220651001302233651001802246653001802264653001702282653002002299653001702319700001602336700002702352700001802379700002102397773013002418856008202548852000902630655001202639IND60517490920221122093945.0190803e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051749092DNAL7 a262283802pmid7 a10.1017/S13689800150021902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFernandez, Melissa Anne10aDrastic increases in overweight and obesity from 1981 to 2010 and related risk factors: results from the Barbados Children’s Health and Nutrition Study  ap. 3070-3077.  aTo examine overweight and obesity (OWOB), changes in prevalence and potential risk factors in Barbadian children. A cross-section of students were weighed and measured. The WHO BMI-for-age growth references (BAZ), the International Obesity Task Force cut-offs and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention growth percentiles were used to determine OWOB prevalence. Harvard weight-for-height-for-age growth standards were used to estimate differences in OWOB prevalence from 1981 to 2010. Samples of parents and students were interviewed to describe correlates of OWOB. Barbados. Public-school students (n 580) in class 3. Based on WHO BAZ, the overall prevalence of OWOB was 34·8 % (95 % CI 30·9, 38·7 %). A trend of higher OWOB prevalence was seen for girls across cut-offs, with significant sex differences noted using the International Obesity Task Force cut-offs. According to Harvard growth standards, OWOB has increased dramatically, from 8·52 % to 32·5 %. Children were more likely to be OWOB when annual household income was below BBD 9000 (OR=2·69; 95 % CI 1·21, 5·99). Eating dinner with the family every night was associated with a lower prevalence of OWOB (OR=0·56; 95 % CI 0·36, 0·87). The sharp increase of OWOB rates in Barbados warrants attention. Sex disparities in OWOB prevalence may emerge at a young age. Promoting family meals may be a feasible option for OWOB prevention. Understanding familial and sociodemographic factors influencing OWOB will be useful in planning successful intervention or prevention programmes in Barbados.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCenters for Disease Control and Prevention 3aWorld Health Organization 3achildren 3adinner 3agender differences 3agirls 3ahousehold income 3aobesity 3aparents 3aplanning 3arisk factors 3asociodemographic characteristics 3astudents 3aBarbados 3aUnited States 0aChild obesity 0aRisk factors 0aSex differences 0aFamily meals1 aKubow, Stan1 aGray-Donald, Katherine1 aKnight, JaDon1 aGaskin, Pamela S0 tPublic health nutrition.g2015 Dec., v. 18, no. 17 p.3070-3077dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl56775x1475-27277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S13689800150021903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03084naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002700150245008400177300001400261520171100275592002801986650001902014650002102033650001902054650002002073650001402093650002102107650001402128650000902142650002202151650003102173650000902204650001602213650001502229653001902244653001402263653001802277653003402295653001802329653002602347700002702373700001902400773010202419856008402521852000902605655001202614IND60609247320221123005804.0180822e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060924732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2016.11.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIslam, Muhammad Saiful10aTowards a threshold climate for emergency lower respiratory hospital admissions  ap. 41-47.  aIdentification of ‘cut-points’ or thresholds of climate factors would play a crucial role in alerting risks of climate change and providing guidance to policymakers. This study investigated a ‘Climate Threshold’ for emergency hospital admissions of chronic lower respiratory diseases by using a distributed lag non-linear model (DLNM). We analysed a unique longitudinal dataset (10 years, 2000–2009) on emergency hospital admissions, climate, and pollution factors for the Greater London. Our study extends existing work on this topic by considering non-linearity, lag effects between climate factors and disease exposure within the DLNM model considering B-spline as smoothing technique. The final model also considered natural cubic splines of time since exposure and ‘day of the week’ as confounding factors. The results of DLNM indicated a significant improvement in model fitting compared to a typical GLM model. The final model identified the thresholds of several climate factors including: high temperature (≥27°C), low relative humidity (≤ 40%), high Pm10 level (≥70-µg/m³), low wind speed (≤ 2 knots) and high rainfall (≥30mm). Beyond the threshold values, a significantly higher number of emergency admissions due to lower respiratory problems would be expected within the following 2–3 days after the climate shift in the Greater London. The approach will be useful to initiate ‘region and disease specific’ climate mitigation plans. It will help identify spatial hot spots and the most sensitive areas and population due to climate change, and will eventually lead towards a diversified health warning system tailored to specific climate zones and populations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3aclimatic factors 3aclimatic zones 3adata collection 3ahospitals 3anonlinear models 3apollution 3arain 3arelative humidity 3arespiratory tract diseases 3arisk 3atemperature 3awind speed 0aClimate Change 0aThreshold 0aDelayed model 0aEmergency hospital admissions 0aAir pollution 0aHealth warning System1 aChaussalet, Thierry J.1 aKoizumi, Naoru0 tEnvironmental research.g2017 Feb., v. 153 p.41-47dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12442x0013-93517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2016.11.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02591naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100002300156245013600179300001600315520156800331592002801899650001201927650001201939650001301951650001501964650002601979650001102005650001202016650002102028650001602049651001302065773010902078856005702187852000902244655001202253IND50065202520221119105211.0130416e200106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006520252DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1654-109X.2001.tb00240.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLarge, Andrew R.G.10aReversing spontaneous succession to protect high‐value vegetation: Assessment of two Scottish mires using rapid survey techniques  ap. 103-110.  aDespite existing management agreements, significant change has occurred on Carnwath Moss and Coladoir Bog, two mire complexes in central and western Scotland. Spontaneous succession has accelerated, resulting in extensive degradation of the mire vegetation on both sites and, in particular, widespread expansion of Calluna vulgaris‐ and Molinia caerulea‐dominated vegetation types. Vegetation surveys across strong gradients of change were conducted with the aim of quantifying the extent of early (desirable) and late (undesirable) successional vegetation on both sites. For each site multivariate analyses of the vegetation data were carried out using TWINSPAN, which clearly differentiated higher quality and degraded surfaces. In management terms percentage Sphagnum cover can act as a useful proxy measure of water level and shrub layer height can also serve as a useful indicator of the degree of degradation. A broad‐based, five class condition continuum was developed for the Carnwath Moss site. While such an assessment scheme is a somewhat arbitrary means of allocating mesotope areas to specific condition classes, it is rapid to apply and simple enough to be applied by a range of users. A drawback is that the methodology is data‐light in temporal terms and is not a long‐term substitute for properly‐funded monitoring programmes for important sites. For both mires, recommendations are made for management with the main emphasis being on maintaining water tables at appropriate levels to maximise the floristic diversity of active mires.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCalluna 3aMolinia 3aSphagnum 3amonitoring 3amultivariate analysis 3ashrubs 3asurveys 3avegetation types 3awater table 3aScotland0 tApplied vegetation science.g2001 June, v. 4, no. 1 p.103-110dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1402-20017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1654-109X.2001.tb00240.x  aDNAL 7aarticle03171naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004600094040001800140100002500158245007700183300001400260520167100274592002801945650001901973650001301992650003002005650001902035650002102054650001502075650001002090650001502100650001102115650001102126650001302137650001402150650001602164651001502180653003202195653002602227653003402253653002302287653002002310700001702330700001902347700002302366773019902389856009202588852000902680655001202689IND60682482820221121104419.0200128e20200127xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068248282DNAL7 a10.5814/j.issn.1674-764x.2020.01.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalas, Eric Ariel L.10aResponse of Asiatic Ibex (Capra sibirica) under Climate Change Scenarios  ap. 27-37.  aWe investigated the effects of climate change on the distribution of the Asiatic ibex (Capra sibirica) in eastern Tajikistan. No existing climate change studies have been conducted on the habitat of a wild goat species in Asia. We conducted ecological niche modelling to compare potential present and future distributions of suitable environmental conditions for ibex. Projecting to 2070, 18% (2689 km²) of the current suitable areas would be lost, mostly located in the southeastern and northwestern regions of the study area. However, new suitable habitats could expand outside the current ibex range —about 30% (4595 km²) expansion until 2070. We found that the elevation, terrain roughness, seasonal temperature, and precipitation of warmest quarter were the most important factors in the models and had strong correlations to ibex distribution. The losses in the southeastern portion overlapped most of the current locations of ibex in that region. These losses were observed in the much lower elevations of the study area (3500 m to 4000 m). When considering both loss and gain, the ibex could see a net expansion to new suitable habitats. About 30% (1379 km²) of the average habitat gains for the Asiatic ibex in 2070 showed a shift to northern lower temperature habitats. Our results are beneficial in planning for the potential effects on biodiversity conservation in the eastern mountain region of Tajikistan under climate change scenarios. Special attention should be given to the ibex populations in the southeastern region, where habitats could become unsuitable for the species as a result of the climate-induced effects on the mountain ecosystem.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCapra sibirica 3aaltitude 3abiodiversity conservation 3aclimate change 3aclimatic factors 3aecosystems 3agoats 3alandscapes 3amodels 3aniches 3aplanning 3aroughness 3atemperature 3aTajikistan 0aensemble forecasting models 0aglobal climate change 0aspecies distribution modeling 0amountain ungulates 0aPamir Mountains1 aValdez, Raul1 aMichel, Stefan1 aBoykin, Kenneth G.0 tJournal of resources and ecology.g2020 Jan. 27, v. 11, no. 1 p.27-37dInstitute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of ScienceswJournal:2202x1674-764X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5814/j.issn.1674-764x.2020.01.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02851naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245012900161300001300290520160100303592002801904650001001932650001301942650002801955650001201983650001001995650001102005650001902016650001702035650002502052650001002077650001302087650001002100650004202110650001802152650001302170650001002183700002002193700002402213773009802237856007302335852000902408655001202417IND60477891220221122223216.0160106e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047789122DNAL7 a10.1111/vop.122402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMancuso, Laura A.10aPorcine urinary bladder extracellular matrix grafts (ACell Vet® Corneal Discs) for keratomalacia in 17 equids (2012–2013)  ap. 3-10.  aOBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical course, outcomes, and complications associated with use of commercially available porcine urinary bladder extracellular matrix (ECM) grafts (ACell Vet® Corneal Discs) in equid patients with keratomalacia, and to evaluate the efficacy of ECM grafts as a viable alternative to other biomaterials for corneal grafting in equid patients. ANIMALS: Sixteen horses and one donkey (17 eyes) with unilateral keratomalacia severe enough to warrant surgical repair between August 2012 and September 2013. PROCEDURE: Retrospective medical record review to identify equid patients meeting inclusion criteria of (i) diagnosis with keratomalacia severe enough to warrant surgical repair and (ii) surgical repair with an extracellular matrix graft. RESULTS: Eleven geldings, four mares, and two colts met inclusion criteria. Patients averaged 9 years of age. Twelve of 17 eyes (71%) were considered infected based on either corneal cytology (10/17, or 59%) or corneal culture (12/17, or 71%) positive for bacteria (8/17, or 47%) or fungi (9/17, or 53%). At the time topical medications were discontinued, 16 eyes (94%) were visual. One operated eye ruptured 5 days postoperatively and was enucleated. Keratouveitis developed in 14/14 eyes that underwent regular examinations approximately 2 weeks postoperatively which responded to systemic nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drug therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Extracellular matrix grafts may be a viable alternative to other biomaterials for corneal grafting in equids. Advantages include commercial availability and shelf storage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aasses 3abacteria 3abiocompatible materials 3abladder 3acolts 3acornea 3adisease course 3adrug therapy 3aextracellular matrix 3afungi 3ageldings 3amares 3anonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents 3aophthalmology 3apatients 3aswine1 aLassaline, Mary1 aScherrer, Nicole M.0 tVeterinary ophthalmology.g2016 Jan., v. 19, no. 1 p.3-10dBlackwell Sciencex1463-52167nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/vop.122403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01188naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001700138245010200155300001800257520021500275592002800490650002300518650001700541650001400558650001100572650002200583700001900605700002200624700001900646773012800665856007200793852000900865655001200874IND60657506620221121081119.0190816e20040428xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065750662DNAL7 a10.1039/b401050g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHermans, Ive10aMechanism of the catalytic oxidation of hydrocarbons by N-hydroxyphthalimide: a theoretical study  ap. 1140-1141.  aThe mechanism of the recently proposed catalytic oxidation of hydrocarbons by oxygen in the presence of N-hydroxyphthalimide (NHPI) was established by quantum chemical calculations, consistent with experiments.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalytic activity 3ahydrocarbons 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3aquantum mechanics1 aVereecken, Luc1 aJacobs, Pierre A.1 aPeeters, Jozef0 tChemical communications.g2004 Apr. 28, , no. 9 p.1140-1141dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b401050g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02847naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005600150245011500206300002000321520139800341592002801739650001501767650001201782650001601794650002601810650002201836650001201858650001201870650001101882650001901893700001601912700001701928700002301945700001601968700002301984700002102007700006402028700005102092700006102143773011602204856008402320852000902404655001202413IND60624613220221119055707.0181204e20181107xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062461322DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.8b030852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Zhijie1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9232-738210aEnhanced Separation of Butane Isomers via Defect Control in a Fumarate/Zirconium-Based Metal Organic Framework  ap. 14546-14551.  aThe discovery of appropriate synthetic reaction conditions for fabricating a stable zirconium-based molecular sieve (Zr-fum-fcu-MOF) with minimal defects and its utilization in the challenging separation of linear paraffins from branched paraffins is reported. The crystallinity and structural defects were modulated and adjusted at the molecular level by controlling the synthetic reaction conditions (i.e., amounts of modulators and ligands). The impact of molecular defects on the separation of n-butane from iso-butane was studied through the preparation, fine characterization, and performance evaluation of Zr-fum-fcu-MOFs with varying degrees of defects. Defect-rich Zr-fum-fcu-MOFs were found to have poor n-butane/iso-butane separation, mainly driven by thermodynamics, while Zr-fum-fcu-MOFs with fewer or minimal defects showed efficient separation, driven mainly by kinetics and full molecular exclusion mechanisms. The impact of intrinsic defects (i.e., missing organic or inorganic blocks) on the associated mechanisms involved in the separation of n-butane/iso-butane was evidenced through single-gas adsorption, mixed-gas column breakthrough experiments, and calorimetric studies. This investigation demonstrates, for the first time, the importance of controlling intrinsic defects to maintain the selective exclusion behavior of hydrocarbon isomers when using molecular sieves.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3abutanes 3acalorimetry 3acoordination polymers 3acrystal structure 3aisomers 3aligands 3asieves 3athermodynamics1 aFeng, Liang1 aLiu, Lingmei1 aBhatt, Prashant M.1 aAdil, Karim1 aEmwas, Abdul-Hamid1 aAssen, Ayalew H.1 aBelmabkhout, Youssef1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9952-50071 aHan, Yu1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1462-11181 aEddaoudi, Mohamed1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1916-98370 tLangmuir.g2018 Nov. 07, v. 34, no. 48 p.14546-14551dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19170x1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.8b030853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03196naa a2200361 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100002000115245008900135300001400224520214900238592002802387650002202415650001602437650002402453650002002477650001502497650002202512650001502534650002002549651001302569700002102582700001802603700001902621700002002640773010702660852000902767939003302776946001302809655001202822991568375360742620221119185604.0181002e198707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aADL870976692DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCRABTREE, R.

This is especially true for summer crops, whether grown in mono- or double-cropping situations, for these factors have a significant impact on yields and profitability. This study was conducted at the Oklahoma Vegetable Research Station, Bixby, Oklahoma, from 1980–1984 on a Wynona silt loam soil (Cumulic Hapla-quolls) with 0–1% slope. The objectives were to compare yields and net economic returns of mono- and double-cropped wheat [Triticum aestivum (L.) EM. Thell] and soybeans [Glycine max (L.) Merr.], where all wheat was produced under rain-fed conditions and where mono- and double-cropped soybeans were produced under both rain-fed and irrigated conditions. Over the 5-year period, rain-fed monocropped wheat yielded an average of 3498, compared with 3008 and 2948 kg ha for rain-fed, double-cropped wheat following irrigated and rain-fed double-cropped soybeans, respectively. Irrigated, conventionally tilled monocropped soybeans yielded an average of 2800 compared with 2162 kg ha for rain-fed, conventionally tilled monocropped soybeans. Irrigated, no-till, double-cropped soybeans yielded an average of 2072 compared with 1546 kg ha for rain-fed, no-till, double-cropped soybeans. Rain-fed double-cropped wheat and rain-fed, no-till, double-cropped soybeans produced the highest net economic return ($317 ha) of any of the five cropping systems. Net returns from rain-fed, double-cropped wheat and irrigated, no-till, double-cropped soybeans; rain-fed mono-cropped wheat; and rain-fed, conventionally tilled, monocropped soybeans were similar and ranged from $246, $238, and $233 ha, respectively. Irrigated, conventionally tilled, monocropped soybeans returned $183 ha. Irrigation increased the yields of mono- and double-cropped soybeans 638 and 526 kg ha, respectively. However, given these yields, the price of soybeans would have to increase from $0.25 kg to $0.31 and $0.40 kg, respectively, for mono- and double-cropped soybeans before irrigation would become economically feasible.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTriticum aestivum 3aGlycine max 3acontinuous cropping 3adouble cropping 3acrop yield 3acosts and returns 3airrigation 3adryland farming 3aOklahoma1 aGREENLAND, R.

The method has evolved to deal with heteroscedastic data and fixed or proportional biases (or both). Although an ordinary Bland-Altman plot can be readily made with various software applications, there is no free, open-source application that is dedicated to producing Bland-Altman plots and constructing limits of agreement for data that do not meet the assumptions of a simple comparison. To fill this gap, we created BA-plotteR, a web-based, open-source, freeware tool created in Shiny/R that is dedicated to creating Bland-Altman plots. We validated the tool using 20 datasets with various data distributions by comparing the output from the tool against manually derived results. The webtool handles data that requires a more complex analysis than is commonly available through commercial statistical programs. Moreover, the automated analysis of the data distribution will guide users and help them to correctly plot and analyse their data. The tool agreed perfectly with manually constructed plots. The Bland-Altman graphing tool provides clinical researchers with a tool that correctly analyzes and graphs studies involved in method comparisons.

In particular, little is known about the intentional nature of monkeys' gestural signalling and related social understanding. We investigated whether olive baboons can (1) adjust their requesting gestures to the visual attention of the experimenter with special emphasis on the state of the eyes (open versus closed), and (2) flexibly tailor visual and auditory-based gestures to elaborate their communication as a function of whether or not the experimenter can see them. Using a food-requesting paradigm, we found monkeys able to favour either visual or auditory-based requesting gestures to match the experimenter's visual attention. Crucially, when the human was not visually attending, they silenced visual gestures to some extent but performed more attention-getting gestures. This is, to our knowledge, the first report of monkeys elaborating attention-getting signals to compensate for communication breakdown. Gestural communication was also supported by gaze alternation between the experimenter's face and the food, especially when the human was visually attending. These findings offer evidence that olive baboons understand the state of the eyes in others' visual attention and use requesting gestures intentionally. They emphasize that Old World monkeys shift to acoustic communication when the recipient is not visually attending. In contrast to that of human infants and great apes, this acoustic communication is purely gestural, not vocal.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPapio anubis 3aPongidae 3aanimal behavior 3abioacoustics 3aeyes 3aface 3ahumans 3ainfants 3amonkeys 0aaudience attention 0agestural communication 0aintentionality 0alanguage 0anonhuman primate1 aMeguerditchian, Adrien1 aMaille, Audrey1 aGaunet, Florence1 aVauclair, Jacques0 tAnimal behaviour.g2014 Jan., v. 87 p.121-128dElsevier LtdaThe Association for the Study of Animal BehaviourwJournal:jnl45841x0003-34727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2013.10.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01418naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005700094040001800151100003300169245010600202300001600308520045800324592002800782653002100810653001500831653001400846653002400860700001500884773011500899856011701014852000901131655001201140IND60124954620221116233848.0151101e200009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012495462DNAL7 a10.1636/0161-8202(2000)028[0180:EOFTET]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHerberstein, Marie Elisabeth10aEvaluation of formulae to estimate the capture area and mesh height of orb webs (araneoidea, araneae)  ap. 180-184.  aWe evaluated several formulae to estimate the capture area (the area of the web covered by capture spirals) and the mesh height (the distance between capture spirals) of orb webs constructed by Argiope keyserlingi Karsch.

Protein precipitation with acetonitrile was selected for sample preparation method based on recovery and matrix effect. The chromatographic separation of the sample was performed on a reverse-phase AQ column with an isocratic mobile phase consisting of 10 mM ammonium acetate (pH 4.0) and acetonitrile (50:50, v/v). The analyte was quantified by multiple reaction monitoring with a Waters Quattro micro™ API mass spectrometer. The lower limits of quantification were 20 ng/mL in plasma and 2 ng/g in brain, with the relative standard deviation % of 7.6 and 8.0% for plasma and brain samples, respectively. Acceptable intra-day and inter-day precisions and accuracies were obtained. Otaplimastat was sufficiently stable under all relevant analytical conditions, including a temperature of 4°C for 24 hr, room temperature 20°C for 24 hr, −80°C for 10 days and three freeze-thaw cycles (each at −80°C for 24 hr), for rat plasma and brain tissue. The validated method was successfully used to measure Otaplimastat concentrations in rat plasma and brain samples.  aPublisher supplied data  cKorea Health Technology R&D  cKorea Health Industry Development Institutedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100003710  aHI15C2796cMinistry of Health & Welfare, Republic of Korea 3aacetonitrile 3aambient temperature 3aammonium acetate 3ablood plasma 3abrain 3afreeze-thaw cycles 3aliquid chromatography 3apH 3arats 3aspectrometers 3astandard deviation 3atandem mass spectrometry1 aKim, Miri1 aOh, Ju-Hee1 aLee, Joo Hyun1 aShin, Naree1 aPark, Taehoon1 aLee, Ji-hyeon,1 aKim, Min Chang1 aYi, Yŏng-ju,0 tJournal of chromatographic science.g2019 Mar. 01, v. 57, no. 3 p.258-264dOxford University PresswJournal:18439x1945-239X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/chromsci/bmy1093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03790naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001100151245014300162506011700305506007600422520189300498592002802391506003702419650001602456650003102472650001802503650001102521650001902532650001902551650004002570650001602610650001502626650002302641650001702664651001002681653001702691653002302708653004102731653003602772700001702808700002002825700001802845700001402863700001302877700001902890700001702909700001802926700001902944700001802963700001502981700002002996773010103016856008603117852000903203655001203212IND60775593320221207120925.0220704e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077559332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2022.1089052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Li10aAnalysis on the relationship between sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence and gross primary productivity of winter wheat in northern China  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) is directly related to the photosynthesis of winter wheat and has a good linear relationship with the gross primary production (GPP). However, the relationship of SIF and GPP is still uncertain under different soil water content conditions. The sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence, GPP and non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) are the three ways of photosynthetically active radiation in plants. The photochemical reflectance index (PRI) can be used as a proxy indicator of NPQ to characterize the change in heat dissipation during photosynthesis process of winter wheat. To detect the impact of soil water content on winter wheat photosynthesis and SIF and GPP relationship, based on the ground measurement data at Zhaoxian Experimental Station in northern China during the growing season in 2018 and the simulated data by the SCOPE model, we use PRI to improve the GPP model estimated by SIF. The results indicate that: (1) PRI is sensitive to soil water content (R² = 0.64), so it can be used to improve the estimation of GPP based on SIF under different soil water conditions; (2) For the ground measurement data, PRIₒbᵥ can improve the estimation accuracy of GPPₒbᵥ by SIFₒbᵥ. Under different soil water content (SWC) conditions, the relationship between GPPₒbᵥ and SIFₒbᵥ is significantly correlated (R² = 0.33–0.45, p < 0.01), and PRIₒbᵥ can be used to improve the estimation between GPPₒbᵥ and SIFₒbᵥ (R² = 0.57–0.62, p < 0.01); (3) The simulation results of the SCOPE model show that the simulation effect of the model can be better optimized by adding PRI under the condition of relatively dry soil (△R² = 0.13–0.17). Our research suggests that PRI can be added when estimating GPP using SIF information, especially when winter wheat is under low soil water content conditions.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3achlorophyll 3agross primary productivity 3aheat transfer 3amodels 3aphotochemistry 3aphotosynthesis 3aphotosynthetically active radiation 3areflectance 3asoil water 3asoil water content 3awinter wheat 3aChina 0aWinter wheat 0aSoil water content 0aSun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence 0aPhotochemical reflectance index1 aSun, Leigang1 aWang, Shaoqiang1 aChen, Jinghua1 aChen, Bin1 aZhu, Kai1 aAmir, Muhammad1 aWang, Xiaobo1 aLiu, Yuanyuan1 aWang, Pengyuan1 aWang, Junbang1 aHuang, Mei1 aWang, Zhaosheng0 tEcological indicators.g2022 June, v. 139 p.108905-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2022.1089053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02127naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100001700189245008300206300001600289506007600305520081000381592002801191506003701219650001801256650001801274650001301292650001201305653002401317653002301341653002701364653002201391653002301413653002601436700002101462700001701483773012601500856008201626852000901708655001201717IND60554816020221207124508.0180905s2016    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055481602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.csbj.2016.08.0022doi7 aPMC50180632pmcid7 a276425032pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGroß, Anika10aEvolution of biomedical ontologies and mappings: Overview of recent approaches  ap. 333-340.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBiomedical ontologies are heavily used to annotate data, and different ontologies are often interlinked by ontology mappings. These ontology-based mappings and annotations are used in many applications and analysis tasks. Since biomedical ontologies are continuously updated dependent artifacts can become outdated and need to undergo evolution as well. Hence there is a need for largely automated approaches to keep ontology-based mappings up-to-date in the presence of evolving ontologies. In this article, we survey current approaches and novel directions in the context of ontology and mapping evolution. We will discuss requirements for mapping adaptation and provide a comprehensive overview on existing approaches. We will further identify open challenges and outline ideas for future developments.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abiotechnology 3adata analysis 3amedicine 3asurveys 0aBiomedical ontology 0aOntology evolution 0aOntology-based mapping 0aMapping evolution 0aMapping adaptation 0aBiomedical annotation1 aPruski, Cédric,1 aRahm, Erhard0 tComputational and Structural Biotechnology Journal.g2016, v. 14 p.333-340dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23199x2001-03707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.csbj.2016.08.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02427naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245011900166300001400285500001500299520102900314592002801343650004301371650002701414650001201441650001701453650001601470650001301486650000801499650001401507650001401521650002001535650001501555650002401570650002001594650001801614650001401632653001601646653001601662700001801678700001901696700001201715700001701727700001201744773012001756856004801876852000901924655001201933IND50062664520221118124539.0130322e201302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006266452DNAL7 a10.1007/s11783-012-0455-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Huining10aDetecting Cryptosporidium parvum and Giardia lamblia by coagulation concentration and real-time PCR quantification  ap. 49-54.  a2019-12-04  aRapid and sensitive pathogen detection methods are essential for the effective functioning of the water treatment industry, yet for many pathogens, effective detection and removal methods are still lacking. Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts and Giardia lamblia cysts are two of the most common waterborne pathogens currently infecting the water supply. In this study, a new method was developed for the detection of Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts and Giardia lamblia cysts. The method includes multi-steps as coagulation concentration of (oo)cysts in water, the dissolution of the resulting flocs into a small volume using acid, filtration of the (oo)cysts solution, and DNA extraction, purification, and examination using real-time PCR. The method was tested using spiked tap water and reservoir water as references, and the mean recovery ranged from 19.6% to 97.6% for oocysts, and from 51.4% to 98.7% for cysts. The method is economical and convenient, and is especially suitable for relatively high turbidity surface water.  aPublisher supplied data 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aCryptosporidium parvum 3aoocysts 3awater supply 3acoagulation 3aindustry 3aDNA 3aturbidity 3atap water 3awater treatment 3afiltration 3amicrobial detection 3aGiardia lamblia 3asurface water 3apathogens 0amethodology 0anew methods1 aZhang, Xiaohu1 aZhang, Shuting1 aWei, Bo1 aJiang, Qipei1 aYu, Xin0 tFrontiers of environmental science & engineering.g2013 Feb., v. 7, no. 1 p.49-54dSpringer-Verlagx2095-22017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11783-012-0455-2  aDNAL 7aarticle03341naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245010500173506011700278506007600395520170600471592002802177506003702205650001902242650001902261650002002280650002302300650002202323650001802345650003002363650002902393650002802422650002202450653001902472653002102491653001802512653000802530653001502538653002702553700002002580700001802600700002302618700002202641773010102663856008602764852000902850655001202859IND60775593420221207120926.0220704e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077559342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2022.1089122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMagazzino, Cosimo10aRenewable energy consumption, environmental degradation and economic growth: the greener the richer?  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aClimate change presents the greatest challenge facing all countries of the world in the new millennium. Among others, objective 13 of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) aims at adopting urgent measures to contrast climate change and its consequences. Part of the decline in the global growth of emissions has been the increase in using renewable energies. In this context, the relationship among GDP, CO₂ emissions, and renewable energy use has been investigated in this study, starting from a systematic review that has noticed the presence of three clusters focused on: CO2 emissions, GDP, and energy consumption. Despite the current level of interest in examining the relationship among these variables, there have been few empirical studies. To fill this knowledge gap, this paper has been focused on the Scandinavian countries, where the use of renewable energies has steadily increased, developing novel panel analysis estimates. Using a dataset of these five economies over a 1990–2018 time period, several panel data tests have been carried out, in order to robustly assess the causality issue among renewable energies, CO₂ emissions, and GDP. The results of the empirical analysis imply that renewable energy consumption is a useful policy instrument to reduce CO₂ emissions without adversely affecting GDP growth. The main implications have been that the decrease of CO₂ emissions, by increasing renewable energy use, can guarantee high levels of energy efficiency and economic growth. These empirical findings help design innovative energy policy roadmaps and accelerate the ecological transition through the promotion of renewable energy and the reduction of GHG emissions.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate change 3adata collection 3aempirical research 3aenergy efficiency 3aenergy policy 3aenvironmental degradation 3arenewable energy sources 3asustainable development 3asystematic review 0aSustainability 0aRenewable energy 0aCO2 emissions 0aGDP 0aPanel data 0aScandinavian countries1 aToma, Pierluigi1 aFusco, Giulio1 aValente, Donatella1 aPetrosillo, Irene0 tEcological indicators.g2022 June, v. 139 p.108912-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2022.1089123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03099naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100002200192245010100214300001600315506007600331520151500407592002801922506003701950650002001987650001502007650002002022650001202042650001902054650002502073651001302098653001502111653001502126653001302141653003502154653002502189653001402214653001902228700001902247700001802266700002802284700002602312700002202338773015002360856008602510852000902596655001202605IND60532242120221207072740.0190214e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053224212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anbehav.2013.10.0232doi7 aPMC38900962pmcid7 a244364952pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiller, Jordan A.10aCompeting for space: female chimpanzees are more aggressive inside than outside their core areas  ap. 147-152.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aFemale space use can have important fitness consequences, which are likely due to differential access to food resources. Many studies have explored spatial competition in solitary species, but little is known about how individuals in social species compete over shared space. In this study, we investigate spatial patterns of aggression among female East African chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii. This species provides an excellent opportunity to study spatial competition since (1) female chimpanzees occupy overlapping core areas (small areas of the community range in which individuals concentrate their space use) and (2) female core area quality is correlated with reproductive success, suggesting that females compete over long-term access to core areas. Here, we examine how female aggression towards other females varies inside and outside individual female core areas during a 14-year period at Gombe National Park, Tanzania. Overall, females showed higher rates of aggression inside than outside their own core areas. This pattern was driven by spatial variation in aggression in nonfeeding contexts. While food-related aggression did not vary spatially, females were more aggressive in nonfeeding contexts inside their core areas than they were outside their core areas. These results suggest that female chimpanzees follow a mixed strategy in which they compete for long-term access to resources in their core areas as well as for immediate access to food throughout the community range.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPan troglodytes 3aaggression 3aanimal behavior 3afemales 3anational parks 3areproductive success 3aTanzania 0aaggression 0achimpanzee 0aforaging 0aPan troglodytes schweinfurthii 0aresource competition 0aspace use 0aterritoriality1 aPusey, Anne E.1 aGilby, Ian C.1 aSchroepfer-Walker, Kara1 aCatherine Markham, A.1 aMurray, Carson M.0 tAnimal behaviour.g2014 Jan., v. 87 p.147-152dElsevier LtdaThe Association for the Study of Animal BehaviourwJournal:jnl45841x0003-34727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2013.10.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02957naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002700151245008600178300001300264520168500277592002801962650002001990650001402010650000902024650001102033650001902044650001602063653001402079653001802093653001902111653002102130653001102151653001702162653002002179700002002199700003202219700001902251700002302270773014702293856008602440852000902526655001202535IND60532242220221119084400.0190214e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053224222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anbehav.2013.10.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDavidson, Gabrielle L.10aGaze sensitivity: function and mechanisms from sensory and cognitive perspectives  ap. 3-15.  aSensitivity to the gaze of other individuals has long been a primary focus in sociocognitive research on humans and other animals. Information about where others are looking may often be of adaptive value in social interactions and predator avoidance, but studies across a range of taxa indicate there are substantial differences in the extent to which animals obtain and use information about other individuals' gaze direction. As the literature expands, it is becoming increasingly difficult to make comparisons across taxa as experiments adopt and adjust different methodologies to account for differences between species in their socioecology, sensory systems and possibly also their underlying cognitive mechanisms. Furthermore, as more species are found to exhibit gaze sensitivity, more terminology arises to describe the behaviours. To clarify the field, we propose a restricted nomenclature that defines gaze sensitivity in terms of observable behaviour, independent of the underlying mechanisms. This is particularly useful in nonhuman animal studies where cognitive interpretations are ambiguous. We then describe how socioecological factors may influence whether species will attend to gaze cues, and suggest links between ultimate factors and proximate mechanisms such as cognition and perception. In particular, we argue that variation in sensory systems, such as retinal specializations and the position of the eyes, will determine whether gaze cues (e.g. head movement) are perceivable during visual fixation. We end by making methodological recommendations on how to apply these variations in socioecology and visual systems to advance the field of gaze research.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal behavior 3acognition 3aeyes 3ahumans 3asocial benefit 3aterminology 0acognition 0agaze aversion 0agaze following 0agaze sensitivity 0aretina 0avisual field 0avisual fixation1 aButler, Shannon1 aFernández-Juricic, Esteban1 aThornton, Alex1 aClayton, Nicola S.0 tAnimal behaviour.g2014 Jan., v. 87 p.3-15dElsevier LtdaThe Association for the Study of Animal BehaviourwJournal:jnl45841x0003-34727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2013.10.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03004naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001400152245009900166500001400265520143500279592002801714650003001742650001601772650001201788650001601800650002201816650001401838650001601852650000901868650000901877650001001886650001301896650001501909650001201924650001501936650001201951650001901963653001501982653002501997653001802022653002902040653003002069700005402099700001202153700001602165700001502181700005202196773013002248856008702378852000902465655001202474IND60696984020221122223648.0200621e20200801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069698402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2020.1130052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQian, Gao10aExperimental investigation of a U-tube thermocell under various Fe(CN)63−/4− concentration  aNAL-light  aResearch interest in thermocell technology has been increasingly occurring due to its large Seebeck coefficient (~1 mV/K) and flexible structure, which are its unique advantages for use in wearable devices directly converting thermal energy into electricity. It is timely and critical to investigate the technology to potentially overcome the technological drawbacks of thermocell such as its relatively low power density and limited overall energy efficiency. In this paper, the correlation between the performance of a Fe(CN)₆³⁻/⁴⁻ thermocell and ion concentrations are studied through factorial experiments. Solubility tests are conducted to obtain the maximum concentration. Activity coefficient is found non-negligible in the Nernst equation. The saturation line calculated through concentration solubility product shows relatively close agreement with experimental results. Total concentration, as well as the concentration ratio of ions, have a significant effect on the thermocell performance. At the optimised concentration point on the saturation line, power density, Seebeck coefficient and efficiency respectively increase by 7.38%, 8.93% and 5.69%. And the mass of solute decreases by 12.64%, compared with the widely used 1:1 concentration ratio. Results demonstrate to improve the power density of thermocell, the solution needs to be saturated and the ion concentration ratio should be taken into account.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadministrative management 3acorrelation 3adensity 3aelectricity 3aenergy efficiency 3aequations 3aexhibitions 3aions 3amass 3apaper 3aresearch 3asolubility 3asolutes 3atechnology 3atesting 3athermal energy 0aThermocell 0aFactorial experiment 0aConcentration 0aPerformance optimisation 0aThermal energy conversion1 aYu, Xiaoli1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1846-74881 aLi, Zhi1 aWu, Jiarong1 aHuang, Rui1 aLu, Yiji1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5552-38940 tEnergy conversion and management.g2020 Aug. 01, v. 217 p.113005-dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2020.1130053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02650naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001900145245017300164300001600337520128700353592002801640650001601668650001401684650002101698650001301719650001801732650002901750650001701779650002201796650001501818650001301833650005801846650001501904650003001919700002601949700002101975700002101996773013502017856007902152852000902231655001202240IND60673268120221122062112.0191018e20190401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067326812DNAL7 a10.1093/chromsci/bmy1122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMerey, Hanan A10aValidated Chromatographic Methods for Simultaneous Determination of Calcipotriol Monohydrate and Betamethasone Dipropionate in the Presence of Two Dosage Form Additives  ap. 305-311.  aTwo chromatographic methods were developed, optimized and validated for simultaneous determination of calcipotriol monohydrate (CPM) and betamethasone dipropionate (BMD) in the presence of two dosage form additives named; butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) and alpha-tocopherol (TOCO). The proposed methods were accurate, sensitive and specific. The first method based on using aluminum thin-layer chromatographic plates precoated with silica gel GF₂₅₄ as a stationary phase and chloroform–ethyl acetate–toluene (5:5:3, by volume) as a developing system. This was followed by densitometric measurement of the separated bands at 264 nm. Whereas the second method is RP-HPLC where OnyxMonolithic C₁₈® column was used with a gradient profile using methanol, water and acetic acid at flow rate 2.0 mL min⁻¹. Detection was carried out at 264 nm. The methods were validated according to ICH guidelines. The specificity of the developed methods was investigated by analyzing the pharmaceutical dosage form. The validity of the proposed methods was assessed using the standard addition technique.

Seeking to comply with a more sustainable future of mobility, the purpose of the present work is to study the impacts of exhaust gas recirculation, combined with changes in the in-cylinder primary flow structure, in the experimental operation of a single-cylinder research engine. The two main fuels for the Brazilian light-vehicle fleet, gasohol (E27) and bioethanol derived from sugarcane (E100), were directly injected in the tests. After performing a baseline calibration to investigate the best valve timing setup for the camshaft in order to optimize the trapped EGR, the induced tumble motion proved to be an effective method to speed up the combustion flame propagation, enhancing the fuel conversion efficiency. The results showed up to 10% fuel consumption reduction, lower exhaust pollutant emissions of CO₂, CO, NOX and HC when compared to the baseline engine experiments. Improvements in combustion phasing were observed, with the CoV of IMEP always remaining below the upper limit of 3.5%. The internal EGR combination with in-cylinder tumble flow was a powerful strategy to enhance the overall engine efficiency whilst minimizing its environmental impact, especially for the ethanol-fueled tests, in which the compression ratio was raised from 11.5 to 15.0.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadministrative management 3abioethanol 3acalibration 3acarbon dioxide 3acombustion 3adesign 3aemissions 3aenergy conversion 3aenergy use and consumption 3aenvironmental impact 3aflow 3agasohol 3aindustry 3ainjection 3ainternal combustion engines 3apollutants 3aresearch 3asugarcane 3atesting 0aExhaust gas recirculation 0aTumble flow structure 0aFlex-fuel engine 0aFuel conversion efficiency 0aPollutant emissions1 aNetto, Nilton Antônio Diniz1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7387-76851 ada Costa, Roberto Berlini Rodrigues1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5367-57791 aBaêta, José Guilherme Coelho1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2605-726X0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2020 Aug. 01, v. 217 p.113007-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2020.1130073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03098naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001700155245010900172300001400281500001500295520135600310592002801666650004301694650001801737650001401755650002601769650002801795650001101823650002201834650002101856650001301877650001401890650001401904650005201918650002201970650003301992650002102025653002402046653002002070653002102090653002302111653002302134653002202157700001602179700002002195700001702215700002202232700006002254773014402314856008902458852000902547655001202556IND60611815620221117232513.0180904e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061181562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biologicals.2016.09.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRazaghi, Ali10aIs Pichia pastoris a realistic platform for industrial production of recombinant human interferon gamma?  ap. 52-60.  a2019-12-06  aHuman interferon gamma (hIFNγ) is an important cytokine in the innate and adaptive immune system, produced commercially in Escherichia coli. Efficient expression of hIFNγ has been reported once for Pichia pastoris (Wang et al., 2014) – a proven heterologous expression system. This study investigated hIFNγ expression in P. pastoris replicating the previous study and expanding by using four different strains (X33: wild type; GS115: HIS⁻Mut⁺; KM71H: Arg⁺, Mut⁻ and CBS7435: MutS) and three different vectors (pPICZαA, pPIC9 and pPpT4αS). In addition, the native sequence (NS) and two codon-optimised sequences (COS1 and COS2) for P. pastoris were used. Methanol induction yielded no expression/secretion of hIFNγ in X33, highest levels were recorded for CBS7435: MutS (∼16 μg. L⁻¹). mRNA copy number calculations acquired from RT-qPCR for GS115-pPIC9-COS1 proved low abundance of mRNA. A 10-fold increase in expression of hIFNγ was achieved by lowering the minimal free energy of the mRNA and 100-fold by MutS phenotypes, substantially lower than reported by Wang et al. (2014). We conclude that commercial production of low cost, eukaryotic recombinant hIFNγ is not an economically viable in P. pastoris. Further research is required to unravel the cause of low expression in P. pastoris to achieve economic viability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3amessenger RNA 3aphenotype 3aKomagataella pastoris 3aeconomic sustainability 3ahumans 3aadaptive immunity 3ainterferon-gamma 3amethanol 3asecretion 3acytokines 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3aGibbs free energy 3aheterologous gene expression 3aEscherichia coli 0aMinimum free energy 0aPichia pastoris 0aInterferon gamma 0aBiopharmaceuticals 0aProtein expression 0aLow-abundance RNA1 aTan, Emilyn1 aLua, Linda H.L.1 aOwens, Leigh1 aKarthikeyan, O.P.1 aHeimann, Kirsten1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2691-96590 tBiologicals.g2017 Jan., v. 45 p.52-60dElsevier LtdaInternational Alliance for Biological StandardizationwJournal:11999x1045-10567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biologicals.2016.09.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03039naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002300146245013500169500001400304520141400318592002801732650002601760650001301786650002101799650002601820650001001846650001101856650001601867650001601883650001601899650002601915650001801941650002001959650001501979650001701994650001702011650001502028650001002043650002302053650001102076650001002087650002302097650002502120650001102145651001002156700001802166700001202184700001702196700002402213700002402237773012302261856008002384852000902464655001202473IND60718817920221123032327.0201126e20201104xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071881792DNAL7 a10.3390/agronomy101117112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLal Mehriya, Moti 10aResponse of Drip Irrigation and Fertigation on Cumin Yield, Quality, and Water-Use Efficiency Grown under Arid Climatic Conditions  aNAL-light  aA three-year field experiment was conducted at the Agricultural Research Station of Mandor, Jodhpur, Rajasthan, under arid climatic conditions in the rabi season of 2016–2019 with the objectives of evaluating the effect of drip irrigation and fertigation levels on cumin plant growth, yield, oil content, water-use efficiency, and water productivity. The pooled data revealed that the drip irrigation at 0.6 cumulative pan evaporation (CPE) recorded significantly higher plant height (31.4 cm), umbels plant⁻¹ (50.4), umbellates umbel⁻¹ (5.07), seeds umbel⁻¹ (5.34), test weight (4.60 g), seed yield (1063 kg ha⁻¹), gross return (₹ 172,600 ha⁻¹), net return (₹ 113,500 ha⁻¹) and benefit, and cost ratio (2.9) over drip fertigation at 0.4 CPE and surface irrigation with 0.8 CPE. The fertigation with 80% recommended dose of fertilizer (RDF) being at par with 100% RDF recorded a significantly higher number of umbels plant⁻¹ (50.0), umbellates umbel⁻¹ (5.03), seeds umbellate⁻¹ (5.24), test weight (4.67 g), seed yield (1052 kg ha⁻¹), gross return (₹ 170,900 ha⁻¹), net return (₹ 111,700 ha⁻¹), and benefit cost ratio (2.9) over fertigation with 60% RDF and control.

Perceptions of a coach's justice (β = 0.19, p < 0.05), benevolence (β = 0.32, p < 0.05), integrity (β = 0.14, p < 0.05), and competence (β = 0.29, p < 0.05) each had a significant effect on athletes' trust, and they cumulatively accounted for 61% of the variance in trust. The structural equation modeling showed that trust had direct effects on commitment to coach (β = 0.77, p < 0.01), willingness to cooperate (β = 0.79, p < 0.01), and perceived performance (β = 0.51, p < 0.01). The hypothesized mediating effects of commitment to coach and willingness to cooperate were not supported. The model explained 26% of the variance in perceived performance.As trust in coach influences commitment to coach, willingness to cooperate, and perceived performance, coaches need to take effort to bolster their athletes' trust by being just and benevolent, and enhancing their integrity and competence.  aPublisher supplied data 0aBenevolence 0aCommitment 0aCompetence 0aCooperation 0aIntegrity 0aJustice 0aTrust in the coach1 aChelladurai, P.,0 tJournal of Sport and Health Science.g2013 June, v. 2 p.115-121dElsevier B.V.aShanghai University of SportwJournal:23381x2095-25467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jshs.2012.03.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02446naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245017800164300001600342520111200358592002801470650002901498650002101527650001101548650003001559650000901589650001401598650001201612650001001624650001401634650001001648650001501658650002201673650001201695651001901707700001601726700001301742700001801755773016101773856008101934852000902015655001202024IND60685893720221118062017.0200311e200206  xx |||||o|||||||||||fre||7 aIND6068589372DNAL7 a10.1017/S17427584000151982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMondedji, D.10aPotentiel Reproducteur de Dinarmus basalis Rond.

The resulting data were used to determine the longevity and reproductive potential of the species, by establishing its life and fertility tables. In the presence of 16 hosts renewed every 48 hours, D. basalis females had a mean longevity of 32.6 ±1.6 days. They laid an average of 136.5 ± 55.2 eggs, parasitised 132.7 ± 53.9 hosts, and produced 111.8 ± 3 offspring, consisting of 58.3 % of males and 41.7 for females. The total mean development time was 14.0 ± 0.7 days for females and 11.8 ± 0.8 days for males. The net reproductive rate (Rₒ) was 38.9 females progeny per adult female, and the intrinsic rate of population increase (rₘ) 016 per day. The generation time (G) was 22.5 days and the doubling time (DT) 4.3 days. These parameters permitted to determine the reproductive potential of D. basalis as a biological control agent against the bruchid in West Africa.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCallosobruchus maculatus 3aDinarmus basalis 3aadults 3abiological control agents 3aeggs 3afecundity 3afemales 3ahosts 3alongevity 3amales 3aparasitism 3apopulation growth 3aprogeny 3aWestern Africa1 aAmevoin, K.1 aNuto, Y.1 aGlitho, I.

The purpose of this investigation was to prospectively examine the relationship among self-presentational concerns and pre-game affective states among middle and high school aged football players.American football players (n = 112; mean age = 15.57 years) completed a measure of self-presentational concerns (SPSQ, McGowan, et al., 2008) a week prior to the measurement of selected pre-game affective states (i.e., attentiveness, self-assurance, serenity, and fear).Regression analyses revealed that concerns about appearing athletically untalented negatively contributed to the significant prediction (p < 0.001) of pre-game attentiveness, β = −0.43, R2adj = 19.5% (p < 0.001), and self-assurance, β = −0.38, R2adj = 11.9% (p < 0.01).These findings highlight the importance of reducing self-presentational concerns in promoting positive pre-game mental states that likely impact the quality of athletes' competitive play and experience.  aPublisher supplied data 0aAttentiveness 0aLongitudinal 0aSelf-assurance 0aSelf-presentation1 aLochbaum, Marc1 aKleinert, Jens1 aDimmock, James1 aNewton, Maria1 aSchulte, Stefanie0 tJournal of Sport and Health Science.g2013 Sept., v. 2 p.168-175dElsevier B.V.aShanghai University of SportwJournal:23381x2095-25467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jshs.2012.06.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01286naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100001300189245009900202300001400301520023300315592002800548653002400576653001600600653003400616653001300650653001800663700002000681700001500701700001700716700001700733773009500750856008200845852000900927655001200936IND60557698520221122022104.0161103e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055769852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.nmni.2016.06.0082doi7 aPMC49549322pmcid7 a274823872pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDiop, K.10a‘Peptoniphilus vaginalis’ sp. nov., a new species isolated from human female genital tract  ap. 65-66.  aWe relate here the main characteristics of ‘Peptoniphilus vaginalis’, strain KHD2 (= CSUR P0125 = DSM 101742), a new member of the Peptoniphilus genus, cultivated from a vaginal sample of a woman with bacterial vaginosis.  aPublisher supplied data 0abacterial vaginosis 0aculturomics 0a‘Peptoniphilus vaginalis’ 0ataxonomy 0avaginal flora1 aMediannikov, O.1 aRaoult, D.1 aBretelle, F.1 aFenollar, F.0 tNew Microbes and New Infections.g2016 Sept., v. 13 p.65-66dElsevier Ltdx2052-29757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nmni.2016.06.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03012naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245015800170300001600328520162500344592002801969650001301997650001302010650001802023650001502041650001602056650002702072650002202099650001202121650002002133650001002153650001202163650002102175650001202196650001102208650002002219650001102239650001502250650001402265650001402279651001002293773016102303856008102464852000902545655001202554IND60685893820221118061955.0200311e200206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068589382DNAL7 a10.1017/S17427584000151862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAckonor, Joseph B.10aCurrent Levels of Incidence of Parasmsm and Predation in Planococcus citri Risso (Homoptera: Pseudococcidae) in Ghanaian Cocoa (Theobroma cacao L.)

A total of 20,408 P. citri individuals was recorded, comprising adult females, third instar nymphs and mummified individuals harbouring parasitoids. Observed predators were larvae of Coccodiplosis coffeae Barnes (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae), nymphs and adults of Hyperaspis egregia Mader and Scymnus (Pullus) sp. (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), as well as an unidentified lepidopteran. Twelve parasitic Hymenoptera were also reared, including Aenasius abengouroui (Risbec), Leptomastix dactylopii Howard, Anagyrus beneficions Compere, Tropidophryne melvillei Compere, Anagyrus amoenus Compere and Chryptochetum (Lestophonus) spp. Also recorded were a hyperparasitoid, Cheiloneuras carinatus Compere, parasitising Coc. coffeae, Xyphigaster pseudococci Risbec and six rare, undetermined parasitoids. Coccodiplosis coffeae was the commonest parasitoid, occurring throughout the year and infesting 72.8% of the P. citri colonies. Parasitism levels were generally low, the highest mean being 4.6 ± 2.6% for Aen. abengouroui. Simultaneous parasitism by more than one species was common and this gave rise to mean monthly parasitism levels ranging from 0.8 to 4.5%. Aenasius abengouroui, Ana. amoenus and H. egregia are being reported for the first time in P. citri on cocoa in Ghana, and the recovery of L. dactylopii suggests its establishment in the country, where it was introduced in 1949.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAenasius 3aAnagyrus 3aCecidomyiidae 3aHyperaspis 3aLepidoptera 3aLeptomastix dactylopii 3aPlanococcus citri 3aScymnus 3aTheobroma cacao 3afarms 3afemales 3ahyperparasitoids 3ainstars 3alarvae 3anatural enemies 3anymphs 3aparasitism 3apredation 3apredators 3aGhana0 tInternational journal of tropical insect science.g2002 June, v. 22, no. 2 p.105-112dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:J000000093x1742-75927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S17427584000151863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03220naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245011800172300001800290520164900308592002801957650003101985650001502016650001602031650002502047650002102072650001802093650001102111650001402122650001102136650001802147650001402165650002202179653001502201653002702216653002202243653001802265700001902283700001702302700001702319700001802336700002402354700002802378700001802406700003602424700002002460773013002480856008302610852000902693655001202702IND60542668520221119232743.0190405e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054266852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jevs.2014.08.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeroux, Aurélia A.10aAtrial Natriuretic Peptide as an Indicator of the Severity of Valvular Regurgitation and Heart Failure in Horses  ap. 1226-1233.  aNatriuretic peptides are cardiac biomarkers, routinely used for diagnosis, prognosis, and guidance for treatment in human and small animal cardiology. However, their diagnostic and prognostic value in horses has received little study. The aim of this study was to investigate the plasma atrial natriuretic concentration (ANPPl) in a large group of horses with various degrees of valvular regurgitation (VR) and congestive heart failure (CHF). Clinical examination and two-dimensional time-motion mode and Doppler echocardiography were performed on 91 horses admitted to the Equine Teaching Hospital of Liege University, with either no, mild, moderate, or severe VR and presenting various stages of CHF. Plasma atrial natriuretic concentration was measured using a commercially available human radioimmunoassay test. Mean values of body weight, age, ANPPl, and echocardiographic parameters were compared among horses with no, mild, moderate, and severe VR and among horses in different CHF stages. Correlation and linear regression of ANPPl with each echocardiographic parameter and with the percentage of dilation of each of cardiac chambers were assessed. Horses with severe or moderate VR had significantly higher ANPPl than those with mild or no VR. Plasma atrial natriuretic concentration was significantly higher in horses presenting CHF than those without CHF. Plasma atrial natriuretic concentration was significantly correlated with the left atrial diameter and its percentage of dilation. These results suggest a diagnostic value of ANPPl in horses with VR, especially with tricuspid or mitral insufficiency with dilation of the atria.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatrial natriuretic peptide 3abiomarkers 3abody weight 3aclinical examination 3aechocardiography 3aheart failure 3ahorses 3ahospitals 3ahumans 3alinear models 3aprognosis 3aradioimmunoassays 0aCardiology 0aValvular regurgitation 0aCardiac biomarker 0aHeart failure1 aAl Haidar, Ali1 aRemy, Benoit1 aBorde, Laura1 aCerri, Simona1 aHouben, Rosa M.A.C.1 aSandersen, Charlotte F.1 aMoula, Nassim1 aVan Erck Westergren, Emmanuelle1 aAmory, Hélène0 tJournal of equine veterinary science.g2014 Oct., v. 34, no. 10 p.1226-1233dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl33309x0737-08067nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jevs.2014.08.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02901naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001300139245016400152300001600316520145700332592002801789650001901817650002601836650001001862650001101872650002701883650002001910650001601930650001401946650001301960650002201973650001701995650001802012650001002030650001102040650001202051650001302063650003702076700001702113700001402130700001602144700002002160773016902180856007302349852000902422655001202431IND60163084520221122081410.0150530e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6016308452DNAL7 a10.1111/sum.121832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlho, L.14aThe effect of arbuscular mycorrhiza fungal propagules on the growth of subterranean clover (Trifolium subterraneum L.) under Mn toxicity in ex situ experiments  ap. 337-344.  aThe role of intact extraradical mycelium (ERM) as the most effective fungal propagule in the formation of the tripartite symbiosis between indigenous arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), rhizobia and subterranean clover was investigated under conditions of Mn toxicity. ERM was previously developed in 8 L pots under greenhouse conditions by growing plants, which exhibited various levels of mycotrophicity and were tolerant to the levels of Mn in the soil used in the experiment (Silene gallica L, Lolium rigidum L, Ornithopus compressus L. and Rumex bucephalophorus L). Contrasting conditions of the integrity of the ERM at the planting of subterranean clover were created by soil disturbance (ERM fragmented – soil disturbed; ERM intact – soil undisturbed). Where an intact ERM was present at the time of planting, growth of subterranean clover was 2.5 times greater after 21 days and 3.9 times after 42 days relative to other forms of AMF propagule. This enhanced growth was associated with a reduction in the Mn concentration of roots due to a greater AMF colonization at 21 days after planting. The protection granted by an enhanced AMF root colonization allowed a greater root nodule development, leading to more N acquisition and plant growth. The ERM can be developed in the soil by mycotrophic plants tolerant to the stressing agent and kept intact at the seeding of the crop to be protected by adopting appropriate tillage techniques.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLolium rigidum 3aOrnithopus compressus 3aRumex 3aSilene 3aTrifolium subterraneum 3adisturbed soils 3agreenhouses 3amanganese 3amycelium 3amycorrhizal fungi 3aplant growth 3aplanting date 3aroots 3asowing 3atillage 3atoxicity 3avesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae1 aCarvalho, M.1 aBrito, I.1 aGoss, M.

Little is known about the potential value of new species and cultivars when intercropped with sorghum and planted in the second crop season. The objective of this study was to evaluate the performance (agronomic characteristics) of grain sorghum and the production and nutritional characteristics of forage plants of the genus Brachiaria in an integrated agricultural production system in the second season. The experiment had a randomized block design with four replicates. The treatments consisted of the intercropping of sorghum with forage plants of the genus Brachiaria (Ruziziensis grass, Marandu, Xaraes, Piata, Paiaguas palisadegrass and Ipypora grass), in addition to an extra treatment with sorghum in monoculture. The results showed that sorghum intercropping with Ruziziensis grass, Paiaguas palisadegrass, Piata, and Ipypora grass did not cause a reduction in grain yield. The Xaraes, Piata, and Paiaguas palisadegrass showed higher forage production. However, the Paiaguas, Piata palisadegrass, and Ipypora grass showed better nutritional value. The sorghum intercropping with forage plants of the genus Brachiaria were promising alternatives for grain and forage production in the off-season. The right forage grass combined with sorghum in an integrated system can intensify agricultural production, optimizing the use of the area and increasing sustainability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrachiaria 3aagronomic traits 3aagronomy 3aarea 3acultivars 3adesign 3aforage grasses 3aforage production 3agrain sorghum 3agrain yield 3aintercropping 3anew species 3anutritive value 3aproduction technology1 aCosta, Kátia  Aparecida1 aSeveriano, Eduardo 1 aSilva, Alessandro da,1 aDias, Mariana 1 aOliveira, Guilherme 1 aCosta, João Victor,0 tAgronomy.g2020 Nov. 05, v. 10, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12361x2073-43957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy101117143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02839naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001200152245011000164500001400274520131300288592002801601650003001629650001801659650001101677650002201688650001601710650001601726650001101742650001501753650001701768650001801785653000901803653000901812653000801821653000801829653000801837653000801845653003101853653001301884653002201897653003001919653001801949700005801967700001502025700001402040700005502054773011602109856008702225852000902312655001202321IND60696984520221122223701.0200621e20200801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069698452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2020.1130122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSu, Hao10aExperimental investigation of a novel vertical axis wind turbine with pitching and self-starting function  aNAL-light  aWind, as a renewable, cost-competitive, and no air-pollution energy source, has caught worldwide attention. As a result of defective performance and backwardness in research, vertical axis wind turbines leg behind horizontal axis wind turbines in terms of commercial application, especially for large-scale wind turbines. In the present study, a new type of straight-bladed vertical axis wind turbine consisting of three pairs of blades has been introduced and tested in a wind tunnel to verify the reliability and efficiency of the novel configuration. There is a fixed main blade and a rotatable auxiliary blade (with different chord and span lengths from that in the main blade) in each pair of the blades. The experimental results demonstrate that the static torque coefficient of the proposed rotor is positive at all azimuthal angles and significantly higher than that of the traditional H-type rotor, which shows better self-starting performance. The proposed wind turbine can obtain a higher power coefficient compared to a traditional three-blade H-type rotor under the wind speeds varying from 4.54 m/s to 8.82 m/s. Besides, the power output of the wind turbine can be effectively controlled through the auxiliary blades pitching, and constant power output can be achieved in varying wind speeds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadministrative management 3aair pollution 3ablades 3aenergy conversion 3aexhibitions 3areliability 3atorque 3awind speed 3awind tunnels 3awind turbines 0aVAWT 0aHAWT 0aCFD 0aBEM 0aTSR 0aAoA 0aVertical axis wind turbine 0aPitching 0aPower coefficient 0aStatic torque coefficient 0aSelf-starting1 aDou, Bingzheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5192-10671 aQu, Timing1 aZeng, Pan1 aLei, Liping1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2281-70300 tEnergy conversion and management.g2020 Aug. 01, v. 217 p.113012-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2020.1130123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02980naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005700094040001800151100002100169245014000190300001600330520195100346592002802297653001202325653002102337653002402358653002202382700002402404700002202428773011402450856011702564852000902681655001202690IND60124955820221116234149.0151101e200012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012495582DNAL7 a10.1636/0161-8202(2000)028[0329:ASIOAG]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aToti, Douglas S.12aA structured inventory of appalachian grass bald and heath bald spider assemblages and a test of species richness estimator performance  ap. 329-345.  aThe current rate of species attrition necessitates the development of quick and accurate sampling protocols and species richness estimators. Four time-based and one area-based methods were used to sample spiders of a grass bald and a heath bald in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park in late spring and early fall of 1995. Eighty-four samples were collected at each site; 1853 adults and 91 species were found in the grass bald, 573 adults and 60 species in the heath bald. The data were analyzed with 11 species richness estimators: Chao & Lee 1, Chao & Lee 2, ACE, ICE, bootstrap, Chao 1, Chao 2, first-order jackknife, second-order jackknife, Michaelis-Menten runs, and Michaelis-Menten means. All but the Chao & Lee estimators generated richness estimates that clustered within a reasonable range, 106–160 species for the grass bald and 68–90 species for the heath bald. The failure of the observed species accumulation curve to level off for our data sets showed that more sampling would be needed to determine the number of species present as adults during the two sampling seasons. Although this prevented us from rigorously testing richness estimator performance, we found that the Michaelis-Menten means estimator performed better than the other estimators when judged by two indirect criteria of good estimator performance—the estimator curve should reach an asymptote with fewer samples than are required for the observed species accumulation curve to reach an asymptote, and the estimates should be close to reasonable visual extrapolations of the asymptote of the observed species accumulation curve. We postulate that the differences we found in species richness and taxon and guild composition between the spider assemblages of these two bald communities are, at least in part, a consequence of striking differences in the physiognomy, richness, and taxonomic composition of the plant associations of the two communities.  aPublisher supplied data 0aSpiders 0aspecies richness 0arichness estimators 0aAppalachian balds1 aCoyle, Frederick A.1 aMiller, Jeremy A.0 tJournal of arachnology.g2000 Dec., v. 28, no. 3 p.329-345dAmerican Arachnological Society.x0161-82027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1636%2F0161-8202%282000%29028%5B0329%3AASIOAG%5D2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02228naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001900137245012900156300001600285500001900301520092200320592002801242650002101270650001401291650001201305650001601317650001101333650003101344650001901375650001901394650001801413653001301431653003301444653002701477653001601504653001601520700001601536700001601552700001601568700001601584773010201600856007101702852000901773655001201782IND60695715320221122022654.0200518e20170701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069571532DNAL7 a10.2216/16-87.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Huiling10aControl of Microcystis (Cyanobacteria) using the fruit of Macleaya cordata: from laboratory experiment to in situ field test  ap. 382-389.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aBiologically derived algicidal substances are regarded as environmentally friendly in the control of harmful cyanobacterial blooms. To evaluate the possible control of Microcystis-based water blooms using fruit from Macleaya cordata (MC-fruit), the effects of MC-fruit on the growth, polyphasic chlorophyll fluorescence transients, microcystin production and efficacy of in situ cyanobacterial bloom removal were investigated. The results showed that MC-fruit could effectively inhibit the growth of M. aeruginosa PCC7806 at a concentration of 1 mg l⁻¹. MC-fruit stress caused severe damage to photosynthesis of M. aeruginosa and decreased the content of cellular microcystin-LR. The results of an in situ field test showed that MC-fruit effectively reduced the biomass of Microcystis and improved water quality.

Here it is shown that M2-2 mediated transcriptional inhibition is managed through P protein phosphorylation.Transcription inhibition by M2-2 of the HRSV based minigenome pRSVluc, required P protein phosphorylation at serines (S) in positions 116, 117, 119 and increased inhibition is observed if S232 or S237 is also phosphorylated. Phosphorylation of these residues is required for viral particle egression from infected cells.Viral RNA synthesis complementation assays between P protein variants, suggest that two types of P proteins participate in the process as components of RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). Type I is only functional when, as a homotetramer, it is bound to N and L proteins through residues 203–241. Type II is functionally independent of these interactions and binds to N protein at a region outside residues 232–241.P protein type I phosphorylation at S116, S117 and S119, did not affect the activity of RdRp but this phosphorylation in type II avoids its interaction with N protein and impairs RdRp functionality for transcription and replication. Structural changes in the RdRp, mediated by phosphorylation turnover at the indicated residues, in the two types of P proteins, may result in a fine adjustment, late in the infectious cycle, of transcription, replication and progression in the morphogenetic process that ends in egression of the viral particles from infected cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aproteins 3avirion 3aHuman orthopneumovirus 3atranscription (genetics) 3aRNA-directed RNA polymerase 3aRNA 3aprotein phosphorylation 0aTranscription 0aP protein phosphorylation 0aHuman respiratory syncytial virus 0aViral RNA synthesis 0aReplication 0aM2-2 protein1 aVillanueva, Nieves0 tVirus research.g2016 Jan. 04, v. 211 p.117-125dElsevier B.V.x0168-17027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2015.10.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01607naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005700094040001800151100002600169245010400195300001600299520054800315592002800863653001200891653001600903653001300919653001300932700002100945700002300966700001600989700001701005700001901022773011401041856011701155852000901272655001201281IND60124955920221116233316.0151101e200012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012495592DNAL7 a10.1636/0161-8202(2000)028[0346:DTPOPP]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHerberstein, Marie E.10aDoes the presence of potential prey affect web design in argiope keyserlingi (araneae, araneidae)??  ap. 346-350.  aOrb-web spiders may anticipate their future prey environment by detecting the presence of prey and adjusting their web building behavior accordingly.

How phosphorus (P) application affects Cu and Fe concentrations in maize grain still remains unclear. Two-year field studies were conducted in a long-term experiment with six P levels (0, 12.5, 25, 50, 100, and 200 kg∙ha⁻¹ P) on calcareous soil. Phosphorus application significantly decreased the average grain Cu concentration by 12.6% compared to no P treatment, but had no effect on grain Fe concentration. The copper content increased as the P application rate increased from 0 to 25 or 50 kg·ha⁻¹, but then decreased, while Fe content kept increasing. As the P application rate increased, the specific Cu uptake by the roots decreased, but not for Fe. The root length density in response to P application had a positive relationship with shoot Cu and Fe content. The shoot Cu content and grain Cu concentration decreased with the reduction in the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) colonization of roots due to increasing P application. The reduction in grain Cu concentration with increasing P rates could be partly explained by the decreasing uptake efficiency.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagronomy 3aanimals 3acalcareous soils 3acopper 3acorn 3adensity 3afertilizer rates 3airon 3alength 3along term experiments 3amycorrhizal fungi 3aphosphorus 3aroots1 aZou, Chunqin 1 aChen, Xiuxiu 1 aLiu, Yumin 1 aLiu, Dunyi 1 aYang, Huaiyu 1 aDeng, Yan 1 aChen, Xinping 0 tAgronomy.g2020 Nov. 05, v. 10, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12361x2073-43957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy101117163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03046naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245014000164520150400304592002801808650001201836650001501848650002001863650002801883650001501911650001301926650000901939650001901948650001301967650001501980650001901995650001402014650002402028650002002052650001702072653001302089653001602102653003202118653002502150653003002175700001702205700001402222700001502236700001502251700005702266700001802323773009202341856008602433852000902519655001202528IND60739132920221122030252.0211219e20211001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073913292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2021.1225312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Xin10aDual signal amplification based on polysaccharide-initiated ring-opening polymerization and click polymerization for exosomes detection  aExosomes, as a biomarker with enhancing tumor invasion and spread, play an essential role for lung cancer diagnosis, therapy, and prognosis. In this work, a novel electrochemical sensor was fabricated for detecting exosomes secreted by lung cancer cells based on polysaccharide-initiated ring-opening polymerization (ROP) and click polymerization. First, MPA formed a self-assembled monolayer on the gold electrode surface, and then anti-EGFR was immobilized on the electrode surface by amide bond. Subsequently, a lot of phosphate groups were introduced by the specific recognition between anti-EGFR and exosomes, then sodium alginate grafted Glycidyl propargyl ether (SA-g-GPE) prepared via ROP was attached to the exosomes through PO₄³⁻Zr⁴⁺-COOH coordination bond. After that, click polymerization was initiated by alkyne groups on the SA-g-GPE polymerization chain to realize highly sensitive detection of A549 exosomes. Under the optimum conditions, the fabricated sensor showed a good linear relationship between the logarithm of exosomes concentration and peak current in the range of 5 × 10³ - 5 × 10⁹ particles/mL, and the limit of detection (LOD) was as low as 1.49 × 10² particles/mL. In addition, this method had the advantages of high specificity, anti-interference, high sensitivity, simplicity, rapidity and green economy, which proposed a novel avenue for the detection of exosomes, and also had potential applications in early cancer diagnosis and biomedicine.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkynes 3abiomarkers 3adetection limit 3aeconomic sustainability 3aelectrodes 3aexosomes 3agold 3alung neoplasms 3amedicine 3aphosphates 3apolymerization 3aprognosis 3asensors (equipment) 3asodium alginate 3atherapeutics 0aExosomes 0aLung cancer 0aRing-opening polymerization 0aClick polymerization 0aElectrochemical detection1 aLiu, Zenghui1 aLi, Jinge1 aLi, Zutian1 aSi, Fuchun1 aYang, Huaixia1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5077-40021 aKong, Jinming0 tTalanta.g2021 Oct. 01, v. 233 p.122531-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2021.1225313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02585naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100001700161245006600178300001600244500000900260520132500269592002801594650001701622650002101639650002101660650001501681650001901696650001601715650001901731650002301750650001301773650000901786650002301795650002001818650002301838650000901861650002101870700002001891773014701911856009602058852000902154655001202163IND60668144420221118065335.0191125e197505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066814442DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1975.03615995003900030045x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWells, B.

The N sources were applied either preplant or topdress at rates up to 235 kg/ha to drill-seeded rice which was flooded at approximately 2 weeks following seedling emergence. Grain yields, dry weight, and N uptake indicated that the controlled-release N sources could be used to regulate rate of N supply to the plant throughout the growing season. Growth of direct seeded rice was slowed considerably during the early part of the growing season due to the slow rate of N release but grain yields were not drastically altered. Grain yields on the silt loam soils following use of the controlled-release N fertilizers were consistently equal to those following use of urea or ammonium sulfate. On the clay soils under intermittent flooding, use of SCU resulted in increased yields as compared to urea applied preplant, and in one year resulted in increased yields as compared to urea applied in split top-dress doses. Both SCU and I.B.D.U. were suitable N sources for rice growing under the water management systems employed in these studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOryza sativa 3aammonium sulfate 3aapplication rate 3aclay soils 3adirect seeding 3agrain yield 3agrowing season 3amanagement systems 3anitrogen 3arice 3aseedling emergence 3asilt loam soils 3asulfur-coated urea 3aurea 3awater management1 aShockley, P.

Two different biochars (MSB and PMW) and two ACs (CP1 and BP2) were used in the present experiment. Addition of AC/biochar to sewage sludge caused significant decrease of freely dissolved PAHs concentration. Depending on the dose, the reduction of freely dissolved PAHs ranged from 56% to 95% (ACs) and from 0% to 57% (biochars). Only for the biochars was there a significant difference between short 7-d and long 30/60-d mixing time. It is concluded that both AC and biochar are effective at reducing PAH pore-water concentrations, the more expensive and non-carbon negative AC having the greatest effect.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated carbon 3abiochar 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3asewage sludge 2aCarbonxchemistry 2aCharcoal 2aPolycyclic Compoundsxanalysis 2aSewage 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysis1 aHale, Sarah E.1 aLehmann, Johannes1 aCornelissen, Gerard0 tBioresource technology.g2012 May, v. 111 p.84-91dElsevier Ltdx0960-85247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2012.02.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02267naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002700147245011600174300001600290520102300306592002801329650002401357650001301381650001401394650001701408650000901425650001501434650001501449650001201464650001701476650003101493650001501524650001501539650001501554650001201569650001301581651001101594773016201605856008101767852000901848655001201857IND60685894220221118061937.0200311e200209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068589422DNAL7 a10.1017/S17427584000121082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNkunika, Phillip O.

The methods used included surveys, participatory rural appraisal (PRA), transect walks and semi-structured interviews (SSI). It was found that ITK does exist among some Muswishi smallholder farmers. Eighty-nine percent of respondent farmers never used any chemical pesticides. However, 22% used natural products to manage insect pests. The most widely used natural plant products were Swartzia madascariensis Desv, Tephrosia vogelli Hook.f, Euphorbia tirucalli L, wood ash and cow dung. Farmer’s own assessment indicated that the integration of ITK into IPM technology led to increased maize yields (> 37.5%). This study demonstrated the continuing need for integrating ITK into IPM technology. Such an approach could ensure household food security and enhance sustainable livelihoods of rural smallholder farmers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuphorbia tirucalli 3aSwartzia 3aTephrosia 3acase studies 3acorn 3acow manure 3acrop yield 3afarmers 3ainsect pests 3aintegrated pest management 3ainterviews 3alivelihood 3apesticides 3asurveys 3awood ash 3aZambia0 tInternational journal of tropical insect science.g2002 Sept., v. 22, no. 3 p.235-240dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:J000000093x1742-75927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S17427584000121083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02947naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005900151245010100210520113300311592002801444650005201472650001601524650001601540650002001556650002601576650002801602650001801630650000901648650001901657650001101676650001501687650001901702650002601721650002401747650003001771653003501801653001201836653001501848653003201863653002901895653003601924700006201960700006202022700002102084700001802105700002102123700005802144700001602202773009202218856008602310852000902396655001202405IND60739133020221120211616.0211219e20211001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073913302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2021.1225322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCennamo, Nunzio1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7769-098410aSARS-CoV-2 spike protein detection through a plasmonic D-shaped plastic optical fiber aptasensor  aA specific aptameric sequence has been immobilized on short polyethyleneglycol (PEG) interface on gold nano-film deposited on a D-shaped plastic optical fiber (POFs) probe, and the protein binding has been monitored exploiting the very sensitive surface plasmon resonance (SPR) phenomenon. The receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein has been specifically used to develop an aptasensor. Surface analysis techniques coupled to fluorescence microscopy and plasmonic analysis have been utilized to characterize the biointerface. Spanning a wide protein range (25 ÷ 1000 nM), the SARS-Cov-2 spike protein was detected with a Limit of Detection (LoD) of about 37 nM. Different interferents (BSA, AH1N1 hemagglutinin protein and MERS spike protein) have been tested confirming the specificity of our aptasensor. Finally, a preliminary test in diluted human serum encouraged its application in a point-of-care device, since POF-based aptasensor represent a potentially low-cost compact biosensor, characterized by a rapid response, a small size and could be an ideal laboratory portable diagnostic tool.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 3aaptasensors 3ablood serum 3adetection limit 3adiagnostic techniques 3afluorescence microscopy 3aglycoproteins 3agold 3ahemagglutinins 3ahumans 3ananosheets 3aoptical fibers 3apoint-of-care systems 3apolyethylene glycol 3asurface plasmon resonance 0aSelf assembled monolayer (SAM) 0aAptamer 0aSars-CoV-2 0aPlastic optical fiber (POF) 0aPolyethyleneglycol (PEG) 0aSurface plasmon resonance (SPR)1 aPasquardini, Laura1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9171-78561 aArcadio, Francesco1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7863-743X1 aLunelli, Lorenzo1 aVanzetti, Lia1 aCarafa, Vincenzo1 aAltucci, Lucia1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7312-53871 aZeni, Luigi0 tTalanta.g2021 Oct. 01, v. 233 p.122532-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2021.1225323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02477naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245009900171506010400270506007600374520111900450592002801569506003701597650002001634650001301654650001901667653002601686653000901712653000801721653002401729653002101753700002501774700002001799700002001819700002101839700002301860773010201883856008501985852000902070655001202079IND60775594420221207133403.0220614e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077559442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoinf.2022.1016522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhan, Ali Hassan13aAn open 3D CFD model for the investigation of flow environments experienced by freshwater fish  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aComputational fluid dynamics (CFD) provides a powerful numerical tool to simulate and study many of the complex fluid-body interactions experienced by freshwater fish. However, major gaps remain in the application of CFD to study the fluid-body interactions of fish, including the absence of an openly available reference body geometry, the lack of a detailed study on suitable numerical methods and a deficit of available velocity laboratory measurements for model calibration and validation. To address these gaps, we provide a set of numerical models based on the open-source CFD toolkit OpenFOAM. The contributions of this work are two-fold: First, to provide a validated openly available numerical setup using a realistic fish model geometry including laboratory velocity measurements. Second, to determine the best-performing turbulence models and near-wall treatments using Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) numerical simulations. Finally, we conclude with a critical evaluation of the effects and trade-offs of resolving or modelling the boundary layer (BL) in numerical studies of fish-shaped bodies.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3afreshwater fish 3ageometry 3aturbulent flow 0aFreshwater ecosystems 0aFish 0aCFD 0aNumerical modelling 0aModel validation1 aRuiz Hussmann, Karla1 aPowalla, Dennis1 aHoerner, Stefan1 aKruusmaa, Maarja1 aTuhtan, Jeffrey A.0 tEcological informatics.g2022 July, v. 69 p.101652-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:2190x1574-95417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2022.1016523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03073naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100003000139245008700169520188700256592002802143650001902171650001702190650001302207650001702220650001502237650001502252650001702267650001202284650001302296650001902309650001902328650002102347650001402368700003402382700002702416700003102443773011902474856007302593852000902666655001202675IND60653552120221122031303.0190714e20190406xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065355212DNAL7 a10.3390/w110407122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCorral Bobadilla, Marina 10aEffecting Partial Elimination of Isocyanuric Acid from Swimming Pool Water Systems  aIt is essential to disinfect the water in swimming pools in order to deactivate pathogenic microorganisms. Chlorination of swimming pool water provides rapid and long-lasting disinfection, but leads to the formation of potentially toxic compounds, including isocyanuric acid, that are used to stabilize chlorine in pool water. Hygiene and health guidelines require an isocyanuric acid concentration in swimming pools of 25 to 75 ppm and that there be no level in excess of 100 ppm. This paper provides a new method to partially remove isocyanuric acid from the water of swimming pool systems with the use of melamine-based reagents. A melamine-photometry process stabilizes the isocyanuric acid. The melamine-based reagent that is added to the raw water reacts with the isocyanuric acid and forms a precipitated salt. The reaction also creates turbidity that is proportional to the isocyanuric acid concentration in the water. It was noted in this study that the optimum functioning range of melamine doses in the raw water was 0.04 to 0.06 g/L and that the reduction of isocyanuric acid in raw water increased as the dose of melamine was increased. Thus, it is necessary to obtain an estimate of the dose of melamine that is necessary to reduce the isocyanuric acid in the water without needing to add fresh water from the network to dilute it. Finally, it can be stated that eliminating isocyanuric acid that has accumulated in a pool&rsquo;s water by treatment with melamine provides an efficient process, as it eliminates the amount of isocyanuric acid that is necessary to conform to the human health criteria of the European Union Directive 2006/7/EC. Treatment with melamine also reduces water network consumption and sewer discharge by successive purges that eventually will become unnecessary. Therefore, this proposed method is environmentally and economically beneficial.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3achlorination 3achlorine 3adisinfection 3afreshwater 3aguidelines 3ahuman health 3ahygiene 3amelamine 3amicroorganisms 3aswimming pools 3atoxic substances 3aturbidity1 aVergara González, Eliseo  P.1 aLostado Lorza, Rubén 1 aSomovilla Gómez, Fátima 0 tWater.g2019 Apr. 06, v. 11, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w110407123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03365naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001200137245016600149300001600315500001900331520197600350592002802326650001002354650002402364650001602388650001402404650001302418650002602431650001902457650001302476650001602489650001102505650001802516650001602534650001202550650001102562653001902573653001702592653000902609653002702618700001702645700002002662700002002682773010102702856007102803852000902874655001202883IND60695715620221122022428.0200518e20170501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069571562DNAL7 a10.2216/16-91.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Xu10aInteractive effects of nutrient availability and temperature on growth and survival of different size classes of Saccharina japonica (Laminariales, Phaeophyceae)  ap. 253-260.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn northern Japan, the production of Saccharina japonica exhibits marked annual fluctuation due to changes in seawater temperature and nutrient availability during winter and spring. To better understand this phenomenon, we examined the combined effects of temperature (5°C, 10°C, 15°C and 20°C) and nutrient availability (seawater enriched with 25% Provasoli's enriched seawater vs nonenriched seawater) on photosynthesis, growth and survival and nitrogen and chlorophyll a contents of juvenile sporophytes (2–3 cm) and larger size class sporophytes (100–150 cm) from southern Hokkaido. Both juvenile sporophytes and discs from 100–150-cm-class sporophytes cultured in enriched seawater showed significantly higher growth rates and photosynthetic activities than those cultured in nonenriched seawater. This difference likely was due to the significantly higher nitrogen and chlorophyll a contents of thalli grown in enriched seawater. Significant effects of temperature on growth and photosynthesis were also detected. A significant interaction between temperature and nutrient availability for relative growth rate (RGR) was detected. The positive effect of elevated nutrient availability on RGRs was magnified by an increase in temperature from 5°C to 15°C for juvenile sporophytes and from 5°C to 10°C for 100–150-cm-class sporophytes; whereas, the negative effect of elevated temperature from 10°C to 15°C on RGRs of 100–150-cm-class sporophytes was antagonised by a reduction in nutrient availability. In contrast to the 100% survival rate in enriched seawater, dead juvenile sporophytes and discs from 100–150-cm-class sporophytes were found at 15°C and 20°C in nonenriched seawater, and the survival rates decreased with increasing temperature. Therefore, the growth and survival of sporophytes of S. japonica are significantly affected by nutrient availability and temperature, which may lead to marked fluctuations in annual production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aJapan 3aSaccharina japonica 3achlorophyll 3ajuveniles 3anitrogen 3anutrient availability 3aphotosynthesis 3aseawater 3asporophytes 3aspring 3asurvival rate 3atemperature 3athallus 3awinter 0aGlobal warming 0aGrowth phase 0aKelp 0aProduction fluctuation1 aEndo, Hikaru1 aNagaki, Michiko1 aAgatsuma, Yukio0 tPhycologia.g2017 May 1, v. 56, no. 3 p.253-260dTaylor & FranciswJournal:1959x2330-29687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2216/16-91.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02289naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245013300164300001600297520102100313592002801334650002201362650001001384650001001394650001301404650001601417650001401433650002001447650001201467650001101479650001201490650001001502650003101512650001501543650001201558651001001570700001801580700001701598773016201615856008101777852000901858655001201867IND60685894320221118061853.0200311e200209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068589432DNAL7 a10.1017/S17427584000120912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaraiyan, K.10aProthoracicotropic Hormone and Ecdysone Action on Moulting in the Penultimate Instar of Tobacco Cut Worm, Spodoptera Litura (F.)  ap. 225-234.  aSpodoptera litura (F.) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) is a serious pest of several crops in India and other countries. Prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH) release from the brain of penultimate fifth instars of the noctuid was followed in the laboratory and a spiracle index developed to assess PTTH action. PTTH release from the brain occurred during the scotophase at 4.30 h of day 1 (AZT). Ecdysone secreted in the prothoracic gland was released from the 7th hour of day 1 (AZT), reaching a maximum in the haemolymph on the 9th hour of day 1 (AZT). The prothoracic gland showed three distinct phases, namely growth, synthesis and release. Injected PTTH of 5th instar brain extract induced larval moulting in head-ligated larvae. Partially purified PTTH from 6th-instar S. litura brain induced moulting in 6th instars. Abdomen-ligated penultimate instars administered β-ecdysone showed variable moulting response. The phenomenon of hormonal interaction with development of the penultimate instar of S. litura is discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSpodoptera litura 3abrain 3acrops 3aecdysone 3aecdysterone 3ahemolymph 3ainduced molting 3ainstars 3alarvae 3amolting 3apests 3aprothoracicotropic hormone 3ascotophase 3atobacco 3aIndia1 aThangaraj, T.1 aAruchami, M.0 tInternational journal of tropical insect science.g2002 Sept., v. 22, no. 3 p.225-234dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:J000000093x1742-75927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S17427584000120913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01302naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005700094040001800151100002600169245010300195300001400298520040500312592002800717653001500745653001100760653001300771653001400784773011200798856011700910852000901027655001201036IND60124956320221116234027.0151101e200104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012495632DNAL7 a10.1636/0161-8202(2001)029[0011:NOTGSW]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrismado, Cristian J.10aNotes on the genus sybota with a description of a new species from argentina (araneae, uloboridae)  ap. 11-15.  aSybota atlantica new species is described from the Atlantic coast of Buenos Aires Province, Argentina.

Additionally, there is no expression system available that can be induced in bacteria growing in vitro as well as in vivo, e.g. in eukaryotic cell lines or in living animal models. Here, we present a series of novel inducible low copy expression vectors that are well suited for use in the Yersinia species. Their tet operator/promoter/repressor system makes them distinct from other vectors, and gene transcription in bacteria can easily be induced by addition of anhydrotetracyline (ATc) either to the growth medium, to tissue culture medium during bacterial infections of cell lines or by injection into animals infected with bacteria. Researchers can choose between two different antibiotic resistances (kanamycin or spectinomycin), between two copy numbers (5 or 12–22) as well as between two different versions for expression from either the native RBS and ATG or RBS and ATG encoded in the plasmid. The whole vector series contains the same multi-cloning site from pBluescript II KS+ that allows for easy subcloning. Moreover, these vectors are built in a modular fashion that makes it simple to adapt them for other purposes. Finally, in addition to their use in Yersinia they are suitable for use in many other Enterobacteriaceae.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aYersinia 3aanimals 3aantibiotic resistance 3abacteria 3abacterial infections 3aculture media 3agene expression 3agenes 3agenetic vectors 3akanamycin 3aplasmids 3aspectinomycin 3atissue culture 3atranscription (genetics)1 aMiller, Virginia L.0 tPlasmid.g2012 July, v. 68, no. 1 p.33-42dElsevier Inc.x0147-619X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plasmid.2012.02.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02308naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245011200170300001600282520097700298592002801275650003201303650002101335650001301356650001401369650002201383650001301405650001201418651001001430653003801440653001201478653003801490653003001528653002601558700001901584700001901603700001601622700001401638700001401652700001701666773008401683856008601767852000901853655001201862IND60566346520221122091450.0170711e20160104xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056634652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.virusres.2015.10.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Zhikun10aMolecular detection and Smoothing spline clustering of the IBV strains detected in China during 2011–2012  ap. 145-150.  aInfectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is a highly variable virus with a large number of genotypes. During 2011–2012, nineteen wild IBV strains were isolated in China. Sequence analysis showed that these isolates were divided into five sub-clusters: A2-like, CKCHLDL08I-like, SAIBK-like, KM91-like and TW97/4-like. Phylogenetic analysis based on the 1118 sequences available on line suggested that all IBVs were classified into six clusters. The prevalent strains including all the isolates were in cluster VI with a 0.194–0.259 genetic distance to Mass type vaccines. In addition, we introduced the smoothing spline clustering (SSC) method to estimate the highly variable sites for some sub-clusters. The results showed that highly variable sites range from sub-clusters, the N-terminal sequences of 4/91-like, TW97/4-like and Arkansas-like are more variable than other sub-clusters. This is the first time that the SSC method has been used for the evolution study of IBV.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInfectious bronchitis virus 3agenetic distance 3agenotype 3aphylogeny 3asequence analysis 3avaccines 3aviruses 3aChina 0aInfectious bronchitis virus (IBV) 0aS1 gene 0aSmoothing spline clustering (SSC) 0aMolecular characteristics 0aEvolutionary analysis1 aZhou, Yingshun1 aWang, Hongning1 aZeng, Fanya1 aYang, Xin1 aZhang, Yi1 aZhang, Anyun0 tVirus research.g2016 Jan. 04, v. 211 p.145-150dElsevier B.V.x0168-17027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2015.10.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03165naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245008800164300001600252500001400268520134800282592002801630650003101658650002901689650002801718650001301746650001101759650002801770650001301798650002301811650001401834650001501848650001501863650001701878650001201895650001001907650002001917650002201937650001901959650002801978650001502006650002602021650001102047650001702058653002502075653001702100653001402117653001902131653002102150700001802171700001902189700001702208700002002225700002402245700001702269700002702286773012202313856008302435852000902518655001202527IND60696985020221122203007.0201118e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069698502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.sajb.2020.04.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBiswas, Dew10aEndophytic sources of diosgenin, a natural steroid with multiple therapeutic values  ap. 119-125.  aNAL-light  aMedicinally important steroid-based compound diosgenin is usually obtained from the secondary metabolic products of several plant species. Diosgenin has been proven as a prospective bioactive drug lead to the pharmaceutical industries as having anti-cancer activity, anti-microbial activity, anti-thrombic activity, anti-diabetic activity, cardioprotective activity, anti-inflammatory activity, osteoarthritis protective activity etc. Observing the multiple therapeutic values of this compound, scientists and chemists have become interested to discover alternative sources. Endophytic microorganisms possess the potentials producing prospective secondary metabolites. Some diosgenin producing endophytic fungi and bacteria are detected and reported by authors. Extraction and quantification of the respective secondary metabolite in a proper way is required initially for its large scale production. Regular involvement of advance biotechnological approaches plus industrial fermentation technology along with proper funding following government policy is necessary for further progress in this field. Exploration of a higher number of diosgenin producing endophytic strains will definitely increase the supply for social requisition in a cost-effective and environment-friendly manner as limiting the excessive exploitation of plant sources.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3aantimicrobial properties 3aantineoplastic activity 3abacteria 3abotany 3acardioprotective effect 3achemists 3acost effectiveness 3adiosgenin 3aendophytes 3aextraction 3afermentation 3afunding 3afungi 3aglycemic effect 3aissues and policy 3aosteoarthritis 3apharmaceutical industry 3ascientists 3asecondary metabolites 3asupply 3atherapeutics 0aSecondary metabolite 0aPharmacology 0aEndophyte 0aQuantification 0aDrug development1 aNazir, Romaan1 aBiswas, Protha1 aKumar, Vijay1 aNandy, Samapika1 aMukherjee, Anuradha1 aDey, Abhijit1 aPandey, Devendra Kumar0 tSouth African journal of botany.g2020 Nov., v. 134 p.119-125dElsevier B.V.aSAABwJournal:jnl34108x0254-62997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sajb.2020.04.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01515naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005700094040001800151100001900169245012600188300001400314520058200328592002800910653002400938653001400962653001600976653001900992773011201011856011701123852000901240655001201249IND60124956420221116234413.0151101e200104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012495642DNAL7 a10.1636/0161-8202(2001)029[0016:OSANGA]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTanikawa, Akio10aOkileucauge sasakii, a new genus and species of spider from okinawajima island, southwest japan (araneae, tetragnathidae)  ap. 16-20.  aSeveral specimens of a unique spider were collected in Okinawajima Island, Southwestern Japan.

Protein-containing test samples are hydrolyzed with strong alkali at 100 °C, neutralized and clarified by filtration before applying the colorimetric assay. The modified method performs with appropriate accuracy and precision, allowing specific polysorbate measurement in the presence of Triton X-100 during virus inactivation, determination of residual amounts of polysorbate in the final products and measurement of polysorbate 80 in final formulated products. The alkaline hydrolysis step, primarily designed to provide the assay's reliability in the presence of protein, also enhances its selectivity towards interference by the non-ionic detergent Triton X-100 and increases its robustness against changes in the fatty acid moiety of polysorbate as it released the fatty acid essentially contributing to the known heterogeneity of polysorbates. These results demonstrate that with sample pretreatment the handy colorimetric assay, not requiring complex instrumentation, can be used to measure polysorbate 80 concentrations in intermediates and final products of therapeutic protein solutions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkaline hydrolysis 3acolorimetry 3adetergents 3afatty acids 3afiltration 3ainstrumentation 3amoieties 3aoctoxynol 3apolysorbates 3aviruses 0aVirus inactivation 0aColorimetric determination of polysorbate 0aSpectrophotometry 0aPlasma-derived medicinal products 0aAOAC 0aCAD 0aELSD 0aEMA 0aHPLC 0aTNBP 0aS/D 0aOD 0a(a)PCC 0aPS 80 0aRSD 0aRT1 aAnderle, Heinz1 aWeber, Alfred0 tBiologicals.g2017 Sept., v. 49 p.6-14dElsevier LtdaInternational Alliance for Biological StandardizationwJournal:11999x1045-10567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biologicals.2017.07.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03039naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245007200175520149700247592002801744650004301772650001201815650001001827650001601837650002201853650001001875650002201885650004601907650001301953650001101966650002601977653004902003653003402052653001502086653001002101653002902111700007102140700002702211700006302238700006602301700002702367773009202394856008602486852000902572655001202581IND60739133320221120211552.0211219e20211001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073913332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2021.1225382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPalasuwan, Duangdao10aG6PD diaxBox: Digital image-based quantification of G6PD deficiency  aGlucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is the most common enzymopathy in humans. More than 400 million people worldwide are affected by this genetic condition. Testing for G6PD deficiency before drug administration is essential for patient safety. Rapidly ascertaining the G6PD status of a person is desirable for proper treatment. The device described in this study, the G6PD diaxBOX, was developed to quantify G6PD deficiency using paper-based analytical devices (PADs) and a colorimetric assay. The G6PD diaxBOX is a straightforward, affordable, portable, and instrument-free analytical system. The major components of the G6PD diaxBox are a banknote-checking UV fluorescent lamp and camera that are easy to access and analysis software. When NADPH is generated, it absorbs at UV 340 nm and emits colored light that is detected with the camera. The determined Pearson's coefficient shows that the color intensity measured from the G6PD diaxBOX correlated with G6PD activity level. Also, a Bland-Altman analysis indicated that more than 95% of the measurement error was in the upper and lower boundaries (±2 SD) and the error from the severe and moderate deficiency group was less than ± 1 SD. Therefore, the error from G6PD diaxBOX was within the limit boundary and the overall accuracy was more than 80%. The G6PD diaxBOX facilitates the effective and efficient quantification of G6PD deficiency and as such represents a clinically well-suited, rapid point-of-care test.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNADP-glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase 3acameras 3acolor 3acolorimetry 3acomputer software 3adrugs 3afluorescent lamps 3aglucosephosphate dehydrogenase deficiency 3apatients 3apeople 3apoint-of-care systems 0aGlucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency 0aPaper-based analytical device 0aUV 340 nm 0aNADPH 0aPoint-of-care (POC) test1 aChalidabhongse, Thanarat H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7249-61351 aChancharoen, Ratchatin1 aPalasuwan, Attakorn1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1903-05121 aKobchaisawat, Thananop1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0545-774X1 aPhanomchoeng, Gridsada0 tTalanta.g2021 Oct. 01, v. 233 p.122538-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2021.1225383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02428naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245015500166300001600321520108700337592002801424650002901452650002301481650002301504650001301527650000901540650001401549650001201563650001401575650001201589650001401601650001401615650001101629650001601640650001601656700001401672700002001686700001901706700001701725773016201742856008101904852000901985655001201994IND60685894520221118061854.0200311e200209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068589452DNAL7 a10.1017/S17427584000120782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGitonga, L.

Nymphal mortality was 87, 48 and 38 % at 20, 25 and 30 °C, respectively. With the exception of first-instar nymphs, percentage mortality was lowest at 25 °C. Pre-oviposition period and longevity decreased with an increase in temperature. Mean daily and total fecundity were 2.1 and 76.4 respectively at 25 °C. The mean developmental period from oviposition to adult eclosion was 27.7, 14.1 and 10.9 days at 20, 25 and 30 °C respectively. There was a linear relationship between temperature and developmental rate (1 /day) of O. albidipennis. Lower thermal thresholds were 13.8, 13.5, 12.7, 15.0, 13.8 and 12.5 °C for eggs and nymphal stages 1 to 5, respectively, with the corresponding average degree-day requirement of 46.9, 42.6, 33.3, 29.2, 26.1 and 51.4 days,, respectively. The implications of these results for biological control of thrips are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMegalurothrips sjostedti 3aOrius albidipennis 3abiological control 3aeclosion 3aeggs 3afecundity 3aflowers 3aheat sums 3alegumes 3alongevity 3amortality 3anymphs 3aoviposition 3atemperature1 aLöhr, B.1 aOverholt, W.

Alterations in pathways of triacylglycerol metabolism can result in their excessive accumulation leading to obesity, insulin resistance, cardiovascular disease and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Most tissues in mammals synthesize triacylglycerols via the glycerol 3-phosphate pathway. However, in the small intestine the monoacylglycerol acyltransferase pathway is the predominant pathway for triacylglycerol biosynthesis where it participates in the absorption of dietary triacylglycerol. In this review, the enzymes that are part of both the glycerol 3-phosphate and monoacylglycerol acyltransferase pathways and their contributions to intestinal triacylglycerol metabolism are reviewed. The potential of some of the enzymes involved in triacylglycerol synthesis in the small intestine as possible therapeutic targets for treating metabolic disorders associated with elevated triacylglycerol is briefly discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aalpha-glycerophosphoric acid 3abiosynthesis 3acardiovascular diseases 3adiet 3aenergy 3afatty liver 3ainsulin resistance 3aobesity 3asmall intestine 3atherapeutics 3atriacylglycerols 0aACAT 0aACSL 0aAGPAT 0aATGL 0a1,2-DG 0aDGAT 0aDGTA 0aER 0aG3P 0aGPAT 0aMBOAT 0aMGAT 0a2-MG 0aPAP 0aTG 0aVLDL 0aTriacylglycerol 0aDiacylglycerol 0aAcyltransferase 0aMonoacylglycerol 0aEnterocyte 0aChylomicron0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2022 June, v. 1867, no. 6 p.159151-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12057x1388-19817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbalip.2022.1591513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03266naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003300113040001800146100002800164245015600192300001800348520178000366592002802146650002102174650001902195650000802214650001502222650001902237650002202256650002202278650001202300650001202312650003502324650002002359650004302379650001602422650001102438650001702449650002202466651001102488700002102499700002602520700002502546700002102571700002802592773009702620856004602717852000902763655001202772IND50089482220221119091738.0140509e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008948222DNAL7 a247618062pmid7 a10.1111/1750-3841.124592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrandão, Marcelo L.

M961-M966.  aThis study aimed to assess the microbiological contamination of lettuces commercialized in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in order to investigate detection of norovirus genogroup II (NoV GII), Salmonella spp., total and fecal coliforms, such as Escherichia coli. For NoV detection samples were processed using the adsorption‐elution concentration method associated to real‐time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). A total of 90 samples of lettuce including 30 whole fresh lettuces, 30 minimally processed (MP) lettuces, and 30 raw ready‐to‐eat (RTE) lettuce salads were randomly collected from different supermarkets (fresh and MP lettuce samples), food services, and self‐service restaurants (RTE lettuce salads), all located in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from October 2010 to December 2011. NoV GII was not detected and PP7 bacteriophage used as internal control process (ICP) was recovered in 40.0%, 86.7%, and 76.7% of those samples, respectively. Salmonella spp. was not detected although fecal contamination has been observed by fecal coliform concentrations higher than 10² most probable number/g. E. coli was detected in 70.0%, 6.7%, and 30.0% of fresh, MP, and RTE samples, respectively. This study highlights the need to improve hygiene procedures at all stages of vegetable production and to show PP7 bacteriophage as an ICP for recovering RNA viruses’ methods from MP and RTE lettuce samples, encouraging the evaluation of new protocols that facilitate the establishment of methodologies for NoV detection in a greater number of food microbiology laboratories. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: The PP7 bacteriophage can be used as an internal control process in methods for recovering RNA viruses from minimally processed and ready‐to‐eat lettuce samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aLactuca sativa 3aRNA 3aSalmonella 3abacteriophages 3acoliform bacteria 3afood microbiology 3ahygiene 3alettuce 3amost probable number technique 3aprocess control 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arestaurants 3asalads 3asupermarkets 3avegetable growing 3aBrazil1 aAlmeida, Davi O.1 aBispo, Fernanda C.

However, their joint toxicity for long-term exposure at low dose has not been thoroughly investigated. In the present study, we investigated the oxidative damages in brain of rats exposed subchronically to organophosphorus pesticide chlorpyrifos (CPF) and heavy metal cadmium (Cd), and their mixtures at the environmentally relevant doses. Rats were given different doses of CPF and Cd by oral gavage for three months. After treatment, brain tissues were subjected for biochemical analysis. Mitochondrial damage and reactive oxidative species were also measured in neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells treated with CPF, Cd and their mixtures. The results showed that CPF and Cd generated protein and lipid peroxidation, disturbed the total antioxidant capability, and altered mitochondria ultrastructure in the brain. Lipids and proteins were sensitive to the oxidative damage induced by CPF and Cd. CPF and Cd decreased mitochondrial potential and induced reactive oxygen species in SH-SY5Y cells. However, the mixture did not display higher toxicity than the sum of that of the individual treatments. Thus, CPF and Cd could have a potential antagonistic interaction on the induction of oxidative stress.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidant activity 3abrain 3acadmium 3achlorpyrifos 3achronic exposure 3afood chain 3aheavy metals 3ahuman health 3alipid peroxidation 3alipids 3amitochondria 3aneurons 3aoxidative stress 3aproteins 3arats 3areactive oxygen species 3atissues 3atoxicity 3atoxicology 3aultrastructure 0aPesticide 0aHeavy metal 0aAntioxidant enzyme 0aLipid peroxidation 0aProtein oxidation 0aBrain1 aWang, Pan1 aSun, Ying-Jian1 aYang, Lin1 aWu, Yi-Jun0 tFood and chemical toxicology.g2017 May, v. 103 p.246-252dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl33424x0278-69157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fct.2017.03.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02266naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245014900165300001600314520118800330592002801518650002101546650001101567650001401578650002401592650003301616650001601649651001001665700002801675700002901703700002701732773011201759856004801871852000901919655001201928IND4481778220221118153240.0120727e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448177822DNAL7 a10.1007/s00334-011-0298-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarinova, Elena13aAn experimental approach for tracing olive processing residues in the archaeobotanical record, with preliminary examples from Tell Tweini, Syria  ap. 471-478.  aTo help the interpretation of possible olive processing residues at archaeological sites, this study examines the changes which occur in pre- and post-charring breakage surfaces of olive stones at tissue level. Fresh olives were experimentally broken before and after charring and heated to different temperatures (230, 330, 430°C) in oxidising and non-oxidising conditions. The structures obtained by the experiment were studied with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and the characteristics for the different temperatures, oxidation regimes and pre- or post-charring fractures were recorded. Furthermore, the experimental specimens were compared with recent and possibly old fractures of several archaeological olive stones from Tell Tweini, Syria. Criteria to infer their formation are discussed. These criteria could be developed further through more experimental replication and additional charring variables, and verified extensively on archaeobotanical assemblages in future studies. The described structures and alterations in the olive stones can be observed using reflected light microscopy, which would allow the proposed approach to be rather easy to apply in practice.  aPublisher supplied data 3alight microscopy 3aolives 3aoxidation 3aprocessing residues 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atemperature 3aSyria1 avan der Valk, Jan M.

Red Grouse Lagopus lagopus scotica chicks constituted 0–4% of all nestling food items. Annually, this reduced annual grouse chick production by 0–6%. Aim: To quantify proportions of diversionary and natural food (including grouse) delivered to Hen Harrier nestlings in relation to brood size, male status and natural prey abundance. Methods: We recorded diversionary food provisioned to 25 Hen Harrier broods (2008–15) and studied the diet of 15 broods using observations from hides, nest cameras and regurgitated pellet analysis. Variation in nestling diet was analysed using compositional analysis. Results: Hen Harriers took 76% of diversionary food provided. Depending on assessment method, average nestling diet was 44–53% diversionary food, 39–55% natural prey (including 24–45% passerines, 4–15% small mammals, 0–4% grouse chicks) and 0–9% unknown items. The amount of diversionary food consumed was not influenced by male status, brood size or natural prey abundance. The number of Red Grouse chicks delivered annually was 34–100% lower than expected under unfed conditions, however, the confidence intervals associated with these estimates were large. Conclusion: Diversionary food influenced Hen Harrier nestling diet and reduced the number of Red Grouse chicks taken relative to modelled predictions. It may help reduce conflict between Hen Harrier conservation and Red Grouse shooting, but only if overall grouse productivity is thereby maintained or increased.  aThis study was conducted as part of the Langholm Moor Demonstration Project, funded by the Game & Wildlife Conservation Trust, Scottish Natural Heritage, Buccleuch Estates, Royal Society for the Protection of Birds and Natural England.  aPublisher supplied data  cNatural Englanddhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001293  cGame & Wildlife Conservation Trust  cBuccleuch Estates  cRoyal Society for the Protection of Birds  cScottish Natural Heritage 3aCircus cyaneus 3aLagopus lagopus scoticus 3aPasseriformes 3acameras 3achicks 3aconfidence interval 3afood intake 3agrouse 3amales 3anestlings 3anests 3aprediction 3asmall mammals1 aMcCluskie, Aly1 aKeane, Paula1 aBarlow, Catherine1 aFrancksen, Richard M.1 aBubb, Damian1 aRoos, Staffan1 aAebischer, N.

The asset protection principle predicts that an animal's risk-taking behaviour should vary as a result of its residual reproductive value (RRV); animals with greater RRV would incur a greater cost if injured or killed and should therefore take fewer risks than those with low RRV. Despite the intuitive appeal of this hypothesis, few studies have effectively separated the effects of RRV on behaviour from those of age. We addressed this weakness in the widely invoked hypothesis by measuring the risk-taking behaviour of female Australian field crickets, Teleogryllus oceanicus, at various points in the animal's lifetime. We found significant effects of age on risk-taking behaviour: older females emerged from a shelter sooner after a simulated predation threat and exhibited greater mobility in an open arena. Importantly, there was also a significant marginal effect of RRV on risk-taking behaviour. Females with lower RRV displayed greater levels of risk taking than females with high RRV. Our results thereby offer support for the asset protection principle as an explanation for state-dependent variation in risk-taking behaviour.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTeleogryllus oceanicus 3adefensive behavior 3afemales 3apredation 3arisk behavior 0aasset protection 0abehavioural plasticity 0amate search 0astate dependency 0aTeleogryllus1 aTomkins, Joseph L.1 aSimmons, Leigh W.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0562-14740 tAnimal behaviour.g2018 Aug., v. 142 p.95-100dElsevier LtdaThe Association for the Study of Animal BehaviourwJournal:jnl45841x0003-34727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2018.06.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03400naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100002500149245011700174300001800291500001500309520221700324592002802541650001402569650001602583650000902599650001102608650000902619650001602628650001102644650001702655650001402672650001202686650001202698653001802710700002302728700002002751700002302771773010202794856008502896852000902981655001202990IND4461918420221118153248.0141112e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446191842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.soilbio.2011.06.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChristensen, Bent T.10aAnnual variation in δ¹³C values of maize and wheat: Effect on estimates of decadal scale soil carbon turnover  ap. 1961-1967.  a2019-12-06  aOn sites where C4-plants have replaced C3-plants, changes in soil δ¹³C allow the turnover of C3- and C4-derived C to be separated. Studies of decadal scale turnover of soil C following conversion to C4-plants generally lack δ¹³C values for previous C4-residue inputs and assume that estimates of C4-derived soil C to be based on a fixed δ¹³C value. Further assumptions are that changes in the initial (time-zero) soil δ¹³C values are insignificant following conversion to C4-plants. We tested these assumptions by measuring: 1) the δ¹³C of annual samples of silage maize biomass (C4-plant) and winter wheat grains (C3-plant) grown during 1988 to 2006, and 2) the δ¹³C of soil kept under bare fallow during 1956 to 1983. The δ¹³C of plants was related to climate variables, and the impact of maize δ¹³C was based on estimates of maize-derived soil C using different approaches to establish the δ¹³C in maize inputs. The δ¹³C of both maize and wheat decreased with time, but the rate of change and annual variations were considerably larger for wheat than for maize. Maize as well as wheat δ¹³C was best related to year (probably reflecting a decrease in atmospheric δ¹³C) and the water balance during the active growth period. Using the smallest (−12.44‰) and the largest (−11.26‰) δ¹³C measured during 1988 and 2006, estimates of maize-derived C in soil after 18 years ranged from 13.2% to 14.2% of the soil total C. Despite a loss of 31% of the soil C pool under bare fallow, the increase in soil δ¹³C was significant only at P < 0.10. We conclude that annual variations in maize δ¹³C values and changes in the δ¹³C of the soil C fraction derived from the pre-conversion C3-vegetation have only little impact on estimates of maize-derived soil C that cover a few decades. For estimates covering several decades to centuries, the subtle but consistent changes in plant and soil δ¹³C need to be accounted for. The variability in δ¹³C in wheat grains suggest that the use of any fixed δ¹³C value for C3-residues in estimates of C turnover in soils on which C4-plants have been replaced by C3-plants can be associated with considerable uncertainty.  aPublisher supplied data 3aC4 plants 3auncertainty 3acorn 3afallow 3asoil 3acorn silage 3acarbon 3awinter wheat 3aC3 plants 3abiomass 3aclimate 0awater balance1 aOlesen, Jørgen E.1 aHansen, Elly M.1 aThomsen, Ingrid K.0 tSoil biology & biochemistry.g2011 Sept., v. 43, no. 9 p.1961-1967dElsevier Ltdx0038-07177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2011.06.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03588naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006000150245015500210300001600365520177900381592002802160650002202188650002102210650002902231650001502260650002002275650001002295650002102305650001102326650001502337650001302352650002802365650001702393650001102410653002902421653002102450653001102471653002902482653003102511653001702542653000802559653001902567653002302586700005802609700001802667700005702685700002102742700001702763773017202780856008502952852000903037655001203046IND60770203720221122002005.0220614e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077020372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jbiosc.2022.03.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNakamura, Mikiko1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4897-822210aTriple gene expressions in yeast, Escherichia coli, and mammalian cells by transferring DNA fragments amplified from a mother yeast expression plasmid  ap. 587-595.  aEscherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and mammalian culture cells are standard host organisms for genetic engineering and research, thus various plasmid vectors have been developed. However, the vectors are designed only for a single host owing to their host-specific genetic elements such as promoters and selection markers. In this study, we developed a yeast expression plasmid that enables the expression of the same gene in E. coli and mammalian cells via the transfer of PCR products amplified from the plasmid as a template. The yeast plasmid YHp26352 was constructed to contain the following regions sequentially: yeast TDH3 promoter (TDH3p), red fluorescent protein (eEmRFP), SV40 terminator (SVpA), E. coli origin (ori), ampicillin resistant gene (AmpR), mammalian cytomegalovirus promoter (CMVp), E. coli srlA promoter (srlAp), and yeast selection marker URA3, which expressed eEmRFP in yeast. To express eEmRFP in mammalian cells, an end-promoter DNA fragment encompassing the eEmRFP-SVpA-ori-AmpR-CMVp region was amplified by PCR and directly used for transfection to mammalian culture cells, resulting in gene expression in mammalian cells through non-homologous end joining. Homologous recombination-mediated circularization was carried out for E. coli cloning and expression by attaching a short overlapping sequence to the 5′-end of a PCR primer, which was used to amplify the eEmRFP-SVpA-ori-AmpR-CMVp-srlAp fragment, after which E. coli transformation was performed. Proof-of-concept experiments were performed by expressing GFP-fused human synaptobrevin VAMP1, and wild-type and codon-changed CLuc luciferase genes in yeast, E. coli, and HEK293 cells. This is the first all-in-one plasmid applicable for expression in three host organisms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA fragmentation 3aEscherichia coli 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aampicillin 3agene expression 3agenes 3ahost specificity 3ahumans 3aluciferase 3aplasmids 3ared fluorescent protein 3atransfection 3ayeasts 0aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 0aEscherichia coli 0aHEK293 0aHomologous recombination 0aNon-homologous end joining 0aEnd-promoter 0aYHp 0aGene synthesis 0aCodon optimization1 aKikuta, Hiroki1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2052-52211 aMisumi, Yukie1 aSuzuki, Ayako1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7405-29281 aHoshida, Hisashi1 aAkada, Rinji0 tJournal of bioscience and bioengineering.g2022 June, v. 133, no. 6 p.587-595dElsevier B.V.aThe Society for Biotechnology, JapanwJournal:jnl3929975x1389-17237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiosc.2022.03.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02539naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245011500165300001600280520135900296592002801655650002301683650002701706650001101733650002601744650002401770650002101794650001101815651001101826651001101837651001201848700001601860700001801876700001901894700001701913773013301930856008102063852000902144655001202153IND60615242120221121233129.0181009e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061524212DNAL7 a10.1007/s00704-017-2291-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDjaman, Koffi10aComparison of sum-of-hourly and daily time step standardized ASCE Penman-Monteith reference evapotranspiration  ap. 533-543.  aThe objective of this study was to quantify differences associated with using 24-h time step reference evapotranspiration (ETo), as compared with the sum of hourly ETo computations with the standardized ASCE Penman-Monteith (ASCE-PM) model for semi-arid dry conditions at Fanaye and Ndiaye (Senegal) and semiarid humid conditions at Sapu (The Gambia) and Kankan (Guinea). The results showed that there was good agreement between the sum of hourly ETo and daily time step ETo at all four locations. The daily time step overestimated the daily ETo relative to the sum of hourly ETo by 1.3 to 8% for the whole study periods. However, there is location and monthly dependence of the magnitude of ETo values and the ratio of the ETo values estimated by both methods. Sum of hourly ETo tends to give higher ETo during winter time at Fanaye and Sapu, while the daily ETo was higher from March to November at the same weather stations. At Ndiaye and Kankan, daily time step estimates of ETo were high during the year. The simple linear regression slopes between the sum of 24-h ETo and the daily time step ETo at all weather stations varied from 1.02 to 1.08 with high coefficient of determination (R ² ≥ 0.87). Application of the hourly ETo estimation method might help on accurate ETo estimation to meet irrigation requirement under precision agriculture.  aPublisher supplied data 3aevapotranspiration 3airrigation requirement 3amodels 3aprecision agriculture 3aregression analysis 3aweather stations 3awinter 3aGambia 3aGuinea 3aSenegal1 aIrmak, Suat1 aSall, Mamadou1 aSow, Abdoulaye1 aKabenge, Isa0 tTheoretical and applied climatology.g2018 Oct., v. 134, no. 1-2 p.533-543dSpringer ViennawJournal:jnl3932171x0177-798X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00704-017-2291-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03037naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004500094040001800139100001500157245012900172300001600301520163600317592002801953650002001981650001402001650001102015650001402026650000902040650001902049650002502068650001602093650002102109650001102130650002002141650001802161651001002179653002102189653002302210653002902233653002102262653001802283700001902301700001702320700001602337773011302353856009202466852000902558655001202567IND60613336720221120203338.0200719e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061333672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2018.07.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yang10aOptimising the design of confined laying hen house insulation requirements in cold climates without using supplementary heat  ap. 282-294.  aSupplementary heat is required when birds do not produce enough heat to maintain adequate air temperature in confined poultry houses in cold climates, and this consists of the largest proportion of building energy consumption. Thus, it is becoming increasingly apparent that the poultry houses need more insulation to retain heat in cold climates. With a well-insulated structure, the thermoneutral temperature can generally be maintained using sensible heat from the birds. Here, the effects of stocking density, indoor temperature setpoint, and ceiling insulation level on ventilation rate, balance temperature, and thermal resistance were described, based on the fundamental heat balance equations for livestock buildings using models. Results illustrated that ventilation rate was influenced by stocking density, and it reduced less than 7.1% when increasing stocking density from 133% to 166% at the outdoor temperature of <−35 °C. The effect of increased stocking density on ventilation rate was greatest when stocking density changed from 33% to 66%. Ventilation rate was not appreciably affected by the indoor temperature set point while the outdoor temperature was <−12.5 °C. Every 1 °C increase in the indoor temperature set point led to a 1.5 °C reduction in balance temperature. Increasing the roof insulation from 110 to 400 mm reduced the balance temperature by 1 °C. The model was validated with measured indoor air temperature in two commercial poultry houses located in the North and Northeast China. The difference between the predicted and measured indoor temperature was found to be less than 5%.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair temperature 3abuildings 3aenergy 3aequations 3aheat 3aheat tolerance 3ainsulating materials 3alaying hens 3amodel validation 3amodels 3apoultry housing 3astocking rate 3aChina 0aVentilation rate 0aThermal resistance 0aSensible heat production 0aStocking density 0aPoultry house1 aZheng, Weichao1 aShi, Haipeng1 aLi, Baoming0 tBiosystems engineering.g2018 Oct., v. 174 p.282-294dElsevier LtdaIAgrEwJournal:jnl70639x1537-51107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2018.07.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02564naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245008700166300001600253520149100269592002801760596004001788650001301828650001501841650000901856650001501865651001601880651001801896651001701914700002401931700001701955700001901972773013301991856008102124852000902205655001202214IND60615242220221121232957.0181009e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061524222DNAL7 a10.1007/s00704-017-2287-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrakash, Satya10aHow accurate are satellite estimates of precipitation over the north Indian Ocean?  ap. 467-475.  aFollowing the launch of the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) Core Observatory in early 2014, motivated from the successful Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM) satellite, an advanced and sophisticated global multi-satellite precipitation product–Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) was released at finer spatio-temporal scales. This precipitation product has been upgraded recently after several refinements and supposed to be superior to other existing global or quasi-global multi-satellite precipitation estimates. In the present study, IMERG precipitation is comprehensively evaluated for the first time against moored buoy observations over the north Indian Ocean at hourly scale for the study period of March 2014 to December 2015. IMERG precipitation performs considerably better over the Bay of Bengal than the Arabian Sea in both detection and estimation. The systematic error in IMERG is appreciably lower by about 14%; however, it generally overestimates in-situ precipitation and also exhibits noticeable false alarms. Furthermore, IMERG essentially shows an improvement over the TRMM Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA) at a daily scale over the north Indian Ocean. IMERG precipitation estimates show overall promising error characteristics, but there is still a need of substantial efforts for improvement in the satellite-based precipitation estimation algorithms especially over data sparse regions such as north Indian Ocean.  aPublisher supplied data  aGAP2996cMinistry of Earth Sciences 3aaccuracy 3aalgorithms 3arain 3asatellites 3aArabian Sea 3aBay of Bengal 3aIndian Ocean1 aRamesh Kumar, M.

In this study, pteryxin, which was previously isolated from the fruits of Mutellina purpurea, was investigated for its inhibitory potential against acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), which are the key enzymes in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The compound was tested in vitro using ELISA microplate reader at 100 μg/ml and found to cause 9.30 ± 1.86% and 91.62 ± 1.53% inhibition against AChE and BChE, respectively. According to our results, pteryxin (IC50 = 12.96 ± 0.70 μg/ml) was found to be a more active inhibitor of BChE than galanthamine (IC50 = 22.16 ± 0.91 μg/ml; 81.93± 2.52% of inhibition at 100 μg/ml). Further study on pteryxin using molecular docking experiments revealed different possible binding modes with both polar and hydrophobic interactions inside the binding pocket of BChE. Top docking solution points out to the formation of two hydrogen bonds with the catalytic residues S198 and H438 of BChE as well as a strong π - π stacking with W231. Therefore, pteryxin as a natural coumarin seems to be a strong BChE inhibitor, which could be considered as a lead compound to develop novel BChE inhibitors for AD treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlzheimer disease 3aApiaceae 3aacetylcholinesterase 3acholinesterase 3acoumarin 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3afruits 3ahydrogen bonding 3ahydrophobic bonding 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3amolecular models 0aPteryxin 0aPyranocoumarin 0aCholinesterase inhibition 0aAlzheimer's disease 0aMolecular docking1 aSenol, Fatma Sezer1 aShekfeh, Suhaib1 aSkalicka-Wozniak, Krystyna1 aBanoglu, Erden0 tFood and chemical toxicology.g2017 Nov., v. 109 p.970-974dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl33424x0278-69157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fct.2017.03.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03653naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245007200176300001600248500001500264520152200279536041201801592002802213596007202241596004102313596003802354596008002392596008402472596003202556596003002588650001502618650001202633650002202645650001102667650001202678650002502690650002402715650001302739650002302752650001102775650001102786650001902797651001802816651001102834651001302845653001002858700002302868700002302891773010302914856008503017852000903102655001203111IND60630407620221119071541.0190207e20181002xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063040762DNAL7 a10.1080/00063657.2018.15244522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnker-Nilssen, Tycho10aFit is fat: winter body mass of Atlantic Puffins Fratercula arctica  ap. 451-457.  a2019-12-06  aCapsule: Atlantic Puffins Fratercula arctica from Scottish and Norwegian populations were significantly heavier in winter than when rearing chicks. Aims: To compare body masses of Atlantic Puffins on their wintering grounds off the Faroe Islands with those of birds rearing chicks at colonies in Scotland and Norway. Methods: We took standardized measurements of wing length and body mass of Atlantic Puffins during the summer chick-rearing period and on the wintering grounds near the Faroe Islands. These measurements were used to estimate seasonal changes in body mass for the two breeding populations. In three cases data were available for individuals weighed both at the colony and on the wintering grounds. Results: On average, Atlantic Puffins breeding in Scotland and Norway increased their body mass by 20–30% between the chick-rearing period and winter. The very limited individual level data accorded well with the population level estimates. Conclusions: Our results provide the first estimates of the order of magnitude in mass change between two key life history stages in this species. They indicate that gains in body mass between chick-rearing and winter are at least double the decline in mass previously recorded between incubation and chick-rearing. Given the Atlantic Puffin’s deteriorating conservation status, improved information on seasonal changes in body condition should help determine the underlying causes of die-offs in major wreck incidents such as those reported in recent years.  aThe work on Hernyken was affiliated to the Norwegian SEAPOP programme and its predecessors, with financial support from the Norwegian Environment Agency, the Norwegian Ministry of Petroleum and Energy (Olje og energidepartementet) and the Norwegian Oil and Gas Association (Norsk olje og gass).

This process usually represents the most energy intensive step in the mining industry. A key advantage about the developed system is that the electric charge is inherently generated as direct current (DC), which can be directly supplied to the electrowinning cells without using intermediate rectifiers. This approach eliminates the energy losses associated, thus increasing the overall efficiency of the power system, and decreases the carbon footprint of the industrial facility. In this context, the main purpose of this first work was to evaluate the energy saving performance of the technology and its application to produce a quality product, which was characterized by morphology, crystal structure and bending behavior. The electrowinning of zinc was selected as case study. Thus, zinc electrodeposition tests were conducted under conditions practiced in industrial operations. The results demonstrated the proper functioning of the HRES system, since constant DC current was supplied to the process. The zinc cathodes exhibited morphology and structure typically described in the literature, which were ductile enough to allow bending without fracturing. On days with global horizontal irradiances in the range from 100 W m⁻² to 1200 W m⁻², 26 ± 4% of the total current supplied to the electrowinning cell was generated by the OPV cells used in this work. In Brazil, this performance corresponds to carbon mitigation of about 6.4 × 10⁻² tons of carbon dioxide equivalents (CO₂ eq) per ton of zinc produced. These findings indicate that hybrid systems with photovoltaic cells represent an alternative to save energy and increase the sustainability of electrowinning processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3abehavior 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon footprint 3acase studies 3acathodes 3acells 3acrystal structure 3aelectroplating 3aenergy 3aenergy conservation 3ahybrids 3aliterature 3amining 3aphotovoltaic cells 3arenewable energy sources 3atechnology 3atesting 3azinc 3aBrazil 0aHybrid renewable energy system 0aOrganic photovoltaic 0aElectrowinning 0aZinc1 aPorto, M.P.1 aVieira, K.C.P.1 aCardoso Filho, B.J.1 aRezende, S.L.S.P.1 aCiminelli, V.S.T.1 aMajuste, D.0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 Apr. 15, v. 293 p.125333-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1253333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03253naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245011200173300001600285520175600301592002802057650002102085650001002106650001602116650002302132650002202155650002102177650001302198650001302211650001402224650002002238650001502258650001102273653002602284653002502310653001402335653001902349653001602368653002602384653001702410700002102427700001902448700005802467773015102525856008602676852000902762655001202771IND60609303820221120160833.0190606e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060930382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anbehav.2018.06.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 avan Berkel, Menno10aCan starlings use a reliable cue of future food deprivation to adaptively modify foraging and fat reserves?  ap. 147-155.  aRegulation of mass in small birds is based on simultaneously minimizing starvation and predation risk, but the mechanisms birds use to assess starvation risk are still debated. While we know that birds anticipate periods of unpredictable food availability/energy expenditure (e.g. the winter and night) by increasing their fat reserves, we do not know whether this anticipation involves learning. This study investigated whether birds could learn to use a light cue that predicted a period of food unavailability, to adaptively regulate their foraging and/or body weight. Sixteen captive starlings, Sturnus vulgaris, were subjected to 42 days of an irregular schedule of food deprivation that involved depriving them of food for 5 h on 20 pseudorandomly chosen days. Birds were randomly allocated to two treatment groups for which a 30 min period of reduced ambient light either provided perfect information (Predictable) or no information (Unpredictable) about upcoming food deprivation. Both groups of birds increased their dawn body mass over the period of the experiment, consistent with a response to unpredictable food deprivation. However, no differences in either foraging behaviour or dawn body mass emerged between the groups, suggesting that the Predictable birds were unable to learn to use the light cue to initiate anticipatory foraging ahead of food deprivation. Furthermore, both groups immediately decreased their foraging behaviour in response to the onset of the light cue, suggesting that starlings do not have an evolved anticipatory foraging response to low light levels. Further work is needed to test alternative cues and designs before any general conclusions can be drawn regarding the flexibility of anticipatory foraging.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSturnus vulgaris 3abirds 3abody weight 3aenergy expenditure 3afood availability 3afood deprivation 3aforaging 3alearning 3apredation 3arisk assessment 3astarvation 3awinter 0aanticipatory foraging 0aassociative learning 0abody mass 0afat regulation 0afood intake 0aunpredictable fasting 0awinter storm1 aBateson, Melissa1 aNettle, Daniel1 aDunn, Jonathon1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9603-73200 tAnimal behaviour.g2018 Aug., v. 142 p.147-155dElsevier LtdaThe Association for the Study of Animal BehaviourwJournal:jnl45841x0003-34727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2018.06.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03333naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245010000169300001600269520174300285536024302028592002802271596002402299596000902323596004402332650002802376650001002404650001302414650001902427650001802446650001402464650001302478650001202491650001202503651001602515651001302531651001002544700001802554700001702572700001602589700001802605700001402623700001702637773010302654856008502757852000902842655001202851IND60630407720221119071538.0190207e20181002xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063040772DNAL7 a10.1080/00063657.2018.15411622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHayhow, D. B.10aBreeding status of Red-billed Choughs Pyrrhocorax pyrrhocorax in the UK and Isle of Man in 2014  ap. 458-470.  aCapsule: In 2014 a survey of Red-billed Choughs Pyrrhocorax pyrrhocorax in the UK and Isle of Man found substantial variation in regional trends. The population has, however, remained stable overall since 2002, with a total of 433 breeding pairs recorded. Aims: The aim of the survey was to produce new estimates of the breeding populations and additional non-breeding birds for the Red-billed Chough in the UK and Isle of Man, and calculate national and regional population trends since previous surveys in 2002 and 1992. Methods: A complete census was attempted, using similar field methods to previous surveys. All known breeding sites and areas of adjacent suitable habitat within the range were surveyed between April and June 2014, with additional surveys on the Isle of Man in 2015. Evidence of breeding was established based on behaviours recorded during two standard visits. Results: The UK and Isle of Man population was estimated at 433 pairs, the majority found in Wales (55%) and Isle of Man (31%). Increases in the Isle of Man, Cornwall and south Wales contrasted with declines recorded in Scotland and in parts of north and mid-Wales. Trends differed regionally and between coastal and inland nesting areas. Conclusions: Numbers of Choughs in the UK and Isle of Man remained stable overall between 2002 and 2014, but trends varied between geographically distinct populations, suggesting the action of diverse drivers of change. Conservation efforts need to be responsive to these pressures by maintaining and enhancing habitat and food resources where required. Where populations are small, research needs to be targeted towards identifying critical demographic stages and facilitating gene flow among adjacent populations.  aWe would like to thank NRW and RSPB for funding this survey in the UK as part of the Statutory Conservation Agencies & RSPB Annual Breeding Bird Surveys (SCARABBS), and to the Manx Chough Project for funding the survey in the Isle of Man.  aPublisher supplied data  cManx Chough Project  cRSPB  cNRWdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100009261 3aPyrrhocorax pyrrhocorax 3abirds 3abreeding 3abreeding sites 3afield methods 3agene flow 3ahabitats 3anesting 3asurveys 3aIsle of Man 3aScotland 3aWales1 aJohnstone, I.1 aMoore, A.

The ζ-potential and coacervate yield data showed that the optimal complexation pH and CS/SPI ratio were 6.0 and 0.125 g g−1, respectively. Isothermal titration calorimetry further confirmed that per molecule of SPI was saturated with 0.104 molecules of CS at pH 6.0, suggesting this binding was high affinity (Ka = 4.16 × 105 ± 0.09 × 105 M−1) and driven by both entropy and enthalpy. The rheological and microstructure measurement indicated that the SPI-CS coacervates had a viscoelastic solid behavior (G′ > G″) with highly interconnected gel-like network structures. The algal oil microcapsule fabricated by the SPI-CS coacervate showed advanced encapsulation efficiency and improved oxidative stability compared to the one encapsulated by SPI alone. The transglutaminase cross-linking could further improved the oxidative stability of SPI-CS microcapsule which proved by the reduced lipid hydroperoxides and volatile hexanal. This improvement was believed to be attributed to the antioxidant properties of CS as well as the increase of protection against oxidation by providing an oxygen barrier after complex coacervation and cross-linking.  aPublisher supplied data 3aviscoelasticity 3alipids 3asoy protein isolate 3amicroencapsulation 3aenthalpy 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3acalorimetry 3amicrostructure 3aprotein-glutamine gamma-glutamyltransferase 3achitosan 3aoxidative stability 3aantioxidant activity 3ahydroperoxides 3acrosslinking 3aalgal oils 3aentropy 3apH 3atitration 3azeta potential 0aSoy protein isolate 0aAlgal oil 0aCoacervate 0aMicrocapsule 0aantioxidants 0aChitosan1 aKong, Zhi-Yan1 aSun, Ying-En1 aZeng, Qing-Zhu1 aYang, Xiao-Quan0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2017 Jan., v. 75 p.171-179dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2016.08.0453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02142naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245010000166500002200266520108500288592002801373650001901401650001301420650001901433653000901452653000801461653001001469653001001479653001701489700001101506700001501517700001601532700001501548700001701563773009701580856008201677852000901759655001201768IND60570519520221121120818.0170708s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057051952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2017.06.1032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiong, Haojun10alncRNA HULC promotes the growth of hepatocellular carcinoma cells via stabilizing COX-2 protein  aPre-press version  aHighly upregulated in liver cancer (HULC), a lncRNA overexpressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), has been demonstrated to be involved in the carcinogenesis and progression of HCC. However, the mechanisms of HULC promoting the abnormal growth of HCC cells are still not well elucidated. In the present study, we for the first time demonstrated that HULC promoted the growth of HCC cells through elevating COX-2 protein. Moreover, the study of the corresponding mechanism by which HULC upregulated COX-2 showed that HULC enhanced the level of ubiquitin-specific peptidase 22 (USP22), which decreased ubiquitin-mediated degradation of COX-2 protein by removing the conjugated polyubiquitin chains from COX-2 and finally stabilized COX2 protein. In addition, knockdown of USP22 or COX-2 attenuated HULC-mediated abnormal growth of HCC cells. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that “USP22/COX-2” axis played an important role in HULC promoting growth of HCC cells. The identification of this novel pathway may pave a road for developing new potential anti-HCC strategies.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarcinogenesis 3ahepatoma 3aneoplasm cells 0aHULC 0aHCC 0aCOX-2 0aUSP22 0aTumor growth1 aLi, Bo1 aHe, Jintao1 aZeng, Yijun1 aZhang, Yan1 aHe, Fengtian0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2017, dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2017.06.1033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02679naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003100147245016200178300001600340520109700356592002801453650004501481650001801526650001701544650001001561650002701571650001701598650003101615650001501646650001501661650002201676650002001698650001401718650001401732653001701746653001401763653001401777653001401791653002001805700003501825700002801860700002701888700002901915700003001944773012101974856008102095852000902176655001202185IND60549549720221118001501.0190318e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054954972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2016.08.0512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ada Costa, Guilherme Mamede10aEffect of ascorbic acid or oligofructose supplementation on L. paracasei viability, physicochemical characteristics and acceptance of probiotic orange juice  ap. 195-201.  aThis study aimed to evaluate the effect of oligofructose (prebiotic) or ascorbic acid supplementation on the viability of Lactobacillus paracasei ssp. paracasei probiotic culture, physicochemical characteristics and acceptance of orange juice during cold storage (4 °C for 28 days).

It is possible to develop synbiotic orange juice added oligofructose (prebiotic) and probiotic cultures without changing the physicochemical characteristics and acceptance of pure juice and that may be cold stored for 28 days.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei 3aascorbic acid 3acold storage 3acolor 3afructooligosaccharides 3aorange juice 3aphysicochemical properties 3aprebiotics 3aprobiotics 3aprotective effect 3astorage quality 3aturbidity 3aviability 0aOrange juice 0aProbiotic 0aPrebiotic 0aVitamin C 0aCitrus sinensis1 ade Carvalho Silva, José Vitor1 aMingotti, Jéssica Dias1 aBarão, Carlos Eduardo1 aKlososki, Suellen Jensen1 aPimentel, Tatiana Colombo0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2017 Jan., v. 75 p.195-201dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2016.08.0513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03184naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002800151245014500179300001600324520138400340592002801724650002201752650001701774650001101791650001701802650001301819650001601832650001001848650001201858650001501870650001001885650001301895650001301908650002201921650001101943650002701954650002001981650001402001653000902015653000802024653000702032653000802039653000702047653000802054653000702062653000902069653000902078653000802087653000802095653001702103653003902120653001602159653001302175653002902188653002702217700002102244700002502265700002402290773011302314856008602427852000902513655001202522IND50069659920221120115512.0190408e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006965992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.indcrop.2013.08.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDhillon, Gurpreet Singh10aIntegrated process for fungal citric acid fermentation using apple processing wastes and sequential extraction of chitosan from waste stream  ap. 346-351.  aThe present study was carried out to explore the possibility of extracting chitosan (CTS) from waste fungal mycelium as co-product during citric acid (CA) fermentation. CA biosynthesis was carried out through solid-state (SSF) and submerged fermentation (SmF) in lab scale fermenters using apple pomace (AP) and apple pomace ultrafiltration sludge (APS) by Aspergillus niger NRRL 567. CA production of 182.8±8.2 and 294.2±13.2g/kg dried AP and 18.4±1.24 and 40.3±2.0g/L APS was achieved through SSF and SmF after 120h and 132h fermentation period, respectively in control and in treatment with methanol as an inducer.The resulting waste fungal biomass during CA production was used for CTS extraction using ambient conditions. Extractable CTS was found to be higher in control (treatment with no inducer) with 6.40% and 5.13% of dried fungal mycelium resulting from the SSF and SmF, respectively as compared to treatments supplemented with inducers (ethanol and methanol). Degree of deacetylation of the CTS ranged from 78 to 86% for fungal biomass obtained from SSF and SmF. The viscosity of fungal CTS was in a range of 1.02–1.18Pas−1, comparable to the commercial crab shell CTS. The study indicated the possibility of sequential extraction of superior quality CTS from waste fungal biomass resulting from various fungal-based biotechnological industries including CA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus niger 3aapple pomace 3aapples 3abiosynthesis 3achitosan 3acitric acid 3acrabs 3aethanol 3afermenters 3afungi 3aindustry 3amethanol 3amicrobial biomass 3asludge 3asubmerged fermentation 3aultrafiltration 3aviscosity 0aAAIM 0aAIM 0aAP 0aAPS 0aCA 0aCTS 0aDD 0aEtOH 0aMeOH 0aSmF 0aSSF 0aApple pomace 0aApple pomaceultrafiltration sludge 0aCitric acid 0achitosan 0aSolid-state fermentation 0aSubmerged fermentation1 aSurindara Kaura,1 aSarma, Saurabh Jyoti1 aBrar, Satinder Kaur0 tIndustrial crops and products.g2013 Oct., v. 50 p.346-351dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49222x0926-66907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2013.08.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02533naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245010000173520139700273592002801670650001101698650002101709650001501730650002201745650002101767650001001788650001301798650001401811650001201825653001501837653002101852653001901873653001101892653001901903700001701922773011301939856008602052852000902138655001202147IND60719502220221118133404.0220103e20210301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071950222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1253372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTreutwein, Regina10aSetting the agenda for food waste prevention – A perspective on local government policymaking  aFood waste prevention has gained greater relevance on the political agenda over the last decade. However, the involvement of municipal actors in pushing the issue forward has been comparatively limited. Based on the cases of the German cities of Munich and Cologne, this paper examines the possible approaches to prevent food waste at the municipal level and their relevance on the local agenda. It first proposes a definition of local food waste prevention policies and presents an overview of options for municipal actors. Based on the analysis of own interview data and secondary sources, it then applies Kingdon’s Multiple Streams Framework to gain insights on the agenda-setting processes in the two cities concerning the issue. The results suggest that policy entrepreneurs, a strategic framing, and networking with other political levels favour the rise of food waste prevention on the local agenda. The main hindering factors identified are problem load and budgetary constraints, as well as the lack of strong political interest groups and a perceived spatial mismatch between problem and solutions. The findings provide starting points for (i) the further investigation of the so far under-researched potentials and limitations of municipal food waste prevention as well as for (ii) local (network) activities which strengthen food waste prevention on the level of municipalities.  aPublisher supplied data 3acities 3aentrepreneurship 3afood waste 3aissues and policy 3alocal government 3apaper 3apolitics 3asolutions 3astreams 0aFood waste 0aWaste prevention 0aMunicipalities 0aPolicy 0aAgenda setting1 aLangen, Nina0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 Mar. 01, v. 286 p.125337-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1253373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02370naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245008300166520127500249592002801524650001701552650001401569650001401583650001801597650001201615650003501627650001301662651001201675653002001687653002201707653001801729653000801747700001501755700002101770773011101791856008501902852000901987655001201996IND60770204120221121114927.0220328e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077020412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.forpol.2022.1027172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGöhrs, Max10aPolitical parties as allies for the forestry sector: A case study from Germany  aThis paper aims at shedding light on partisan differences in forest policy by analysing whether governing parties' policy outputs are strongly orientated towards the demands of the nature conservation or the forestry sector. The data base encompasses four forest-related issues, relevant from 2001 to 2018 in the 16 German Bundesländer, so that more than 50 cabinets were able to be considered for analysis. The application of Qualitative Comparative Analysis allowed testing for several variables that were expected to have an impact on or even dominate partisan effects in certain configurations. The findings show that political parties do matter in forest policy. While the Green Party's policy outputs are clearly orientated towards nature conservation demands, the Christian Democratic Union/ Christian Social Union is a suitable ally for the forestry sector. The Social Democrats are between these two extremes, but closer to nature conservation in highly populated Bundesländer. Factors like forest cover or share of private forests were revealed not to be as important as political parties. We conclude that research in forest policy missed an important political factor of forest policy by neglecting the influence of political parties as a research subject.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3adatabases 3aeconomics 3aforest policy 3aforests 3anatural resources conservation 3apolitics 3aGermany 0aPartisan theory 0aPolitical parties 0aForest policy 0aQCA1 aKrott, Max1 aHubo, Christiane0 tForest policy and economics.g2022 May, v. 138 p.102717-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl64120x1389-93417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.forpol.2022.1027173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02659naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245007700172300001800249500001900267520149600286592002801782650001701810650001601827650002001843650001401863650001701877650001601894650001201910650001201922650002101934650001801955700002801973700006102001773013202062856008202194852000902276655001202285IND60741403420221121085902.0210612e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074140342DNAL7 a10.1007/s13197-020-04761-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDhanshetty, Manisha10aDecontamination of aflatoxin B1 in peanuts using various cooking methods  ap. 2547-2554.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPeanut and its processed products are recurrently contaminated with aflatoxins (AFs) which are of potential public health concern. Among the different types of AFs, Aflatoxin B1 (B1) is the most frequently detected in peanuts over the maximum level (ML), and thus has warranted considerable research interest in the domain of food safety. In this study, we investigated the decontamination of B1 in three naturally-incurred lots (4, 12, and 40 µg/kg) of peanuts by a range of cooking treatments, including frying, pressure cooking, and roasting. B1 concentrations were determined by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography- fluorescence detection. The method provided a limit of quantification of 0.25 µg/kg for B1, which was much lower than any of its national and international MLs. The recoveries of B1 in fresh and cooked peanuts (positive-control) were in the range of 90–100%. Overall, all the cooking methods demonstrated a significant reduction in B1 loads. The degree to which the processing methods reduced the B1 content followed the pattern: roasting with a combination of NaCl and citric acid > pressure-cooking with a combination of NaCl and citric acid > frying. As the cooking procedures did not involve any complicated steps or sophisticated equipment, these could be readily adopted for decontamination or reduction in the level of B1 for a safer consumption of peanuts at the household level without affecting the organoleptic properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaflatoxin B1 3acitric acid 3adecontamination 3aequipment 3afluorescence 3afood safety 3aliquids 3apeanuts 3apressure cooking 3apublic health1 aElliott, Christopher T.1 aBanerjee, Kaushik1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5026-23700 tJournal of food science and technology.g2021 July, v. 58, no. 7 p.2547-2554dSpringer IndiawJournal:jnl16929x0022-11557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13197-020-04761-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03604naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245010400174300001600278520212300294592002802417650001302445650000802458650002602466650001402492650002202506650001402528650002002542650001902562650001602581650001902597650001502616651001002631653003802641653002602679653002102705653003002726653002702756653003702783700002402820700001602844700001602860700001502876700001902891773010402910856008703014852000903101655001203110IND60567467020221120211444.0180904e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056746702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosenv.2017.04.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlonso-Blanco, E.10aAerosol particle shrinkage event phenomenology in a South European suburban area during 2009–2015  ap. 154-164.  aA high number of aerosol particle shrinkage cases (70) have been identified and analyzed from an extensive and representative database of aerosol size distributions obtained between 2009 and 2015 at an urban background site in Madrid (Spain). A descriptive classification based on the process from which the shrinkage began is proposed according which shrinkage events were divided into three groups: (1) NPF + shrinkage (NPF + S) events, (2) aerosol particle growth process + shrinkage (G + S) events, and (3) pure shrinkage (S) events. The largest number of shrinkages corresponded to the S-type followed by NPF + S, while the G + S events were the least frequent group recorded. Duration of shrinkages varied widely from 0.75 to 8.5 h and SR from −1.0 to −11.1 nm h⁻¹. These processes typically occurred in the afternoon, around 18:00 UTC, caused by two situations: i) a wind speed increase usually associated with a change in the wind direction (over 60% of the observations) and ii) the reduction of photochemical activity at the end of the day. All shrinkages were detected during the warm period, mainly between May and August, when local meteorological conditions (high solar irradiance and temperature and low relative humidity), atmospheric processes (high photochemical activity) and availability of aerosol-forming precursors were favorable for their development. As a consequence of these processes, the particles concentration corresponding to the Aitken mode decreased into the nucleation mode. The accumulation mode did not undergo significant changes during these processes. In some cases, a dilution of the particulate content in the ambient air was observed. This work, goes further than others works dealing with aerosol particles shrinkages, as it incorporates as a main novelty a classification methodology for studying these processes. Moreover, compared to other studies, it is supported by a high and representative number of observations. Thus, this study contributes to get a better understanding of this type of atmospheric aerosol transformations and its features.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3aair 3aatmospheric chemistry 3adatabases 3arelative humidity 3ashrinkage 3asolar radiation 3asuburban areas 3atemperature 3awind direction 3awind speed 3aSpain 0aAerosol particle shrinkage events 0aAerosol particle size 0aAerosol dynamics 0aAerosol size distribution 0aNew particle formation 0aScanning mobility particle sizer1 aGómez-Moreno, F.J.1 aNúñez, L.1 aPujadas, M.1 aCusack, M.1 aArtíñano, B.0 tAtmospheric environment.g2017 July, v. 160 p.154-164dElsevier LtdwJournal:12031x1352-23107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2017.04.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02479naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245008800165300001800253500001900271520118000290592002801470596005901498650001501557650001101572650001001583650001501593650001801608650002401626650001101650650001801661650001501679700002001694700001501714700001601729700001601745700001501761700005801776773013201834856008201966852000902048655001202057IND60741403620221121062630.0210612e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074140362DNAL7 a10.1007/s13197-020-04759-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheng, Yimei10aEffect of three different proteases on horsemeat tenderness during postmortem aging  ap. 2528-2537.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn this study, the semitendinosus of horse meat was used as the raw material. The study assessed the variation of the tenderness of horse meat during postmortem aging through the injection of papain, bromelain and fungal protease. The cooking loss of the horse meat became worse during postmortem aging. Low concentration of protease improved water retention properties of horse meat. Papain, bromelain and fungal protease had significant influence on MFI and shear force. MFI increased obviously but the shear force decreased significantly with the addition of more protease (p <0.05). During postmortem aging, many small molecules popeptide appeared in treatment group. Myosin light chain 2, 20 KDa, 32 KDa and 75 KDa bands appeared at first, however later they disappeared in the group with high concentration of protease treatment in addition to the disappearance of Desmin and Troponin I. The muscle fiber, perimysium and endomysium were degraded because of papain, bromelain and fungal protease treatment. More muscle fiber fragments appeared during postmortem aging.Thus, the tenderness and eating quality of horse meat were improved by adding three kinds of protease.  aPublisher supplied data  a31660440cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3abromelains 3adesmin 3afungi 3ahorse meat 3amuscle fibers 3amyosin light chains 3apapain 3araw materials 3atroponin I1 aJiang, Xiaofeng1 aXue, Yufei1 aQi, Fengmin1 aDai, Zhiwei1 aGuan, Dong1 aKong, Lingming1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3514-43650 tJournal of food science and technology.g2021 July, v. 58, no. 7 p.2528-2537dSpringer IndiawJournal:jnl16929x0022-11557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13197-020-04759-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03279naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094024002200134024001900156040001800175100006000193245010800253300001400361506007600375520179300451592002802244506003702272650000802309650002102317650002602338650001902364650001402383650000902397650001802406650001702424650001102441650000902452653001502461653001502476653002202491653001702513700002202530700002302552700002202575773011602597856008702713852000902800655001202809IND60567467120221207131635.0180904e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056746712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosenv.2017.04.0142doi7 aPMC55441372pmcid7 a287815682pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJung, Heejung S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0366-728410aSimultaneously reducing CO2 and particulate exposures via fractional recirculation of vehicle cabin air  ap. 77-88.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPrior studies demonstrate that air recirculation can reduce exposure to nanoparticles in vehicle cabins. However when people occupy confined spaces, air recirculation can lead to carbon dioxide (CO2) accumulation which can potentially lead to deleterious effects on cognitive function. This study proposes a fractional air recirculation system for reducing nanoparticle concentration while simultaneously suppressing CO2 levels in the cabin. Several recirculation scenarios were tested using a custom-programmed HVAC (heat, ventilation, air conditioning) unit that varied the recirculation door angle in the test vehicle. Operating the recirculation system with a standard cabin filter reduced particle concentrations to 1000 particles/cm³, although CO2 levels rose to 3000 ppm. When as little as 25% fresh air was introduced (75% recirculation), CO2 levels dropped to 1000 ppm, while particle concentrations remained below 5000 particles/cm³. We found that nanoparticles were removed selectively during recirculation and demonstrated the trade-off between cabin CO2 concentration and cabin particle concentration using fractional air recirculation. Data showed significant increases in CO2 levels during 100% recirculation. For various fan speeds, recirculation fractions of 50–75% maintained lower CO2 levels in the cabin, while still reducing particulate levels. We recommend fractional recirculation as a simple method to reduce occupants’ exposures to particulate matter and CO2 in vehicles. A design with several fractional recirculation settings could allow air exchange adequate for reducing both particulate and CO2 exposures. Developing this technology could lead to reductions in airborne nanoparticle exposure, while also mitigating safety risks from CO2 accumulation.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aair 3aair conditioning 3aatmospheric chemistry 3acarbon dioxide 3acognition 3aheat 3ananoparticles 3aparticulates 3apeople 3arisk 0aAutomobile 0aFiltration 0aParticle exposure 0aCO2 exposure1 aGrady, Michael L.1 aVictoroff, Tristan1 aMiller, Arthur L.0 tAtmospheric environment.g2017 July, v. 160 p.77-88dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:12031x1352-23107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2017.04.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03195naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002900151245011200180500001400292520177700306592002802083650002102111650001802132650001402150650002702164650001202191650001502203650001502218650001902233650001502252650001002267650001502277650001802292650002302310650001302333650001502346650001402361650001602375653001202391653001002403653001402413653001802427653002502445700002302470773011302493856008602606852000902692655001202701IND60719502720221118133402.0210201e20210125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071950272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1253472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNarayanasarma, Subramani10aEvaluation of lubricant properties of polyolester oil blended with sesame oil-An experimental investigation  aNAL-light  aThe yearly emissions of synthetic oil to the watercourses alarmingly affect the living organisms in the water bodies, lands and affects the entire earth as a harmful pollutant. Oils from the vegetables/seeds are nowadays preferred as base lubricating oil over synthetic oils because of their less toxicity, biodegradability and renewability. Among the agricultural seed oils, sesame oil is one of the major oil produced around the globe and in this work, it is selected because of its variety of advantages reported in various literature and its similar physical properties as that of base polyolester oil. Seven blends were made using sesame oil and polyolester oil and their thermal, rheological, physiochemical, oxidative, corrosive, tribological, foaming, contact angle and ecological properties are studied and compared with that of base oil. The fatty acid profile of oils is found out using GCMS technique. The thermal properties, viscosity and viscosity index, are found to be increasing with the increase in the proportion of sesame oil in the blend. The foaming tendency of all blended lubricants is found to be less than the polyolester oil. The CoF and WSR of the 15POE+25SESO blend are the least when compared to other blends and the base polyolester oil, whereas the contact angle/wettability is found higher for 20POE+20SESO blend. Up to 100 μg per ml of water of 15POE+25SESO blend is found to be least toxic to the microorganisms and all the blends were biodegradable as the proportion of sesame oil in the blend increased. Hence as a lubricant, 15POE+25SESO blend is the best alternative for conventional POE oil in terms of thermal, rheological, oxidative, nature-friendly, foaming, wettability and tribological properties in a refrigerant compressor.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodegradability 3acontact angle 3aemissions 3afatty acid composition 3afoaming 3aliterature 3alubricants 3amicroorganisms 3apollutants 3aseeds 3asesame oil 3asurface water 3athermal properties 3atoxicity 3avegetables 3aviscosity 3awettability 0aPOE oil 0aBlend 0aTribology 0aBio lubricant 0aThermal conductivity1 aKuzhiveli, Biju T.0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 Jan. 25, v. 281 p.125347-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1253473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03011naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245011700165300001800282520157300300592002801873650001301901650001601914650001801930650001101948650001601959650001901975650002201994650001602016650001702032650000902049650001702058650001902075650004402094650003002138650002002168650002902188700001202217700001902229700001802248700001702266700002102283700002002304773011002324856008602434852000902520655001202529IND60560934920221121155849.0170118e20170117xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056093492DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.6b021072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Sujin10aCarbon Isotopomer Analysis with Non-Unifom Sampling HSQC NMR for Cell Extract and Live Cell Metabolomics Studies  ap. 1078-1085.  aIsotopomer analysis using either ¹³C NMR or LC/GC–MS has been an invaluable tool for studying metabolic activities in a variety of systems. Traditional challenges are, however, that ¹³C-detected NMR is insensitive despite its high resolution, and that MS-based techniques cannot easily differentiate positional isotopomers. In addition, current ¹³C NMR or LC/GC–MS has limitations in detecting metabolites in living cells. Here, we describe a non-uniform sampling-based 2D heteronuclear single quantum coherence (NUS HSQC) approach to measure metabolic isotopomers in both cell lysates and living cells. The method provides a high resolution that can resolve multiplet structures in the ¹³C dimension while retaining the sensitivity of the ¹H-indirect detection. The approach was tested in L1210 mouse leukemia cells labeled with ¹³C acetate by measuring NUS HSQC with 25% sampling density. The results gave a variety of metabolic information such as (1) higher usage of acetate in acetylation pathway than aspartate synthesis, (2) TCA cycle efficiency changes upon the inhibition of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation by pharmacological agents, and (3) position-dependent isotopomer patterns in fatty acids in living cells. In addition, we were able to detect fatty acids along with other hydrophilic molecules in one sample of live cells without extraction. Overall, the high sensitivity and resolution along with the application to live cells should make the NUS HSQC approach attractive in studying carbon flux information in metabolic studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetates 3aacetylation 3aaspartic acid 3acarbon 3afatty acids 3ahydrophilicity 3ametabolic studies 3ametabolites 3ametabolomics 3amice 3amitochondria 3aneoplasm cells 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aoxidative phosphorylation 3astable isotopes 3atricarboxylic acid cycle1 aWen, He1 aAn, Yŏng-jin,1 aCha, Jin Wook1 aKo, Yoon-Joo1 aHyberts, Sven G.1 aPark, Sunghyouk0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2017 Jan. 17, v. 89, no. 2 p.1078-1085dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.analchem.6b021073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03083naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005800151245015200209520164800361592002802009650001702037650001902054650001602073650001102089650002002100650001202120650002902132650001302161650002102174650001102195650000902206651001002215651001102225651001402236653002102250653001902271653001702290653001202307653002402319653001902343700001802362700002502380773011302405856008602518852000902604655001202613IND60719502820221118133424.0220103e20210415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071950282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1253482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalah, Wael A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6091-241014aThe key role of sustainable renewable energy technologies in facing shortage of energy supplies in Palestine: Current practice and future potential  aRenewable and sustainable energy technologies can play a major rule in Palestine due to its dependability and security. Some facts about the electricity and potential clean sources were discussed in this study based on the challenges faced Palestinian to develop those sources. It was found that energy sector in Palestinian is highly deepening on imports from others. Accordingly, a comprehensive study focusing into the current energy situation and potential development is needed. Renewable energy status and the availability by its main types including, wind, solar, thermal, and biomass energies were critically reviewed and discussed in this study.The results indicated that the main portion of 93.87% of electrical energy supply purchased from the Israeli Electrical Corporation (93.87), another 2.03% purchased from Jordan and Egypt, and only 4.1% generated locally. Nevertheless, only 166,902 MWh (2.63%) of electricity produced from renewable source of energy out of the 6,336,185 MWh generated in 2018. Not surprisingly, around 75% of the entire electricity is consumed by building sector which is classified as the first consumer of electricity within Palestine. Fortunately, within the last 5 years, 6 PV solar panel projects were established to generate electricity for private and public sectors with a total capacity of 10.6 MWp. It can be concluded that there is an essential need to adopt a new action plan aims at addressing energy independency and sustainability. There is a need to accelerates more research and investment in renewable energy sector to use hybrid energy system which can offer a better grid stability.  aPublisher supplied data 3acorporations 3aelectric power 3aelectricity 3aenergy 3aenergy industry 3aimports 3arenewable energy sources 3aresearch 3asolar collectors 3asupply 3awind 3aEgypt 3aJordan 3aPalestine 0aRenewable energy 0aEnergy balance 0aSolar energy 0aBiomass 0aGovernment practice 0aSustainability1 aAbuhelwa, Mai1 aBashir, Mohammed JK.0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 Apr. 15, v. 293 p.125348-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1253483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03346naa a2200865 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245011300170500002200283520127900305592002801584650002101612650001801633650002501651650001601676650001201692650002401704650001001728650001301738650001201751650001001763650002001773650001101793650000901804650001301813650002101826653000801847653000801855653000901863653001201872653001201884653001201896653001101908653000801919653000701927653000901934653000901943653000801952653000901960653000901969653001001978653001001988653000801998653000902006653000902015653001002024653001002034653000902044653001002053653000802063653000802071653000902079653001302088653001302101653001202114653001202126653000902138653002402147653001602171653001002187653001302197700002002210700001902230700003502249700001602284700002202300773005602322856008102378852000902459655001202468IND60564565120221117005930.0170713s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056456512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tox.2017.03.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDreval, Kostiantyn10amiR-1247 blocks SOX9–mediated regeneration in alcohol- and fibrosis-associated acute kidney injury in mice  aPre-press version  aExcessive alcohol consumption has a significant impact on human health and is a major public health problem worldwide. One of the consequences of long-term excessive alcohol consumption is cellular injury in almost all organs and tissues, with acute kidney injury (AKI) being one of the most common pathological manifestations. In the present study, using a mouse model of alcoholic liver fibrosis-associated AKI induced by a combined treatment with carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) and ethanol and resembling pathological features of AKI in human alcoholic liver fibrosis, we demonstrate alterations in histone modifications in the kidneys and, importantly, in the promoter region of the over-expressed SRY (sex determining region Y)-box 9 (Sox9) gene. The level of SOX9 protein in the kidneys of AKI-mice is reduced and correlates inversely with increased expression of microRNA miR-1247. Mechanistically, the over-expression of miR-1247 is associated with a markedly increased in histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation in the upstream region of the Mir1247 gene. The results of the present study demonstrate a functional role of epigenetic mechanisms in AKI and indicate the importance of correcting the epigenetic dysregulation for the proper renal tubule maintenance and repair.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalcohol drinking 3aanimal models 3acarbon tetrachloride 3aepigenetics 3aethanol 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3ahistones 3akidneys 3aliver 3aliver cirrhosis 3alysine 3amice 3amicroRNA 3apromoter regions 0aNBT 0aCpG 0aBCIP 0aH4K16ac 0aH3K27ac 0aH3K56ac 0aH3K9ac 0aAKI 0aAP 0aCCl4 0aChIP 0aDIG 0aDnmt 0aEtOH 0aGAPDH 0aHavcr 0aHRP 0aKim1 0aLcn2 0aMeDIP 0amiRNA 0aNgal 0aANOVA 0aPBS 0aSSC 0aSox9 0aH4K20me3 0aH3K27me3 0aH3K4me3 0aH3K9me3 0aACTB 0aAcute kidney injury 0aepigenetics 0aSOX-9 0amiR-12471 ade Conti, Aline1 aFuruya, Shinji1 aBeland, F.

Municipal leaders are responsible for the maintenance of PUGS. However, current evidence identifies limited knowledge about urban green infrastructure governance since the lack of data about PUGS is the main obstacle to effective intervention. Set against this background, this study aimed to identify clusters of ecosystem services potential in 25 PUGS in the city of Porto, Portugal, through a validated tool application. Multivariate techniques allowed identifying predictor dimensions of ecosystem services potential: the environmental quality and facilities. Five PUGS clusters were validated: i) Environmentally Empowered and Socially Expectant Spaces, ii) Socioenvironmentally Empowered Spaces, iii) Environmentally Empowered but Socially Un-dynamic Spaces, iv) Socioenvironmentally Disempowered Spaces, and v) Socioenvironmentally Unexplored Spaces. This typology proposal brings to the discussion a possible solution for better qualifying these spaces, as it complements PUGS type with a socioeconomic and environmental characterisation. Furthermore, these results are useful in the design of place-based intervention in PUGS, contributing to the increase of ecosystem services potential and improving urban environment quality and sustainability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental quality 3agovernance 3agreen infrastructure 3aissues and policy 3aurban areas 3aPortugal 0aPublic urban green spaces 0aEcosystem services potential 0aPlace-based interventions 0aPUGS1 aDias, Ricardo Cunha1 aTeixeira, Catarina Patoilo1 aFernandes, Cláudia Oliveira1 aLeal Filho, Walter,1 aBarros, Nelson1 aMaia, Rui Leandro0 tEnvironmental science & policy.g2022 June, v. 132 p.262-272dElsevier LtdwJournal:12413x1462-90117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envsci.2022.03.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02933naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245008300173300001600256520161000272592002801882650002501910650001101935650002001946650001201966650001501978650001301993650001002006650002302016650001202039650002502051650002002076650002102096650001502117651001202132651001102144653002802155653001702183653002502200653001102225653001402236700001702250773010102267856008602368852000902454655001202463IND60609304520221120160945.0200705e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060930452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anbehav.2018.07.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSolomon, Nancy G.10aDispatches from the field: sociality and reproductive success in prairie voles  ap. 193-203.  aOne way to characterize sociality is by the type and variability of social organization exhibited by individuals within populations. Social unit size and composition can result in costs and benefits to female group members, which may affect their reproductive success. We tested this hypothesis using data from two natural populations of prairie voles, Microtus ochrogaster, that live in habitats differing in the distribution of vegetation and in population density. During short-term investigations of populations in Indiana and Kansas (4–8 weeks), we detected significant differences between populations in the type of social units in which adult females resided, with most adult females in Kansas living as single females, whereas in Indiana most females resided in groups. However, neither social unit size nor composition was related to female reproductive success in either population. When we studied the same Indiana population for 15 weeks, the length of time that females were detected on the study grid or were residents at a nest predicted the number of offspring they produced. In addition, the number of offspring produced by females tended to decrease with group size, although this relationship was not statistically significant. Finally, social unit size was not significantly related to the amount of time females were detected in the population. Our results suggest that females do not obtain increased direct or indirect fitness by living in larger groups. Rather, persistence and residency status of females in the population are the best predictors of female reproductive success.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMicrotus ochrogaster 3aadults 3aanimal behavior 3afemales 3agroup size 3ahabitats 3anests 3apopulation density 3aprogeny 3areproductive success 3asocial behavior 3asocial structure 3avegetation 3aIndiana 3aKansas 0aintraspecific variation 0aprairie vole 0areproductive success 0arodent 0asociality1 aKeane, Brian0 tAnimal behaviour.g2018 Sept., v. 143 p.193-203dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45841x0003-34727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2018.07.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03101naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245010200158520207300260592002802333650005102361650001402412650002402426650001102450650001902461650001502480650001702495700001602512700001802528700001702546773012802563856007502691852000902766655001202775IND60703887220221117164649.0200721e20200317xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070388722DNAL7 a10.3390/rs120609722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheng, Yinyi 10aBig Earth Observation Data Integration in Remote Sensing Based on a Distributed Spatial Framework  aThe arrival of the era of big data for Earth observation (EO) indicates that traditional data management models have been unable to meet the needs of remote sensing data in big data environments. With the launch of the first remote sensing satellite, the volume of remote sensing data has also been increasing, and traditional data storage methods have been unable to ensure the efficient management of large amounts of remote sensing data. Therefore, a professional remote sensing big data integration method is sorely needed. In recent years, the emergence of some new technical methods has provided effective solutions for multi-source remote sensing data integration. This paper proposes a multi-source remote sensing data integration framework based on a distributed management model. In this framework, the multi-source remote sensing data are partitioned by the proposed spatial segmentation indexing (SSI) model through spatial grid segmentation. The designed complete information description system, based on International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 19115, can explain multi-source remote sensing data in detail. Then, the distributed storage method of data based on MongoDB is used to store multi-source remote sensing data. The distributed storage method is physically based on the sharding mechanism of the MongoDB database, and it can provide advantages for the security and performance of the preservation of remote sensing data. Finally, several experiments have been designed to test the performance of this framework in integrating multi-source remote sensing data. The results show that the storage and retrieval performance of the distributed remote sensing data integration framework proposed in this paper is superior. At the same time, the grid level of the SSI model proposed in this paper also has an important impact on the storage efficiency of remote sensing data. Therefore, the remote storage data integration framework, based on distributed storage, can provide new technical support and development prospects for big EO data.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternational Organization for Standardization 3adatabases 3ainformation storage 3amodels 3aremote sensing 3asatellites 3aspatial data1 aZhou, Kefa 1 aWang, Jinlin 1 aYan, Jining 0 tRemote Sensing.g2020 Mar. 17, v. 12, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs120609723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02567naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245010600164300001600270520135700286592002801643650001201671650001301683650001401696650001301710650001201723650001901735650002601754650002001780650000901800650001601809650001501825650001101840651002101851700002601872700001701898700001901915773013301934856008102067852000902148655001202157IND60615243120221122023804.0181009e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061524312DNAL7 a10.1007/s00704-017-2265-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDimri, A. P.10aComparison of climatic trends and variability among glacierized environments in the Western Himalayas  ap. 155-163.  aThe climate and hydrology of the Western Himalayas is complex and a function of snow and glacier melt, land use, topography, and Indian summer and winter monsoon dynamics. Improving our knowledge about these processes is important from societal and agricultural points of view. In this study, an observational analysis is carried out to assess the changing climatic trends and the associated interannual variability in winter temperature and precipitation at three glacierized regions of Western Himalayas having distinctly different sub-regional characteristics. In situ observations of 23 years (1985–2007) are used. These observations are passed through rigorous statistical quality control checks. Results show higher interannual variability with increasing temperature trends in the glacierized regions of the Siachen (Karakoram Range) and Chotasigri (Great Himalayan Range). Karakoram Range has higher warming trends than the Great Himalayan Range. In case of precipitation, an overall decrease in precipitation is observed with contrasting trends in the last decade. Nino3.4 index is positively correlated with winter precipitation with similar interannual variability. In addition, at Siachen temperature and precipitation show strong negative correlation, and precipitation to spell length correlation is opposite at Siachen and Chotasigri.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3aglaciers 3ahydrology 3aland use 3amelting 3amonsoon season 3aobservational studies 3aquality control 3asnow 3atemperature 3atopography 3awinter 3aHimalayan region1 aImmerzeel, Walter W.,1 aSalzmann, N.1 aThayyen, R.

The environmental risk assessment for such commercial mixtures applies as default the concept of concentration addition. There is remaining regulatory concern, however, that underestimation of risks can occur if components in the mixture interact synergistically, i.e., elicit effects greater than those predicted by concentration addition. While cases of true synergism appear to be rare, the combination of substances targeting different steps in the same biosynthesis pathway was pointed out as one potential case of synergistic interaction although mechanistic explanations are lacking. The present study aimed to verify this hypothesis using the green alga Raphidocelis subcapitata as the regulatory standard test organism for which such synergism had been indicated earlier. Algal growth inhibition tests were conducted with mixtures of ergosterol biosynthesis inhibitors (tebuconazole, fenpropidin, and fenpropimorph). The fungicides were first tested individually to derive reliable data for a mixture toxicity prediction. The here determined toxicity estimates for two of the fungicides were considerably lower than the endpoints in the regulatory dossiers, which had been used for earlier mixture toxicity predictions. Experimentally observed toxicity estimates for the mixtures deviated <2.6-fold from the predicted values. Hence, the hypothesis of synergistic interaction between fungicides targeting different enzymes in the ergosterol biosynthesis was clearly not confirmed for the green alga R. subcapitata. Overall, the present study demonstrates the importance of reliable and correct input data for mixture toxicity predictions in order to avoid erroneous conclusions on non-additive (synergistic) interactions.  aPublisher supplied data  aFKZ 3713 64 417cGerman Federal Environment Agency 3aSelenastrum capricornutum 3aactive ingredients 3aadditives 3aalgae 3abiocides 3abiosynthesis 3aenvironmental assessment 3aenzymes 3aergosterol 3afenpropimorph 3agrowth retardation 3aplant protection 3aprediction 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3asynergism 3atebuconazole 3atoxicity 3atoxicity testing1 aVollmar, Pia1 aSacher, Frank1 aKehrer, Anja0 tEcotoxicology.g2018 Sept., v. 27, no. 7 p.936-944dSpringer USwJournal:jnl3870048x0963-92927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10646-018-1917-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02127naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245009300158300002000251520104900271592002801320650001901348650002001367650001401387650002301401650003001424650002101454650001601475650001201491650001501503700001801518700001501536773014301551856007401694852000901768655001201777IND60644611120221117233603.0190517e20190515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064461112DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ta01188a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Jin-Hang10aElectrocatalytic reduction of CO₂ by two-dimensional transition metal porphyrin sheets  ap. 11944-11952.  aLooking for highly stable and efficient electrocatalysts for CO₂ reduction is quite crucial, but a big challenge in community. In this paper, the catalytic performance of the first transition metal series–porphyrin (TM–PP) monolayers as single atom catalysts for the electrochemical reduction of CO₂ has been studied using density functional theory. The results show that the TM–PP monolayers have excellent catalytic stability and CO₂ electrochemical reduction selectivity. The primary reduction product of Sc–PP, Mn–PP and Ni–PP is CO, the primary reduction product of Ti–PP and V–PP is CH₄, and the primary reduction product of the other five monolayers is HCOOH. Ti–PP, V–PP, Ni–PP, and Cu–PP have an overpotential >0.7 V, while the overpotentials of the other monolayers are all less than 0.5 V. In particular, the overpotentials for Mn–PP and Co–PP are very low (∼0.13 V). Therefore, TM–PP monolayers are promising systems for experimental research on electrochemical catalysts for CO₂ reduction.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon monoxide 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3adensity functional theory 3aelectrochemistry 3aformic acid 3amethane 3aporphyrins1 aYang, Liming,1 aGanz, Eric0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2019 May 15, v. 7, no. 19 p.11944-11952dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ta01188a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02778naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006200148245012400210300002000334520140600354592002801760650002601788650001901814650001901833650002501852650001101877650001601888650001401904650000901918650001301927650001601940650002501956651001001981700002001991700001502011700001702026700001802043700001602061700002002077773015502097856008302252852000902335655001202344IND60765842120221122115851.0220203e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076584212DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-021-16751-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChandio, Abbas Ali1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8706-968110aModeling the impact of climatic and non-climatic factors on cereal production: evidence from Indian agricultural sector  ap. 14634-14653.  aThe underpinned study examines the effects of climatic and non-climatic factors on Indian agriculture, cereal production, and yield using the country-level time series data of 1965–2015. With the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) bounds testing approach, the long-term equilibrium association among the variables has been explored. The results reveal that climatic factors like CO₂ emissions and temperature adversely affect agricultural output, while rainfall positively affects it. Likewise, non-climatic factors, including energy used, financial development, and labor force, affect agricultural production positively in the long run. The estimated long-run results further demonstrate that CO₂ emissions and rainfall positively affect both cereal production and yield, while temperature adversely affects them. The results exhibit that the cereal cropped area, energy used, financial development, and labor force significantly and positively impact the long-run cereal production and yield. Finally, pairwise Granger causality test confirmed that both climatic and non-climatic factors are significantly influencing agriculture and cereal production in India. Based on these results, policymakers and governmental institutions should formulate coherent adaptation measures and mitigation policies to tackle the adverse climate change effects on agriculture and its production of cereals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural industry 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate change 3aeconomic development 3aenergy 3alabor force 3apollution 3arain 3aresearch 3atemperature 3atime series analysis 3aIndia1 aJiang, Yuansheg1 aAmin, Asad1 aAkram, Waqar1 aOzturk, Ilhan1 aSinha, Avik1 aMalang, Bhoral,0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2022 Feb., v. 29, no. 10 p.14634-14653dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-16751-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02460naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003300113040001800146100002200164245016800186300001800354520141100372592002801783650001801811650000901829650002201838650001701860650001601877700002101893700001801914700002001932700001801952773009701970856004602067852000902113655001202122IND50089483520221119091605.0140509e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008948352DNAL7 a247879012pmid7 a10.1111/1750-3841.123882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChon, Jung‐Whan10aEvaluation of Potassium‐Clavulanate‐Supplemented Modified Charcoal‐Cefoperazone‐Deoxycholate Agar for Enumeration of Campylobacter in Chicken Carcass Rinse  ap.

The quantitative detection of viable Campylobacter cells from a pure culture, plated on C‐mCCDA, is statistically similar (P > 0.05) to mCCDA. In total, 120 chickens were rinsed using 400 mL buffered peptone water. The rinses were inoculated onto C‐mCCDA and mCCDA followed by incubation at 42 °C for 48 h. There was no statistical difference between C‐mCCDA (45 of 120 plates; mean count, 145.5 CFU/mL) and normal mCCDA (46 of 120 plates; mean count, 160.8 CFU/mL) in the isolation rate and recovery of Campylobacter (P > 0.05) from chicken carcass rinse. The Pearson correlation coefficient value for the number of Campylobacter cells recovered in the 2 media was 0.942. However, the selectivity was much better on C‐mCCDA than on mCCDA plates (P < 0.05). Significantly fewer C‐mCCDA plates (33 out of 120 plates; mean count, 1.9 CFU/mL) were contaminated with non‐Campylobacter cells than the normal mCCDA plates (67 out of 120 plates; mean count, 27.1 CFU/mL). The C‐mCCDA may provide improved results for enumeration of Campylobacter in chicken meat alternative to mCCDA with its increased selectivity the modified agar possess.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCampylobacter 3aagar 3achicken carcasses 3achicken meat 3acorrelation1 aKim, Hong‐Seok1 aKim, Hyunsook1 aOh, Deog‐Hwan1 aSeo, Kun‐Ho0 tJournal of food science.g2014 May, v. 79, no. 5 p.M923-M926dThe Institutex0022-11477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1750-3841.12388  aDNAL 7aarticle03264naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245016600173300001600339520174100355592002802096650002202124650001502146650001302161650001902174650001302193650002402206650001302230650001502243650001402258650001002272650001202282650000902294650001302303650001102316650000902327700002202336700002002358700002202378700002302400700002002423700002302443700002502466700001902491700001902510700002002529773010302549856008502652852000902737655001202746IND60630408520221119071115.0190207e20181002xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063040852DNAL7 a10.1080/00063657.2018.15616462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrambilla, Mattia10aLandscape-associated differences in fine-scale habitat selection modulate the potential impact of climate change on White-winged Snowfinch Montifringilla nivalis  ap. 525-532.  aCapsule: Fine-scale use of climate-sensitive habitats by White-winged Snowfinches Montifringilla nivalis is affected by landscape composition, which thus modulates the potential impact of climate change. Aims: To explore the fine-scale habitat use for foraging by breeding White-winged Snowfinches, with the aim of identifying the potential impacts of climate change on their dependence on habitat characteristics in the wider landscape, which could shape the species’ response to climate change. Pairs mostly relying on snow could be at higher risk due to a decrease in spring snow-cover, but the reliance on snow may be mediated by the presence of alternative habitats in the landscape. Methods: The White-winged Snowfinch uses alpine grassland, snowfields and melting snow margins for capturing prey during nestling rearing and is threatened by earlier snowmelt induced by climate change. We investigated habitat use in 17 Snowfinch pairs in relation to landscape composition within a 300 m buffer around their nests. Results: The use of snowfields and snow-bare margins was positively associated with wind intensity (probably due to greater wind-borne arthropod fallout with wind), and negatively associated with grassland cover (i.e. the main alternative habitat) and date within the season. Conclusions: Fine-scale habitat selection was affected by landscape composition: the availability of patches of alternative habitats decreased the reliance on more climate-sensitive resources, modulating the potential impact of climate change. Coupling assessments of fine-scale resource selection with broader habitat descriptors, which are easier to assess over broader scales, may help understand and predict climate change impacts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalpine grasslands 3aarthropods 3abreeding 3aclimate change 3aforaging 3ahabitat preferences 3ahabitats 3alandscapes 3anestlings 3anests 3arearing 3asnow 3asnowmelt 3aspring 3awind1 aCapelli, Federico1 aAnderle, Matteo1 aForti, Alessandro1 aBazzanella, Marica1 aMasiero, Giulia1 aBogliani, Giuseppe1 aPartel, Piergiovanni1 aPedrini, Paolo1 aPedrotti, Luca1 aScridel, Davide0 tBird study.g2018 Oct. 2, v. 65, no. 4 p.525-532dTaylor & FranciswJournal:11668x1944-67057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00063657.2018.15616463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03489naa a2200769 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245009800164500002200262520162400284592002801908650001801936650001001954650001601964650001301980650002001993650001902013650001902032650001402051650001002065650002002075650001802095650001602113650000902129650001202138650001302150650002002163650003602183653000902219653001002228653000802238653001102246653001102257653001002268653000902278653000802287653000802295653001202303653001002315653000802325653001002333653000802343653000802351653000802359653000902367653000802376653000802384653000802392653001802400653001902418653001002437653002002447700001602467700001802483700001302501700001502514700001302529700001902542773005602561856008102617852000902698655001202707IND60564565420221117005719.0170713s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056456542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tox.2017.03.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBai, Qingyun10aLong-term acetaminophen treatment induced liver fibrosis in mice and the involvement of Egr-1  aPre-press version  aAcetaminophen (APAP)-induced acute liver injury has already been well studied. However, whether long-term administration of APAP will cause liver fibrosis is still not very clear. This study aims to investigate the liver fibrosis in mice induced by long-term APAP treatment and the involvement of early growth response 1 (Egr-1). C57BL/6 mice were orally given with APAP (200, 300mg/kg) for 2, 6 or 10 weeks, respectively. Liver hydroxyproline content, collagen deposition and inflammatory cells infiltration were increased in mice treated with APAP (200, 300mg/kg) for 6 or 10 weeks. Liver mRNA expression of collagen (COL)1a1, Col3a1, transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) and serum contents of COL1, COL3, TGF-β were all increased in APAP-treated mice. Liver expression of α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and phosphorylated ERK1/2 and Smad2/3 were all increased in APAP-treated mice. Furthermore, increased liver mRNA expression of Egr-1 and its subsequent nuclear translocation were found in APAP-treated mice. Egr-1 knock-out mice were further applied. APAP-induced liver fibrosis was found to be more serious in Egr-1 knock-out mice. N-acetyl-p-benzoquinoneimine (NAPQI), the APAP hepatotoxic metabolite, increased cellular mRNA expression of α-SMA, Col1a1, Col3a1, TGF-β, induced ERK1/2 and Smad2/3 phosphorylation and Egr-1 nuclear translocation in hepatic stellate LX2 cells. In conclusion, long-term administration of APAP induced liver fibrosis in mice, and Egr-1 was critically involved in this process. This study points out a warning and reference for patients with long-term APAP ingestion in clinic.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetaminophen 3aactin 3ablood serum 3acollagen 3agene expression 3ahepatotoxicity 3ahydroxyproline 3aingestion 3aliver 3aliver cirrhosis 3amessenger RNA 3ametabolites 3amice 3amuscles 3apatients 3aphosphorylation 3atransforming growth factor beta 0aAPAP 0aEgr-1 0aCOL 0aTGF-β 0aα-SMA 0aNAPQI 0aECMs 0aOTC 0aALF 0aALT/AST 0aELISA 0aERK 0aTALEN 0aH&E 0aFBS 0aSEM 0aTIMP 0aBMP 0aMMP 0aHSC 0aAcetaminophen 0aLiver fibrosis 0aEgr-1 0aHSCs activation1 aYan, Hongyu1 aSheng, Yuchen1 aJin, Yao1 aShi, Liang1 aJi, Lili1 aWang, Zhengtao0 tToxicology.g2017, dElsevier B.V.x0300-483X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tox.2017.03.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03676naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024001900116024003900135040001800174100005700192245006500249300001300314506007600327520188400403592002802287506003702315650002302352650001102375650002602386650002302412650002002435650002402455650002202479650001702501650002202518650001802540650002002558650001102578650001402589650001402603653001702617653001602634653003202650653002002682653001602702653001502718700002002733700002302753700002702776700005802803700001802861700002602879773009802905856008603003852000903089655001203098IND60609304820221207120211.0200705e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060930482DNAL7 aPMC61470502pmcid7 a302455252pmid7 a10.1016/j.anbehav.2018.07.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThorley, Jack1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8426-610X10aNo task specialization among helpers in Damaraland mole-rats  ap. 9-24.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe specialization of individuals in specific behavioural tasks is often attributed either to irreversible differences in development, which generate functionally divergent cooperative phenotypes, or to age-related changes in the relative frequency with which individuals perform different cooperative activities; both of which are common in many insect caste systems. However, contrasts in cooperative behaviour can take other forms and, to date, few studies of cooperative behaviour in vertebrates have explored the effects of age, adult phenotype and early development on individual differences in cooperative behaviour in sufficient detail to discriminate between these alternatives. Here, we used multinomial models to quantify the extent of behavioural specialization within nonreproductive Damaraland mole-rats, Fukomys damarensis, at different ages. We showed that, although there were large differences between individuals in their contribution to cooperative activities, there was no evidence of individual specialization in cooperative activities that resembled the differences found in insect societies with distinct castes where individual contributions to different activities are negatively related to each other. Instead, individual differences in helping behaviour appeared to be the result of age-related changes in the extent to which individuals committed to all forms of helping. A similar pattern is observed in cooperatively breeding meerkats, Suricata suricatta, and there is no unequivocal evidence of caste differentiation in any cooperative vertebrate. The multinomial models we employed offer a powerful heuristic tool to explore task specialization and developmental divergence across social taxa and provide an analytical approach that may be useful in exploring the distribution of different forms of helping behaviour in other cooperative species.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSuricata suricatta 3aadults 3aalloparental behavior 3aanalytical methods 3aanimal behavior 3acaste determination 3acollective action 3acooperatives 3aearly development 3ainsect castes 3ainsect colonies 3amodels 3amole rats 3aphenotype 0aBathyergidae 0aeusociality 0asocial niche specialization 0atask allocation 0atotipotency 0atrade-offs1 aMendonça, Rute1 aVullioud, Philippe1 aTorrents-Ticó, Miquel1 aZöttl, Markus1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5582-23061 aGaynor, David1 aClutton-Brock, T.

An economic decision model was created, allowing individuals to input site and machine-specific parameters into the model. Model output provides data for 2 scenarios. Scenario 1 explores whether a farmer could support this venture by producing bedding for on-farm consumption only. Scenario 2 explores the profit an individual (farmer or nonfarmer) could gain if operating the wood shaving machine for 8 to 40 h/wk throughout the year. Model output for scenario 1 found that the average-sized organic and conventional dairy farm in New England would not be able to support this type of venture. Instead, the breakeven volume of bedding corresponded to farms with greater than 170 cows, indicating that larger farms, or a cooperative of locally clustered small farms using the machine collectively, would have a more favorable payback period. For scenario 2, the payback period was >15 yr if operating 8 h/wk to 561 d if operating 40 h/wk throughout the year. The 15-yr net present value was $159,884 to $1,777,435 and the discounted benefit-cost ratio was 0.8 to 9.3 when operating 8 to 40 h/wk throughout the year. However, if operating 40 h/wk, supply may outweigh demand, as enough bedding could be produced for 30 organic or 25 conventional dairies of average size in the New England region.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3acost benefit analysis 3acows 3adairies 3adairy farming 3aeconomic sustainability 3afarmers 3alitter (bedding) 3amodels 3asmall farms 3awood shavings 3aNew England region 0aanimal bedding production 0awood shaving machine 0ausing low quality and small diameter trees 0awood shavings1 aAber, John D.1 aHoward, Theodore E.0 tProfessional animal scientists.g2017 Dec., v. 33, no. 6 p.771-779dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl56104x1080-74467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.15232/pas.2017-016623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03043naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001900137245015200156300001600308500001900324520154800343592002801891650002001919650002201939650002101961650001601982650001701998650001702015650001102032650001902043650004002062650001602102650001602118653001002134653003302144653000902177653006202186653002602248700001902274700001902293700002102312700002602333700002002359773010202379856007102481852000902552655001202561IND60695712520221121015359.0200518e20161101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069571252DNAL7 a10.2216/16-25.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWatanabe, Yuki10aPhotosynthetic responses of Pyropia yezoensis f. narawaensis (Bangiales, Rhodophyta) to a thermal and PAR gradient vary with the life-history stage  ap. 665-672.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe effect of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and temperature on photosynthesis of the cultivated red alga, Pyropia yezoensis f. narawaensis (Saga-#5 Strain, Bangiales), was determined for microscopic sporophytes and macroscopic gametophytes with pulse-amplitude fluorometry and dissolved oxygen sensors. A clear difference in the temperature response of the maximum quantum yield (Fᵥ/Fₘ) and oxygenic gross photosynthesis (GP) was revealed between the two life-history stages. The sporophyte Fᵥ/Fₘ was not sensitive to temperature, although the model revealed an Fᵥ/Fₘ maximum (0.60) at 16.7°C. In contrast, the gametophyte Fᵥ/Fₘ was clearly sensitive to temperature and attained a maximum mean value of 0.55 at 14.7°C. The relationship between GP and temperature was also different. The maximum rates of GP of the sporophyte occurred at 30.7°C and was 17.1 μg O₂ mgcₕₗ₋ₐ⁻¹ min⁻¹ (15.4–19.4, 95% Bayesian credible interval); however, maximum rates of GP for the gametophyte were much higher (110 μmol O₂ mgcₕₗ₋ₐ⁻¹ min⁻¹) and occurred at a lower temperature (14.4°C). The response of oxygenic net photosynthesis to PAR also varied, and the initial slope (α), the saturation PAR (Eₖ) and the maximum photosynthetic rate (Pₘₐₓ) of the gametophyte were much higher than the sporophyte. Therefore, we hypothesised that in species with a heteromorphic life history, such as those in the genus Pyropia, physiological responses to environmental gradients would be dissimilar.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aPyropia yezoensis 3adissolved oxygen 3afluorometry 3agametophytes 3alife history 3amodels 3aphotosynthesis 3aphotosynthetically active radiation 3asporophytes 3atemperature 0aAlgae 0aHeteromorphic life histories 0aNori 0aPulse amplitude–modulated (PAM)-chlorophyll fluorometry 0aTemperature tolerance1 aYamada, Hideki1 aMine, Takayuki1 aKawamura, Yoshio1 aNishihara, Gregory N.1 aTerada, Ryūta,0 tPhycologia.g2016 Nov. 1, v. 55, no. 6 p.665-672dTaylor & FranciswJournal:1959x2330-29687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2216/16-25.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02229naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005300094040001800147100002100165245011000186300001400296520121100310592002801521653001701549653001701566653001201583653001801595653003101613653004601644700002101690773009401711856011301805852000901918655001201927IND60124952520221116234105.0151031e200605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012495252DNAL7 a10.1658/1402-2001(2006)9[59:COTEPP]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSorrie, Bruce A.10aConservation of the endangered Pinus palustris ecosystem based on Coastal Plain centres of plant endemism  ap. 59-66.  aQuestion: Can the geographic patterning of endemic plant species inform reserve selection in a region of high endemism?Location: The southeastern Coastal Plain of North America, focusing primarily on the imperiled Pinus palustris (longleaf pine) ecosystem.Methods: We documented the high level of plant endemism in the region, and characterized the endemic taxa into distributional subregions.Results: A total of 1630 plant taxa are endemic to the Coastal Plain, a large proportion of which are endemic to phytogeographical subregions within the Coastal Plain, with particularly large numbers of narrow endemics occurring in the East Gulf Coastal Plain and Florida Peninsula.Conclusions: This pattern of local endemism presents challenges in conserving the full biota of the region: a reserve system focusing on few and large conservation areas has theoretical benefits for long-term management and viability, but will fail to capture many local endemics. We propose that the dispersed distribution of endemic species will require a mixture of large core reserves and smaller satellite reserves.Nomenclature: Kartesz (1999) with minor exceptions and modifications and updates from the taxonomic literature.  aPublisher supplied data 0aBiodiversity 0aBiogeography 0aFlorida 0aLongleaf pine 0aMid-Atlantic Coastal Plain 0aSoutheastern North American Coastal Plain1 aWeakley, Alan S.0 tApplied vegetation science.g2006 May, v. 9, no. 1 p.59-66dOpulus Pressx1402-20017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1658%2F1402-2001%282006%299%5B59%3ACOTEPP%5D2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03320naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002800137245010000165300001400265500001900279520186400298592002802162650001502190650001402205650001102219650002402230650001802254650001402272650001402286650002402300651001702324651001502341653002002356653002302376653001802399700002402417700002302441700001702464700002302481700001702504700002402521700003202545700001902577700001902596700001902615773010002634856007102734852000902805655001202814IND60695712720221121062015.0200518e20170101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069571272DNAL7 a10.2216/16-29.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDavidovich, Nickolai A.10aSexual reproduction in Schizostauron (Bacillariophyta) and a preliminary phylogeny of the genus  ap. 77-93.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe focus of this paper is the sexual reproduction and phylogeny of Schizostauron Grunow, which were studied using clonal cultures isolated from the Indian Ocean coast of Mozambique near Tofo and Bazaruto. Taxa of Schizostauron were characterized by light and electron microscopy and a phylogeny derived from three genes (rbcL, psbC and short subunit). Schizostauron was established in the second half of the 19th century, then forgotten, with its taxa included in Cocconeis or Achnanthes sensu lato. Schizostauron, together with Astartiella and perhaps also Kolbesia and Karayevia, seems to form a third lineage of monoraphid diatoms, which are related to biraphid diatoms belonging to the Stauroneidaceae and Parlibellus, but not to the two other lineages of monoraphids (Achnanthes and the Achnanthidiaceae–Cocconeidaceae group). In culture, size reduction was followed by release of gametes and auxosporulation in mixtures of clones. Despite some morphological differences, four clones from the Bazaruto population proved to be sexually compatible, one of the clones being sexually compatible with the three others. Before gametogenesis, cells gathered in groups of two to eight through active movement. Some groups of cells surrounded themselves by weakly visible mucilage. Reproduction was isogamous morphologically, and apparently also behaviourally. Growing auxospores were surrounded by the empty irregularly arranged frustules of parental cells. In numerous aspects the pattern of sexual reproduction of Schizostauron is similar to that of Achnanthes sensu stricto. The rbcL identity matrix (IDM) for sexually compatible clones ranged between 0.998 and 0.984. One clone derived from the Tofo population had an IDM below 0.900 and was sexually isolated from the remaining clones. A description of Schizostauron davidovichiorum sp. nov. is provided.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAchnanthes 3aCocconeis 3acoasts 3aelectron microscopy 3agametogenesis 3amucilages 3aphylogeny 3asexual reproduction 3aIndian Ocean 3aMozambique 0aAuxosporulation 0aMonoraphid diatoms 0aSchizostauron1 aDavidovich, Olga I.1 aWitkowski, Andrzej1 aLi, Chunlian1 aDabek, Przemysław1 aMann, D.

TNF-α is a multi-factorial protein that regulates cell survival, differentiation and apoptosis. In a previous study, we reported that HN protein induces apoptosis by downregulating NF-κB expression. Further, we speculated that downregulation of NF-κB expression might sensitize HeLa cells to TNF-α-mediated apoptosis. Therefore, the present study was undertaken to investigate if HN protein could sensitize HeLa cells to TNF-α and to examine the apoptotic potential of the HN protein and TNF-α in combination. The results revealed that the pro-apoptotic effects were more pronounced with the combination of HN and TNF-α than with HN or TNF-α alone, which indicates that the HN protein indeed sensitized the HeLa cells to TNF-α-induced cell death. The results of the study provide a mechanistic insight into the apoptotic action of HN protein along with TNF-α, which could be valuable in treating tumor types that are naturally resistant to TNF-α.  aPublisher supplied data 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 3acell viability 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3amembrane proteins 3ahemagglutinins 3aAvian orthoavulavirus 1 3asialidase 3aapoptosis 0aNewcastle disease virus1 aGupta, Shishir Kumar1 aSingh, Prafull Kumar1 aGandham, Ravi Kumar1 aSahoo, A.

The total studied area is about 1278 km2 with a specific Mediterranean-type continental interior climate, which is cold in winter and hot in summer. To conduct the required laboratory chemical analysis for groundwater samples in the studied basin, 78 groundwater samples, in total, were collected from 39 water wells in the dry and wet seasons in 2014 and analyzed for major cations and anions, and the results were compared with the permitted limits for drinking water. An examination of the chemical concentrations of the World Health Organization drinking water norms demonstrate that a large portion of the groundwater samples is suitable for drinking, and a preponderance of groundwater samples situated in the class of hard and very hard water types for both seasons. Suitability of groundwater for drinking use was additionally assessed according to the water quality index classification. This showed that more than 98% of groundwater samples have good water quality in the dry and wet seasons. Conversely, the classification of groundwater samples based on Piper&rsquo;s diagram designates that the groundwater type is alkaline water, with existing bicarbonate along with sulfate and chloride. However, water&ndash;rock exchange processes and groundwater flow have been responsible for the dominant water type of Ca&ndash;Mg&ndash;HCO<inf>3</inf>.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWorld Health Organization 3aalkalinity 3aanions 3abasins 3abicarbonates 3acations 3achemical analysis 3achlorides 3aclimate 3acold 3adrinking 3adrinking water 3agroundwater 3agroundwater flow 3ahydrogeochemistry 3asulfates 3asummer 3awater hardness 3awells 3awet season 3awinter 3aIraq1 aAli, Salahalddin  S.1 aAl-Ansari, Nadhir  A.1 aKnutsson, Sven 0 tWater.g2019 Apr. 03, v. 11, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w110406903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02958naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245011500169300001400284520163200298592002801930650001301958650001001971650002101981650001202002650001002014650001802024650000902042650002002051650001302071650002102084650002602105650002902131650002602160650001702186700001902203700001802222700001802240700001302258700001402271700001602285700001502301773007802316856008502394852000902479655001202488IND60082847220221121061652.0141101e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008284722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.plasmid.2011.08.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Xue-Qin10aConstruction of a plasmid vector for liver-specific inhibition of hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha expression  ap. 60-66.  aHepatocyte nuclear factor-4alpha (HNF-4a) is an important transcription factor in the liver, and regulates a large number of genes involved in many aspects of hepatocyte functions. In this study, a liver-specific transcriptional regulatory element comprised of albumin promoter (ALBp) and alpha-fetoprotein enhancer (AFPe) was obtained and cloned into the plasmid pHNF4sh-CMV(short hairpin RNA targeting HNF4α) with original CMV promoter removed, resulting to pHNF4sh-EP for liver-specific knockdown of HNF4α expression. In an attempt to verify its characteristics, pHNF4sh-EP was transfected to L02, HepG2, and COS1 cell lines in vitro and delivered into mice in vivo. pHNF4sh-CMV and pNCsh-EP were used as controls. For in vitro, the level of HNF4α mRNA and protein was decreased in all cell lines transfected with pHNF4sh-CMV whereas HNF4α mRNA and protein decreasing was only observed in L02 and HepG2 cell lines upon transfection with pHNF4sh-EP, and this decreasing was more significant as compared with pHNF4sh-CMV transfected cells. For in vivo, the decreasing of HNF4α mRNA and protein was observed in both liver and kidney tissues upon transfection with pHNF4sh-CMV. After transfection with pHNF4sh-EP, decreasing of HNF4α mRNA and protein was only found in liver tissue and this decreasing was more significant. No obvious HNF4α mRNA and protein decreasing was detected either in vitro or in vivo after transfected with pNCsh-EP. In conclusion, pHNF4sh-EP could highly-active and liver-specific knockdown of HNF4α expression liver and it will be useful for further study of the funcitions of HNF4α in liver.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalbumins 3agenes 3ahuman cell lines 3akidneys 3aliver 3amessenger RNA 3amice 3aplasmid vectors 3aplasmids 3apromoter regions 3asmall interfering RNA 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 3atransfection1 aChen, En-Qiang1 aWang, Yue-Bin1 aZhou, Tao-You1 aLiu, Li,1 aLiu, Cong1 aCheng, Xing1 aTang, Hong0 tPlasmid.g2012 Jan., v. 67, no. 1 p.60-66dElsevier Inc.x0147-619X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plasmid.2011.08.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02627naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001900146245009100165500001400256520121600270592002801486650004901514650000801563650002001571650001301591650001301604650001101617650001801628650001501646650002601661650002001687650001901707650001501726650002601741650001601767651000901783651001001792700002501802700002001827700002101847700002201868700002201890700002101912773012301933856008002056852000902136655001202145IND60718815920221120082048.0201126e20201031xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071881592DNAL7 a10.3390/agronomy101116922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLoddo, Donato 10aFirst Report of Glyphosate-Resistant Biotype of Eleusine Indica (L.)

The aim of this study was to evaluate resistance levels and possible target site resistance mechanisms of an E. indica biotype (19-1) collected from a plant nursery in Southern Italy where poor glyphosate efficacy was reported. Two dose-response experiments were conducted to evaluate the sensitivity of biotype 19-1 to glyphosate in comparison with two susceptible checks. 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS) sequencing was performed to identify possible mutations conferring the resistance. The susceptible biotypes were completely controlled at the glyphosate recommended field dose of 360 g ae ha⁻¹, while 50% of the plants of biotype 19-1 survived at 1440 g ae ha⁻¹. The resistance index of biotype 19-1 ranged between 5.8 and 7.3 for the response variables of fresh weight reduction and plant survival, respectively. All the plants surviving glyphosate application and sampled for DNA analyses had the point mutation P106A. The biotype 19-1 can be confirmed as glyphosate-resistant, representing the first glyphosate-resistant population of E. indica in Europe.  aPublisher supplied data 3a3-phosphoshikimate 1-carboxyvinyltransferase 3aDNA 3aEleusine indica 3aagronomy 3abiotypes 3adosage 3adose response 3aglyphosate 3aglyphosate resistance 3aplant nurseries 3apoint mutation 3apopulation 3aresistance mechanisms 3aweight loss 3aAsia 3aItaly1 aImperatore, Gaetano 1 aMilani, Andrea 1 aPanozzo, Silvia 1 aFarinati, Silvia 1 aSattin, Maurizio 1 aZanin, Giuseppe 0 tAgronomy.g2020 Oct. 31, v. 10, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12361x2073-43957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy101116923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02893naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002300189245009000212300001600302506007600318520150600394592002801900506003701928650000801965650001101973650001101984650002201995650001602017650001302033650001602046650001302062650001502075650002702090653001502117653002902132653002202161653002202183653002502205773012602230856008202356852000902438655001202447IND60557696220221207080750.0180905s2016    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055769622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.csbj.2016.09.0042doi7 aPMC50946002pmcid7 a278300532pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSeligmann, Hervé,10aUnbiased Mitoproteome Analyses Confirm Non-canonical RNA, Expanded Codon Translations  ap. 391-403.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aProteomic MS/MS mass spectrometry detections are usually biased towards peptides cleaved by experimentally added digestion enzyme(s). Hence peptides resulting from spontaneous degradation and natural proteolysis usually remain undetected. Previous analyses of tryptic human proteome data (cleavage after K, R) detected non-canonical tryptic peptides translated according to tetra- and pentacodons (codons expanded by silent mono- and dinucleotides), and from transcripts systematically (a) deleting mono-, dinucleotides after trinucleotides (delRNAs), (b) exchanging nucleotides according to 23 bijective transformations. Nine symmetric and fourteen asymmetric nucleotide exchanges (X↔Y, e.g. A↔C; and X→Y→Z→X, e.g. A→C→G→A) produce swinger RNAs. Here unbiased reanalyses of these proteomic data detect preferentially non-canonical tryptic peptides despite assuming random cleavage. Unbiased analyses couldn't reconstruct experimental tryptic digestion if most detected non-canonical peptides were false positives. Detected non-tryptic non-canonical peptides map preferentially on corresponding, previously described non-canonical transcripts, as for tryptic non-canonical peptides. Hence unbiased analyses independently confirm previous trypsin-biased analyses that showed translations of del- and swinger RNA and expanded codons. Accounting for natural proteolysis completes trypsin-biased mitopeptidome analyses, independently confirms non-canonical transcriptions and translations.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aRNA 3acodons 3ahumans 3amass spectrometry 3anucleotides 3apeptides 3aproteolysis 3aproteome 3aproteomics 3atranslation (genetics) 0aFrameshift 0aBijective transformation 0aDigestive enzymes 0aUnbiased analyses 0aRNA–DNA difference0 tComputational and Structural Biotechnology Journal.g2016, v. 14 p.391-403dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23199x2001-03707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.csbj.2016.09.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01619naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005700094040001800151100002200169245009100191300001400282520065000296592002800946653001900974653001700993653001601010653002101026653002601047700001801073773011201091856011701203852000901320655001201329IND60124952920221116234203.0151101e200006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012495292DNAL7 a10.1636/0161-8202(2000)028[0023:MDIOGA]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeinemann, Stefan10aMale dimorphism in oedothorax gibbosus (araneae, linyphiidae): a morphometric analysis  ap. 23-28.  aThe linyphiid spiders Oedothorax gibbosus (Blackwall 1841) and Oedothorax tuberosus (Blackwall 1841) were formerly described as separate species due to marked differences in prosomal structures of the males. During the last decade it was demonstrated that they are two forms of a single species. However, it remained to be shown whether the former species represent two distinct morphs or extremes of a continuum of variation. A morphometric examination of 246 alcohol-preserved specimens revealed that individual spiders can clearly be assigned to one of two forms. No intermediates were found, demonstrating that there are two distinct morphs.  aPublisher supplied data 0aSpecies status 0apolymorphism 0amorphometry 0asexual selection 0agustatorial courtship1 aUhl, Gabriele0 tJournal of arachnology.g2000 June, v. 28, no. 1 p.23-28dAmerican Arachnological Society.x0161-82027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1636%2F0161-8202%282000%29028%5B0023%3AMDIOGA%5D2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03006naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002200189245013300211300001600344506007600360520118100436592002801617506003701645650002101682650002301703650001801726650001601744650001801760650002601778650001901804650003601823650002201859650002501881650002701906653000801933653000701941653001101948653000801959653000901967653000801976653000701984653001701991653002402008653002402032653001902056653001102075653001102086700002002097700002702117700002402144700001902168773012602187856008202313852000902395655001202404IND60557696320221207093627.0180905s2016    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055769632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.csbj.2016.10.0042doi7 aPMC51076442pmcid7 a278726862pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZucchelli, Silvia10aEngineering Translation in Mammalian Cell Factories to Increase Protein Yield: The Unexpected Use of Long Non-Coding SINEUP RNAs  ap. 404-410.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMammalian cells are an indispensable tool for the production of recombinant proteins in contexts where function depends on post-translational modifications. Among them, Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells are the primary factories for the production of therapeutic proteins, including monoclonal antibodies (MAbs). To improve expression and stability, several methodologies have been adopted, including methods based on media formulation, selective pressure and cell- or vector engineering. This review presents current approaches aimed at improving mammalian cell factories that are based on the enhancement of translation. Among well-established techniques (codon optimization and improvement of mRNA secondary structure), we describe SINEUPs, a family of antisense long non-coding RNAs that are able to increase translation of partially overlapping protein-coding mRNAs. By exploiting their modular structure, SINEUP molecules can be designed to target virtually any mRNA of interest, and thus to increase the production of secreted proteins. Thus, synthetic SINEUPs represent a new versatile tool to improve the production of secreted proteins in biomanufacturing processes.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aChinese hamsters 3abiopharmaceuticals 3abiotechnology 3aengineering 3amessenger RNA 3amonoclonal antibodies 3anon-coding RNA 3apost-translational modification 3aprotein secretion 3arecombinant proteins 3atranslation (genetics) 0aCHO 0aER 0alncRNA 0aMAb 0aSINE 0aSME 0aSP 0aCell factory 0aRecombinant protein 0aProtein translation 0aSignal peptide 0alncRNA 0aSINEUP1 aPatrucco, Laura1 aPersichetti, Francesca1 aGustincich, Stefano1 aCotella, Diego0 tComputational and Structural Biotechnology Journal.g2016, v. 14 p.404-410dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23199x2001-03707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.csbj.2016.10.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02935naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002700147245012800174300001600302520155600318592002801874650002201902650001601924650001301940650001301953650002301966650001001989650002701999650001802026650000902044653002402053653005602077653004202133653003102175653002502206653002802231700002902259700002102288773011302309856008202422852000902504655001202513IND60644102220221123014559.0190718e20190715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064410222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lfs.2019.05.0362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFallah Mohammadi, Ziya10aComparing the effects of progressive and mild intensity treadmill running protocols on neuroprotection of parkinsonian rats  ap. 219-224.  aParkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by progressive loss of dopamine cells. It is suggested that exercise could be employed as a non-pharmacological approach for reducing the risk of PD incidence. The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of 4-week Mild-intensity (MIEx) and progressive exercise (PEx) protocols on rotational behavior, GFAP, DA, TH, MANF, CDNF and NGF levels in striatum of parkinsonian rats induced by 6-hydroxydopamine.42 Wistar male rats were divided into 6 groups including, healthy and PD controls, MIEx, PEx, healthy MIEx, and healthy PEx. MIEx protocol was performed as follows: 5 days a week, 2 sessions a day of 15 min at a speed of 15 m/min. PEx protocol encompassed a training regimen of 5 days a week initiating by 20 min in the first day reaching 50 min on the fifth day and 60 min in the next 3 weeks. PD was induced after training protocol by injection of 6-OHDA into the striatum of rats. For confirming PD, apomorphine rotational test was employed.The MIEx protocol did not have any positive impacts on the variables except for CDNF (P < 0.0001). Levels of DA (P < 0.0001) and TH (P = 0.0004) increased significantly after performing PEx protocol. Moreover, PEx protocol considerably reduced rotational behavior of rats (P = 0.0244).The findings of this research confirm positive effects of PEx in protecting against PD. This progressive training protocol has explicitly shown a neuroprotective effect against PD-inducing nervous toxin through increasing neurotrophins.  aPublisher supplied data 3aParkinson disease 3aapomorphine 3adopamine 3aexercise 3alaboratory animals 3amales 3aneuroprotective effect 3aneurotrophins 3arats 0aParkinson's disease 0aMesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor 0aCerebral dopamine neurotrophic factor 0aNeurotrophic growth factor 0aProgressive exercise 0aMild-intensity exercise1 aFalah Mohammadi, Hossein1 aPatel, Darpan I.0 tLife sciences.g2019 July 15, v. 229 p.219-224dElsevier Inc.aElsevier Inc.wJournal:11720x0024-32057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2019.05.0363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01869naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245009600174300001600270520085600286592002801142650001801170650002101188650001101209653001901220653001401239653002701253653001101280653001801291653000801309653001101317653001601328773008201344856008401426852000901510655001201519IND60545150620221121181833.0160901e20140301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054515062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.watres.2013.12.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFilella, Montserrat10aUnderstanding what we are measuring: Standards and quantification of natural organic matter  ap. 287-293.  aSome of the problems involved in quantifying operationally-defined parameters in natural waters are generally overlooked.

In all cases, the results obtained are noticeably dependent on the standard, though the type of dependency varies. Key aspects are discussed in detail and advice is given about the procedure to follow when reporting data.

Conventional genotyping study of a community outbreak of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) that occurred in Kanchanaburi Province, Thailand was carried out. The study revealed that the outbreak was clonal and the strain was identified as a member of Beijing family. Although, the outbreak isolates showed identical spoligotyping and mycobacterial interspersed repetitive units-variable number tandem repeats patterns, a discrepancy regarding ethambutol resistance was observed. In-depth characterization of the isolates through whole genome sequencing of the first and the last three isolates from our culture collection showed them to belong to principal genetic group 1, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) cluster group 2, sequence type 10. Compared with the M. tuberculosis H37Rv reference genome, 1242 SNPs were commonly found in all isolates. The genomes of these isolates were shown to be clonal and highly stable over a 5-year period and two or three unique SNPs were identified in each of the last three isolates. Genes known to be associated with drug resistance and their promoter regions, where applicable, were analyzed. The presence of low or no fitness cost mutations for drug resistance and an additional L731P SNP in the rpoB gene was observed in all isolates. These findings might account for the successful transmission of this MDR-TB strain.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMycobacterium tuberculosis 3agenes 3agenotyping 3amultiple drug resistance 3apromoter regions 3asequence analysis 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3atandem repeat sequences 3atuberculosis 3aThailand1 aChaiprasert, Angkana1 aKulawonganunchai, Supasak1 aTongsima, Sissades1 aCoker, Olabisi Oluwabukola1 aPrammananan, Therdsak1 aViratyosin, Wasna1 aThaipisuttikul, Iyarit0 tMolecular genetics and genomics.g2015 Oct., v. 290, no. 5 p.1933-1941dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1617-46157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00438-015-1048-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03180naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002100153245009800174520148500272592002801757650002301785650000801808650005201816650002701868650001601895650003601911650001301947650001601960650001201976650001501988651001202003651001202015653001902027653001502046653002702061653001302088653003402101653000802135653001302143700001902156700002202175700002302197700001902220700001902239700001902258700002602277700002002303700002102323700002902344700002402373773012002397856008802517852000902605655001202614IND60779738820221120041504.0220628e20220910xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077973882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1565352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrasek, Sarah M.10aPopulation level SARS-CoV-2 fecal shedding rates determined via wastewater-based epidemiology  aWastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) has been utilized as an early warning tool to anticipate disease outbreaks, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, COVID-19 disease models built from wastewater-collected data have been limited by the complexities involved in estimating SARS-CoV-2 fecal shedding rates. In this study, wastewater from six municipalities in Arizona and Florida with distinct demographics were monitored for SARS-CoV-2 RNA between September 2020 and December 2021. Virus concentrations with corresponding clinical case counts were utilized to estimate community-wide fecal shedding rates that encompassed all infected individuals. Analyses suggest that average SARS-CoV-2 RNA fecal shedding rates typically occurred within a consistent range (7.53–9.29 log₁₀ gc/g-feces); and yet, were unique to each community and influenced by population demographics. Age, ethnicity, and socio-economic factors may have influenced shedding rates. Interestingly, populations with median age between 30 and 39 had the greatest fecal shedding rates. Additionally, rates remained relatively constant throughout the pandemic provided conditions related to vaccination and variants were unchanged. Rates significantly increased in some communities when the Delta variant became predominant. Findings in this study suggest that community-specific shedding rates may be appropriate in model development relating wastewater virus concentrations to clinical case counts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aRNA 3aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 3ademographic statistics 3aenvironment 3anationalities and ethnic groups 3apandemic 3avaccination 3aviruses 3awastewater 3aArizona 3aFlorida 0aFecal shedding 0aSARS-CoV-2 0aCommunity demographics 0aCOVID-19 0aWastewater-based epidemiology 0aWBE 0aCOVID-191 aPepper, Ian L.1 aInnes, Gabriel K.1 aSlinski, Stephanie1 aRuedas, Martha1 aSánchez, Ana,1 aBrierley, Paul1 aBetancourt, Walter Q.1 aStark, Erika R.1 aFoster, Aidan R.1 aBetts-Childress, Nick D.1 aSchmitz, Bradley W.0 tScience of the total environment.g2022 Sept. 10, v. 838 p.156535-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1565353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03230naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245013500165300001800300500001400318520147800332592002801810596006001838650002601898650001201924650001501936650001301951650002201964650002201986650001402008650001902022650001602041650001502057650001202072650000902084650002702093650002202120650001702142650002402159650003302183650001802216650001402234700002802248700005702276700002102333700002102354700002802375700002602403700002202429773013402451856008202585852000902667655001202676IND60718783220221122044447.0201126e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071878322DNAL7 a10.1007/s12298-020-00898-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRahul Kumar,10aDevelopment of transcriptome-wide SSR markers for genetic diversity and structure analysis in Macrotyloma uniflorum (Lam.) Verdc.  ap. 2255-2266.  aNAL-light  aHorsegram is an important drought resistant pulse crop from Fabaceae and can be easily grown in dry lands with no irrigation facilities. However, it remained neglected since long and has been considered as orphan legume which requires immediate attention for its improvement and for the development of new promising varieties in future. In the present study, 7352 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers were developed from the transcriptome data and 150 SSR were randomly synthesized for validation and diversity analysis in a panel of 58 horsegram genotypes. The synthesized primers included all types of repeats spanning direpeats to hexarepeats. Of the validated SSR markers, 33 markers were polymorphic and produced 40 loci which were used to analyze the genetic diversity and structure of horsegram. In total, 130 alleles were produced in a range of 2–9 alleles with maximum alleles produced by primer HTSSR 155. Expected heterozygosity (He) ranged from 0.03 to 1.00 and observed heterozygosity (Ho) ranged from 0.13 to 0.81. Polymorphism information content value ranged from 0.065 to 0.78. Dendrogram based on UPGMA and principal component analysis showed four groups of the 58 genotypes of horsegram. Structure analysis showed three genetic stocks for the analyzed germplasm. Thus, the developed SSRs can be useful in future population genetics analysis, molecular breeding studies and mapping works in horsegram germplasm as well as in related legume species.  aPublisher supplied data  aYSS/2015/000521cScience and Engineering Research Board 3aMacrotyloma uniflorum 3aalleles 3aarid lands 3abreeding 3adrought tolerance 3agenetic variation 3agermplasm 3aheterozygosity 3ainformation 3airrigation 3alegumes 3aloci 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amolecular biology 3apolymorphism 3apopulation genetics 3aprincipal component analysis 3atranscriptome 3avarieties1 aKaundal, Sumeet Parkash1 aSharma, Vikas1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7378-557X1 aSharma, Ashutosh1 aSingh, Gagandeep1 aŚarmā, Rāma Kumāra,1 aChahota, Rakesh Kumar1 aSharma, Tilak Raj0 tPhysiology and molecular biology of plants.g2020 Nov., v. 26, no. 11 p.2255-2266dSpringer IndiawJournal:22882x0971-58947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12298-020-00898-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03098naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006400148245010800212300001800320500001900338520151600357592002801873596007301901596006901974596006402043596002902107596001602136650000902152650000902161650001702170650003102187650001702218650001402235650001902249650000902268650001902277650001302296650001202309650001502321651001102336700002602347700002402373773014002397856008202537852000902619655001202628IND60716560220221119144902.0201105e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071656022DNAL7 a10.1007/s10653-020-00659-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGalhardi, Juliana A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4114-792810aEnvironmental and health risk assessment of agricultural areas adjacent to uranium ore fields in Brazil  ap. 3965-3981.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aTo investigate the risks posed by trace and rare earth elements (REEs) in two tropical uranium ore fields, metal concentrations from 50 vegetable samples (corn and soybean) and their corresponding agricultural soils were evaluated in a U mining area and a U-rich coal mining area in Brazil. Samples from both areas had metal concentrations (REE: La to Lu, and trace elements: As, Pb, Cd, Ni, Cu, Cr, Mn, Zn, Ba, U, Sr) that were higher than the guidelines proposed by the Brazilian environmental agency. Soils from the U mining area (Poços de Caldas) generally had higher contents of trace elements than the coal mining area (Figueira), with the exception of Ni and Cr, indicating a higher risk of pollution, which was confirmed by a pollution load index that was greater than unity. For both sites, concentrations of uranium in the soil and plants, its hazard quotients and the soil contamination factor were higher in agricultural fields closer to the mines, indicating that contamination and the consequent risks to human health were distance dependent. REE concentrations averaged 52.8 mg kg⁻¹ in the topsoils and 0.76 mg kg⁻¹ in the grains for Figueira, whereas higher values of 371 mg kg⁻¹ (topsoils) and 0.9 mg kg⁻¹ (grains) were found in Poços de Caldas. Based upon corn and soybean consumption, the estimated intake dose of the REE was lower than the intake dose predicted to be problematic for human health for both sites, indicating limited risk related to the ingestion of REE.  aPublisher supplied data  a000cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico  a000cNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada  a000cFonds de Recherche du Québec - Nature et Technologies  a000cVale Canada Limited  a000cMitacs 3acoal 3acorn 3ageochemistry 3ahealth effects assessments 3ahuman health 3aingestion 3apollution load 3arisk 3asoil pollution 3asoybeans 3auranium 3avegetables 3aBrazil1 ade Mello, Jaime W.

However, its biological role in lung carcinogenesis is largely unknown. In this study, we found that S100A4 was frequently overexpressed in lung cancer cells, irrespective of histological subtype. Then we performed knockdown and forced expression of S100A4 in lung cancer cell lines and found that specific knockdown of S100A4 effectively suppressed cell proliferation only in lung cancer cells with S100A4-overexpression; forced expression of S100A4 accelerated cell motility only in S100A4 low-expressing lung cancer cells. PRDM2 and VASH1, identified as novel upregulated genes by microarray after specific knockdown of S100A4 in pancreatic cancer, were also analyzed, and we found that PRDM2 was significantly upregulated after S100A4-knockdown in one of two analyzed S100A4-overexpressing lung cancer cells. Our present results suggest that S100A4 plays an important role in lung carcinogenesis by means of cell proliferation and motility by a pathway similar to that in pancreatic cancer.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcium-binding proteins 3acarcinogenesis 3acell growth 3acell movement 3acell proliferation 3agene expression regulation 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3alung neoplasms 3ametastasis 3amicroarray technology 3aneoplasm cells 3apancreatic neoplasms 0aS100A4 0aCell proliferation 0aMigration 0aLung cancer 0aPRDM21 aSatō, Daisuke,1 aSaiki, Yuriko1 aSunamura, Makoto1 aFukushige, Shinichi1 aHorii, Akira0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2014 May 09, v. 447 p.459-464dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2014.04.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02635naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001600142245010800158520165600266592002801922650000901950650001301959650001101972650002401983700001802007700001202025700001902037700001502056700001802071700001602089773011802105856007702223852000902300655001202309IND60791006120221122063413.0220826e20220722xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079100612DNAL7 a10.3390/land110811242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Meng 10aAnalysis of Land Use Optimization of Metro Station Areas Based on Two-Way Balanced Ridership in Xi’an  aWith the development of metro systems, the problem of unbalanced ridership into and out of the stations, caused by the singleness of station area development, has become increasingly prominent. Research on land use optimization in metro station areas based on a two-way balance of ridership is proposed. First, the stepwise regression analysis method was used to build a relationship model between ridership and the land use index under the guidance of the two-way balance of ridership. Second, the range was optimized by calculating the land use factors of the metro station area. Finally, the land use of the metro station area was optimized from the perspectives of development intensity and land usage. Taking metro stations in Xi’an as an example, the results show that the land use characteristics of metro station areas are quite different. Under the guidance of the two-way balance of ridership, the current land use values of Daminggongxi Station, Nanshaomen Station, and Tiyuchang Station exceed the optimal value range and can be reduced by more than 2.78%. The current land use values of Chaoyangmen Station, Longshouyuan Station, and Weiyijie Station are within the optimized range. The land use values of Kaiyuanmen Station, Banpo Station, and Fengchengwulu Station are below the optimized range and could be increased by more than 13.7%. In addition, optimizing the development intensity or adjusting the land type is further proposed to ensure that the land use factors of station areas are within the calculated optimal value range. The results provide a reference for the optimization of land use in the Xi’an metro station area.  aPublisher supplied data 3aland 3aland use 3amodels 3aregression analysis1 aTong, Haiyan 1 aLi, Bo 1 aDuan, Yaqiong 1 aLi, Yubai 1 aWang, Jianpo 1 aLei, Kexin 0 tLand.g2022 July 22, v. 11, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21555x2073-445X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land110811243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03817naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245010600167300001800273500001400291520210800305592002802413596005402441596005902495650002002554650002002574650001302594650002502607650001302632650003102645650001002676650001502686650001802701650001102719650001302730650002202743650002302765650001502788650001402803650001402817650001102831650001102842650002102853650002402874650002902898700001702927700001802944700001802962700005802980773013403038856008203172852000903254655001203263IND60718783420221122044504.0201126e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071878342DNAL7 a10.1007/s12298-020-00895-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Yang-Fei10aIllumina sequencing revealed roles of microRNAs in different aluminum tolerance of two citrus species  ap. 2173-2187.  aNAL-light  aSelf-germinated seedlings of Citrus sinensis and C. grandis were supplied with nutrient solution with 0 mM AlCl₃·6H₂O (control, −Al) or 1 mM AlCl₃·6H₂O (+Al) for 18 weeks. The DW (Dry weights) of leaf, stem, shoot and the whole plant of C. grandis were decreased and the ratio of root DW to shoot DW in C. grandis were increased by Al, whereas these parameters of C. sinensis were not changed by Al. Al treatment dramatically decreased the sulfur (S) content in C. grandis roots and the phosphorus (P) content in both C. sinensis and C. grandis roots. More Al was transported to shoots and leaves in C. grandis than in C. sinensis under Al treatment. Al treatment has more adverse effects on C. grandis than on C. sinensis, as revealed by the higher production of superoxide anion (O₂·⁻), H₂O₂ and thiobarbituric acid reactive substace (TBARS) content in C. grandis roots. Via the Illumina sequencing technique, we successfully identified and quantified 12 and 16 differentially expressed miRNAs responding to Al stress in C. sinensis and C. grandis roots, respectively. The possible mechanism underlying different Al tolerance of C. sinensis and C. grandis were summarized as having following aspects: (a) enhancement of adventitious and lateral root development (miR160); (b) up-regulation of stress and signaling transduction related genes, such as SGT1, PLC and AAO (miR477, miR397 and miR398); (c) enhancement of citrate secretion (miR3627); (d) more flexible control of alternative glycolysis pathway and TCA cycle (miR3627 and miR482); (e) up-regulation of S-metabolism (miR172); (f) more flexible control of miRNA metabolism. For the first time, we showed that root development (miR160) and cell wall components (cas-miR5139, csi-miR12105) may play crucial roles in Al tolerance in citrus plants. In conclusion, our study provided a comprehensive profile of differentially expressed miRNAs in response to Al stress between two citrus plants differing in Al tolerance which further enriched our understanding of the molecular mechanism underlying Al tolerance in plants.  aPublisher supplied data  a2017YFD0202000cNational Key R&D Program of China  a31301740cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aCitrus sinensis 3aadverse effects 3aaluminum 3acell wall components 3acitrates 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3aglycolysis 3alateral roots 3aleaves 3amicroRNA 3amolecular biology 3anutrient solutions 3aphosphorus 3asecretion 3aseedlings 3ashoots 3asulfur 3asuperoxide anion 3athiobarbituric acid 3atricarboxylic acid cycle1 aWang, Yan-Yu1 aChen, Wei-Wei1 aChen, Li-Song1 aYang, Lin-Tong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1876-41270 tPhysiology and molecular biology of plants.g2020 Nov., v. 26, no. 11 p.2173-2187dSpringer IndiawJournal:22882x0971-58947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12298-020-00895-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03555naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100001900149245008000168300001600248520192600264592002802190650002502218650001202243650002502255650001102280650001102291650002002302650001402322650001402336650001202350650001402362650002302376650002202399650002602421650001902447650001302466650001802479650002602497650001402523650001702537650001802554650001002572650002202582650001702604650001702621650002102638650001802659700001802677700001902695700001702714700002102731700002002752773009902772856008502871852000902956655001202965IND4449022520221116142346.0141112e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444902252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.soilbio.2010.11.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOlsen, Ylva S.10aCattle grazing drives nitrogen and carbon cycling in a temperate salt marsh  ap. 531-541.  aWe examined the impact of long-term cattle grazing on soil processes and microbial activity in a temperate salt marsh. Soil conditions, microbial biomass and respiration, mineralization and denitrification rates were measured in upper salt marsh that had been ungrazed or cattle grazed for several decades. Increased microbial biomass and soil respiration were observed in grazed marsh, most likely stimulated by enhanced rates of root turnover and root exudation. We found a significant positive effect of grazing on potential N mineralization rates measured in the laboratory, but this difference did not translate to in situ net mineralization measured monthly from May to September. Rates of denitrification were lowest in the grazed marsh and appeared to be limited by nitrate availability, possibly due to more anoxic conditions and lower rates of nitrification. The major effect of grazing on N cycling therefore appeared to be in limiting losses of N through denitrification, which may lead to enhanced nutrient availability to saltmarsh plants, but a reduced ability of the marsh to act as a buffer for land-derived nutrients to adjacent coastal areas. Additionally, we investigated if grazing influences the rates of turnover of labile and refractory C in saltmarsh soils by adding ¹⁴C-labelled leaf litter or root exudates to soil samples and monitoring the evolution of ¹⁴CO₂. Grazing had little effect on the rates of mineralization of ¹⁴C used as a respiratory substrate, but a larger proportion of ¹⁴C was partitioned into microbial biomass and immobilized in long- and medium-term storage pools in the grazed treatment. Grazing slowed down the turnover of the microbial biomass, which resulted in longer turnover times for both leaf litter and root exudates. Grazing may therefore affect the longevity of C in the soil and alter C storage and utilization pathways in the microbial community.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanaerobic conditions 3abuffers 3acarbon sequestration 3acattle 3acoasts 3adenitrification 3aevolution 3aexudation 3agrazing 3alongevity 3amicrobial activity 3amicrobial biomass 3amicrobial communities 3amineralization 3anitrates 3anitrification 3anutrient availability 3anutrients 3aplant litter 3aroot exudates 3aroots 3asalt marsh plants 3asalt marshes 3asoil quality 3asoil respiration 3asoil sampling1 aDausse, Armel1 aGarbutt, Angus1 aFord, Hilary1 aThomas, David N.1 aJones, David L.0 tSoil biology & biochemistry.g2011 Mar., v. 43, no. 3 p.531-541dElsevier Ltdx0038-07177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2010.11.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02698naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245012300161300001600284500002000300520146400320592002801784650002301812650002501835650002101860650001001881650002401891650001001915650001501925650001801940650001401958650001501972650001401987650001402001650001602015650002002031650002102051700002602072773009602098856007302194852000902267655001202276IND60523605120221117190231.0160623e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052360512DNAL7 a10.1890/10-0516.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGoodman, Brett A.10aEcomorphology and disease: cryptic effects of parasitism on host habitat use, thermoregulation, and predator avoidance  ap. 542-548.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aParasites can cause dramatic changes in the phenotypes of their hosts, sometimes leading to a higher probability of predation and parasite transmission. Because an organism's morphology directly affects its locomotion, even subtle changes in key morphological traits may affect survival and behavior. However, despite the ubiquity of parasites in natural communities, few studies have incorporated parasites into ecomorphological research. Here, we evaluated the effects of parasite‐induced changes in host phenotype on the habitat use, thermal biology, and simulated predator‐escape ability of Pacific chorus frogs (Pseudacris regilla) in natural environments. Frogs with parasite‐induced limb malformations were more likely to use ground microhabitats relative to vertical refugia and selected less‐angled perches closer to the ground in comparison with normal frogs. Although both groups had similar levels of infection, malformed frogs used warmer microhabitats, which resulted in higher body temperatures. Likely as a result of their morphological abnormalities, malformed frogs allowed a simulated predator to approach closer before escaping and escaped shorter distances relative to normal frogs. These data indicate that parasite‐induced morphological changes can significantly alter host behavior and habitat use, highlighting the importance of incorporating the ubiquitous, albeit cryptic, role of parasites into ecomorphological research.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPseudacris regilla 3aabnormal development 3abody temperature 3afrogs 3ahabitat preferences 3ahosts 3alocomotion 3amicrohabitats 3aparasites 3aparasitism 3aphenotype 3apredation 3aprobability 3arefuge habitats 3athermoregulation1 aJohnson, Pieter T.

The spatial distribution patterns exhibited a general southward decline in soil and sediment from the bay entrance to the inner bay. The concentration ratios of plants to soil inferred that no distinguished selective adsorption of PCBs congeners by plants existed and PCBs were mainly attributed to the air deposition on plant surface. The fugacity ratios among vapor, aerosol and soil indicted that the equilibrium status has not been reached and the net transferring direction was air–soil.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aaerosols 3aair 3aanimal manures 3abirds 3acase studies 3afeces 3apolychlorinated biphenyls 3areindeer 3asediments 3asoil 3avapors 3awater pollution 3aArctic region 0aPolychlorinated biphenyls 0aThe Arctic 0aMulti-environmental media 0aFugacity 0aMigration1 aGe, Linke1 aGao, Hui1 aYao, Ting1 aFang, Xiaodan1 aZhou, Chuanguang1 aNa, Guangshui0 tMarine pollution bulletin.g2014 Dec. 15, v. 89, no. 1-2 p.267-275dElsevier LtdwJournal:12420x0025-326X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2014.09.0503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02596naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001500153245012300168300001600291520109100307592002801398650002901426650002301455650001401478650001301492650002101505650001801526650001601544650001601560650002201576650002001598650001301618651001001631653002701641653002001668653002201688653002201710653002501732653002001757700001701777700001801794700001501812700001101827700002001838700001801858773011701876856008801993852000902081655001202090IND60540177120221123044554.0190318e20141215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054017712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.marpolbul.2014.09.0512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLv, Weiwei10aMacrobenthic diversity in protected, disturbed, and newly formed intertidal wetlands of a subtropical estuary in China  ap. 259-266.  aIn this study, intertidal macrobenthic diversity in protected, disturbed, and newly formed wetlands of Yangtze estuary was assessed using PRIMER 5.2 based on species diversity and species relatedness. We observed high diversity in nature reserves and low diversity in adjacent disturbed and newly formed wetlands. These diversity data were then integrated with historical data to detect the variation in macrobenthic diversity over the past two decades. The integrated data indicated that the intertidal macrobenthic diversity sharply decreased in heavy reclamation tidal flats whereas markedly increased in non-disturbed nature reserve and newly formed wetland. Benthic health was observed with the departure degree of average taxonomic distinctness (Δ+) and variation in taxonomic distinctness (Λ+) from the simulated 95% confidence funnel. All the habitats were subjected to different levels of human interference, except Jiuduansha and Beigangbeisha. The degradation of intertidal wetland in Yangtze estuary was mainly attributed to land reclamation, overgrazing, and overfishing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropogenic activities 3aconservation areas 3aestuaries 3ahabitats 3aland restoration 3alittoral zone 3aoverfishing 3aovergrazing 3aspecies diversity 3awater pollution 3awetlands 3aChina 0aMacrobenthic diversity 0aIntertidal zone 0aProtected wetland 0aDisturbed wetland 0aNewly formed wetland 0aYangtze estuary1 aMa, Chang-an1 aHuang, Youhui1 aYang, Yang1 aYu, Ji1 aZhang, Mingqing1 aZhao, Yunlong0 tMarine pollution bulletin.g2014 Dec. 15, v. 89, no. 1-2 p.259-266dElsevier LtdwJournal:12420x0025-326X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2014.09.0513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03931naa a2200781 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245017100168300001800339520179700357592002802154650002602182650002602208650002802234650001002262650001602272650001502288650001702303650001702320650001202337650002102349650001602370650001402386650002402400650001202424650001402436650001402450650001402464650001102478653001102489653001002500653000902510653001002519653001102529653000802540653000802548653000902556653001002565653000702575653000802582653000802590653000802598653000802606653002802614653002002642653002302662653001902685653001102704700001802715700001602733700002502749700002002774700002202794700002002816700001802836700002202854700002402876700003002900700001802930773009902948856008103047852000903128655001203137IND60551151920221118021620.0161017e20150327xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055115192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jmb.2014.07.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aErnst, Katharina10aCyclophilin-Facilitated Membrane Translocation as Pharmacological Target to Prevent Intoxication of Mammalian Cells by Binary Clostridial Actin ADP-Ribosylated Toxins  ap. 1224-1238.  aClostridium botulinum C2 toxin, Clostridium perfringens iota toxin and Clostridium difficile CDT belong to the family of binary actin ADP-ribosylating toxins and are composed of a binding/translocation component and a separate enzyme component. The enzyme components ADP-ribosylate G-actin in the cytosol of target cells resulting in depolymerization of F-actin, cell rounding and cell death. The binding/translocation components bind to their cell receptors and form complexes with the respective enzyme components. After receptor-mediated endocytosis, the binding/translocation components form pores in membranes of acidified endosomes and the enzyme components translocate through these pores into the cytosol. This step is facilitated by the host cell chaperone heat shock protein 90 and peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerases including cyclophilin A. Here, we demonstrate that a large isoform of cyclophilin A, the multi-domain enzyme cyclophilin 40 (Cyp40), binds to the enzyme components C2I, Ia and CDTa in vitro. Isothermal titration calorimetry revealed a direct binding to C2I with a calculated affinity of 101nM and to Ia with an affinity of 1.01μM. Closer investigation for the prototypic C2I revealed that binding to Cyp40 did not depend on its ADP-ribosyltransferase activity but was stronger for unfolded C2I. The interaction of C2I with Cyp40 was also demonstrated in lysates from C2-treated cells by pull-down. Treatment of cells with a non-immunosuppressive cyclosporine A derivative, which still binds to and inhibits the peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase activity of cyclophilins, protected cells from intoxication with C2, iota and CDT toxins, offering an attractive approach for development of novel therapeutic strategies against binary actin ADP-ribosylating toxins.  aPublisher supplied data 3aClostridium botulinum 3aClostridium difficile 3aClostridium perfringens 3aactin 3acalorimetry 3acell death 3acyclophilins 3acyclosporine 3acytosol 3adepolymerization 3aendocytosis 3aendosomes 3aheat shock proteins 3amammals 3apoisoning 3areceptors 3atitration 3atoxins 0aPPIase 0aHsp90 0aCypA 0aCyp40 0aFKBP51 0aCsA 0aITC 0aSTED 0aBafA1 0aDT 0aTPR 0aECL 0aFCS 0aPBS 0abacterial protein toxin 0acellular uptake 0amembrane transport 0acyclophilin 40 0aPPIase1 aLanger, Simon1 aKaiser, Eva1 aOsseforth, Christian1 aMichaelis, Jens1 aPopoff, Michel R.1 aSchwan, Carsten1 aAktories, K.,1 aKahlert, Viktoria1 aMalesevic, Miroslav1 aSchiene-Fischer, Cordelia1 aBarth, Holger0 tJournal of Molecular Biology.g2015 Mar. 27, v. 427 p.1224-1238dElsevier Ltdx0022-28367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2014.07.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03811naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245012400159300001600283500002000299520142100319592002801740596005801768596005601826596003901882596003001921596004101951596003701992596001802029596001902047596002602066596002702092650002302119650002302142650001502165650002702180650001002207650003502217650001602252650001502268650001402283650002602297650001002323650002002333650001802353650001002371650000902381650001002390700003302400700002702433700006202460700001702522700002702539700001702566700006402583700002902647700006302676700002702739700001802766700007302784700005802857773011602915856007303031852000903104655001203113IND60648228120221121125547.0190627e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064822812DNAL7 a10.1111/nph.158022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPloyet, Raphael12aA systems biology view of wood formation in Eucalyptus grandis trees submitted to different potassium and water regimes  ap. 766-782.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aWood production in fast‐growing Eucalyptus grandis trees is highly dependent on both potassium (K) fertilization and water availability but the molecular processes underlying wood formation in response to the combined effects of these two limiting factors remain unknown. E. grandis trees were submitted to four combinations of K‐fertilization and water supply. Weighted gene co‐expression network analysis and MixOmics‐based co‐regulation networks were used to integrate xylem transcriptome, metabolome and complex wood traits. Functional characterization of a candidate gene was performed in transgenic E. grandis hairy roots. This integrated network‐based approach enabled us to identify meaningful biological processes and regulators impacted by K‐fertilization and/or water limitation. It revealed that modules of co‐regulated genes and metabolites strongly correlated to wood complex traits are in the heart of a complex trade‐off between biomass production and stress responses. Nested in these modules, potential new cell‐wall regulators were identified, as further confirmed by the functional characterization of EgMYB137. These findings provide new insights into the regulatory mechanisms of wood formation under stressful conditions, pointing out both known and new regulators co‐opted by K‐fertilization and/or water limitation that may potentially promote adaptive wood traits.  aPublisher supplied data  cCentre National pour la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)  cFrench Laboratory of Excellence project ‘TULIP’  aID 1203‐003cAgropolis Fondation  aANR‐10‐LABX‐41cANR  aANR‐10‐LABX‐372 0001‐01cANR  aANR‐11‐IDEX‐0002‐02cANR  a017/13cCAPES  a014/2012cCNPq  a444793/2014‐3cCNPq  a2013/25642‐5cFAPESP 3aEucalyptus grandis 3abiomass production 3acell walls 3afertilizer application 3agenes 3agenetically modified organisms 3ametabolites 3ametabolome 3apotassium 3apotassium fertilizers 3aroots 3astress response 3atranscriptome 3atrees 3awood 3axylem1 aVeneziano Labate, Mônica T.1 aRegiani Cataldi, Thais1 aChristina, Mathias1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3618-756X1 aMorel, Marie1 aSan Clemente, Hélène1 aDenis, Marie1 aFavreau, Bénédicte1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2786-93741 aTomazello Filho, Mário,1 aLaclau, Jean‐Paul1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2506-214X1 aLabate, Carlos Alberto1 aChaix, Gilles1 aGrima‐Pettenati, Jacqueline1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4272-97671 aMounet, Fabien1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6632-30700 tnew phytologist.g2019 July, v. 223, no. 2 p.766-782dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44665x0028-646X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/nph.158023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02955naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100003800142245011500180520186200295592002802157650001602185650002602201650002202227650002102249650001102270650000902281650001202290650001302302700003702315700002902352700003202381773011802413856007702531852000902608655001202617IND60791006520221122063146.0220826e20220727xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079100652DNAL7 a10.3390/land110811622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaldonado-Erazo, Claudia Patricia10aUse of Natural and Cultural Resources by Tourism as a Strategy for Regional Development: Bibliometric Analysis  aTerritories throughout different continents have a wide variety of natural and cultural resources, defined by the dynamics of spatiality, temporality, and functionality that have been generated by the human groups settled in these spaces. These resources have become an object of study of great interest since they constitute the initial sources for the definition of the tourism potential of destinations, as well as contributing to the generation of new tourism activities and modalities for those already consolidated. Although these resources were initially used as objects of exploitation, with the passage of time the dynamics have changed to the use of these resources, focusing on the foundation of the pillars of sustainability, a condition that implies practices of environmental valuation in situ, the recognition of the cultural heritage of the territories and the valuation of the interaction between culture–nature–human beings. The objective of this research is to identify the existing scientific production in which the relationship between the tourist exploitation of natural and cultural resources and regional development is explored. Bibliometric analysis based on the guidelines of the PRISMA method was used. The international databases considered were Web of Science and Scopus. The analysis was complemented with an overlap analysis to establish the relationship of information between the WoS and Scopus databases. A total of 507 documents on the subject were identified, which provided a preliminary X-ray that will allow future research work to be focused on this line of re-search. The results allowed us to observe that there is little literature on the relationship between the use of natural and cultural resources for tourism and the regional development of the territory, both from an economic and social point of view.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3abibliometric analysis 3acultural heritage 3aecological value 3ahumans 3aland 3atourism 3atourists1 adel Río-Rama, María de la Cruz1 aÁlvarez-García, José,1 aFlores-Mancheno, Ana Carola0 tLand.g2022 July 27, v. 11, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21555x2073-445X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land110811623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02276naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001700145245011300162300001600275520122900291592002801520650002501548650002501573650001801598650002401616650002501640650001101665650002001676650002501696650001901721651001901740700002101759773008901780856004801869852000901917655001201926IND4468175220221116151802.0120607e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446817522DNAL7 a10.1007/s10750-012-1018-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVymazal, Jan10aRemoval of alkali metals and their sequestration in plants in constructed wetlands treating municipal sewage  ap. 131-143.  aThis study is aimed at retention of K, Na, Mg, and Ca in two constructed wetlands (CWs) in the Czech Republic, and on the evaluation of particular standing stocks in both above- and belowground plant biomass. The study revealed that CWs with horizontal subsurface flow are not effective in retention of studied elements. Removal of K, Na, Mg, and Ca averaged only 10.6, 7.4, 6.1, and 1.4%, respectively. In general, concentrations of studied elements in various parts of Phragmites australis and Phalaris arundinacea were found within the range of concentrations reported from both natural and CWs. Aboveground standing stocks for K, Na and Mg were comparable with those reported from natural stands for both Phalaris and Phragmites, but Ca aboveground standing stocks found in our study were lower compared to those found in several natural Phragmites wetlands. Aboveground to belowground standing stock ratio was generally >1.0. However, this amount formed usually <1% of the annual inflow load of particular elements. The results of this study provide comprehensive information on retention and sequestration of K, Na, Mg, and Ca in vegetation during municipal wastewater treatment in CWs with subsurface horizontal flow.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhalaris arundinacea 3aPhragmites australis 3aalkali metals 3abelowground biomass 3aconstructed wetlands 3asewage 3asubsurface flow 3awastewater treatment 3awetland plants 3aCzech Republic1 aŠveha, Jaroslav0 tHydrobiologia.g2012 Aug., v. 692, no. 1 p.131-143dSpringer-Verlagx0018-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-012-1018-z  aDNAL 7aarticle02816naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002400137245009900161300001800260500002000278520149400298592002801792650001601820650002501836650001301861650002501874650001701899650001801916650001401934650001001948650001001958650001501968650001901983650002002002650001602022650001502038650001202053650001802065700002202083700002602105700002102131773012602152856007102278852000902349655001202358IND60585115720221118225214.0171102e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058511572DNAL7 a10.1002/ps.46532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aProdělalová, Jana10aVirucides in apiculture: persistence of surrogate enterovirus under simulated field conditions  ap. 2544-2549.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: Honeybee viruses have been recognized as being among the most important factors leading to colony losses worldwide. Colony food and faeces are regarded as possible sources of infectious viruses able to contaminate the environment and equipment of apiaries. Thus, methods for elimination of viruses are required. No cell culture assay for testing the effect of disinfectants on honeybee viruses is yet available. Therefore, surrogate virus was employed for testing of the efficacy of iodophor‐ and peracetic acid‐based disinfectants in combination with six organic contaminants at +6 °C and +22 °C. Moreover, we evaluated the persistence of the surrogate in honey at +6 °C, +22 °C, and +50 °C. RESULTS: Iodophor‐based disinfectant showed a maximum reduction of virus titre of 3.4 log₁₀. Peracetic acid reduced the titre (≥4 log₁₀) only at 22 °C and without yeast extract/bovine serum albumin. After 25 days of incubation of the virus − honey mix, no decrease of virus titre was observed at +6 °C, whereas a significant reduction (3.5 log₁₀) was found at +50 °C already after 1 day. CONCLUSIONS: Both tested disinfectants can serve as appropriate virucides in apiaries. The effect of peracetic acid significantly depended on temperature and organic contaminants. The iodophor‐based disinfectant showed a stable antiviral effect at different temperatures and with different contaminants. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data 3aEnterovirus 3aantiviral properties 3aapiaries 3abovine serum albumin 3acell culture 3adisinfectants 3aequipment 3afeces 3ahoney 3ahoney bees 3aperacetic acid 3apest management 3atemperature 3aviral load 3aviruses 3ayeast extract1 aMalenovská, Hana1 aMoutelíková, Romana1 aTitěra, Dalibor0 tPest management science.g2017 Dec., v. 73, no. 12 p.2544-2549dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl59519x1526-498X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ps.46533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02874naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002100188245007100209300001800280506007600298520128900374592002801663506003701691650002101728650001601749650001701765650002101782650001101803650001101814650001601825650002401841653000801865653001001873653000901883653000701892653001101899653001001910653000801920653003301928653001301961653002401974653002601998700002202024700002202046700002102068700001802089700002302107773010002130856008102230852000902311655001202320IND60551152020221207143359.0161017e20140923xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055115202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jmb.2014.07.0142doi7 aPMC41508472pmcid7 a250586832pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNguyễn, Bình,10aDiffusion of Human Replication Protein A along Single-Stranded DNA  ap. 3246-3261.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aReplication protein A (RPA) is a eukaryotic single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) binding protein that plays critical roles in most aspects of genome maintenance, including replication, recombination and repair. RPA binds ssDNA with high affinity, destabilizes DNA secondary structure and facilitates binding of other proteins to ssDNA. However, RPA must be removed from or redistributed along ssDNA during these processes. To probe the dynamics of RPA–DNA interactions, we combined ensemble and single-molecule fluorescence approaches to examine human RPA (hRPA) diffusion along ssDNA and find that an hRPA heterotrimer can diffuse rapidly along ssDNA. Diffusion of hRPA is functional in that it provides the mechanism by which hRPA can transiently disrupt DNA hairpins by diffusing in from ssDNA regions adjacent to the DNA hairpin. hRPA diffusion was also monitored by the fluctuations in fluorescence intensity of a Cy3 fluorophore attached to the end of ssDNA. Using a novel method to calibrate the Cy3 fluorescence intensity as a function of hRPA position on the ssDNA, we estimate a one-dimensional diffusion coefficient of hRPA on ssDNA of D1~5000nt2 s−1 at 37°C. Diffusion of hRPA while bound to ssDNA enables it to be readily repositioned to allow other proteins access to ssDNA.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abinding proteins 3adiffusivity 3afluorescence 3afluorescent dyes 3agenome 3ahumans 3amethodology 3asingle-stranded DNA 0aRPA 0assDNA 0ahRPA 0aOB 0asmTIRF 0adsDNA 0aRPA 0asingle-molecule fluorescence 0adynamics 0aDNA hairpin melting 0adiffusion coefficient1 aSokoloski, Joshua1 aGalletto, Roberto1 aElson, Elliot L.1 aWold, Marc S.1 aLohman, Timothy M.0 tJournal of Molecular Biology.g2014 Sept. 23, v. 426 p.3246-3261dElsevier Ltdx0022-28367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2014.07.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02671naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002500137245005500162300001800217500001100235520138700246592002801633650001401661650002101675650001601696650001001712650002001722650001401742650001901756650001001775650002701785650001701812650001201829650001301841650002601854650001601880650001301896650001601909650001501925650002001940650001501960650002001975773012601995856007102121852000902192655001202201IND60585115820221118225347.0171102e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058511582DNAL7 a10.1002/ps.46462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWilkins, Richard M.,10aInsecticide resistance and intracellular proteases  ap. 2403-2412.  aREVIEW  aPesticide resistance is an example of evolution in action with mechanisms of resistance arising from mutations or increased expression of intrinsic genes. Intracellular proteases have a key role in maintaining healthy cells and in responding to stressors such as pesticides. Insecticide‐resistant insects have constitutively elevated intracellular protease activity compared to corresponding susceptible strains. This increase was shown for some cases originally through biochemical enzyme studies and subsequently putatively by transcriptomics and proteomics methods. Upregulation and expression of proteases have been characterised in resistant strains of some insect species, including mosquitoes. This increase in proteolysis results in more degradation products (amino acids) of intracellular proteins. These may be utilised in the resistant strain to better protect the cell from stress. There are changes in insect intracellular proteases shortly after insecticide exposure, suggesting a role in stress response. The use of protease and proteasome inhibitors or peptide mimetics as synergists with improved application techniques and through protease gene knockdown using RNA interference (possibly expressed in crop plants) may be potential pest management strategies, in situations where elevated intracellular proteases are relevant. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data 3aCulicidae 3aRNA interference 3aamino acids 3acrops 3aenzyme activity 3aevolution 3agene targeting 3agenes 3ainsecticide resistance 3ainsecticides 3ainsects 3amutation 3aproteasome inhibitors 3aproteinases 3aproteins 3aproteolysis 3aproteomics 3astress response 3asynergists 3atranscriptomics0 tPest management science.g2017 Dec., v. 73, no. 12 p.2403-2412dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl59519x1526-498X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ps.46463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02673naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245011600164300001600280520140500296592002801701650001601729650001101745650001501756650001601771650001001787650001401797650001401811650001201825650001601837650003101853650001601884650001401900650001101914650001001925650002201935650001501957700001301972700001501985700001802000700001402018773009302032856008102125852000902206655001202215IND60537158720221122011108.0160807e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053715872DNAL7 a10.1007/s13744-016-0383-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGolizadeh, A10aSusceptibility of Five Sugar Beet Cultivars to the Black Bean Aphid, Aphis fabae Scopoli (Hemiptera: Aphididae)  ap. 427-432.  aThe black bean aphid, Aphis fabae Scopoli (Hemiptera: Aphididae), is one of the important pests of sugar beet. The relative impact of resistance, including antibiosis and antixenosis of five sugar beet cultivars (Doroti, Perimer, Pershia, Rozier and 006) on A. fabae was studied under laboratory conditions using clip cages. The antibiosis test was based on life table parameters. Significant differences on developmental time, mean number of nymphs/aphid/day, fecundity, and adult longevity of A. fabae were found across tested sugar beet cultivars. In addition, there were significant differences among the sugar beet cultivars for population growth parameters such as the intrinsic rate of natural increase (r ₘ), net reproductive rate (R ₀), finite rate of increase (λ), doubling time (DT), and mean generation time (T) of A. fabae. The highest and lowest (r ₘ) values were observed on Pershia (0.449 nymphs/female/day) and Perimer (0.358 nymphs/female/day), respectively. No significant differences were found for the preference of the black bean aphid, and antixenosis had no effect on resistance against this aphid. As a result, our findings showed that the Pershia cultivar was a relatively susceptible host plant. Two cultivars (Perimer and Rozier) were relatively resistant to A. fabae, which could prove useful in the development of IPM programs for this aphid in sugar beet fields.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAphis fabae 3aadults 3aantibiosis 3aantixenosis 3acages 3acultivars 3afecundity 3afemales 3ahost plants 3aintegrated pest management 3alife tables 3alongevity 3anymphs 3apests 3apopulation growth 3asugar beet1 aAbedi, Z1 aBorzoui, E1 aGolikhajeh, N1 aJafary, M0 tNeotropical entomology.g2016 Aug., v. 45, no. 4 p.427-432dSpringer USx1519-566X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13744-016-0383-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03045naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002700148245011700175300001800292500001900310520174500329592002802074650001202102650001202114650001102126650001702137650001002154650001702164650001702181650000902198650000902207650001302216650002002229650001002249651000902259700002302268700001702291700002002308700001902328700002102347773014002368856008202508852000902590655001202599IND60716561320221119144933.0201105e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071656132DNAL7 a10.1007/s10653-020-00599-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRastegari Mehr, Meisam10aArsenic in the rock–soil–plant system and related health risk in a magmatic–metamorphic belt, West of Iran  ap. 3659-3673.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aFollowing earlier reports of water contamination and arsenic (As) toxicity symptoms in residents of Kurdistan Province, As was determined in rock, soil and plant samples to investigate its fate from rock to crops and its potential effects on human health. Total As content ranged from 4.9 to 10,000 mg/kg, 7.7–430 mg/kg and < 0.05–25,079 µg/kg (dry weight) in rock, soil and plant samples, respectively. The Qorveh–Bijar region data indicated that magmatic differentiation has enriched late magmatic fluids in As. High rare earth elements concentration, dissociation coefficient, and positive Eu anomaly in volcanic rocks, indicated the prevalence of intermediate to felsic composition. The highest As concentration was measured in travertine. In soil, As average level in Qorveh and Bijar was 48.5 and 107 mg/kg, respectively. Higher pollution index and geoaccumulation index (Igₑₒ) were also calculated for Bijar County. The As concentration in crop samples was greater than the recommended maximum permissible concentration for foodstuff. Mann–Whitney U test revealed significant differences between As concentration in different plant species and no difference between plants in Bijar and Qorveh. Also, alfalfa displayed the highest biological accumulation coefficient among the investigated plants. The calculated chronic daily intake of As in Bijar County was higher than the recommended levels for wheat and barley grains. Moreover, the hazard quotient (HQ) and incremental lifetime cancer risk assessments revealed high non-cancer (HQ > 1 for both adults and children) and cancer (particularly for barley in Bijar) risks for inhabitants via consumption of As contaminated crops cultivated in the study area.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalfalfa 3aarsenic 3abarley 3adissociation 3afoods 3ageochemistry 3ahuman health 3arisk 3asoil 3atoxicity 3awater pollution 3awheat 3aIran1 aKeshavarzi, Behnam1 aMoore, Farid1 aHooda, Peter S.1 aBusquets, Rosa1 aGhorbani, Zohreh0 tEnvironmental geochemistry and health.g2020 Nov., v. 42, no. 11 p.3659-3673dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3870049x0269-40427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10653-020-00599-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03942naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245008600172500002200258520264900280592002802929650002002957650001002977650002102987650002303008650000903031650002903040650001103069650001303080650001503093650000903108650001303117650001803130650001003148653001303158653001403171653002003185653001203205700002703217700002103244700001903265773010403284856008703388852000903475655001203484IND60656091720221121050330.0190830e20190804xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065609172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.applanim.2019.1048402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBach, Monica H.10aEffects of environmental complexity on behaviour in fast-growing broiler chickens  aPre-press version  aModern broiler chickens spend a great proportion of their time resting, which poses a major threat to their welfare due to the increased risk of contact dermatitis and the incidence and severity of leg problems. Provision of environmental enrichment or manipulation of existing resources in the environment may increase the activity level of broilers and simultaneously improve their welfare. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of different types of environmental complexity on broiler behaviour. Five types of enrichment (elevated platforms with/without ramps, vertical panels, straw bales, roughage), three types of manipulations of the environment (two groups with differing increased distances between resources and one with reduced stocking density) and one control group were arranged in a randomised block design consisting of six blocks, each with 10 pens. Depending on the treatment, a flock of 422–497 broilers was housed in each pen. Fifty broilers from each pen were randomly marked and acted as focal birds for the investigation of behaviour on days 6, 13, 20, 27 and 34 of age using scan sampling with instantaneous recording. The percentages of broilers performing active behaviour and which active behaviour they were performing, as well as the use of enrichment, were investigated. Activity increased in the first two weeks of age when the distance between feed and water was increased, whereas the performance of specific active behaviour varied between treatments and ages. Compared to the control group, foraging behaviour increased when the broilers had access to maize roughage. In contrast, access to straw bales did not increase foraging, nor was any effect found on locomotion or standing. At days 6 and 27, reduced stocking density positively affected locomotion. Broilers used the platforms more frequently for standing, resting and performing locomotive behaviour, whereas foraging was performed more frequently on the maize roughage compared to any of the other types of enrichment investigated. Provision of elevated platforms also promoted the performance of comfort behaviour, indicating an improvement of welfare. The present study illustrated that the various types of environmental enrichment or manipulations of existing resources in the environment have different effects on the activity and behaviour of broilers. To decide on the applicability of the various types of environmental enrichment and environmental manipulations investigated, the effect on health, welfare and production parameters should be taken into consideration in addition to the results gained in the present study.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal behavior 3abales 3abroiler chickens 3acontact dermatitis 3acorn 3aenvironmental enrichment 3aflocks 3aforaging 3alocomotion 3arisk 3aroughage 3astocking rate 3astraw 0aActivity 0aBehaviour 0aBroiler chicken 0aWelfare1 aTahamtani, Fernanda M.1 aPedersen, Ida J.1 aRiber, Anja B.0 tApplied animal behaviour science.g2019 Aug. 04, dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl35407x0168-15917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.applanim.2019.1048403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02853naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245013100172300001600303520120800319592002801527650001501555650000801570650001301578650001801591650002001609650003401629650000901663650002401672650001901696650002501715650001401740650003001754653001901784653002601803653001401829653002201843653001201865653002401877653002301901653002101924653001201945653001401957700003201971700002702003700002702030700002302057700002202080773011602102856008402218852000902302655001202311IND60122872120221118004948.0150325e20140703xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012287212DNAL7 a10.1080/13887890.2014.9506982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFerreira, Sônia,10aNew EPIC nuclear DNA sequence markers to improve the resolution of phylogeographic studies of coenagrionids and other odonates  ap. 135-147.  aWhile phylogeographic data provide valuable information to inform conservation plans, there are comparatively few Odonata phylogeographic studies. This lack of research is partially due to a lack of independent DNA markers with appropriate levels of polymorphism that PCR-amplify in a range of species. We followed an exon-primed, intron-crossing (EPIC) PCR strategy to develop five new, polymorphic nuclear DNA sequence loci (six distinct DNA fragments) for the southern damselfly Coenagrion mercuriale. These markers were: cell division cycle 5 protein (CDC5), arginine methyltransferase (PRMT), acetylglucosaminyl-transferase (AgT), myosin light chain (MLC) and phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI). Between three and five of these new markers could be PCR-amplified in five other species from the genus Coenagrion ; one locus (PRMT) can be used in 26 other species of odonates that we examined, including three species of Anisoptera belonging to the genus Onychogomphus . These new nuclear genetic markers will be useful for phylogeographic studies in a range of odonate species, but also for phylogenetic studies, providing a particularly useful complement to the existing mitochondrial and nuclear loci.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCoenagrion 3aDNA 3aarginine 3acell division 3agenetic markers 3aglucose-6-phosphate isomerase 3aloci 3amyosin light chains 3anuclear genome 3anucleotide sequences 3aphylogeny 3apolymerase chain reaction 0aCoenagrionidae 0aCoenagrion mercuriale 0adragonfly 0agenetic diversity 0aintrons 0amultilocus approach 0anon-model organism 0anuclear DNA loci 0aOdonata 0aphylogeny1 aLorenzo-Carballa, M.

Although, the interplay between autophagy and ciliogenesis has been suggested, the role of autophagy in ciliogenesis is controversial and largely unknown. In this study, we investigated the effects of autophagy induced by BIX-01294 on the formation of primary cilia in human retinal pigmented epithelial (RPE) cells. Treatment of RPE cells with BIX-01294 caused strong elongation of the primary cilium and increased the number of ciliated cells, as well as autophagy activation. The elongated cilia in serum starved cultured cells were gradually decreased by re-feeding the cells with normal growth medium. However, the disassembly of cilia was blocked in the BIX-01294-treated cells. In addition, both genetic and chemical inhibition of autophagy suppressed BIX-01294-mediated ciliogenesis in RPE cells. Taken together, these results suggest that autophagy induced by BIX-01294 positively regulates the elongation of primary cilium.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautophagy 3ablood serum 3acilia 3aculture media 3acultured cells 3aepithelium 3ahumans 0aBIX-01294 0aAutophagy 0aCilia 0aCiliogenesis 0aATG61 aKim, Pan Soo1 aKim, Eun Sung1 aPark, So Jung1 aJo, Yoon Kyung1 aHwang, Jung Jin1 aPark, Tae-Joo,1 aChang, Jong Wook1 aSeo, Jin-Ho1 aCho, Dong-Hyung0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2015 May 01, v. 460 p.428-433dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2015.03.0503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03038naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245005300175300001600228520166700244592002801911650002201939650001501961650001001976650002401986650001202010650001302022650001902035650001102054650000702065650003302072650001502105653002402120653001002144653002302154653003202177653001902209653003302228653001902261700002502280700001802305700002402323700003402347773008202381856008402463852000902547655001202556IND60545151520221122053734.0160901e20140315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054515152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.watres.2013.12.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIsa, Mohamed Hasnain10aBoron removal by electrocoagulation and recovery  ap. 113-123.  aThis work investigated the removal of boron from wastewater and its recovery by electrocoagulation and hydrothermal mineralization methods respectively. The experimental design was developed using Box-Behnken Model. An initial study was performed based on four preselected variables (pH, current density, concentration and time) using synthetic wastewater. Response surface methodology (RSM) was used to evaluate the effect of process variables and their interaction on boron removal. The optimum conditions were obtained as pH 6.3, current density 17.4 mA/cm2, and time 89 min. At these applied optimum conditions, 99.7% boron removal from an initial concentration of 10.4 mg/L was achieved. The process was effectively optimized by RSM with a desirability value of 1.0. The results showed that boron removal efficiency enhanced with increase in current density and treatment time. Removal efficiency also increased when pH was increased from 4 to 7 and subsequently decreased at pH 10. Adsorption kinetics study revealed that the reaction followed pseudo second order kinetic model; evidenced by high correlation and goodness of fit. Thermodynamics study showed that mechanism of boron adsorption was chemisorption and the reaction was endothermic in nature. Furthermore, the adsorption process was spontaneous as indicated by negative values of the adsorption free energy. Treatment of real produced water using electrocoagulation resulted in 98% boron removal. The hydrothermal mineralization study showed that borate minerals (Inyoite, Takadaite and Nifontovite) can be recovered as recyclable precipitate from electrocoagulation flocs of produced water.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGibbs free energy 3aadsorption 3aboron 3aexperimental design 3ainyoite 3akinetics 3amineralization 3amodels 3apH 3aresponse surface methodology 3awastewater 0aAdsorption kinetics 0aBoron 0aElectrocoagulation 0aHydrothermal mineralization 0aProduced water 0aResponse surface methodology 0aThermodynamics1 aEzechi, Ezerie Henry1 aAhmed, Zubair1 aMagram, Saleh Faraj1 aKutty, Shamsul Rahman Mohamed0 tWater research.g2014 Mar. 15, v. 51 p.113-123dElsevier Ltdx0043-13547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2013.12.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02800naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002500189245006800214300001600282506007600298520120400374592002801578506003701606650002001643650001101663650001101674650002301685650002001708650001301728650001701741650001701758650002001775653002701795653002601822653002301848653002201871653002001893653002201913700002201935700002601957700005501983700002102038700002402059773012002083856008202203852000902285655001202294IND60533159720221207085056.0160728e20150501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053315972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2015.03.0512doi7 aPMC44450722pmcid7 a257963312pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aValle-Orero, Jessica14aThe elastic free energy of a tandem modular protein under force  ap. 434-438.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aRecent studies have provided a theoretical framework for including entropic elasticity in the free energy landscape of proteins under mechanical force. Accounting for entropic elasticity using polymer physics models has helped explain the hopping behavior seen in single molecule experiments in the low force regime. Here, we expand on the construction of the free energy of a single protein domain under force proposed by Berkovich et al. to provide a free energy landscape for N tandem domains along a continuous polypeptide. Calculation of the free energy of individual domains followed by their concatenation provides a continuous free energy landscape whose curvature is dominated by the worm-like chain at forces below 20 pN. We have validated our free energy model using Brownian dynamics and reproduce key features of protein folding. This free energy model can predict the effects of changes in the elastic properties of a multidomain protein as a consequence of biological modifications such as phosphorylation or the formation of disulfide bonds. This work lays the foundations for the modeling of tissue elasticity, which is largely determined by the properties of tandem polyproteins.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3adisulfide bonds 3aenergy 3amodels 3amolecular dynamics 3aphosphorylation 3apolymers 3apolypeptides 3apolyproteins 3aprotein folding 0aTandem modular protein 0aFree energy landscape 0aForce spectroscopy 0aTissue elasticity 0aProtein folding 0aLangevin dynamics1 aEckels, Edward C.1 aStirnemann, Guillaume1 aPopa, Ionel1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3111-47161 aBerkovich, Ronen1 aFernandez, Julio M.0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2015 May 01, v. 460 p.434-438dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2015.03.0513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03278naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245015700163300001800320520183100338592002802169650002202197650001502219650001502234650002202249650001402271650001202285650002002297650001202317650001402329650001402343650001102357650001802368650000702386650001902393650001402412650001302426650001302439650001102452650002302463650001802486650001002504650001302514700001802527773014902545856008102694852000902775655001202784IND60537159020221122010758.0160807e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053715902DNAL7 a10.1007/s13762-016-0983-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRanjbar, F.10aEmpirical and mechanistic evaluation of sodium exchange isotherms on natural mineral and organic adsorbents and organically functionalized nanoparticles  ap. 1891-1916.  aThis study was conducted to evaluate the efficiency of low-cost adsorbents including bentonite, kaolinite and zeolite saturated with calcium and potassium, potato and wheat residues, and three metal oxide nanoparticles functionalized with an acidic extract of potato residues in improving the quality of sodic waters. The optimization of factors such as pH, contact time, and adsorbent dosage was investigated using a solution containing sodium, calcium, magnesium, and potassium. The optimal pH and contact time were 7.0 and 24 h, respectively. The optimal dosage for using functionalized nanoparticles was 0.1 g and for using other adsorbents was 1.0 g. The sodium exchange isotherms were conducted in binary sodium–calcium and sodium–potassium and quaternary sodium–calcium–magnesium–potassium systems. Zeolite saturated with potassium was the most effective adsorbent in removing sodium from aqueous solutions with an average removal efficiency of 69.2 and 66.5 % in binary and quaternary systems, respectively. Freundlich and Langmuir equations fitted well to experimental data in both binary and quaternary systems. Cation selectivity coefficients calculated based on the Gaines–Thomas convention varied with changing pH and adsorbent dosage. Graphical and statistical evaluations confirmed that the mechanistic cation exchange model using average Gaines–Thomas selectivity coefficients in geochemical PHREEQC program was able to successfully simulate the sodium exchange on different adsorbents in both systems. The Gaines–Thomas selectivity coefficient values greater than unity and as a consequence, the negative values of the Gibbs free energy change of adsorption indicated that sodium exchange reactions in the presence of different adsorbents used is this study were exergonic and spontaneous.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGibbs free energy 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aaqueous solutions 3abentonite 3acalcium 3acation exchange 3acations 3akaolinite 3amagnesium 3amodels 3ananoparticles 3apH 3aplant residues 3apotassium 3apotatoes 3asodicity 3asodium 3asorption isotherms 3awater quality 3awheat 3azeolites1 aJalālī, M.,0 tInternational journal of environmental science and technology.g2016 Aug., v. 13, no. 8 p.1891-1916dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1735-14727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13762-016-0983-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03504naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245011700170300001600287520221100303592002802514650001502542650001302557650002202570650001502592650001602607650001502623650001502638650001702653650000702670650002002677653000802697653001202705653001602717653002602733653001702759700001802776700002102794700001402815700002302829700001902852773008202871856008402953852000903037655001203046IND60545151720221122033211.0160901e20140315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054515172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.watres.2013.12.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKreißel, Katja10aInactivation of F-specific bacteriophages during flocculation with polyaluminum chloride – A mechanistic study  ap. 144-151.  aBacteriophages are often used as surrogates for enteric viruses in spiking experiments to determine the efficiencies of virus removal of certain water treatment measures, like e.g. flocculation or filtration steps. Such spiking experiments with bacteriophages are indispensable if the natural virus concentrations in the raw water of water treatment plants are too low to allow the determination of elimination levels over several orders of magnitude. In order to obtain reliable results from such spiking tests, it is essential that bacteriophages behave comparable to viruses and remain stable during the experiments. To test this, the influence of flocculation parameters on the bacteriophages MS2, Qβ and phiX174 was examined. Notably, the F-specific phages MS2 and Qβ were found to be inactivated in flocculation processes with polyaluminum chloride (PACl). In contrast, other aluminum coagulants like AlCl3 or Al2(SO4)3 did not show a comparable effect on MS2 in this study. In experiments testing the influence of different PACl species on MS2 and Qβ inactivation during flocculation, it could be shown that cationic dissolved PACl species (Al13) interacted with the MS2 surface and hereby reduced the surviving phage fraction to c/c0 values below 1*10−4 even at very low PACl concentrations of 7 μmol Al/L. Other inactivation mechanisms like the irreversible adsorption of phages to the floc structure or the damage of phage surfaces due to entrapment into the floc during coagulation and floc formation do not seem to contribute to the low surviving fraction found for both F-specific bacteriophages. Furthermore, no influence of phage agglomeration or pH drops during the flocculation process on phage inactivation could be observed. The somatic coliphage phiX174 in contrast did not show sensitivity to chemical stress and in accordance only slight interaction between Al13 and the phage surface was observed. Consequently, F-specific phages like MS2 should not be used as surrogate for viruses in flocculation experiments with PACl to determine the removal rates of viruses, as the results are influenced by a strong inactivation of the bacteriophages due to the experimental conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aaluminum 3aaluminum chloride 3acoagulants 3acoagulation 3acoliphages 3afiltration 3aflocculation 3apH 3awater treatment 0aMS2 0aphiX174 0aCoagulation 0aPolyaluminum chloride 0aInactivation1 aBösl, Monika1 aHügler, Michael1 aLipp, Pia1 aFranzreb, Matthias1 aHambsch, Beate0 tWater research.g2014 Mar. 15, v. 51 p.144-151dElsevier Ltdx0043-13547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2013.12.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02779naa a2200709 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002900149245009200178300001400270500001500284520094000299592002801239650001401267650001901281650001101300650002301311650002101334650001501355650001101370650001201381650001201393650001601405650002201421650001201443650001801455650002301473650000901496650001401505650001301519650000701532650001901539650000901558650001001567653000801577653001201585653001901597653001601616653000801632653000801640653001601648653000801664653002201672653001201694653000901706653000901715653001001724653000901734653000901743653002401752653000801776700002001784700003501804700001601839773011001855856008301965852000902048655001202057IND60547024720221119073935.0161023e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054702472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ibiod.2013.11.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNiebisch, Carolina Heyse10aAssessment of Heteroporus biennis secretion extracts for decolorization of textile dyes  ap. 20-28.  a2019-12-06  aIn the present study, the dye-decolorizing properties of soluble extracts from the indigenous fungus Heteroporus biennis IOC4581 were determined. Decolorizing activity was associated with the secretion of a 45-kDa laccase. Laccase expression was extremely sensitive to carbon and nitrogen contents in culture media. Supplementation with metal ions and aromatic compounds resulted in extremely variable protein secretion profiles, although enzyme yields were not improved. Kinetic parameters of the soluble crude extract were promising, destaining seven out of nine textile dyes without the need of redox mediators. The extract was insensitive to Ca2+, Mg2+, Mn2+, and Zn2+ ions, and catalysis was enhanced in the presence of Cu2+ and Al3+ ions. The soluble fungal extract retained its maximal decolorizing activity at a wide range of pH (2.0–9.0) and temperature (4–50 °C), indicating potential application to dye biodegradation.  aPublisher supplied data 3amanganese 3adecolorization 3acarbon 3acatalytic activity 3anitrogen content 3ametal ions 3acopper 3acalcium 3afabrics 3atemperature 3aprotein secretion 3alaccase 3aculture media 3aaromatic compounds 3azinc 3amagnesium 3aaluminum 3apH 3abiodegradation 3adyes 3afungi 0aSMM 0aLaccase 0aBiodegradation 0aAbortiporus 0aMiP 0aSDS 0aTextile dye 0aLMM 0aReactive blue 220 0a2,6 DMP 0aEDTA 0aPAGE 0aRB220 0aions 0aABTS 0aHeteroporus biennis 0aMnP1 aFoltran, Camile1 aSerra Domingues, Rafael Campos1 aPaba, Jaime0 tInternational Biodeterioration & Biodegradation.g2014 Mar., v. 88 p.20-28dElsevier Ltdx0964-83057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ibiod.2013.11.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02804naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002400142245009400166520164100260592002801901650003001929650001201959650001501971650002501986650001302011650001202024650000902036650001502045650002202060651001702082700002002099700002602119700002302145700002302168700002302191773011802214856007702332852000902409655001202418IND60791007120221122165803.0220826e20220727xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079100712DNAL7 a10.3390/land110811712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBreed, Christina A.10aCould Purposefully Engineered Native Grassland Gardens Enhance Urban Insect Biodiversity?  aProgress is required in response to how cities can support greater biodiversity. This calls for more research on how landscape designers can actively shape urban ecologies to deliver context-specific empirical bases for green space intervention decisions. Design experiments offer opportunities for implemented projects within real-world settings to serve as learning sites. This paper explores preliminary ecological outcomes from a multidisciplinary team on whether purposefully engineered native grassland gardens provide more habitat functions for insects than mainstream gardens in the City of Tshwane, South Africa. Six different sites were sampled: two recently installed native grassland garden interventions (young native), two contemporary non-native control gardens (young non-native) on the same premises and of the same ages as the interventions, one remnant of a more pristine native grassland reference area (old native), and one long-established, non-native reference garden (old non-native). Plant and insect diversity were sampled over one year. The short-term findings suggest that higher plant beta diversity (species turnover indicating heterogeneity in a site) supports greater insect richness and evenness in richness. Garden size, age, and connectivity were not clear factors mediating urban habitat enhancement. Based on the preliminary results, the researchers recommend high native grassland species composition and diversity, avoiding individual species dominance, but increasing beta diversity and functional types when selecting garden plants for urban insect biodiversity conservation in grassland biomes.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity conservation 3agardens 3agrasslands 3agreen infrastructure 3ahabitats 3ainsects 3aland 3alandscapes 3aspecies diversity 3aSouth Africa1 aMorelli, Agata 1 aPirk, Christian W.

The concentrations of Ni, Co, Cd and Pb showed significant differences (P<0.05) in both periods. There was higher metal accumulation during drought season, possibly related to upwelling, since it produces an increase in primary productivity, which translates more food into organisms, making metals bioavailable for mussels.

The present study aimed to investigate the molecular events underlying inhibitory effect of N-Benzylcantharidinamide, a novel synthetic analog of cantharidin, on matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9)-mediated invasion in highly metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma Hep3B cells. In this investigation, among six analogs of cantharidin, only N-Benzylcantharidinamide has the inhibitory action on MMP-9 expression at non-toxic dose. The MMP-9 expression and invasion of Hep3B cells were significantly suppressed by treatment of N-Benzylcantharidinamide in a dose-dependent manner. On the other hand, the transcriptional activity of MMP-9 promoter and nuclear levels of NF-κB and AP-1 as the main transcriptional factors inducing MMP-9 expression were not affected by it although the level of MMP-9 mRNA was reduced by treatment of N-Benzylcantharidinamide. Interestingly, the stability of MMP-9 mRNA was significantly reduced by N-Benzylcantharidinamide-treatment. In addition, the cytosolic translocation of human antigen R (HuR), which results in the increase of MMP-9 mRNA stability through interaction of HuR with 3′-untranslated region of MMP-9 mRNA, was suppressed by treatment of N-Benzylcantharidinamide, in a dose-dependent manner. Taken together, it was demonstrated, for the first time, that N-Benzylcantharidinamide suppresses MMP-9 expression by reducing HuR-mediated MMP-9 mRNA stability for the inhibition of invasive potential in highly metastatic Hep3B cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantigens 3acantharidin 3adose response 3agelatinase B 3ahepatoma 3ahumans 3amessenger RNA 3ametastasis 3amortality 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 0aN-Benzylcantharidinamide 0aCancer 0aInvasion 0aMMP-9 0aHuR1 aChung, Tae-Wook1 aChoi, Hee-Jung1 aLee, Chang Hyun1 aEun, Jae Soon1 aHan, Young Taek1 aChoi, Jun-Yong1 aKim, So-Yeon1 aHan, Chang-Woo1 aJeong, Han-Sol1 aHa, Ki-Tae0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2014 May 02, v. 447 p.371-377dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2014.04.0353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02811naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245012400159520160700283592002801890650002001918650001601938650001901954650001501973650001501988650002502003650002102028651001002049700002402059700002302083700002002106700002002126700001902146700002402165700002302189773012902212856007502341852000902416655001202425IND60756196020221122182636.0211111e20211022xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075619602DNAL7 a10.3390/rs132142532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBeccaro, Lisa 10aMultitemporal and Multisensor InSAR Analysis for Ground Displacement Field Assessment at Ischia Volcanic Island (Italy)  aVolcanic islands are often affected by ground displacement such as slope instability, due to their peculiar morphology. This is the case of Ischia Island (Naples, Italy) dominated by the Mt. Epomeo (787 m a.s.l.), a volcano-tectonic horst located in the central portion of the island. This study aims to follow a long temporal evolution of ground deformations on the island through the interferometric analysis of satellite SAR data. Different datasets, acquired during Envisat, COSMO-SkyMed and Sentinel-1 satellite missions, are for the first time processed in order to obtain the island ground deformations during a time interval spanning 17 years, from November 2002 to December 2019. In detail, the multitemporal differential interferometry technique, named small baseline subset, is applied to produce the ground displacement maps and the associated displacement time series. The results, validated through the analysis and the comparison with a set of GPS measurements, show that the northwestern side of Mt. Epomeo is the sector of the island characterized by the highest subsidence movements (maximum vertical displacement of 218 mm) with velocities ranging from 10 to 20 mm/yr. Finally, the displacement time series allow us to correlate the measured ground deformations with the seismic swarm started with the Mw 3.9 earthquake that occurred on 21 August 2017. Such correlations highlight an acceleration of the ground, following the mainshock, characterized by a subsidence displacement rate of 0.12 mm/day that returned to pre-earthquake levels (0.03 mm/day) after 6 months from the event.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3aearthquakes 3ainterferometry 3asatellites 3asubsidence 3atime series analysis 3avolcanic islands 3aItaly1 aTolomei, Cristiano 1 aGianardi, Roberto 1 aSepe, Vincenzo 1 aBisson, Marina 1 aColini, Laura 1 aDe Ritis, Riccardo 1 aSpinetti, Claudia 0 tRemote Sensing.g2021 Oct. 22, v. 13, no. 21dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs132142533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03564naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002200155245015000177500002200327520199800349592002802347650002702375650002802402650002202430650000902452650001202461650001102473650001802484650001902502650004302521650002202564650001402586650002302600653002702623653001302650653003602663653002302699653001702722700002802739700002402767700010202791773011402893856009003007852000903097655001203106IND60656092220221121050302.0190809e20190804xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065609222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2019.1082892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTamburro, Manuela10aCharacterization of Listeria monocytogenes serovar 1/2a, 1/2b, 1/2c and 4b by high resolution melting analysis for epidemiological investigations  aPre-press version  aThis study aimed to characterize serovar 1/2a, 1/2b, 1/2c and 4b of Listeria monocytogenes cultures based on High Resolution Melting (HRM) profiles, targeting 53 fragments in the region comprising prs, Listeria Pathogenicity Island-1 (LIPI-1) and ldh loci, and 28 fragments of inlAB operon. Fifty L. monocytogenes cultures (28 of lineage I, 22 of lineage II) were tested. Real time PCR and EvaGreen-based HRM assays were performed, and the HRM profile for each amplicon was compared to that of L. monocytogenes EGD-e strain. Considering all fragments tested, 45 HRM profiles were identified (Diversity Index = 99.35). Similarity analysis identified two main clusters: the first consisted of 25 cultures, including all 1/2a and 1/2c strains, except for three isolates from food of serovar 4b; the second group only included 1/2b and 4b isolates. Eighteen out of targeted amplicons showed constant HRM characteristics irrespective of the serovar/lineage, and hlyA displayed the most stable melting behavior. Conversely, thirteen amplicons were specific for 1/2b and 4b isolates, showing variations mostly within actA, followed by prs, prfA, mpl and plcB. A fragment targeting an intragenic region (part of plcA and part of an unknown gene) had a melting profile allowing differentiation between 4b and 1/2b isolates showing with different Tm variants. Amplicons of inlA and inlB exhibited the largest intra-strain melting differences, and one inlB fragment could allow discriminating between 4b and 1/2b cultures, as well as between lineages. A greater level of genetic diversity amongst 1/2a cultures compared to 1/2c, 1/2b and 4b isolates was observed, with variation identified in LIPI-1, as well as within inlA and inlB genes. Sequencing analysis of amplicons with differential HRM profile from EGD-e confirmed point mutations. The study findings underlines that approach may be useful for bacterial subtyping for epidemiological purposes when sequencing-based methods are not available.  aPublisher supplied data 3aListeria monocytogenes 3aepidemiological studies 3agenetic variation 3aloci 3amelting 3aoperon 3apathogenicity 3apoint mutation 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asequence analysis 3aserotypes 3athermal properties 0aMolecular epidemiology 0aLineages 0aListeria pathogenicity island-1 0aInternalin A and B 0aSurveillance1 aSammarco, Michela Lucia1 aFanelli, Incoronata1 aRipabelli, Giancarlo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9953-7769 https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9953-77690 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2019 Aug. 04, dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl35565x0168-16057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2019.1082893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03590naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245012300162300001600285500002000301520199700321592002802318650002702346650001102373650002502384650001702409650002402426650001502450650002002465650001702485650001802502650001002520650002202530650002602552650001302578650002502591650004402616650002902660650001702689650002402706650001702730650002002747650002602767700002302793700002202816700002102838700002302859773009602882856007302978852000903051655001203060IND60523606020221117185617.0160623e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052360602DNAL7 a10.1890/10-0459.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCusack, Daniela F.10aChanges in microbial community characteristics and soil organic matter with nitrogen additions in two tropical forests  ap. 621-632.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aMicrobial communities and their associated enzyme activities affect the amount and chemical quality of carbon (C) in soils. Increasing nitrogen (N) deposition, particularly in N‐rich tropical forests, is likely to change the composition and behavior of microbial communities and feed back on ecosystem structure and function. This study presents a novel assessment of mechanistic links between microbial responses to N deposition and shifts in soil organic matter (SOM) quality and quantity. We used phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis and microbial enzyme assays in soils to assess microbial community responses to long‐term N additions in two distinct tropical rain forests. We used soil density fractionation and ¹³C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to measure related changes in SOM pool sizes and chemical quality. Microbial biomass increased in response to N fertilization in both tropical forests and corresponded to declines in pools of low‐density SOM. The chemical quality of this soil C pool reflected ecosystem‐specific changes in microbial community composition. In the lower‐elevation forest, there was an increase in gram‐negative bacteria PLFA biomass, and there were significant losses of labile C chemical groups (O‐alkyls). In contrast, the upper‐elevation tropical forest had an increase in fungal PLFAs with N additions and declines in C groups associated with increased soil C storage (alkyls). The dynamics of microbial enzymatic activities with N addition provided a functional link between changes in microbial community structure and SOM chemistry. Ecosystem‐specific changes in microbial community composition are likely to have far‐reaching effects on soil carbon storage and cycling. This study indicates that microbial communities in N‐rich tropical forests can be sensitive to added N, but we can expect significant variability in how ecosystem structure and function respond to N deposition among tropical forest types.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGram-negative bacteria 3acarbon 3acarbon sequestration 3acarbon sinks 3acommunity structure 3aecosystems 3aenzyme activity 3aforest types 3afractionation 3afungi 3amicrobial biomass 3amicrobial communities 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fertilizers 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aphospholipid fatty acids 3asoil density 3asoil organic matter 3asoil quality 3astable isotopes 3atropical rain forests1 aSilver, Whendee L.1 aTorn, Margaret S.1 aBurton, Sarah D.1 aFirestone, Mary K.0 tEcology.g2011 Mar., v. 92, no. 3 p.621-632dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/10-0459.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01752naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003000147245005900177300001600236520080000252592002801052650001001080650001801090650002101108650001401129650001901143650001101162650002901173650001301202700002701215700002101242773009401263856004801357852000901405655001201414IND50062640320221119144106.0130322e201302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006264032DNAL7 a10.1007/s11515-012-1242-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRajagopalan, Vidyalakshmi10aCytoplasmic dynein-2: from molecules to human diseases  ap. 119-126.  aThe dynein motor protein family is involved in a wide variety of functions in eukaryotic cells. The axonemal dynein class and cytoplasmic dynein-1 subclass have been well characterized. However, the cytoplasmic dynein-2 subclass of the family has only recently begun to be understood. We describe the entire dynein family but focus on cytoplasmic dynein-2. Dynein-2 consists of a heavy, an intermediate, a light intermediate, and a light chain. The complex appears to function primarily as the retrograde motor for intraflagellar transport. This process is important for the formation and maintenance of cilia and flagella. Additionally, dynein-2 has roles in the control of ciliary length and in non-ciliary functions. Mutations in the human dynein-2 heavy chain lead to cilia-related diseases.  aPublisher supplied data 3acilia 3adynein ATPase 3aeukaryotic cells 3aflagellum 3ahuman diseases 3ahumans 3amolecular motor proteins 3amutation1 aD’Amico, Jonathan P.1 aWilkes, David E.0 tFrontiers in biology.g2013 Feb., v. 8, no. 1 p.119-126dSpringer-Verlagx1674-79847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11515-012-1242-y  aDNAL 7aarticle03241naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245011300164300001600277520136200293592002801655650001301683650002501696650001801721650001801739650001401757650001701771650001201788650002001800650001001820650001201830650002501842650002701867650001801894650001101912650002001923650001101943650002101954650001201975650001701987650004002004653001002044653002502054653000902079653000802088653001002096653000802106653000802114653000802122653000802130653000802138653000802146653000602154653000802160653000802168653000802176653000902184700002102193700001502214700001802229700001602247700005702263773012002320856008202440852000902522655001202531IND60533160120221119065519.0160728e20150501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053316012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2015.03.0552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDo, Ji Yeon10aRetinal hypoxia induces vascular endothelial growth factor through induction of estrogen-related receptor γ  ap. 457-463.  aIschemic retinopathies causing overexpression of pro-angiogenic factors, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), are the most common cause of blindness. Thus, understanding the pathophysiology of targetable pathways that regulate retinal VEGF is of great interest. A conserved binding site for estrogen-related receptor γ (ERRγ) has been identified in the promoter of the Vegfa gene. ERRγ is a constitutively active orphan nuclear receptor and its expression is increased by hypoxic stimuli in metabolically active tissues. This study evaluated the role of ERRγ in the ischemic retina and the anti-VEGF potential of GSK5182, a selective inverse agonist of ERRγ. In an oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) mouse model, immunohistochemistry showed significantly increased ERRγ expression in the ganglion cell layer at postnatal day (P) 17. In a ganglion cell line (RGC-5), mRNA and protein levels of ERRγ were increased by desferrioxamine treatment and hypoxic conditions (1% O2). Transient transfection of RGC-5 cells revealed that ERRγ regulated Vegfa expression and this was inhibited by GSK5182. Intravitreal injection of GSK5182 into the OIR model at P14 inhibited retinal Vegfa mRNA expression at P17. GSK5182 suppresses hypoxia-induced VEGF expression via ERRγ; therefore, ERRγ could be a treatment target for ischemic retinopathies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagonists 3aanaerobic conditions 3aanimal models 3abinding sites 3ablindness 3adeferoxamine 3aganglia 3agene expression 3agenes 3ahypoxia 3aimmunohistochemistry 3aintravitreal injection 3amessenger RNA 3aoxygen 3apathophysiology 3aretina 3aretinal diseases 3atissues 3atransfection 3avascular endothelial growth factors 0aERRγ 0aIschemic retinopathy 0aVEGF 0aDFO 0aERRγ 0aGCL 0aHIF 0aIHC 0aINL 0aOIR 0aONL 0aP 0aPBS 0aPFA 0aSEM 0aVEGF1 aChoi, Young Keun1 aKook, Hyun1 aSuk, Kyoungho1 aLee, In-Kyu1 aPark, Dong Ho1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6911-37650 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2015 May 01, v. 460 p.457-463dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2015.03.0553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01360naa a2200265 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075024005100099040001800150100002000168245006600188300001600254500000900270500001500279520047300294592002800767650001100795650003700806653001100843773012100854852000900975856009800984655001201082991622917700742620221118004406.0191122e197011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7190107852DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci1970.0011183X001000060002x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThomason, R.

It is suggested that the basic protein variation is an indication of physiological differences existing in the barley seedlings grown at the different temperatures.  aPublisher supplied data 3abotany 3aPlant Science and Plant Products 0aplants0 tCrop science.g1970 Nov., v. 10, no. 6 p.618-620dCrop Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44570x0011-183X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2135/cropsci1970.0011183X001000060002x3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02367naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002400186245009800210300001400308506007600322520077700398592002801175506003701203650000801240650001501248650001501263650002001278650003201298650001901330650001201349650001101361650001901372650001401391650002201405650001601427700002601443700002101469700001701490700001901507700002101526700002001547700002001567700002501587700002701612773012201639856007901761852000901840655001201849IND60302157620221207101323.0150704e20140103xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6030215762DNAL7 a10.1126/science.12432112doi7 aPMC40476552pmcid7 a243106112pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCostantino, Lorenzo10aBreak-Induced Replication Repair of Damaged Forks Induces Genomic Duplications in Human Cells  ap. 88-91.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aDNA Damage Repair In human cancers, oncogene activation interferes with DNA replication, leading to DNA replication stress and DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). Costantino et al. (p. 88, published online 5 December) identified two subunits of DNA polymerase delta, POL3 and POL4, as critical for survival of DNA replication stress in human cells. Both subunits were required for break-induced replication (BIR), which is required to repair a specific type of DSB, with both subunits possibly required for processive DNA synthesis in BIR. Tandem head-to-tail duplications and fold-back inversions were seen in replication-stressed cells, similar to those seen in human breast and ovarian cancers, suggesting that BIR is important for repairing damaged forks in cancer cells.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aDNA damage 3aDNA repair 3aDNA replication 3aDNA-directed DNA polymerase 3aanimal ovaries 3abreasts 3ahumans 3aneoplasm cells 3aoncogenes 3aovarian neoplasms 3aplant ovary1 aSotiriou, Sotirios K.1 aRantala, Juha K.1 aMagin, Simon1 aMladenov, Emil1 aHelleday, Thomas1 aHaber, James E.1 aIliakis, George1 aKallioniemi, Olli P.1 aHalazonetis, Thanos D.0 tScience.g2014 Jan. 3, v. 343, no. 6166 p.88-91dAmerican Association for the Advancement of Sciencex0036-80757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.12432113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02071naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245015600169300001600325520093000341592002801271650001401299650002801313650001701341650001201358650001201370650002001382650001301402650000901415650002101424650001301445700002001458700001201478700001801490773009501508856008501603852000901688655001201697IND60087847020221121013821.0141102e20110701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008784702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2011.03.0432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYan, Jing-Kun10aPhysiochemical properties and antitumor activities of two α-glucans isolated from hot water and alkaline extracts of Cordyceps (Cs-HK1) fungal mycelia  ap. 753-758.  aTwo novel polysaccharides, WIPS and AIPS, were isolated and fractionated respectively from hot water and alkaline extracts of the mycelial biomass of a medicinal fungus Cordyceps sinensis (strain Cs-HK1). Through analytical and degradation experiments, WIPS and AIPS were characterized as α-d-glucans with a backbone of (1→4)-linked α-d-Glcp (>60%) and very similar molecular weights (Mw: WIPS 1180kDa; AIPS 1150kDa). WIPS had a short branch of (1→6)-linked α-d-Glcp (∼14%), but AIPS was a linear glucan, distinctive from the branched structures of most glucans from medicinal fungi. In aqueous alkaline solutions, both AIPS and WIPS exhibited a random coil structure with the similar conformational parameters but significantly different polydispersity indexes, 0.19 versus 0.37. AIPS exhibited much more significant antitumor and immuno-stimulatory effects than WIPS in animal tests on melanoma tumor-bearing mice.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCordyceps 3aOphiocordyceps sinensis 3aanimal tests 3abiomass 3aglucans 3amedicinal fungi 3amelanoma 3amice 3amolecular weight 3amycelium1 aWang, Wen-Qiang1 aLi, Lin1 aWu, Jian-Yong0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2011 July 1, v. 85, no. 4 p.753-758dElsevier Ltdx0144-86177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2011.03.0433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03333naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001500139245019500154300001800349520189200367592002802259650002502287650001202312650001202324650001702336650001602353650000902369650001702378650001502395650001402410650001002424650001402434650001102448650001102459650001302470650002902483650001702512650001002529650000902539700002302548700002502571700002402596700002302620773012402643856007502767852000902842655001202851IND60534703920221116190506.0160803e20130521xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053470392DNAL7 a10.1021/es400113y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJain, Ajay10aEffects of Deficiency and Excess of Zinc on Morphophysiological Traits and Spatiotemporal Regulation of Zinc-Responsive Genes Reveal Incidence of Cross Talk between Micro- and Macronutrients  ap. 5327-5335.  aZinc (Zn) is an essential micronutrient which affects plant growth and development in deficiency and can be toxic when present in excess. In Arabidopsis thaliana, different families of cation transporters play pivotal roles in Zn homeostasis. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of Zn in its deficiency (0 μM; Zn−) and excess (75 μM; Zn++) on various morphophysiological and molecular traits. Primary root length was reduced in Zn– seedlings, whereas there were significant increases in the number and length of lateral roots under Zn– and Zn++ conditions, respectively. Concentration of various macro- and microelements showed variations under different Zn regimes and notable among them was the reduced level of iron (Fe) in Zn++ seedlings compared to Zn+. Certain members of the ZIP family (ZIP4, ZIP9, and ZIP12) showed significant induction in roots and shoots of the Zn– seedlings. Their suppression under Zn++ condition indicated their transcriptional regulation by Zn and their roles in the maintenance of its homeostasis. Zn-deficiency-mediated induction of HMA2 in roots and shoots suggested its role in effluxing Zn into xylem for long-distance transport. Attenuation in the expression of Fe-responsive FRO2 and IRT1 in Zn– roots and their induction in Zn++ roots provided empirical evidence toward the prevalence of a cross talk between Zn and Fe homeostasis. Variable effects of Zn– and Zn++ on the expression of subset of genes involved in the homeostasis of phosphate (Pi), potassium (K), and sulfur (S) further highlighted the prevalence of cross talk between the sensing and signaling cascades of Zn and macronutrients. Further, the inducibility of ZIP4 and ZIP12 in response to cadmium (cd) treatment could be harnessed by tailoring them in homologous or heterologous plant system for removing pollutant toxic heavy metals from the environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3acadmium 3acations 3aheavy metals 3ahomeostasis 3airon 3aplant growth 3apollutants 3apotassium 3aroots 3aseedlings 3ashoots 3asulfur 3atoxicity 3atranscription (genetics) 3atransporters 3axylem 3azinc1 aSinilal, Bhaskaran1 aDhandapani, Gurusamy1 aMeagher, Richard

We studied the effect of placing soiled litter from strange males into the cage of another sexually mature male on the intensity of its digging and scattering, urination on the litter, and alteration in the levels of low molecular weight proteins (15–25 kDa) excreted in the urine before and after 4 days of exposure as determined by chip electrophoresis. The intensity of digging and scattering was positively correlated with levels of testosterone in serum of males exposed to strange male odors (r = 0.56; P < 0.01), as well as with the concentration of low molecular weight proteins in the donor’s urine (r = 0.52, P < 0.05). At the end of the experiment, the level of low molecular weight protein in excreted urine was elevated in the males exposed to the strange male’s litter. These results highlight the importance of quantitative inter-individual variation of low molecular weight urinary proteins in the modulation of the physiology and behavior of conspecifics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArvicola amphibius 3ablood serum 3acages 3acorrelation 3aelectrophoresis 3amales 3amolecular weight 3aodors 3aproteins 3asexual maturity 3atestosterone 3aurination 3aurine 3avoles1 aProskurniak, Lyudmila P.1 aYuzhik, Ekaterina I.0 tJournal of chemical ecology.g2016 Mar., v. 42, no. 3 p.270-276dSpringer USx0098-03317nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10886-016-0683-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01425naa a2200265 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075024005100099040001800150100002100168245005100189300001600240500000900256500001500265520055200280592002800832650001100860650003700871653001100908773012100919852000901040856009801049655001201147991622917830742620221118004320.0191122e197011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7190107882DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci1970.0011183X001000060005x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeiss, Martin G.10aGenetic Linkage in Soybeans: Linkage Group VII  ap. 627-629.  aepub  a2019-12-04  aThe genetic linkage between three loci in soybeans was determined, and established as Linkage Group VII.

The most common transplantation site in experimental islet transplantation is the kidney capsule. However, as less is known about the interaction of pancreatic islets with blood constituents, it also makes sense to utilize the portal vein approach in experimental islet transplantation. This protocol demonstrates an intraportal islet transplantation technique in NMRI nude mice. Streptozotocin (180 mg/kg) is injected intraperitoneally to induce hyperglycemia in recipient mice. They are considered as diabetic at a non-fasting blood glucose level greater than 20 mmol/L. One day prior to transplantation, mouse pancreatic islets are isolated from the donor pancreas by collagenase digestion; a minimum of 350 islets are utilized per diabetic recipient. Depending upon the islet isolation yield, two or more donor mice are utilized per recipient. After overnight culture at 37 °C, islets are administered into the recipient liver via the portal vein. After surgery, the mice are protected in red Makrolon houses and observed until are awake. This protocol maintains glycemic control for 120 days in syngeneic mice and 15 days in allogeneic mice.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal models 3ablood 3ablood glucose 3acollagenase 3adiabetes 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3aglycemic control 3ahyperglycemia 3aislets of Langerhans 3akidneys 3aliver 3amice 3aportal vein 3astreptozotocin 3asurgery1 aHussmann, Birte1 aRawat, Divya1 aGürol, Ali Osman1 aLinn, Thomas0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2018 May 05, , no. 135 p.e57559-e57559dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3791/575593Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/57559/intraportal-transplantation-of-pancreatic-islets-in-mouse-model  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03074naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245014300173300001600316520166500332592002801997650001002025650001802035650002202053650002102075650002202096650001602118650001502134650001402149650001302163650001502176650001802191650001202209650001102221650002002232650001402252650001602266650001402282650003202296650001002328650001802338700002402356700002402380773009802404856008102502852000902583655001202592IND60519206720221119090519.0160421e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051920672DNAL7 a10.1007/s10886-016-0682-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDesurmont, Gaylord A.14aThe Gastropod Menace: Slugs on Brassica Plants Affect Caterpillar Survival through Consumption and Interference with Parasitoid Attraction  ap. 183-192.  aTerrestrial molluscs and insect herbivores play a major role as plant consumers in a number of ecosystems, but their direct and indirect interactions have hardly been explored. The omnivorous nature of slugs makes them potential disrupters of predator-prey relationships, as a direct threat to small insects and through indirect, plant-mediated effects. Here, we examined the effects of the presence of two species of slugs, Arion rufus (native) and A. vulgaris (invasive) on the survivorship of young Pieris brassicae caterpillars when feeding on Brassica rapa plants, and on plant attractiveness to the main natural enemy of P. brassicae, the parasitoid Cotesia glomerata. In two separate predation experiments, caterpillar mortality was significantly higher on plants co-infested with A. rufus or A. vulgaris. Moreover, caterpillar mortality correlated positively with slug mass and leaf consumption by A. vulgaris. At the third trophic level, plants infested with slugs and plants co-infested with slugs and caterpillars were far less attractive to parasitoids than plants damaged by caterpillars only, independently of slug species. Chemical analyses confirmed that volatile emissions, which provide foraging cues for parasitoids, were strongly reduced in co-infested plants. Our study shows that the presence of slugs has the potential to affect insect populations, directly via consumptive effects, and indirectly via changes in plant volatiles that result in a reduced attraction of natural enemies. The fitness cost for P. brassicae imposed by increased mortality in presence of slugs may be counterbalanced by the benefit of escaping its parasitoids.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArion 3aBrassica rapa 3aCotesia glomerata 3aPieris brassicae 3achemical analysis 3acorrelation 3aecosystems 3aemissions 3aforaging 3aherbivores 3ainsect larvae 3ainsects 3aleaves 3anatural enemies 3aomnivores 3aparasitoids 3apredation 3apredator-prey relationships 3aslugs 3asurvival rate1 aZemanova, Miriam A.1 aTurlings, Ted C.

Moapa produced more and heavier seed and had a lower percentage of hard seed than Ranger. When seeds were scarified and grown for 22 days under similar conditions, regardless of seed density, Moapa seedlings emerged faster and were larger than Ranger, but Ranger seedlings developed leaves faster than Moapa. Seeds produced under cool temperatures were heavier and had a higher percentage of hard seed than those produced under hot temperatures. Seed produced under cool temperatures produced larger seedlings of Ranger, but temperature during seed production had little effect on vigor of subsequent Moapa seedlings. Seedling vigor of Ranger seed produced under cool conditions increased with decreasing soil moisture. Soil moisture had little effect on vigor of Moapa seedlings produced under hot or cool temperatures. Seedling vigor was increased with heavier seed density. Air temperature and soil moisture regimes during seed production not only affected seed yield, size, and germination but also influenced vigor of subsequent seedlings.  aPublisher supplied data 3abotany 3aPlant Science and Plant Products 0aplants1 aJensen, E.

Additionally, strategic and operational management of streams necessitates trade-offs between the recreational activities and values of tourists and riparian zone hospitality services. This paper aims to assist environmentalists and planners by exploring the effects of tourism-based recreational activities on ecosystem functioning along the drawdown zone. The study uses multivariate statistical techniques to delineate the relevant global tourism issues for planners. Kruskal-Wallis tests (p < 0.01) were conducted using quantitative data from 284 transects within the Three Gorges Dam Reservoir in China. The results revealed higher ecosystem function indices than tourism indices. Indicators of tourism contributed both positively and negatively to ecological indicators, with the Pearson correlation coefficients ranging from minor to moderate (r = ̶ 0.24 to 0.38, p < 0.05). Principal component analysis revealed that the critical variables of ecosystem functioning and tourism activities explained 72.26 % of the overall variance. Nevertheless, hierarchical cluster analysis revealed that these indicators responded differently in the upstream, midstream, and downstream sections. Our findings suggest that policymakers should consider the different characteristics of riparian zones in future planning, as doing so will improve both national and global strategic and operational management.  aPublisher supplied data 3acluster analysis 3adrawdown 3aecological function 3aecosystems 3aecotourism 3aenvironment 3aprincipal component analysis 3ariparian areas 3avariance 3aChina 0aEnvironmental management 0aTourism management 0aLand use planning 0aEcological indicators 0aNature protection 0aThree Gorges Reservoir1 aBehzad, Hamid M.1 aṬāhir, Muḥammad,1 aChangxiao, Li0 tScience of the total environment.g2022 Oct. 10, v. 842 p.156935-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1569353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01356naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245010400161300002000265520033600285592002800621650002700649650002300676650002200699650002000721650002300741650001400764700002200778700002300800773013600823856007400959852000901033655001201042IND60659683320221118061533.0190823e20121119xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065968332DNAL7 a10.1039/c2cc35995b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFucke, Katharina10aOvercoming the solvation shell during the crystallisation of diatrizoic acid from dimethylsulfoxide  ap. 12065-12067.  aWe present three crystal structures of diatrizoic acid (DTA) DMSO solvates illustrating progressive desolvation of the DTA molecule and concomitant increasing degree of DTA self-association.

This study uses multivariate vegetation data to describe vegetation—environment relationships in a set of riverine wetlands and then explores general relationships between pattern and process. Samples were collected from five marshes along the Ottawa River (eastern Canada) (n = 94 sample units). Detrended correspondence analysis was used to described major gradients, and TRWINSPAN was used to classify vegetation types. TWINSPAN produced four major classes dominated by Sparganium eurycarpum, Eleocharis smallii, Scirpus americanus, and Typha latifolia. Within each class, two associations could be recognized, differing in the degree to which one species managed to dominate the vegetation. Ordination showed that these vegetation types were arranged along two major axes: a standing crop and litter gradient, and a water depth gradient. Species richness was greatest just above the late August waterline in Eleocharis smallii vegetation that had low fertility, intermediate total biomass (250g/m²) and low littermass (30 g/m²). Very high biomass (>400g/m²) was observed where indices of high fertility and low disturbance coincided. Low species richness in this Typha—dominated vegetation is thought to be a result of competitive exclusion. Exposure to waves, ice, and flowing water produced a fertility gradient. The least fertile sites had small evergreen species such as Eriocaulon septangulare and Ranunculus flammula. These species possessed traits associated with Grime's "stress tolerator" strategy. The three main factors controlling vegetation competition were water depth, the effects of spring flooding in removing litter, and the fertility gradient produced by waves and flowing water. These were incorporated into a conceptual model including both patterns and processes observed along the Ottawa River.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEleocharis 3aEriocaulon aquaticum 3aRanunculus 3aSchoenoplectus americanus 3aSparganium 3aTypha latifolia 3abiomass 3acompetitive exclusion 3acorrespondence analysis 3afreshwater 3aice 3amarshes 3amodels 3arivers 3ashorelines 3aspecies diversity 3aspring 3atemperate zones 3avegetation types 3aCanada1 aKeddy, P.

The CRISPR technology has also been explored as novel therapeutics for a number of human diseases. Proof-of-concept data are highly encouraging as exemplified by recent studies that demonstrate the feasibility and efficacy of gene editing-based therapeutic approach for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) using a murine model. In particular, intravenous and intraperitoneal injection of the recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) serotype rh.74 (rAAVrh.74) has enabled efficient cardiac delivery of the Staphylococcus aureus CRISPR-associated protein 9 (SaCas9) and two guide RNAs (gRNA) to delete a genomic region with a mutant codon in exon 23 of mouse Dmd gene. This same approach can also be used to knock out the gene-of-interest and study their cardiac function in postnatal mice when the gRNA is designed to target the coding region of the gene. In this protocol, we show in detail how to engineer rAAVrh.74-CRISPR vector and how to achieve highly efficient cardiac delivery in neonatal mice.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aDependoparvovirus 3ahuman diseases 3aintravenous injection 3aserotypes 3amuscular dystrophy 3agene editing 3acardiac output 3aCRISPR-associated proteins 3amice 3acultured cells 3aanimal models 3agenomics 3aintraperitoneal injection 3amutants 3aneonates 3aRNA 3aexons 0atherapeutics1 aGao, Yandi1 aLau, Yeh Siang1 aHan, Renzhi0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2018 Aug. 02, , no. 138 p.e57560-e57560dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3791/575603Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/57560/adeno-associated-virus-mediated-delivery-crispr-for-cardiac-gene  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03386naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245018500165300001400350520169100364592002802055650001502083650002502098650002602123650002402149650002302173650002002196650002602216650001502242650001702257650001702274650002502291650001002316650001302326650003002339650001902369650001102388650001102399651001002410653001302420653002002433653000902453653000902462653001402471653001402485653001902499653001702518700001502535700002002550700005402570773010202624856008502726852000902811655001202820IND60568051720221118065142.0170628e20170801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056805172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2017.04.0662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeng, Han12aA comparison of denitrifying bacterial community structures and abundance in acidic soils between natural forest and re-vegetated forest of Nanling Nature Reserve in southern China  ap. 41-49.  aDenitrification plays a key role in converting reactive nitrogen species to dinitrogen gas back into the atmosphere to maintain the equilibrium of nitrogen cycling in ecosystems. In this study, functional genes of nirK and nosZ were used to detect the community structure and abundance of denitrifying microorganisms in acidic forest soils in southern China. Three sets of factors were considered for a comparison among 5 forests, including forest types (natural vs. re-vegetated), depths (surface layer vs. lower layer) and seasons (winter vs. summer). The community of nirK gene detected from these acidic forest soils was closely related to Proteobacteria especially α-Proteobacteria and uncultured soil sequences, while that of nosZ gene was affiliated with the α-, β- and γ-Proteobacteria. Higher diversity of denitrifiers was observed in re-vegetated forest soils than natural ones. Not only the community but also the abundance showed significant differences between forest types as well as depths. The abundance of denitrifiers ranged from 105 to 107 gene copies g−1 dry soil in this study. For nirK gene, the abundance was much higher in the lower layer than surface layer in both forest types, and the differences between winter and summer in natural forest soils were higher than those in re-vegetated forest soils. The abundance of nosZ and nirK genes showed a similar trend in natural forest, but the former was higher in matured forest than re-vegetated forest. This study provided a direct comparison on community composition and abundance of denitrifying bacteria in natural and re-vegetated acidic forest soils to allow further assessment of the nitrogen cycling.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacid soils 3aalpha-Proteobacteria 3abacterial communities 3acommunity structure 3aconservation areas 3adenitrification 3adenitrifying bacteria 3aecosystems 3aforest soils 3aforest types 3agamma-Proteobacteria 3agenes 3anitrogen 3areactive nitrogen species 3asoil sequences 3asummer 3awinter 3aChina 0aNitrogen 0aDenitrification 0anirK 0anosZ 0aAbundance 0aCommunity 0aChinese forest 0aAcidic soils1 aWu, Ruonan1 aWang, Yong-Feng1 aGu, J.-D.,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7082-97840 tJournal of environmental management.g2017 Aug. 01, v. 198 p.41-49dElsevier Ltdx0301-47977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2017.04.0663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03737naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002800150245011600178300001400294520182100308592002802129650002902157650001202186650001202198650001302210650001802223650001102241650001102252650002602263650001502289650001302304650000902317650001402326650002402340650001502364650002602379650001102405650001902416650001402435650001302449650001402462650003302476650002402509650000902533650002002542650001402562650001502576650000902591651001302600653002302613653002102636653002602657653002402683653001302707700002902720700002202749700002102771700002002792700002302812773013502835856008402970852000903054655001203063IND60122183620221117070211.0150325e20140102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012218362DNAL7 a10.1080/03067319.2013.7919762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHellar-Kihampa, Harieth10aConcentration profiles of metal contaminants in fluvial sediments of a rural–urban drainage basin in Tanzania  ap. 77-98.  aThis study investigated concentration profiles of trace, rare earth and platinum group metals in fluvial sediments from the Pangani river basin (43,650 km ²), one of the largest river basins in Tanzania, to assess its environmental quality. Sediment samples were collected in two distinct seasons from 12 representative sites of diverse land-use practices and characterised by ICP-MS after optimised microwave digestion. Ecological risks were assessed by evaluation of pollution index and comparison with legislated sediment quality guidelines (SQG). The results revealed contamination by some trace metals (e.g. Pb, V, Cu, Cr, Ni, Cd, As, Co, Mn and Zn) in concentrations ranging from 0.7 to 2940 mg kg ⁻¹, and four rare earth elements (Y, Ce, Nd, Yb) in concentrations ranging from 0.9 (Yb) to 500 mg kg ⁻¹ dry weight (Ce), which significantly exceeded the estimated background values at some stations. Palladium was the only platinum group element that was detected in quantifiable concentrations (0.3–3.5 mg kg ⁻¹). Concentrations of some trace metals exceeded the SQGs at some localised areas. Principal component analysis and multivariate correlations indicated geochemical characteristics of the area as the major control of metal concentrations and spatial variability. Organic matter and clay contents also played a significant role in metal distributions. Assessment of land-use practices upstream of the sampling locations was used to trace potential anthropogenic sources of metal enrichments, where highest levels were found in areas close to urban centres and agricultural activities. The study provides baseline data for future monitoring programs, and highlights the need for more comprehensive analysis involving a wider spatio-temporal scale and ecotoxicological risk assessment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropogenic activities 3aarsenic 3acadmium 3achromium 3aclay fraction 3acobalt 3acopper 3aenvironmental quality 3aguidelines 3aland use 3alead 3amanganese 3amicrowave treatment 3amonitoring 3amultivariate analysis 3anickel 3aorganic matter 3apalladium 3aplatinum 3apollution 3aprincipal component analysis 3arare earth elements 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3asediments 3awatersheds 3azinc 3aTanzania 0ametal contaminants 0asediment quality 0acontamination sources 0aPangani river basin 0aTanzania1 aPotgieter-Vermaak, Sanja1 aDe Wael, Karolien1 aLugwisha, Esther1 aVan Espen, Piet1 aVan Grieken, René0 tInternational journal of environmental analytical chemistry.g2014 Jan. 2, v. 94, no. 1 p.77-98dTaylor & Francisx1029-03977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03067319.2013.7919763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02349naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002500139245010100164300001800265520124200283592002801525650001401553650002401567650001401591650001901605650001401624650001901638650001901657700001701676700002101693700002201714700002001736700002301756773012401779856007501903852000901978655001201987IND60534704220170613000000.0160803e20130521xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053470422DNAL7 a10.1021/es400239k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAndersen, Stephen
J.10aDynamically Adaptive Control System for Bioanodes in Serially Stacked Bioelectrochemical Systems  ap. 5488-5494.  aMicrobial bioelectrochemical systems (BESs) use microorganisms as catalysts for electrode reactions. They have emerging applications in bioenergy, bioproduction, and bioremediation. BESs can be scaled up as a linked series of units or cells; however, this may lead to so-called cell reversal. Here, we demonstrate a cell balance system (CBS) that controls individual BES cells connected electrically in series by dynamically adapting the applied potential in the kilohertz frequency range relative to the performance of the bioanode. The CBS maintains the cell voltage of individual BES cells at or below a maximum set point by bypassing a portion of applied current with a high-frequency metal oxide semiconductor field-effect transistor switch control system. We demonstrate (i) multiple serially connected BES cells started simultaneously and rapidly from a single power source, as the CBS imparts no current limitation, (ii) continuous, stable, and independent performance of each stacked BES cell, and (iii) stable BES cell and stack performance under excessive applied currents. This control system has applications for not only serially stacked BESs in scaled-up stacks but also rapidly starting individual- and/or lab-scale BESs.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioanodes 3abioelectrochemistry 3abioenergy 3abioremediation 3acatalysts 3amicroorganisms 3asemiconductors1 aPikaar, Ilje1 aFreguia, Stefano1 aLovell, Brian C.,1 aRabaey, Korneel1 aRozendal, René A.0 tEnvironmental Science & Technology.g2013 May 21, v. 47, no. 10 p.5488-5494dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fes400239k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01433naa a2200241 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001600145245001500161300001200176520070200188592002800890650002200918650001500940651001100955773012500966856007901091852000901170655001201179IND60302157920221118033635.0150704e20140110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6030215792DNAL7 a10.1126/science.12477012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNurse, Paul10aEMBO at 50  ap. 117.  a50 years ago, in 1964, The European Molecular Biology Organization (EMBO) was founded by leading scientists who wished to create a network of cooperation in molecular biology.

In the context of this modelling approach, the growth kinetic parameters of maximum specific growth rate (μₘₐₓ) and lag phase duration (λ) were estimated using the Baranyi model, whereas the effect of temperature on μₘₐₓ was described using a secondary square-root-type model. The global model's goodness-of-fit indices of root mean square error (RMSE) and adjusted coefficient of determination (adjusted-R²) were estimated to be 0.206 and 0.948, respectively. The global model was then externally validated using growth data generated during storage of oyster mushrooms under dynamic temperature conditions. Specifically, the differential form of the Baranyi model merged with the square-root-type model was solved numerically using the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method in order to predict the Pseudomonas spp. concentration on mushrooms under fluctuating temperature conditions. The developed dynamic modelling approach exhibited satisfactory performance, with the mean deviation and the mean absolute deviation being −0.10 and 0.22 log CFU/g, respectively. Along with further substantiation and optimization, the developed model should be useful in food quality management systems, aiming in particular at the improvement of the microbiological quality of oyster mushrooms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPleurotus ostreatus 3aPseudomonas 3adynamic models 3afood quality 3akinetics 3amanagement systems 3amicrobiological quality 3amushrooms 3aprediction 3aspecific growth rate 3astorage temperature 0aGrowth kinetics 0aMicrobial spoilage 0aModelling 0aStorage experiments1 aTarlak, Fatih1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5351-18651 aLianou, Alexandra1 aOzdemir, Murat1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9025-30681 aZervakis, Georgios I.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2673-64251 aPanagou, Efstathios Z.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0317-11771 aNychas, George-John E.0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2019 Aug., v. 111 p.506-512dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2019.05.0623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02257naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147242007300166245007200239300001600311520083700327592002801164650002001192650002001212650001401232650001801246650001601264650001201280650001601292650001501308650002801323650001101351650002501362650001701387650001901404650002101423650001201444650001801456650001201474650002501486650001001511651002001521651001001541651001001551700001701561700001501578773008901593856004801682852000901730655001201739IND50070089520161205000000.0131022e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||fre||7 aIND5007008952DNAL7 a10.1007/s10298-013-0758-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBen Ghnaya, A.10a Ethnobotanical and phytopharmacological notes on Melia azedarach L.10aNotes ethnobotanique et phytopharmacologique sur Melia azedarach L.  ap. 284-288.  a“False Neem” (Melia azedarach L. 1753), Persian lilac or large lilac is a plant belonging to the family of Meliaceae.

Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) serve as city guts to receive and digest various human pathogens. Several techniques have been developed to detect human pathogens in WWTPs and to assess potential environmental risks. In this study, we employed 24 metagenomic DNA data sets derived from a high-throughput shotgun sequencing technique to more accurately and efficiently detect human bacterial pathogens in influent, activated sludge, and effluent of two Hong Kong WWTPs. Each data set was quality-filtered and normalized to 12 500 000 DNA sequences with a length of 150–190 bp. Then, a BLASTN search against Greengenes general 16S rRNA gene database and human pathogenic bacteria 16S rRNA gene database, a BLASTX search against human pathogenic bacteria virulence factor database, as well as MetaPhlAn analysis were conducted to survey the distribution, diversity, and abundance of human bacterial pathogens. The results revealed that (i) nine bacterial pathogens were detected; (ii) the overall pathogenic bacteria abundance was estimated as 0.06–3.20% in the total bacteria population using 16S rRNA gene fingerprinting; (iii) pathogenic bacteria detected in activated sludge and effluent shared similar profiles but were different from influent based on both 16S rRNA gene and virulence factor fingerprintings; (iv) Mycobacterium tuberculosis-like species may present potential pathogenic risks because it was detected with high abundance in both activated sludge and effluent. These findings provided a comprehensive profile of commonly concerned human pathogens in two Hong Kong WWTPs and demonstrated that the high-throughput shotgun sequencing technique is a feasible and effectual approach for environmental detection of human bacterial pathogens.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aMycobacterium 3aactivated sludge 3aanimal pathogenic bacteria 3adata collection 3agenes 3agenetic databases 3ahumans 3ametagenomics 3anucleotide sequences 3apublic health 3aribosomal RNA 3arisk 3asequence analysis 3asurveys 3avirulence 3awastewater treatment 3aChina1 aZhang, Tong0 tEnvironmental Science & Technology.g2013 May 21, v. 47, no. 10 p.5433-5441dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fes400275r3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02927naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245012800173300001600301520141900317592002801736650002001764650003501784650001601819650001901835650001501854650001001869650001901879650002501898650001801923650001301941650002701954650001101981650001601992653001802008653001402026653002702040653002202067653002002089653000902109700002502118700002302143700006702166773012202233856008102355852000902436655001202445IND60644099820221119052207.0200804e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064409982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2019.05.0632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPereira, Ana Paula M.10aInactivation kinetics of Bacillus cereus and Geobacillus stearothermophilus spores through roasting of cocoa beans and nibs  ap. 394-400.  aBacillus cereus and Geobacillus stearothermophilus are spore-forming bacteria of concern for the quality and safety of cocoa-based foods, because of their frequent occurrence in raw materials and the capability of spores to withstand heat processing. Cocktails of spores of B. cereus and G. stearothermophilus strains were separately inoculated on cocoa beans and nibs and roasted using a laboratory equipment at 110 °C, 125 °C and 140 °C for up to 600 min to simulate an industrial roasting process. The period of time needed for the first log-reduction δ for the spores of the cocktail of B. cereus in cocoa nibs at 110 °C, 125 °C and 140 °C were 92.2 min, 30.5 min, and 17.2 min, respectively. In cocoa beans at 110 °C, 125 °C and 140 °C δ-values were 148.5 min, 55.9 min, and 23.3 min. The δ-values for the spores of the cocktail of G. stearothermophilus in cocoa nibs at 110 °C, 125 °C, and 140 °C were 105.0 min, 39.6 min and 30.4 min, respectively, and 183.6 min, 76.2 min and 49.1 min in cocoa beans at the same temperatures, respectively. The aw of cocoa nibs and cocoa beans ranged between 0.687 and 0.753 before roasting, and between 0.355 and 0.528 after roasting, respectively. The roasting process on beans or nibs applied in the cocoa industry may have a limited effect on the inactivation of naturally present spore-forming bacteria.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus cereus 3aGeobacillus stearothermophilus 3acocoa beans 3acocoa industry 3acocoa nibs 3afoods 3aheat treatment 3alaboratory equipment 3araw materials 3aroasting 3aspore-forming bacteria 3aspores 3atemperature 0aFood spoilage 0aChocolate 0aSpore-forming bacteria 0aFood preservation 0aHeat resistance 0aFate1 aStelari, Henrique A.1 aCarlin, Frédéric1 aSant’Ana, Anderson S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5052-23150 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2019 Aug., v. 111 p.394-400dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2019.05.0633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02368naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245009900173300001200272520113400284592002801418650002201446650001601468650001501484650001301499650001401512650001201526650000901538650001901547650000701566650001301573650001501586650001301601650002301614700001701637700002401654700002901678700002601707773012301733856008101856852000901937655001201946IND60519207120221119090605.0160518e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051920712DNAL7 a10.1007/s11270-016-2843-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSoares, Micaela A.

This biosorbent contains a high amount of eggshell (30 % w/w; CES) and its performance was compared to mature compost without eggshell (CWES) and natural eggshell (ES). Sorption kinetics and equilibrium data were fitted to pseudo-second-order and Langmuir models, respectively. From a kinetic point of view, lead sorption into CES was fast, attaining equilibrium within less than 180 min. Batch experiments indicated that maximum sorption capacity of Pb into CES is 23 mg g⁻¹. The sorption capacity of CES was not significantly dependent on pH within the range of 2–5.5. In comparison to ES, organic matter of CES provided supplementary sites for lead sorption and an increase of 43 % in the sorption capacity was observed. Nevertheless, CWES was the biosorbent with higher sorption capacity. Still, this study points out the potential of new use of CES as an effective biosorbent to lead removal from aqueous matrices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaqueous solutions 3abiosorbents 3acomposting 3acomposts 3aegg shell 3agrasses 3alead 3aorganic matter 3apH 3apotatoes 3arice hulls 3asorption 3asorption isotherms1 aMarto, Sofia1 aQuina, Margarida J.1 aGando-Ferreira, Licínio1 aQuinta-Ferreira, Rosa0 tWater, air, and soil pollution.g2016 May, v. 227, no. 5 p.150-150dSpringer International Publishingx0049-69797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-016-2843-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03608naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245020000172300001500372500001500387520167400402592002802076650001302104650001302117650001302130650002502143650004302168650001902211650001902230650002002249650001502269650002702284650001802311650001202329650001202341650001102353650001202364650001202376650001202388650001502400650001402415650001002429650001902439650001902458650001802477650002702495650001802522650002102540650001202561650001602573653001802589653002502607653001002632700002002642700002302662700002102685700002202706773013702728856008402865852000902949655001202958IND60122184020221117065029.0150325e20140126xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012218402DNAL7 a10.1080/03067319.2013.7919772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarchanska, Hanna10aRapid determination of mesotrione, atrazine and its main degradation products in selected plants by MSPD – HPLC and indirect estimation of herbicides phytotoxicity by chlorophyll quantification  ap. 99-114.  a2019-12-04  aA matrix – solid phase dispersion coupled with high-performance liquid chromatography (MSPD – HPLC) method was developed for the isolation and determination of mesotrione, atrazine as well as its degradation products: hydroxyatrazine, deisopropylatrazine, desethyldesisopropylatrazine and deethylatrazine in plant. The method was applied to monitor not only herbicide accumulation levels but also the influence of herbicides accumulation on chlorophyll concentration in crops popular in moderate climate: rape (Brassica napus), radish (Raphanus sativus), carrot (Daucus carota), parsley (Petroselinum sativum), weeds: grass (Gramineae Juss), chamomile (Chamaemelium nobile) , thistle, (Carduus L .) and an aquatic plant hornwort (Ceratophyllum demersum L.). Chlorophyll was chosen as a biomarker of plant exposure to triazine and triketone herbicides because these compounds disturb the synthesis of chlorophyll that leads to reduction of this pigment content in plant tissues, which is manifested by whitening of the leaves and finally necrosis of a plant. The MSPD technique coupled with the HPLC–DAD lowers the detection limit of the aforementioned compounds below their maximum residual level (MRLs) 10 ng/g, according to European Union (Commission Regulation No 822/2009), the limits of quantitation (LOQ) were in the 1.0–3.0 ng/g range, while the recovery of analytes was 67–95%. All investigated herbicides turned out to be toxic for the considered terrestrial plant species. The herbicides at concentration of 100 ng/L, the maximum allowable concentration (MAC) in drinking water (Directive 98/83/EC), were innocuous for hornwort, an aquatic plant.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatrazine 3anecrosis 3aradishes 3aPetroselinum crispum 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aEuropean Union 3aBrassica napus 3adetection limit 3abiomarkers 3aCeratophyllum demersum 3aDaucus carota 3aPoaceae 3acarrots 3aleaves 3aclimate 3aparsley 3agrasses 3amesotrione 3achamomile 3aweeds 3adrinking water 3aaquatic plants 3aplant tissues 3amaximum residue limits 3aphytotoxicity 3aRaphanus sativus 3aCarduus 3achlorophyll 0aMSPD – HPLC 0adegradation products 0acrops1 aBabilas, Bozena1 aGluzicka, Karolina1 aZralek, Dominika1 aBaranowska, Irena0 tInternational journal of environmental analytical chemistry.g2014 Jan. 26, v. 94, no. 2 p.99-114dTaylor & Francisx1029-03977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03067319.2013.7919773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03453naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245012000162300001200282520200000294592002802294650001802322650001602340650001502356650002002371650003802391650001302429650003502442650002502477650001302502650005002515650001802565650001902583650001002602650002402612700001602636700001402652700001702666700001702683700001202700700001702712700001802729700001502747773011702762856008302879852000902962655001202971IND60757088520221120152720.0220910e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075708852DNAL7 a10.1186/s12917-021-03060-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Jun10aEstablishment of a peptide-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for detecting antibodies against PRRSV M protein  ap. 355.  aBACKGROUND: Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is one of the most economically devastating diseases affecting the swine industry globally. Evaluation of antibody responses and neutralizing antibody titers is the most effective method for vaccine evaluation. In this study, the B cell line epitopes of PRRSV M protein were predicted, and two peptide ELISA assays were established (M-A110-129 ELISA, M-A148-174 ELISA) to detect antibodies against PRRSV M protein. Field serum samples collected from pig farms were used to validate the peptide ELISA and compare it with an indirect immunofluorescence assay. RESULTS: The sensitivity and specificity of M-A110-129 ELISA and M-A148-174 ELISA were (111/125) 88.80%, (69/70) 98.57% and (122/125) 97.60%, (70/70) 100%, relative to indirect immunofluorescence assay. This peptide ELISA could detect antibodies against different genotypes of PRRSV including type 1 PRRSV, classical PRRSV, HP-PRRSV, and NADC30 like PRRSV, but not antibodies against other common swine viruses. The results of ROC analysis showed that the area under the curve (AUC) of the M-A110-129 ELISA and M-A148-174 ELISA were 0.967 and 0.996, respectively. Compared the concordance of results using two peptide ELISA assays, the IDEXX PRRSV X3 Ab ELISA and a virus neutralization test, were assessed using a series of 147 sera from pigs vaccinated with the NADC30-like PRRSV inactivated vaccine. The M-A148-174 ELISA had the best consistency, with a Cohen’s kappa coefficient of 0.8772. The concordance rates of the Hipra PRRSV ELISA kit, M-A110-129 ELISA and M-A148-174 ELISA in the field seropositive detection results were 91.08, 86.32 and 95.35%, relative to indirect immunofluorescence assay. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, compared with M-A110-129 ELISA, the PRRSV M-A148-174 ELISA is of value for detecting antibodies against PRRSV and the evaluation of the NADC30-like PRRSV inactivated vaccine, but the advantage is insufficient in serological early diagnosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aB-lymphocytes 3ablood serum 3acell lines 3aearly diagnosis 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aepitopes 3afluorescent antibody technique 3aneutralization tests 3apeptides 3aporcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome 3apork industry 3aseroprevalence 3aswine 3aveterinary medicine1 aZhang, Rubo1 aZhu, Ling1 aDeng, Huidan1 aLi, Fengqing1 aXu, Lei1 aHuan, Jianbo1 aSun, Xiangang1 aXu, Zhiwen0 tBMC veterinary research.g2021 Dec., v. 17, no. 1 p.355-355dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4152735x1746-61487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12917-021-03060-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02769naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245012000164300001600284520123600300592002801536650001501564650001801579650002801597650003301625650001701658650001901675650001201694650001501706650001401721650002201735650002501757650001101782653004301793653003901836653001901875653002001894653002001914700001601934700001901950700001301969700001801982700001502000700001702015700001802032773012102050856008302171852000902254655001202263IND60762944620221120201700.0220517e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076294462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2022.01.0432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Dangge10aHydrophobic, flexible electromagnetic interference shielding films derived from hydrolysate of waste leather scraps  ap. 396-405.  aWith the rapid development of wireless telecommunication technologies, it is of fundamental and technological significance to design and engineer high-performance shielding materials against electromagnetic interference (EMI). Herein, a three-step procedure is developed to produce hydrophobic, flexible nanofiber films for EMI shielding and pressure sensing based on hydrolysate of waste leather scraps (HWLS): (i) electrospinning preparation of HWLS/polyacrylonitrile (PAN) nanofiber films, (ii) adsorption of silver nanowires (AgNWs) onto HWLS/PAN nanofiber films, and (iii) coating of HWLS/PAN/AgNWs nanofiber films with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). Scanning electron microscopy studies show that AgNWs are interweaved with HWLS/PAN nanofibers to form a conductive network, exhibiting an electrical conductivity of 10⁵ S m⁻¹ and shielding efficiency of 65 dB for a 150 μm-thick HWLS/PAN/AgNWs film. The HWLS/PAN/AgNWs/PDMS film displays an even better electromagnetic shielding efficiency of 80 dB and a water contact angle of 132.5°. Results from this study highlight the unique potential of leather solid wastes for the production of high-performance, environmentally friendly, and low-cost EMI shielding materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acontact angle 3aelectrical conductivity 3aelectromagnetic interference 3ahydrolysates 3ahydrophobicity 3aleather 3ananofibers 3ananowires 3apolyacrylonitrile 3apolydimethylsiloxane 3asilver 0aElectromagnetic interference shielding 0aHydrolysate of waste leather scrap 0aNanofiber film 0aElectrospinning 0aPressure sensor1 aGuo, Shihao1 aZhou, Yingying1 aLyu, Bin1 aMa, Jianzhong1 aZhao, Ping1 aPan, Dingjie1 aChen, Shaowei0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2022 May, v. 613 p.396-405dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2022.01.0433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02355naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245010200161300001800263520117500281592002801456650002201484650001901506650000901525650001401534650001501548650002101563650001701584650001701601650001901618650001301637650001601650650002201666700002201688700002301710700001601733773012401749856007501873852000901948655001201957IND60534704720221116190615.0160803e20130521xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053470472DNAL7 a10.1021/es40031082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChandan, Payal
A.10aMorpholine Nitrosation To Better Understand Potential Solvent Based CO2 Capture Process Reactions  ap. 5481-5487.  aThe amine assisted CO₂ capture process from coal fired power plants strives for the determination of degradation components and its consequences. Among them, nitrosamine formation and their emissions are of particular concern due to their environmental and health effects. The experiments were conducted using morpholine as a representative secondary amine as a potential CO₂ capture solvent with 100 ppm standard NO₂ gas to better understand the nitrosamine reaction pathways under scrubber and stripper conditions. The role of nitrite in the nitrosation reaction was probed at elevated temperatures. The effects of different concentrations of nitrite on morpholine were evaluated. Formation rate, decomposition rates, activation energy, and the possible reaction pathways are elaborated. Thermal stability tests at 135 °C indicated the decomposition of nitrosamines at the rate of 1 μg/(g h) with activation energy of 131 kJ/mol. The activation energy for the reaction of morpholine with sodium nitrite was found as 101 kJ/mol. Different reaction pathways were noted for lower temperature reactions with NO₂ gas and higher temperature reactions with nitrite.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivation energy 3acarbon dioxide 3acoal 3aemissions 3amorpholine 3anitrogen dioxide 3anitrosamines 3apower plants 3asodium nitrite 3asolvents 3atemperature 3athermal stability1 aRemias, Joseph E.1 aNeathery, James K.1 aLiu, Kunlei0 tEnvironmental Science & Technology.g2013 May 21, v. 47, no. 10 p.5481-5487dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fes40031083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02651naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004000113040001800153100002100171245008700192300001600279520103400295592002801329650002101357650001301378650000801391650001201399650002101411650001401432650001501446650001601461650001101477650000901488650001901497650002401516650001901540650001801559650003701577650001601614650002001630650003901650650001401689650002501703653002101728653001501749653001401764653001501778700002201793700001901815700002701834700002201861773010601883856008701989852000902076655001202085IND50069538920221120091201.0200405e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006953892DNAL7 a239943102pmid7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2013.07.1382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWinkler, M.-K.H.14aThe biodrying concept: An innovative technology creating energy from sewage sludge  ap. 124-129.  aA full-scale biodrying installation was treating 150kton (wet weight) of dewatered waste activated sludge per year. The waste was treated at thermophilic conditions (65–75°C) in a 2-step forced aeration process reducing the total wet sludge weight by 73%. The final product had a high caloric value (7700–10,400 (kJ/kg)), allowing a combustion for energy generation in external facilities. The resulting product met the European microbial and heavy metal quality standards needed for an application as organic fertilizer. The facility used <0.5MW of electricity and recovered 9.3MW from biologically produced heat, which was internally used for the heating of office buildings. Produced ammonia, originating from the microbial conversion of organic matter, was recovered from the ventilated air in an acid gas scrubber as an ammonium sulphate solution 40% (w/w) (7.3kton/year) and was sold as substitute for artificial fertilizers.

Astronomers at the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope in West Virginia announced the discovery of the exotic stellar system this week. A pulsar is a spinning neutron star, the superdense leftover core of a supernova. As it whirls, it emits a beam of radio waves that sweeps the sky as steadily as the ticking of an atomic clock. By tracking tiny variations in the flashing, astronomers can tell the masses and motions of other bodies in orbit around it. Researchers hope to use that information to see whether Einstein correctly described the nature of mass, a basic tenet of general relativity.  aPublisher supplied data 3agravity 3aradio waves 3aresearchers 3aspinning 3atelescopes 3aWest Virginia0 tScience.g2014 Jan. 10, v. 343, no. 6167 p.126-127dAmerican Association for the Advancement of Sciencex0036-80757nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02812naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245018100171300001600352520132600368592002801694650002701722650002701749650002001776650001701796650001901813650001901832650001201851650002401863650001201887650001101899650001501910650002501925650001901950650001901969651001301988653003502001653002302036653002402059653001302083700002402096700002402120773010402144856008502248852000902333655001202342IND60568052420221118064845.0170708e20170801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056805242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2017.04.0732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZamasiya, Byron10aFactors influencing smallholder farmers' behavioural intention towards adaptation to climate change in transitional climatic zones: A case study of Hwedza District in Zimbabwe  ap. 233-239.  aThis paper examines factors influencing behavioural change among smallholder farmers towards adaptation to climate change in transitional climatic zones of Africa, specifically, Hwedza District in Zimbabwe. Data for this study were collected from 400 randomly-selected smallholder farmers, using a structured questionnaire, focus group discussions and key informant interviews. The study used an ordered logit model to examine the factors that influence smallholder farmers' behavioural intention towards adaptation to climate change. Results from the study show that the gender of the household head, access to extension services on crop and livestock production, access to climate information, membership to social groups and experiencing a drought have a positive influence on farmers' attitude towards adaptation to climate change and variability. The study concluded that although the majority of smallholder farmers perceive that the climate is changing, they continue to habour negative attitudes towards prescribed climate change adaptation techniques. This study recommends more education on climate change, as well as adaptation strategies for both agricultural extension workers and farmers. This can be complemented by disseminating timely climate information through extension officers and farmers’ groups.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural education 3aattitudes and opinions 3abehavior change 3acase studies 3aclimate change 3aclimatic zones 3adrought 3aextension education 3afarmers 3agender 3ainterviews 3alivestock production 3alogit analysis 3aquestionnaires 3aZimbabwe 0aClimate change and variability 0aFarmers' attitudes 0aSmallholder farmers 0aZimbabwe1 aNyikahadzoi, Kefasi1 aMukamuri, Billy B.,0 tJournal of environmental management.g2017 Aug. 01, v. 198 p.233-239dElsevier Ltdx0301-47977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2017.04.0733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02720naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245011200167300001600279520126600295592002801561650002601589650002301615650002501638650001501663650001601678650002001694650001101714650001501725650003101740650002201771650005801793650002701851650001001878653002601888653001501914653001601929653002701945700002201972700002001994700001702014773013802031856008402169852000902253655001202262IND60122184320221117070150.0150325e20140126xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012218432DNAL7 a10.1080/03067319.2013.8141232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGavin, Qi W.10aDevelopment of HPLC-MS/MS method for the simultaneous determination of environmental phenols in human urine  ap. 168-182.  aWe present a sensitive method for simultaneous determination of bisphenol A (BPA), benzophenone-3 (BP-3), 4- tert -octylphenol (t -OP), ortho -phenylphenol (OPP), four parabens (methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl parabens) and five chlorophenols (2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP), 2,5-dichlorophenol (2,5-DCP), 2,4,5-trichlorophenol (2,4,5-triclorophenol), 2,4,6-trichlorophenol (2,4,6-TCP), and triclosan (TCS)), in human urine by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) mass spectrometry (MS). Samples were processed using enzymatic deconjugation of glucuronides followed by solid phase extraction (SPE) on a C18 cartridge and the eluate was concentrated. Analytes were separated by reversed-phase HPLC and then detected by atmospheric pressure chemical ionisation (APCI) MS and quantified by isotope dilution method. We describe details for optimisation of each step of the procedure. The sample treatment steps are straightforward and not labour-intensive and, therefore, permit a high sample throughput with excellent prospects for automation. This method shows low inter-day variation, and detection limits for most of the compounds are below 1 ng/mL in 1 mL of urine. The method accuracy was also verified by the analysis of proficiency testing urine samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,4,5-trichlorophenol 3a2,4-dichlorophenol 3aatmospheric pressure 3aautomation 3abisphenol A 3adetection limit 3ahumans 3aionization 3aisotope dilution technique 3amass spectrometry 3areversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography 3asolid phase extraction 3aurine 0aenvironmental phenols 0aHPLC-MS/MS 0ahuman urine 0asolid-phase extraction1 aRamage, Robert T.1 aWaldman, Jed M.1 aShe, Jianwen0 tInternational journal of environmental analytical chemistry.g2014 Jan. 26, v. 94, no. 2 p.168-182dTaylor & Francisx1029-03977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03067319.2013.8141233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03057naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001800153245012400171520176600295592002802061650002802089650002802117650002202145650002502167650002802192650001602220650002102236650001902257650002402276653002002300653002502320653002202345653002902367700001302396700001702409700001702426773011902443856008802562852000902650655001202659IND60718492420221119012801.0220228e20210301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071849242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1436952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Chaoqun10aSoil organic carbon fractions, C-cycling hydrolytic enzymes, and microbial carbon metabolism in Chinese fir plantations  aThe mechanisms by which planting density affects soil organic carbon (SOC) fractions, C-cycling associated hydrolytic enzyme activities, and microbial carbon metabolism remain unclear. We evaluated the influences of five planting densities (D1: 1667 stems·ha⁻¹, D2: 3333 stems·ha⁻¹, D3: 4444 stems·ha⁻¹, D4: 5000 stems·ha⁻¹, and D5: 6667 stems·ha⁻¹) on the concentrations of SOC, microbial biomass carbon (MBC), easily oxidizable carbon (EOC), and dissolved organic carbon (DOC), the activities of invertase, cellulase, and β-glucosidase, and microbial carbon metabolism activities in 5- and 35-year-old Chinese fir plantations. Generally, no significant differences in the SOC and DOC concentrations among five planting densities in 5-year-old plantations were found, but the SOC and DOC were significantly higher in high-density plantations (D3, D4, and D5) than in low-density plantations (D1 and D2) in 35-year-old plantations. The EOC concentration in low-density plantations was lower than that in high-density plantations in both 5- and 35-year-old plantations. The high planting density was associated with higher MBC, activities of invertase and β-glucosidase, and microbial carbon metabolism activity in 5-year-old plantations, but the opposite was found in 35-year-old plantations. The high-density plantations exhibited a significant decrease in cellulase activity in 35-year-old plantations. These results highlight that although increased planting density would enrich SOC storage after a long-term rotation of plantations, it also reduces microbial and enzymatic activities. This has important implications in the formulation of planting density management strategies to increase SOC stocks while maintaining soil fertility.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCunninghamia lanceolata 3abeta-fructofuranosidase 3acarbon metabolism 3acarbon sequestration 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3aenvironment 3amicrobial carbon 3asoil fertility 3asoil organic carbon 0aSoil properties 0aMicrobial metabolism 0aForest management 0aOrganic carbon fractions1 aXue, Lin1 aDong, Yuhong1 aJiao, Ruzhen0 tScience of the total environment.g2021 Mar. 01, v. 758 p.143695-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1436953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02810naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002400166245008800190300001600278520151400294592002801808650000901836650000901845650001301854650001001867650002401877650001401901650003101915650001301946650001001959650001201969650003701981650003202018650003302050650003702083650004002120700002302160700002002183773008302203856008102286852000902367655001202376IND50070090320221118222304.0150209e200912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007009032DNAL7 a201351922pmid7 a10.1007/s10393-009-0272-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVenesky, Matthew D.10aImpacts of Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis Infection on Tadpole Foraging Performance  ap. 565-575.  aPathogen-induced modifications in host behavior, including alterations in foraging behavior or foraging efficiency, can compromise host fitness by reducing growth and development. Chytridiomycosis is an infectious disease of amphibians caused by the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), and it has played an important role in the worldwide decline of amphibians. In larval anurans, Bd infections commonly result in reduced developmental rates, however, the mechanism(s) responsible are untested. We conducted laboratory experiments to test whether Bd infections reduced foraging performance of Grey Treefrog (Hyla chrysoscelis) and Fowler’s Toad (Anaxyrus [= Bufo] fowleri) tadpoles. In the first experiment, we observed foraging behavior of Bd-infected and uninfected tadpoles to test for differences in foraging activity. In a second experiment, we tested for differences in the ingestion rates of tadpoles by examining the amount of food in their alimentary track after a 3-hour foraging period. We hypothesized that Bd-infected tadpoles would forage less often and less efficiently than uninfected tadpoles. As predicted, Bd-infected larvae forage less often and were less efficient at obtaining food than uninfected larvae. Our results show that Bd infections reduce foraging efficiency in Anaxyrus and Hyla tadpoles, and that Bd differentially affects foraging behavior in these species.

Nanoemulsions are thermodynamically unstable systems, so an emulsifier is necessary to maintain their stability during processing and storage. The aim of this work was to study the replacement of a synthetic emulsifier (Tw80: Tween 80) with one of natural origin (QS: quillaja saponins), evaluating its effect on the physical stability of nanoemulsions under different treatments (ionic strength and temperature). Avocado oil-based nanoemulsions were prepared using different emulsifier mixtures: 5% soy lecithin (SL) and 1% Tw80, which was replaced by different QS proportions (1:0, 3:1, 1:1, 1:3, 0:1 Tw80:QS). Results showed that by increasing QS proportion particle size, polydispersity index and electronegativity of nanoemulsions also increased. All nanoemulsions remain stable after centrifugation process, since no creaming formation was observed. The ionic strength treatment had an effect on zeta potential values, but not on PS. The incorporation of quillaja saponin in nanoemulsions increases their thermal stability. Thus, the ternary emulsifier mixture (Tw80-QS-SL) can be used in the elaboration of pasteurized and sterilized emulsion-based food products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aQuillaja 3aavocados 3acentrifugation 3aconsumer demand 3acreaming 3aemulsifiers 3afood industry 3afoods 3aingredients 3aionic strength 3alecithins 3ananoemulsions 3aparticle size 3apasteurization 3apolysorbates 3asaponins 3atemperature 3athermal stability 3azeta potential 0aTween 80 0aQuillaja saponin 0aSoy lecithin 0aEmulsifier mixture 0aNanoemulsions1 aZúñiga, R.N.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4195-80851 aArancibia, C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2174-34740 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2019 Aug., v. 111 p.760-766dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2019.05.0673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02373naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005400151245014900205300001400354520097000368592002801338650001701366650002201383650001501405650002201420650002001442650001101462650001301473653003101486653003901517653003101556653002101587653003001608653001601638653003401654653002901688700002101717700002201738773009701760856008501857852000901942655001201951IND60547435520221120195827.0160903e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054743552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envsoft.2014.11.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Xuyuan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0533-355210aImproved PMI-based input variable selection approach for artificial neural network and other data driven environmental and water resource models  ap. 15-29.  aInput variable selection (IVS) is one of the most important steps in the development of artificial neural network and other data driven environmental and water resources models. Partial mutual information (PMI) is one of the most promising approaches to IVS, but has the disadvantage of requiring kernel density estimates (KDEs) of the data to be obtained, which can become problematic when the data are non-normally distributed, as is often the case for environmental and water resources problems. In order to overcome this issue, preliminary guidelines for the selection of the most appropriate methods for obtaining the required KDEs are determined based on the results of 3780 trials using synthetic data with distributions of varying degrees of non-normality and six different KDE techniques. The validity of the guidelines is confirmed for two semi-real case studies developed based on the forecasting of river salinity and rainfall-runoff modelling problems.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3acomputer software 3aguidelines 3ahydrologic models 3aneural networks 3arivers 3asalinity 0aArtificial neural networks 0aGeneral regression neural networks 0aPartial mutual information 0aKernel bandwidth 0aKernel density estimation 0aEnvironment 0aHydrology and water resources 0aInput variable selection1 aMaier, Holger R.1 aZecchin, Aaron C.0 tEnvironmental modelling & software.g2015 Mar., v. 65 p.15-29dElsevier Ltdx1364-81527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2014.11.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02510naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002700151245012000178520110800298592002801406650001301434650001701447650001201464650002001476650002201496650001601518650001101534650002001545650001701565650001601582650001701598650002001615650002001635651001901655651001101674653002501685653003401710653001901744653002201763653001101785653001101796700002401807773011401831856008601945852000902031655001202040IND60686707420221119004121.0201104e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068670742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envsoft.2020.1046932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShuler, Christopher K.10aCollaborative groundwater modeling: Open-source, cloud-based, applied science at a small-island water utility scale  aRecent advances in cloud-computing and social-networking are influencing how we communicate professionally, work collaboratively, and approach data-science tasks. Here we show how the groundwater modeling field is well positioned to benefit from these advances. We present a case study detailing a vertically-integrated, collaborative modeling framework jointly developed by participants at the American Samoa Power Authority and at the University of Hawaii Water Resources Research Center. The framework components include direct collection and analysis of climate and streamflow data, development of a water budget model, and initiation of a dynamic groundwater modeling process. The framework is entirely open-source and applies newly available data-science infrastructure using Python-based tools compiled with Jupyter Notebooks and cloud computing services such as GitHub. These resources allow for seamless integration of multiple computational components into a dynamic cloud-based workflow that is immediately accessible to stakeholders, resource managers, or anyone with an internet connection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3acase studies 3aclimate 3acloud computing 3acomputer software 3agroundwater 3amodels 3asocial networks 3astakeholders 3astream flow 3awater budget 3awater resources 3awater utilities 3aAmerican Samoa 3aHawaii 0aGroundwater modeling 0aHydrologic monitoring network 0aAmerican Samoa 0aJupyter Notebooks 0aGitHub 0aPython1 aMariner, Katrina E.0 tEnvironmental modelling & software.g2020 May, v. 127 p.104693-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11634x1364-81527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2020.1046933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02679naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245009000177300001600267520125000283592002801533650001901561650001501580650001701595650001701612650002601629650001501655650001501670650003001685650003701715650001601752650002701768650001401795651001801809651001401827651001101841653001701852653002001869653001701889653000901906653000801915700001601923700002401939700002401963773010401987856008502091852000902176655001202185IND60568052620221118065050.0170708e20170801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056805262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2017.04.0752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPedersen, Kristine B.10aSimultaneous electrodialytic removal of PAH, PCB, TBT and heavy metals from sediments  ap. 192-202.  aContaminated sediments are remediated in order to protect human health and the environment, with the additional benefit of using the treated sediments for other activities. Common for many polluted sediments is the contamination with several different pollutants, making remediation challenging with the need of different remedial actions for each pollutant. In this study, electrodialytic remediation (EDR) of sediments was found effective for simultaneous removal of heavy metals and organic pollutants for sediments from Arctic regions – Sisimiut in Greenland and Hammerfest in Norway. The influence of sediment properties and experimental settings on the remediation process was studied by employing multivariate analysis. The importance of the variables studied varied with the pollutant and based on these results it was possible to assess removal processes for the different pollutants. Desorption was found to be important for the removal of heavy metals and TBT, while photolysis was significant for removal of PAH, PCB and TBT. In addition, dechlorination was found to be important for the removal of PCB. The highest removal efficiencies were found for heavy metals, TBT and PCB (>40%) and lower removal efficiencies for PAH (<35%).  aPublisher supplied data 3adechlorination 3adesorption 3aheavy metals 3ahuman health 3amultivariate analysis 3aphotolysis 3apollutants 3apolychlorinated biphenyls 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3aremediation 3asediment contamination 3asediments 3aArctic region 3aGreenland 3aNorway 0aChemometrics 0aElectrokinetics 0aHeavy metals 0aPOPs 0aTBT1 aLejon, Tore1 aJensen, Pernille E.1 aOttosen, Lisbeth M.0 tJournal of environmental management.g2017 Aug. 01, v. 198 p.192-202dElsevier Ltdx0301-47977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2017.04.0753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01627naa a2200265 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075024005100099040001800150100002000168245007300188300001600261500000900277500001500286520073300301592002801034650001101062650003701073653001101110773012101121852000901242856009801251655001201349991622915990742620221118004454.0191122e197011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7190108102DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci1970.0011183X001000060028x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTownsend, C.

Simple correlation coefficients were calculated between vigor and the other characters. Height and date of flowering were highly correlated with vigor in the seedling year. The origin oE 11 accessions was traced to a single introduction (P.I. 66,515) made in 1926.

Consequently, gap-filling solutions are needed for accurate crop phenology characterization. The here presented Decomposition and Analysis of Time Series software (DATimeS) expands established time series interpolation methods with a diversity of advanced machine learning fitting algorithms (e.g., Gaussian Process Regression: GPR) particularly effective for the reconstruction of multiple-seasons vegetation temporal patterns. DATimeS is freely available as a powerful image time series software that generates cloud-free composite maps and captures seasonal vegetation dynamics from regular or irregular satellite time series. This work describes the main features of DATimeS, and provides a demonstration case using Sentinel-2 Leaf Area Index time series data over a Spanish site. GPR resulted as an optimum fitting algorithm with most accurate gap-filling performance and associated uncertainties. DATimeS further quantified LAI fluctuations among multiple crop seasons and provided phenological indicators for specific crop types.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aartificial intelligence 3acloud cover 3acomputer software 3aleaf area index 3amultiple cropping 3anormal distribution 3aphenology 3aremote sensing 3asatellites 3atime series analysis 3auncertainty 3avegetation 0aGap-filling 0aMachine learning 0aVegetation phenology 0aRemote sensing1 aPipia, Luca1 aMorcillo-Pallarés, Pablo1 aRivera-Caicedo, Juan Pablo1 aAmin, Eatidal1 aDe Grave, Charlotte1 aVerrelst, Jochem0 tEnvironmental modelling & software.g2020 May, v. 127 p.104666-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11634x1364-81527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2020.1046663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03358naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245011300169300001600282520191800298592002802216650002102244650001102265650002702276650001002303650001902313650001402332650000902346650002002355650001302375650001802388650002002406650002102426650002102447650001502468650002502483653000802508653001302516653001102529653001702540653001702557653001602574700001602590700006002606773010402666856008502770852000902855655001202864IND60568052820221118065027.0170708e20170801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056805282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2017.04.0772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChavaco, L.C.10aDecolorization of reactive dyes in solar pond reactors: Perspectives and challenges for the textile industry  ap. 203-212.  aIn the past three decades, Fenton and photo-Fenton processes have been the subject of a large number of research studies aimed at developing a low-cost and robust alternative to treat complex wastewater. Aspects such as installation and operating costs and technical complexity of reactors have limited the commercial applications of Fenton processes. In this study, we evaluated the potential of solar pond reactors to carry out degradation of the dye reactive orange 16 (RO16). Decolorization (D = 99 ± 0.6%), chemical oxygen demand reduction (COD = 55 ± 2%), total organic carbon removal (TOC = 28 ± 0.5%), and biocompatibilization can be accomplished using 15% peroxide (0.6 mg H2O2/mg RO16), which is theoretically required to mineralize the dye. Under dark conditions, decolorization and aromatic removal were scarcely affected (2%), whereas COD and TOC removal were reduced to 37% and 16%, respectively. The application of multivariable analysis and the use of low-cost reactors may lead to a reduction in annual treatment costs of colored effluents to 0.76 (US/m3). Furthermore, the treatment capacity can be increased from 0.6 m3 wastewater/m2 reactor surface to 1.7 m3 wastewater/m2 reactor surface without compromising process efficiency or the biodegradability (BOD5/COD ratio) of the effluent. Dyeing auxiliaries, mainly NaCl, appreciably reduced the decolorization performance in Fenton (13 ± 0.4%) and photo-Fenton (83 ± 0.5%) processes due to the formation of iron-chloride complexes and less powerful oxidants. To reduce the impact of auxiliary agents on process performance and treatment capacity, the Fe2+ concentration should be increased from 5 mg/L to 15 mg/L. The results seem promising; however, additional studies at pilot and semi-industrial scales should be conducted to demonstrate the potential of low-cost reactors to carry out colored wastewater treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodegradability 3acarbon 3achemical oxygen demand 3acolor 3adecolorization 3aeffluents 3airon 3aoperating costs 3aoxidants 3areactive dyes 3asodium chloride 3asolar collectors 3atextile industry 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 0aAzo 0aDye bath 0aFenton 0aPhoto-Fenton 0aReactive dye 0aSolar ponds1 aArcos, C.A.1 aPrato-Garcia, D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0264-33980 tJournal of environmental management.g2017 Aug. 01, v. 198 p.203-212dElsevier Ltdx0301-47977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2017.04.0773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02741naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245021700166300001600383520122200399592002801621650001501649650001501664650002201679650003501701650002101736650002001757650002201777650000901799650000901808650000701817650002701824650003701851653004301888653002201931653002701953653002301980653006102003700001202064773013802076856008402214852000902298655001202307IND60122184720221117065250.0150325e20140219xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012218472DNAL7 a10.1080/03067319.2013.7919812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Zhenhua10aSynthesis, characterisation and application of 4-Aminoazobenzene functionalised multiwalled carbon nanotubes as a novel and uniquely selective solid-phase extraction for determination of lead(II) in water samples  ap. 291-303.  aMultiwalled carbon nanotubes modified with 4-Aminoazobenzene was prepared and applied to the separation, preconcentration and determination of Pb(II) in aqueous solutions by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry. Characterisation of the surface modiﬁcation was performed on the basis of transmission electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectra and elemental analysis. The effects of pH, the sample flow rate and volume, the elution condition and the interfering ions were examined using batch and column procedures in detail. Under the optimised conditions (pH 5.0, flow rate 2.0 mL min ⁻¹), Pb(II) retained on the column can be quantitatively eluted by 2.0 mL 0.1 mol L ⁻¹ HCl. An enrichment factor of 150 was accomplished. Common interfering ions did not interfere in both the separation and determination. The maximum adsorption capacity of the adsorbent at optimum conditions was found to be 46.8 mg g ⁻¹. The detection limit (3σ) was 0.28 μg L ⁻¹, and the relative standard deviation (RSD) was 2.1% (n = 11). The method was validated using certified reference materials, and has been applied for the determination of trace Pb(II) with satisfactory results.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aaqueous solutions 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3acarbon nanotubes 3adetection limit 3ahydrochloric acid 3aions 3alead 3apH 3asolid phase extraction 3atransmission electron microscopy 0amodiﬁed multiwalled carbon nanotubes 0a4-Aminoazobenzene 0asolid-phase extraction 0alead determination 0ainductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry1 aWu, Lan0 tInternational journal of environmental analytical chemistry.g2014 Feb. 19, v. 94, no. 3 p.291-303dTaylor & Francisx1029-03977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03067319.2013.7919813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03330naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006500147245015300212300001600365520167300381592002802054650001902082650002602101650001202127650002502139650002102164650001202185650002302197650002702220650001002247650001802257650002502275650001202300650001202312650000902324650002002333650001202353650001202365650002902377653001102406653001302417653001102430653002802441653003202469653001102501700002802512700003002540700002902570773009802599856008202697852000902779655001202788IND60644100520221117162402.0190718e20190715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064410052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lfs.2019.05.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMori, Rosana Cristina1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8118-625410aCarbenoxolone enhances peripheral insulin sensitivity and GLUT4 expression in skeletal muscle of obese rats: Potential participation of UBC9 protein  ap. 157-165.  aThis study investigates the insulin sensitizer effect of carbenoxolone (CBX) and potentially involved peripheral mechanisms.Taking glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) as a marker of glucose disposal, we investigated the CBX effects on whole-body insulin sensitivity and solute carrier 2a4 (Slc2a4)/GLUT4 expression in visceral (VAT) and subcutaneous (SAT) adipose tissues and soleus muscle of monosodium glutamate (MSG)-induced obese rats. Sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP1), an enhancer of Slc2a4 expression was analyzed through mRNA content and SREBP1-binding to Slc2a4 promoter. Finally, the small ubiquitin-modifier conjugating enzyme 9 (UBC9), whose low content indicates accelerated GLUT4 degradation was analyzed in soleus.Hypercorticosteronemia, hyperinsulinemia and low glucose decay rate in the insulin tolerance test of obese rats were restored by CBX (P < 0.05). Slc2a4/GLUT4 increased in SAT (P < 0.05) and decreased in VAT (P < 0.01) of obese rats. In soleus, obesity increased Slc2a4 but decreased GLUT4 (P < 0.01), possibly by accelerating GLUT4 degradation, as suggested by decreased UBC9 (P < 0.01). CBX restored both UBC9 and GLUT4 contents. SREBP1 did not participate in the Slc2a4 transcriptional regulation.The insulin sensitizer effect of CBX involves the increase of GLUT4 expression in soleus, indicating an increased glucose disposal in skeletal muscle. This observation reinforces the skeletal muscle as the main site of insulin-induced glucose uptake and sheds new light on the metabolic effects of 11βHSD1 inhibitors, since most of the studies so far have focused on its effects on liver and adipose tissues.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadipose tissue 3aanimal disease models 3aglucose 3aglucose transporters 3ahyperinsulinemia 3ainsulin 3ainsulin resistance 3ainsulin tolerance test 3aliver 3amessenger RNA 3amonosodium glutamate 3amuscles 3aobesity 3arats 3askeletal muscle 3asolutes 3asterols 3atranscription (genetics) 0aSlc2a4 0a11βHSD1 0aSREBP1 0aVisceral adipose tissue 0aSubcutaneous adipose tissue 0aSoleus1 aPoças da Silva, Thaís1 aCampello, Raquel Saldanha1 aMachado, Ubiratan Fabres0 tLife sciences.g2019 July 15, v. 229 p.157-165dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11720x0024-32057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2019.05.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01313naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002300112245007200135300001200207520058000219592002800799650001200827650001700839650001200856650001800868650001500886650001200901773012500913852000901038655001201047IND60302158520221118033819.0150704e20140110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6030215852DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPennisi, Elizabeth10aOnce Failing Biology Society Thrives as It Nurtures New Disciplines  ap. 129.  aThe Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology (SICB) is booming.

This paper attempts to provide an overview of the present state of crop modelling to assess climate change risks to food production and to which extent crop models comply with IAM demands. Considerable progress has been made in modelling effects of climate variables, where crop models best satisfy IAM demands. Demands are partly satisfied for simulating commonly required assessment variables. However, progress on the number of simulated crops, uncertainty propagation related to model parameters and structure, adaptations and scaling are less advanced and lagging behind IAM demands. The limitations are considered substantial and apply to a different extent to all crop models. Overcoming these limitations will require joint efforts, and consideration of novel modelling approaches.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3aclimatic factors 3acomputer software 3acrop models 3acrop production 3acrops 3aeconometric models 3aenvironmental models 3afood production 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3auncertainty 0aUncertainty 0aScaling 0aIntegrated assessment 0aRisk assessment 0aAdaptation 0aCrop models1 aRötter, R.P.1 aBindi, M.1 aWebber, H.1 aTrnka, M.1 aKersebaum, K.C.1 aOlesen, J.E.1 avan Ittersum, M.K.1 aJanssen, S.1 aRivington, M.1 aSemenov, M.A.1 aWallach, D.1 aPorter, J.R.1 aStewart, D.1 aVerhagen, J.1 aGaiser, T.1 aPalosuo, T.1 aTao, F.1 aNendel, C.1 aRoggero, P.P.1 aBartošová, L.1 aAsseng, S.0 tEnvironmental modelling & software.g2015 Oct., v. 72 p.287-303dElsevier Ltdx1364-81527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2014.12.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02158naa a2200265 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075024005100099040001800150100001900168245005900187300001600246500000900262500001500271520127900286592002801565650001101593650003701604653001101641773012101652852000901773856009801782655001201880991576352740742620221120051911.0191122e197011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7190108112DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci1970.0011183X001000060029x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBriggle, L.

Complete male sterility occurred at a relatively low frequency in the original stock. After the initial cross and four backcrosses to Chancellor, accompanied by rigid selection for single gene segregation for male sterility, some populations were obtained which segregated according to a ratio of three fertile plants to one malesterile plant. Intermediate types (partial sterility) did not occur in the most advanced and highly selected populations when grown in the greenhouse. Transmission of the recessive allele for male sterility by the male gamete occurred at the same frequency as by the Ieniale gamete. Number of gametes tested, however, was small. Female fertility was normal. Pollen produced by fertile plants was normal - whether those plants were homozygous for the dominant allele or heterozygous. Pollen produced by male-sterile plants was smaller than normal, irregular in shape, and did not stain in iodine solution. Fertile plants with the dominant allele (homozygous or heterozygous) did not restore fertility to Triticum titmpheevi-derived cytoplasmic male-sterility.  aPublisher supplied data 3abotany 3aPlant Science and Plant Products 0aplants0 tCrop science.g1970 Nov., v. 10, no. 6 p.693-696dCrop Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44570x0011-183X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2135/cropsci1970.0011183X001000060029x3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02646naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245010700162300001600269520139800285592002801683650001101711650001501722650001401737650001901751650001901770653004201789653003601831653003201867653003601899700001901935700001801954700001501972700001401987700001502001700001902016773012102035856008302156852000902239655001202248IND60762945220221123041454.0220517e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076294522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2022.01.0492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQu, Jiafu10aConstruction of BiVO4/NiCo2O4 nanosheet Z-scheme heterojunction for highly boost solar water oxidation  ap. 265-275.  aThe sluggish water oxidation process is a severe obstacle for solar-driven water splitting. Therefore, it is imperative to develop a suitable photocatalyst with reduced energy barrier for strong oxidation. In this study, a Z-scheme BiVO₄/NiCo₂O₄ (BVO/NCO) heterojunction system was designed by decorating ultrathin nickel–cobalt (NiCo₂O₄) spinel nanosheets on BiVO₄ as an efficient photocatalyst for water oxidation. The unique structure of the system significantly reduced the energy barrier and improved the oxidation ability of BiVO₄ to efficiently enhance the separation and transfer of the photogenerated carriers. Thus, the photocatalyst delivered an excellent O₂ evolution performance of 1640.9 μmol∙g⁻¹∙h⁻¹ and showed 124% improved efficiency as compared to pristine BiVO₄ and a quantum efficiency of 5.39% at 400 nm for O₂ evolution. Additionally, the theoretical calculations revealed that the formation of *OOH was the rate-determining step for water oxidation. The decoration with NiCo₂O₄ significantly reduced the energy barrier between *O and *OOH, which eventually improved the photocatalytic performance of BVO/NCO. The results hold great promise for the potential application of spinel-based materials in efficient photocatalytic O₂ evolution and offer fundamental insights into the design of efficient water oxidation heterojunctions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy 3ananosheets 3aoxidation 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 0aNiCo2O4/BiVO4 Z-scheme heterojunction 0aReduced reaction energy barrier 0aphotocatalytic O2 evolution 0aTailor heterojunction structure1 aYang, Xiaogang1 aGuo, Chunxian1 aCai, Yahui1 aLi, Zuoxi1 aHu, Jundie1 aMing Li, Chang0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2022 May, v. 613 p.265-275dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2022.01.0493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02366naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005900151245006600210520112100276592002801397650002001425650002301445650002201468650001801490650001101508650003201519650001001551653001301561653002001574653001701594653002501611653001901636653001401655653003001669700002201699700002201721773013001743856008601873852000901959655001201968IND60686707920221119004110.0200824e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068670792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envsoft.2020.1046682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTeimouri, Mahdi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5371-936410aForestFit: An R package for modeling plant size distributions  aModeling the diameter distribution of trees in forest stands is a frequent application in ecology that supports key biologically and economically relevant management decisions. The choice of model used to represent the diameter distribution and how to estimate its parameters has received much attention in the forestry literature; however, accessible software that facilitates comprehensive comparison of the myriad modeling approaches is not available. To this end, we developed an R package called ForestFit that simplifies estimation of common probability distributions used to model tree diameter distributions, including the two- and three-parameter Weibull distributions, Johnson’s SB distribution, Birnbaum–Saunders distribution, and finite mixture distributions. Frequentist and Bayesian techniques are provided for individual tree diameter data, as well as grouped data. Additional functionality facilitates fitting curves to height-diameter data. The package also provides a set of functions for computing probability distributions and simulating random realizations from common finite mixture models.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aWeibull statistics 3acomputer software 3aforest stands 3amodels 3atree and stand measurements 3atrees 0aBayesian 0aForest modeling 0aGrouped data 0aParameter estimation 0aMixture models 0aR package 0aStatistical distributions1 aDoser, Jeffrey W.1 aFinley, Andrew O.0 tEnvironmental modelling & software.g2020 Sept., v. 131 p.104668-dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:11634x1364-81527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2020.1046683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03168naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245015700169300001600326520158100342592002801923650001701951650002601968650001901994650003002013650001502043650001302058650001202071650001502083650001302098650001302111650001602124650000902140650001102149650001202160650001602172651001702188653003202205653001902237653001602256653002002272653001202292653001702304653001602321653002002337700001802357700001502375773015602390856008302546852000902629655001202638IND60541489320221120233533.0190318e201511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054148932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.sajb.2015.06.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMasubelele, M.L.10aBiome stability and long-term vegetation change in the semi-arid, south-eastern interior of South Africa: A synthesis of repeat photo-monitoring studies  ap. 139-147.  aWe synthesize recent literature concerned with the nature, extent and rate of vegetation change in the Albany thicket, Grassland and Nama-karoo biomes of the semi-arid, south-eastern interior of South Africa at a range of spatial and temporal scales in relation to local and global drivers. The change in cover of three main growth forms (grasses, dwarf shrubs [<1m] and tall shrubs [>1m]) at the community, ecotone and biome levels was analysed using field surveys and repeat photography spanning 27 to >100years. There has been an increase in grass and tall shrub cover and a decrease in dwarf shrub cover across the region over time. Vegetation composition and cover has been most stable in the Albany Thicket biome while Azonal habitats across the region have changed the most. The Grassland biome has experienced a significant increase in the cover of grasses and tall shrubs and a significant decline in cover of dwarf shrubs. Total cover and the cover of grasses have increased significantly in the Nama-karoo biome. We interpret these patterns as evidence for a south westwards shift in the Grassland/Nama-karoo biome boundary in the second half of the 20th century. Although there has been relatively little change in the boundaries between the Albany Thicket and adjacent biomes, several species with subtropical biogeographic affinities have increased in cover and abundance over this period in all biomes investigated. Drivers of the observed changes include rainfall amount and seasonality, temperature, land use and elevated CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiogeography 3abotanical composition 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon dioxide enrichment 3aecosystems 3aecotones 3agrasses 3agrasslands 3ahabitats 3aland use 3aphotography 3arain 3ashrubs 3asurveys 3atemperature 3aSouth Africa 0aBioclimatic envelope models 0aClimate change 0aDegradation 0aDesertification 0aEcotone 0aGrowth forms 0aOvergrazing 0aShrub expansion1 aHoffman, M.T.1 aBond, W.J.0 tSouth African journal of botany.g2015 Nov., v. 101 p.139-147dElsevier B.V.aSouth African Association of BotanistswJournal:jnl34108x0254-62997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sajb.2015.06.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02497naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245012500163300001600288520091500304592002801219650001501247650002101262650001001283650001801293650002101311650001701332650001901349650002201368650001801390650001001408650001601418650000901434650001301443650001601456650001301472650003101485650003201516653002101548653002001569653002201589700001201611700001301623700001601636700001201652700001201664700005201676700001601728773012001744856008201864852000901946655001201955IND60532997720221120221431.0160728e20140509xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053299772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2014.04.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQiu, Chuan10aHydrodynamic delivery of IL-28B (IFN-λ3) gene ameliorates lung inflammation induced by cigarette smoke exposure in mice  ap. 513-519.  aCigarette smoke (CS) is the principal cause of pulmonary inflammatory response. IL-28 (IFN-λ) is a novel group of class II cytokines targeting the epithelial cells and IL-28 responses prominent in lungs can exert important immunomodulatory effects. We tested the hypothesis that IL-28B may modulate the lung inflammation induced by CS. Groups of mice were exposed to CS two times per day for 11 consecutive days. CS exposure induced lymphocyte, neutrophil and macrophage infiltration and inflammatory cytokine (IL-1β, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF)-α, IL-17, and IL-4) in the airways. More importantly, all these CS-induced pathogenic changes were significantly inhibited by hydrodynamic delivery of plasmid DNA encoding mouse IL-28B. Thus, our results suggest that IL-28 cytokines are beneficial for the suppression of CS-mediated airway inflammation and may be a therapeutic target in CS-related diseases.  aPublisher supplied data 3acigarettes 3aepithelial cells 3agenes 3ahydrodynamics 3aimmunomodulation 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-17 3ainterleukin-1beta 3ainterleukin-4 3alungs 3amacrophages 3amice 3anecrosis 3aneutrophils 3aplasmids 3arespiratory tract diseases 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 0aIL-28B (IFN-λ3) 0aCigarette smoke 0aLung inflammation1 aLi, Yan1 aZhou, Mi1 aLiu, Jianfa1 aLi, Min1 aWu, Yan1 aXu, Damo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1192-92131 aLi, Mingcai0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2014 May 09, v. 447 p.513-519dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2014.04.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03059naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001500139245009200154300001600246500002000262520121700282592002801499596004801527596005101575596005901626596005901685596005901744596005901803596006201862596008101924650002502005650002702030650002102057650001302078650001302091650001102104650001902115650001302134650002802147650002402175700005702199700001802256700001402274700002002288700001602308700001902324773011602343856007302459852000902532655001202541IND60648225820221121032739.0190627e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064822582DNAL7 a10.1111/nph.156692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Song10aReactive oxygen species‐mediated BIN2 activity revealed by single‐molecule analysis  ap. 692-704.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aMuch evidence has shown that reactive oxygen species (ROS) regulate several plant hormone signaling cascades, but little is known about the real‐time kinetics and the underlying molecular mechanisms of the target proteins in the brassinosteroid (BR) signaling pathway. In this study, we used single‐molecule techniques to investigate the true signaling timescales of the major BR signaling components BRI1‐EMS‐SUPPRESSOR 1 (BES1) and BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE 2 (BIN2) of Arabidopsis thaliana. The rate constants of BIN2 associating with ATP and phosphorylating BES1 were determined to be 0.7 ± 0.4 mM⁻¹ s⁻¹ and 2.3 ± 1.4 s⁻¹, respectively. Interestingly, we found that the interaction of BIN2 and BES1 was oxygen‐dependent, and oxygen can directly modify BIN2. The activity of BIN2 was switched on via modification of specific cysteine (Cys) residues, including C59, C95, C99 and C162. The mutation of these Cys residues inhibited the BR signaling outputs.

Cl radicals play an important role in the nitrogen and O₃ cycles, sulfur chemistry and particle formation in the troposphere of the polluted coastal regions. This paper aimed at the heterogeneous reaction between gaseous HNO₃ and solid NaCl. The mechanism was investigated by density functional theory (DFT). The results imply that water molecules induce the surface reconstruction, which is essential for the heterogeneous reaction. The surface reconstruction on the defective (710) surface has a barrier of 10.24 kcal∙mol–¹ and is endothermic by 9.69 kcal∙mol–¹, whereas the reconstruction on the clean (100) surface has a barrier of 18.46 kcal$mol–1 and is endothermic by 12.96 kcal∙mol–¹. The surface reconstruction involved in water-adsorbed (710) surface is more energetically favorable. In comparison, water molecules adsorbed on NaCl (100) surface likely undergo water diffusion or desorption. Further, it reveals that the coordination number of the Cl ₒᵤₜ – is reduced after the surface reconstruction, which assists Cl ₒᵤₜ – to accept the proton from HNO₃. HCl is released from heterogeneous reactions between gaseous HNO₃ and solid NaCl and can react with OH free radicals to produce atomic Cl radicals. The results will offer further insights into the impact of gaseous HNO₃ on the air quality of the coastal areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair quality 3acoasts 3adesorption 3afree radicals 3ahydrochloric acid 3anitric acid 3anitrogen 3aozone 3asodium chloride 3asulfur 3atroposphere1 aZhang, Qingzhu1 aWang, Wenxing0 tFrontiers of environmental science & engineering.g2016 Oct., v. 10, no. 5 p.3-3dHigher Education Pressx2095-22017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11783-016-0836-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02537naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001700142245006100159520164900220592002801869650001601897650000901913650001001922650000901932650001201941650001801953651001001971700002201981700001602003773011802019856007702137852000902214655001202223IND60791004320221122232629.0220826e20220822xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079100432DNAL7 a10.3390/land110813722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTan, Weijia 10aPhysical Model Test on the Interface of Loess Fill Slope  aThe interface between the filling slope and the original slope is inevitable in the process of building a city in the loess area, which will affect the deformation and stability of the filling slope. In this paper, the loess fill slope of mountain excavation and city construction project in Yan’an City, China, is taken as the research object, and, based on field investigation and sampling, the effect of Loess Fill Slope Interface (LFSI) under rainfall is revealed by physical model test. The test samples were taken from a Loess Fill in Qilipu community, Yan’an, and three layers of sensors were arranged at the left and right interfaces of the original slope and the filled slope to monitor the water content, pore water pressure and deformation and failure characteristics during the experiment. The results show that ILFS is a rainfall dominant seepage channel, and the infiltration of rainfall along the interface lags behind. In addition, the variation laws of water content and pore water pressure at the interface between fill slope and original slope under rainfall are obtained. Finally, the failure process of loess fill slope under rainfall is summarized: local mud flow failure at the toe of the slope → erosion in the middle of the slope → crack initiation on the shoulder of the slope → local slip on the slope → crack propagation on the shoulder of the slope → shallow slip on the shoulder of the slope, and the instability mechanism of loess fill slope under rainfall is further revealed. The research results can provide theoretical and experimental reference for the protection of fill slopes in loess areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3adeformation 3aland 3aloess 3arain 3aseepage 3awater content 3aChina1 aHuang, Qiangbing 1 aChen, Xing 0 tLand.g2022 Aug. 22, v. 11, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21555x2073-445X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land110813723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03104naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245007500166300001400241520180400255592002802059650001102087650001802098650001502116650001002131650001202141650001502153650001302168650001502181650002102196650001402217650001602231650001302247650001902260650002402279650001602303653002202319653003002341653002002371700002102391773015402412856008302566852000902649655001202658IND60541489520221120233426.0190318e201511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054148952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.sajb.2015.06.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGray, Emma F.10aSoil nutrients in an African forest/savanna mosaic: Drivers or driven?  ap. 66-72.  aThis study set out to test three hypotheses explaining the existence of closed canopied versus open ecosystems in the same landscape and on the same parent rocks. Our data lent no support to the first hypothesis that forests are ancient and grasslands are anthropogenically derived through deforestation. Carbon isotope data suggests the opposite; both open and closed vegetation had C4 isotope signals in deeper soils, indicating that grasslands are the ancient system. The second hypothesis is that closed forests require nutrient rich soils and are replaced by open vegetation on nutrient poor soils. Despite open vegetation frequently havinglower nutrient concentrations than closed vegetation in our study area, nutrient stocks to 1m far exceeded threshold requirements to build a forest at all our sites. We suggest that vegetation patterns in our study area are a result of a third hypothesis, that forests and savannas are alternative stable states each subject to different ecological processes with positive feedbacks maintaining each state. Fire in open grassy vegetation is a key disturbance maintaining the boundaries between the two states. Frequent fires may deplete nutrients in the surface layers of the soil, thereby slowing tree growth and further maintaining the open state of the vegetation. However, our data on the vertical distribution of nutrients show strikingly similar nutrient patterns in the alternative biome states, with high nutrient concentrations in the open sites, suggesting that nutrient limitation is not an important feedback helping to maintain open ecosystems in our study area. Our results suggest that, rather than being drivers of vegetation patterns in our study area, soil nutrients are responding to dynamic vegetation changes caused by other factors.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3adeforestation 3aecosystems 3afires 3aforests 3agrasslands 3aisotopes 3alandscapes 3anutrient content 3anutrients 3aparent rock 3asavannas 3asoil nutrients 3asoil surface layers 3atree growth 0aLandscape mosaics 0aAlternative stable states 0aOpen ecosystems1 aBond, William J.0 tSouth African journal of botany.g2015 Nov., v. 101 p.66-72dElsevier B.V.aSouth African Association of BotanistswJournal:jnl34108x0254-62997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sajb.2015.06.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03206naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002500153245011200178520206800290592002802358650001602386650001802402650004302420651001202463653002002475653003302495653001102528653001802539653001902557700003102576700001502607700001702622773012002639856008802759852000902847655001202856IND60779737420221120044552.0221004e20220910xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077973742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1565202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFathololoumi, Solmaz10aSurface biophysical features fusion in remote sensing for improving land crop/cover classification accuracy  aPreparing up-to-date land crop/cover maps is important to study in order to achieve food security. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of surface biophysical features in the land crop/cover classification accuracy and introduce a new fusion-based method with more accurate results for land crop/cover classification. For this purpose, multi-temporal images from Sentinel 1 and 2, and an actual land crop map prepared by Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada (AAFC) in 2019 were used for 3 test sites in Ontario, Canada. Firstly, surface biophysical features maps were prepared based on spectral indices from Sentinel 2 including Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Index-based Built-up Index (IBI), Wetness, Albedo, and Brightness and co-polarization (VV) and cross-polarization (VH) from Sentinel 1 for different dates. Then, different scenarios were generated; these included single surface biophysical features as well as a combination of several surface biophysical features. Secondly, land crop/cover maps were prepared for each scenario based on the Random Forest (RF). In the third step, based on the voting strategy, classification maps from different scenarios were combined. Finally, the accuracy of the land crop/cover maps obtained from each of the scenario was evaluated. The results showed that the average overall accuracy of land crop/cover maps obtained from individual scenario (one feature) including NDVI, IBI, Wetness, Albedo, Brightness, VV and VH were 66%, 68%, 63%, 60%, 57%, 62% and 58%, respectively, which by the surface biophysical features fusion, the overall accuracy of land crop/cover maps increased to 83%. Also, by combining the classification results obtained from different scenarios based on voting strategy, the overall accuracy increased to 89%. The results of this study indicate that the feature level-based fusion of surface biophysical features and decision level based fusion of land crop/cover maps obtained from various scenarios increases the accuracy of land crop/cover classification.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenvironment 3afood security 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3aOntario 0aLand crop/cover 0aSurface biophysical features 0aFusion 0aRandom forest 0aRemote sensing1 aFirozjaei, Mohammad Karimi1 aLi, Huijie1 aBiswas, Asim0 tScience of the total environment.g2022 Sept. 10, v. 838 p.156520-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1565203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02954naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001200148245015000160300001600310500001900326520159400345592002801939596007001967650001502037650001602052650004402068650001902112650001402131650001302145650001402158650001302172650001102185650001202196650002102208650001602229700001502245700001302260700001502273700001702288773012402305856008202429852000902511655001202520IND60718781520221121053131.0201126e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071878152DNAL7 a10.1007/s12230-020-09803-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Wei10aEffects of Red and Blue Light with Supplemental White Light on Growth, Carbohydrate Metabolism, and Yield of Virus-Free Potato in Plant Factories  ap. 554-564.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe light spectrum has a strong effect on potato tuber development. To investigate the effect of varying the spectrum on potato tuber growth and yield, potato plantlets were transplanted under red/white light (RW; red light: 200 μmol m⁻² s⁻¹; white light: 100 μmol m⁻² s⁻¹), blue/white light (BW; blue light: 200 μmol m⁻² s⁻¹; white light: 100 μmol m⁻² s⁻¹), and white/red/blue light (WRB; white light: 100 μmol m⁻² s⁻¹; red light: 100 μmol m⁻² s⁻¹; blue light: 100 μmol m⁻² s⁻¹) with a 11/13-h (light/dark) photoperiod. Potato plants grown under RW had the highest mean fresh tuber weight and total yield among all treatments. Plants under RW resulted in the highest shoot dry weight at 30 d and 45 d among all treatments, providing a photosynthetic source for the tubers. Furthermore, the photosynthetic leaves under RW had a significantly higher total chlorophyll content than other treatments at 90 d. Plants under RW significantly increased tuber fresh weight per plant by 57.7% from 60 to 90 d. The spectrum of BW benefited potato bulking. Plants under BW at 40 d resulted in significant sucrose and starch changes between day and night compared with those at 20 d. BW had a positive effect on the activities of ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase at 40 d and sucrose synthase at 60 d compared with RW and WRB during the day. Thus, the ratio of tuber (fresh weight of tuber ≥2.0 g) under BW was significantly higher than that under RW and WRB. The total yield of tubers under WRB was the lowest among all treatments.  aPublisher supplied data  a2017YFB0403903cKey Technologies Research and Development Program 3ablue light 3achlorophyll 3aglucose-1-phosphate adenylyltransferase 3aphotosynthesis 3aplantlets 3apotatoes 3ared light 3aresearch 3astarch 3asucrose 3asucrose synthase 3awhite light1 aMiao, Chen1 aYou, Jie1 aGan, Lijun1 aXu, Zhi-Gang0 tAmerican journal of potato research.g2020 Dec., v. 97, no. 6 p.554-564dSpringer USwJournal:jnl56713x1099-209X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12230-020-09803-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02403naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002600153245006300179300001600242520098400258592002801242650000901270650001001279650001401289650001401303650002101317650001201338650002301350650001701373650002001390650001501410651001101425653001801436653001401454653001701468653002201485653002401507653002501531700002001556700002301576700002301599700002301622700002801645700002401673773011501697856008801812852000901900655001201909IND60540175320221122103501.0190318e20150228xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054017532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.marpolbul.2014.09.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPossatto, Fernanda E.10aMarine debris in a World Heritage Listed Brazilian estuary  ap. 548-553.  aUsing monthly otter-trawl deployments, spatial and temporal variability among the relative densities of marine debris were assessed in the Paranaguá estuarine complex; a subtropical World Heritage Listed area in southern Brazil. During 432 deployments over 12months, 291 marine debris items were identified; of which most (92%) were plastic, and more specifically shopping bags, food packages, candy wrappers and cups typically >21mm long. The most contaminated sectors were those closest to Paranaguá city and the adjacent port, and had up to 23.37±3.22 pieces ha−1. Less urbanized sectors had between 12.84±1.49 and 9.32±1.10 pieces ha−1. Contamination did not vary between dry or wet seasons, but rather was probably affected by consistent urban disposal and localized hydrological processes.

The residue yield was between 0.7 and 9 green tonne per hectare, at a moisture content from 37% to 48%. Yield was highest for the orchards, and lowest for vineyards. Harvesters collected the residues and moved them to the roadside at a cost of between 11 and 60€ per green tonne, depending on field conditions and technology choice. Single-pass harvesting was the cheapest, especially if applied through a dedicated tractor and a towed unit with a large integral container. Two-pass harvesting was the most flexible, but also the most expensive: it should be favored only when space, weather or other management constraints limit the application of the other systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapples 3acontainers 3aenergy conversion 3afield experimentation 3aharvesters 3aharvesting 3aorchards 3apears 3apruning 3avineyards 3awater content 2aAgriculturexmethods 2aBiotechnologyxmethods 2aForestryxmethods 2aFruit 2aIndustrial Wastexprevention & control 2aRefuse Disposalxmethods 2aTechnology Assessment, Biomedical 2aWood 0aEnergy 0aVineyards 0aHarvesting 0aBiomass1 aPari, Luigi1 aPicchi, Gianni1 aSpinelli, Raffaele0 tBioresource technology.g2013 Jan., v. 128 p.697-702dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2012.10.1493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02429naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245013500167300001200302520097900314592002801293650004401321650002101365650002301386650001901409650001301428650001201441650002301453650001101476650001901487650003301506650000901539650002201548650002101570653001801591653001901609653005001628653002001678653001001698653001601708700001701724700001801741773010801759856008301867852000901950655001201959IND60547022120221119074331.0161023e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054702212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ibiod.2013.09.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMasood, Farha10aComparative oxo-biodegradation study of poly-3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate/polypropylene blend in controlled environments  ap. 1-8.  aThe potential use of poly-3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate (PHBV) copolymer as a biodegradable additive in polypropylene (PP) has been explored. The melt blending technique was used to produce the blend of PHBV/PP (PB10). The degradation studies of PB10 were done in the field as well as in controlled laboratory conditions. The structural changes were studied using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). SEM micrographs showed the formation of agglomerates, pits, grooves, and holes on the treated films as a result of microbial activity. FTIR spectra indicated clear evidences of oxo-biodegradation of polymer chains due to an increase in carbonyl peak index. Thermogravimetric analysis confirmed that the thermal stability of PB10 was increased after soil burial. This study contributed toward the prospective commercial applications of PHBV for use in the food packaging industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3abiodegradability 3acomposite polymers 3afood packaging 3aindustry 3amelting 3amicrobial activity 3amixing 3apolypropylenes 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asoil 3athermal stability 3athermogravimetry 0aPolypropylene 0aBiodegradation 0aPoly-(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) 0aBacillus cereus 0aBlend 0aPolyolefins1 aYasin, Tariq1 aHameed, Abdul0 tInternational Biodeterioration & Biodegradation.g2014 Feb., v. 87 p.1-8dElsevier Ltdx0964-83057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ibiod.2013.09.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03498naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245014300167300001600310500001500326520162600341592002801967650002201995650002502017650001202042650001502054650002202069650001602091650001602107650001802123650001302141650000902154650001702163650001502180650002102195650001102216650002002227650002502247650001702272650002502289650002702314650001902341650001802360650003502378650000702413650001902420653002102439653001402460653002102474653003402495653001702529653001302546653002002559653001602579700001502595700002302610700001702633700001102650773008202661856008402743852000902827655001202836IND60545149420221120102140.0160901e20140301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054514942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.watres.2013.12.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMei, Xiu-Qin10aRoles of root porosity, radial oxygen loss, Fe plaque formation on nutrient removal and tolerance of wetland plants to domestic wastewater  ap. 147-159.  a2019-12-06  aRoot properties including rates of radial oxygen loss (ROL), root porosity, and Fe plaque formation on the root surface, in six wetland plant species, namely Acorus calamus, Arundo donax var. versicolor, Cyperus flabelliformis, Canna indica, Iris tectorum, and Scirpus validus, and their relationships with nutrient removal and tolerance to domestic wastewater were investigated. Results showed that different species had different root porosities (18–36%) and Fe plaque formation (1.76–5.3 mg Fe g−1 root d.w.), which were significantly correlated with ROL (67–157 mmol O2 kg−1 root d.w. d−1) (p < 0.001). The ROL rates were also positively correlated with plant tolerance to domestic wastewater (p < 0.001) and removal of total nitrogen (35–76%), total phosphate (22–62%), and chemical oxygen demand (58–86%). Among the six species, C. flabelliformis and C. indica had significantly higher ROL, greater Fe plaque formation, higher tolerance to domestic wastewater, and better removal of TN, TP, and COD. These two species also had greater influences on changes in redox potential, pH, dissolved oxygen, and the quotients of [NH4+–N]:[NO3−–N] in rhizosphere soil solution, as well as greater N and P uptake in plant tissues, particularly belowground parts, than in the other species. For all plant species investigated, wastewater significantly decreased the rates of ROL and root porosity but induced greater Fe plaque formation. These results suggested that root properties are useful for selecting tolerant and efficient species in constructed wetland wastewater treatment facilities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aunderground parts 3awastewater treatment 3aCyperus 3aphosphorus 3aammonium nitrogen 3acorrelation 3arhizosphere 3asoil solution 3aporosity 3airon 3aCanna indica 3aphosphates 3adissolved oxygen 3aoxygen 3aredox potential 3amunicipal wastewater 3aArundo donax 3aconstructed wetlands 3achemical oxygen demand 3aAcorus calamus 3aplant tissues 3aSchoenoplectus tabernaemontani 3apH 3awetland plants 0aN/P accumulation 0aFe plaque 0aNutrient removal 0aDomestic wastewater tolerance 0aRates of ROL 0aPorosity 0aScirpus validus 0aRhizosphere1 aYang, Yang1 aTam, Nora Fung-Yee1 aWang, Yawen,1 aLi, Li0 tWater research.g2014 Mar. 01, v. 50 p.147-159dElsevier Ltdx0043-13547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2013.12.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02587naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245016600167300001800333500001900351520125900370592002801629650001101657650001201668650001901680650001101699650002001710650001001730650001601740650001601756650001701772650001401789650001501803650001201818650001501830651001201845700001801857700005901875773014001934856008202074852000902156655001202165IND60716558420221120040235.0201105e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071655842DNAL7 a10.1007/s10653-020-00626-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBui, Anh T.

The relocation of rice production to upland regions could be an option for increasing the sustainability of rice production. Our study evaluated the spatial patterning of heavy metals, i.e., copper (Cu) and cadmium (Cd), in rice along a topogradient from terrace to lowland areas in the Red River basin. The dataset obtained from the analysis of 61 farm sites throughout the whole basin indicated a large discrepancy in the Cu and Cd contents in rice grains from terrace and lowland paddies. While Cu and Cd were not found in most of the rice grain samples from the terrace paddies, the median Cu and Cd contents of the lowland paddy rice were 1.895 and 0.033 mg kg⁻¹, respectively. Assessing the relationship of Cu and Cd in the soil–rice system to soil properties revealed possible correlations between soil available silicon (Si) and the Cu and Cd contents in rice grain. The enrichment of Si in rice plants likely reduces the translocation of Cu and Cd from soil to grain. Therefore, management of the Si supply, particularly in lowland paddies, should be highlighted as a way to reduce dietary intake of Cu and Cd.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3acadmium 3aclimate change 3acopper 3adata collection 3afarms 3afloodplains 3afood intake 3ageochemistry 3ahighlands 3arough rice 3asilicon 3awatersheds 3aVietnam1 aDuong, Lim T.1 aNguyen, Minh N.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7866-56090 tEnvironmental geochemistry and health.g2020 Nov., v. 42, no. 11 p.3753-3764dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3870049x0269-40427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10653-020-00626-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04102naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004400111040001800155100001500173245008900188300001600277500002400293520220000317650003402517650003002551650001802581650001302599650001402612650001202626650001202638650002202650650001402672650001802686650002602704650001302730650001102743650002702754650001802781650000902799650003002808650001102838650002402849650006002873650002702933650001102960650003202971650002003003650000903023650002603032650001703058650003903075700002503114700002103139700002003160700002903180700002703209700002303236773010203259852000903361856009403370655001203464IND4379283820221118002355.0060402s2006    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437928382DNAL7 a165678172pmid7 a10.2337/diacare.29.04.06.dc05-18182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatz, Karl10aDisorders of Glucose Metabolism in Acute Stroke Patients: An underrecognized problem  ap. 792-797.  aIncludes references  aOBJECTIVE:--To determine the prevalence of disturbances in glucose metabolism in patients with acute stroke. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS--Consecutively admitted acute stroke patients (n = 286) were screened for glucose tolerance according to the standardized World Health Organization protocol in the 1st and 2nd week after the stroke event. In addition, we repeatedly measured fasting capillary blood glucose during the first 10 days. RESULTS:--Measurements were not performed or cancelled if patients were not fully conscious or had severe dysphagia or early complications that made transfers to other hospitals necessary (n = 48). Of the remaining 238 patients, 20.2% had previously known diabetes; 16.4% were classified as having newly diagnosed diabetes, 23.1% as having impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), and 0.8% as having impaired fasting glucose; and only 19.7% showed normal glucose levels. Another 47 patients (19.7%) had hyperglycemic values only in the 1st week (transient hyperglycemia) or could not be fully classified due to missing data in the oral glucose tolerance test. Patients with diabetes compared with nondiabetic subjects had more severe strokes (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale [NIHSS] on admission: 7.2 ± 6.6 vs. 4.6 ± 3.1, 4.2 ± 4.4, and 3.7 ± 3.6 for IGT, transient hyperglycemia, and normoglycemia, respectively; P < 0.001), a worse outcome (modified Rankin scale 0-1 at discharge: 40.2 vs. 54.4, 63.8, and 72.3% for IGT, transient hyperglycemia, and normoglycemia, respectively; P < 0.001), and a higher rate of infectious complications (35.6 vs. 12.3, 21.2, and 4.2% for IGT, transient hyperglycemia, and normoglycemia, respectively; P < 0.001). In the multivariate analysis, NIHSS on admission, female sex, and the occurrence of urinary tract infection were independently associated with newly diagnosed diabetes. CONCLUSIONS:--The majority of acute stroke patients have disorders of glucose metabolism, and in most cases this fact has been unrecognized. Diabetes worsens the outcome of acute stroke. Therefore, in the post-acute phase, an oral glucose tolerance test should be recommended in all stroke patients with no prior history of diabetes. 3aNational Institutes of Health 3aWorld Health Organization 3ablood glucose 3adiabetes 3adysphagia 3afasting 3aglucose 3aglucose tolerance 3ahospitals 3ahyperglycemia 3amultivariate analysis 3apatients 3astroke 3aurinary tract diseases 2aAcute Disease 2aAged 2aBlood Glucosexmetabolism 2aFemale 2aGlucosexmetabolism 2aGlucose Metabolism Disordersxcomplicationsxdiagnosis. 2aGlucose Tolerance Test 2aHumans 2aHypertensionxcomplications 2aLogistic Models 2aMale 2aMultivariate Analysis 2aRisk Factors 2aStrokexcomplicationsxmetabolism.1 aKeresztes, Katharina1 aTatschl, Claudia1 aNowotny, Monika1 aDachenhausenm, Alexandra1 aBrainin, M.q(Michael)1 aTuomilehto, Jaakko0 tDiabetes care.g2006 Apr., v. 29, no. 4 p.792-797dAmerican Diabetes Associationx0149-59927nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2337/diacare.29.04.06.dc05-18183Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01902naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001800141245004500159300001600204520094900220650002901169650001301198650001501211650001601226650001101242650001201253650002401265650002101289700001801310700001801328700001801346773014901364856004201513852000901555655001201564IND60589043120221118002357.0180131e199003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058904312DNAL7 a10.13031/2013.263712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWalker, P.

The grain storage system was divided into several cost components including land rent, site preparation, bins, fans, elevator, and energy. Algorithms were developed to predict the annual cost of each component as a function of size and number of bins. Scaling factors were included, allowing users to accommodate local conditions. These cost components were then combined to determine the total annual cost. An exhaustive search was employed to identify the bin diameter and number of bins which gave the lowest cost value. That combination was considered the optimum.

The quality characteristics that were evaluated were kernel breakage from milling, color, deformity, and the percentage of completely gelatinized (translucent) grains. The translucent grains percentage increased with an increase in both soak temperature and period of equilibration after soaking. The deformity of parboiled rice decreased with an increase in the equilibration period. The results for the color and breakage did not show a consistent trend. 3aagricultural engineering 3acolor 3amilling 3aparboiling 3arice 3aseeds 3asoaking 3awater temperature1 aVelupillai, L.1 aVerma, L.

It examines the effect of food hygiene training on hygiene practices and investigates the correlations between the hygienic status of food handlers' hands and that of kitchen utensils. Furthermore, it determines the influences of demographic and facility-related factors on hygiene practices in small day care centers. A total of 56 food handlers at 49 day care centers in the Gyeongnam area of South Korea participated in hygiene training. The results of the study showed that after two training sessions, the ATP bioluminescence levels of knives (P < 0.01), cutting boards (P < 0.01), food handlers' hands (P < 0.001), and UV disinfection cabinets (P < 0.01) decreased. After training, the total scores on the inspection checklist were significantly improved (P < 0.05). Strong associations between the microbial quality of hands and kitchen utensils were seen. Classification and regression tree analysis identified important factors that influence hygiene practices at small food service kitchens, such as status of registration with the government certification authority, length of food handlers' working experience and their age, and maximum number of people served. This study helps to broaden our knowledge of food hygiene issues in small day care centers. 3aadenosine triphosphate 3abioluminescence 3acertification 3acutting boards 3aday care centers 3adisinfection 3afood handling 3afood sanitation 3afood service 3ahands 3ahygiene 3akitchens 3aknives 3amicrobiological quality 3aregression analysis 3aSouth Korea0 tJournal of food protection.g2018 Jan., v. 81, no. 1 p.158-164dInternational Association of Milk, Food, and Environmental Sanitarians.wJournal:2024x0362-028X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-17-163  aDNAL 7aarticle02276naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001500141245007800156300001600234520111300250650002901363650001501392650003001407650000901437650001101446650001201457650001801469650002601487650002301513650002601536650001501562650001301577650001601590651001301606700001701619700001601636700001501652773014801667856004201815852000901857655001201866IND60589044820221118002425.0180131e199005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058904482DNAL7 a10.13031/2013.263842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCahoon, J.12aA Microcomputer-Based Irrigation Scheduler for the Humid Mid-South Region  ap. 289-295.  aThis article presents the development and field validation of the University of Arkansas Irrigation Scheduler, a microcomputer based program designed to assist in scheduling irrigations in the humid Mid-South. The program has separate subroutines for stationary and towable center pivot systems, and surface (furrow and flood) irrigation systems. The program is designed to schedule irrigations for a system, thus, the water source is the focal point not each individual field served by the water source. Algorithms are incorporated into the center pivot programs to optimize scheduling based on soil moisture considerations as well as tactical goals concerning pivot placement. The program supports irrigation scheduling for soybeans, cotton, corn, and grain sorghum. The user input necessary is daily maximum temperature, daily precipitation and irrigation dates and, for pivot systems, irrigation application depths. The results of several years of field use, in both qualitative and quantitative analyses, indicate that the program is a valuable irrigation scheduling tool for use in the humid Mid-South. 3aagricultural engineering 3aalgorithms 3aatmospheric precipitation 3acorn 3acotton 3afurrows 3agrain sorghum 3airrigation scheduling 3airrigation systems 3aquantitative analysis 3asoil water 3asoybeans 3atemperature 3aArkansas1 aFerguson, J.1 aEdwards, D.1 aTacker, P.0 tApplied engineering in agriculture.g1990 May, v. 6, no. 3 p.289-295dAmerican Society of Agricultural EngineerswJournal:2058x0883-85427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.13031/2013.26384  aDNAL 7aarticle01404naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002000141245006500161300001600226520056100242650002900803650001900832650001600851650002000867650002400887650001600911773014800927856004201075852000901117655001201126IND60589044320221118002247.0180131e199005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058904432DNAL7 a10.13031/2013.263802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnthony, W.

The results showed that a 10° C difference between average ambient air temperature and initial wheat temperature justified a cooling cycle. High airflow rates cooled the wheat by an average of 6° C with about 9 hours of fan operation. There were no adverse effects on test weight or moisture content. Data from literature were used to show such a reduction in grain temperature could reduce insect population growth by 80 to 97%. Airflow rates greater than 0.02 m3/s/m3 (1.5 cfm/bu) would allow Kansas producers to utilize the limited hours in July and August when ambient air temperatures are below 20° C (68° F) or 10° C (18° F) below harvest temperatures. 3aadverse effects 3aagricultural engineering 3aair flow 3aambient temperature 3ainsects 3apopulation growth 3awater content 3aweather 3awheat 3aKansas1 aHagstrum, D.

A broad range of cytokine mRNAs were detected in 16 early nodules and 28 late-stage ulcers, including those for the Th1 cytokines tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-[alpha]) and gamma interferon (IFN-[gamma]) and the Th2 cytokine interleukin 10 (IL-10). IFN-[gamma] was strongly expressed in both nodules and ulcers, suggesting that a Th1 response begins early in the disease. There was a significantly higher expression of IL-8 and other proinflammatory cytokines in results from 32 biopsies with neutrophilia than in those from 12 biopsies without acute inflammation. Ten tissue samples containing granulomas showed high mRNA expression for IFN-[gamma], IL-1{szligbeta}, IL-12p35, IL-12p40, IL-15, and TNF-[alpha] relative to 34 tissue samples without granulomas. These results suggest that the human immune response to M. ulcerans is similar to that seen with some other mycobacteria despite the presence of the toxin mycolactone in the tissues. 3aMycobacterium 3agene expression 3ahumans 3aimmune response 3ainflammation 3ainterferon-gamma 3ainterleukin-1 3ainterleukin-10 3ainterleukin-8 3amessenger RNA 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha1 aHorsfield, C.1 aMangan, J.1 aLaing, K.1 aEtuaful, S.1 aAwuah, P.1 aNyarko, K.1 aOsei-Sarpong, F.1 aButcher, P.1 aLucas, S.1 aWansbrough-Jones, M.0 tInfection and immunity.g2006 May, v. 74, no. 5 p.2917-2924dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx1098-55227nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03780naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111040001800133100001800151245014000169300001800309500002400327520168200351650002802033650002402061650001602085650002002101650003402121650002002155650002102175650002802196650001202224650002402236650002102260650001302281650004902294650001202343650003102355650003902386650003102425650005902456650004402515650004302559650004702602650003302649650005002682650001202732650003102744650003602775650002802811650003602839650005402875700001902929700002202948700001902970700002302989700001703012773011603029852000903145655001203154IND4379873820221118002728.0060425s2006    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437987382DNAL7 a166222262pmid7 aPMC14597082pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOda, Masataka10aSignal Transduction Mechanism Involved in Clostridium perfringens Alpha-Toxin-Induced Superoxide Anion Generation in Rabbit Neutrophils  ap. 2876-2886.  aIncludes references  aClostridium perfringens alpha-toxin induces the generation of superoxide anion (O₂⁻) via production of 1,2-diacylglycerol (DG) in rabbit neutrophils. The mechanism of the generation, however, remains poorly understood. Here we report a novel mechanism for the toxin-induced production of O₂⁻ in rabbit neutrophils. Treatment of the cells with the toxin resulted in tyrosine phosphorylation of a protein of about 140 kDa. The protein reacted with anti-TrkA (nerve growth factor high-affinity receptor) antibody and bound nerve growth factor. Anti-TrkA antibody inhibited the production of O₂⁻ and binding of the toxin to the protein. The toxin induced phosphorylation of 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1). K252a, an inhibitor of TrkA receptor, and LY294002, an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), reduced the toxin-induced production of O₂⁻ and phosphorylation of PDK1, but not the formation of DG. These inhibitors inhibited the toxin-induced phosphorylation of protein kinase C [theta] (PKC[theta]). U73122, a phospholipase C (PLC) inhibitor, and pertussis toxin inhibited the toxin-induced generation of O₂⁻ and formation of DG, but not the phosphorylation of PDK1. These observations show that the toxin independently induces production of DG through activation of endogenous PLC and phosphorylation of PDK1 via the TrkA receptor signaling pathway and that these events synergistically activate PKC[theta] in stimulating an increase in O₂⁻. In addition, we show the participation of mitogen-activated protein kinase-associated signaling events via activation of PKC[theta] in the toxin-induced generation of O₂⁻. 3aClostridium perfringens 3anerve growth factor 3aneutrophils 3apertussis toxin 3aphosphatidylinositol 3-kinase 3aphospholipase C 3aprotein kinase C 3aprotein phosphorylation 3arabbits 3asignal transduction 3asuperoxide anion 3atyrosine 2a3-Phosphoinositide-Dependent Protein Kinases 2aAnimals 2aBacterial Toxinsxtoxicity 2aCalcium-Binding Proteinsxtoxicity 2aDiglyceridesxpharmacology 2aExtracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinasesxphysiology 2aMAP Kinase Signaling Systemxphysiology 2aNeutrophilsxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aPhosphatidylinositol 3-Kinasesxphysiology 2aProtein Kinase Cxphysiology 2aProtein Serine-Threonine Kinasesxphysiology. 2aRabbits 2aReceptor, trkAxmetabolism 2aSignal Transductionxphysiology 2aSuperoxidesxmetabolism 2aType C Phospholipasesxtoxicity 2ap38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinasesxphysiology1 aIkari, Syusuke1 aMatsuno, Takayuki1 aMorimune, Yuka1 aNagahama, Masahiro1 aSakurai, Jun0 tInfection and immunity.g2006 May, v. 74, no. 5 p.2876-2886dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx1098-55227nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02880naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134072000900152072000900161072000900170100001900179245012700198300001600325500002400341500001500365520130200380650002201682650001801704650001901722650002301741650001101764650002801775650002701803650001901830650000901849650002401858650001601882650001601898650002001914650002101934650001701955650001801972653001901990653001202009700001802021700002202039773010502061852000902166856009202175930003302267945002502300946001302325655001202338IND4435443420221118002702.0100416e201005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443544342DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1745-4565.2010.00223.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ201 0aQ204 0aQ2051 aTournas, V.

Results indicated that PYM performed very well for all tested commodities giving YM counts similar to those of the FDA method. Statistical analysis of the data (t-test) revealed no significant differences between the two methods for all foods tested. Linear regression analysis showed that the correlation coefficients between the two methods were over 0.90 for 91% of the commodities tested. Some difficulties were encountered during counting of the colonies on PYM as yeast colonies on this medium tend to be very small with rather faded colorations. Assessment of the efficacy of Petrifilm and determining its equivalence to traditional, validated methods will give the testing laboratories and the industry an alternate option for the enumeration of fungi in foods. The use of Petrifilm would be especially useful when analyst time is limited as it requires no media preparation and minimal time for sample inoculation. 3afilms (materials) 3alinear models 3adairy products 3afood contamination 3ayeasts 3amicrobial contamination 3amicrobial colonization 3afood pathogens 3anuts 3amicrobial detection 3afood grains 3adried fruit 3afresh-cut foods 3amicrobial growth 3afruit juices 3amolds (fungi) 0agrain products 0aproduce1 aFeliciano, L.1 aKatsoundas, E.

We conducted a prospective study of the individual and combined effects of commonly available clinical information in the prediction of diabetic foot ulcer occurrence. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS--We followed 1,285 diabetic veterans without foot ulcer for this outcome with annual clinical evaluations and quarterly mailed questionnaires to identify foot problems. At baseline we assessed age; race; weight; current smoking; diabetes duration and treatment; HbA₁c (A1C); visual acuity; history of laser photocoagulation treatment, foot ulcer, and amputation; foot shape; claudication; foot insensitivity to the 10-g monofilament; foot callus; pedal edema; hallux limitus; tinea pedis; and onychomycosis. Cox proportional hazards modeling was used with backwards stepwise elimination to develop a prediction model for the first foot ulcer occurrence after the baseline examination. RESULTS:--At baseline, subjects were 62.4 years of age on average and 98% male. Mean follow-up duration was 3.38 years, during which time 216 foot ulcers occurred, for an incidence of 5.0/100 person-years. Significant predictors (P <= 0.05) of foot ulcer in the final model (hazard ratio, 95% CI) included A1C (1.10, 1.06-1.15), impaired vision (1.48, 1.00-2.18), prior foot ulcer (2.18, 1.61-2.95), prior amputation (2.57, 1.60-4.12), monofilament insensitivity (2.03, 1.50-2.76), tinea pedis (0.73, 0.54-0.98), and onychomycosis (1.58, 1.16-2.16). Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.81 at 1 year and 0.76 at 5 years. CONCLUSIONS:--Readily available clinical information has substantial predictive power for the development of diabetic foot ulcer and may help in accurately targeting persons at high risk of this outcome for preventive interventions. 3aamputation 3acallus 3adiabetes 3aedema 3amodels 3aprediction 3aprospective studies 3aquestionnaires 3arisk 3aveterans 3avision disorders 2aAged 2aAmputation, Surgicalxstatistics & numerical data. 2aDiabetes Mellitus, Type 1xepidemiology 2aDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2xepidemiology 2aDiabetic Footxepidemiology 2aFemale 2aFollow-Up Studies 2aGlycated Hemoglobinxanalysis. 2aHospitals, Veterans 2aHumans 2aIntermittent Claudicationxepidemiology 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aPredictive Value of Tests 0aWashington1 aAhroni, Jessie H.1 aCohen, Victoria1 aNelson, Karin M.1 aHeagerty, Patrick.0 tDiabetes care.g2006 June, v. 29, no. 6 p.1202-1207dAmerican Diabetes Associationx0149-59927nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2337/dc05-20313Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02962naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134072000900152072000900161100001900170245007600189300001600265500002400281500001500305520168600320650002502006650002602031650002202057650002302079650002302102650002002125650001302145650001202158651002102170653001602191700002002207700002402227773010502251852000902356856009202365930003302457945002502490946001302515655001202528IND4435442720221117235926.0100416e201005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443544272DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1745-4565.2010.00216.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ200 0aT1201 aSanlier, Nevin10aHygiene perception: condition of hotel kitchen staffs in Ankara, Turkey  ap. 415-431.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe study, which analyzed knowledge levels of the staff who work in food and beverage departments of hotels in Turkey about food safety, was carried out in December 2007-March 2008. Researchers applied face to face survey to 522 employees of seven hotels. The difference has been found meaningful statistically between kitchen and kitchenware hygiene, employee hygiene, food hygiene and general hygiene knowledge points and their education status and occupations in the result of the study (P < 0.05). On the other hand, a meaningful relationship has not been found statistically between food safety knowledge levels of the staff and their age ranges (P > 0.05). First, it is required to pay attention to the determining of the training needs of employees working for the enterprise, and to make a point of applying necessary training and seminars concerning the staff in each degree by making a training program. It has been determined that training, occupation and experience of the staff are so important in order to provide food safety in enterprises. Each year, millions of people worldwide suffer from foodborne diseases and illnesses. Therefore, food-related infection is an important health problem in many countries. This study analyzed the knowledge levels of employees who work in the food and beverage departments. It has been found that there is a need to develop a state policy regarding education to be given to consumers and employees about food safety knowledge and practices. Education should be repeated with specific intervals to ensure that learnt information is turned into attitudes and behaviors; and procedures and processes should be controlled regularly. 3afood service workers 3afood safety education 3akitchen equipment 3ahotel food service 3aeducational status 3afood sanitation 3akitchens 3ahygiene 3aTurkey (country) 0afood safety1 aComert, Menekse1 aDurlu-Ozkaya, Fugen0 tJournal of food safety.g2010 May, v. 30, no. 2 p.415-431dBlackwell Publishing Incx0149-60857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-4565.2010.00216.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20110824b20110902c00000000  aINDdPNNe2010/05/18  aOther US 7aarticle02208naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002200152245008200174300001600256500002400272520111600296650004001412650002901452650001001481650002601491650001301517650001301530650002101543650002201564650001401586650003001600650001101630700001901641773010101660852000901761856007601770655001201846IND4379913120151214000000.0060425s2006    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437991312DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1567-1364.2006.00033.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFairhead, Cécile10aStructure of Kluyveromyces lactis subtelomeres: duplications and gene content  ap. 428-441.  aIncludes references  aWe have constructed a map of the duplicated regions of Kluyveromyces lactis subtelomeres. Seven out of 12 subtelomeres contain an almost identical 9 kb long segment starting from the end. This segment is bordered by a long terminal repeat element. Two of the subtelomeres share sequence similarity that extends over a total of 20 kb. The other subtelomeres also contain duplicated regions of 1-6 kb. Nonduplicated regions contain unique genes and genes from paralog families. All duplicated segments are in the same orientation with respect to the telomere, probably as a result of genetic exchange. We map the only two copies of retrotransposons in the genome, in subtelomeres. Low-complexity gene sequences that encode threonine- and serine-rich peptides are associated with the subtelomeres of K. lactis, as in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The ubiquity of these sequences in hemiascomycete genomes, and the propensity they have to encode proteins with extracellular localization, make these genes ideal candidates for fast evolving 'contingency' genes involved in the adaptation of a species to its environment. 3aKluyveromyces marxianus var. lactis 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3agenes 3agenetic recombination 3apeptides 3aproteins 3aretrotransposons 3asequence homology 3atelomeres 3aterminal repeat sequences 3ayeasts1 aDujon, Bernard0 tFEMS yeast research.g2006 May, v. 6, no. 3 p.428-441dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1567-13567nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1567-1364.2006.00033.x3electronic resource 7aarticle02629naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002900111040001800140100001700158245006400175300001800239500002400257520110300281650000801384650001101392650002101403650001601424650002401440650001101464650001301475650001401488650001201502650001201514650001801526650001201544650002201556650002001578650002601598650001101624650003201635650000901667650002701676650003201703650002001735650001201755700001701767700001701784700001701801700001801818773009301836852000901929856007901938856005802017655001202075IND4380872920221118000725.0060608s2006    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438087292DNAL7 a167355472pmid7 a10.1530/rep.1.010652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Shangang10aRabbits generated from fibroblasts through nuclear transfer  ap. 1085-1090.  aIncludes references  aSomatic cell nuclear transfer offers new opportunities for genetic engineering and genome preservation in mammalian animal species.

Nuclear transfer embryos constructed using serum-starved fibroblasts showed a significantly higher developmental rate than non-starved fibroblasts through preimplantation stages. A total of 467 nuclear transfer embryos were transferred into the oviducts of pseudo pregnant mothers. Eight of the 20 surrogate rabbits carried the pregnancy to term and five of them gave birth naturally to a total of nine rabbits. However, all of the offspring died before postnatal day 10. A Caesarean section was performed on three surrogates, giving birth to a total of five rabbits, three of them survived and grew into healthy adults. DNA analyses confirmed that these rabbits were genetically identical to the donor male rabbit. The present study demonstrates that rabbits can be cloned from adult fibroblasts after culture. 3aDNA 3aadults 3acesarean section 3afibroblasts 3agenetic engineering 3agenome 3aoviducts 3apregnancy 3aprogeny 3arabbits 3asomatic cells 2aAnimals 2aCloning, Organism 2aEmbryo Transfer 2aEmbryonic Development 2aFemale 2aFibroblastsxultrastructure 2aMale 2aMicrosatellite Repeats 2aNuclear Transfer Techniques 2aPseudopregnancy 2aRabbits1 aChen, Xuejin1 aFang, Zhenfu1 aShi, Jianjun1 aSheng, Hui Z.0 tReproduction.g2006 June, v. 131, no. 6 p.1085-1090dBioScientifica Ltdx1470-16267nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1530/rep.1.010653Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.srf-reproduction.org/3electronic resource 7aarticle03580naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002900111040001800140100001100158245011200169300001600281500002400297520172900321650002202050650001102072650002802083650001202111650002102123650001302144650001302157650000802170650002602178650001102204650001602215650001602231650001202247650001202259650002502271650001102296650003102307650001402338650001802352650003002370650003002400650004002430650003202470650001602502650002702518650000902545650002302554650003202577650001902609650002802628700001402656700001602670700002002686773009002706852000902796856007902805856005802884655001202942IND4380874520221118000634.0060608s2006    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438087452DNAL7 a166723522pmid7 a10.1530/rep.1.009952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, G.10aEffect of glycerol and cholesterol-loaded cyclodextrin on freezing-induced water loss in bovine spermatozoa  ap. 875-886.  aIncludes references  aRecent experimental data show that incubating bovine sperm with cholesterol-loaded cyclodextrin (CLC) before cryopreservation increases the percentages of motile and viable cells recovered after freezing and thawing, compared with control sperm. In the present study, we report the effect of incubating bovine sperm with CLC on the subzero water transport response and the membrane permeability parameters (reference membrane permeability (Lpg) and activation energy (ELp)). Water transport data during freezing of bovine sperm cell suspensions were obtained at a cooling rate of 20 °C/min under three different conditions: 1. in the absence of cryoprotective agents (CPAs); 2. in the presence of 0.7 M glycerol; and 3. in the presence of 1.5 mg/ml CLC and 0.7 M glycerol. With previously published values, the bovine sperm cell was modeled as a cylinder of length 39.8 μm and radius 0.4 μm, with osmotically inactive cell volume (Vb) of 0.61 Vo, where Vo is the isotonic cell volume. By fitting a model of water transport to the experimentally obtained data, the best-fit water transport parameters (Lpg and ELp) were determined. The predicted best-fit permeability parameters ranged from Lpg = 0.02 to 0.036 μm/min-atm and ELp = 26.4 to 42.1 kcal/mol. These subzero water transport parameters are significantly different from the suprazero membrane permeability values (obtained in the absence of extracellular ice) reported in the literature. Calculations made of the theoretical response of bovine spermatozoa at subzero temperatures suggest that the optimal cooling rate to cryopreserve bovine spermatozoa is 45-60 °C/min, agreeing quite closely with experimentally determined rates of freezing bovine spermatozoa. 3aactivation energy 3acattle 3acell suspension culture 3acooling 3acryopreservation 3afreezing 3aglycerol 3aice 3amembrane permeability 3amodels 3aspermatozoa 3atemperature 3athawing 2aAnimals 2aBiological Transport 2aCattle 2aCell Membrane Permeability 2aCell Size 2aCell Survival 2aCholesterolxpharmacology 2aCryopreservationxmethods 2aCryoprotective Agentsxpharmacology 2aCyclodextrinsxpharmacology 2aDehydration 2aGlycerolxpharmacology 2aMale 2aModels, Biological 2aSemen Preservationxmethods 2aSperm Motility 2aSpermatozoaxmetabolism1 aSaenz, J.1 aGodke, R.A.1 aDevireddy, R.V.0 tReproduction.g2006 May, v. 131, no. 5 p.875-886dBioScientifica Ltdx1470-16267nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1530/rep.1.009953Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.srf-reproduction.org/3electronic resource 7aarticle04268naa a2200757 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002900111040001800140100002700158245015600185300001600341500002400357520185500381650002102236650001502257650001102272650001402283650002402297650001802321650001402339650002002353650001802373650001202391650001402403650002202417650002702439650001102466650001202477650001802489650002502507650003102532650001102563650002002574650002602594650002602620650001102646650002702657650004602684650002002730650002802750650005602778650001402834650005502848650002102903650005002924650005202974650002603026650002703052700001903079700001803098700002103116700001903137700001803156700002403174700002303198700002203221700001903243773009003262852000903352856007903361856005803440655001203498IND4380874420111107000000.0060608s2006    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438087442DNAL7 a166723512pmid7 a10.1530/rep.1.010402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNganvongpanit, Korakot10aSelective degradation of maternal and embryonic transcripts in in vitro produced bovine oocytes and embryos using sequence specific double-stranded RNA  ap. 861-874.  aIncludes references  aRNA interference (RNAi) has been used for selective degradation of an mRNA transcript or inhibiting its translation to a functional protein in various species. Here, we applied the RNAi approach to suppress the expression of the maternal transcript C-mos and embryonic transcripts Oct-4 in bovine oocytes and embryos respectively, using microinjection of sequence-specific double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). For this, 435 bp C-mos and 341 bp Oct-4 dsRNA were synthesized and microinjected into the cytoplasm of immature oocytes and zygotes respectively. In experiment 1, immature oocytes were categorized into three groups: those injected with C-mos dsRNA, RNase-free water and uninjected controls. In experiment 2, in vitro produced zygotes were categorized into three groups: those injected with Oct-4 dsRNA, RNase-free water and uninjected controls. The developmental phenotypes, the level of mRNA and protein expression were investigated after treatment in both experiments. Microinjection of C-mos dsRNA has resulted in 70% reduction of C-mos transcript after maturation compared to the water-injected and uninjected controls (P<0.01). Microinjection of zygotes with Oct-4 dsRNA has resulted in 72% reduction in transcript abundance at the blastocyst stage compared to the uninjected control zygotes (P<0.01). Moreover, a significant reduction in the number of inner cell mass (ICM) cells was observed in Oct-4 dsRNA-injected embryos compared to the other groups. From oocytes injected with C-mos dsRNA, 60% showed the extrusion of the first polar body compared to 50% in water-injected and 44% in uninjected controls. Moreover, only oocytes injected with C-mos dsRNA showed spontaneous activation. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that sequence-specific dsRNA can be used to knockdown maternal or embryonic transcripts in bovine embryogenesis. 3aRNA interference 3ablastocyst 3acattle 3acytoplasm 3adouble-stranded RNA 3aembryogenesis 3aextrusion 3agene expression 3amessenger RNA 3aoocytes 3aphenotype 3aprotein synthesis 3atranslation (genetics) 3azygote 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aBlastocystxcytology 2aBlotting, Westernxmethods 2aCattle 2aCells, Cultured 2aDNA Primersxgenetics 2aEmbryonic Development 2aFemale 2aFertilization in Vitro 2aGene Expression Regulation, Developmental 2aMicroinjections 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOctamer Transcription Factor-3xanalysisxgenetics. 2aOogenesis 2aProto-Oncogene Proteins c-mosxanalysisxgenetics. 2aRNA Interference 2aRNA, Double-Strandedxadministration & dosage 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aStaining and Labeling 2aTranscription, Genetic1 aMüller, Heike1 aRings, Franca1 aHoelker, Michael1 aJennen, Danyel1 aTholen, Ernst1 aHavlicek, Vitezslav1 aBesenfelder, Urban1 aSchellander, Karl1 aTesfaye, Dawit0 tReproduction.g2006 May, v. 131, no. 5 p.861-874dBioScientifica Ltdx1470-16267nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1530/rep.1.010403Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.srf-reproduction.org/3electronic resource 7aarticle04255naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003000133040001800163100002500181245013300206300001800339500002400357506007600381520211500457506003702572650002902609650002702638650002702665650001702692650001302709650002102722650001002743650001602753650000902769650001202778650001302790650002402803650001802827650001402845650001402859650002202873650001302895650002302908650001302931650002402944650001202968650005702980650001803037650003203055650003803087650003003125650000903155650002803164650005503192650002203247700001903269700002103288700002103309773011703330852000903447856008003456856004503536655001203581IND4380724020221207130727.0060607s2006    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438072402DNAL7 a167145922pmid7 aPMC14792362pmcid7 a10.1128/IAI.02060-052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVanRheenen, Susan M.10aMembers of a Legionella pneumophila Family of Proteins with ExoU (Phospholipase A) Active Sites Are Translocated to Target Cells  ap. 3597-3606.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aLegionellapneumophila replicates within alveolar macrophages, causing asevere pneumonia termed Legionnaires' disease. The bacterium resideswithin a vacuole that escapes immediate transport to the host lysosome.Instead, the vacuole interacts with the early secretory pathway toestablish an environment suitable for rapid multiplication. A type IVsecretion system is central to the pathogenicity of the bacterium, andmany protein substrates that are translocated by this system to thehost cell have been identified. One of these, VipD, was found tointerrupt the late secretory pathway when overproduced inSaccharomyces cerevisiae. We independently identified VipD ina previous study and have further characterized this protein as well asits three paralogs. The vipD gene belongs to a family ofL. pneumophila open reading frames that are predicted tocontain a phospholipase A domain with sequence similarity to the typeIII-secreted toxin ExoU from Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Similarlyto other known translocated proteins of L. pneumophila, VipDis strongly induced in early stationary phase, a time when thebacterium is most virulent. Detergent extraction studies of infectedmacrophages confirm that VipD is translocated into host cells via thetype IV secretion system. A second assay for translocation revealedthat two paralogs of VipD, VpdA and VpdB, also have translocationsignals recognized by the type IV system. A strain lacking VipD and itsthree paralogs grew at wild-type rates in murine macrophages, althoughsecondary mutations that cause growth defects in strains lacking VipDaccumulate. The quadruple mutant displayed a growth advantage in theamoebal host Dictyostelium discoideum, indicating that theprotein family may modulate intracellular growth in a complex fashion.VipD is mildly toxic when overproduced in eukaryotic cells, and thetoxicity is partially dependent on the putative phospholipase activesite. VipD and its paralogs therefore define a family of translocatedproteins that may assist in the establishment of a vacuole suitable forbacterial replication through functioning as aphospholipase.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDictyostelium discoideum 3aLegionella pneumophila 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aactive sites 3abacteria 3aeukaryotic cells 3agenes 3amacrophages 3amice 3amutants 3amutation 3aopen reading frames 3apathogenicity 3apneumonia 3asecretion 3asequence homology 3atoxicity 3atransport proteins 3avacuoles 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aBacterial Proteinsxchemistryxmetabolismxtoxicity. 2aBinding Sites 2aDictyosteliumxmicrobiology 2aLegionella pneumophilaxchemistry 2aMacrophagesxmicrobiology 2aMice 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhospholipases Axchemistryxmetabolismxtoxicity. 2aProtein Transport1 aLuo, Zhao-Qing1 aO'Connor, Tamara1 aIsberg, Ralph R.0 tInfection and immunity.g2006 June, v. 74, no. 6 p.3597-3606dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0019-95677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/IAI.02060-053Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://iai.asm.org/3electronic resource 7aarticle02224naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003000133040001800163100002400181245012500205300001800330500002400348506007600372520042500448506003700873650003100910650002000941650001600961650000900977650001700986650001701003650001201020650002501032650002401057650003001081650003801111650004301149650000901192650004401201650002701245700002701272700002201299700002601321700001801347700002601365700001801391700002201409773011701431852000901548856008001557856004501637655001201682IND4380724820221207130641.0060607s2006    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438072482DNAL7 a167146002pmid7 aPMC14792972pmcid7 a10.1128/IAI.00196-062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOrlova, Marianna O.10aConstitutive Differences in Gene Expression Profiles Parallel Genetic Patterns of Susceptibility to Tuberculosis in Mice  ap. 3668-3672.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aInterstitial lung macrophages from tuberculosis-susceptible I/St and tuberculosis-resistant A/Sn mice demonstrated significant constitutive differences in gene expression levels, whereas in vitro infection of these cells with Mycobacterium tuberculosis had only a modulatory impact on gene expression.

One disadvantage of these materials is cure induced or thermally induced residual stresses in the matrix, which may result in deteriorated performance and premature failure. This article explores the use of epoxy/multifunctional polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS) nanocomposites as resins with reduced thermal stress coefficients that result in mitigated residual stresses. The effect of POSS loading on the thermal stress coefficient of the epoxy/POSS nanocomposite resins was investigated from below the β-relaxation to the α-relaxation, or glass transition temperature, (i.e., from -100 to 180 °C) by measuring the shear modulus and linear thermal expansion coefficient. The thermal stress coefficient of the epoxy/POSS nanocomposites is found to be a strong function of temperature, decreasing rapidly with decreasing temperature through the α-relaxation region, increasing in the vicinity of the β-relaxation, and then decreasing below the temperature associated with the peak in the β-relaxation. With increasing POSS content, the thermal stress coefficient is reduced compared with the neat resin in the vicinity of the α-relaxation; however, the thermal stress coefficient increases with increasing POSS content below the temperature of the β-relaxation peak. 3aepoxides 3aglass transition temperature 3amodulus of elasticity 3ananocomposites 3apolymers 3aresins 3athermal expansion 3athermal stress 3aviscoelasticity1 aHutcheson, Stephen A.1 aMcKenna, Gregory B.1 aSimon, Sindee L.0 tJournal of polymer science.g2008 Dec. 15, v. 46, no. 24 p.2719-2732dWiley Subscription Services, Inc., A Wiley Companyx0887-62667nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/polb.216093Available from publisher's Web site  a20081121b20081206c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02719naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120100001700138245006500155300001800220520172600238650001201964650003801976650001302014650003302027650000902060650001102069650001702080700002102097773014202118852000902260856007802269930003302347946001302380655001202393IND4412994720221118000341.0081121e20081215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441299472DNAL7 a10.1002/polb.215982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoh, Yung P.10aStructural relaxation of stacked ultrathin polystyrene films  ap. 2741-2753.  aThe Tg depression and kinetic behavior of stacked polystyrene ultrathin films is investigated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and compared with the behavior of bulk polystyrene. The fictive temperature (Tf) was measured as a function of cooling rate and as a function of aging time for aging temperatures below the nominal glass transition temperature (Tg). The stacked ultrathin films show enthalpy overshoots in DSC heating scans which are reduced in height but occur over a broader temperature range relative to the bulk response for a given change in fictive temperature. The cooling rate dependence of the limiting fictive temperature, Tf', is also found to be higher for the stacked ultrathin film samples; the result is that the magnitude of the Tg depression between the ultrathin film sample and the bulk is inversely related to the cooling rate. We also find that the rate of physical aging of the stacked ultrathin films is comparable with the bulk when aging is performed at the same distance from Tg; however, when conducted at the same aging temperature, the ultrathin film samples show accelerated physical aging, that is, a shorter time is required to reach equilibrium for the thin films due to their depressed Tg values. The smaller distance from Tg also results in a reduced logarithmic aging rate for the thin films compared with the bulk, although this is not indicative of longer relaxation times. The DSC heating curves obtained as a function of cooling rate and aging history are modeled using the Tool-Narayanaswamy-Moynihan model of structural recovery; the stacked ultrathin film samples show lower β values than the bulk, consistent with a broader distribution of relaxation times. 3acooling 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3aenthalpy 3aglass transition temperature 3aheat 3amodels 3apolystyrenes1 aSimon, Sindee L.0 tJournal of polymer science.g2008 Dec. 15, v. 46, no. 24 p.2741-2753dWiley Subscription Services, Inc., A Wiley Companyx0887-62667nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/polb.215983Available from publisher's Web site  a20081121b20081206c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03852naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245012700164300001600291500002400307520249200331650002502823650002402848650002002872650002502892650002102917650001302938650001202951650002302963650002202986650001903008650001303027650002203040650001503062651001503077653001403092653001903106653002403125653002203149653001903171653002203190700001903212773009403231852000903325856004803334655001203382IND4398546620221118001105.0071209e200802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439854662DNAL7 a10.1007/s11258-007-9283-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLoya, David T.10aUse of species richness estimators improves evaluation of understory plant response to logging: a study of redwood forests  ap. 179-194.  aIncludes references  aThe recovery of native understory plant communities after timber harvest has received a great amount of attention worldwide. However, most of these studies have ignored the potentially significant effects that differences in habitat across forest development may have on the species-area relationship, even though sampling efficacy among forest developmental stages may differ markedly as a result of equal sampling within stages. We examined vascular plant community structure in coastal redwood forests of northern California (USA) in forest patches in each of four forest stages that develop with forest age: Initiation, Closure, Mature, and Old-growth. We also used a set of traditional and novel approaches to assess sampling efficacy and guide our sampling design. We initially sampled 75 circular plots (0.04 ha) in stands within each forest stage across a 1,347 km² area. The species-area relationship suggested we had adequately sampled all stages after the first season of data collection, but non-parametric richness estimators (Incidence-based Coverage Estimator or ICE) and Michaelis-Menten means (MMMeans) rarefaction curves, indicated inadequate sampling of the older stages. Thus, we added four more samples within the Old-growth forest stage, establishing a more equitable sample of all stages. Our full data set demonstrated significant differences between plant communities in previously harvested forests ('managed' = Initiation, Closure, and Mature) and 'unmanaged' forests (Old-growth). Though several understory species were present in all stages, a suite of Old-growth indicator and restricted species suggest that recovery of some species may take long periods in managed forests. Interestingly, a separate suite of common understory species were lacking in Old-growth, and species richness in this stage was lower than in the mature managed forests. We discuss how this departure from the prediction of peak richness in Old-growth may relate to fire suppression in Old-growth forests. Lastly, analysis of our initial, smaller sampling of plots suggested that Old-growth plots were the least species rich. However, additional sampling of the Old-growth stage demonstrated that Old-growth plots were as rich as Closure plots. This has important implications for all studies concerned with measuring recovery after forest disturbances; stage-dependent habitat-mediated differences that affect sampling efficacy may not be captured by traditional sampling methods. 3aSequoia sempervirens 3acommunity structure 3adata collection 3adevelopmental stages 3afire suppression 3ahabitats 3alogging 3aold-growth forests 3aplant communities 3aplant response 3asampling 3aspecies diversity 3aunderstory 3aCalifornia 0aDiversity 0aRedwood forest 0aRichness estimators 0aSampling efficacy 0aTimber harvest 0aUnderstory plants1 aJules, Erik S.0 tPlant ecology.g2008 Feb., v. 194, no. 2 p.179-194dSpringer Netherlandsx1385-02377nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11258-007-9283-z 7aarticle02919naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100001700156245008600173300001600259520151700275650002301792650001501815650002201830650002301852650002101875650005901896650001501955650003701970650004102007650002402048650001802072650003902090700001702129700002402146700001602170700001502186700001502201773010002216852000902316856007702325930003302402945001302435946001302448655001202461IND2325693420221118000857.0020228e200101  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232569342DNAL7 a111705692pmid7 a10.1021/jf000850y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarcia, P.C.10aDirect action of the biocide carbendazim on phenolic metabolism in tobacco plants  ap. 131-137.  aIn view of the essential role of phenolic compounds in the development of pathogen resistance in plants, and given the influence that fungicides exert over phenolic metabolism, the aim of the present study was to determine the effect of the application of different rates of fungicide on the metabolism of phenolic compounds in tobacco plants (Nicotiana tabacum L. cv. Tennessee 86). The fungicide applied was carbendazim, with a purity of 100%, at three different rates: 1.3 mM (carb1), 2.6 mM (this being the recommended concentration, carb2), and 5.2 mM (carb3). The control treatment was without carbendazim. The results in relation to control plants indicate that the application of carb1 in tobacco plants not afflicted by damaging biotic and abiotic agents boosts phenolic accumulation. Therefore, in the case of carbendazim, the application of 50% less (carb1, 1.3 mM) than the recommended dosage (carb2, 2.6 mM) of this fungicide could be more effective, because the foliar accumulation of phenolics presented at carb1 may imply an increased resistance of plants to pathogen infection. On the other hand, we found an inhibition of the phenolic oxidation by the application of carbendazim, principally at carb3. These results suggest that the excessive application of carbendazim (5.2 mM) could be harmful for healthy plants, because, on inhibiting phenolic metabolism (biosynthesis and oxidation), such treatment would also sharply reduce the capacity of these plants to respond against pathogen attack. 3aphenolic compounds 3ametabolism 3aNicotiana tabacum 3adefense mechanisms 3aapplication rate 2aBenzimidazolesxadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aCarbamates 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aFungicides, Industrialxpharmacology 2aPhenolsxmetabolism 2aPlants, Toxic 2aTobaccoxdrug effectsxmetabolism.1 aRivero, R.M.1 aLopez-Lefebre, L.R.1 aSanchez, E.1 aRuiz, J.M.1 aRomero, L.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2001 Jan., v. 49, no. 1 p.131-137x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf000850y3Available from publisher's Web site  a20020501b20020507c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle02114naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245010800163300001600271500002400287520110400311650001301415650002901428650002001457650001401477650001601491650001101507650001201518650001701530650001801547651001001565700002101575773011101596852000901707856004801716655001201764IND4422480420221118000825.0090626e200908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442248042DNAL7 a10.1007/s11273-008-9117-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTabayashi, Yu10aChanges in the impact of anthropogenic effects on river water quality during the last 50 years in Japan  ap. 409-415.  aIncludes references  aJapan's rapid urbanisation over the last 50 years has resulted in land use and lifestyle changes, all of which are likely to have changed the quality of river water, and consequently the wetland and coastal environment. We examined changes in river water quality over this period by means of a review of previous studies. Around the 1950s, the weighted average of chloride using discharge of Japan's 30 major rivers was 6.1 mg/l while in the 2000s it was 11.3 mg/l. Because there were no significant changes in the natural conditions, we have attributed the increase to the urbanisation of the last 50 years. Nitrate levels in the mountain streams of southern Japan have increased, particularly in the western part of the Kanto region. As this area is located on the leeward side of the Tokyo Metropolitan Area, depositions from aerosols are thought to be the main cause of the increased nitrate concentration. These two findings suggest that certain uses of land may affect river water quality differently over time, and that changes in land use may also affect river water quality in remote areas. 3aaerosols 3aanthropogenic activities 3aland use change 3alifestyle 3ariver water 3arivers 3astreams 3aurbanization 3awater quality 3aJapan1 aYamamuro, Masumi0 tWetlands ecology and management.g2009 Aug., v. 17, no. 4 p.409-415dSpringer Netherlandsx0923-48617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11273-008-9117-3 7aarticle03619naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001500129245013800144300001800282500002400300520177000324650001102094650001802105650001702123650001802140650001602158650001402174650001602188650000902204650002002213650002002233650002602253650002002279650001502299650001502314650001802329650001102347650000902358650001302367650004302380650001202423650003202435650003602467650002902503650002802532650003402560650003802594650002902632650003802661650001902699650003702718650000902755650000902764650003902773700001402812700001602826700001502842773011502857852000902972655001202981IND4371620320221118001207.0050621e200410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437162032DNAL7 a154657372pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJung, U.J.14aThe hypoglycemic effects of hesperidin and naringin are partly mediated by hepatic glucose-regulating enzymes in C57BL/KsJ-db/db mice  ap. 2499-2503.  aIncludes references  aDietary antioxidant compounds such as bioflavonoids may offer some protection against the early stage of diabetes mellitus and the development of complications. We investigated the effect of citrus bioflavonoids on blood glucose level, hepatic glucose-regulating enzymes activities, hepatic glycogen concentration, and plasma insulin levels, and assessed the relations between plasma leptin and body weight, blood glucose, and plasma insulin. Male C57BL/KsJ-db/db mice (db/db mice, 5 wk old), an animal model for type 2 diabetes, were fed a nonpurified diet for 2 wk and then were fed an AIN-76 control diet or the control diet supplemented with hesperidin (0.2 g/kg diet) or naringin (0.2 g/kg diet). Hesperidin and naringin supplementation significantly reduced blood glucose compared with the control group. Hepatic glucokinase activity and glycogen concentration were both significantly elevated in the hesperidin- and the naringin-supplemented groups compared with the control group. Naringin also markedly lowered the activity of hepatic glucose-6-phosphatase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase compared with the control group. Plasma insulin, C-peptide, and leptin levels in the db/db mice from the 2 bioflavonoid-supplemented groups were significantly higher than those of the control group. Furthermore, plasma leptin was positively correlated with plasma insulin level (r = 0.578, P < 0.01) and body weight (r = 0.541, P < 0.05), and was inversely correlated with the blood glucose level (r = -0.46, P < 0.05). The current results suggest that hesperidin and naringin both play important roles in preventing the progression of hyperglycemia, partly by increasing hepatic glycolysis and glycogen concentration and/or by lowering hepatic gluconeogenesis. 3aCitrus 3aanimal models 3aantioxidants 3ablood glucose 3abody weight 3ac-peptide 3acorrelation 3adiet 3aenzyme activity 3agluconeogenesis 3aglucose-6-phosphatase 3aglycemic effect 3aglycolysis 3ahesperidin 3ahyperglycemia 3aleptin 3amice 3anaringin 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 2aAnimals 2aBlood Glucosexdrug effects 2aDiabetes Mellitus, Experimental 2aFlavanonesxpharmacology 2aGlucokinasexmetabolism 2aGluconeogenesisxdrug effects 2aGlucose-6-Phosphatasexmetabolism 2aHesperidinxpharmacology 2aHypoglycemic Agentsxpharmacology 2aInsulinxblood 2aLiverxdrug effectsxenzymology. 2aMale 2aMice 2aPancreasxdrug effectsxpathology.1 aLee, M.K.1 aJeong, K.S.1 aChoi, M.S.0 tJournal of nutrition.g2004 Oct., v. 134, no. 10 p.2499-2503dAmerican Institute of Nutritionx0022-31667nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02206naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120100001600138245007800154300001800232500001500250520097900265650001401244650002101258650001101279650001001290650002101300650001001321650000901331650001301340650001001353650001501363650002101378650002101399650000901420653001501429700001601444700002001460700001701480700001701497773007601514852000901590856007801599930003301677945001301710946001301723655001201736IND2038194320221118000414.0940324e199310  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203819432DNAL7 a10.3382/ps.07219312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRossi, A.F.14aThe effect of feeding two sources of boron on broiler breeder performance  ap. 1931-1934.  a2019-12-04  aTwo experiments were conducted to study the effects of dietary boron supplementations of 0 and 250 ppm fed as either boric acid or sodium tetraborate (borax).

It was therefore of interest to determine whether intermittent feeding of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), a known GH secretagogue, would elevate plasma GH of 7- to 10-wk-old broilers and alter their growth characteristics. Four replicate pens of 15 males and four pens of 15 females 7 to 10 wk of age were given access to feed containing 3.5 mg/kg of TRH for four 2-h periods each 24 h with 4-h periods of feed removal between. Control groups either were fed the basal ration on the same intermittent schedule or had continuous access to it. Growth hormone concentrations, measured 45 to 75 min after the start of TRH feeding periods, were significantly elevated in males on the 1st day of the experiment and after 7,14, and 21 days when they were 7,8,9, and 10 wk of age, respectively. Concentrations in females were elevated on the 1st day of treatment, but not thereafter. Treatment with TRH had no effect on BW or relative gain of males at any time. It significantly increased relative gain of females during the 1st wk, but not thereafter. There were no treatment effects on 10-wk shank length, Pectoralis major weight, Gastrocnemius weight, or liver weight in either sex, but the percentage fat pad of males fed TRH was lower than that of controls fed intermittently. 3abroiler chickens 3athyrotropin-releasing hormone 3ablood plasma 3asomatotropin 3agender differences 3abody weight 3afeed conversion 3aliveweight gain 3aliver 3amuscles 3aweight 3acarcass weight 3aabdominal fat 2aAdministration, Oral 2aAnimals 2aBody Weightxdrug effects 2aChickensxgrowth & development 2aFemale 2aGrowth Hormonexbloodxdrug effects. 2aMale 2aThyrotropin-Releasing Hormonexadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 0ashanks1 aBurke, W.H.0 tPoultry science.g1993 Oct., v. 72, no. 10 p.1952-1960x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps.07219523Available from publisher's Web site  a19940415b19940418c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle02199naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120100001600138245010500154300001800259520126500277650000901542650002501551650001601576650001501592650001001607650001601617700001801633773007601651852000901727856007801736930003301814945001301847946001301860655001201873IND2038197220221117235958.0940324e199310  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203819722DNAL7 a10.3382/ps.07219892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNaber, E.C.10aEarly detection of the absence of a vitamin premix in layer diets by egg albumen riboflavin analysis  ap. 1989-1993.  aFour groups of laying hens were fed a corn and soybean meal basal diet without vitamin supplementation, with riboflavin, with other vitamins, or with riboflavin and other vitamins for 3 wk. They were then fed a recovery diet for 1 wk. Egg production rate was unaffected by the absence of vitamin supplements. Egg weight was significantly reduced by riboflavin deficiency and the absence of other vitamins and further reduced by the absence of both riboflavin and the other vitamins. Egg hatchability was markedly reduced by riboflavin deficiency in the presence or absence of other vitamins. Egg albumen riboflavin concentrations dropped within 4 to 6 days in eggs from hens fed the diets without riboflavin or all supplemental vitamins. Albumen color scores in eggs from hens fed diets without supplemental riboflavin dropped in 2 days and continued to decline. The correlation coefficient of egg albumen riboflavin content with egg albumen color score was very high (r = .96). It appears that egg albumen riboflavin concentrations or egg albumen color scores can be used not only to assess nutritional status of the hen for this vitamin but also as a quality control measure in feed formulation and mixing for the presence of vitamin supplements in the diet. 3ahens 3avitamin deficiencies 3aegg albumen 3ariboflavin 3acolor 3aegg quality1 aSquires, M.W.0 tPoultry science.g1993 Oct., v. 72, no. 10 p.1989-1993x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps.07219893Available from publisher's Web site  a19940415b19940418c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle03061naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002800110040001800138100001900156245013700175300001800312520147700330650002101807650001901828650001201847650002301859650002201882650001601904650001501920650002501935650001201960650007601972650002702048650004002075650002702115650002202142650003602164650002302200650002102223650003702244700001802281700001702299700001702316773007602333852000902409856007802418930003302496945001302529946001302542655001202555IND2037570620221117235931.0940228e199311  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203757062DNAL7 a82655022pmid7 a10.3382/ps.07221522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFletcher, D.L.13aAn evaluation of a rinse procedure using sodium bicarbonate and hydrogen peroxide on the recovery of bacteria from broiler carcasses  ap. 2152-2156.  aA patent entitled "Reduction of Bacteria Count on Poultry Being Processed into Food at a Poultry Processing Plant"- (U.S. Patent No. 4,683,618) claimed that a three-step rinse process using sodium bicarbonate and hydrogen peroxide solutions would remove bacteria from the surface of broiler carcasses. In three replicate trials, 40 broilers were obtained postchill from a commercial processing plant. Broilers (n=20) were treated according to the patent by spraying the inside and outside surfaces of each carcass with a 2% NaHCO3 solution for 5 s and rinsing with water, repeating, spraying with a 3% H202 solution for 5 s, and rinsing a final time with water. Controls (n=20) were treated identically except that in each of the rinse steps tap water was used in place of the test solutions. Whole carcass rinses were conducted and total aerobic plate counts (TPC) and impedance detection times (DT) were determined after 1 h and 7 days at 4 degrees C. The NaHCO3 + H202 treatment resulted in no significant difference in TPC at 1 h post-treatment but did result in lower TPC after 7 days and greater DT at both 1 h and 7 days. The procedure was effective in reducing the recovery of bacteria at 7 days post-treatment by .3 log(10) but was not effective in removing the bacteria to the extent implied in the patent. Based on previous studies using H2O2, these results are not unexpected, but commercial applicability remains questionable based on actual reduction levels. 3abroiler chickens 3ameat carcasses 3awashing 3asodium bicarbonate 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aplate count 3ashelf life 2aAnalysis of Variance 2aAnimals 2aBacteriaxdrug effectsxgrowth & developmentxisolation & purification. 2aChickensxmicrobiology 2aColony Count, Microbialxveterinary 2aFood Handlingxmethods 2aFood Microbiology 2aHydrogen Peroxidexpharmacology 2aMeatxmicrobiology 2aPatents as Topic 2aSodium Bicarbonatexpharmacology1 aRussell, S.M.1 aWalker, J.M.1 aBailey, J.S.0 tPoultry science.g1993 Nov., v. 72, no. 11 p.2152-2156x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps.07221523Available from publisher's Web site  a19940415b19940418c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle03244naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092024002200122024001900144040001800163100002100181245011700202300001600319500002400335506007600359520169400435506003702129650002202166650002102188650001602209650002102225650001602246650001002262650001902272650002502291650001802316650001802334650001302352650001102365651001902376700001602395700002702411700002602438700002202464700002102486700002002507773013402527852000902661856008002670655001202750IND4448399020221207101800.0110126e20110115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444839902DNAL7 a10.1128/AEM.01457-102doi7 aPMC30205462pmcid7 a210975832pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHoward, Erinn C.10aChanges in Dimethylsulfoniopropionate Demethylase Gene Assemblages in Response to an Induced Phytoplankton Bloom  ap. 524-531.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aOver half of the bacterioplankton cells in ocean surface waters are capable of carrying out a demethylation of the phytoplankton metabolite dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) that routes the sulfur moiety away from the climatically active gas dimethylsulfide (DMS). In this study, we tracked changes in dmdA, the gene responsible for DMSP demethylation, over the course of an induced phytoplankton bloom in Gulf of Mexico seawater microcosms. Analysis of >91,000 amplicon sequences indicated 578 different dmdA sequence clusters at a conservative clustering criterion of ≥90% nucleotide sequence identity over the 6-day study. The representation of the major clades of dmdA, several of which are linked to specific taxa through genomes of cultured marine bacterioplankton, remained fairly constant. However, the representation of clusters within these major clades shifted significantly in response to the bloom, including two Roseobacter-like clusters and a SAR11-like cluster, and the best correlate with shifts of the dominant dmdA clades was chlorophyll a concentration. Concurrent 16S rRNA amplification and sequencing indicated the presence of Roseobacter, SAR11, OM60, and marine Rhodospirillales populations, all of which are known to harbor dmdA genes, although the largest taxonomic change was an increase in Flavobacteriaceae, a group not yet demonstrated to have DMSP-demethylating capabilities. Sequence heterogeneity in dmdA and other functional gene populations is becoming increasingly evident with the advent of high-throughput sequencing technologies, and understanding the ecological implications of this heterogeneity is a major challenge for marine microbial ecology.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aFlavobacteriaceae 3aRhodospirillales 3aRoseobacter 3abacterioplankton 3achlorophyll 3agenes 3amarine science 3anucleotide sequences 3aphytoplankton 3aribosomal RNA 3aseawater 3asulfur 3aGulf of Mexico1 aSun, Shulei1 aReisch, Christopher R.1 adel Valle, Daniela A.1 aBürgmann, Helmut1 aKiene, Ronald P.1 aMoran, Mary Ann0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2011 Jan. 15, v. 77, no. 2 p.524-531dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.01457-103Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02601naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120100001700138245011900155300001800274520137900292650001201671650002001683650001901703650001601722650002401738650002101762650001801783650001401801650001001815700001701825700001601842700001901858700001401877700001901891700001801910700001701928773007601945852000902021856007802030930003302108945001302141946001302154655001202167IND2037570020221117235906.0940228e199311  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203757002DNAL7 a10.3382/ps.07221442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aClarke, J.P.10aEarly dietary protein restriction and intermittent lighting. 2. Effects on carcass characteristics of male turkeys  ap. 2144-2151.  aA trial was conducted to determine the effects of dietary protein restriction at an early age and intermittent lighting, designed for curtain-sided houses, on the carcass characteristics of Nicholas commercial male turkeys (sired by male Line 88). Four isocaloric diets containing various levels of protein (100, 90,80, or 70% of control values) were fed ad libitum from 8 to 56 days of age. AU birds were fed control diets from 1 to 7 days of age, and from 57 to 124 days of age. Two fighting regimens, a control of 15 h light (L):9 h dark (D), and intermittent (15L:2D:1.5L:2D:1.5L:2D), were each assigned randomly to two rooms from Day 8 until the end of the study. Turkeys reared in intermittent fighting had heavier weights for whole breast (muscle and bone, P <.06) and breast muscle (without bone, P <.07) than those of the control (15L:9D) photoperiod. Toms fed the 90% protein diet in both lighting regimens had carcass part weights and yields similar to the controls. The weight of the breast and breast muscle and the percentage yield of breast and breast muscle decreased in birds fed the 80 and 70% CP diets. It is concluded that Nicholas commercial male turkeys can be reared in intermittent lighting and can be fed dietary protein levels at 90% of the control level from 8 to 56 days of age without negatively affecting the weights or yields of carcass parts. 3aturkeys 3adietary protein 3aprotein intake 3aphotoperiod 3acarcass composition 3aslaughter weight 3acarcass yield 3ameat cuts 3amales1 aFerket, P.R.1 aElkin, R.G.1 aMcDaniel, C.D.1 aFreed, M.1 aMcMurtry, J.P.1 aKrueger, K.K.1 aHester, P.Y.0 tPoultry science.g1993 Nov., v. 72, no. 11 p.2144-2151x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps.07221443Available from publisher's Web site  a19940415b19940418c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle03519naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002100152245010400173300001600277500002400293520248400317650002002801650001202821650001902833650002602852650001302878650001502891650001102906650001302917650001902930700002102949700002502970773011002995852000903105856005503114655001203169IND4457951320221117235941.0110513e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445795132DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2664.2011.01970.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSawyer, Sarah C.10aPlacing linkages among fragmented habitats: do least-cost models reflect how animals use landscapes  ap. 668-678.  aIncludes references  a1. The need to conserve and create linkages among fragmented habitats has given rise to a range of techniques for maximizing connectivity. Methods to identify optimal habitat linkages face trade-offs between constraints on model inputs and biological relevance of model outputs. Given the popularity of these methods and their central role in landscape planning, it is critical that they be reliable and robust. 2. The most popular method used to inform habitat linkage design, least-cost path (LCP) analysis, designates a landscape resistance surface based on hypothetical ‘costs' that landscape components impose on species movement, and identifies paths that minimize cumulative costs between locations. 3. While LCP analysis represents a valuable method for conservation planning, its current application has several weaknesses. Here, we review LCP analysis and identify shortcomings of its current application that decrease biological relevance and conservation utility. We examine trends in published LCP analyses, demonstrate the implications of methodological choices with our own LCP analysis for bighorn sheep Ovis canadensis nelsoni, and point to future directions in cost modelling. 4. Our review highlights three weaknesses common in recent LCP analyses. First, LCP models typically rely on remotely sensed habitat maps, but few studies assess whether such maps are suitable proxies for factors affecting animal movement or consider the effects of adjacent habitats. Secondly, many studies use expert opinion to assign costs associated with landscape features, yet few validate these costs with empirical data or assess model sensitivity to errors in cost assignment. Thirdly, studies that consider multiple, alternative movement paths often propose width or length requirements for linkages without justification. 5. Synthesis and applications. LCP modelling and similar approaches to linkage design guide connectivity planning, yet often lack a biological or empirical foundation. Ecologists must clarify the biological processes on which resistance values are based, explicitly justify cost schemes and scale (grain) of analysis, evaluate the effects of landscape context and sensitivity to cost schemes, and strive to optimize cost schemes with empirical data. Research relating species' fine-grain habitat use to movement across broad extents is desperately needed, as are methods to determine biologically relevant length and width restrictions for linkages. 3aOvis canadensis 3aanimals 3aexpert opinion 3ahabitat fragmentation 3ahabitats 3alandscapes 3amodels 3aplanning 3aremote sensing1 aEpps, Clinton W.1 aBrashares, Justin S.0 tJournal of applied ecology.g2011 June, v. 48, no. 3 p.668-678dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0021-89017nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2011.01970.x 7aarticle02635naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002100164245010300185300001600288500002400304520136600328650001401694650001401708650001601722650001201738650001801750650001101768650001001779650002601789650001401815650001401829650002001843650001301863650001201876650001101888650000901899650002001908650002301928650002801951650002401979700002002003773008502023852000902108856004802117655001202165IND4432708920221118000402.0100213e201003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443270892DNAL7 a199603542pmid7 a10.1007/s00442-009-1518-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWilder, Shawn M.10aMales make poor meals: a comparison of nutrient extraction during sexual cannibalism and predation  ap. 617-625.  aIncludes references  aCannibalism is hypothesized to have evolved as a way to obtain a high-quality meal. We examined the extraction of lipid and protein by female wolf spiders, Hogna helluo, during sexual cannibalism of males and predation of crickets. Most food-limited females did not cannibalize males but immediately consumed a size-matched cricket. When consuming male H. helluo and crickets, female H. helluo only consumed 51% of the male body while they consumed 72% of the cricket body. While males had higher protein content in their bodies than crickets and other insects, female H. helluo ingested similar amounts of protein from male H. helluo and crickets. Female H. helluo extracted 47% of the protein present in male H. helluo and 67% of the protein present in crickets. Females were able to extract nearly all of the lipid present in male H. helluo and crickets. However, crickets and other insects had almost 4 times higher lipid content than male H. helluo. The ratio of lipid to protein consumed from crickets appeared more similar to the nutritional requirements of egg production than that of males. Taken together, female hesitancy to engage in cannibalism, low extraction of nutrients from males and a low ratio of lipid to protein in the food extracted from males suggest that males may be poor-quality prey items compared to common insects such as crickets. 3aGryllidae 3aLycosidae 3acannibalism 3afemales 3alipid content 3alipids 3amales 3anutrient requirements 3anutrients 3apredation 3aprotein sources 3aproteins 2aAnimals 2aFemale 2aMale 2aNutritive Value 2aPredatory Behavior 2aSexual Behavior, Animal 2aSpidersxphysiology1 aRypstra, Ann L.0 tOecologia.g2010 Mar., v. 162, no. 3 p.617-625dSpringer-Verlagx0029-85497nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-009-1518-3 7aarticle03370naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002800110040001800138100001200156245019200168300001800360520166400378650001302042650003702055650002102092650002302113650004502136650001202181650001902193650001502212650002302227650001202250650002302262650001602285650001302301650003602314650001802350650002502368650004702393650003602440650004602476700001902522700001602541700001802557700001502575700001602590773007602606852000902682856007802691930003302769945001302802946001302815655001202828IND2038186320221118000447.0940324e199310  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203818632DNAL7 a81054572pmid7 a10.3382/ps.07218232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUni, Z.10aMajor histocompatibility complex class IV restriction fragment length polymorphism markers in replicated meat-type chicken lines divergently selected for high or low early immune response  ap. 1823-1831.  aInformation on MHC may improve the efficiency of selection for immunological traits via the application of marker assisted selection or by selecting directly for a specific restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) band or MHC haplotype. An experimental procedure is presented here for identifying MHC genes that are related to early immune response. A Class IV cDNA clone was used to probe Southern blots of erythrocyte genomic DNA from chickens. Chickens were taken from the second (S2) and third (S3) generations of replicated lines divergently selected for high antibody response (HC1, HC2) or low antibody response (LC1, LC2) to Escherichia coli vaccination at 10 days of age. These selection criteria have been found to be associated with other immunological parameters. The hypothesis that these selected lines differ in their MHC loci was evaluated by comparing the frequencies of MHC RFLP markers (single RFLP bands) and haplotypes (patterns of RFLP bands). The significant differences between LC and HC in the frequency of many RFLP binds and of five MHC haplotypes indicate that early antibody production is influenced by MHC genes. The reliability of the association between the selection and frequency differences was tested and proven in most cases by analysis of the replicated lines. These differences in RFLP markers represent a change in allelic frequencies in MHC genes, probably due to selection. The results imply a connection between the Class IV genes and early antibody production, and they show the potential of prospective breeding not only by immunological phenotype but also by genotype (i.e., using RFLP markers of the MHC). 3achickens 3amajor histocompatibility complex 3aline differences 3aantibody formation 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3aalleles 3agene frequency 3ahaplotypes 3aselection response 2aAnimals 2aAntibody Formation 2aBiomarkers. 2aBreeding 2aChickensxgeneticsximmunology. 2aDNAxgenetics 2aHaplotypesxgenetics 2aMajor Histocompatibility Complexxgenetics 2aPolymorphism, Geneticxgenetics 2aPolymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length1 aGutman, Mario.1 aLeitner, G.1 aLandesman, E.1 aHeller, D.1 aCahaner, A.0 tPoultry science.g1993 Oct., v. 72, no. 10 p.1823-1831x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps.07218233Available from publisher's Web site  a19940415b19940418c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle02152naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002800110040001800138100001600156245006400172300001800236520074100254650000900995650002301004650001301027650002101040650001901061650001501080650001701095650001201112650005401124650004301178650002501221650002601246650002001272650002101292650003301313650001401346653002301360700001601383700001801399700001901417773007601436852000901512856007801521930003301599945001301632946001301645655001201658IND2038185220221117235958.0940324e199310  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203818522DNAL7 a84153582pmid7 a10.3382/ps.07218072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLarsson, A.10aChicken antibodies: taking advantage of evolution--a review  ap. 1807-1812.  aLaying hens are highly cost-effective as producers of antibodies compared with the mammals traditionally used for such production. Also, chicken antibodies have biochemical advantages over mammalian antibodies due to the phylogenetical differences between avian and mammalian species, resulting in increased sensitivity as well as decreased background in immunological assays. In contrast to mammalian antibodies, chicken antibodies do not activate the human complement system nor will they react with rheumatoid factors, human anti-mouse IgG antibodies, or bacterial and human Fc (fragment crystanizable)-receptors. Thus, chicken antibodies offer many advantages over mammalian antibodies and may replace such antibodies in the future. 3ahens 3aantibody formation 3aegg yolk 3aimmunoglobulin G 3across reaction 3acomplement 3aimmunoassays 2aAnimals 2aAntibodiesxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aAntibodies, Anti-Idiotypicximmunology 2aChickensximmunology 2aComplement Activation 2aCross Reactions 2aCryopreservation 2aImmunoglobulin Gximmunology 2aPhylogeny 0aliterature reviews1 aBalow, R.M.1 aLindahl, T.L.1 aForsberg, P.O.0 tPoultry science.g1993 Oct., v. 72, no. 10 p.1807-1812x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps.07218073Available from publisher's Web site  a19940415b19940418c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle02605naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120100001600138245011700154300001800271500001500289520153600304650002001840650002301860650001601883650003501899650002201934650002101956650001501977653000901992653002002001773007602021852000902097856007802106930003302184945001302217946001302230655001202243IND2038187620221118000304.0940324e199310  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203818762DNAL7 a10.3382/ps.07218412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarks, H.L.10aGrowth under different nutritonal environments following selection in Japanese quail under specific environments  ap. 1841-1846.  a2019-12-04  aA study was conducted to investigate growth in quail lines selected under three nutritional environments when lines were exposed to several environments. Lines utilized were the P line selected for high 4-wk BW under a 28% CP diet, the T line selected for high 4-wk BW under a 20% CP diet containing .2% thiouracil (TU), and the S line derived from the T line in Generation 27 and thereafter selected for high BW under a 28% CP diet containing .2% TU. The randombred control (C) from which these lines originated was also utilized. In Experiment 1, quail progeny from Generation 70 breeders were fed diets containing 28% CP with 0, .05, .10, .20, and .40% TU added to the diet. In Experiment 2, P, T, S, and C progeny from Generation 72 breeders were evaluated under the three selection environments. Body weights were obtained weekly from 0 to 4 wk. In Experiment 1, P line quail had superior BW on the control diet whereas S and T line quail had superior BW on diets containing TU. Increasing TU levels resulted in progressive decreases in P and C line BW, however, TU had only minimal effects on BW in S and T line quail, resulting in line by diet interactions. In Experiment 2, the highest BW was found in quail receiving the 28% CP diet, however, all selected lines had superior BW to other lines under their respective selection environments. Across diets, T line quail had the highest 4-wk BW and P line quail had the lowest BW. The best overall performance was obtained from the line selected under the poorest environment. 3adietary protein 3aselection response 3abody weight 3anutrition-genotype interaction 3aCoturnix japonica 3aline differences 3athiouracil 0adiet 0aJapanese quails0 tPoultry science.g1993 Oct., v. 72, no. 10 p.1841-1846x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps.07218413Available from publisher's Web site  a19940415b19940418c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle02813naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092024002200122024001900144040001800163100002000181245008600201300001800287500002400305506007600329520113700405506003701542650002501579650002201604650001201626650002101638650002401659650002601683650001401709650001901723650001101742650003001753650001201783650001401795650001501809650001301824650002501837650001801862650001901880650001201899700002201911700002701933700001901960700001901979773013601998852000902134856008002143856004802223655001202271IND4389134520221207130057.0070318e20070315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438913452DNAL7 a10.1128/AEM.00740-062doi7 aPMC18288342pmcid7 a172593682pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReeser, Ryan J.10aCharacterization of Campylobacter jejuni Biofilms under Defined Growth Conditions  ap. 1908-1913.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCampylobacter jejuni is a major cause of human diarrheal disease in many industrialized countries and is a source of public health and economic burden. C. jejuni, present as normal flora in the intestinal tract of commercial broiler chickens and other livestock, is probably the main source of human infections. The presence of C. jejuni in biofilms found in animal production watering systems may play a role in the colonization of these animals. We have determined that C. jejuni can form biofilms on a variety of abiotic surfaces commonly used in watering systems, such as acrylonitrile butadiene styrene and polyvinyl chloride plastics. Furthermore, C. jejuni biofilm formation was inhibited by growth in nutrient-rich media or high osmolarity, and thermophilic and microaerophilic conditions enhanced biofilm formation. Thus, nutritional and environmental conditions affect the formation of C. jejuni biofilms. Both flagella and quorum sensing appear to be required for maximal biofilm formation, as C. jejuni flaAB and luxS mutants were significantly reduced in their ability to form biofilms compared to the wild-type strain.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCampylobacter jejuni 3aanimal production 3abiofilm 3abroiler chickens 3adeveloped countries 3aenvironmental factors 3aflagellum 3ahuman diseases 3ahumans 3aintestinal microorganisms 3amutants 3anutrition 3aosmolarity 3aplastics 3apoly(vinyl chloride) 3apublic health 3aquorum sensing 3astyrene1 aMedler, Robert T.1 aBillington, Stephen J.1 aJost, B.

A homogeneous form of this enzyme was purified from Ralstonia sp. strain AJ110405, and the gene encoding the enzyme was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The enzyme appeared to be a homodimer consisting of identical subunits, and its molecular mass was found to be 47 kDa. It contained 0.7 to 0.8 mol of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate per mol of subunit and could catalyze the interconversion of α-methyl-L-serine to L-alanine and formaldehyde in the absence of tetrahydrofolate. Formaldehyde was generated from α-methyl-L-serine but not from α-methyl-D-serine, L-serine, or D-serine. α-Methyl-L-serine synthesis activity was detected when L-alanine was used as the substrate. In contrast, no activity was detected when D-alanine was used as the substrate. In the α-methyl-L-serine synthesis reaction, the enzymatic activity was inhibited by an excess amount of formaldehyde, which was one of the substrates. We used cells of E. coli as a whole-cell catalyst to express the gene encoding α-methylserine aldolase and effectively obtained a high yield of optically pure α-methyl-L-serine using L-alanine and formaldehyde.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBosea 3aEscherichia coli 3aRalstonia 3aVariovorax paradoxus 3aenzyme activity 3aformaldehyde 3afructose-bisphosphate aldolase 3agenes 3amolecular cloning 3amolecular weight1 aKuroda, Shinji1 aWatanabe, Kunihiko1 aYokozeki, Kenzo0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2008 Dec. 15, v. 74, no. 24 p.7596-7599dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.00677-083Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02983naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002500152245013200177300001600309500002400325520162500349650002001974650001901994650001102013650001602024650001302040650000902053650002802062650002402090650001902114650002402133650001702157650002402174650001902198650004802217650001102265650001602276650001602292700002902308700002402337773011202361852000902473856005502482655001202537IND4458917620221118000003.0110610e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445891762DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1745-4514.2010.00428.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCHEECHAROEN, JIRAWAN10aImprovement of physical properties of black tiger shrimp (penaeus monodon) meat gel induced by high pressure and heat treatment  ap. 976-996.  aIncludes references  aBreaking force and weight loss of the black tiger shrimp (Penaeus monodon) meat gel induced by pressure (600 MPa, 20 min, 28C) or pressure (400 MPa, 20 min, 28C) followed by heating (90C, 20 min) increased with the decrease in trichloroacetic acid-soluble peptide content when bovine plasma protein concentration (0-3% w/w) increased (P < 0.05). The gel prepared by pressure-heat treatment showed the higher breaking force but lower deformation than that prepared by only pressure (P < 0.05). The impact of microbial transglutaminase (MTGase, 0-2% w/w) and gelation conditions (setting, pressure, setting before/after pressure, setting and pressure followed by heating) on gel properties were also investigated. Breaking force and deformation increased with increasing MTGase concentration up to 0.15% (P < 0.05) mainly due to myosin heavy chain polymerization. The MTGase added gels prepared by pressure (400-600 MPa, 20 min, 28C) or combination with setting exhibited the greater breaking deformation than those induced by pressure-heat treatment (P < 0.05). PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: The production of gel product from shrimp meat or remainder, mostly small or broken shrimp, obtained from shrimp processing can lead to a new product with high market value. Due to the poor gel-forming ability of shrimp muscle protein, high pressure treatment in combination with bovine plasma protein or MTGase has been proven as a promising means to produce the gel with a unique appearance and improved textural properties. This finding indicates the feasibility for shrimp processing industry to maximize the utilization of shrimp. 3aPenaeus monodon 3ablood proteins 3acattle 3adeformation 3agelation 3agels 3ahigh pressure treatment 3ahigh-value products 3amuscle protein 3amyosin heavy chains 3anew products 3aphysical properties 3apolymerization 3aprotein-glutamine gamma-glutamyltransferase 3ashrimp 3ashrimp meat 3aweight loss1 aKIJROONGROJANA, KONGKARN1 aBENJAKUL, SOOTTAWAT0 tJournal of food biochemistry.g2011 June, v. 35, no. 3 p.976-996dBlackwell Publishing Incx0145-88847nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-4514.2010.00428.x 7aarticle03407naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002400171245009200195300001400287500002400301520151600325650001101841650002101852650002001873650001301893650001201906650001001918650001401928650002601942650001401968650002401982650000902006650002102015650001402036650001302050650002002063650001202083650008002095650002102175650001802196650003202214650001002246650001402256650002602270650005302296650006502349650005002414650005002464700001702514700001702531700001502548700001802563700001502581773013302596852000902729856005502738655001202793IND4447859920221118000106.0110125e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444785992DNAL7 a212193462pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-2885.2010.01195.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aINGVAST-LARSSON, C.10aPharmacokinetics of meloxicam in adult goats and its analgesic effect in disbudded kids  ap. 64-69.  aIncludes references  aIngvast-Larsson, C., Högberg, M., Mengistu, U., Olsén, L., Bondesson, U., Olsson, K. Pharmacokinetics of meloxicam in adult goats and its analgesic effect in disbudded kids. J. vet. Pharmacol. Therap.34, 64-69. The pharmacokinetics and analgesic effect of the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug meloxicam (0.5 mg/kg) in goats were investigated. In a randomized, cross-over design the pharmacokinetic parameters were investigated in adult goats (n = 8) after single intravenous and oral administration. The analgesic effect was evaluated in kids using a randomized, placebo controlled and blinded protocol. Kids received meloxicam (n = 6) once daily and their siblings (n = 5) got isotonic NaCl intramuscularly while still anaesthetized after cautery disbudding and injections were repeated on three consecutive days. In the adult goats after intravenous administration the terminal half-life was 10.9 ± 1.7 h, steady-state volume of distribution was 0.245 ± 0.06 L/kg, and total body clearance was 17.9 ± 4.3 mL/h/kg. After oral administration bioavailability was 79 ± 19%, Cmax was 736 ± 184 ng/mL, Tmax was 15 ±5 h, although the terminal half-life was similar to the intravenous value, 11.8 ± 1.7 h. Signs of pain using a visual analogue scale were smaller in kids treated with meloxicam compared with kids treated with placebo on the first day after disbudding, but subsequently no difference in pain was noticeable. Plasma cortisol and glucose concentrations did not differ between the two groups. 3aadults 3aanalgesic effect 3abioavailability 3acortisol 3aglucose 3agoats 3ahalf life 3aintravenous injection 3ameloxicam 3aoral administration 3apain 3apharmacokinetics 3apotassium 3asiblings 3asodium chloride 2aAnimals 2aAnti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidalxpharmacokineticsxtherapeutic use. 2aArea Under Curve 2aBlood Glucose 2aGoat Diseasesxdrug therapy 2aGoats 2aHalf-Life 2aHydrocortisonexblood 2aPainxbloodxdrug therapyxetiologyxveterinary. 2aSurgical Procedures, Operativexadverse effectsxveterinary. 2aThiazinesxpharmacokineticsxtherapeutic use. 2aThiazolesxpharmacokineticsxtherapeutic use.1 aHÖGBERG, M.1 aMENGISTU, U.1 aOLSÉN, L.1 aBONDESSON, U.1 aOLSSON, K.0 tJournal of veterinary pharmacology and therapeutics.g2011 Feb., v. 34, no. 1 p.64-69dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0140-77837nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2885.2010.01195.x 7aarticle02916naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002500164245006800189300001600257500002400273520161800297650001701915650002001932650001501952650002901967650001501996650002202011650001202033650001702045650001202062650001502074650003802089650002902127650002502156650001602181650001102197650001802208651001402226651001802240651001402258651001802272773009902290852000902389856004802398655001202446IND4403991520221118000754.0080404e200804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440399152DNAL7 a182280892pmid7 a10.1007/s00267-008-9067-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMargerum, Richard D.12aA Typology of Collaboration Efforts in Environmental Management  ap. 487-500.  aIncludes references  aCollaboration involves stakeholders and the public in a process of consensus building to address some of the most difficult environmental management problems facing society today. Collaborative groups vary widely, ranging from small watershed councils to regional ecosystem collaboratives to groups addressing large-scale policy issues. While these collaboratives all match the common principles of collaboration, a closer examination reveals many differences. Using institutional theories about levels of decision making provides a way of classifying collaboratives along a spectrum from action level to organizational level to policy level. This typology is applied to thirty-six collaboration case studies in Australia and the United States that were investigated over a series of years through interviews, observation, document analysis, and surveys. The application reveals different tendencies among the case types in terms of population, size, problem significance, institutional setting, and focus of activities. The typology also reveals functional differences in the types of stakeholders involved, the management arrangements for implementation, and the approaches to implementing change. This typology can help practitioners better understand the challenges and appropriate types of collaborations for different settings. It helps highlight differences in the role of government and decentralization of power. It distinguishes the different theoretical foundations for different types of collaboratives. Finally, it elucidates the different evaluation approaches for different types of collaboratives. 3acase studies 3adecision making 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental management 3ainterviews 3aissues and policy 3asociety 3astakeholders 3asurveys 3awatersheds 2aCommunity-Institutional Relations 2aCommunity Participation. 2aCooperative Behavior 2aEnvironment 2aHumans 2aPublic Policy 3aAustralia 3aUnited States 0aAustralia 0aUnited States0 tEnvironmental management.g2008 Apr., v. 41, no. 4 p.487-500dSpringer-Verlagx0364-152X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00267-008-9067-9 7aarticle02644naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001700171245005500188300001600243500002400259520137500283650001501658650001801673650001701691650003101708650001701739650002001756650001401776650001201790650003001802650001801832650002301850650003101873650004001904650002401944700001801968700002101986700001802007773012102025852000902146856005502155655001202210IND4458963020221118000448.0110610e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445896302DNAL7 a215545372pmid7 a10.1111/j.1744-7909.2011.01044.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Jianjun10aAbscisic Acid Receptors: Past, Present and FutureF  ap. 469-479.  aIncludes references  aJin-Gui Chen(Corresponding author) Abscisic acid (ABA) is the key plant stress hormone. Consistent with the earlier studies in support of the presence of both membrane- and cytoplasm-localized ABA receptors, recent studies have identified multiple ABA receptors located in various subcellular locations. These include a chloroplast envelope-localized receptor (the H subunit of Chloroplast Mg²⁺-chelatase/ABA Receptor), two plasma membrane-localized receptors (G-protein Coupled Receptor 2 and GPCR-type G proteins), and one cytosol/nucleus-localized Pyrabactin Resistant (PYR)/PYR-Like (PYL)/Regulatory Component of ABA Receptor 1 (RCAR). Although the downstream molecular events for most of the identified ABA receptors are currently unknown, one of them, PYR/PYL/RCAR was found to directly bind and regulate the activity of a long-known central regulator of ABA signaling, the A-group protein phosphatase 2C (PP2C). Together with the Sucrose Non-fermentation Kinase Subfamily 2 (SnRK2s) protein kinases, a central signaling complex (ABA-PYR-PP2Cs-SnRK2s) that is responsible for ABA signal perception and transduction is supported by abundant genetic, physiological, biochemical and structural evidence. The identification of multiple ABA receptors has advanced our understanding of ABA signal perception and transduction while adding an extra layer of complexity. 3aG-proteins 3aabscisic acid 3achloroplasts 3aphosphoprotein phosphatase 3aplant stress 3aprotein kinases 3areceptors 3asucrose 2aAbscisic Acidxmetabolism 2aBinding Sites 2aModels, Biological 2aPlant Proteinsxmetabolism 2aReceptors, Cell Surfacexmetabolism 2aSignal Transduction1 aYang, Xiaohan1 aWeston, David J.1 aChen, Jin-Gui0 tJournal of integrative plant biology.g2011 June, v. 53, no. 6 p.469-479dBlackwell Publishing Asiax1672-90727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1744-7909.2011.01044.x 7aarticle02346naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002200145245013900167300001800306500002400324520129600348650002501644650001401669650001401683650001101697650001701708650001301725700002201738700002001760700002201780700001901802773013001821852000901951856004801960655001202008IND4393936420221118000610.0070812e199709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439393642DNAL7 a10.1007/s11746-997-0028-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarlow, Stuart M.10aCollaborative test of determination of iodine value in fish oils. 1. Reaction time and carbon tetrachloride or cyclohexane as solvents  ap. 1077-1083.  aIncludes references  aTwenty-two laboratories participated in a collaborative test to determine the iodine value (IV) of eight samples of fish oil (four with IV<150, four with IV>150) with either carbon tetrachloride (AOCS Official Method Cd 1-25) or cyclohexane (AOCS Recommended Practice Cd 1b-87) as solvent and either 1 or 2 h of reaction time. Laboratories received coded duplicate samples (hidden duplicates) and carried out duplicate determinations on each oil by each solvent-time combination (open duplicates). Replacing carbon tetrachloride with cyclohexane resulted in a lower IV (P<0.001). The decrease averaged 1.6 IV units for low-IV oils and 3.8 IV units for high-IV oils; this difference in response of 2.2 IV units between low- and high-IV oils was significant (P<0.001). Increasing the reaction time had a relatively small effect (0.34±0.18). There was no interaction of reaction time with solvent or oil type. Cyclohexane caused emulsions, which made it difficult to titrate residual iodine and thus increased the variability of the determination. The repeatability standard deviations (s r ), based on hidden duplicates, for 1-h reaction time with carbon tetrachloride and cyclohexane were 2.17 and 3.35, respectively. The corresponding reproducibility standard deviations were 2.73 and 4.53. 3acarbon tetrachloride 3aemulsions 3afish oils 3aiodine 3aiodine value 3asolvents1 aBimbo, Anthony P.1 aMiller, Eric L.1 aThorisson, Snorri1 aWalters, D.

Oxidation of 8a and Se-methylselenocysteine (6a) gives methaneseleninic acid (24), characterized by X-ray crystallography, and dimethyl diselenide (25). Oxidation of Se-2-propenyl-L-selenocysteine (6c) gives allyl alcohol and 3-seleninoalanine (22). Compound 22 is also formed on oxidation of 16 and selenocystine (4). Oxidation of 6d gives 2-[(E,Z)-1-propenylseleno]-propanal (36). These oxidations occur by way of selenoxides, detected by chromatographic and spectroscopic methods. The natural occurrence of many of the Se-alk(en)ylselenocysteines and their gamma-glutamyl derivatives and oxidation products is discussed. Three homologues of the potent cancer chemoprevention agents 6a and 6c, namely 6d-f, were evaluated for effects on cell growth, induction of apoptosis, and DNA-damaging activity using two murine mammary epithelial cell lines. Although each compound displays a unique profile of activity, none of these compounds (6d-f) is likely to exceed the chemopreventive efficacy of selenocysteine Se-conjugates 6a and 6c. 3aorganic compounds 3aselenium 3asynthesis 3aantineoplastic agents 3aAllium 3aoxidation 3aspectral analysis 3achemical constituents of plants 3aoxides 3achemical structure 2aAlliumxchemistry 2aAnimals 2aAnticarcinogenic Agentsxpharmacology 2aApoptosisxdrug effects 2aCell Divisionxdrug effects 2aCell Line 2aCrystallography, X-Ray 2aEpithelial Cellsxcytologyxdrug effects. 2aFemale 2aMammary Glands, Animalxcytologyxdrug effects. 2aMice 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aSelenocysteinexanalogs & derivativesxanalysisxchemistryxpharmacology. 0achemistry 0aorganoselenium compounds1 aBirringer, M.1 aJiang, W.1 aNakahodo, T.1 aThompson, H.J.1 aToscano, P.J.1 aUzar, H.1 aZhang, X.1 aZhu, Z.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2001 Jan., v. 49, no. 1 p.458-470x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf001097b3Available from publisher's Web site  a20020501b20020507c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle02162naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100001400156245006200170300001600232520071600248650001100964650002600975650002101001650001201022650001901034650002101053650002701074650003601101650002601137650006301163650002301226650004101249650005501290651001001345651001001355653002201365700001601387700001701403700001501420773010001435852000901535856007701544930003301621945001301654946001301667655001201680IND2325719620221118000536.0020228e200101  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232571962DNAL7 a111706202pmid7 a10.1021/jf000865w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiele, M.10aMethyleugenol in Ocimum basilicum L. cv.

The aromatic composition of plants at different growth stages was determined. Plants from different areas of northwestern Italy were analyzed at 4 and 6 weeks after sowing and showed methyleugenol and eugenol as the main components. The content of these compounds was correlated with plant height rather than plant age. Particularly, methyleugenol was predominant in plants up to 10 cm in height, whereas eugenol was prevalent in taller plants. These results are important in the evaluation of risk to human health posed by dietary ingestion of methyleugenol contained in pesto. 3aheight 3aplant characteristics 3aOcimum basilicum 3aeugenol 3amethyl eugenol 3aflavor compounds 3ageographical variation 3achemical constituents of plants 2aCarcinogensxanalysis 2aEugenolxadverse effectsxanalogs & derivativesxanalysis. 2aFood Contamination 2aGas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry 2aOcimum basilicumxchemistryxgrowth & development. 3aItaly 0aItaly 0acrop growth stage1 aDondero, R.1 aCiarallo, G.1 aMazzei, M.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2001 Jan., v. 49, no. 1 p.517-521x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf000865w3Available from publisher's Web site  a20020501b20020507c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle03089naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100001800156245010900174300001600283500001500299520160300314650001601917650002801933650001201961650001901973650001701992650001402009650002102023650003602044650002402080650002102104650002502125650002102150650002402171650002402195650003502219653002402254653003502278653002002313700001702333773010002350852000902450856007702459930003302536945001302569946001302582655001202595IND2325710120221118000527.0020228e200101  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232571012DNAL7 a111705982pmid7 a10.1021/jf00067292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGoffman, F.D.10aGamma-linolenic acid and tocopherol contents in the seed oil of 47 accessions from several Ribes species  ap. 349-354.  a2019-12-04  aGamma-linolenic acid is an essential fatty acid for humans with delta-6-desaturase deficiency; it is a precursor of prostaglandins, prostacyclins, and tromboxanes; and it has antiinflammatory and antitumoral effects. Tocopherols are natural antioxidants with biological activity, heart/vascular, and cancer protective properties. The oil, gamma-linolenic acid, and tocopherol contents, as well as tocopherol composition, were investigated in the seed oil of a collection of 47 accessions belonging to various species of the genus Ribes. Differences for oil content among species were not significant. The highest total tocopherol content was found in R. nigrum (mean, 1716 mg kg(-1) oil), followed by R. rubrum (mean, 1442 mg kg(-1) oil). R. grossularia showed the lowest values for this trait (mean, 786 mg kg(-1) oil). The three species also differed strongly for tocopherol composition. R. rubrum was distinguished by a higher concentration of delta-tocopherol (mean, 20.2%); R. grossularia displayed the highest percentage of gamma-tocopherol (mean, 70.0%), and R. nigrum showed the highest concentration for alpha-tocopherol (mean, 34.8%), the most biologically active among the four tocopherols. Regarding gamma-linolenic acid, the highest content was found in R. nigrum, which exhibited up to 15.8% of this essential fatty acid in the oil. R. grossularia and R. rubrum showed mean gamma-linolenic acid contents of 8% and 6.2%, respectively. The present study indicated that seeds of Ribes species, especially R. nigrum, could be used as sources of gamma-linolenic acid and natural vitamin E. 3atocopherols 3ainterspecific variation 3ahybrids 3alinolenic acid 3aRibes nigrum 3aseed oils 3aRibes uva-crispa 3achemical constituents of plants 2aChromatography, Gas 2aFruitxchemistry 2aPlant Oilsxanalysis 2aSeedsxchemistry 2aSpecies Specificity 2aVitamin Exanalysis 2agamma-Linolenic Acidxanalysis 0aspecies differences 0aribes nigrum x ribes hirtellum 0aribes hirtellum1 aGalletti, S.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2001 Jan., v. 49, no. 1 p.349-354x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf00067293Available from publisher's Web site  a20020501b20020507c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle02139naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100001500156245010300171300001800274520075000292650002001042650002301062650002501085650002301110650001601133650002301149650002201172650001601194650004101210650003301251650001201284650004101296651001001337651001001347700001501357700001501372700001701387700001801404773010201422852000901524856007701533930003301610945001301643946001301656655001201669IND2326215820221118000222.0020326e200108  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232621582DNAL7 a115136772pmid7 a10.1021/jf010025x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTanabe, A.10aSeasonal and spatial studies on pesticide residues in surface waters of the Shinano River in Japan  ap. 3847-3852.  aWater samples collected once a week from early April 1996 to the end of August 1996 from four sites on the Shinano River in Japan were analyzed for pesticides and their metabolites using a gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer.

Tennesse 86). Plants were grown under controlled conditions and submitted to regular fertilization with macro- and micronutrients. The CaCl2 was applied to the nutrient solution at 1.25 mM (T1), 2.5 mM (T2), and 5 mM (T3). The results indicated that, under the experimental conditions of this work, the application of 1.25 mM of CaCl2 favored the growth and development of the leaves, this leading to improved biomass production in tobacco leaves. The increase in foliar biomass in treatment T1 could largely be a result of the stimulation of NO3(-) assimilation. However, this situation has negative consequences for tobacco quality, given that the T1 treatment augmented the NO3(-) concentration and the foliar concentration of nicotine (both effects being harmful for human consumption) and decreased the concentration of reducing sugars in leaves of tobacco plants compared with those of T2 and T3. Finally, a close and directly proportional relationship was found in our experiment between the parameters of foliar-biomass production, total N concentration, chlorophyll concentration, and decline in quality. 3acalcium chloride 3aplant development 3anitrogen metabolism 3anitrogen content 3acrop quality 3aapplication rate 3anicotine 3acalcium 3aNicotiana tabacum 3achemical constituents of plants 3abiomass 3aanabasine 3aleaves 3ainorganic ions 2aBiomass 2aCalcium Chloridexadverse effectsxpharmacology. 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aPlant Leaves 2aPlants, Toxic 2aQuality Control 2aTobaccoxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 0apyridine alkaloids 0aanatabine 0achlorides 0agrowth1 aRomero, L.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2001 Aug., v. 49, no. 8 p.3600-3605x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf010083i3Available from publisher's Web site  a20020501b20020507c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02360naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100001900137245017500156300001800331520112300349650001901472650002701491650001001518650003001528650000801558650002201566650001401588650001001602650002301612650001601635700001201651700001501663700001301678700001201691773010201703852000901805856007701814930003301891945001301924946001301937655001201950IND2326210620221117235937.0020326e200108  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232621062DNAL7 a10.1021/jf010173n2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHernández, M.12aA rapeseed-specific gene, Aetyl-CoA carboxylase, can be used as a reference for qualitative and real-time quantitative PCR detection of transgenes from mixed food samples  ap. 3622-3627.  aPolymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods are very useful techniques for the detection and quantification of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in food samples. These methods rely on the amplification of transgenic sequences and quantification of the transgenic DNA by comparison to an amplified reference gene. Reported here is the development of specific primers for the rapeseed (Brassica napus) BnACCg8 gene and PCR cycling conditions suitable for the use of this sequence as an endogenous reference gene in both qualitative and quantitative PCR assays. Both methods were assayed with 20 different rapeseed varieties, and identical amplification products were obtained with all of them. No amplification products were observed when DNA samples from other Brassica species, Arabidopsis thaliana, maize, and soybean were used as templates, which demonstrates that this system is specific for rapeseed. In real-time quantitative PCR analysis, the detection limit was as low as 1.25 pg of DNA, which indicates that this method is suitable for use in processed food samples which contain very low copies of target DNA. 3aBrassica napus 3aacetyl-CoA carboxylase 3agenes 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aDNA 3atransgenic plants 3adetection 3afoods 3afood contamination 3aDNA primers1 aRio, A.1 aEsteve, T.1 aPrat, S.1 aPla, M.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2001 Aug., v. 49, no. 8 p.3622-3627x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf010173n3Available from publisher's Web site  a20020501b20020507c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02728naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100001600156245012400172300001800296500001500314520138500329650001601714650001101730650001301741650002201754650001401776650001901790650001901809650001701828650001701845650001401862650001901876650002601895650002701921650001001948653001801958700001401976700002101990773010202011852000902113856007702122930003302199945001302232946001302245655001202258IND2326210920221117235920.0020326e200108  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232621092DNAL7 a115136412pmid7 a10.1021/jf001297n2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeyer, A.S.10aEfficiency of enzymatic and other alternative clarification and fining treatments on turbidity and haze in cherry juice  ap. 3644-3650.  a2019-12-04  aSeveral alternative strategies were examined for improving conventional juice fining procedures for cherry juice clarification and fining in laboratory-scale experiments: Centrifugation of freshly pressed juice from 1000g to 35000g induced decreased turbidity according to a steep, negative power function. Individual and interactive effects on turbidity and haze formation in precentrifuged and uncentrifuged cherry juice of treatments with pectinase, acid protease, bromelain, gallic acid, and gelatin-silica sol were investigated in a factorial experimental design with 32 different parameter combinations. Gelatin-silica sol consistently had the best effect on juice clarity. Centrifugation of cherry juice (10000g for 15 min) prior to clarification treatment significantly improved juice clarity and diminished the rate of haze formation during cold storage of juice. Both treatment of precentrifuged cherry juice with Novozym 89L protease and co-addition of pectinase and gallic acid improved cherry juice clarity and diminished haze levels. None of the alternative treatments produced the unwieldy colloids notorious to gelatin-silica sol treatment. The data suggest that several alternative clarification strategies deserve further consideration in large-scale cherry juice processing. Precentrifugation of juice before clarification and fining is immediately recommended. 3agallic acid 3asilica 3acherries 3apolygalacturonase 3aturbidity 3aPrunus cerasus 3acentrifugation 3acold storage 3afruit juices 2aBeverages 2aCentrifugation 2aEnzymesxpharmacology 2aFood Handlingxmethods 2aFruit 0aclarification1 aKoser, C.1 aAdler-Nissen, J.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2001 Aug., v. 49, no. 8 p.3644-3650x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf001297n3Available from publisher's Web site  a20020501b20020507c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03009naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100001700156245013300173300001800306500001500324520124700339650001601586650001501602650001801617650001701635650001701652650002001669650001501689650002501704650001401729650001901743650000901762650001401771650004101785650007901826650005401905650002701959650001001986650001701996653001702013653001702030653001402047653002302061653001602084653001502100653001502115700001702130700002502147773010202172852000902274856007702283930003302360945001302393946001302406655001202419IND2326211020221118000154.0020326e200108  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232621102DNAL7 a115136422pmid7 a10.1021/jf010192x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZafrilla, P.10aEffect of processing and storage on the antioxidant ellagic acid derivatives and flavonoids of red raspberry (Rubus idaeus) jams  ap. 3651-3655.  a2019-12-04  aFrom red raspberries, ellagic acid, its 4-arabinoside, its 4' (4"-acetyl) arabinoside, and its 4' (4"-acetyl)xyloside, as well as quercetin and kaempferol 3-glucosides, were identified. In addition, two unidentified ellagic acid derivatives were detected. The free radical scavenging activity of the ellagic acid derivatives was evaluated by using the DPPH method and compared to that of Trolox. All of the isolated compounds showed antioxidant activity. The effect of processing to obtain jams on raspberry phenolics was evaluated. The flavonol content decreased slightly with processing and more markedly during storage of the jams. The ellagic acid derivatives, with the exception of ellagic acid itself, remained quite stable with processing and during 6 months of jam storage. The content of free ellagic acid increased 3-fold during the storage period. The initial content (10 mg/kg of fresh weight of raspberries) increased 2-fold with processing, and it continued increasing up to 35 mg/kg after 1 month of storage of the jam. Then a slight decrease was observed until 6 months of storage had elapsed. The increase observed in ellagic acid could be explained by a release of ellagic acid from ellagitannins with the thermal treatment. 3araspberries 3akaempferol 3afree radicals 3afood storage 3aellagic acid 3afood processing 3aglucosides 3aantioxidant activity 3aoxidation 3aheat treatment 3ajams 3aquercetin 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquid 2aEllagic Acidxanalogs & derivativesxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aFlavonoidsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aFood Handlingxmethods 2aFruit 2aTime Factors 0adpph radical 0aarabinosides 0axylosides 0achemical reactions 0aderivatives 0ainhibition 0aglycosides1 aFerreres, F.1 aTomas-Barberan, F.A.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2001 Aug., v. 49, no. 8 p.3651-3655x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf010192x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20020501b20020507c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02462naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100001400156245009200170300001800262520100400280650002301284650001601307650002101323650001901344650002201363650001301385650000901398650002701407650001501434650002401449650000901473650002001482650003101502650002101533650003301554650001001587653001101597653002001608653002201628700001601650700001601666700001501682773010201697852000901799856007701808930003301885945001301918946001301931655001201944IND2326223920221118000413.0020327e200108  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232622392DNAL7 a115136952pmid7 a10.1021/jf001460e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHanda, A.10aCorrelation of the protein structure and gelling properties in dried egg white products  ap. 3957-3964.  aThe relationship between protein structure and aggregation, as well as heat-induced gelling properties, of seven dried egg white (DEW) products was investigated. Strong correlations were found between average molecular weight and hydrophobicity plus surface SH groups of DEW-soluble protein aggregate (SPA). This suggests that hydrophobic interactions and disulfide bond formation between protein molecules were involved in the aggregation. The average molecular weight of DEW products with alkaline pHs was relatively higher than those with neutral pHs and the same degree of protein unfolding, probably because of more disulfide bond formation between protein molecules. In addition, strong correlations were found between hydrophobicity, surface SH groups plus average molecular weight of DEW-SPA, and physical properties of the gels from DEW products. These data indicated that controlling the aggregation of DEW proteins in the dry state is crucial to controlling the gelling properties of DEW. 3aprotein aggregates 3aegg albumen 3amolecular weight 3ahydrophobicity 3asulfhydryl groups 3agelation 3agels 3awater holding capacity 3adried eggs 2aEgg Whitexanalysis 2aGels 2aHot Temperature 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aMolecular Weight 2aProtein Structure, Secondary 2aWater 0astrain 0abreaking stress 0abreaking strength1 aHayashi, K.1 aShidara, H.1 aKuroda, N.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2001 Aug., v. 49, no. 8 p.3957-3964x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf001460e3Available from publisher's Web site  a20020501b20020507c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02502naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100001800156245009000174300001800264520113800282650001801420650001401438650002301452650001101475650001701486650002501503650004401528650004501572650003701617650002401654650003901678650002701717653001401744653001701758700001501775700001901790773010201809852000901911856007701920930003301997945001302030946001302043655001202056IND2326223120221118000007.0020327e200108  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232622312DNAL7 a115136922pmid7 a10.1021/jf010193p2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSilva, F.A.M.10aEffects of phenolic propyl esters on the oxidative stability of refined sunflower oil  ap. 3936-3941.  aThe oxidative stability of refined sunflower oil in the presence and in the absence of propyl caffeate (PC), propyl hydrocaffeate (PHC), propyl ferulate (PF), and propyl isoferulate (PI) has been evaluated according to the Rancimat method. The antioxidant activity of the phenolic derivatives was compared with that obtained with native [alpha-tocopherol (alpha-TOH)] and synthetic [propyl gallate (PG)] antioxidants. The results allow the establishment of a decreasing order of antioxidant power: PG > PHC > PC >> alpha-TOH > PI > PF. The oxidative stability was improved neither by the addition of PF nor by a supplement of alpha-TOH. Moreover, a positive antioxidant effect was obtained for PC that was placed between those of alpha-TOH and PG. The antioxidant activity of PHC was higher than that of its analogue (PC). A dose-dependent effect was observed for PG, PHC, and PC. A chain-breaking mechanism was proposed for the antioxidant activity of propyl phenolic esters because the same ranking order of efficacy was obtained for their antiradical activities evaluated by using the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical method. 3asunflower oil 3aoxidation 3aphenolic compounds 3aesters 3aantioxidants 3aantioxidant activity 2aAntioxidantsxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aCaffeic Acidsxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aPhenolsxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aPlant Oilsxmetabolism 0astability 0adpph radical1 aBorges, F.1 aFerreira, M.A.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2001 Aug., v. 49, no. 8 p.3936-3941x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf010193p3Available from publisher's Web site  a20020501b20020507c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02694naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100001400156245008400170300001800254500001500272520120400287650002101491650002101512650003401533650002001567650001101587650002501598650006201623650002401685650004001709650003101749650001301780650004601793650002101839650001601860653001701876653003601893653002101929700001501950773010201965852000902067856007702076930003302153945001302186946001302199655001202212IND2326222720221118000706.0020327e200108  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232622272DNAL7 a115136902pmid7 a10.1021/jf000694v2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNagai, T.10aPartial purification of polyphenol oxidase from Chinese cabbage Brassica rapa L  ap. 3922-3926.  a2019-12-04  aPolyphenol oxidase (PPO) was purified and characterized from Chinese cabbage by ammonium sulfate precipitation and DEAE-Toyopearl 650M column chromatography. Substrate staining of the crude protein extract showed the presence of three isozymic forms of this enzyme. The molecular weight of the purified enzyme was estimated to be approximately 65 kDa by gel filtration on Toyopearl HW-55F. On SDS-PAGE analysis, this enzyme was composed of a subunit molecular weight of 65 kDa. The optimum pH was 5.0, and this enzyme was stable at pH 6.0 but was unstable below pH 4.0 or above pH 7.0. The optimum temperature was 40 degrees C. Heat inactivation studies showed temperatures >40 degrees C resulted in loss of enzyme activity. PPO showed activity to catechol, pyrogallol, and dopamine (K(m) and V(max) values were 682.5 mM and 67.6 OD/min for catechol, 15.4 mM and 14.1 OD/min for pyrogallol, and 62.0 mM and 14.9 OD/min for dopamine, respectively). The most effective inhibitor was 2-mercaptoethanol, followed in decreasing order by ascorbic acid, glutathione, and L-cysteine. The enzyme activity of the preparation was maintained for 2 days at 4 degrees C but showed a sudden decreased after 3 days. 3acatechol oxidase 3amolecular weight 3aBrassica rapa subsp. oleifera 3aenzyme activity 3aleaves 2aBrassicaxenzymology 2aCatechol Oxidasexdrug effectsxisolation & purification. 2aChromatography, Gel 2aElectrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aKinetics 2aMercaptoethanolxantagonists & inhibitors 2aMolecular Weight 2aTemperature 0apurification 0aBrassica rapa subsp. campestris 0achinese cabbages1 aSuzuki, N.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2001 Aug., v. 49, no. 8 p.3922-3926x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf000694v3Available from publisher's Web site  a20020501b20020507c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle04099naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002800110040001800138100001100156245016900167300001600336520202400352650002102376650001902397650001502416650001202431650001602443650002002459650001802479650001802497650000902515650001702524650005402541650001202595650005302607650006002660650003302720650002602753650002002779650001802799650000902817650002302826650005402849650005602903650005702959650002203016650003703038650002803075650003703103653001103140653001303151653001203164700001903176700001803195700001703213773007303230852000903303856007803312930003303390945001303423946001303436655001203449IND2052758020221117235132.0960826e199602  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205275802DNAL7 a88333772pmid7 a10.3382/ps.07502402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYi, Z.10aImproving phytate phosphorus availability in corn and soybean meal for broilers using microbial phytase and calculation of phosphorus equivalency values for phytase  ap. 240-249.  aTwo experiments were conducted to determine the effectiveness of Natuphos phytase for improving P availability of soybean meal-based semi-purified diets (SP, Experiments 1 and 2) and corn-soybean meal-based diets (CS, Experiment 2) fed to broilers (1 to 21 d). There were 360 and 288 birds fed the SP diets in Experiments 1 and 2, respectively, and 288 birds were fed the CS diets in Experiment 2. Phosphorus equivalency values for phytase were calculated. The basal diets were formulated to contain 0.27% nonphytate P (nP); the SP basal diet contained 0.45% total P (tP) that included 0.17% P as defluorinated phosphate; the CS basal diet contained 0.51% tP that contained 0.12% P as defluorinated phosphate. Both basal diets were supplemented with defluorinated phosphate to provide 0.36, 0.45, or 0.54% nP or with 350, 700, or 1,050 U of phytase/kg diets. Supplementing defluorinated phosphate and phytase linearly increased BW gain (P < 0.001), feed intake (P < 0.001), and percentage ash of dried toes (P < 0.01). Phytase addition increased apparent retention of P (P < 0.02), Ca (P < 0.005 in Experiment 2), and N (P < 0.06 in Experiment 2 for CS), increased apparent digestibility of DM (P < 0.04), and linearly decreased (P < 0.005) P excretion. In comparison to the 0.45% nP diet, P excretion was reduced 42 to 51% by addition of phytase. The addition of defluorinated phosphate linearly decreased apparent retention of P (P < 0.02) and Ca (P < 0.005 in Experiment 2), and increased P excretion (P < 0.007). The average of released P by phytase calculated by solving nonlinear or linear response equations of P and phytase levels for SP diets in Experiments 1 and 2 gave a P equivalency value of 1 g P = 1,146 U of phytase. The P equivalency value for CS diets fed only in Experiment 2 was 785 U of phytase = 1 g P as defluorinated phosphate. These studies show that microbial phytase is effective for improving P availability and for decreasing P excretion. Added phytase can also increase Ca and N retention. 3abroiler chickens 3afeed additives 3aphosphorus 3acalcium 3aphytic acid 3aliveweight gain 3adose response 3adigestibility 3acorn 3asoybean meal 2a6-Phytasexadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aAnimals 2aCalciumxanalysisxmetabolismxpharmacokinetics. 2aChickensxgrowth & developmentxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aDietxstandardsxveterinary. 2aDigestionxphysiology 2aFood, Fortified 2aLinear Models 2aMale 2aModels, Biological 2aNitrogenxanalysisxmetabolismxpharmacokinetics. 2aPhosphorusxanalysisxmetabolismxpharmacokinetics. 2aPhytic Acidxanalysisxmetabolismxpharmacokinetics. 2aRandom Allocation 2aSoybeansxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aWeight Gainxphysiology 2aZea maysxchemistryxmetabolism. 0adigits 0abone ash 0aphytase1 aKornegay, E.T.1 aRavindran, V.1 aDenbow, D.M.0 tPoultry science.g1996 Feb., v. 75, no. 2 p.240-249x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps.07502403Available from publisher's Web site  a19961002b19961007c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle03620naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002800110040001800138100002000156245008700176300001600263500001500279520179100294650001102085650002002096650002002116650002102136650001902157650002002176650001602196650001802212650001102230650001702241650001602258650003802274650001202312650002802324650006002352650003302412650002602445650001102471650004702482650002002529650005202549650002302601650000902624650002402633650004802657650001702705650002802722653001902750700001802769773007302787852000902860856007802869930003302947945001302980946001302993655001203006IND2052757520221117235229.0960826e199602  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205275752DNAL7 a88333752pmid7 a10.3382/ps.07502242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFernandez, S.R.10aBioavailability of digestible lysine in heat-damaged soybean meal for chick growth  ap. 224-231.  a2019-12-04  aPrevious experiments indicated that true digestible Lys values for soybean and cottonseed meals obtained with the precision-fed cecectomized rooster assay were accurate estimators of Lys bioavailability for chick growth. This study was conducted to determine whether the digestible Lys in overheated soybean meal (SBM) was totally bioavailable for protein synthesis. Soybean meal alone or mixed with dextrose (SBM: dextrose ratio = 3:1) was autoclaved at 114 C and 97 kPa for 0 to 60 min. True digestibility of Lys in SBM was determined using the precision-fed cecectomized rooster assay. Bioavailability was then assessed by chick growth assay using purified crystalline amino acid diets deficient in Lys that were supplemented with varying levels of crystalline L-Lys.Cl or a SBM. Multiple regression slope-ratio methodology indicated that the digestible Lys in unautoclaved SBM was 100% bioavailable. For SBM autoclaved for 40 or 60 min and SBM-dextrose autoclaved for 20 min, bioavailability of digestible Lys based on weight gain or carcass Lys gain was 81 to 87% and significantly less (P < 0.05) than 100%, whereas bioavailability values based on feed efficiency and carcass N gain did not differ (P > 0.05) from 100%. Bioavailability values for digestible Lys in SBM:dextrose autoclaved for 30 min ranged from 55 to 73% for all performance criteria. Partitioning the response criteria, so that only the response to the supplemental Lys source (not the basal diet) was being evaluated, increased the bioavailability values for all treatments except SBM: dextrose autoclaved for 30 min. The results of this study indicated that digestible Lys in severely heat-damaged SBM measured by the precision-fed cecectomized rooster assay was not totally bioavailable for protein synthesis. 3alysine 3abioavailability 3afeed conversion 3afeed supplements 3ameat carcasses 3aliveweight gain 3afeed intake 3adigestibility 3achicks 3asoybean meal 3aautoclaving 2aAnimal Feedxanalysisxstandards. 2aAnimals 2aBiological Availability 2aChickensxgrowth & developmentxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aDietxstandardsxveterinary. 2aDigestionxphysiology 2aFemale 2aGlucosexchemistryxmetabolismxstandards. 2aHot Temperature 2aLysinexanalysisxmetabolismxpharmacokinetics. 2aMaillard Reaction. 2aMale 2aRegression Analysis 2aSoybeansxchemistryxmetabolismxstandards. 2aTime Factors 2aWeight Gainxphysiology 0aheat treatment1 aParsons, C.M.0 tPoultry science.g1996 Feb., v. 75, no. 2 p.224-231x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps.07502243Available from publisher's Web site  a19961002b19961007c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle04315naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002800110040001800138100001500156245011800171300001600289520272000305650001103025650002103036650002303057650002303080650001603103650002103119650001703140650002103157650002303178650001803201650001603219650002503235650001203260650003303272650006103305650003603366650003303402650002303435653002003458653001103478700001603489700001503505700001703520700001703537773007303554852000903627856007803636930003303714945001303747946001303760655001203773IND2052920020221117235205.0960909e199606  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205292002DNAL7 a87378302pmid7 a10.3382/ps.07506832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYonash, N.10aGenetic differences and heritability of antibody response to Escherichia coli vaccination in young broiler chicks  ap. 683-690.  aBroiler chicken lines, selected divergently for high (HC) or low (LC) antibody titer to Escherichia coli vaccination at an early age, were evaluated for antibody response at the S5 and S9 generations of selection. The full-pedigreed populations consisted of about 300 and 400 chicks per line in S5 and S9, respectively. At S5, all chicks were vaccinated at 10 d of age (VA10) and antibody titer was determined twice for each chick, at 8 and 12 d postvaccination (dPV). At S9, each line was divided into two equal groups; in the HC line, one group was vaccinated at 8 d of age (VA8), and the other at 10 d of age (VA10), whereas in the LC line, one group was VA10 and the other was VA12. Antibody titers were determined twice for each chick, 8 and 10 dPV. The effects of line, age at vaccination (VA), and days for antibody development (dPV) were tested, and the heritability of antibody titer was estimated for each line-VA-dPV set of data. The HC and LC lines differed significantly in the maturation process of their immune systems. The percentage of chicks with detectable antibody at 18 d of age (VA10-8 dPV) among HC chicks was significantly higher than among LC chicks (85 vs 48% in S5 and 96 vs 63% in S9). In S9, 90% of the HC chicks had already responded at 16 d of age and 100% at 18 d of age, whereas among the LC chicks, only 62% were positive at 18 d of age, increasing to no more than 98% at 22 d of age. The results demonstrates that selection of antibody titer to E. coli vaccination at 20 d of age actually affects the earliest age of immune response, as the immune system of the HC chicks matures earlier than that of the LC chicks. The HC S9 chicks at 8 dPV exhibited a fourfold higher antibody titer than their LC 8 counterparts. This difference further increased at 10 dPV, indicating that the lines differed not only in the level of antibody at a specific age, but also in their rate of antibody titer development. The highest estimate of heritability was very similar in both lines (0.44 and 0.42 in HC and LC, respectively). However, in the HC line this heritability was exhibited at 18 d of age, and only at 22 d in the LC line. Thus, both lines have a similar amount of genetic variation for early immune response, but in the HC line this variation is fully expressed 4 d earlier than in the LC line. These results suggest that selection for high or low antibody response in young chicks results in early or late antibody production, respectively. To maximize the efficiency of selection for early immune response, one must determine the best vaccination age and timing of antibody evaluation in any given population, and these values must be revalidated and updated as selection proceeds. 3achicks 3aline differences 3aselection criteria 3aantibody formation 3avaccination 3aEscherichia coli 3aheritability 3aimmunocompetence 3agender differences 3agenetic trend 2aAge Factors 2aAnalysis of Variance 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Bacterialxblood 2aBacterial Vaccinesxadministration & dosageximmunology. 2aChickensxgeneticsximmunology. 2aEscherichia coliximmunology 2aSelection, Genetic 0aage differences 0atiming1 aLeitner, G.1 aWaiman, R.1 aHeller, E.D.1 aCahander, A.0 tPoultry science.g1996 June, v. 75, no. 6 p.683-690x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps.07506833Available from publisher's Web site  a20050421b20050501c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle02788naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002800110040001800138100001800156245014300174300001600317520123500333650002101568650001901589650001701608650001601625650001601641650001301657650001201670650004801682650001301730650004901743650002301792650003901815650002201854650004301876650003501919650001601954650001701970653001901987653002402006700001902030700001402049773007302063852000902136856007802145930003302223945001302256946001302269655001202282IND2052759120221117235159.0960826e199602  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205275912DNAL7 a88333812pmid7 a10.3382/ps.07502612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRussell, S.M.14aThe effect of temperature mishandling at various times during storage on detection of temperature abuse of fresh broiler chicken carcasses  ap. 261-264.  aExperiments were conducted to determine the effect that temperature mishandling at various times during storage has on detection of temperature abuse of fresh broiler chicken carcasses using populations of mesophilic and coliform bacteria as indicators of abuse. Forty-five broiler carcasses were used in each of three independent trials. Five carcasses were analyzed at day of collection (Treatment 0 control). Five carcasses, on each day of the next 7 d (Treatments 1 to 7) were temperature-abused for 12 h at 25 C, stored at 3 C until Day 9, and then sampled. The five remaining carcasses were stored at 3 C and sampled on Day 9 (Treatment 8 control). Carcasses were sampled using a whole carcass rinse procedure and assayed for aerobic plate counts (APC), total coliform counts (TCC), impedance detection times (DT), and impedance coliform detection times (DTCM). Although significant differences were noted using all four microbiological methods, temperature abuse at different times during storage had no consistent effect on populations of mesophilic or coliform bacteria; therefore, temperature abuse determinations may be conducted without regard to the day on which the carcasses were subjected to elevated temperatures. 3abroiler chickens 3ameat carcasses 3acold storage 3atemperature 3aplate count 3abacteria 2aAnimals 2aBacteria, Aerobicxisolation & purification 2aChickens 2aEnterobacteriaceaexisolation & purification 2aFood Contamination 2aFood Handlingxmethodsxstandards. 2aFood Microbiology 2aFood Preservationxmethodsxstandards. 2aMeatxmicrobiologyxstandards. 2aTemperature 2aTime Factors 0acoliform count 0amesophilic bacteria1 aFletcher, D.L.1 aCox, N.A.0 tPoultry science.g1996 Feb., v. 75, no. 2 p.261-264x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps.07502613Available from publisher's Web site  a19961002b19961007c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle03988naa a2200889 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002800110040001800138100002500156245012500181300001600306520149900322650001301821650001901834650002301853650001001876650002001886650002501906650001301931650002601944650001501970650001201985650001801997650002302015650003502038650001102073650002002084650002502104650001102129650000902140650002702149650002802176653002802204653001902232653001902251653001902270653001902289653001902308653001902327653001902346653001902365653001902384653001902403653001902422653001902441653001902460653001902479653001902498653001902517653001902536653001902555653001902574653001902593653001902612653001902631653001902650653001902669653001902688653001902707653001902726653001902745653002002764700002202784700001702806700002402823700002002847773007302867852000902940856007802949930003303027945001303060946001303073655001203086IND2052922320221117235439.0960909e199606  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205292232DNAL7 a87378402pmid7 a10.3382/ps.07507462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCrooijmans, R.P.M.A.10aPreliminary linkage map of the chicken (Gallus domesticus) genome based on microsatellite markers: 77 new markers mapped  ap. 746-754.  aMicrosatellite polymorphisms are finding increasing use in genetics. The objectives of this study were 1) to enlarge the number of markers to contribute to a well-defined linkage map of the chicken genome; and 2) to create a preliminary linkage map only based on microsatellite markers. The need for microsatellite markers is high for performing a whole genome scan for the identification of quantitative trait loci. Seventy-seven newly developed microsatellite markers that were polymorphic on either one or both of the reference populations were mapped and in combination with all previously described markers, used to construct a preliminary linkage map of the chicken genome. The 128 microsatellite markers mapped thus far cover 23 of the 38 linkage groups of the East Lansing reference population. In the case of the Compton reference population, 20 linkage groups out of 40 are covered with microsatellite markers. No linkage was found in the East Lansing population with five markers, and in the case of the Compton population four markers were unlinked. About 42 and 32% of the East Lansing and Compton maps, respectively, were covered by the 128 microsatellite markers. The microsatellite markers are well dispersed among the various linkage groups and there was no evidence for clustering of the markers within the map. With the 38 markers that were mapped on both reference populations, 10 of the East Lansing linkage groups could be associated with 13 of the Compton linkage groups. 3achickens 3alinkage groups 3achromosome mapping 3aacids 3agenetic markers 3anucleotide sequences 3agenomics 3agenetic recombination 3apopulation 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aChickensxgenetics 2aChromosome Mappingxveterinary 2aFemale 2aGenetic Linkage 2aGenetics, Population 2aGenome 2aMale 2aMicrosatellite Repeats 2aMolecular Sequence Data 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/l40044 0agenbank/l40045 0agenbank/l40046 0agenbank/l40051 0agenbank/l40053 0agenbank/l40047 0agenbank/l40048 0agenbank/l40049 0agenbank/l40050 0agenbank/l40054 0agenbank/l40055 0agenbank/l40056 0agenbank/l40057 0agenbank/l40058 0agenbank/l40059 0agenbank/l40060 0agenbank/l40061 0agenbank/l40062 0agenbank/l40063 0agenbank/l40064 0agenbank/l40065 0agenbank/l40066 0agenbank/l40067 0agenbank/l40068 0agenbank/l40069 0agenbank/l40070 0agenbank/l40071 0agenbank/l40072 0agenbank/l40073+1 aOers, P.A.M. van.1 aStrijk, J.A.1 aPoel, J.J. van der.1 aGroenen, M.A.M.0 tPoultry science.g1996 June, v. 75, no. 6 p.746-754x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps.07507463Available from publisher's Web site  a19961002b19961007c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle02513naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001700171245007200188300001600260500002400276520124400300650002501544650000901569650002601578650001201604650001801616650001201634650004401646650003801690650002901728650001101757650003401768650000901802650002601811650004501837650002201882700002101904773010201925852000902027856005502036655001202091IND4398594420221117235146.0071209e200712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439859442DNAL7 a180676172pmid7 a10.1111/j.1532-950X.2007.00334.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSHORES, ANDY12aA Modified Ventral Approach to the Atlantoaxial Junction in the Dog  ap. 765-770.  aIncludes references  aTo describe and evaluate a surgical technique using a modified ventral approach for stabilization of the atlantoaxial (AA) junction in dogs with AA subluxation. Retrospective study. Dogs (n=5) with AA subluxation. Medical records (2000-2006) of 5 dogs with AA treated by stabilization via a right parasagittal approach were reviewed and outcome assessed by clinical examination and phone interviews with owners. The AA joint was clearly visualized and fixation devices were placed in all dogs. A right parasagittal approach provided excellent access to the AA junction and avoided dissection around the thyroid gland, trachea, and recurrent laryngeal nerve. Recovery was considered good to excellent by owners, and dogs returned to good function. A right parasagittal approach to the AA junction provides improved exposure and allows for surgical stabilization with minimal complications. In dogs that require surgical stabilization of the AA joint, a right parasagittal approach should be considered. This approach offers advantages over the standard ventral median approach by improved surgical exposure, less dissection, and provides protection of vital structures during insertion of fixation devices used for ventral AA stabilization. 3aclinical examination 3adogs 3aretrospective studies 3asurgery 3athyroid gland 2aAnimals 2aAtlanto-Axial Jointxinjuriesxsurgery. 2aDislocationsxsurgeryxveterinary 2aDogsxinjuriesxsurgery. 2aFemale 2aInternal Fixatorsxveterinary 2aMale 2aRetrospective Studies 2aSurgery, Veterinaryxmethodsxstandards. 2aTreatment Outcome1 aTEPPER, LAURA C.0 tVeterinary surgery.g2007 Dec., v. 36, no. 8 p.765-770dBlackwell Publishing Incx0161-34997nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-950X.2007.00334.x 7aarticle03278naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002800110040001800138100001700156245017800173300001800351520148800369650000901857650001601866650001001882650001901892650002301911650000901934650002701943650001201970650003801982650002702020650001902047650006702066650001102133650006602144650004602210650006002256650002902316650002602345650001302371653001402384653003702398700001402435700001802449700001902467700001702486773007502503852000902578856007802587930003302665945001302698946001302711655001202724IND2036425020221117234754.0931221e199308  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203642502DNAL7 a83782212pmid7 a10.3382/ps.07214792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWalzem, R.L.10aFatty liver hemorrhagic syndrome in hens overfed a purified diet. Selected enzyme activities and liver histology in relation to liver hemorrhage and reproductive performance  ap. 1479-1491.  aA nutritionally adequate, purified diet was developed and used in studies to characterize selected aspects of laying hens in which fatty liver hemorrhagic syndrome (FLHS) was induced by overfeeding. Hens consuming the diet ad libitum or intubated with the diet in quantities equivalent to usual daily energy intake maintained normal rates of lay, did not become obese, and did not develop liver hemorrhage. Overfed hens had a 33% incidence of FLHS, as indicated by the presence of severe liver hemorrhage score, and displayed the full range of symptoms associated with spontaneous outbreaks of FLHS, including definitive lesions of hepatic reticulin. Among four groups of hens clinically classified according to rates of liver hemorrhage and egg production, there were no differences noted in total liver fat, liver fat concentration, or final body weight. Liver hemorrhage was associated with the degree of induction of liver lipogenic accessory enzymes. Serum enzyme activities indicate that overfed hens, unlike the overfed goose, retain hepatocellular membrane integrity. Overfeeding caused altered reproductive performance in 72% of hens. Alterations included erratic laying, increased incidence of double ovulations, shell defects, follicular collapse, and oviduct involution. Pattern of lay preceding necropsy seemed to influence follicle weight at necropsy. The data presented re-emphasize the interdependence among liver, ovary, and oviduct function in the etiology of FLHS. 3ahens 3aoverfeeding 3aliver 3ahistopathology 3alaying performance 3adiet 2aAnimal Feedxpoisoning 2aAnimals 2aChickensxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aDisease Models, Animal 2aEnzymesxblood 2aFatty Liverxetiologyxpathologyxphysiopathologyxveterinary. 2aFemale 2aHemorrhagexetiologyxpathologyxphysiopathologyxveterinary. 2aLiverxenzymologyxmetabolismxpathology. 2aPoultry Diseasesxetiologyxpathologyxphysiopathology. 2aReproductionxphysiology 2aReticulinxmetabolism 2aSyndrome 0afollicles 0afatty liver hemorrhagic syndrome1 aSimon, C.1 aMorishita, T.1 aLowenstine, L.1 aHansen, R.J.0 tPoultry science.g1993 Aug., v. 72, no. 8 p.1479-1491x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps.07214793Available from publisher's Web site  a19940105b19940110c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle02619naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002800110040001800138100001800156245011400174300001800288520125300306650001701559650001701576650001601593650001501609650001401624650002201638650002501660650003001685650001201715650002701727650001701754650004101771650002701812650001601839650001901855700001901874700001901893700001601912773007501928852000902003856007802012930003302090945001302123946001302136655001202149IND2036430620221117234803.0931221e199308  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203643062DNAL7 a83782242pmid7 a10.3382/ps.07215732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRussell, S.M.10aEffect of lactic acid fermentation on bacterial pathogens and indicator organisms in broiler processing waste  ap. 1573-1576.  aBroiler processing offal (heads, viscera, and feet) was collected on 3 separate days from a commercial processing plant. Each sample was separately ground, supplemented with sucrose (6% initial concentration), inoculated with actively growing lactic acid bacteria (10(6) cfu/g of offal) from a commercial silage culture, and fermented at 37 C. Replicate samples were taken for standard microbiological analysis after 0, 48, and 120 h of fermentation. In fresh offal, heterotrophic plate count, total and fecal coliforms, fecal streptococci, and Aeromonas hydrophila concentrations were 7.4, 5.9, 5.9, 5.4, and 3.9 log(10) cfu/g wet weight, respectively. After 48 h of fermentation, the bacterial concentrations were 7.6, 2.2, < 1.3, 5.5, and < 2.3 log(10) cfu/g wet weight, respectively. After 120 h of fermentation, the bacterial concentrations were 6.9, < 1.1, < 1.1, < 1.1, and < 1.1 log(10) cfu/g wet weight, respectively. Salmonella concentrations in fresh, 48-h fermented, and 120-h fermented offal samples were 3.7, < 1.5, and < 1.5 log(10) most-probable-number/100 g wet weight, respectively. Lactic acid fermentation appears to be effective in reducing the number of bacterial pathogens and indicator organisms in poultry processing offal. 3apoultry meal 3afermentation 3aplate count 3aSalmonella 3aAeromonas 3acoliform bacteria 3alactic acid bacteria 2aAnimal Feedxmicrobiology 2aAnimals 2aChickensxmicrobiology 2aFermentation 2aGram-Negative Bacteriaxdrug effects 2aLactatesxpharmacology 2aLactic Acid 2aWaste Products1 aFletcher, D.L.1 aPancorbo, O.C.1 aMerka, W.C.0 tPoultry science.g1993 Aug., v. 72, no. 8 p.1573-1576x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps.07215733Available from publisher's Web site  a19940105b19940110c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle03240naa a2200721 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100001400156245009300170300001600263500001500279520116100294650002101455650002801476650001901504650001001523650001701533650001301550650001501563650001501578650001901593650001401612650002501626650001201651650001701663650002001680650001001700650002801710650004101738650002601779650002101805650002201826650002701848650002401875650003901899650002201938650002501960650003701985650002302022650001702045653002702062653001702089653001902106653001302125700001602138700001702154700001702171700001802188700001502206700002402221700001602245773010002261852000902361856007702370930003302447945001302480946001302493655001202506IND2324837620221117234822.0020115e200102  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232483762DNAL7 a112620592pmid7 a10.1021/jf001045m2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNoots, I.10aDegradation of starchy endosperm cell walls in nongerminating sterilized barley by fungi  ap. 975-981.  a2019-12-04  aStrains of fungi from different origins, including isolates of the natural microflora of barley, were screened for their ability to modify barley starchy endosperm cell walls in situ. In an initial step, fungi were selected that degrade the major component of the cell walls, that is, (1 leads to 3),(1 leads to 4)-beta-D-glucan, in vitro on artificial media. Nongerminating, sterilized barley, obtained by gamma-irradiation, was inoculated with such fungi and subjected to solid state fermentation under conditions resembling those of a traditional malting process. For some strains of fungi, a clear correlation between the production of endo-beta-glucanase and the friability of the treated kernels was found. Image analysis of Calcofluor stained longitudinal sections of barley kernels fermented with the endo-beta-glucanase producing strains showed that starchy endosperm cell walls were modified. As malt quality is inversely related to its (1 leads to 3),(1 leads to 4)-beta-D-glucan content, the selected strains have high potential to be used as starter cultures during malt production, contributing to the processing quality of the final product. 3astarter cultures 3acarbohydrate metabolism 3amalting barley 3aMucor 3afermentation 3aRhizopus 3aGeotrichum 3acell walls 3abeta-glucanase 3aendosperm 3acell wall components 3amalting 3abeta-glucans 3amalting quality 3afungi 2aAspergillusxmetabolism 2aCell Wallxmetabolismxmicrobiology. 2aCellulasexmetabolism 2aFood Irradiation 2aFungixmetabolism 2aGeotrichumxmetabolism 2aGlucansxmetabolism 2aHordeumxmetabolismxmicrobiology. 2aMucorxmetabolism 2aRhizopusxmetabolism 2aSeedsxmetabolismxmicrobiology. 2aStarchxmetabolism 2abeta-Glucans 0aO-glycoside hydrolases 0aglycosidases 0amicroorganisms 0axylanase1 aDerycke, V.1 aCornelis, K.1 aMichiels, C.1 aDelcour, J.A.1 aDelrue, R.1 aKeersmaeker, J. de.1 aCoppens, T.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2001 Feb., v. 49, no. 2 p.975-981x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf001045m3Available from publisher's Web site  a20020301b20020307c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle03723naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142072001700160072001700177072001700194100001800211245010600229300001400335520177300349650002102122650002002143650002002163650001802183650001602201650002302217650002602240650002002266650001802286650001802304650001402322650001902336650001202355650002502367650001002392650001202402650002302414650002002437650001602457650001602473650004702489650001202536650002502548650006802573650005602641650005902697650001802756650001102774650001802785650000902803773010002812852000902912856008102921930003303002945002503035946001303060655001203073IND4399041020221117234825.0071216e200801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439904102DNAL7 a180794552pmid7 a10.3382/ps.2007-001732doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aLatshaw, J.D.10aDaily Energy Intake of Broiler Chickens is Altered by Proximate Nutrient Content and Form of the Diet  ap. 89-95.  aAn experiment was designed to test the ability of broiler chickens to equalize daily energy intake when proximate components of the diet were changed. A factorial arrangement was used to test effects of protein, fat, and fiber content in the diet. The simplest diet contained only corn and soybean meal to provide energy and protein. Protein contents were calculated to be 16.4, 18.2, and 20.0%, with added protein from a combination of corn gluten meal, fish meal, and peanut meal. Hydrolyzed fat was added at 0, 2.5, 5.0, and 7.5% of the diets. A combination of alfalfa meal, oats, and wheat middlings was used to increase the fiber of the corn soy diet by approximately 2 and 4%. The 36 combinations were fed as mash. In addition, 8 of the diets were fed as pellets. All diets were fed for 12 d from the time broilers reached approximately 1.2 kg. A total excreta collection was used to determine ME, and carcass analysis provided fat and energy content. When fed mash, only sex had a significant effect on grams of feed eaten per day. Sex and dietary fat content affected gain per day. Sex, fat, and fiber altered the kcal of ME eaten per day. Broilers fed 5% added fat ate approximately 10% more energy per day than those fed no added fat, and broilers fed 4% added fiber ate approximately 20% less ME than those fed no added fiber. A comparison of results from mash and pellets showed that only sex and form affected gain per day, feed per day, and kilocalories of ME eaten per day. For the mash and pellets, protein, fat, fiber, and several interactions affected the ME per gram; however, the ME per gram was similar for pellets and mash. The results suggest that the diet composition and form have a significant effect on the energy intake of broiler chickens. 3abroiler chickens 3abroiler feeding 3anutrient intake 3aenergy intake 3afeed intake 3aad libitum feeding 3aproximate composition 3aprotein content 3alipid content 3afiber content 3amash feed 3apelleted feeds 3aexcreta 3ametabolizable energy 3amales 3afemales 3agender differences 3aliveweight gain 3abody weight 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aAnimals 2aChickensxmetabolism 2aDietary Fats, Unsaturatedxadministration & dosagexmetabolism. 2aDietary Fiberxadministration & dosagexmetabolism. 2aDietary Proteinsxadministration & dosagexmetabolism. 2aEnergy Intake 2aFemale 2aLinear Models 2aMale0 tPoultry science.g2008 Jan., v. 87, no. 1 p.89-95dPoultry Science Associationx0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps.2007-001733Available from publisher's Web site  a20080707b20080801c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/06/24  aOther US 7aarticle04107naa a2200841 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142072001700160072001700177072001700194100001800211245009500229300001400324500001500338520183800353650001402191650001002205650002502215650002102240650001302261650001702274650002002291650001302311650001702324650002102341650002802362650001602390650001502406650001902421650001102440650001602451650002002467650002002487650001302507650001602520650003002536650001202566650001602578650002502594650001102619650001102630650000902641650002002650650001302670650002202683650001202705650001002717653001902727653002302746653001702769700001902786700001702805700001702822700001802839700002602857700001802883700001502901700001502916700001902931700002102950700002102971773010002992852000903092856008103101930003303182945002503215946001303240655001203253IND4399040820221117234819.0071216e200801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439904082DNAL7 a180794532pmid7 a10.3382/ps.2007-001472doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aPonte, P.I.P.10aPasture Intake Improves the Performance and Meat Sensory Attributes of Free-Range Broilers  ap. 71-79.  a2019-12-04  aFree-range chickens are assumed to consume low to moderate levels of pasture, although the effects of forage intake in broiler performance and poultry meat quality remain to be established. In addition, despite cellulases and hemicellulases being widely used as feed supplements to improve the nutritive value of cereal-based diets for fast-growing broilers, the potential interest of these biocatalysts in the production of free-range chicken is yet to be established. In this study, broilers of the RedBro Cou Nu x RedBro M genotype were fed a cereal-based diet in portable floorless pens located either on a rainfed subterranean clover (Trifolium subterraneum) pasture or on an irrigated white clover (Trifolium repens) pasture. Control birds were maintained at the same site in identical pens but with no access to pastures. The importance of pasture intake and enzyme supplementation in the performance and meat sensory properties of the free-range chicken from d 28 to 56 was investigated. The results revealed that although cellulase and hemicellulase supplementation had no impact on broiler performance (P > 0.05), birds foraging on legume-based pastures reached significantly greater final BW. The data suggest that the improvement in broiler performance results from increased intake of the cereal-based feed rather than from an improvement in the efficiency of nutrient utilization per se. Interestingly, although the intake of the subterranean clover pasture had no impact on the tenderness, juiciness, and flavor of broiler meat, members of a 30-person consumer panel classified the meat from grazing broilers with greater scores for overall appreciation. Together, the results suggest that pasture intake promotes bird performance while contributing to the production of broiler meat with preferred sensory attributes. 3ajuiciness 3afeeds 3afree range husbandry 3abroiler chickens 3apastures 3achicken meat 3aliveweight gain 3agenotype 3apalatability 3afeed supplements 3anutrient use efficiency 3abody weight 3acellulases 3aforage legumes 3aflavor 3afeed intake 3anutritive value 3ameat tenderness 3aforaging 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimal Husbandryxmethods 2aAnimals 2aBody Weight 2aChickensxmetabolism 2aEating 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMeatxstandards 2aMedicago 2aRandom Allocation 2aSeasons 2aTaste 0ahemicellulases 0asensory properties 0ameat quality1 aRosado, C.M.C.1 aCrespo, J.P.1 aCrespo, D.G.1 aMourão, J.L.1 aChaveiro-Soares, M.A.1 aBrás, J.L.A.1 aMendes, I.1 aGama, L.T.1 aPrates, J.A.M.1 aFerreira, L.M.A.1 aFontes, C.M.G.A.0 tPoultry science.g2008 Jan., v. 87, no. 1 p.71-79dPoultry Science Associationx0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps.2007-001473Available from publisher's Web site  a20080707b20080801c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/06/24  aOther US 7aarticle03168naa a2200721 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100001700156245016300173300001800336520105900354650001701413650002001430650001401450650001601464650001601480650001401496650001801510650001101528650002301539650001101562650001401573650002701587650001001614650002701624650003101651650003001682650000901712650002901721650002501750650000901775650001901784650001801803650003001821650003001851650002401881650001501905653001501920653002101935653002501956653003501981653001702016653001602033700001902049700001802068700001702086700001302103700001902116700001502135700002102150700001602171773010202187852000902289856007702298930003302375945001302408946001302421655001202434IND2324838220221117234836.0020115e200102  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232483822DNAL7 a112620642pmid7 a10.1021/jf000729r2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJacobsen, C.10aLipid oxidation in fish oil enriched mayonnaise: calcium disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate, but not gallic acid, strongly inhibited oxidative deterioration  ap. 1009-1019.  aThe antioxidative effects of gallic acid, EDTA, and extra emulsifier Panodan DATEM TR in mayonnaise enriched with 16% fish oil were investigated. EDTA reduced the formation of free radicals, lipid hydroperoxides, volatiles, and fishy and rancid off-flavors. The antioxidative effect of EDTA was attributed to its ability to chelate free metal ions and iron from egg yolk located at the oil-water interface. Gallic acid reduced the levels of both free radicals and lipid hydroperoxides but promoted slightly the oxidative flavor deterioration in mayonnaise and influenced the profile of volatiles. Gallic acid may therefore promote the decomposition of lipid hydroperoxides to volatile oxidation products. Addition of extra emulsifier reduced the lipid hydroperoxide levels but did not influence the level of free radicals or the oxidative flavor deterioration in mayonnaise; however, it appeared to alter the profile of volatiles. The effect of the emulsifier on the physical structure and rheological properties depended on the presence of antioxidants. 3arapeseed oil 3asalad dressings 3afish oils 3agallic acid 3aemulsifiers 3aoxidation 3afree radicals 3alipids 3avolatile compounds 3aflavor 3arancidity 3arheological properties 3aodors 3aEDTA (chelating agent) 2aAntioxidantsxpharmacology 2aEdetic Acidxpharmacology 2aEggs 2aExcipientsxpharmacology 2aFish Oilsxchemistry 2aFood 2aFood Additives 2aFood Handling 2aGallic Acidxpharmacology 2aLipid Peroxidesxanalysis 2aOdorantsxanalysis. 2aPlant Oils 0ainhibition 0apanodan datem tr 0alipid hydroperoxides 0aoxidative flavor deterioration 0afishy flavor 0afishy aroma1 aHartvigsen, K.1 aThomsen, M.K.1 aHansen, L.F.1 aLund, P.1 aSkibsted, L.H.1 aHolmer, G.1 aAdler-Nissen, J.1 aMeyer, A.S.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2001 Feb., v. 49, no. 2 p.1009-1019x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf000729r3Available from publisher's Web site  a20020301b20020307c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle02256naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100001500156245010100171300001800272500001500290520077900305650001201084650001301096650002101109650001601130650001401146650002001160650003301180650002601213650002201239650002201261650001301283650002401296650003201320650002401352653001201376653002501388653002101413700002301434700002301457700002301480773010201503852000901605856007701614930003301691945001301724946001301737655001201750IND2324838120221117234800.0020115e200102  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232483812DNAL7 a112620632pmid7 a10.1021/jf001010m2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLaveda, F.10aProteolytic activation of latent Paraguaya peach PPO.

By coupling this activation process to the oxidation of 4-tert-butylcatechol (TBC) to its corresponding quinone, it was possible to evaluate the specific rate constant of active PPO formation, k3, which showed a value of 0.04 s(-1). This proteolytic activation of latent peach PPO permitted us to characterize the monophenolase activity of peach PPO for the first time using p-cresol as substrate, and it showed the characteristic lag period of the kinetic mechanism of monophenols hydroxylation, which depended on the enzyme and substrate concentration, the pH and the presence of catalytic amounts of o-diphenol (4-methylcatechol). The enzyme activation constant, k(act), was 2 micromolar. 3apeaches 3ap-cresol 3acatechol oxidase 3aproteolysis 3aoxidation 3aenzyme activity 2aCatechol Oxidasexmetabolism 2aCatecholsxmetabolism 2aEnzyme Activation 2aFruitxenzymology 2aKinetics 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aOxidoreductasesxmetabolism 2aTrypsinxmetabolism 0aphenols 0a4-tert-butylcatechol 0a4-methylcatechol1 aNunez-Delicado, E.1 aGarcia-Carmona, F.1 aSanchez-Ferrer, A.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2001 Feb., v. 49, no. 2 p.1003-1008x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf001010m3Available from publisher's Web site  a20020301b20020307c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle02545naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002800110040001800138100001600156245011300172300001800285500001500303520105200318650001301370650001701383650001601400650002601416650001601442650001201458650001201470650002601482650006001508650002501568650001101593650003801604650000901642650003101651650005001682653001601732653002001748653001301768653002001781700001701801773007501818852000901893856007801902930003301980945001302013946001302026655001202039IND2036424120221117235006.0931221e199308  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203642412DNAL7 a83782142pmid7 a10.3382/ps.07214002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmith, E.J.10aEffect of tumor virus susceptibility alleles on the late-feathering gene K on early growth of White Leghorns  ap. 1400-1404.  a2019-12-04  aThe influence of tumor virus susceptibility (tvb) alleles and the sex-linked, late-feathering-endogenous virus 21 complex (K-ev21) on early growth was observed in progeny from late-feathering (LF) and early-feathering (EF) dams. At 2, 4, 6 and 10 wk of age, homozygous (K/K) males that carried a dominant tvb(s1) allele were significantly (P < .05) lighter in total body weight than K/K homozygous endogenous virus (EV) EV21-resistant (tvb(r)/tvb(r)) hatchmates. Among heterozygous (K/k+) males, tvb(s1) did not significantly influence growth when compared with tvb(r)/tvb(r) hatchmates. At 10 wk of age, tvb(s1)-positive K/w female progeny from LF dams were also significantly lighter than tvb(r)/tvb(r) K/w hatchmates. However, among progeny from EF dams no significant within sex differences in body weight were found regardless of their feather or EV susceptibility phenotype. Results indicate that susceptibility to EV21 infection is particularly detrimental to early growth of ev21-K homozygous male and hemizygous female progeny of LF dams. 3achickens 3aRetroviridae 3abody weight 3abiological resistance 3agene dosage 2aAlleles 2aAnimals 2aBody Weightxgenetics 2aChickensxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmicrobiology. 2aFeathersxphysiology 2aFemale 2aGenetic Predisposition to Disease 2aMale 2aPoultry Diseasesxgenetics 2aTumor Virus Infectionsxgeneticsxveterinary. 0agrowth rate 0afeathering rate 0agenotype 0aage differences1 aNelsen, T.C.0 tPoultry science.g1993 Aug., v. 72, no. 8 p.1400-1404x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps.07214003Available from publisher's Web site  a19940105b19940110c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle03218naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002800110040001800138100001900156245011000175300001800285520163500303650002101938650001201959650001601971650002101987650002402008650001602032650002002048650002002068650001302088650001602101650001202117650002602129650005802155650002802213650001102241650003702252650003102289650000902320650004902329650006602378653001602444700001902460773007502479852000902554856007802563930003302641945001302674946001302687655001202700IND2036424020221117235018.0931221e199308  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203642402DNAL7 a83782132pmid7 a10.3382/ps.07213912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEberhart, D.E.10aAssessing the effects of the naked neck gene on chronic heat stress resistance in two genetic populations  ap. 1391-1399.  aThe effect of the naked neck (Na) gene on resistance to chronic heat stress was studied in the F2 generation of two populations of chickens genetically differing in growth. The Na gene was introduced into the Athens-Canadian randombred (ACRB), a small BW population, and into a large BW commercial broiler population. Naked neck and normally feathered birds were maintained in either a chronic heat stress (32 C) environment or a control (21 C) environment from 4 to 8 wk of age. Body weight, BW gain, feed consumption, and feed efficiency were calculated at 4, 6, and 8 wk. The 32 C environment significantly reduced gain and feed consumption at all age intervals in both populations. Feed conversion ratio (FCR) was lower in the 32 C environment in the ACRB population, but in the broiler population FCR either was the same or increased when compared with the 21 C environment. In the F2 generation of both populations the naked neck birds were significantly larger than the normally feathered birds although the two types segregated from the same parents. In the ACRB population the relative growth response was not significantly different between naked neck and normal feathered birds, indicating that the Na gene did not confer resistance to chronic heat stress in the small BW population. In the broiler population, an assessment of the relative growth response in the 32 C environment showed that the naked neck birds had a smaller reduction in BW gain and better feed efficiency than the normally feathered birds, indicating that in the large BW broiler population the Na gene did confer resistance to chronic heat stress. 3abroiler chickens 3aalleles 3aheat stress 3aline differences 3aambient temperature 3abody weight 3aliveweight gain 3afeed conversion 3afeathers 3afeed intake 2aAnimals 2aBody Weightxgenetics 2aChickensxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aFeathersxabnormalities 2aFemale 2aHot Temperaturexadverse effects 2aImmunity, Innatexgenetics 2aMale 2aPoultry Diseasesxgeneticsxphysiopathology. 2aStress, Physiologicalxgeneticsxphysiopathologyxveterinary. 0agrowth rate1 aWashburn, K.W.0 tPoultry science.g1993 Aug., v. 72, no. 8 p.1391-1399x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps.07213913Available from publisher's Web site  a19940105b19940110c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle02996naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100001600156245013100172300001800303500001500321520104500336650001901381650002301400650001201423650002601435650001201461650001401473650001101487650002601498650002201524650001301546650001901559650001501578650000901593650001201602650002801614650002301642650003301665650002301698650001401721650002601735650001101761650002401772650002301796650002001819650001101839650002601850650003401876650000901910650002401919650000901943650001701952653002001969653001701989700001302006700001602019700001602035773010202051852000902153856007702162930003302239945001302272946001302285655001202298IND2324839820221117235130.0020115e200102  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232483982DNAL7 a112620702pmid7 a10.1021/jf001008v2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSeiquer, I.10aEffects of heat treatment of casein in the presence of reducing sugars on calcium bioavailability: in vitro and in vivo assays  ap. 1049-1055.  a2019-12-04  aCasein-glucose-fructose mixtures unheated (C) or after heating (HC) were added to a solution of ionic calcium to study calcium speciation and included in diets (C-D, HC-D) for rats. Samples and diets were digested in vitro. Supernatants of digested samples were used for transport experiments with Caco-2 cells. Total soluble and ionic calcium levels were lower and precipitated calcium levels higher with HC compared to C. Dialyzed calcium from the diets was highly ionic and lower in HC-D compared to C-D. Nondialyzed soluble calcium was also lower, whereas precipitated calcium was higher, in HC-D. HC increased calcium transport in Caco-2 cells compared to C, but transport efficiency decreased due to lower calcium solubility after digestion. Urinary calcium increased with HC-D consumption without changes in calcium absorbed and retained. Maillard reaction products in HC decrease calcium solubility, but enterocyte metabolism and calcium absorption and retention seem to be unaffected. Nevertheless, urinary calcium losses increase. 3ainorganic ions 3anutrient transport 3aglucose 3anutrient availability 3acalcium 3adigestion 3acasein 3aintestinal absorption 3aintestinal mucosa 3afructose 3aheat treatment 3acell lines 3arats 2aAnimals 2aBiological Availability 2aCalciumxchemistry 2aCalcium, Dietaryxmetabolism 2aCaseinsxchemistry 2aCell Line 2aDigestionxphysiology 2aFemale 2aFructosexchemistry 2aGlucosexchemistry 2aHot Temperature 2aHumans 2aIntestinal Absorption 2aIntestinal Mucosaxmetabolism 2aMale 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aRats 2aRats, Wistar 0abioavailability 0acaco-2 cells1 aAspe, T.1 aVaquero, P.1 aNavarro, P.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2001 Feb., v. 49, no. 2 p.1049-1055x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf001008v3Available from publisher's Web site  a20020301b20020307c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle03652naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002800110040001800138100001600156245011900172300001800291500001500309520194700324650002102271650001802292650002302310650002002333650002702353650001302380650001502393650001102408650004002419650001202459650002102471650002802492650003502520650001102555650003602566650000902602653001902611653001502630653002402645653002102669653001902690700001702709700001202726700001702738700001902755700001902774700001902793700001702812773007502829852000902904856007802913930003302991945001303024946001303037655001203050IND2036424320221117235033.0931221e199308  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203642432DNAL7 a83782162pmid7 a10.3382/ps.07214112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLirette, A.10aIn vivo nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy of chicken embryos from two broiler strains of varying fat content  ap. 1411-1420.  a2019-12-04  aIn vivo nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) imaging and spectroscopy techniques were used to monitor changes in P- and H-containing molecules in embryos of two broiler strains (30 and 31) differing genetically in fat content and ranging in age from 0 to 20 days of incubation. Chemical analysis showed that Strain 30 has more carcass fat than Strain 31 at market age (7 wk). Proton (1H) and 31P spectra were obtained on four eggs per strain at Days 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 11, 12, 14, 16, 17, 19, and 20 of incubation. Fat:water, phosphomonoester (PME):phosphodiester (PDE), and adenosine triphosphate (ATP):PDE ratios were calculated. Chicks were hatched, grown to market weight (2,000 g for females and 2,300 g for males at 7 wk), and the whole intact carcasses were analyzed for crude fat. Hydrogen-1 NMR spectroscopy studies of incubated eggs indicated no significant difference (P > .05) in the fat:water ratio between the two strains. The difference in the PME:PDE ratios between the two strains as obtained by 31P-NMR spectroscopy over all days of incubation analyzed was not significant (P > .05); however, there was a significant difference in this ratio between the two strains at Days 4, 6, and 11. Up to Day 16, Strain 30 had a slightly, but not significantly (P > .05), higher ATP:PDE ratio as shown on 31P-NMR spectra, whereas after Day 17 the ATP:PDE ratio was significantly higher (P < .01) for Strain 31. Strain 31 birds had a significantly lower (P < .05) crude fat content. There was a significant difference (P < .05) in 7-wk carcass fat content between sexes, males having significantly (P < .01) less fat than females, which was correlated with a significantly higher (P < .01) ATP:PDE ratio in male embryos. It might be possible to use ATP:PDE ratios obtained during embryonic development by 31P-NMR to select strains of birds for low fat content at market weight and to distinguish between sexes during late embryonic development. 3abroiler chickens 3alipid content 3astrain differences 3aembryo (animal) 3aadenosine triphosphate 3ahydrogen 3aphosphorus 3achicks 2aAdipose Tissuexanatomy & histology 2aAnimals 2aBody Composition 2aChick Embryoxchemistry 2aChickensxgrowth & development 2aFemale 2aMagnetic Resonance Spectroscopy 2aMale 0aphosphodiester 0aincubation 0aphosphates (esters) 0aphosphomonoester 0afat percentage1 aTowner, R.A.1 aLiu, Z.1 aJanzen, E.G.1 aChambers, J.R.1 aFairfull, R.W.1 aMilligan, L.P.1 aCrober, D.C.0 tPoultry science.g1993 Aug., v. 72, no. 8 p.1411-1420x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps.07214113Available from publisher's Web site  a19940105b19940110c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle03069naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100002200156245007600178300001800254520148200272650001701754650001901771650001701790650001301807650001901820650001701839650001801856650002701874650002001901650001401921650002401935650002801959650002201987650001402009650004402023650001802067650001102085650002602096650004102122653001302163653001502176653002102191700001402212700001702226700002502243773010202268852000902370856007702379930003302456945001302489946001302502655001202515IND2324839220221117235001.0020115e200102  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232483922DNAL7 a112620682pmid7 a10.1021/jf00005282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGil-Izquierdo, A.10aIn vitro availability of flavonoids and other phenolics in orange juice  ap. 1035-1041.  aHand-squeezed navel orange juice contains 839 mg/L phenolics, including flavanones, flavones, and hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives. The flavanones are the main phenolics in the soluble fraction (648.6 mg/L) and are also present in the cloud fraction (104.8 mg/L). During refrigerated storage of fresh juice (4 degrees C), 50% of the soluble flavanones precipitate and integrate into the cloud fraction. Commercial orange juices contain only 81-200 mg/L soluble flavanones (15-33%) and the content in the cloud is higher (206-644 mg/L) (62-85%), showing that during industrial processing and storage the soluble flavanones precipitate and are included in the cloud. An in vitro simulation of orange juice digestion shows that a serving of fresh orange juice (240 mL) provides 9.7 mg of soluble hesperidin (4'-methoxy-3',5,7-trihydroxyflavanone-7-rutinoside) and 4.7 mg of the C-glycosylflavone vicenin 2 (apigenin, 6,8-di-C-glucoside) for freshly squeezed orange juice, whereas pasteurized commercial juices provide 3.7 mg of soluble hesperidin and a higher amount of vicenin 2 (6.3 mg). This means that although orange juice is a very rich source of flavanones, only a limited quantity is soluble, and this might affect availability for absorption (11-36% of the soluble flavanones, depending on the juice). The flavanones precipitated in the cloud are not available for absorption and are partly transformed to the corresponding chalcones during the pancreatin-bile digestion. 3aorange juice 3apasteurization 3aconcentrates 3aflavones 3acoumaric acids 3acold storage 3arefrigeration 3achemical precipitation 3abioavailability 3adigestion 2aBeveragesxanalysis 2aBiological Availability 2aCitrusxchemistry 2aDigestion 2aFlavonoidsxanalysisxpharmacokinetics. 2aFood Handling 2aHumans 2aIntestinal Absorption 2aPhenolsxanalysisxpharmacokinetics. 0ain vitro 0asimulation 0ajuice extraction1 aGil, M.I.1 aFerreres, F.1 aTomas-Barberan, F.A.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2001 Feb., v. 49, no. 2 p.1035-1041x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf00005283Available from publisher's Web site  a20020301b20020307c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle03133naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002800110040001800138100001800156245015500174300001800329500001500347520141200362650001101774650002001785650001101805650001001816650001601826650002301842650001801865650001701883650002201900650002101922650002401943650001501967650001601982650001201998650001602010650002302026650001102049650002102060650000902081650002302090650002402113650003202137653002102169653002002190653002002210700001502230700001902245700001602264700001702280773007602297852000902373856007802382930003302460945001302493946001302506655001202519IND2037564020221117235011.0940228e199311  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203756402DNAL7 a82654912pmid7 a10.3382/ps.07220192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnthony, N.B.10aDivergent selection for body weight and yolk precursor in Coturnix coturnix japonica. 9. Evaluation of traits associated with onset of sexual maturity  ap. 2019-2029.  a2019-12-04  aAn experiment was conducted to compare traits associated with onset of sexual maturity in Japanese quail lines. Lines divergently selected for high and low 4-wk BW (HW and LW), and high and low total plasma phosphorus at beginning of lay (HP and LP) were compared with a randombred line (RBC1) that served as the base population for HW, LW, HP, and LP. The HW sublines (HW-HP and HW-LP) and LP subline (LP-HW) were also compared to their respective line of origin. Most of the differences observed for males selected for a single trait were found for weight-selected rather than for phosphorus-selected lines. The patterns of significance closely followed differences expected due to the extreme diversity in BW for the HW and LW when compared with RBC1. Females generally matured approximately 2 wk later than males for HW, HP, and LP. Line LW females matured approximately 4 wk later than LW males. Differences were observed for variables associated with onset of sexual maturity for HW, LW, and HP when compared with RBC1. Observed changes in carcass variables for sublines were generally associated with reductions in BW for HW-HP, and HW-LP versus HW and for increases in BW for LP-HW versus LP. The differences were likely due to the fact that two-trait selection (BW for males and total plasma phosphorus in females) has allowed weights to diverge when compared with lines selected for single traits. 3atestes 3asexual maturity 3aweight 3aliver 3abody weight 3agender differences 3aabdominal fat 3ablood plasma 3aCoturnix japonica 3aline differences 3acarcass composition 3aphosphorus 2aAge Factors 2aAnimals 2aBody Weight 2aCoturnixxgenetics 2aFemale 2aLipidsxanalysis 2aMale 2aSelection, Genetic 2aSex Characteristics 2aSexual Maturationxgenetics 0abody composition 0aJapanese quails 0aage differences1 aWall, C.W.1 aEmmerson, D.A.1 aBacon, W.L.1 aNestor, K.E.0 tPoultry science.g1993 Nov., v. 72, no. 11 p.2019-2029x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps.07220193Available from publisher's Web site  a19940415b19940418c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle02431naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100002100156245007700177300001600254520105300270650002201323650002001345650002001365650001901385650001401404650001601418650001201434650002901446650003101475650003501506650001501541650002001556650001501576650002401591650002601615653001501641653001801656700001301674700001701687773010001704852000901804856007701813930003301890945001301923946001301936655001201949IND2324831320221117235115.0020115e200102  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232483132DNAL7 a112620382pmid7 a10.1021/jf000917h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFiniguerra, M.G.10aSoluble and total myrosinase activity in defatted Crambe abyssinica meal  ap. 840-845.  aCrambe defatted meal contains 4-6% w/w of glucosinolates, with epiprogoitrin accounting for >90% of the total. This feature limits the use of the meal as feed due to the antinutritional properties of myrosinase-glucosinolate breakdown products. In this context, myrosinase activity assumes particular importance. In this study the total and soluble myrosinase activities have been evaluated directly on defatted meals of eight Crambe abyssinica varieties. The pH-stat method, which is the most suitable for assays in heterogeneous solid-water systems, was used. The total myrosinase activity in C. abyssinica varieties, determined using epiprogoitrin as substrate, ranged from 288 to 653 units g(-1). These activity values were up to 26 times higher than those obtained using other substrates, namely, sinigrin, glucosinalbin, glucotropaeolin, progoitrin, and glucoraphenin. Crambe myrosinase is unusual in that, unlike other Brassicaceae containing a typical main glucosinolate, it does not show the same specificity toward its natural substrates. 3aCrambe abyssinica 3athioglucosidase 3aenzyme activity 3aglucosinolates 3avarieties 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimals 2aBrassicaceaexenzymology 2aGlucosinolatesxmetabolism 2aGlycoside Hydrolasesxanalysis 2aHydrolysis 2aNutritive Value 2aSolubility 2aSpecies Specificity 2aSubstrate Specificity 0asubstrates 0aepiprogoitrin1 aIori, R.1 aPalmieri, S.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2001 Feb., v. 49, no. 2 p.840-845x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf000917h3Available from publisher's Web site  a20020301b20020307c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle02296naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100001400156245007000170300001600240520076400256650002301020650001101043650001401054650001101068650001001079650001401089650003101103650005101134650001601185650001401201650004101215650007001256650001101326650003101337650001601368653001201384653002001396653002001416653001901436700001401455700002101469700001401490700001701504773010001521852000901621856007701630930003301707945001301740946001301753655001201766IND2324803120221117234933.0020114e200102  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232480312DNAL7 a112620332pmid7 a10.1021/jf000853a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDoyen, K.10aVolatile release from an emulsion: headspace and in-mouth studies  ap. 804-810.  aThe headspace concentrations of three esters above solutions containing emulsified lipids were more resistant to dilution by a stream of gas than those above water alone. The effect was greatest for ethyl octanoate, and least for ethyl butyrate, with ethyl hexanoate showing intermediate behavior. This correlated with their solubility in the lipid fraction of the emulsion. Headspace analysis (comparing the emulsion with water) underestimated the release of the esters during consumption. The ratios observed between water and emulsion systems were different for the maximum breath concentration compared with headspace analysis. The emulsion appears to have acted as a reservoir for volatile release, counteracting the effects of sample dilution by saliva. 3avolatile compounds 3aesters 3aemulsions 3alipids 3amouth 3aingestion 2aAdministration, Inhalation 2aCarboxylic Acidsxchemistryxpharmacokinetics. 2aCitric Acid 2aEmulsions 2aEstersxchemistryxpharmacokinetics. 2aGum Arabicxadministration & dosagexchemistryxpharmacokinetics. 2aHumans 2aMass Spectrometryxmethods 2aSorbic Acid 0arelease 0aethyl octanoate 0aethyl hexanoate 0aethyl butyrate1 aCarey, M.1 aLinforth, R.S.T.1 aMarin, M.1 aTaylor, A.J.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2001 Feb., v. 49, no. 2 p.804-810x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf000853a3Available from publisher's Web site  a20020301b20020307c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle03318naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002800110040001800138100001900156245011800175300001800293500001500311520161300326650002001939650001001959650001601969650001401985650001501999650001802014650002302032650002202055650001902077650001202096650001302108650003802121650005002159650001102209650005902220650004902279650001502328650001602343650004302359650005702402653000902459653003702468653002002505700001702525773007602542852000902618856007802627930003302705945001302738946001302751655001202764IND2037569120221117234845.0940228e199311  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203756912DNAL7 a82654982pmid7 a10.3382/ps.07220952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSpurlock, M.E.10aEffect of dietary protein and selected antioxidants on fatty liver hemorrhagic syndrome induced in Japanese quail  ap. 2095-2105.  a2019-12-04  aThe effects of CP and antioxidants on fatty liver hemorrhagic syndrome (FLHS) in Japanese quail hens were studied. In Experiment 1, four treatments were arranged as a 2 x 2 factorial; dietary CP (18 or 24%) and reduced glutathione (GSH, 0 or 120 mg/kg diet) were the major variables, but cysteine and other amino acids were higher in the 24% CP diets. Negative control (NC1) and positive control (PC1) diets were also evaluated. In Experiment 2, the effects of vitamin E (VE) and GSH were evaluated in the presence and absence of adequate dietary sulfur amino acids., Negative control (NC2) and positive control (PC2) diets were used. In both experiments, liver hemorrhage was most severe in quail fed the diets that were formulated to induce hepatic steatosis and limit oxidant defense capability. Liver hemorrhage was least severe in quail fed the diets that were formulated to minimize liver lipid accumulation and support oxidant defenses. Histological evaluation of affected quail livers showed changes consistent with FLHS in chicken hens. In Experiment 1, neither CP concentration nor GSH supplementation influenced liver hemorrhage. In Experiment 2, liver hemorrhagic score was reduced from 3.8 to 2.7 (P less than or equal to.05) by adding VE to the basal diet. The PC2 diet further depressed liver score to only 2.0 (P less than or equal to .05). The data clearly show that Japanese quail are susceptible to FLHS and indicate that a combination of lipotropic and antioxidant nutrients is protective against hemorrhage, even when lipogenic demands are maximized by feeding diets devoid of added fat. 3adietary protein 3aliver 3aglutathione 3avitamin E 3aegg weight 3acrude protein 3alaying performance 3aCoturnix japonica 3ahistopathology 2aAnimals 2aCoturnix 2aDietary Proteinsxadverse effects 2aFatty Liverxetiologyxpathologyxveterinary. 2aFemale 2aGlutathionexadministration & dosagexadverse effects. 2aHemorrhagexetiologyxpathologyxveterinary. 2aOrgan Size 2aOviposition 2aPoultry Diseasesxetiologyxpathology. 2aVitamin Exadministration & dosagexadverse effects. 0adiet 0afatty liver hemorrhagic syndrome 0aJapanese quails1 aSavage, J.E.0 tPoultry science.g1993 Nov., v. 72, no. 11 p.2095-2105x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps.07220953Available from publisher's Web site  a19940415b19940418c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle03346naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100001600156245011700172300001600289500001500305520159100320650002301911650001601934650002101950650001801971650001601989650002202005650001802027650001502045650002402060650001202084650001302096650002002109650002002129650001002149650002702159650002502186650002802211650002402239650002302263650002002286650002202306650002902328650002202357650002102379653001502400653002302415700001702438700001402455700001802469773010002487852000902587856007702596930003302673945001302706946001302719655001202732IND2324834220221117234808.0020115e200102  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232483422DNAL7 a112620512pmid7 a10.1021/jf00053172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShahidi, F.10aNutrient distribution and phenolic antioxidants in air-classified fractions of beach pea (Lathyrus maritimus L.)  ap. 926-933.  a2019-12-04  aBeach pea (Lathyrus maritimus L.) cotyledons and hulls were air-classified into different fractions. The crude protein content (%N x 6.25) of samples ranged from 32.8 to 35.3% in cotyledons and 14.7 to 16.8% in hulls. Crude fiber content was higher in hulls fraction 1 (37.13%) and fraction 2 (36.85%) than in cotyledons (2.83, 2.99, and 3.08% in fractions 1, 2, and 3, respectively). Condensed tannins of cotyledons ranged from 5.76 to 6.90% and of hulls ranged from 52.49 to 57.24%, expressed as catechin equivalents. Minerals, namely P, K, and Zn, were higher in cotyledons, but Ca and Mn were more prevalent in hulls. Nonprotein nitrogen was concentrated in hulls, whereas phytic acid was more abundant in the cotyledons. The UV absorption pattern showed that flavonoids were present in fractions (I-III) from hulls separated on Sephadex LH-20. Fraction III from hulls had the highest content of total phenolics and condensed tannins, but no condensed tannins were detected in fractions I and II from hulls. The antioxidant activity of fractions separated on Sephadex LH-20 from hulls and crude extracts in a beta-carotene-linoleate model system was in the order of fraction III > crude extract > fraction II > fraction I. Spots on silica gel TLC plates, sprayed with a solution of beta-carotene and linoleic acid, indicated that many of the individual compounds were antioxidative in nature. Further, separation of fraction III from hulls on a semipreparative HPLC showed the presence of (+) catechin and (-) epicatechin as the main low-molecular-weight phenolic compounds present. 3aLathyrus japonicus 3aepicatechin 3anutrient content 3afractionation 3aphytic acid 3aproanthocyanidins 3afiber content 3acotyledons 3anonprotein nitrogen 3atannins 3aair flow 3aprotein content 3amineral content 3ahulls 2aAntioxidantsxanalysis 2aCotyledonxchemistry 2aDietary Fiberxanalysis 2aFabaceaexchemistry 2aMineralsxanalysis 2aNutritive Value 2aPhenolsxanalysis 2aPlant Proteinsxanalysis 2aPlants, Medicinal 2aSeedsxchemistry 0aflavonoids 0aphenolic compounds1 aChavan, U.D.1 aNaczk, M.1 aAmarowicz, R.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2001 Feb., v. 49, no. 2 p.926-933x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf00053173Available from publisher's Web site  a20020301b20020307c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle01972naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120100001900138245008900157300001800246520099100264650000901255650002201264650001501286650002101301650001301322650001501335650001401350700001601364700002001380773007601400852000901476856007801485930003301563945001301596946001301609655001201622IND2037564420221117234849.0940228e199311  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203756442DNAL7 a10.3382/ps.07220382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbdallah, A.G.10aVarious methods of measuring shell quality in relation to percentage of cracked eggs  ap. 2038-2043.  aAn experiment was conducted to study the relationships among percentage of cracked eggs and percentage shell, shell weight per unit surface area (SWUSA), specific gravity, egg weight, or shell weight. A total of 2,325 eggs were collected from four different flocks of Hy-Line W36 hens. Eggs were weighed, and specific gravity was measured by flotation method using increments of .001. The eggs were passed across a small grading machine three times to apply stress to the shells. Then the eggs were candled, broken out, and shell with membranes weighed. Correlation coefficients and simple and multiple regression equations were calculated. Highly negative correlations were found between percentage of cracked eggs and percentage of shell, SWUSA, specific gravity, and shell weight. However, a positive correlation was found between percentage of cracked eggs and egg weight. Because of the errors involved in specific gravity determination, percentage shell or SWUSA is more accurate. 3aeggs 3aegg shell quality 3aegg weight 3aspecific gravity 3acracking 3aprediction 3aequations1 aHarms, R.H.1 aEl-Husseiny, O.0 tPoultry science.g1993 Nov., v. 72, no. 11 p.2038-2043x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps.07220383Available from publisher's Web site  a19940415b19940418c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle02926naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002800110040001800138100001600156245007700172300001800249520151000267650001201777650001201789650001801801650002301819650002001842650001501862650001401877650000901891650002501900650001601925650001201941650004601953650004801999650004602047650001402093650003302107650001102140650002602151650001702177700001602194773007602210852000902286856007802295930003302373945001302406946001302419655001202432IND2037147620221117234825.0940207e199309  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203714762DNAL7 a82341232pmid7 a10.3382/ps.07216412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHawes, R.O.14aThe efficacy of using prelay and early-lay rations for brown-egg pullets  ap. 1641-1649.  aExperiments were conducted using two brown-egg strains to determine whether additional calcium or CP is required by these pullets prior to sexual maturity (prelay) and whether increased CP during the early part of production (early lay) would improve overall performance. In Experiment 1, the prelay treatments were arranged as a 2 X 3 factorial arrangement with two levels of CP (15 or 17%) and three levels of calcium (.9, 1.8, or 3.5%) and given to the pullets from 18 to 20 wk of age. From 20 to 26 wk of age, pullets were given either a 17 or 19% CP ration with 3.5% calcium resulting in a total of 12 treatments. There were no significant effects of the prelay or early-lay rations on eggs per hen housed, hen-day percentage production (HDP), or feed efficiency. Egg weight was significantly improved using the 17%-prelay ration at 26, 28, and 31 wk of age, but adversely affected by the higher levels of CP in the early-lay ration at 28 and 31 wk of age. Increasing calcium in the prelay ration had only minimal effects on egg size distribution. Experiment 2 consisted of a 3 X 2 factorial arrangement of treatments with three levels of prelay CP (15, 17, or 19%) and two levels of early-lay CP (17 or 19%) and given to the pullets from 18 to 20 and 20 to 41 wk of age, respectively. There was a significant improvement in HDP from 30 to 41 wk of age using the 19% CP prelay ration.

Roots of 15-day-old seedlings were treated with PEG, and leaves were studied. With the duration of PEG treatment, changes in the lipid peroxidation and activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase, peroxidase, and glutathione reductase as well as contents of hydrogen peroxide and beta-N-oxalyl-L-alpha,beta-diaminopropionic acid (ODAP) were assayed. The results indicate that with the duration of PEG treatment, activities of superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, and catalase decreased, whereas contents of hydrogen peroxide and ODAP, extent of lipid peroxidation, and activity of glutathione reductase increased. Both diethyldithiocarbamate and aminotriazole strongly inhibit activities of superoxide dismutase and catalase, respectively. At same time, the extent of lipid peroxidation was obviously increased. However, mannitol decreased the extent of lipid peroxidation. Diethyldithiocarbamate, aminotriazole, and mannitol do not affect the accumulation of ODAP. The observations suggest that there is no direct relationship between the accumulation of ODAP and the metabolism of free radicals. In addition, the relationship between water stress and ODAP accumulation in grass pea is discussed. 3aperoxidase 3aglutathione-disulfide reductase 3afree radicals 3acatalase 3aseedlings 3alipid peroxidation 3adrought tolerance 3asuperoxide dismutase 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aneurotoxins 3awater stress 3apolyethylene glycol 3aenzyme activity 3aroots 3aleaves 2aAmino Acids, Diaminoxmetabolism 2aCatalasexmetabolism 2aFabaceaexgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aFree Radicals 2aGlutathione Reductasexmetabolism 2aHydrogen Peroxidexmetabolism 2aLipid Peroxidation 2aPeroxidasexmetabolism 2aPlants, Medicinal 2aPolyethylene Glycolsxpharmacology 2aSuperoxide Dismutasexmetabolism 2aWater 0aglutathione reductase (NADPH)1 aCui, K.1 aLi, J.1 aWang, X.1 aLi, Z.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2001 Jan., v. 49, no. 1 p.216-220x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf000912k3Available from publisher's Web site  a20020501b20020507c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle01988naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120245008000138300001800218520088200236650002101118650002301139650002201162650001101184651001101195651001801206653002301224653002401247653002101271653001501292700001401307700001401321700001501335700001801350773007601368852000901444856007801453930003301531945001301564946001301577655001201590IND2043127520221117234920.0941108e199409  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204312752DNAL7 a10.3382/ps.07313702doi  aAGLbengcAGL10aFree Trade and broiler growout returns: the case of Canadian and U.S. farms  ap. 1370-1380.  aThe costs and returns associated with broiler growout production are estimated for Canadian enterprises. In view of the ongoing U.S.-Canada Free Trade agreement and the recently approved North American Free Trade Agreement, this study evaluates the profitability of Canadian broiler farms under various free market scenarios and in comparison with representative U.S. farms. A comprehensive, farm-level, capital budgeting, Monte Carlo simulation model, CHICKSIM III, was used to analyze the production and financial performance of representative broiler farms for both countries. The results show substantial differences in investment returns and profitability of broiler growout production in the U.S. and Canada. Several impact scenarios were also developed to ascertain the effect of unrestricted market access policies on the economic performance of Canadian broiler farms. 3abroiler chickens 3amarket competition 3acosts and returns 3ayields 3aCanada 3aUnited States 0abroiler production 0acomputer simulation 0amarketing boards 0afree trade1 aAlbay, F.1 aBacon, J.1 aCorman, J.1 aNarayanan, S.0 tPoultry science.g1994 Sept., v. 73, no. 9 p.1370-1380x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps.07313703Available from publisher's Web site  a19941208b19941215c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle03207naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002800110040001800138100002100156245012200177300001800299520146500317650001301782650002301795650002901818650002101847650002501868650002301893650001201916650003301928650003401961650002801995650003602023650005202059650005002111650002902161650001102190650004602201650003602247650003802283650002202321650002102343653002402364700001802388700001502406700002202421773007602443852000902519856007802528930003302606945001302639946001302652655001202665IND2037148620221117235009.0940207e199309  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203714862DNAL7 a82341282pmid7 a10.3382/ps.07216792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParmentier, H.K.10aCutaneous hypersensitivity responses in chickens divergently selected for antibody responses to sheep red blood cells  ap. 1679-1692.  aCellular immunity in vivo of chickens selected for high and low antibody responses to SRBC was evaluated by primary and secondary cutaneous hypersensitivity reactions to BSA and phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-induced delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH). Similar to PHA-induced DTH, primary and secondary cutaneous hypersensitivity to BSA comprised acute (1- and 2-h), intermediate 4- and 6-h), and late (24-h) wing web swelling responses. Primary and secondary hypersensitivity to BSA revealed line differences between the High (H) line and a randombred Control (C) line on the one hand, and the Low (L) fine on the other hand. Hypersensitivity to BSA was almost absent or decreased in the L line. The late phase of PHA-induced DTH was significantly elevated in the H line as compared with the L line. Naive recipients sensitized systematically with either serum from chickens sensitized with BSA, or with BSA-binding IgG, developed an antigen-specific early wing web swelling response following local challenge with BSA. It is suggested that the acute component of cutaneous hypersensitivity is mediated by Ig. The acute response may be a prerequisite for the development of classical (late) cutaneous DTH responses or may be initiated simultaneously with DTH. The current results indicate that the selection did not result in a higher hypersensitivity response to another T cell-dependent antigen and a mitogen in the H line, but in a lower response in the L line. 3achickens 3aantibody formation 3adelayed hypersensitivity 3abinding proteins 3aartificial selection 3aselection response 2aAnimals 2aAntibody Formationxgenetics 2aBlotting, Westernxveterinary 2aCarrier Proteinsxblood 2aChickensxgeneticsximmunology. 2aElectrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gelxveterinary 2aEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assayxveterinary 2aErythrocytesximmunology 2aFemale 2aHypersensitivityximmunologyxveterinary. 2aPhytohemagglutininsximmunology 2aSerum Albumin, Bovineximmunology 2aSheepximmunology 2aSkinximmunology 0aphytohemagglutinins1 aSchrama, J.W.1 aMeijer, F.1 aNieuwland, M.G.B.0 tPoultry science.g1993 Sept., v. 72, no. 9 p.1679-1692x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps.07216793Available from publisher's Web site  a19940305b19940310c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle03065naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002800110040001800138100001900156245010200175300001800277520132800295650002101623650002001644650002101664650001401685650001301699650002301712650002101735650001001756650002001766650002301786650001601809650002001825650001801845650005301863650001201916650003801928650002501966650002501991650000902016650004002025650005202065650003302117650002402150650003002174653002402204700002002228700001702248773007602265852000902341856007802350930003302428945001302461946001302474655001202487IND2037149120221117235013.0940207e199309  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203714912DNAL7 a82341292pmid7 a10.3382/ps.07216932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRuiz-Lopez, B.10aEffects of selected minerals on acid-base balance and tibial dyschondroplasia in broiler chickens  ap. 1693-1704.  aExperiments were conducted to determine the relative acidogenicities of several anions, including chloride, sulfate, and mono-, di-, and tribasic phosphate in commercial broiler chickens. Graded levels (80 and 160 meq/kg of diet in two experiments; 50, 100, and 150 meq/kg in a third experiment) of all anions were substituted as calcium salts on a molar equivalent basis for calcium carbonate in a semi-purified diet. All diets contained equivalent amounts of calcium. The occurrence of tibial dyschondroplasia was determined by visual scoring of the epiphyseal growth plate in the distal end of the tibiotarsus. None of the anions added to the diet at levels of 160 meq/kg or less affected body weight or feed consumption. A higher level of chloride (240 meq/kg) that was utilized in some experiments decreased weight gain by 16 to 22%. All anions except tribasic phosphate resulted in reduced blood pH or bicarbonate concentrations or both. Monobasic phosphate was more acidogenic than dibasic phosphate and sulfate and chloride was the most acidogenic of all mineral anions. All anions including tribasic phosphate increased the severity of tibial dyschondroplasia. There was no consistent relationship between blood pH, bicarbonate concentration, or partial pressure of CO2 and the severity of tibial dyschondroplasia. 3abroiler chickens 3aliveweight gain 3adietary minerals 3achlorides 3asulfates 3acalcium phosphates 3adyschondroplasia 3atibia 3ablood chemistry 3asodium bicarbonate 3afeed intake 3afeed conversion 3adose response 2aAcid-Base Equilibriumxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aAnimals 2aAnionsxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aChickensxmetabolism 2aEatingxdrug effects 2aMale 2aMineralsxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aOsteochondrodysplasiasxmetabolismxveterinary. 2aPoultry Diseasesxmetabolism 2aTibiaxdrug effects 2aWeight Gainxdrug effects 0aacid base disorders1 aRangel-Lugo, M.1 aAustic, R.E.0 tPoultry science.g1993 Sept., v. 72, no. 9 p.1693-1704x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps.07216933Available from publisher's Web site  a19940305b19940310c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle02683naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002800110040001800138100001600156245007300172300001800245500001500263520110400278650001301382650002901395650001001424650001601434650002101450650001601471650002801487650001601515650001701531650001301548650001801561650001201579650002301591650002001614650002301634650002701657650002201684650001801706650003901724650000901763650002301772650002501795653001301820653002201833653001101855700001701866773007601883852000901959856007801968930003302046945001302079946001302092655001202105IND2037148420221117234922.0940207e199309  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203714842DNAL7 a82341272pmid7 a10.3382/ps.07216732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAllen, P.C.10aEffect of atherogenic diet on chicken plasma lipids and lipoproteins  ap. 1673-1678.  a2019-12-04  aAdult male White Leghorn chickens were used in an experimental model system to study atherogenesis, and the effects of an atherogenic diet on plasma lipoprotein composition including carotenoids were determined. This model also included treatment with diazepam, a drug known to reduce formation of atherogenic plaques. After 6 wk consumption of a high-cholesterol, high-triglyceride diet, chickens had mean total plasma cholesterol, triglyceride, and carotenoid concentrations that were significantly increased over those from chicks that consumed the standard diet. Diazepam treatment had no significant effect on whole plasma concentrations of these lipids. Total body weight gain was unaffected by diet, but liver weight expressed as percentage of body weight was significantly increased in chickens that consumed the atherogenic diet. High density lipoprotein (HDL) and low density lipoprotein (LDL) fractions were isolated from plasma samples by ultracentrifugation. The atherogenic diet increased the carotenoid, cholesterol, and protein content of the LDL fractions but not the HDL fractions. 3achickens 3ahigh density lipoprotein 3aliver 3abody weight 3atriacylglycerols 3acholesterol 3alow density lipoprotein 3acarotenoids 3ablood plasma 3adiazepam 3aatherogenesis 2aAnimals 2aCarotenoidsxblood 2aChickensxblood 2aCholesterolxblood 2aDiazepamxpharmacology 2aDiet, Atherogenic 2aLipidsxblood 2aLipoproteinsxbloodxdrug effects. 2aMale 2aModels, Biological 2aTriglyceridesxblood 0aproteins 0aatherogenic diets 0aratios1 aWong, H.Y.C.0 tPoultry science.g1993 Sept., v. 72, no. 9 p.1673-1678x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps.07216733Available from publisher's Web site  a19940305b19940310c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle03442naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024002800133040001800161100001900179245012000198300001800318500002400336506007600360520155000436506003701986650001602023650001902039650001102058650001402069650001502083650000902098650001402107650001002121650003102131650001002162650001602172650001202188650002102200650003902221650003802260650005702298650002802355650001302383650004202396650005502438650002302493650002702516700001902543700001502562700001902577700002002596700003302616773011602649852000902765856007802774655001202852IND4411255620221207103654.0081010e200810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441125562DNAL7 a187911952pmid7 aPMC25611522pmcid7 a10.1093/jxb/ern2282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOlsen, Lene T.14aThe defective seed5 (des5) mutant: effects on barley seed development and HvDek1, HvCr4, and HvSal1 gene regulation  ap. 3753-3765.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBarley, one of the major small grain crops, is especially important in climatically demanding agricultural areas of the world, with multiple uses within food, feed, and beverage. The barley endosperm is further of special scientific interest due to its three aleurone cell layers, with the potential of bringing forward the molecular understanding of seed development and cell specification from Arabidopsis and maize. Work done in Arabidopsis and maize indicate the presence of conserved seed developmental pathways where Crinkly4 (Cr4), Defective kernel1 (Dek1), and Supernumerary aleurone layer1 (Sal1) are key players. With the use of microscopy, a comprehensive phenotypic characterization of the barley defective seed5 (des5) mutant is presented here. The analysis further extends to molecular quantification of gene expression changes in the des5 mutant by qRT-PCR. Moreover, full-length genomic sequences of the barley orthologues were generated and these were annotated as HvDek1, HvCr4, and HvSal1. The most striking results in this study are the patchy reduction in number of aleurone cells, rudimentary anticlinal aleurone cell walls, and the specific change of HvCr4 expression compared to HvDek1 and HvSal1. The data presented support the involvement of Hvdes5 in establishing aleurone cells. Finally, how these results might affect the current model of aleurone and epidermal cell identity and development is discussed with a speculation regarding a possible role of Des5 in regulating cell division/ secondary cell wall building.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis 3aaleurone cells 3abarley 3abeverages 3acell walls 3acorn 3aendosperm 3afeeds 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3agrain crops 3amutants 3aseed development 2aArabidopsisxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aHordeumxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutation 2aPlant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSeedsxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aStarchxmetabolism 2aTranscription, Genetic1 aDivon, Hege H.1 aAl, Ronald1 aFosnes, Kjetil1 aLid, Stein Erik1 aOpsahl-Sorteberg, Hilde-Gunn0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2008 Oct., v. 59, no. 13 p.3753-3765dOxford University Pressx0022-09577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/ern2283Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02641naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100001700156245008400173300001400257520118200271650001301453650002601466650001201492650003801504650001201542650006801554650002501622650002501647650003801672650001101710650002401721650001701745650002901762650000901791650002401800650002501824650003801849700001301887700001601900773009801916852000902014856007702023930003302100945001302133946001302146655001202159IND2325691220221117234815.0020228e200101  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232569122DNAL7 a111705622pmid7 a10.1021/jf00095962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoreno, M.J.10aProduction of monoclonal antibodies to the N-methylcarbamate pesticide propoxur  ap. 72-78.  aMonoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to the pesticide propoxur were produced from haptens with carboxylic spacer arms of different lengths introduced at the carbamate group of the analyte structure. MAbs were subsequently characterized in the conjugate-coated format using these immunizing haptens and newly synthesized compounds as homologous and heterologous assay conjugates, respectively. Appropriate combinations of immunoreagents resulted in competitive enzyme immunoassays (ELISA) with I50 values in the low nanomolar range (6.5-17.9 nM). A modification of the conjugate-coated format consisting of the simultaneous incubation of the MAb and the peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody in the presence of the analyte resulted in an assay with an I50 value of 4.4 nM. This one-step conjugate-coated ELISA format is as simple and fast as the antibody-coated format but without the need of synthesizing enzyme-hapten conjugates. Major N-methylcarbamate pesticides were not recognized by the MAb.

Greenhouse (three trials, 1992 to 1994) and field (two sites in Iowa, 1992 and 1993) experiments were conducted with one maize hybrid to examine the effect of time of soil ridging on nodal root development, internode elongation, shoot dry matter, and grain yield. Maize root clumps were evaluated from unridged plants and from plants ridged either at early Or4 to V6) or late (V7) growth stages. Total numbers of nodal roots, numbers roots per node, numbers of nodes developing functional roots, internode lengths, shoot dry matter, and grain yields (field study) were determined. Time of ridging significantly affeeted nodal root numbers and internode lengths. In two of the field trials, unridged maize plants produced 42.7 and 48.3 functional nodal roots, whereas plants ridged at growth stage V7 developed significantly more, 47.0 and 56.0 roots, respectively. Internodes 6 and 7, covered with soil during ridging, increased in length by as much as 124% in the field and 175% in the greenhouse when plants were ridged early rather than late. In one field trial, Internode 6 elongated to 44.1 mm with early ridging, but to less than 17.0 mm with either late or no ridging. Shoot dry matter and grain yields generally were not affected by ridging treatments in either field or greenhouse experiments. Later ridging tends to result in shorter internodes and more functional nodal roots which may be important to maize plants in terms of lodging resistance and recovery from corn rootworm (spp.) damage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aplant development 3aZea mays 3aroot systems 3adevelopmental stages 3ainternodes 3aridging 3adry matter accumulation 3acrop yield 3agrains 3aconservation tillage 3ashoots 3aIowa 0aridge-till system 0astems 0acrop growth stage 0agrowth rate 0atiming1 aKaspar, Thomas C.0 tAgronomy journal.g1997 Mar., v. 89, no. 2 p.195-200dAmerican Society of AgronomywJournal:jnl44592x0002-19627nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2134/agronj1997.00021962008900020008x3Available from publisher's Web site  a19971102b19971106c00000000  aINDdLJS  aOther US 7aarticle03174naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002800110040001800138100001200156245009500168300001600263520141500279650001201694650002101706650002301727650001501750650002101765650002201786650001901808650002201827650002401849650002301873650001201896650003501908650001301943650002401956650002901980650004502009650002802054650001102082650001802093650001902111650002202130650001702152650000902169650002002178650004602198650002202244700001702266700002002283700001902303700001902322773007302341852000902414856007802423930003302501945001302534946001302547655001202560IND2052746020221117234859.0960826e199604  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205274602DNAL7 a87869312pmid7 a10.3382/ps.07504392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, J.10aMeasurement of genetic parameters within and between turkey lines using DNA fingerprinting  ap. 439-446.  aAn experiment was conducted to estimate genetic parameters in six experimental and five commercial primary breeding turkey lines using DNA fingerprinting. Eighteen individual DNA samples per line were digested with an HaeIII restriction enzyme and hybridized with Jeffreys' 33.6 probe. The DNA fingerprints were analyzed with computer programs to measure band sharing (BS) and band frequencies. Within lines, BS ranged from 0.39 to 0.62 and reflected the history of the experimental lines. Among lines, BS ranged from 0.21 to 0.33 with an average of 0.26. The BS among the experimental lines reflected known relationships. All lines were subdivided based on indices of population subdivision. About 26 hypervariable loci were estimated from band frequencies. Average heterozygosity and genetic variability estimated from band frequencies were significantly different among lines and displayed a result very similar to the BS among lines. Genetic distance indices among lines were also significantly different and reflected known relationships between the experimental lines. The experimental selected lines displayed lower genetic diversity than did the other lines. The parameters measuring genetic diversity within lines had higher correlation coefficients among them than did the parameters between lines. The computer program used in this study made DNA fingerprinting easier to use in population analysis. 3aturkeys 3aline differences 3aDNA fingerprinting 3aDNA probes 3agenetic distance 3agenetic variation 3aheterozygosity 3acomputer analysis 3agenetic correlation 3aselection criteria 2aAnimals 2aBlotting, Southernxveterinary 2aBreeding 2aComputer Simulation 2aDNAxanalysisxgenetics. 2aDNA Fingerprintingxmethodsxveterinary. 2aDNA Restriction Enzymes 2aFemale 2aGene Deletion 2aGene Frequency 2aGenetic Variation 2aHeterozygote 2aMale 2aModels, Genetic 2aPolymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length 2aTurkeysxgenetics1 aNestor, K.E.1 aPatterson, R.A.1 aJackwood, D.J.1 aEmmerson, D.A.0 tPoultry science.g1996 Apr., v. 75, no. 4 p.439-446x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps.07504393Available from publisher's Web site  a19961002b19961007c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle03277naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002800110040001800138100001400156245009700170300001600267500001500283520169900298650002301997650002402020650001902044650001502063650001402078650002302092650001802115650000902133650002302142650001002165650005302175650001202228650003302240650001302273650005802286650002002344650001102364650001302375650002002388650000902408650001402417650002802431650002302459653002202482773007302504852000902577856007802586930003302664945001302697946001302710655001202723IND2052746520221117234747.0960826e199604  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205274652DNAL7 a87869322pmid7 a10.3382/ps.07504472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMuir, Wm.10aGroup selection for adaptation to multiple-hen cages: selection program and direct responses  ap. 447-458.  a2019-12-04  aA selection experiment was initiated with a synthetic line of White Leghorns in 1982 to improve adaptability and well-being of layers in large multiple-bird cages by use of a selection procedure termed "group selection". With this procedure, each sire family was housed as a group in a multiple-bird cage and selected or rejected as a group. An unselected control, with approximately the same number of breeders as the selected line, was maintained for comparison and housed in one-bird cages. Annual percentage mortality of the selected line in multiple-bird cages decreased from 68% in Generation (G)2 to 8.8% in G6. Percentage mortality in G6 of the selected line in multiple-bird cages was similar to that of the unselected control in one-bird cages (9.1%). Annual days survival improved from 169 to 348 d, eggs per hen per day (EHD) from 52 to 68%, eggs per hen housed from 91 to 237 eggs, and egg mass (EM) from 5.1 to 13.4 kg, whereas annual egg weight remained unchanged. The dramatic improvement in livability demonstrates that adaptability and well-being of these birds were improved by group selection. The similar survival of the selected line in multiple-bird cages and-the control in one-bird cages suggests that beak-trimming of the selected line would not further reduce mortalities, which implies that group selection may have eliminated the need to beak-trim. Corresponding improvements in EHD and EM demonstrate that such changes can also be profitable. The most surprising finding was the rate at which such improvement took place, with the majority of change in survival occurring by the third generation. However, EHD continued to improve at the rate of 4% per generation. 3aselection response 3agenetic improvement 3aanimal welfare 3aegg weight 3amortality 3alaying performance 3abeak trimming 3ahens 3aselection criteria 3acages 2aAdaptation, Physiologicalxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aAnimals 2aBehavior, Animalxphysiology 2aBreeding 2aChickensxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aEggsxstandards 2aFemale 2aGenotype 2aHousing, Animal 2aMale 2aMortality 2aOvipositionxphysiology 2aSelection, Genetic 0aselection methods0 tPoultry science.g1996 Apr., v. 75, no. 4 p.447-458x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps.07504473Available from publisher's Web site  a19961002b19961007c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle02704naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002800110040001800138100002000156245013600176300001600312520130700328650002101635650001801656650001201674650002001686650001401706650002101720650001801741650001801759650001801777650001501795650001201810650001301822650001601835650002701851650000901878650002001887650001001907653001801917653001301935653001301948700001801961773007301979852000902052856007802061930003302139945001302172946001302185655001202198IND2052925620221117235102.0960909e199606  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205292562DNAL7 a87378492pmid7 a10.3382/ps.07508092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoran, E.T.

Treatments were factorially arranged among the populations of 32 pens (24 birds per pen) that had been reared under common conditions. Tumbling increased chill water uptake, abdominal fat content, and yield of whole carcasses, whereas no differences occurred as a result of the stunning treatments. Carcasses were separated into a nine-piece cut immediately after chilling. All parts lost weight from weepage during the subsequent 24 h, and weep from total parts was greater when carcasses had been tumbled than held static. Keel portion breast and drumsticks continued a weight advantage from water uptake with tumble chilling, but wings, thighs, and split breast lost this additional water and were similar to those respective parts static chilled. High stunning current led to an increased amount of keel portion breast, regardless of chilling treatment, with subsequent weep not being affected. Alterations in yield that occur because of chilling procedure are substantial and not equivalent among parts, whereas stunning has little impact and is focused on the breast. 3abroiler chickens 3acarcass yield 3acooling 3afood processing 3ameat cuts 3aelectric current 3abreast muscle 3aabdominal fat 3afat thickness 2aAbsorption 2aAnimals 2aChickens 2aElectricity 2aFood Handlingxmethods 2aMale 2aMeatxstandards 2aWater 0aweight losses 0astunning 0atumbling1 aBilgili, S.F.0 tPoultry science.g1996 June, v. 75, no. 6 p.809-812x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps.07508093Available from publisher's Web site  a19961002b19961007c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle02134naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100001800161245007500179300001600254520095600270650001101226650001601237650002301253650001501276650001901291650002601310650001801336650001701354650002001371650001201391650001401403650002201417650002201439653002301461653002201484700001801506773008601524852000901610930003301619945002501652946001101677655001201688IND4362573220221117234849.0040519e200409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436257322DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aLewicki, P.P.10aEffect of hot air temperature on mechanical properties of dried apples  ap. 307-314.  aThe aim of this work was to determine the effect of temperature and water content on the mechanical properties of convection dried apples. Apples v. Idared were cut into slices and then air-dried at temperature in the range from 50 to 80 °C. Mechanical properties were measured by compression¡relaxation test. Samples were investigated after drying and also after 5 weeks of storage over anhydrous calcium chloride at constant temperature. Analysis showed that the observed differences between compression¡relaxation curves of apples dried at 50, 60 and 70 °C were not significant. Decreasing of water content caused an increase of force needed to compress dried apples. Drying at 80 °C affected the texture of dried apples much more in comparison to those obtained at lower hot air temperature. The use of suitable temperature and drying of apples to definite water content could be used to design the mechanical properties of the final product. 3aapples 3adried fruit 3adrying temperature 3aair drying 3adrying quality 3amechanical properties 3awater content 3afood storage 3astorage quality 3atexture 3ashrinkage 3amechanical stress 3astress relaxation 0acompression stress 0aconvection drying1 aJakubczyk, E.0 tJournal of food engineering.g2004 Sept., v. 64, no. 3 p.307-314x0260-87747nnas  aDNAL  a20040526b00000000c00000000  aINDdHBIe2004/05/26  aNon-US 7aarticle02042naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001300144245008800157300001400245520083500259650002601094650001401120650001301134650001201147650001501159650002201174650002201196650001301218650001201231650002801243650001501271650001601286650001501302650001601317650001501333650001301348650002301361700001501384700001201399773008301411852000901494930003301503945002501536946001101561655001201572IND4362955620221117234910.0040622e200411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436295562DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aBera, D.10aKinetic studies on bleaching of edible oil using charred sawdust as a new adsorbent  ap. 33-36.  aA new and low cost acid hydrolyzed charred sawdust as an adsorbent has been used for the purification of edible oils. The maximum colouring matter adsorbed γp(m) (mg/m2) for different oils on sawdust has been calculated. The change in free energy -deltaG x 10(-1) (kJ/ mol) due to adsorption of colouring matter from the bulk to the interface of the sawdust has been calculated. From our result it has been found that the maximum adsorption has been comparable to the change in free energy. The thermodynamic parameters such as the activation energy, enthalpy, and entropy are presented. The negative value of deltaS indicates less disorder i.e. the crude oil contains more colourant and impurities before bleaching process and these are decreased during adsorption process because disorder is directly proportional with entropy. 3acooking fats and oils 3ableaching 3acharcoal 3asawdust 3aabsorbents 3aactivation energy 3aGibbs free energy 3aenthalpy 3aentropy 3afood processing quality 3asesame oil 3amustard oil 3aspice oils 3atemperature 3aadsorption 3akinetics 3acost effectiveness1 aLahiri, D.1 aNag, A.0 tJournal of food engineering.g2004 Nov., v. 65, no. 1 p.33-36x0260-87747nnas  aDNAL  a20041203b00000000c00000000  aINDdPNNe2004/12/03  aNon-US 7aarticle01883naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001600127245005300143300001600196500001500212520092000227650002701147650001601174650002001190650001201210650001201222650001101234650001201245650001301257650001101270653002701281700001401308700001201322773008501334852000901419930003301428945002501461946001101486655001201497IND4362893820221117234749.0040615e200410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436289382DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Magnitudes of G' increased sharply during cooling (from 95 to 4 °C) and decreased with increase in concentration of sugar. The xylose was found to show the greatest reduction in the values of G' among the sugars tested. G' values as a function of aging time (10 h) at 4 °C increased rapidly at initial stage and then reach a pseudoplateau region at long aging times. Increasing the sugar concentration resulted in the decrease in pseudoplateau values. In general, G' values in corn starch-sugar composites were reduced in the presence of sugars, and decreased in the following order: xylose > sucrose > glucose > control (no sugar). 3achemical concentration 3acorn starch 3astorage modulus 3aglucose 3asucrose 3axylose 3acooling 3agelation 3apastes 0arheological properties1 aLim, S.T.1 aYoo, B.0 tJournal of food engineering.g2004 Oct., v. 64, no. 4 p.521-527x0260-87747nnas  aDNAL  a20050209b20050301c00000000  aINDdHBIe2005/02/09  aNon-US 7aarticle01809naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100002100144245007700165300001600242500001500258520080200273650002401075650002101099650002401120650001401144650001101158650001801169650001101187650001101198653001701209653001401226700002001240773008501260852000901345930003301354945002501387946001101412655001201423IND4362893720221117234913.0040615e200410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436289372DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

After testing different concentrations of the reagents, and time of exposure into the reagent method 2C was chosen. It used an alkaline mix of sodium hypochlorite 5.25% solution and 50 g KOH. As a result, an easy and quick method to isolate white starch from dark sorghum is reported. Percent of purity of the isolated starch from dark seed samples were compared to that exhibited by starch isolated from white sorghum grains, and slight differences between the isolates were recorded. These differences were attributed to the unequal isolation methods and/or varietal differences. The yield of the starch from dark seed samples was 30 ± 1%. 3apotassium hydroxide 3asodium bisulfite 3asodium hypochlorite 3ableaching 3apurity 3agrain sorghum 3astarch 3ayields 0adark sorghum 0aisolation1 aLares Amaiz, M.0 tJournal of food engineering.g2004 Oct., v. 64, no. 4 p.515-519x0260-87747nnas  aDNAL  a20050209b20050301c00000000  aINDdHBIe2005/02/09  aNon-US 7aarticle02382naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100002400127245010100151300001600252520117300268650002201441650002601463650001201489650002301501650002701524650002401551650002201575650001601597650001801613650001901631650002901650650002001679650001901699653001701718700001601735700001501751700001901766773008501785852000901870930003301879945002501912946001101937655001201948IND4362891120221117234757.0040615e200410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436289112DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The effect of the initial ammonium concentration on laccase activity was also studied. Operating with barley bran at an initial ammonium concentration of 0.2 g/l, laccase activities were enhanced by 13-fold in relation to inert support cultures. Secondly, laccase production by T. versicolor and the newly isolated Trametes hirsuta grown on barley bran was improved by supplementing the cultures with 2,5-xylidine and copper sulphate. Thus, laccase from T. hirsuta cultures supplemented with both 1 mM copper sulphate and 2 mM xylidine was enhanced 5-fold. Finally, the in vitro decolourisation of several synthetic dyes by the extracellular liquid produced by T. hirsuta cultures was carried out. Decolourisation was more effective at pH 4 than 5. High decolourisation percentages in short incubation times were achieved for Bromophenol Blue, Indigo Carmine and Methyl Orange, whereas Poly R-478 presented much more resistance to degradation. 3abiobased products 3abiological production 3alaccase 3abrewery byproducts 3afood processing wastes 3aCoriolus versicolor 3aCoriolus hirsutus 3abarley bran 3aculture media 3acopper sulfate 3asolid state fermentation 3awhite-rot fungi 3adecolorization 0a2,5-xylidine1 aRosales, E.1 aGundin, M.1 aSanroman, M.A.0 tJournal of food engineering.g2004 Oct., v. 64, no. 4 p.423-428x0260-87747nnas  aDNAL  a20050209b20050301c00000000  aINDdHBIe2005/02/09  aNon-US 7aarticle03737naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072001700164072001700181072001700198072001700215100002200232245015200254300001300406520163500419650002002054650001002074650002802084650002302112650002502135650001902160650002302179650001202202650001902214650001902233650002002252650001702272650002102289650002102310650003302331650001802364650002702382650001202409650002002421650002102441650001702462650001202479650004002491650003302531650003502564650001502599650001102614650006102625651001102686653002302697700002102720700002102741700002402762773008802786852000902874856008502883930003302968945002503001946001303026655001203039IND4436124620221117234817.0100428e201005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443612462DNAL7 a200357652pmid7 a10.1016/j.jip.2009.12.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aTrinkler, Nolwenn10aResistance to Brown Ring Disease in the Manila clam, Ruditapes philippinarum: A study of selected stocks showing a recovery process by shell repair  ap. 8-16.  aEuropean stocks of the Manila clam Ruditapes philippinarum are affected by the Brown Ring Disease (BRD), which is caused by Vibrio tapetis. BRD is characterized by an accumulation of a brown organic matrix on the inner face of the shell. Clams that recover from BRD develop a white mineralized layer covering the brown matrix. Stocks of clams that showed resistance to BRD development, as enhanced recovery, have been monitored since 2000. We have examined two selected stocks: a Low Susceptibility (LS) stock and a High Susceptibility stock (HS), over three generations. The LS stock showed less evidence of the BRD symptoms, and more evidence of total shell repair, both in the field and following experimental challenge with V. tapetis, indicating that some clams may be less vulnerable to a V. tapetis attack than others. The inner face of the valves of the LS and HS clams of the two last generations were analysed with scanning electron microscopy. Examination of shells from BRD-affected clams showed that during the repair process, calcium crystals were progressively laid down until the affected zone was entirely covered. By the end of the shell repair process, a final organic layer covered the calcium crystal mounds. This layer seemed essential in the recovery process. The results indicate that the shell repair capability of the clams is the principal mechanism implicated in the development of BRD resistance in the Manila clam stocks. However, this resistance did not increase with generation because the broodstock was maintained at a site where selection pressure was low, due to a low prevalence of V. tapetis. 3amollusc culture 3aclams 3aRuditapes philippinarum 3ashellfish diseases 3abacterial infections 3aVibrio tapetis 3adisease resistance 3astrains 3abreeding lines 3abreeding stock 3ain vivo studies 3apathogenesis 3adisease severity 3aanimal pathology 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atissue repair 3abiochemical mechanisms 3acalcium 3acrystallization 3ashell (molluscs) 3aheritability 2aAnimals 2aBivalviaximmunologyxmicrobiology. 2aImmunity, Innateximmunology 2aMicroscopy, Electron, Scanning 2aPrevalence 2aVibrio 2aVibrio Infectionsxepidemiologyximmunologyxveterinary. 3aEurope 0abrown ring disease1 aSinquin, Gérard1 aQuerne, Jérémy1 aPaillard, Christine0 tJournal of invertebrate pathology.g2010 May, v. 104, no. 1 p.8-16x0022-20117nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jip.2009.12.0073Available from publisher's Web site  a20100701b20100703c00000000  aINDd4CTe2010/05/29  aOther US 7aarticle03098naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002400152245013700176300001600313520191400329653002202243653004002265653002102305653002802326653002602354653003002380700001602410700002202426700002102448700002002469700001602489773013102505852000902636856009202645946001102737655001202748IND4439605420221117234817.0100709e201008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443960542DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2605.2009.00997.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aElzinga-Tinke, J.E.14aThe predictive value of testicular ultrasound abnormalities for carcinoma in situ of the testis in men at risk for testicular cancer  ap. 597-603.  aTesticular microlithiasis (TM) is sometimes observed during scrotal ultrasound examinations in men. It has been suggested that TM is more prevalent in testes of men at risk for testicular carcinoma in situ (CIS), the precursor cells of all testicular germ cell tumours (TGCT). We have performed a retrospective analysis of ultrasound images and additional clinical data of a selected cohort of men and have determined the risk factor of TM and other ultrasound abnormalities for testicular CIS. Between 2002 and 2007, 176 testicular biopsies were performed in men with abnormalities found on the scrotal ultrasound. TM was found in 76/176 men (43.2%) and CIS was diagnosed in 20 of these men (26.3%). Here, we focused on the group of 76 men with TM to determine additional risk factors, besides TM, for CIS. In both groups, those with and without CIS, reproductive hormones, scrotal ultrasound images and patient history were compared. Predictive ultrasound findings for CIS were TM (sensitivity 100%, 95% CI: 0.8-1.0; specificity 64.1%, 95% CI: 0.6-0.7; PPV 26.3%, 95% CI: 0.2-0.4) and within this group an inhomogeneous testicular parenchyma (OR 16.1, 95% CI 2.4-106.8; sensitivity 75.0%, 95% CI: 0.5-0.9; specificity 79.0%, 95% CI: 0.7-0.9; PPV 50.0%, 95% CI: 0.3-0.7). Other significantly ultrasound characteristics for CIS in this population with TM were clusters of TM (p = 0.02) and intra-testicular lesions (p = 0.01). Men with CIS were found to have significantly lower values of inhibin-B (p = 0.02). Clusters of TM, intra-testicular lesions and lower values of inhibin-B were not significantly different in logistic regression analysis. TM on scrotal ultrasound of men with risk factors for TGCT and men with clinical signs of testicular maldevelopment has a high predictive value for CIS.

ATP leaked or released by damaged cells triggers microglial activation through P2 receptors, and stimulates the release of oxygen radicals, proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines from activated microglia. However, little is known about mechanisms underlying ATP-induced chemokine release from microglia. In this study, we found that a high concentration of ATP induces the mRNA expression and release of CXCL2 from microglia. A similar effect was observed following treatment of microglia with a P2X7 receptor (P2X7R) agonist, 2′-and 3′-O-(4-benzoylbenzoyl) ATP, and this was inhibited by pre-treatment with a P2X7R antagonist, Brilliant Blue G. ATP induced both activation of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) and MAPKs (p38, ERK, and JNK) through P2X7R. ATP-induced mRNA expression of CXCL2 was inhibited by INCA-6 (an NFAT inhibitor), SB203580 (a p38 inhibitor), U0126 (a MEK-ERK inhibitor) and JNK inhibitor II (a JNK inhibitor). However, MAPK inhibitors did not inhibit activation of NFAT. In addition, protein kinase C inhibitors suppressed ATP-induced ERK and JNK activation, and also inhibited ATP-induced CXCL2 expression in microglia. These results suggest that ATP increased CXCL2 production via both NFAT and protein kinase C/MAPK signaling pathways through P2X7 receptor stimulation in microglia. 3aneuroglia 2aAdenosine Triphosphatexanalogs & derivativesxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aAnimals 2aCell Line 2aChemokine CXCL2xbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aMAP Kinase Signaling Systemxphysiology 2aMice 2aMicrogliaxmetabolismxpathology. 2aNFATC Transcription Factorsxphysiology 2aProtein Kinase Cxmetabolism 2aPurinergic P2 Receptor Agonists 2aRats 2aReceptors, Purinergic P2xmetabolismxphysiology. 2aReceptors, Purinergic P2X7 2aUp-Regulationxphysiology 0aATP 0achemokine 0aCXCL2 0aP2X7 0arelease1 aTozaki-Saitoh, Hidetoshi1 aYoshitake, Mai1 aTsuda, Makoto1 aInoue, Kazuhide0 tJournal of neurochemistry.g2010 Aug., v. 114, no. 3 p.810-819dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0022-30427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1471-4159.2010.06809.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100709b20100807c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02307naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002400152245009500176300001600271520125900287650001701546653001401563653002101577653002601598653003801624653003801662700002301700773012301723852000901846856009201855930003301947946001301980655001201993IND4439599520221117234839.0100709e201008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443959952DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1471-4159.2010.06813.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCorso-Díaz, Ximena10anNOSα and nNOSβ localization to aggresome-like inclusions is dependent on HSP90 activity  ap. 864-872.  aJ. Neurochem. (2010) 114, 864-872. Nitric oxide (NO) is a highly reactive gas that participates in many physiological processes including neuroplasticity and neuronal survival. In brain neurons, NO is produced by two variants of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), nNOSα and nNOSβ. The activity of nNOSα is tightly regulated at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. Heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) regulates nNOSα activity by facilitating heme insertion into the nNOSα monomer, resulting in increased NO production. HSP90 also regulates nNOSα degradation through the proteasome pathway. Here, we show in vitro that inhibition of HSP90 with geldanamycin increases nNOS mobility and induces formation of aggresome-like inclusions containing both nNOSα and nNOSβ in primary cortical neurons. We also report the formation of endogenous nNOS-containing aggresome-like inclusions in healthy, untreated, mature primary cortical neurons. We propose that nNOS aggregation may be an additional mechanism for regulating nNOS activity, as has been proposed for inducible nitric oxide synthase. These findings reveal a new role for HSP90 in regulating nNOS sub-cellular localization and underscore the complexity of nNOS regulatory mechanisms. 3anitric oxide 0aaggresome 0acortical neurons 0aheat shock protein 90 0aneuronal nitric oxide synthase α 0aneuronal nitric oxide synthase β1 aKrukoff, Teresa L.0 tJournal of neurochemistry.g2010 Aug., v. 114, no. 3 p.864-872dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0022-30427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1471-4159.2010.06813.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100709b20100807c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02206naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001500153245010500168300001200273500001500285520090300300592002801203650001101231650002501242650001001267650001101277650001101288650001201299650001501311650002201326650001501348650001101363650001201374650001301386650001101399653001101410653001501421653001901436653002301455653002301478653001501501700002001516773010301536856008801639852000901727655001201736IND60585846820221120080448.0190401e20180110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058584682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2017.11.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKazama, So10aEstimation of periphyton dynamics in a temperate catchment using a distributed nutrient-runoff model  ap. 1-9.  a2019-12-06  aThis study develops a model to estimate the spatiotemporal distribution of stream algae on a basin scale by integrating an existing periphyton model into a distributed hydrothermal model to calculate the daily periphyton biomass throughout the Natori River basin. The influence of inorganic phosphorus on periphyton growth is incorporated into the periphyton model. The inorganic phosphorus concentration is simulated using the distributed pollute model depending on land use data to determine the phosphorus load. The model had a root mean square error (RMSE)=14.1mg/m2 for periphyton biomass in the entire basin. This model shows that periphyton biomass tends to increase in the summer season with high water temperature and to decrease in the spring season with high discharge. This model can be applied to understand large spatial and temporal areas of the environment in a temperate catchment.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3ainorganic phosphorus 3aalgae 3amodels 3aspring 3astreams 3awatersheds 3awater temperature 3aperiphyton 3asummer 3abiomass 3aland use 3arunoff 0aRunoff 0aPhosphorus 0aAttached algae 0aHydrothermal model 0aNatori River basin 0aphosphorus1 aWatanabe, Kengo0 tEcological modelling.g2018 Jan. 10, v. 367 p.1-9dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl6191x0304-38007nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2017.11.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03083naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245013400172300001400306520151800320592002801838650001101866650001701877650002001894650003801914650001301952650001401965650004401979650003302023650001702056650001602073650002102089653000902110653000702119653000802126653000802134653000802142653000802150653000802158653000902166653001702175653002002192653001702212653001902229653001402248700002502262700002102287700001902308700001602327773009202343856008502435852000902520655001202529IND60573098220221118194913.0190417e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057309822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foostr.2016.10.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDi Bari, Vincenzo10aCrystallisation in water-in-cocoa butter emulsions: Role of the dispersed phase on fat crystallisation and polymorphic transition  ap. 82-93.  aThe present work is one of the first to focus on the role of emulsified water droplets on the crystallisation behaviour of water-in-cocoa butter emulsions under quiescent conditions (i.e. absence of any externally applied force). Cocoa butter (CB) systems were designed to progressively increase the number of heterogeneous nuclei within the CB matrix, and the crystallisation behaviour was studied at four temperatures (5°C, 10°C, 15°C and 20°C). Information on the crystallisation kinetics and polymorphism was obtained by pulsed nuclear magnetic resonance and differential scanning calorimetry, respectively. This work provides evidence that dispersed water droplets have two key effects on the phase transition of the continuous fat phase: (1) increase the crystallisation rate and (2) enhance the polymorphic evolution. Emulsions crystallised faster (larger Avrami kinetic constant) than the bulk phase at intermediate-low levels of supercooling, although the mechanisms of nucleation did not change across systems. Moreover, at all temperatures, emulsified CB evolved faster towards more stable polymorphs. In these systems, a mechanism of ‘interfacial heterogeneous templating’ seems unlikely considering that the emulsifier (polyglycerol polyricinoleate) does not crystallise. This result was attributed to the presence of an emulsifier liquid-like layer surrounding the water droplets where the polymorphic evolution could be locally enhanced by the structural re-arrangement of CB triglycerides.  aPublisher supplied data 3abutter 3acocoa butter 3acrystallization 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3adroplets 3aemulsions 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apolyglycerol polyricinoleate 3asupercooling 3atemperature 3atriacylglycerols 0aTAGs 0aCB 0aTCr 0aDSC 0aNMR 0aO/W 0aW/O 0aPGPR 0aCocoa butter 0aCrystallisation 0aPolymorphism 0aMicrostructure 0aEmulsions1 aMacnaughtan, William1 aNorton, Jennifer1 aSullo, Antonio1 aNorton, Ian0 tFood structure.g2017 Apr., v. 12 p.82-93dElsevier LtdwJournal:23298x2213-32917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foostr.2016.10.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02584naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245013100170506010400301506007600405520107600481592002801557506003701585650001601622650002401638650001201662650001101674650002101685650002001706650001501726650001301741650002501754653002501779653002701804653003101831700001701862700001901879700001601898700002801914700002801942773010601970856005302076852000902129655001202138IND60795566320221207122800.0221004e202211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079556632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2022.1280462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSapmaz, Tugba10aPotential of food waste-derived volatile fatty acids as alternative carbon source for denitrifying moving bed biofilm reactors  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aFossil-based materials such as methanol are frequently used in the denitrification process of advanced biological wastewater treatment as external carbon source.

In this study, the effectiveness of food waste-derived VFAs (AD-VFA) was investigated in the post-denitrification process in comparison with synthetic VFA and methanol as carbon sources. Acetic acid had the highest rate of disappearance among single tested VFAs with a denitrification rate of 0.44 g NOₓ-N removed/m²/day, indicating a preferential utilization pattern. While AD-VFA had a denitrification rate of 0.61 mg NOₓ-N removed/m²/day, sVFA had a rate of 0.57 mg NOₓ-N removed/m²/day, indicating that impurities in AD-VFA did not play substantial role in denitrification.

In this study, the antioxidant activity of methanolic crude extracts of transgenic and non-transgenic control plants was investigated using the 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging method. Free radical scavenging activity was evaluated using α-tocopherol and butylated hydroxyl toluene as standard antioxidants. In general, the ethyl acetate fraction of transgenic P. frutescens showed stronger DPPH radical scavenging activity than the ethyl acetate fraction from non-transgenic control plants (IC₅₀ 2.00 ± 0.10 and 5.53 ± 0.40 μg∙ml⁻¹, respectively). High-performance liquid chromatography analysis of phenolic acids in leaf extracts confirmed increased levels of 16 individual phenolic compounds in two transgenic lines (pf47-5 and pf47-8) compared with control plants. Changes in the phenolic compound profile and α-tocopherol content were correlated with the antioxidant properties of transgenic plants, indicating that the introduction of transgene γ-tmt influenced the metabolism of phenolic compounds and subsequently produced biochemical changes in the transformants. There were no significant differences in photosynthetic rate in the transgenic plants as compared to the non-transgenic control plants, suggesting that the alteration of phenolic compounds and tocopherol composition had little impact on photosynthesis.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aPerilla frutescens 3aalpha-tocopherol 3aantioxidant activity 3aethyl acetate 3afree radical scavengers 3agamma-tocopherol 3agene overexpression 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3aleaf extracts 3amethyltransferases 3aphenolic acids 3aphotosynthesis 3atoluene 3atransgenes 3atransgenic plants1 aSeong, Eun Soo1 aLee, Chan Ok1 aLee, Jae Geun1 aYu, Chang Yeon1 aKim, Seung-Hyun,1 aChung, Ill Min0 tProtoplasma.g2015 Sept., v. 252, no. 5 p.1285-1290dSpringer Viennax0033-183X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00709-015-0760-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02200naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245012600171300001800297520098800315592002801303650004401331650001401375650001501389650002501404650001301429650001101442650004001453650002301493650002501516650002601541650000901567700002101576700002301597773011601620856008101736852000901817655001201826IND60152192020221121095108.0150529e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6015219202DNAL7 a10.1007/s00253-014-6371-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJavalkote, Vivek S.10aScrutinizing the influence of UV radiation on adsorption behavior of zinc metal on marine diatom Nitzschia sp.

Nitzschia sp. was isolated from marine habitat and gradually acclimatized to UVA, UVB, and zinc (30 mg/L). The culture was subjected to various concentrations of zinc (5, 10, 15, 20 mg/L) with an artificial exposure of PAR, PAR + UVA, and PAR + UVB radiation. The adsorption isotherm models were applied for validating the hypothesis stating the association of zinc adsorption with exposure to ultraviolet radiation. Altered functional groups on the surface were observed in the FTIR spectra along with changes in antioxidant activity, superoxide dismutase activity, pigment and protein contents due to increased zinc concentration and ultraviolet radiation. Scanning electron micrographs (SEM-EDAX) supported the microscopic morphology of adsorbed metals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aNitzschia 3aadsorption 3aantioxidant activity 3ahabitats 3amodels 3aphotosynthetically active radiation 3asorption isotherms 3asuperoxide dismutase 3aultraviolet radiation 3azinc1 aZawar, Prachi A.1 aPuranik, Pravin R.0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2015 June, v. 99, no. 12 p.5269-5280dSpringer-Verlagx0175-75987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-014-6371-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03108naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245007900165300001500244520179400259592002802053650001002081650001002091650001502101650001602116650001002132650001202142650001702154650001102171650001002182650001502192651001102207653001702218653001402235653001702249653003402266653002302300700002202323700002602345700002102371773012002392856008102512856004802593852000902641655001202650IND60126971820221119224127.0150428e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012697182DNAL7 a10.2993/0278-0771-34.1.842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMadej, Tomasz10aJuniper Beer in Poland: The Story of the Revival of a Traditional Beverage  ap. 84-103.  aLow-alcohol beverages made of juniper pseudo-fruits were once common in parts of northern and northeastern Poland. The aim of this article is to investigate the history of juniper beer production, its role in local communities, changes in recipes, and signs of revival of the tradition. Archival ethnographic sources from all over the country were reviewed, and field research was carried out in two juniper beer producing areas in the Northeast region: (1) Kurpie, and (2) Podlasie. Juniper beers were made in central and northeastern Poland, mainly for weddings, holidays, or other special occasions. The tradition gradually declined throughout the twentieth century and has now practically disappeared. Juniper beer, however, recently has been popularized in the Kurpie region as a regional specialty, aimed at visitors to the area since the 1990s. The beverage is gaining increasing media attention, not only in the region but across Poland, and it is now produced in a large proportion of households in Kurpie (either for sale or for domestic use). In Podlasie, juniper beer is still mainly remembered as a drink from the past, with very few individuals still making it. Juniper beer is an example of a tradition revival combining a few emerging trends, among which are the use of wild foods and attention to local recipes and home-fermented dishes. The changing role of juniper berries in the history of the drink should also be noted. Originally, the berries were the richest local source of sugar, and thus they naturally became the main ingredient of fermented beverages. With time, the composition of the drink evolved and sugar and honey were added. The original juniper components now serve mainly as flavoring, giving the drink its characteristic resinous taste and fragrance.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeers 3ahoney 3ahouseholds 3aingredients 3aodors 3arecipes 3asmall fruits 3asugars 3ataste 3awild foods 3aPoland 0aherbal beers 0abeverages 0afermentation 0atraditional knowledge revival 0aJuniperus communis1 aPirożnikow, Ewa,1 aDumanowski, Jarosław1 aŁuczaj, Łukasz0 tJournal of ethnobiology.g2014 Feb., v. 34, no. 1 p.84-103dSociety of EthnobiologywJournal:19742x2162-44967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2993/0278-0771-34.1.843Available from publisher's site40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2993/0278-0771-34.1.84  aDNAL 7aarticle01877naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002300112245006500135300001600200520104500216592002801261650001201289650001101301650001201312650001601324650001901340650001101359650001101370650002301381651002201404700002001426773010801446852000901554655001201563IND60563035120221120201716.0170209e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056303512DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMack, Charlotte L.10aNew Banksieaeidites species and pollen morphology in Banksia  ap. 303-323.  aCookson (1950) erected the fossil pollen genus Banksieaeidites to accommodate palynomorphs with characters resembling those of the extant Proteaceae genus Banksia.

At the initial concentration of 50 mg/L NH₄⁺-N and 75 mg/L NO₃⁻-N, Fe(Ⅱ) (10 mg/L) promoted the total nitrogen removal efficiency from 80.79 to 94.92% by core-shell sulfurized AnAOB coupled with sulfur oxidizing bacteria (S⁰@AnAOB+SOB). AnAOB outcompeted SOB for nitrite, because the addition of Fe(Ⅱ) not only increased the nitrate reductase activity (37.54%), but also enhanced the metabolism and electron capture ability of AnAOB, which was highly related with energy metabolic process: hydrazine dehydrogenase activity increased to 139.00 %. Particularly, Fe(Ⅱ) accelerated the interspecies electron transfer (INET) (from SOB to AnAOB) by stimulating the secretion of redox species and electron hopping in EPS. This study shed light on the mechanism of Fe(Ⅱ) promoting electron transfer in S⁰@AnAOB+SOB system, and provided basis for engineering practice.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonia 3aanaerobic ammonium oxidation 3adenitrification 3aelectron transfer 3aenergy 3ahydrazine 3ametabolism 3anitrate reductase 3anitrites 3asecretion 3asulfur 3atechnology 3atotal nitrogen 3awastewater 0aAnammox 0asulfur autotrophic denitrification 0aintracellular and interspecies electron transfer 0alow ammonium wastewater 0anitrogen removal1 aLiu, Huimin1 aZhang, Yujie1 aChen, Yuancai1 aQin, Yexia0 tBioresource technology.g2022 Sept. 26,  p.128051-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2022.128051  aDNAL 7aarticle01854naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100004300140245010900183300001800292520083900310592002801149650002501177650002301202650001201225650002201237650001601259650001301275650001701288650002401305773012801329856007401457852000901531655001201540IND60657862020221116205053.0190816e20150820xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065786202DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ay00510h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKovarik, Michelle L.q(Michelle Lynn),10aAnalytical chemistry research at primarily undergraduate institutions: training tomorrow's investigators  ap. 6960-6966.  aPrimarily undergraduate institutions (PUIs) are a unique training ground for young scientists who work closely with faculty on their research.

One solution is the development and mobilization of technologies that either 1)prevent plastics from entering waterways or2) collect marine and riverineplastic pollution. To date, however, few reports have focused on these technologies, and information on various technological developments is scattered. This leaves policymakers, innovators, and researchers without a central, comprehensive, and reliable source of information on the status of available technology to target this global problem. The goal of this study was to address this gap by creating a comprehensive inventory of technologies currently used or in development to prevent the leakage of plastic pollution or collect existing plastic pollution. Our Plastic Pollution Prevention and Collection Technology Inventory (https://nicholasinstitute.duke.edu/plastics-technology-inventory) can be used as a roadmap for researchers and governments to 1) facilitate comparisons between the scope of solutions and the breadth and severity of the plastic pollution problem and 2) assist in identifying strengths and weaknesses of current technological approaches. We created this inventory from a systematic search and review of resources that identified technologies. Technologies were organized by the type of technology and target plastics (i.e., macroplastics, microplastic, or both). We identified 52 technologies that fall into the two categories of prevention or collection of plastic pollution. Of these, 59% focus specifically on collecting macroplastic waste already in waterways. While these efforts to collect plastic pollution are laudable, their current capacity and widespread implementation are limited in comparison to their potential and the vast extent of the plastic pollution problem. Similarly, few technologies attempt to prevent plastic pollution leakage, and those that do are limited in scope. A comprehensive approach is needed that combines technology, policymaking, and advocacy to prevent further plastic pollution and the subsequent damage to aquatic ecosystems and human health.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadvocacy 3aenvironment 3ahuman health 3ainformation sources 3ainventories 3amicroplastics 3apollution 3aremediation 3awastes 0amarine plastic 0aplastic pollution 0aplastic remediation 0aremediation technology1 aMelvin, Emily C.1 aDiana, Zoie1 aGunady, Ella F.1 aRittschof, Daniel1 aSomarelli, Jason A.1 aVirdin, John1 aDunphy-Daly, Meagan M.0 tEnvironment international.g2020 Nov., v. 144 p.106067-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6374x0160-41207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2020.1060673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03165naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001300152245014800165300001800313520142200331592002801753650001301781650004401794650002801838650001401866650002101880650001301901650002001914650002301934650001901957650001301976650002101989650002002010650001902030650004402049650002002093650001302113650001302126650002102139650001702160653002302177653002002200653002302220700001802243700001702261700001502278700001802293700001802311700002002329700001802349773013602367856008702503852000902590655001202599IND60676646220221121024905.0200330e20200501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067664622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2019.10.2162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Ying10aPurification, characterization and anti-tumor activities of polysaccharides from Ecklonia kurome obtained by three different extraction methods  ap. 1000-1010.  aTo investigate and compare the effects of different extraction methods on the structure and anti-tumor activity of Ecklonia kurome polysaccharides (EP), three techniques, namely hot water extraction (HW), ultrasonic-assisted extraction (UA) and enzyme-assisted extraction (EA), were used to extract EP, and three crude EPs were purified by DEAE-cellulose and gel filtration chromatography. The significant antitumor active components in each method were screened by MTT assay and named as HW-EP5, UA-EP4 and EA-EP3, respectively. The molecular weight, FT-IR assay and NMR showed that HW-EP5, UA-EP4 and EA-EP3 were pyran polysaccharides with a molecular weight of 14,466, 15,922 and 16,947 Da, respectively. HW-EP5 contained the most monosaccharides and the highest content of sulfate and uronic acid. HW-EP5 had an even and smooth sheet-like appearance, while UA-EP4 and EA-EP3 exhibited irregular and rough fragments. All three polysaccharides can inhibit the migration of human breast cancer cells (MCF-7) and promote its apoptosis. All three polysaccharides promoted caspase activity during apoptosis. HW-EP5 and UA-EP4 up-regulated the expression of proapoptotic proteins Bax and p53, while EA-EP3 only up-regulated the expression of p53. These experimental results indicate that Ecklonia kurome polysaccharides, especially HW-EP5, have great potential as a natural medicine for the treatment of breast cancer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEcklonia 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aantineoplastic activity 3aapoptosis 3abreast neoplasms 3acaspases 3aenzyme activity 3agel chromatography 3ahuman diseases 3amedicine 3amolecular weight 3amonosaccharides 3aneoplasm cells 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apolysaccharides 3aproteins 3asulfates 3atoxicity testing 3auronic acids 0aExtraction methods 0aEcklonia kurome 0aAntitumor activity1 aQin, Gaoyixin1 aZheng, Zhen,1 aYuan, Biao1 aHuang, Dechun1 aCheng, Shujie1 aCao, Chongjiang1 aChen, Guitang0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2020 May 01, v. 150 p.1000-1010dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2019.10.2163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03735naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024001900116024003500135040001800170100002200188245014100210300001200351506007600363520223100439592002802670596004402698596004402742506003702786650001602823650001502839650002002854650001002874650002302884650001502907650001202922650001302934650001102947650002202958650001202980650001302992700001903005700002203024700002303046773010503069856008203174852000903256655001203265IND60548477320221207060253.0200812e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054847732DNAL7 aPMC49242492pmcid7 a273501282pmid7 a10.1186/s12870-016-0835-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSkinner, Debra J.10aConservation of the role of INNER NO OUTER in development of unitegmic ovules of the Solanaceae despite a divergence in protein function  ap. 143.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: The INNER NO OUTER (INO) gene is expressed in the outermost cell layer of the outer integument of bitegmic ovules and is essential for this organ’s growth. The role and cross-species functional conservation of INO orthologs were examined in members of the Solanaceae, which have unitegmic ovules. Unitegmy has evolved several times in disparate angiosperm lineages. INO expression has been observed in the outermost cell layers of all examined unitegmic ovules, but the functional role of INO in unitegmic ovules has not previously been evaluated. RESULTS: INO orthologs were unambiguously identified in tobacco and tomato by sequence homology. Expression of the tomato INO gene was limited to the outer cell layer of the single integument indicating that this single integument has properties of the outer integument. Expression occurred only after integument initiation, later than observed in ovules of other examined angiosperms. Virus-induced knock-down of expression of the INO ortholog in tobacco inhibited growth of the outer cell layer of the integument leading to a decrease in both integument extension and curvature of the ovule. The altered ovules closely resemble those of the aberrant testa shape (ats) ino mutant combination in Arabidopsis where we see the effect of the ino mutation on a single fused integument produced by the ats mutation. Despite significant sequence identity and similar expression patterns, the tomato INO coding region was not able to complement the Arabidopsis ino mutant. CONCLUSIONS: The similarity of effects of ino mutations on the unitegmic ovules of tobacco and the fused integuments of the Arabidopsis ats mutant show that: 1) INO orthologs play the same role in promoting integument growth in ovules of tobacco and Arabidopsis; and 2) the unitegmic ovules of tobacco (and hence other solanaceous species) are most likely the result of a congenital fusion of two ancestral integuments. Our results further indicate that INO has a conserved role in growth of the outermost cell layer of integuments. The curvature of solanaceous ovules is driven by unequal growth of the outer layers of the single integument that likely correspond to an ancestral outer integument.  aPublisher supplied data  aIBN9983354cNational Science Foundation  aIOS1354014cNational Science Foundation0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis 3aSolanaceae 3agene expression 3agenes 3agrowth retardation 3aintegument 3amutants 3amutation 3aovules 3asequence homology 3atobacco 3atomatoes1 aBrown, Ryan H.1 aKuzoff, Robert K.1 aGasser, Charles S.0 tBMC plant biology.g2016 Dec., v. 16, no. 1 p.143-143dBioMed CentralwJournal:2167x1471-22297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12870-016-0835-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02064naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001800142245008600160300001600246500001400262520076400276592002801040650001801068650002001086650001401106650001801120650001601138650001501154650001301169650001801182650001901200650001201219650002301231650002201254650001001276650002301286650001201309650000901321650000901330653001701339700001601356773014901372856007601521852000901597655001201606IND60710135420221119130336.0200908e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071013542DNAL7 a10.18805/ijar.B-10282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMustafa, N.G.10aBiochemical investigation of an experimentally induced metabolic syndrome in rats  ap. 168-172.  aNAL-light  aMetabolic syndrome (MS) is a complex condition characterized by insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and obesity. This project aims to induce MS in rat and then a demonstration of the main biochemical parameters. In male, Sprague-Dawley rats, MS has been prompted suitably and relatively by fast (six weeks) approach through a high fructose in drinking water (40%). It has been found that serum urea, creatinine and total bilirubin raise in MS significantly. Moreover, dyslipidemia has arbitrated via some considerable lipid profile deviations. In addition, BMI, blood glucose, and insulin monitoring evidently ensure achievement of MS. It is concluded that a well-established rat model of MS could be employed by a 40% fructose in drinking water.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal models 3aanimal research 3abilirubin 3ablood glucose 3ablood serum 3acreatinine 3afructose 3ahyperglycemia 3ahyperlipidemia 3ainsulin 3ainsulin resistance 3alipid composition 3amales 3ametabolic syndrome 3aobesity 3arats 3aurea 0aDyslipidemia1 aHasan, M.K.0 tIndian journal of animal research.g2020 Feb., v. 54, no. 2 p.168-172dAgricultural Research Communication CentrewJournal:2025x0976-05557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.18805/ijar.B-10283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02572naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245012200170300001700292520106200309592002801371650004401399650002201443650002901465650002101494650002101515650003801536650004401574650001801618650002201636650002301658650002101681653001801702653002301720653001001743653002301753700002401776700002001800700001801820700002501838700002001863773013501883856008702018852000902105655001202114IND60676646320221121024812.0200427e20200515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067664632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2019.10.2542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNoreen, Aqdas10aHydroxyethylcellulose-g-poly(lactic acid) blended polyurethanes: Preparation, characterization and biological studies  ap. 993-1003.  aThe present research project is planned to prepare novel biodegradable and biocompatible hydroxyethylcellulose-g-poly(lactic acid) (HEC-g-PLA) blended polyurethanes. Hydroxyl terminated polybutadiene (HTPB) was reacted with isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI) to produce NCO-terminated polyurethane prepolymer and extended further by varying the mole ratio of chain extenders (HEC-g-PLA and BDO). The synthesized polyurethane samples were characterized by using Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR), proton solid-state NMR (¹H SS NMR) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Thermal behavior of synthesized samples was checked by using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Biological behavior of the synthesized PU samples was also tested by various biological activities which showed much dependence on the mole ratio of chain extenders. Results indicated that incorporation of grafted HEC in to the polyurethane backbone leads to improvement in antibacterial activity, anti-biofilm inhibition, biocompatibility and non-mutagenicity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aantibacterial properties 3abiocompatibility 3abiodegradability 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apolyurethanes 3aresearch projects 3athermal properties 3athermogravimetry 0aBiodegradable 0aBiocompatible, PUs 0aFT-IR 0aThermal properties1 aZia, Khalid Mahmood1 aTabasum, Shazia1 aAftab, Waseem1 aShāhid, Muḥammad,1 aZuber, Mohammad0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2020 May 15, v. 151 p.993-1003dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2019.10.2543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02710naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245012000166300001600286520146000302592002801762650004101790650001901831650001901850650001201869650002301881650002101904650001501925650001601940650002001956650001501976651001301991653002302004653001902027653002002046653001502066700002702081773010102108856008202209852000902291655001202300IND60573099120221118193525.0190417e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057309912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ejrh.2017.06.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKang, Hyunwoo10aCombined statistical and spatially distributed hydrological model for evaluating future drought indices in Virginia  ap. 253-272.  aVirginia, United States.Climate change is expected to impact the intensity and severity of droughts; therefore, it is necessary to simulate future drought conditions using temperature and precipitation projections and hydrological models to derive reliable hydrological variables and drought indices. The objective of this study was to evaluate climate change influences on future drought potential and water resources in five major river basins in Virginia. In this study, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) and Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) climate models were used to compute a Standardized Soil Moisture Index (SSI), a Multivariate Standardized Drought Index (MSDI), and a Modified Palmer Drought Severity Index (MPDSI) for both historic and future periods. The drought conditions were evaluated, and their occurrences were determined at river basin scales.The results of the ensemble mean of SSI indicated that there was an overall increase in agricultural drought occurrences projected in the New (>1.3 times) and Rappahannock (>1.13 times) river basins due to increases in evapotranspiration and surface and groundwater flow. However, MSDI and MPDSI exhibited a decrease in projected future drought, despite increases in precipitation, which suggests that it is essential to use hybrid-modeling approaches and to interpret application-specific drought indices that consider both precipitation and temperature changes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSoil and Water Assessment Tool model 3aclimate change 3aclimate models 3adrought 3aevapotranspiration 3agroundwater flow 3asoil water 3atemperature 3awater resources 3awatersheds 3aVirginia 0aDrought projection 0aClimate change 0aDrought indices 0aSWAT model1 aSridhar, Venkataramana0 tJournal of hydrology.g2017 Aug., v. 12 p.253-272dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23229x2214-58187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrh.2017.06.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02454naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245010200166300001600268520098300284592002801267650002501295650002401320650001401344650000901358650001601367650001901383650002401402650001001426650003501436650002001471650001201491650004301503650002001546650001601566650002001582650001101602700002001613700001601633700002001649700001701669700001301686700001801699700001701717700001501734773010901749856008101858852000901939655001201948IND60152194320221121095117.0150529e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6015219432DNAL7 a10.1007/s00344-014-9472-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Meiliang10aEctopic Expression of Fagopyrum tataricum FtMYB12 Improves Cold Tolerance in Arabidopsis thaliana  ap. 362-371.  aMYB transcription factors play important roles in the abiotic stress response in plants, but their characteristics and functions in buckwheat (Fagopyrum tataricum) have not been fully investigated. Here, a novel R2R3-type MYB gene, designated FtMYB12, was isolated from the cultivated tartary buckwheat F. tataricum. Using quantitative real-time PCR, we found that the FtMYB12 was greatly induced by low temperature. Sub-localization and yeast transactivity assay demonstrated that the FtMYB12 gene encodes a nuclear transcription activator. Overexpression of FtMYB12 in transgenic Arabidopsis plants resulted in enhanced cold tolerance. The FtMYB12 overexpressing Arabidopsis lines showed higher root length and had elevated levels of proline content and lower levels of malondialdehyde under cold stress conditions compared to the wild-type plants. The results revealed that FtMYB12 may play an essential role in regulation of cold stress-responsive signaling in F. tataricum.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aFagopyrum tataricum 3abuckwheat 3acold 3acold stress 3acold tolerance 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3agenetically modified organisms 3amalondialdehyde 3aproline 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3astress response 3atemperature 3atransactivators 3ayeasts1 aWang, Chenglong1 aQi, Leipeng1 aYang, Xiongbang1 aSun, Zhanmin1 aTang, Yu1 aTang, Yixiong1 aShao, Jirong1 aWu, Yanmin0 tJournal of plant growth regulation.g2015 June, v. 34, no. 2 p.362-371dSpringer-Verlagx0721-75957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00344-014-9472-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02508naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245011500172500002200287520112600309592002801435650003101463650001301494650001101507650001701518650001301535650001201548650001801560650001601578650001201594650001101606650002001617653001501637653003301652653002601685653003001711700001801741700001601759700001601775700001701791700001901808700001601827700001701843773010401860856005301964852000902017655001202026IND60795567120221122061458.0221004e20220927xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079556712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2022.1280542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Zhenqiang10aGenomics and transcriptomics-guided metabolic engineering Corynebacterium glutamicum for L-arginine production  aPre-press version  aL-arginine is a semi-essential amino acid that is broadly used as food additives and pharmaceutical intermediates. The synthesis of L-arginine is restricted by complex metabolic mechanisms and suboptimal fermentation conditions. Initially, a mutant strain that accumulated 19.4 g/L L-arginine was generated by random mutagenesis. Subsequently, a mutation of the repressor protein (argRᴳ¹⁵⁹ᴰ) in the L-arginine operon and glutamate synthase (gltD) with 532-fold upregulation were identified to be vital for L-arginine production by multi-omic analysis. Systematic metabolic engineering was used to modify the strain, which included interfering with α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (ODHC) activity by knocking out serine/threonine-protein kinase (pknG), enhancing the expression of multiple key enzymes in the L-arginine synthesis pathway, and increasing the availability of intracellular cofactor (NADPH) and energy (ATP). Finally, C. glutamicum ARG12 produced 71.3 g/L L-arginine, with a yield of 0.43 g/g glucose by fermentation optimization. This study provides new ideas to boost L-arginine production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCorynebacterium glutamicum 3aarginine 3aenergy 3afermentation 3agenomics 3aglucose 3aglutamic acid 3amutagenesis 3amutants 3aoperon 3aoxidoreductases 0aL-arginine 0aGenomics and transcriptomics 0aMetabolic engineering 0aFermentation optimization1 aCai, Mengmeng1 aLiu, Yunran1 aHu, Mengkai1 aYang, Fengyu1 aZhu, Rongshuai1 aXu, Meijuan1 aRao, Zhiming0 tBioresource technology.g2022 Sept. 27,  p.128054-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2022.128054  aDNAL 7aarticle04137naa a2200721 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245013100164520216100295592002802456650001602484650001602500650001902516650001902535650001902554650001902573650002002592650001702612650001302629650001602642650001702658650001602675650003002691650000902721650002602730650002302756650002002779650001702799650001102816650005402827650002002881650001502901650002602916653000902942653000802951653000702959653000802966653000802974653001002982653000802992653000703000653000903007653000803016653000903024653000803033653000803041653001503049653000903064653000903073653002103082653000803103700001903111700001503130700005703145773011003202856008203312852000903394655001203403IND60766020420221120075743.0220214e20220228xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076602042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tox.2022.1531132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Dongning10aROS and iron homeostasis dependent ferroptosis play a vital role in 5-Fluorouracil induced cardiotoxicity in vitro and in vivo  a5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) was a key chemotherapeutic agent in the treatment of different solid tumors. However, cardiotoxicity was included among the therapeutic strategies of 5-FU. The molecular mechanism of cardiotoxicity induced by 5-FU remains unclear. The aim of the study was to investigate whether ferroptosis was involved in 5-FU-induced cardiotoxicity in vivo and in vitro. The in vivo cardiotoxicity model was induced by intraperitoneal injection of 5-FU at the dose of 15, 30, 60 mg/kg for 7 days. Body weight, general condition and plasma enzyme activities of the mice were observed to evaluate heart function. In addition, HE staining, MASSON staining and TEM technology was used. Western-blot analysis were performed to evaluate the protein level of iron transport, iron storage and reactive oxygen species (ROS) of ferroptosis. In H9c2 cardiomyocyte cells, cell viability, generation of ROS, mitochondrial activity and cellular Fe²⁺ levels were measured. The in vivo results showed that 5-FU significantly impaired cardiac function and structure. The serum creatine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels were significantly increased in 5-FU group. HE and MASSON staining showed that 5-FU caused structural injuries. In addition, 5-FU increased the level of ferroptosis markers involving malonaldehyde (MDA) and Fe²⁺ content. Ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1) was an aromatic amine that specifically binds with lipid ROS and protects cells against lipid peroxidation. Furthermore, 5-FU markedly induced ferroptosis in H9c2 cardiomyocyte cells, which mainly embodied as declined cell vitality, accumulated iron, elevated lipid peroxides. Conversely, inhibition of ferroptosis by Fer-1 completely abolished 5-FU-induced effects. Both in vivo and in vitro experiments indicated that 5-FU increased the expression of ferroptosis, mainly by reducing the expression of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) and ferritin heavy chain 1 (FTH1), but enhancing the expression of transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1). In conclusion, the present study suggested that ROS and iron homeostasis dependent ferroptosis played a vital role in 5-FU induced cardiotoxicity.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood serum 3abody weight 3acardiac output 3acardiomyocytes 3acardiotoxicity 3acell viability 3acreatine kinase 3adrug therapy 3aferritin 3aferroptosis 3afluorouracil 3ahomeostasis 3aintraperitoneal injection 3airon 3alactate dehydrogenase 3alipid peroxidation 3amalondialdehyde 3amitochondria 3amodels 3aphospholipid-hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase 3aprotein content 3atoxicology 3atransferrin receptors 0a5-FU 0aROS 0aCK 0aMDA 0aLDH 0aFer-1 0aTfR 0aTf 0aDMEM 0aGSH 0aGPX4 0aH&E 0aTEM 0aCalcein-AM 0aTMRE 0a5-FU 0aIron homeostasis 0aROS1 aSong, Chengzhu1 aZhang, Jie1 aZhao, Xiaoyan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8474-74160 tToxicology.g2022 Feb. 28, v. 468 p.153113-dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:11858x0300-483X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tox.2022.1531133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01464naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245007500159300001800234520064600252592002800898650002300926650001500949650001200964700001100976773012800987856007401115852000901189655001201198IND60657862420221116204901.0190816e20150820xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065786242DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ay00522a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnthony, S.

The aim of this study was to prepare BNZ loaded chitosan-pectin mucoadhesive nanocapsules (CPNCs) by polyelectrolyte complex coacervation method for ocular delivery and evaluated for its anti glaucoma efficacy.The prepared CPNCs were characterized for their particle size, polydispersity index, zeta-potential, surface morphology, entrapment efficiency, drug loading efficiency, mucoadhesive strength in-vitro and ex-vivo release. The pharmacodynamic studies were conducted for CPNCs on glaucoma induced rabbit eye model and compared with marketed product.All the formulated CPNCs exhibited the size range from 217.01 ± 0.21 to 240.05 ± 0.08 nm and appropriate physico-chemical parameters, and depicted a couple of erosion- diffusion release of BNZ over a time of 8 h. Ex-vivo corneal permeation study concluded that BNZ loaded CPNCs crosses the cornea potentially higher rate as compared to the marketed product. In pharmacodynamic study, greater intraocular pressure lowering effect was achieved by CPNCs as compared to marketed drug product.The result concluded that CPNCs are a feasible choice to conventional eye drops because of its ability to improve the bioavailability via its longer precorneal retention time and its ability to sustained release of the drug.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioadhesives 3abioavailability 3acarbonate dehydratase 3acornea 3adrugs 3aelectrolytes 3aenzyme inhibitors 3aglaucoma 3amodels 3ananocapsules 3aparticle size 3apermeability 3apharmacodynamics 3aphysicochemical properties 3arabbits 3azeta potential 0aBrinzolamide 0aChitosan-pectin nanocapsules 0aIntraocular pressure 0aGlaucoma 0aPolyelectrolyte complex coacervation1 aMohan, Parasuraman1 aDangi, Jawahar Singh1 aKesavan, Karthikeyan0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2020 June 01, v. 152 p.1224-1232dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2019.10.2193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03127naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245016900171300001800340520156200358592002801920650002001948650002001968650001201988650001702000650002202017650001402039650001902053650002002072650002202092650001302114650001402127650000902141650000902150650002702159650001902186651001002205651001802215700002402233700002502257700002202282700002602304700001802330700005802348773013602406856008202542852000902624655001202633IND60594655720221119181218.0180619e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059465572DNAL7 a10.1007/s10722-018-0622-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodolfi, Margherita10aIdentification and genetic structure of wild Italian Humulus lupulus L. and comparison with European and American hop cultivars using nuclear microsatellite markers  ap. 1405-1422.  aNine genic SSR loci were used to evaluate the genetic diversity and identify accessions in wild Italian Humulus lupulus L., in comparison with widely cultivated European and U.S. commercial cultivars. A collection of 80 wild hop samples from Italy and 43 hop cultivars from Europe and U.S., were characterized. Allelic frequency analysis revealed 65 distinct Italian genotypes and differentiated all the commercial cultivars; moreover, specific alleles were observed for wild and cultivated hops. The number of alleles identified in the wild population were 104 and 123 within all the accessions. The maximum polymorphic information content was evidenced for locus HlGA23 in the Italian wild population and in the whole set of accessions (0.905 and 0.902 respectively). The dendrogram constructed from Euclidean distance with the UPGMA method showed two main clusters, one including commercial American and European accessions and one mostly composed by wild Italian accessions. Model-based clustering (Bayesian method) placed the accessions into five germplasm groups, one of which was characterized by Italian genotypes only. The study showed for the first time the great biodiversity present in Italy, and the remarkable differences with European and American hops. It was also found that within the population of north-central Italy a large genetic variability is present, suited to be studied and exploited; this genetic wealth could be used in future breeding programs in order to develop new hop varieties carrying characteristics useful for brewers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aHumulus lupulus 3aalleles 3abiodiversity 3abreeding programs 3acultivars 3agene frequency 3agenetic markers 3agenetic variation 3agenotype 3agermplasm 3ahops 3aloci 3amicrosatellite repeats 3awild relatives 3aItaly 3aUnited States1 aSilvanini, Annalisa1 aChiancone, Benedetta1 aMarieschi, Matteo1 aFabbri, A.q(Andrea),1 aBruni, Renato1 aGanino, Tommaso1http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5590-27470 tGenetic resources and crop evolution.g2018 June, v. 65, no. 5 p.1405-1422dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl49569x0925-98647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10722-018-0622-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02929naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002800153245012000181300001600301520158100317592002801898653000701926653000801933653001101941653001101952653000801963653000801971653000801979653000801987653000801995653000902003653003502012653005502047653002802102653002502130653003602155700001802191700002002209700002502229700002902254773010402283856008702387852000902474655001202483IND60594078120221119100429.0180510e20160920xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059407812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.electacta.2016.07.1112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTraunsteiner, Christoph10aLaccase immobilized on a mixed thiol monolayer on Au(111) – structure-dependent activity towards oxygen reduction  ap. 761-770.  aImmobilization of high-potential multicopper oxidases like laccase from Trametes versicolor (TvLc) on cathode surfaces in an orientation that enables direct electron transfer (DET) to the active center allows to profit from the enzyme’s low overpotential towards the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). In this work, TvLc is immobilized on mixed self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of thiolates on Au(111). The SAMs consist of two species, a linker molecule, thiolated veratric acid (tVA) with a moiety similar to the enzyme’s natural substrates, and a diluent molecule, 3-mercaptopropionic acid (MPA), which increases the lateral distance between neighboring tVA molecules when incorporated between the linkers. In this work we study the effect of linker separation on enzyme activity. Electrochemical scanning tunneling microscopy (EC-STM) is used to determine the molecular arrangement of the two species in two different SAMs. After enzyme immobilization, negligible enzymatic activity is found on a monolayer, where a separation between tVA and MPA phases is observed. This is explained by the close packing of tVA linkers, which prevents access to the enzyme’s active center. Maximum bioelectrocatalytic currents at low overpotentials are measured on a SAM, where tVA and MPA homogeneously mix in a single phase. The increased distance between isolated linkers allows for induced-fit binding of TvLc to the linker moiety, which leads to a proper orientation of the enzyme and allows for DET from the electrode through the linker molecule to the enzyme’s active center.  aPublisher supplied data 0aCV 0aDET 0aEC-AFM 0aEC-STM 0aEIS 0aMPA 0aORR 0aSAM 0atVA 0aTvLc 0aDirect electron transfer (DET) 0aElectrochemical scanning probe microscopy (EC-SPM) 0aEnzyme electrocatalysis 0aMolecular resolution 0aOxygen reduction reaction (ORR)1 aSek, Slawomir1 aHuber, Veronika1 aValero-Vidal, Carlos1 aKunze-Liebhäuser, Julia0 tElectrochimica acta.g2016 Sept. 20, v. 213 p.761-770dElsevier LtdwJournal:26735x0013-46867nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.electacta.2016.07.1113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02669naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001200153245012900165520121400294592002801508650001501536650001801551650001601569650001101585650002101596650002001617650002801637650002101665650002401686650001201710650002001722650000901742650002001751650001801771650001601789653003401805653003301839653002001872653001401892700001601906700001801922700001801940700001901958773011301977856008802090852000902178655001202187IND60793869720221118051442.0220929e202301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079386972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enzmictec.2022.1101322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBi, Ran10aEnzymatic biosensor based on dendritic gold nanostructure and enzyme precipitation coating for glucose sensing and detection  aWith the development of blood glucose monitoring medical devices, higher requirements are put forward for the sensitivity and detection limit of biosensors. Herein, a high-performance flexible enzymatic glucose biosensor was prepared by electrochemical deposition of dendritic gold nanostructure on carbon cloth substrate, then covalently immobilizing glucose oxidase on the dendritic gold, and then increasing enzyme loading by enzyme precipitation coating. The morphology of dendritic gold nanostructures was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The electrochemical performance of the biosensor was analyzed by cyclic voltammetry (CV), chronoamperometry curve and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). It is found that the obtained biosensor has high sensitivity (72.45 μA mM⁻¹ cm⁻²), low detection limit (6.7 μM) and ultra-wide linear range (0.02–31.7 mM) for glucose detection. In addition, the biosensor also has good selectivity, reproducibility and stability. In the detection of real serum samples, the biosensor also shows good accuracy and practicality. The results show that the new biosensor has great potential for applications in biomedical and health care.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiosensors 3ablood glucose 3ablood serum 3acarbon 3achemical bonding 3adetection limit 3adielectric spectroscopy 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectron microscopy 3aglucose 3aglucose oxidase 3agold 3ahealth services 3ananomaterials 3avoltammetry 0aDendritic gold nanostructures 0aEnzyme precipitation coating 0aGlucose oxidase 0aBiosensor1 aMa, Xiaoyan1 aMiao, Kunpeng1 aMa, Pengcheng1 aWang, Qianqian0 tEnzyme and microbial technology.g2023 Jan., v. 162 p.110132-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12419x0141-02297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enzmictec.2022.1101323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02749naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002800147245009800175300001600273520133100289592002801620650002201648650001801670650001501688650001601703650001901719650002401738650002601762650001101788650001001799650001801809650002701827651001201854700002601866700002101892700002001913700002101933700002201954700002001976700003101996700002402027700003102051773010702082856008102189852000902270655001202279IND60574010820221120215122.0170725e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057401082DNAL7 a10.1007/s10750-016-2996-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGligora Udovič, Marija10aDefining centric diatoms of most relevant phytoplankton functional groups in deep karst lakes  ap. 169-191.  aPhytoplankton in karst lakes is characterized by co-occurrence of chrysophytes (Chrysophyceae), dinoflagellates (Dinophyceae), and diatoms (Bacillariophyta) as the most diverse and abundant group. Using Reynolds functional approach in ecological phytoplankton investigations makes karstic lakes comparable and facilitates interpretation of their responses to changing environmental conditions. Accurate taxonomic identification to species level, based on precise resolution of specific characteristics by electron microscopy, is essential in order to correctly associate species into coda. This paper defines the most abundant centric diatoms and coexisting species in the phytoplankton of karst lakes in Croatia as a contribution to better description of phytoplankton functional groups dominated by centric diatoms. Several representatives for diatom-based Reynolds functional groups of four lakes in Croatia were described in this paper: Pantocsekiella costei and Stephanocostis chantaica for group A, Pantocsekiella ocellata and Cyclotella distinguenda for group B, and Stephanodiscus neoastraea for group C, together with their ecological preferences which clearly correspond to pertaining functional classification. Selected and coexisting functional groups define natural, oligo- to mesotrophic karst deep lake systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillariophyceae 3aChrysophyceae 3aCyclotella 3aDinophyceae 3aStephanodiscus 3aelectron microscopy 3aenvironmental factors 3akarsts 3alakes 3aphytoplankton 3aspecies identification 3aCroatia1 aCvetkoska, Aleksandra1 aŽutinić, Petar1 aBosak, Sunčica1 aStanković, Igor1 aŠpoljarić, Igor1 aMršić, Gordan1 aKralj Borojević, Koraljka1 aĆukurin, Anamarija1 aPlenković-Moraj, Anđelka0 tHydrobiologia.g2017 Mar., v. 788, no. 1 p.169-191dSpringer International Publishingx0018-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-016-2996-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02818naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004900092040001800141100001700159245005000176300001800226500000900244500001500253520183100268592002802099650001902127650001902146650001602165650001802181653001602199700003302215773015102248852000902399856009602408655001202504IND2051787520221121015039.0191125e199409  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205178752DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1994.03615995005800050004x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aElder, A.

Techniques for obtaining the relationship in unconsolidated geologic media may be unsuitable for consolidated media due to the difficulty of extracting undisturbed samples for water content analysis. The calibration relationship, θ = α₀ + (α₁ + α₂ρb)C = α₃ρb, with C = neutron counts, and ρb = dry bulk density, provided a good predictor of volumetric water content, θ, for consolidated media at the Apache Leap Tuff Site. Four techniques were employed to obtain data necessary to construct this relationship. Two methods employed a neutron transport code to predict neutron counts from scattering and absorption neutron cross sections. The first method calculated cross sections from elemental compositions, while the second used cross sections obtained from rock samples placed in a graphite pile containing a neutron source. The third method used in situ neutron counts measured in two access holes constructed in unsaturated rock with known water contents estimated from rock fragments excavated surrounding the access holes using a pneumatic hammer. The fourth technique used neutron counts from crushed rock packed into containers and maintained at prescribed water contents. Neutron cross sections obtained from elemental analyses were smaller than graphite-pile values, although the differences were insignificant at the 95% confidence level and the difference in rock water content predictions was small. The neutron transport model provided neutron count estimates consistent with in situ counts and counts from saturated crushed rock in containers. Work was performed at Dep. of Hydrology and Water Resources, Univ. of Arizona, Tucson.  aPublisher supplied data 3aneutron probes 3avolcanic rocks 3acalibration 3awater content 0amethodology1 aRasmussen, T.

This study was designed to characterize the cellulase obtained from a thermophilic bacterium, Neobacillus sedimentimangrovi UE25. A combined pretreatment of NaOH and methyltrioctylammonium chloride was given to sugarcane bagasse (SB) for lignin removal and the pretreated SB was utilized as a carbon source for the cellulase production. The thermostable cellulase thus obtained was characterized by adopting central composite design which has not been reported earlier for this purpose. Cellulase showed its maximum activity at pH 7 and temperature 60 ℃ and it remained active in the presence of many salts and detergents. Endoglucanase (EG) was found to be stable for 30 min at 80 ℃. The purification of EG by using DEAE column yielded specific activity and purification fold of 365.866 IU mg⁻¹ and 4.264, respectively. The purified EG had a molecular weight of ∼45 kDa. End product tolerance of EG was also evident, as an activity of 228.57 IU mL⁻¹ was observed in the presence of 60 mM glucose which revealed that it does not lose its activity upon accumulation of end-product when the reaction is prolonged. The purified EG exhibited Vₘₐₓ and Kₘ of 294 U mL⁻¹ min⁻¹ and 36 µM, respectively, in the presence of 60 mM glucose. This novel thermostable cellulase can finds its applications in industrial sector.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiorefining 3acarbon 3achlorides 3acost effectiveness 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3aglucose 3alignin 3amolecular weight 3apH 3asugarcane bagasse 3atemperature 3athermal stability 3athermophilic bacteria 0aCentral composite design 0aGlucose 0aPurification 0aSugarcane bagasse 0aThermostable cellulase1 aMoin, Syed Faraz1 aSohail, Muhammad1 aMersal, Gaber A.M.1 aIbrahim, Mohamed M.1 aEl-Bahy, Salah M.0 tEnzyme and microbial technology.g2023 Jan., v. 162 p.110133-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12419x0141-02297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enzmictec.2022.1101333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01252naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001600144245009900160506002800259520030600287592002800593506003700621650001800658650001600676650001100692700002100703700002200724773012800746856007900874852000900953655001200962IND60785246420221207082406.0190503s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078524642DNAL7 a10.5281/zenodo.25614532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKozyr, M.S.14aThe ecological and coenotic characteristic of Iris sibirica L. in the floodlands of Seim river  aResource is Open Access  aThe current distribution of Iris sibirica L. in the floodlands of Seim river is established.

Yet, protections for biodiversity are frequently undermined because the distributions of priority species are poorly known in most locations at the spatial scales required to inform planning decisions (i.e. c. 1–100 ha). Planning applications are often screened against opportunistic records to determine potential impacts to priority species. However, raw occurrence records provide information only on where a species has been detected and cannot be used to indicate if a species is likely to be absent from a site. Inferences drawn from these data on the likelihood of a species being present at a site can only be correctly interpreted through an appropriate species distribution modelling (SDM) framework that ensures assumptions about the data and models are formalised and documented. We argue that SDM frameworks must be integrated into ecological impact assessments to improve support for biodiversity protections within planning and development processes. Biases and uncertainties in opportunistic data create modelling challenges, but recent methodological advances can minimise their impacts on predictions. We advocate co‐production with practitioners of SDM tools, mapping products and best‐practice guidelines specific to planning processes. Policy implications. The integration of species distribution modelling frameworks into ecological impact assessments will strengthen biodiversity protections in planning and development processes by ensuring methodological transparency and rigour in the interpretation of species occurrence data.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapplied ecology 3abiodiversity 3aenvironmental impact 3ageographical distribution 3aissues and policy 3alaws and regulations1 aMaclean, Ilya,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8030-91361 aGoodall, Martin1 aGaston, Kevin J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7235-79280 tJournal of applied ecology.g2021 Jan., v. 58, no. 1 p.21-26dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl57298x0021-89017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2664.137823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03076naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001500139245008200154520200400236592002802240650002202268650002102290650001402311650001102325650001302336650002202349650002802371650001702399650002002416650002502436650001502461700001902476700001802495773011902513856007302632852000902705655001202714IND60653398720221119080604.0190714e20180824xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065339872DNAL7 a10.3390/w100911312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Lili10aWater Resources Carrying Capacity Analysis of YarLung Tsangpo River Basin (I)  aWater resources carrying capacity (WRCC) analysis is critically important in providing guidance to the sustainable development strategies of the YarLung Tsangpo River Basin (YTRB) due to the conflicts among the ample water resources, low development level of society, and the fragile ecological environment. This study evaluated the scheduled developing mode of YTRB in the planning years from 2016 to 2030 with a WRCC system containing three components: a hydrological informatics modeling system (HIMS), water resources carrying capacity (WRCC) model, and an index evaluation system. The averaged WRCC index is 4.29, 1.19, and 0.06 for the planning years, and 2.61, 0.98, 0.05 for the baseline years for the three sub-basins. The water deficiency problem becomes more severe in the upper sub-basin and appears in the middle sub-basin with the WRCC index greater than 1, while the water resources are not fully utilized in the lower sub-basin in the planning years, with the WRCC index far less than 1. The GDP of the three sub-basins is greater in the planning years, with 2.25 &times; 108, 54.60 &times; 108, and 3.94 &times; 108 dollars year&minus;1 than those in the baseline years with 1.97 &times; 108, 47.71 &times; 108, 3.43 &times; 108 dollars year&minus;1. However, GDP per capita/cubic meter keeps decreasing due to the great population growth rate and non-enhanced water use efficiency. The sustainability index is 0.04, 0.23, and 0.47 in the planning years, which is lower than the 0.04, 0.31, and 0.50 in the baseline years. Therefore, the scheduled growth rates of the population, urbanization, and GDP are a developing mode with low sustainability and are not appropriate to be continued in the planning years. Further work is needed to identify a sustainable developing mode with a decreased population growth rate, enhanced water use efficiency in the economic system, and the optimized allocation of water resources distribution in the three sub-basins with hydraulic facilities.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarrying capacity 3aeconomic systems 3ahydrology 3amodels 3aplanning 3apopulation growth 3asustainable development 3aurbanization 3awater resources 3awater use efficiency 3awatersheds1 aWang, Zhonggen1 aLiu, Xiaocong0 tWater.g2018 Aug. 24, v. 10, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w100911313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02033naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245011300169300001300282500002000295520088100315592002801196650001801224650001901242650001601261650001401277650001401291650002101305650001301326650002101339650001701360700002101377700002001398773016201418856008201580852000901662655001201671IND60790689920221119142350.0220826e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079068992DNAL7 a10.2134/itsrj2016.09.08062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeyer, William A.10aBreeding Cool‐Season Turfgrass Cultivars for Stress Tolerance and Sustainability in a Changing Environment  ap. 3-10.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aGrowth and sustainability of cool‐season turfgrass species has the potential to be negatively impacted by future climate change; therefore, it will be necessary to breed turfgrass cultivars that have improved abiotic and biotic stress tolerance compared with cultivars that are currently available.

This keynote address will discuss the impact climate change will have on plant breeding objectives, breeding techniques used by Rutgers University, and advances that have been made in breeding cool‐season grasses for improved abiotic and biotic stress tolerance.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiotic stress 3aclimate change 3acold season 3acultivars 3agermplasm 3aopen pollination 3aresearch 3astress tolerance 3aturf grasses1 aHoffman, Lindsey1 aBonos, Stacy A.0 tInternational Turfgrass Society research journal.g2017 Nov., v. 13, no. 1 p.3-10dInternational Turfgrass Society and ACSESSwJournal:27673x2573-15137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/itsrj2016.09.08063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03356naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006500148245018800213300001100401520180900412592002802221596004102249596008802290650001902378650002502397650001002422650001402432650002402446650002502470650000902495650001402504650001602518650001602534650001502550651002202565700002702587700001902614700002302633700005902656773011502715856008302830852000902913655001202922IND60772619620221121184411.0220517e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077261962DNAL7 a10.1007/s00227-022-04049-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVeelenturf, Callie A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0435-018214aThe effects of nest location and beach environment on hatching success for leatherback (Dermochelys coriacea) and green (Chelonia mydas) sea turtles on Bioko Island, Equatorial Guinea  ap. 56.  aHatching success of sea turtle eggs can be reduced by a variety of biotic and abiotic factors. This study of the nesting ecology of leatherback (Dermochelys coriacea) and green (Chelonia mydas) sea turtles, investigated how several environmental factors and beach characteristics on Bioko Island, Equatorial Guinea influence sea turtle reproductive success. Average hatching success was 40.4% for green turtles and 41.73% for leatherback turtles. For leatherback turtles, clutch elevation relative to the high tide line (HTL) was found to be the most influential factor in determining hatching success, highlighting the sensitivity of this species to sea-level rise (SLR). Multiple linear regression analysis demonstrated that nest distance to vegetation, temperature, sand grain size, location on the beach, and sand conductivity also played significant roles in leatherback clutch hatching success. For leatherback clutches, 33% percent of nests were affected by inundation and 17% by predation. An optimum clutch elevation range for leatherback turtles was identified, where a distinct increase in hatching success was observed between − 0.286 and − 0.0528 m above the HTL. For green sea turtles, 64% of experimental nests were affected by predation, confounding conclusions about the roles of environmental characteristics in green turtle hatching success. We propose further investigation into influential characteristics in green turtle nests and confirmation of the observed optimum elevation range on Bioko Island and other nesting grounds. Identified sensitivities of each species to SLR and beach characteristics will be used to encourage the government of Equatorial Guinea to consider the vulnerability of their resident turtle populations when planning for future coastal development.  aPublisher supplied data  a208369cHESS Equatorial Guinea, Inc.  aF.900001149.03.001cPurdue University Fort Wayne Schrey Distinguished Professorship 3aChelonia mydas 3aDermochelys coriacea 3anests 3apredation 3aregression analysis 3areproductive success 3asand 3asea level 3asea turtles 3atemperature 3avegetation 3aEquatorial Guinea1 aSinclair, Elizabeth M.1 aLeopold, Peter1 aPaladino, Frank V.1 aHonarvar, Shaya1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5981-31000 tMarine biology.g2022 May, v. 169, no. 5 p.56-56dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3080x0025-31627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00227-022-04049-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02838naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001700164245012400181300001400305520114500319592002801464650003201492650001301524650001101537650001001548650001801558650002601576650001401602650001301616650001201629650001201641650001301653650005001666650002501716650008501741650003701826650002801863650001401891650003101905650003601936650003801972651001002010651001002020700001802030700001502048700001702063700001602080700001902096700001602115773008402131856004802215852000902263655001202272IND4478576520221120225525.0121003e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447857652DNAL7 a218422332pmid7 a10.1007/s11262-011-0657-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuo, Hongbin10aPhylogenetic analysis of the S1 glycoprotein gene of infectious bronchitis viruses isolated in China during 2009–2010  ap. 19-23.  aAs part of our ongoing surveillance program, 40 field strains of avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) were isolated from dead or diseased chicken flocks in different areas of China between 2009 and 2010. S1 glycoprotein genes of these strains were sequenced and analyzed with 38 strains published in GenBank. S1 genes of these isolated strains and the vaccine strains showed nucleotide homologies ranging from 65.2 to 82% and amino acid homologies ranging from 58.4 to 81.9%. Meanwhile, Chinese IBV strains isolated in this study, which were mainly nephropathogenic, could be separated into six variant lineages (CH I–CH VI), and current vaccine strains used in China formed Mass variant lineage that is evolutionarily distant from Chinese isolates. Moreover, CK/CH/GD/NC10, CK/CH/GD/KP10, and our previous isolates TC07-2 formed the CH VI lineage, showing larger evolutionary distances from other strains. Taken together, these findings suggested that various variant lineages were co-circulating in China now, and appeared to be continuously evolving, alternative indigenous vaccines indeed need for effective control of IB in China.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInfectious bronchitis virus 3achickens 3aflocks 3agenes 3aglycoproteins 3ainfectious bronchitis 3aphylogeny 3avaccines 3aviruses 2aAnimals 2aChickens 2aCoronavirus Infectionsxveterinaryxvirology. 2aEvolution, Molecular 2aInfectious bronchitis virusxclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aMembrane Glycoproteinsxgenetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhylogeny 2aPoultry Diseasesxvirology 2aSpike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus 2aViral Envelope Proteinsxgenetics 3aChina 0aChina1 aQin, Jianping1 aChen, Feng1 aXie, Qingmei1 aBi, Yingzuo1 aCao, Yongchang1 aXue, Chunyi0 tVirus genes.g2012 Feb., v. 44, no. 1 p.19-23dSpringer-Verlagx0920-85697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11262-011-0657-x  aDNAL 7aarticle02920naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245011400166300001600280520152100296592002801817650002301845650001301868650002601881650001901907650001501926650001101941650002901952650001401981650001501995650001702010650001602027650001102043650002302054650001102077650000902088650001402097650001402111650001302125700001802138700003002156700001802186700001902204700002102223700002002244773009302264856004802357852000902405655001202414IND50062542620221120214536.0130322e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006254262DNAL7 a10.1007/s10533-011-9653-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRocker, Dagmar10aDifferential decomposition of humic acids by marine and estuarine bacterial communities at varying salinities  ap. 331-346.  aHumic substances (HS) constitute 50–80% of total dissolved organic matter (DOM) in freshwaters but in the open ocean <3%, indicating that large fractions of DOM and HS are removed in the estuarine and coastal zone. In order to assess the role of bacteria in this removal, we conducted experiments in flow-through cultures to examine the decomposition of peat bog-born humic acids (HA) by marine (salinity 30, Exp1) and estuarine (salinity 10, Exp2) bacterial communities. After ~70 days 40–>60% of the HA were decomposed. Highest fractions were decomposed in treatments in which the bacterial communities were fed by HA media of a foreign salinity, e.g., of 14 in Exp1 and of 28 in Exp2. Some of the HA material was not decomposed but broken down to smaller moieties entering the fulvic acid (FA) fraction. The analysis of the HA media and their residuals after bacterial decomposition by pyrolysis GC/MS showed that individual organic compounds were decomposed. In Exp1, 32 aliphatic and aromatic compounds, including lignin biomarkers, were detected in the HA medium of which mainly aliphatic compounds were decomposed. In Exp2, 49 compounds were detected of which ~40–60% were not detected any more after bacterial decomposition in the HA fraction but still in the FA fraction. The results show that estuarine and marine bacterial communities can decompose large amounts of HA and that this process is important in reducing the amount of terrestrial HS and DOM entering the estuarine and coastal region.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaromatic compounds 3abacteria 3abacterial communities 3abiodegradation 3abiomarkers 3acoasts 3adissolved organic matter 3aestuaries 3afreshwater 3afulvic acids 3ahumic acids 3alignin 3amarine environment 3aoceans 3apeat 3apeatlands 3apyrolysis 3asalinity1 aKisand, Veljo1 aScholz-Böttcher, Barbara1 aKneib, Thomas1 aLemke, Andreas1 aRullkötter, J.,1 aSimon, Meinhard0 tBiogeochemistry.g2012 Nov., v. 111, no. 1-3 p.331-346dSpringer-Verlagx0168-25637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10533-011-9653-4  aDNAL 7aarticle02633naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245008400167300001600251500002000267520132600287592002801613596003801641650001101679650002101690650002301711650002301734650001101757650001601768650000901784650001901793650001001812650001301822650001701835651001101852651001401863651001601877700002001893700003001913773016501943856008202108852000902190655001202199IND60790690320221119144828.0220826e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079069032DNAL7 a10.2134/itsrj2016.09.07312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSeeman, Owen D.10aFlat Mites: A Potential Threat to Turfgrasses Worldwide, or Already Widespread?  ap. 497-501.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aTwo species of flat mites (Acari: Tenuipalpidae) from the genus Dolichotetranychus have recently been found to cause significant damage to Cynodon (bermudagrass) and Zoysia spp. turfgrasses. Despite records of D. australianus infesting bermudagrass throughout Africa, the Middle East, and Australia for more than 70 yr, most turf managers assume that any apparent mite damage is due to the widely publicized eriophyoid bermudagrass mite, Aceria cynodoniensis, rather than validating this under the microscope. To an experienced eye, the visual symptoms are distinctly different from those typically associated with A. cynodoniensis; but they are similar to the symptoms seen with the zoysiagrass mite, D. zoysiae, in Okinawa (Japan). The possibility that there may be further undescribed or misidentified Dolichotetranychus species affecting turfgrasses is discussed, together with examples and biosecurity implications. One such species that may prove to be more significant than hitherto suspected, if routine microscopic diagnosis were to be implemented, is D. summersi, which has been recorded five times from bermudagrass in the United States during the 1950s and 1960s but without any indication of the symptoms caused. The importance of making microscopic examinations of suspected mite infestations is emphasized.  aPublisher supplied data  cHorticulture Innovation Australia 3aAceria 3aCynodon dactylon 3aDolichotetranychus 3aRyukyu Archipelago 3aZoysia 3abiosecurity 3aeyes 3alawns and turf 3amites 3aresearch 3aturf grasses 3aAfrica 3aAustralia 3aMiddle East1 aAkamine, Hikaru1 aLoch, D.

In the cross L7 × M22, The native parent line L7 was used as the receiver parent while the commercial Maradol (M22) was used as the donor parent, seeking to generate genotypes with improved productivity and reduced plant height. Cluster analysis and principal components analysis grouped the genotypes firstly into those individuals with few fruits and those with many fruits and secondly into individuals with high and low plant height. Selected genotypes H13B, H17B, H19B, H68B, and H71B meet the desirable characteristics, such as reduced plant height (PH) and intermediate number of fruits per plant (NFP). These materials can be used now to produce new crosses to continue with the ongoing breeding program at CICY, seeking new varieties with higher productivity and adequate plant height, and also these genotypes will be preserved and integrated in the germplasm bank in situ and in vitro for further genetic work and possible exchange with other germplasm collections worldwide.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCarica papaya 3abreeding programs 3acenter of origin 3acluster analysis 3acrossing 3acultivars 3afruits 3agenotype 3agermplasm 3agermplasm conservation 3alandraces 3anew variety 3apapayas 3aprincipal component analysis 3aMexico1 aZavala León, Manuel Jesús1 aContreras Martín, Fernando Amilcar1 aEspadas y Gil, Francisco1 aNavarrete Yabur, Abelardo1 aSánchez Teyer, Lorenzo Felipe1 aSantamaría, Jorge M.2 aConsejo Nacional de Ciencia y TecnologíaeFunder0 tJournal of botany.g2014, v. 2014dHindawi Pub.

However, differentiating among thematicallydetailed urban land uses (residential, commercial, industrial, institutional, recreational, etc.) over broad areas is challenging, in part because image-based solutions are not ideal for establishing the contextual basis for identifying economic function and use. At present no current United States national-scale mapping exists for urban land uses similar to the classical Anderson Level II classification. This paper describes a product that maps urban land uses, and is linked to and corresponds with the National Land Cover Database (NLCD) 2006. In this product, NLCD urban pixels, in addition to their current imperviousness intensity classification, are assigned one of nine urban use classes based on information drawn from multiple data sources. These sources include detailed infrastructure information, population characteristics, and historical land use. The result is a method for creating a 30 m national-scale grid providing thematically-detailed urban land use information which complements the NLCD.

Causal fungal agents colonize various components of the field during their life cycle including previous crop residues, soil, and grains. Although soil and residues constitute the main inoculum source, these components have received much less attention than grains. This study aimed at disentangling the role of previous crop residues in shaping soil microbiota, including Fusarium spp. communities, in fields under wheat–maize rotation. Such knowledge may contribute to better understand the complex interactions between Fusarium spp. and soil microbiota. Dynamics of bacterial and fungal communities, with a special focus on Fusarium spp., were monitored in soils at 3 time points: during wheat cultivation (April 2015 and 2017) and after maize harvest (November 2016) and in maize residues taken from fields after harvest. Shifts in microbiota were also evaluated under mesocosm experiments using soils amended with maize residues. Fusarium graminearum and F. avenaceum were predominant on maize residues but did not remain in soils during wheat cultivation. Differences in soil bacterial diversity and compositions among years were much lower than variation between fields, suggesting that bacterial communities are field-specific and more conserved over time. In contrast, soil fungal diversity and compositions were more influenced by sampling time. Maize residues, left after harvest, led to a soil enrichment with several fungal genera, including Epicoccum, Fusarium, Vishniacozyma, Papiliotrema, Sarocladium, Xenobotryosphaeria, Ramularia, Cladosporium, Cryptococcus, and Bullera, but not with bacterial genera. Likewise, under mesocosm conditions, the addition of maize residues had a stronger influence on fungal communities than on bacterial communities. In particular, addition of maize significantly increased soil fungal richness, while bacteria were much less prone to changes. Based on co-occurrence networks, OTUs negatively correlated to Fusarium spp. were identified, such as those assigned to Epicoccum and Vishniacozyma. Altogether, our results allowed to gain a deeper insight into the complex microbiota interactions in soils, with bacteria and fungi responding differently to environmental disturbances.  aPublisher supplied data  aGrant#9097 MycoRescRégion Bretagne 3aCladosporium 3aEpicoccum 3aFusarium graminearum 3aFusarium head blight 3aRamularia 3aSarocladium 3aVishniacozyma 3acorn 3ainoculum 3asoil 3asoil bacteria 3asoil fungi 3awheat1 aLegrand, Fabienne1 aLe Floch, Gaétan1 aPicot, Adeline0 tMicrobial ecology.g2022 Apr., v. 83, no. 3 p.702-713dSpringer USwJournal:jnl46274x0095-36287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00248-021-01797-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02553naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004900092040001800141100002000159245010800179300001800287500000900305500001500314520142300329592002801752650003701780650001501817650002301832650002001855650000901875650001801884650001701902653000901919700001901928773015101947852000902098856009602107655001202203IND2051789520221120202428.0191125e199409  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205178952DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1994.03615995005800050010x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCampbell, C.

The effects of borehole preparation techniques and initial soil-water pressure on Kfₛ were analyzed in this study. Eighty boreholes were studied in a strongly structured clayey soil (a fine, mixed, mesic Typic Hapludalf). A version of the borehole permeameter method was used to measure Kfₛ in soil that was initially at soil-water pressures of 0, −0.016, −0.050 and −0.080 MPa. Three different borehole excavation techniques were also studied to determine the effect on Kfₛ of soil smearing during borehole preparation. The treatments consisted of removing a uniform thickness of soil from the sides of the borehole with an ice pick, scarifying the sides of the borehole with a wire brush, and no treatment. Field-saturated hydraulic conductivity for the brushed treatments was similar to Kfₛ values obtained when no treatment was used. The ice pick method resulted in significantly higher Kfₛ. When Kfₛ values measured using the ice pick method were analyzed, no significant effect of initial soil-water pressure was evident. This could possibly be due to soil variability.

The experimental results showed that adding 1.0 % CSG increased the freezing rate and shortened the freezing time by 42.3 % compared with gluten without CSG. At the same time, CSG had no significant effect on the composition of the gluten subunit but could better control the change in binding water and delay the structural deterioration caused by the extension of time (30 d). The viscoelasticity of gluten was increased, but only with the addition of 0.2–0.6 % CSG. In addition, it increased the denaturation transition temperature (Tp) and the degradation temperature (Td) of gluten protein to reduce the occurrence of recrystallization and resist pyrolysis. During frozen storage, gluten can form fine ice crystals and inhibit the transformation of α-helices and β-turns to random coils and β-sheets, which is more conducive to long-term frozen storage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalvia hispanica 3acrystallization 3adenaturation 3afrozen storage 3agluten 3aice 3aplant gums 3apyrolysis 3atemperature 3aviscoelasticity 0aChia seed gum 0aGluten protein 0aMicrostructure1 aGao, Haiyan1 aZeng, Jie1 aLiu, Yufen0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2022 Nov. 30, v. 221 p.1093-1102dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2022.09.067  aDNAL 7aarticle02376naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001600153245010100169300001600270520140200286592002801688653000701716653001201723653003601735653003001771700001601801700001601817700001301833700001601846773010401862856008701966852000902053655001202062IND60594079220221119100438.0180510e20160920xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059407922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.electacta.2016.07.1222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Yundang10apH dependence of quinone-mediated extracellular electron transfer in a bioelectrochemical system  ap. 408-415.  aQuinone-mediated extracellular electron transfer (EET) is a well-known and important microbial respiration process in many natural and engineering systems. While it has been recognized that both the speciation of quinones and cell metabolism are pH-sensitive, the pH dependence of quinone-mediated EET is still unclear. In this study, pH effects in the range of 6.2 to 7.8 were investigated in a bioelectrochemical system using 9,10-anthraquinone-2-sulfonic acid (AQS) as a model quinone. The results showed that the current generation increased at pH 6.2–6.8 and then tended to stabilize, with a slight decrease at pH 7.0–7.8. The open circuit voltage (OCV) changed in a similar manner as a function of pH. The cell growth after current generation at different pH values was also indicated by the total DNA, which increased at pH 6.2–6.8 and then decreased at pH 7.0–7.8. Thermodynamic calculations and cyclic voltammetry measurements indicated that the redox potentials of AQS were negatively correlated with pH. At pH 6.2–7.0, both cell growth and the AQS redox properties had positive effects; at pH 7.0–7.8, while the AQS redox properties still had a positive impact on the EET capacity, the decline in the cell density slowed the increase of the EET capacity. These results provide a fundamental understanding of quinone-mediated EET processes and emphasize the importance of pH.  aPublisher supplied data 0apH 0aquinone 0aextracellular electron transfer 0abioelectrochemical system1 aLi, Fangbai1 aLiu, Tongxu1 aHan, Rui1 aLuo, Xiaobo0 tElectrochimica acta.g2016 Sept. 20, v. 213 p.408-415dElsevier LtdwJournal:26735x0013-46867nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.electacta.2016.07.1223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02677naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005800150245011900208300001600327520134400343592002801687650001301715650001101728650002801739650002001767650001801787650001101805650001701816650002901833650001001862653002201872653002401894653003601918653003101954700001701985700002002002700005402022773009702076856008502173852000902258655001202267IND60634735320221118115949.0190913e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063473532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2019.02.0732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalimzadeh, S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7111-971X12aA novel radial jet drilling stimulation technique for enhancing heat recovery from fractured geothermal reservoirs  ap. 395-409.  aIn this study, the application of the Radial Jet Drilling (RJD), a novel stimulating technique for enhancing productivity in the existing wells in deformable naturally fractured reservoirs was investigated using a robust three-dimensional finite element DFM (discrete fracture-matrix) model. Results showed that the RJD laterals were more effective in enhancing injectivity/productivity in cases with lower fracture density, i.e. lower equivalent permeability, while they had no significant effect on the heat production in these cases. In higher fracture density cases, the RJD laterals improved the heat production while had no significant effect on the injectivity/productivity. Results also showed that in reservoirs with very low permeability matrix, the RJD laterals can be used to connect the wells to the fracture network and hence enhance the well performance. The sensitivity analysis on the average net energy production rate with respect to the length of the RJD laterals showed that in the situations where the wells were not connected directly to the fractures, the length of RJD laterals played a crucial role in enhancing the average net energy rate. However, the 100 m laterals almost removed the dependency of the average net energy production rate on the well placement for low, medium and high fracture density cases.  aPublisher supplied data 3adrilling 3aenergy 3afinite element analysis 3aheat production 3aheat recovery 3amodels 3apermeability 3arenewable energy sources 3awells 0aCoupled processes 0aRadial jet drilling 0aFractured geothermal reservoirs 0aNet energy production rate1 aGrandahl, M.1 aMedetbekova, M.1 aNick, H.M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4705-49300 tRenewable energy.g2019 Aug., v. 139 p.395-409dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2019.02.0733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02411naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100003100154245011900185506002800304520131900332592002801651506003701679653001801716653001601734653001301750653001501763653002101778700002101799700002901820700002501849773011301874856008901987852000902076655001202085IND60785247720221207094345.0200109s2019    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078524772DNAL7 a10.17268/sci.agropecu.2019.04.072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuevara-Sánchez, Maricely10aEfecto de la altitud en la calidad del café (Coffea arabica L.): comparación entre secado mecanico y tradicional  aResource is Open Access  aEl café es una de las bebidas de mayor consumo en el mundo entero.

El objetivo de este estudio fue evaluar el efecto de dos tipos de secado (mecánico y tradicional) en cinco altitudes sobre la calidad del café. La investigación se realizó en el valle del Alto Mayo, región San Martín, Perú. Se seleccionaron cinco fincas a diferentes altitudes (873, 1079, 1248, 1348, 1430 m.s.n.m.). El prototipo utilizado funciona mediante un sistema de túneles de calor térmico, construido con un micas solares y calaminas. Fueron extraídas 150 muestras de 1kg cada una. Las variables evaluadas fueron las características físicas y organolépticas del grano seco y el número de días de secado. Los resultados mostraron que no existieron diferencias significativas para ningún parámetro evaluado entre las altitudes seleccionadas. No obstante, existieron diferencias significativas para los parámetros de humedad y grano de primera categoría donde el secado mecánico fue superior. También, para el caso de la calidad organoléptica, el secado mecánico se presentó como mejor opción, indicando que su uso puede optimizar la calidad organoléptica del café.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 0asecador solar 0apos-cosecha 0aarábica 0aSan Martin 0aPaneles solares.1 aBernales, Carlos1 aSaavedra-Ramírez, Jorge1 aOwaki-López, Johnny0 tScientia agropecuaria.g2019, v. 10, no. 4dUniversidad Nacional de TrujillowJournal:27801x2306-67417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17268/sci.agropecu.2019.04.073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02869naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245017000168300001600338520106000354592002801414650001601442650001901458650001101477650001201488650000901500650001301509653001801522653001101540653001401551653001001565700006001575700002301635700005801658700001501716700002101731700002101752700005601773700005901829700002401888700007601912700001701988700006902005700006302074773014602137856008302283852000902366655001202375IND60712940820221121222546.0211009e20201217xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071294082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.09.0842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFédou, Camille14aThe low affinity p75 neurotrophin receptor is down-regulated in congenital anomalies of the kidney and the urinary tract: Possible involvement in early nephrogenesis  ap. 786-791.  aCongenital Anomalies of the Kidney and of the Urinary Tract (CAKUT) cover a broad range of disorders including abnormal kidney development caused by defective nephrogenesis. Here we explored the possible involvement of the low affinity p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) in CAKUT and nephrogenesis. In mouse, p75NTR was highly expressed in fetal kidney, located within cortical early nephrogenic bodies, and decreased rapidly after birth. In human control fetal kidney, p75NTR was also located within the early nephrogenic bodies as well as in the mature glomeruli, presumably in the mesangium. In CAKUT fetal kidneys, the kidney cortical structure and the localization of p75NTR were often disorganized, and quantification of p75NTR in amniotic fluid revealed a significant reduction in CAKUT compared to control. Finally, invalidation of p75NTR in zebrafish embryo with an antisense morpholino significantly altered pronephros development. Our results indicate that renal p75NTR is altered in CAKUT fetuses, and could participate to early nephrogenesis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDanio rerio 3aamniotic fluid 3ahumans 3akidneys 3amice 3aresearch 0aNephrogenesis 0ap75NTR 0aZebrafish 0aCAKUT1 aLescat, Ophélie1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6925-26581 aFeuillet, Guylène1 aBuléon, Marie1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6117-55151 aNeau, Eric1 aBreuil, Benjamin1 aAlvès, Mélinda1 aBatut, Julie1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1984-20941 aBlader, Patrick1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3299-61081 aDecramer, Stéphane1 aSaulnier-Blache, Jean Sébastien1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8971-77231 aKlein, Julie1 aBuffin-Meyer, Bénédicte1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4805-15581 aSchanstra, Joost P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7471-372X0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2020 Dec. 17, v. 533, no. 4 p.786-791dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.09.0843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02720naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245016400169300001600333520110400349592002801453596003101481650002001512650001101532650001801543650001101561650001301572650002001585650002001605650001501625650001501640650001101655650001501666650001201681650001701693650002301710650001601733650001801749650001101767650001401778650001501792651001001807651001801817653001801835653002801853653001201881653001501893700001601908700001401924773013401938856008502072852000902157655001202166IND60614846620221122222019.0181002e20180925xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061484662DNAL7 a10.2989/16085914.2018.14902442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbong’o, DA10aOccurrence and distribution of organochlorine pesticide residue levels in water, sediment and aquatic weeds in the Nyando River catchment, Lake Victoria, Kenya  ap. 255-270.  aSamples of water, sediments and aquatic weeds were collected from 26 sites in the Nyando River catchment of the Lake Victoria basin in 2005–2006. The objective was to investigate levels of organochlorine pesticides that have either been banned or are restricted for use in Kenya. The pesticides investigated were lindane, aldrin, endosulfan, endrin, dieldrin, DDT, heptachlor and methoxychlor. These pesticides had previously found wide applications in public health and agriculture in Kenya for control of disease vectors and crop pests respectively. Results showed that mean concentrations were highest for methoxychlor (8.817 ± 0.020 µg l⁻¹) in water, sediments (92.893 ± 3.039 µg kg⁻¹), and weeds (39.641 ± 3.045 µg kg⁻¹), the weeds also tended to accumulate aldrin (15.519 ± 3.756 µg kg⁻¹). The results show that the pesticides are still in use and are detected in the catchment. Stringent management and public awareness measures are required to enforce the ban on the organochlorine pesticides in order to safeguard the environment and ecosystems of Lake Victoria.  aPublisher supplied data  cDr. Deborah Atieno Abong'o 3aDDT (pesticide) 3aaldrin 3aaquatic weeds 3abasins 3adieldrin 3adisease control 3adisease vectors 3aecosystems 3aendosulfan 3aendrin 3aheptachlor 3alindane 3amethoxychlor 3apesticide residues 3aplant pests 3apublic health 3arivers 3asediments 3awatersheds 3aKenya 3aLake Victoria 0aAgrochemicals 0aenvironmental pollution 0afarming 0aWinam Gulf1 aWandiga, SO1 aJumba, IO0 tAfrican journal of aquatic science.g2018 Sept. 25, v. 43, no. 3 p.255-270dTaylor & FranciswJournal:J000000041x1727-93647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2989/16085914.2018.14902443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05731naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100003100112245020400143300001600347506002800363520396700391592002804358506003704386650002004423650001704443650001304460650001204473650001204485650001404497650001204511650002104523650001704544650001204561650001404573650001504587650002004602650000904622650001504631650001404646650001304660650001604673650001104689650002504700650001804725650000904743651001104752653002904763653002404792653004404816653002804860653002104888653002304909700003804932700003704970773012505007852000905132655001205141IND60785247820221207094352.0110430e200906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078524782DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQueiroga, Vicente de Paula10aecnologias sobre operações de semeadura e colheita para a cultura do gergelim (Sesamum indicum L.) = Technologies on operations of sowing and harvest for the culture of sesame (Sesamum indicum L.).  ap. 106-121.  aResource is Open Access  aO gergelim (Sesamum indicum L .) é uma das primeiras espécies domesticadas pelo homem, sendo na atualidade uma das dez principais oleaginosas do mundo. Cultivado em uma área total em torno de oito milhões de hectares, o principal produto do gergelim é a semente. De elevado valor nutricional para alimentação humana, e de propriedades medicinais, as sementes do gergelim são fontes de vitaminas (complexo B), ricas em minerais (cálcio, fósforo, magnésio, sodio, zinco e selênio), de óleo (50%) composto por ácidos graxos insaturados oléico, 40% e linoléico, 41%) e substâncias antioxidantes como a sesamina, a sesamolina e o tocoferol que imprimem resistência a ranciﬁ cação. A t orta ou farelo do gergelim é rica em aminoácidos importantes, tais como metionina, cistina, arginina e leucina tornando-se uma excelente fonte de proteínas (39%). O gergelim é uma planta de fácil cultivo com cultivares de ciclo rápido, entre 90 a 130 dias. Informações contidas nesta nota técnica podem contribuir para o agronegócio do gergelim e para a produção em pequena escala, explorando o potencial do gergelim numa grande perspectiva de atividade econômica, especialmente para o Semi-Árido do Nordeste, ou como “cultura de safrinha” nas condições do Cerrado. Objetivou-se destacar as seguintes tecnologias adaptadas ao cultivo do gergelim: diferentes plantadeiras, importância da colheita sincronizada, diferentes formas de trilha e secagem. Demonstra-se que a simples introdução da segadora-atadora (rendimento de 2 ha homens -1) para realizar o corte das plantas, no ponto de colheita poderá incrementar signiﬁ cativamente a área plantada de gergelim no Brasil, mesmo com as cultivares de gergelim deiscente em uso. A verticalização da produção do gergelim ﬁ ca na dependência das modiﬁ cações dos costumes alimentares e sociais da população, pois o mercado nacional é limitado e por este motivo não valoriza tanto a qualidade do gergelim como o mercado internacional. Atualmente, mais de 60% do consumo de gergelim no Brasil é importado. = - The sesame (Sesamum indicum L.) is one of the ﬁ rst species domesticated by humans, being nowadays one of the top ten oil plant in the world. Planted in an area around eight million hectares, the main product is the sesame seed. High nutritional value for food, and medicinal properties of sesame seeds are sources of vitamins (B vitamins), rich in minerals (calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, sodium, zinc and selenium), oil (50%) composed of unsaturated fatty acids (oleic (40%) and linoleic (41%)) and antioxidants such as sesamin, the sesamoline the tocopherol that print resistance to rancidity. Sesame presscake has important amino acids such as methionine, cystine, arginine and leucine becoming an excellent source of protein (39%). The sesame is easy to grow and has fast cycle cultivars, between 90-130 days. Information contained in this technical note can contribute to agribusiness and the small scale production, exploring the potential of sesame in a big picture of economic activity, especially for the semiarid Northeast, or as a “culture of off season in terms of the Brazilian Cerrado. Aimed to highlight the following technologies adapted to the cultivation of sesame: different planters, the importance of synchronized sampling, different ways to track and drying. It is shown that the mere introduction of the mower-knotters yield (2 ha men-1)to perform the cutting of plants at harvest time can signiﬁ cantly increase the area planted to sesame in Brazil, even with the dehiscent sesame cultivars planted. The vertical integration of production of sesame is the dependence of changes in dietary and social habits of the population, because the domestic market is limited and for this reason can not appreciate both the quality of sesame as the international market. Currently, over 60% of consumption of sesame seeds in Brazil is imported.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSesamum indicum 3aagribusiness 3aarginine 3acalcium 3acerrado 3acultivars 3acystine 3adomestic markets 3aharvest date 3aleucine 3amagnesium 3amethionine 3anutritive value 3aoils 3aphosphorus 3arancidity 3aselenium 3asesame seed 3asodium 3avertical integration 3aworld markets 3azinc 3aBrazil 0aColheita semi-mecanizada 0aSemeadura mecânica 0aVariedade deiscente. =  Sesamum indicum 0aHalf-mechanized harvest 0aSowing mechanics 0aDehiscent variety.1 aTarcísio Marcos de Souza Gondim,1 aqueiroga, Diego Antonio Nóbrega0 tAgro@mbiente on-line.g2009 June, v. 3, no. 2 p.106-121dUniversidade Federal de RoraimawJournal:27788x1982-84707nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02012naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245011800162300001800280520081400298592002801112650002501140650001301165650002201178650001601200650001901216650002201235650001001257650001101267650002201278650002401300650001301324650001101337650003001348700001501378700002201393773011601415856007401531852000901605655001201614IND60437267220221120024409.0151022e200007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043726722DNAL7 a10.1007/PL000007502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLe Chevalier*, P.10aMolecular cloning of a cDNA encoding alpha-glucosidase in the digestive gland of the shrimp, Litopenaeus vannamei  ap. 1135-1143.  aThe complete sequence of the 3-kb cDNA and the 5′ genomic structure are reported for the gene encoding the shrimp alpha-glucosidase.

Following validation over natural oil seeps and at Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement’s (BSEE’s) Ohmsett test tank, the system was utilized operationally on a near-daily basis for three months during the Deepwater Horizon (MC-252) spill in the Gulf of Mexico in summer 2010. Digital, GIS-compatible analyses were produced and disseminated following each flight mission. The analysis products were utilized for a multitude of response activities including daily offshore oil recovery planning, oil trajectory modeling, dispersant application effect documentation, beached oil mapping and documentation of the relative oil amount along the spill’s offshore perimeter. The system’s prime limitation was its relatively narrow imaging footprint and low sun angle requirement to minimize sunglint, both of which limited the total area that could be imaged each day. This paper discusses the system’s various applications as well as limitations that were encountered during its use in the Deepwater Horizon incident.</i></p>  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputer software 3aimage analysis 3amodels 3aoil spills 3aoils 3aplanning 3aremote sensing 3asummer 3aGulf of Mexico1 aLehr, William1 aMuskat, Judd1 aGraettinger, George1 aMullin, Joseph0 tPhotogrammetric engineering and remote sensing.g2012 Oct. 1, v. 78, no. 10 p.1089-1102dAmerican Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensingx0099-11127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.14358%2FPERS.78.10.10893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02296naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245009000162520117100252592002801423650001701451650001901468650003001487650001001517650002401527650002201551650002201573650001501595650000901610650002301619650002101642700002301663700001601686700001901702773011901721856007301840852000901913655001201922IND60653399820221119080324.0190714e20180826xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065339982DNAL7 a10.3390/w100911412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCavazza, Francesco14aThe Role of ICT in Improving Sequential Decisions for Water Management in Agriculture  aNumerous Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) applications have been developed in irrigated agriculture. While there are studies focusing on ICTs impacts at the farm level, no research deals with this issue at the Water Authority (WA) level where ICTs can support strategic decisions on land and water allocation. The present study aims to design a theoretical model to estimate economic benefits from the ICT-informed decision process of water management in agriculture. Specifically, the study analyzes the motivations driving a case study WA using ICTs to support strategic management decisions involving risky choices. Results show that the WA under investigation has potentialities to save water and to implement adaptation strategies to climate change. Higher benefits from ICTs are attainable in areas with limited water availability and where the WA can effectively manage land allocation and control water delivery volumes. The study concludes that ICTs might have a disruptive potential in fulfilling WA&rsquo;s specific information needs, but there is still a need to improve their accuracy due to the risk surrounding the decisions at stake.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3aclimate change 3acommunications technology 3afarms 3afinancial economics 3ainformation needs 3airrigated farming 3amotivation 3arisk 3atheoretical models 3awater allocation1 aGalioto, Francesco1 aRaggi, Meri1 aViaggi, Davide0 tWater.g2018 Aug. 26, v. 10, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w100911413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02116naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001500141245011400156300001500270506002800285520097500313592002801288506003701316650001901353650001401372650001601386653001901402653002001421653002301441653001901464653001401483700001801497700002001515773013401535856007601669852000901745655001201754IND60785248020221207094337.0090701e199508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078524802DNAL7 a10.15835/nbha2513192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPUIA, Ioan14aThe position of agricultural ecosystems among the ecosystems of contemporary biosphere and their productivity  ap. 99-108.  aResource is Open Access  aThe authors divide the ecosystems of contemporary biosphere into two great series: A) the series of natural ecosystems and B) the series of man-made ecosystems (see fig.1) may be separated according to the amount of energy that may circulate through (the so called energy flux). Natural ecosystems may have a lower or a higher energy flux. Man-made ecosystems have a comparatively higher flux, but some of them (some silvo-systems, agro-ecosystems, and water ecosystems controlled by man) are productive from a biological point of view whereas others (the ones in villages, towns, as well as other kind of systems built up by man) are great consumers of organic substances and other natural resources. A classification of agro-ecosystems according to the output/input ratio of "cultural energy" is evinced (see fig. 2). The authors distinguish three groups of agro-ecosystems: I) Industrial agro-ecosystems; II) Intensive agro-ecosystems; III) Extensive agro-ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aagroecosystems 3abiosphere 3aenergy flow 0aagro-ecosystem 0acultural energy 0aman-made ecosystem 0aclassification 0aecosystem1 aSORAN, Vasile1 aCHIRCA, Eugenia0 tNotulae botanicae Horti Agrobotanici Cluj-Napoca.g1995 Aug., v. 25, no. 1 p.99-108dAcademicPreswJournal:21431x1842-43097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.15835/nbha2513193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03226naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245016300162300001600325500001900341500002000360520159300380592002801973596005402001596007102055596002702126650001902153650002202172650001202194650001102206650001402217650002102231650002102252650001802273650001102291650001802302650001402320650002002334650001402354651001302368700001902381700001802400700001702418700002002435700006802455773011502523856007302638852000902711655001202720IND60722667420221121054233.0210107e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072266742DNAL7 a10.1111/ppa.132932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRashid, M.

Blackleg (Leptosphaeria maculans) causes yield losses annually, with a larger impact in the last two decades caused by breakdown of resistance in growers’ fields. A 4‐year small‐plot field study from 2014 to 2017 in Manitoba investigated the impact of the B. napus–L. maculans interaction on the emergence of virulent isolates towards specific R genes. Doubled haploid B. napus ‘Topas’ introgression lines carrying single R genes were used, with a 2‐year canola–wheat rotation. Blackleg incidence was reduced by 40% in 2017 compared to 2014 for all R genes tested except Rlm4. In 2017, disease severity was reduced between 21% and 52% compared to 2014 for all R genes tested except Rlm2. There was a significant shift from AvrLm2 and AvrLm4 to virulent alleles avrLm2 and avrLm4, respectively, which led to the gain of virulence toward Rlm2 and Rlm4 Topas introgression lines within a year. Sequencing of the AvrLm2 gene of isolates from 2014 and 2015 revealed a shift of AvrLm2 to avrLm2 allele due to accumulation of point mutations. Masking of AvrLm3 phenotype by the presence of the AvrLm4‐7 allele was also confirmed by analysing phenotypes and genotypes of the isolates collected from 2014 to 2017. Based on these and previous findings, we demonstrate the need for an epidemiological model that takes into account complex molecular mechanisms allowing plant breeders to select appropriate R genes, including balanced cultivar rotation strategies to maintain blackleg resistance in the Canadian Prairies.  aPublisher supplied data  a33321cSaskatchewan Canola Development Commission  a22066cNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada  cUniversity of Manitoba 3aBrassica napus 3aPlenodomus lingam 3aalleles 3acanola 3acultivars 3adisease severity 3adoubled haploids 3aintrogression 3amodels 3aoilseed crops 3aphenotype 3aplant pathology 3avirulence 3aManitoba1 aLiban, Sakaria1 aZhang, Xuehua1 aParks, Paula1 aBorhan, Hossein1 aFernando, W.

The films have been characterized with an emphasis on determining the film quality and relating the structure, composition, and morphology to the resulting electrochemical and morphological transformations that occur during electrochemical lithiation and delithiation. It is shown that electrodeposition can produce high quality films that are devoid of major defects and can be used to provide mechanistic insight on the electrochemistry of reversible lithium alloying. The CuxSb films show that the fundamental reaction mechanism remains largely unchanged for copper concentrations of 1>x>3. For the first time we show that the copper concentration greatly affects critical criteria for anode materials such as the initial coulombic efficiency and reversible capacity of the electrode material. Voltage limit experiments show that an overpotential is required to remove trapped lithium states. Additional ex-situ experiments reveal that internal strain created during the lithiation process is relieved by buckling, greatly altering the film surface area and geometry, and resulting in the formation of cracks upon delithiation. This process is only semi-reversible, and strained areas remain visible even when discharged outside the voltage window of Cu2Sb determined by differential capacity plots. The results presented here indicate that these electroplated thin films are useful as analytical tools for showing pathways to improving the performance and fundamental understanding of alloy based lithium-ion battery anodes.  aPublisher supplied data 0aCopper antimonide 0aAlloy anode 0aThin film electrode1 aMosby, James M.1 aPrieto, Amy L.0 tElectrochimica acta.g2016 Oct. 01, v. 214 p.253-264dElsevier LtdwJournal:26735x0013-46867nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.electacta.2016.07.1263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02446naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002100141245009500162500001500257520108600272592002801358650002601386650001301412650001001425650001101435650001201446650001301458650001001471650002001481650002001501650001101521650001001532650000901542650000801551650001701559650001601576650001001592650001901602650001201621650001601633651001101649653001901660700002701679700002501706700002001731773010501751856007501856852000901931655001201940IND60536718220221119191759.0160806s2014    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053671822DNAL7 a10.1155/2014/7501532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCostanzo, Jon P.10aSeasonality of Freeze Tolerance in a Subarctic Population of the Wood Frog, Rana sylvatica  a2019-12-06  aWe compared physiological characteristics and responses to experimental freezing and thawing in winter and spring samples of the wood frog, Rana sylvatica , indigenous to Interior Alaska, USA. Whereas winter frogs can survive freezing at temperatures at least as low as −16°C, the lower limit of tolerance for spring frogs was between −2.5°C and −5°C. Spring frogs had comparatively low levels of the urea in blood plasma, liver, heart, brain, and skeletal muscle, as well as a smaller hepatic reserve of glycogen, which is converted to glucose after freezing begins. Consequently, following freezing (−2.5°C, 48 h) tissue concentrations of these cryoprotective osmolytes were 44–88% lower than those measured in winter frogs. Spring frogs formed much more ice and incurred extensive cryohemolysis and lactate accrual, indicating that they had suffered marked cell damage and hypoxic stress during freezing. Multiple, interactive stresses, in addition to diminished cryoprotectant levels, contribute to the reduced capacity for freeze tolerance in posthibernal frogs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLithobates sylvaticus 3afreezing 3aliver 3awinter 3aglucose 3aglycogen 3abrain 3askeletal muscle 3acryoprotectants 3aspring 3afrogs 3aurea 3aice 3ablood plasma 3atemperature 3aheart 3acold tolerance 3athawing 3alactic acid 3aAlaska 0aRana sylvatica1 ado Amaral, M.

The fin-like structure can reabsorb the reflected solar energy while the light-trapping nanostructured coating can increase solar absorption and reduce infrared emissivity. A multi-scale numerical model is developed to evaluate the receiver's optical and thermal performance. It is found that the multi-scale solar receiver can achieve a receiver efficiency of 0.904 at the solar time of 12:00 on spring equinox. However, it is also found that the maximum film temperature of the leading-edge tube will exceed 800 °C, which may decompose the current nitrate salt. To solve this problem, a white coating is used for leading-edge tubes to reduce the temperature by decreasing the maximum heat flux. The results show that this method can effectively regulate the overheating of the leading-edge tube. The maximum film temperature was successfully reduced to less than 800 °C at nearly no expenses of the absorbed solar energy. The study provides a new sight to achieve a receiver efficiency of more than 0.9 for the next generation concentrating solar power plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aenergy 3aheat transfer 3amathematical models 3anitrates 3apower plants 3asolar collectors 3asolar energy 3aspring 3atemperature 0aConcentrating solar power 0aHigh-temperature receiver 0aMacroscale fin-like structure 0aNanoscale light-trapping coating1 aHe, Ya-Ling1 aJiang, Rui0 tRenewable energy.g2022 Sept. 28, dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2022.09.122  aDNAL 7aarticle03053naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245014600154300001800300520155400318592002801872650004401900650001501944650001701959650001301976650001401989650002102003650002002024650002002044650002302064650001602087650002502103650001902128650001302147650001702160650003302177650000902210650002702219650001302246650002302259700001802282700001402300700001802314700001602332773012802348856007402476852000902550655001202559IND60657859520221116213417.0190816e20150724xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065785952DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ay00281h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yan10aMolecularly imprinted solid-phase extraction coupled with gas chromatography for the determination of four chloroacetamide herbicides in soil  ap. 6411-6418.  aA molecularly imprinted solid phase extraction (MISPE) coupled with gas chromatography (GC) for the simultaneous separation and determination of four chloroacetamide herbicides, alachlor, acetochlor, pretilachlor and metolachlor, in soil was developed. Molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) with butachlor as the dummy template were synthesized via precipitation polymerization, where methacrylic acid (MAA) was used as the functional monomer, ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EDMA) as the crosslinker and acetonitrile as the porogen. Fourier-transform infrared spectrometry (FTIR) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were used to characterize the polymers. Under the optimum SPE conditions, the polymer sorbents can selectively extract and enrich alachlor, acetochlor, pretilachlor and metolachlor. A comparison experiment also showed that the MISPE cartridges were better than the nonimprinted and C18 cartridges in terms of recovery. The mean recoveries of the four chloroacetamide herbicides from blank soil spiked at 0.1, 0.5, and 1 μg mL⁻¹ ranged between 80.6 and 90.2% with relative standard deviations (RSD) of less than 8% (n = 5). The limit of detection (LOD) and the limit of quantification (LOQ) of the four analytes were in the range of 1.0 × 10⁻¹² to 5 × 10⁻¹¹ g and 0.0005–0.025 mg kg⁻¹, respectively. The presented MISPE-GC method exhibited highly selective separation and enrichment of trace chloroacetamide herbicides and could be potentially applied to the determination of chloroacetamide herbicides in soil.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aacetochlor 3aacetonitrile 3aalachlor 3abutachlor 3achemical species 3adetection limit 3aethylene glycol 3agas chromatography 3ametolachlor 3amolecular imprinting 3apolymerization 3apolymers 3apretilachlor 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asoil 3asolid phase extraction 3asorbents 3astandard deviation1 aJin, Xiaoyang1 aZhao, Dan1 aGuo, Xiaohong1 aLi, Ranhong0 tAnalytical methods.g2015 July 24, v. 7, no. 15 p.6411-6418dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ay00281h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02365naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001100147245011500158520099800273592002801271650001801299650002201317650002501339650000901364650003501373650001001408650001601418650001501434650002901449650001901478650001201497653001001509653000801519653001501527653000901542653001801551653001601569653002201585653001801607700001901625700005101644773012101695856008201816852000901898655001201907IND60709387820221116142357.0210820e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070938782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dci.2020.1038462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Li10aIRF11 regulates positively type I IFN transcription and antiviral response in mandarin fish, Siniperca chuatsi  aIn vertebrates, a total of eleven interferon (IFN) regulatory factors (IRFs), IRF1 to IRF11 are reported, with the conserved presence of IRF1 to IRF9 in all classes of vertebrates. However, IRF10 has been reported only in fish and birds, and IRF11 seems to be a fish specific IRF member. In this study, IRF11 in mandarin fish Siniperca chuatsi was found upregulated following virus infection, and IRF11 was localized constitutively in nucleus as revealed through immunofluorescence test. The overexpression and/or luciferase reporter assays showed that IRF11 can induce transcriptionally the ISRE activity, and the expression of type I IFNs, IFNc and IFNh, as well as the IFN-stimulated gene, Mx, thus inhibiting the Siniperca chuatsi rhabdovirus (SCRV) replication as indicated in the reduced expression of virus protein genes. It is thus suggested that IRF11 in mandarin fish and probably in other teleost fish can exert its antiviral effect through the upregulation of type I IFNs and ISGs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRhabdoviridae 3aSiniperca chuatsi 3aantiviral properties 3afish 3afluorescent antibody technique 3agenes 3ainterferons 3aluciferase 3atranscription (genetics) 3aviral proteins 3aviruses 0aIRF11 0aIFN 0aType I IFN 0aISRE 0aTranscription 0aRhabdovirus 0aSiniperca chuatsi 0aMandarin fish1 aChen, Shan Nan1 aNie, P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9492-29400 tDevelopmental and comparative immunology.g2021 Jan., v. 114 p.103846-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11789x0145-305X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dci.2020.1038463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03463naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245015600170520198100326592002802307650001202335650001902347650002102366650001902387650001202406650001002418650001602428650001102444650001802455650001402473650001402487650001702501650002502518650000902543651001002552653002102562653002402583653001902607653002602626653002002652653001402672700001302686700001902699700001702718700001802735773011002753856008502863852000902948655001202957IND60766017820221122051346.0220523e20220415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076601782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2022.1189092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yongdong10aGeochemical records of Lake Erhai (South-Western China) reveal the anthropogenically-induced intensification of hypolimnetic anoxia in monomictic lakes  aIn monomictic lakes, hypolimnetic anoxia is becoming severe in extent and duration over the past few decades. Understanding historical trends in hypolimnetic dissolved oxygen (DO) levels and the factors controlling them is crucial for effective protection and management of monomictic lakes everywhere, but the issue remains little studied in China. Here, our study elucidated the variation of hypolimnion DO and organic matter (OM) input in Lake Erhai (a typical monomictic lake in South-Western China) during the past 200 years, by using the geochemical profiles of elements (C, N, P, S, Mo, Ca, and Al) and aliphatic hydrocarbons in a dated sediment core. The values of element proxies (S concentrations, S/Al ratios, Mo enrichment factor, and total organic carbon/total P ratios) and pristane/phytane (Pr/Ph) ratios reflect relatively limited development of anoxia in the lake hypolimnion before 1990. Meanwhile, the n-alkane proxies (short-chain, middle-chain, and long-chain n-alkane abundances, n-C₁₇/n-C₁₆ alkane ratios, and Paq) indicate relatively scant inputs of OM from phytoplankton and relatively high inputs of OM from terrestrial plants or from submerged macrophytes. Taken together the results show that OM supplied in this period did not deteriorate hypolimnion DO in Lake Erhai. The element proxies and Pr/Ph ratios point to that the lake had experienced a pronounced intensification of hypolimnetic anoxia after 1990, and the n-alkane proxies indicate that the lake was susceptible to severe eutrophication and phytoplankton blooms in this period. The synchronous sharp variation implies the decay of massive phytoplankton OM had severely consumed oxygen in the lake hypolimnion. The large surface area/depth ratio in Lake Erhai is conducive for an overturn of the water column during wind disturbance, which allowed the water column stratification and relating effects (e.g., hypolimnetic anoxia) less vulnerable to some aspects of climate change.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkanes 3aclimate change 3adissolved oxygen 3aeutrophication 3ahypoxia 3alakes 3amacrophytes 3aoxygen 3aphytoplankton 3apollution 3asediments 3asurface area 3atotal organic carbon 3awind 3aChina 0aLipid biomarkers 0aHypolimnetic anoxia 0aEutrophication 0aAnthropogenic effects 0aOrganic matters 0an-Alkanes1 aFu, Huan1 aLiao, Hanliang1 aChen, Huihui1 aLiu, Zhengwen0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2022 Apr. 15, v. 299 p.118909-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2022.1189093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01957naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245006700167300001400234520087300248592002801121650001401149650000901163650001201172650001201184650001101196650001201207650001501219650001301234651001301247651001201260653002101272653002201293653001201315653001401327653000901341773011901350856008101469852000901550655001201559IND60126969120221119224312.0150428e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012696912DNAL7 a10.2993/0278-0771-32.1.302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSirén, Anders,10aFestival Hunting by the Kichwa People in the Ecuadorian Amazon  ap. 30-50.  aThe hista, a festival that blends indigenous and Catholic traditions, is an important component of the culture of the Kichwa people of the Ecuadorian Amazon, and hunting is a key part of festival preparations. In the community of Sarayaku the biomass hunted during festival hunting, calculated based on hunters reporting their catch, constitutes less than 4% of the total long-term harvest rate. However, certain species are particularly targeted during festival hunting, some of which are threatened. Particularly for woolly monkeys (Lagothrix spp.) and Salvin's Curassow (Mitu salvini), festival hunting constitutes a large proportion of total offtake. The tradition of celebrating the hista can survive into the future only if wildlife populations are conserved. This is a challenge and an interest shared by local indigenous communities and conservationists alike.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLagothrix 3aMitu 3abiomass 3ahunters 3amixing 3amonkeys 3atraditions 3awildlife 3aAmazonia 3aEcuador 0aKichwa festivals 0aEcuadorian Amazon 0ahunting 0aLagothrix 0aMitu0 tJournal of ethnobiology.g2012 July, v. 32, no. 1 p.30-50dSociety of EthnobiologywJournal:19742x2162-44967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2993/0278-0771-32.1.303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02523naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245011600170300001800286520089300304592002801197650004401225650002201269650001401291650002201305650002001327650003801347650001101385650001901396650001701415650004401432650002001476650001901496650001501515650002101530653001601551653002701567653004601594700001501640700002001655700001601675700001401691700001901705700001801724700001301742700001701755773013701772856008701909852000901996655001202005IND60676643520221122040637.0200523e20200715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067664352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2019.11.1352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChai, Hongbin14aThe fabrication of polylactide/cellulose nanocomposites with enhanced crystallization and mechanical properties  ap. 1578-1588.  aPolylactide/cellulose nanocomposites were fabricated by blending of commercial polylactide (PLA) and modified cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs).

Although flax (Linum usitatissimum L.) is one of the most important fiber and oil crops worldwide, no reports have been published describing flax miRNAs (Lus-miRNAs) induced in response to saline, alkaline, and saline-alkaline stresses. RESULTS: In this work, combined small RNA and degradome deep sequencing was used to analyze flax libraries constructed after alkaline-salt stress (AS2), neutral salt stress (NSS), alkaline stress (AS), and the non-stressed control (CK). From the CK, AS, AS2, and NSS libraries, a total of 118, 119, 122, and 120 known Lus-miRNAs and 233, 213, 211, and 212 novel Lus-miRNAs were isolated, respectively. After assessment of differential expression profiles, 17 known Lus-miRNAs and 36 novel Lus-miRNAs were selected and used to predict putative target genes. Gene ontology term enrichment analysis revealed target genes that were involved in responses to stimuli, including signaling and catalytic activity. Eight Lus-miRNAs were selected for analysis using qRT-PCR to confirm the accuracy and reliability of the miRNA-seq results. The qRT-PCR results showed that changes in stress-induced expression profiles of these miRNAs mirrored expression trends observed using miRNA-seq. Degradome sequencing and transcriptome profiling showed that expression of 29 miRNA-target pairs displayed inverse expression patterns under saline, alkaline, and saline-alkaline stresses. From the target prediction analysis, the miR398a-targeted gene codes for a copper/zinc superoxide dismutase, and the miR530 has been shown to explicitly target WRKY family transcription factors, which suggesting that these two micRNAs and their targets may significant involve in the saline, alkaline, and saline-alkaline stress response in flax. CONCLUSIONS: Identification and characterization of flax miRNAs, their target genes, functional annotations, and gene expression patterns are reported in this work. These findings will enhance our understanding of flax miRNA regulatory mechanisms under saline, alkaline, and saline-alkaline stresses and provide a foundation for future elucidation of the specific functions of these miRNAs.  aPublisher supplied data  aLRB 127555cHeilongjiang Postdoctoral Funding  a201507-41cDoctoral Scientific Research Foundation of Heilongjiang Academy of Agricultural Sciences  aCARS-19cNational Hemp Industry Technology System  a2013RFQYJ162cProject of Harbin Innovative Talents0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aLinum usitatissimum 3acatalytic activity 3acopper 3aflax 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3amicroRNA 3aoil crops 3aprediction 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asalt stress 3astress response 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 3atranscriptomics 3azinc1 aWu, Guangwen1 aYuan, Hongmei1 aCheng, Lili1 aZhao, Dongsheng1 aHuang, Wengong1 aZhang, Shuquan1 aZhang, Liguo1 aChen, Hongyu1 aZhang, Jian1 aGuan, Fengzhi0 tBMC plant biology.g2016 Dec., v. 16, no. 1 p.124-124dBioMed CentralwJournal:2167x1471-22297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12870-016-0808-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02151naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245007000171300001600241520109800257592002801355650001501383650001001398650001301408650001401421650001401435651001101449700001701460700002601477700002201503700002501525700002001550700002101570773007901591856008501670961001301755852000901768655001201777IND60088471820221122005728.0141102e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008847182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.toxicon.2012.05.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Stephen T.10aDetection of monofluoroacetate in Palicourea and Amorimia species  ap. 791-796.  aNumerous plant species worldwide including Palicourea marcgravii and Tanaecium bilabiatum in Brazil cause sudden death and are known to contain monofluoroacetate (MFA). Other species in Brazil including some species traditionally assigned to Mascagnia but now properly called Amorimia species and other Palicourea species are reported to cause sudden death in livestock and are suspected to contain MFA due to the similarity of clinical signs. In this study, an HPLC–APCI–MS method to detect and quantify MFA was developed and was used to investigate plant material from field collections and/or herbarium specimens of Mascagnia, Amorimia, and Palicourea species suspected of causing sudden death. MFA was detected in Amorimia amazonica, Amorimia camporum, Amorimia exotropica, Amorimia pubiflora, Amorimia rigida, and Amorimia septentrionalis as well as Palicourea aeneofusca. MFA concentrations differ greatly between Palicourea species and Amorimia species, which may explain the incidence of poisoning and the amount of plant material required to cause sudden death between these taxa.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPalicourea 3adeath 3aherbaria 3alivestock 3apoisoning 3aBrazil1 aCook, Daniel1 aRiet-Correa, Franklin1 aPfister, James A.1 aAnderson, William R.1 aLima, Flavia G.1 aGardner, Dale R.0 tToxicon.g2012 Oct., v. 60, no. 5 p.791-796dElsevier Ltdx0041-01017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.toxicon.2012.05.0293Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02025naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001900144245002500163300001600188520071500204592002800919650001800947650002300965650001800988650002701006650001801033650001401051650001101065650001001076650001501086650001401101650000901115650001901124650002901143650001401172651001201186653001401198653002101212653003001233653001401263700002001277700001901297700001601316773012301332856007901455852000901534655001201543IND60563032520221120170844.0170209e20160818xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056303252DNAL7 a10.1139/cjps-2016-01742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBing, Deng-Jin10aAAC Radius field pea  ap. 196-198.  aAAC Radius is a semi-leafless, green cotyledon field pea (Pisum sativum L.) cultivar developed at Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, Lacombe Research and Development Centre, Lacombe, Alberta, Canada.

A total of 20 pharmaceuticals in seawater and 14 in sediments were found at concentrations from low ngL−1 up to 168ngL−1 (azithromycin) in seawater and from low ngg−1 up to 50.3ngg−1 (xylazine) in sediments. Azithromycin, xylazine and metoprolol were the most ubiquitous compounds in seawater since they were found in all seawater samples collected. Seven compounds were quantified in both matrices: clarithromycin, erythromycin, hydrochlorothiazide, irbesartan, losartan, salicylic acid and valsartan. Seasonal distribution profiles revealed different sources of pollutants associated to both, El Albujón watercourse (which receives the input of a WWTP) and other non-controlled discharges, into the lagoon. In summer the highest concentrations in seawater for most of the pharmaceuticals were detected close to main touristic nuclei, probably as consequence of sources such as the excretion from bathers and/or other non-controlled discharges, these being significantly higher than in autumn and winter for antibiotics. On the contrary, the mean concentration of lorazepam was significantly higher in colder seasons than in warmer ones. Sulfamethoxazole, erythromycin and especially clarithromycin showed hazard quotients higher than 1 in seawater at some areas of this lagoon indicating a potential risk to aquatic organisms in such specific areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquatic organisms 3aautumn 3aazithromycin 3aclarithromycin 3acoastal water 3aexcretion 3ahydrochlorothiazide 3apollutants 3arisk 3asalicylic acid 3aseasonal variation 3aseawater 3asediments 3aspring 3asulfamethoxazole 3asummer 3awinter 3axylazine 3aSpain 0aPharmaceuticals 0aDistribution 0aSeasonality 0aCoastal lagoon 0aSeawater 0aSediment 0aEnvironmental risk1 aRodriguez-Mozaz, S.1 aGros, M.1 aBarceló, D.1 aLeón, V.M.0 tEnvironmental Research.g2015 Apr., v. 138 p.326-344dElsevier Inc.x0013-93517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2015.02.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02269naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002600140245011300166300001800279520108400297592002801381650002201409650002101431650002001452650001001472650001701482650000901499650001201508650002001520650004401540700001501584700001801599700001801617700001801635700001901653773012801672856007401800852000901874655001201883IND60657859720221116213403.0190816e20150903xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065785972DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ay00306g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTaudte, Regina Verena10aDevelopment of a UHPLC method for the detection of organic gunshot residues using artificial neural networks  ap. 7447-7454.  aThe introduction of lead and heavy-metal free ammunition to the market challenges the current protocol for gunshot residue (GSR) investigations, which focuses on the inorganic components. Future proofing GSR analysis requires the development and implementation of new methods for the collection and analysis of organic GSR (OGSR) into operational protocols. This paper describes the development and optimisation of an ultra high performance liquid chromatography method for the analysis of 32 compounds potentially present in OGSR. An artificial neural network was applied to predict the retention times of the target analytes for various gradients for rapid determination of optimum separation conditions. The final separation and analysis time for the 32 target analytes was 27 minutes with limits of detection ranging from 0.03 to 0.21 ng. The method was applied to the analysis of smokeless powder and samples collected from the hands of a shooter following the discharge of a firearm. The results demonstrate that the method has the potential for use in cases involving GSR.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical residues 3achemical species 3adetection limit 3ahands 3aheavy metals 3alead 3amarkets 3aneural networks 3aultra-performance liquid chromatography1 aRoux, Cl.,1 aBishop, David1 aBlanes, Lucas1 aDoble, Philip1 aBeavis, Alison0 tAnalytical methods.g2015 Sept. 3, v. 7, no. 18 p.7447-7454dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ay00306g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02772naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245011400168300001600282520133300298592002801631650001501659650002901674650002101703650001201724650002301736650000701759650001201766650001601778650001301794650001801807653002101825653003801846653002701884653001701911653001501928700001401943700001901957700001501976700001201991700001602003700001602019700001502035700001502050773011802065856008602183852000902269655001202278IND60585845120221120042932.0200503e20180115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058584512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2017.11.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTan, Wenbing10aIncreased suppression of methane production by humic substances in response to warming in anoxic environments  ap. 602-606.  aHumic substances (HS) are redox-active and can function as organic terminal electron acceptors in anaerobic microbial respiration, which plays a relevant role on suppressing the emissions of methane (CH₄) in anoxic systems. However, it is unclear whether or not there is an inherent link between suppression of CH₄ emissions by HS and warming temperature. In this study, we assess the effects of HS additions on CH₄ production in paddy and wetland soils and their responses to increasing temperature by incubation experiments. We show that the intensity of HS to suppress CH₄ production under anoxic condition is positively associated with the temperature, which may be due to the fact that the activities of enzymes involved in methanogenesis have lower temperature sensitivity than those involved in microbial HS reduction, and that the methanogenesis process is less susceptible to increasing temperature compared to the microbial HS reduction process. The hypothetical increase in the effectiveness of pH alteration and HS toxicity caused by warming may be also responsible for the increased inhibition of CH₄ production by HS addition in response to increasing temperature. Our findings highlight the increasingly important role of HS in suppressing CH₄ production in anoxic ecosystems in a future warmer world.  aPublisher supplied data 3aecosystems 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3ahumic substances 3amethane 3amethane production 3apH 3apaddies 3atemperature 3atoxicity 3awetland soils 0aHumic substances 0aSuppression of methane production 0aIncreasing temperature 0aWetland soil 0aPaddy soil1 aJia, Yufu1 aHuang, Caihong1 aZhang, Hui1 aLi, Dan1 aZhao, Xinyu1 aWang, Guoan1 aJiang, Jie1 aXi, Beidou0 tJournal of environmental management.g2018 Jan. 15, v. 206 p.602-606dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2017.11.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02120naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002400146245015700170300001300327520096900340592002801309650001701337650002601354651001301380651000901393653001201402653002001414653002601434653002801460653002901488653002601517700002001543773011801563856008001681852000901761655001201770IND60126969320221119224359.0150428e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012696932DNAL7 a10.2993/0278-0771-32.1.62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGilmore, Michael P.14aThe Use of Participatory Mapping in Ethnobiological Research, Biocultural Conservation, and Community Empowerment: A Case Study From the Peruvian Amazon  ap. 6-29.  aThis paper describes in detail a community-based participatory mapping project that was carried out in collaboration with the Maijuna of the Peruvian Amazon. We use this project as a case study to explore the role that participatory mapping can play in ethnobiological studies and to examine the rich and diverse range of data that this methodology can generate, ultimately shedding light on how indigenous and local communities use, perceive, and interact with their environment and resources. Additionally, participatory mapping can be a powerful tool for biocultural conservation and community empowerment. This is especially critical given that many ethnobiologists work with marginalized indigenous and local communities experiencing enormous sociocultural and environmental change and challenges. Given the great potential of this methodology we strongly feel that participatory mapping can and should play a more significant role in ethnobiological studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3acommunity development 3aAmazonia 3aPeru 0aMaijuna 0aPeruvian Amazon 0aparticipatory mapping 0aethnobiological methods 0abiocultural conservation 0acommunity empowerment1 aYoung, Jason C.0 tJournal of ethnobiology.g2012 July, v. 32, no. 1 p.6-29dSociety of EthnobiologywJournal:19742x2162-44967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2993/0278-0771-32.1.63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01351naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001800144245002700162300001600189520025200205592002800457650001300485650001300498650001900511650000900530650001700539653000900556653001000565653001600575653002500591700002400616700002200640700001400662700002500676700002300701700001800724773012300742856007900865852000900944655001200953IND60563032620221120180055.0170209e20160715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056303262DNAL7 a10.1139/cjps-2016-01762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReid, Lana M.10aCO462 corn inbred line  ap. 177-182.  aCO462 is a short season corn (Zea mays L.) inbred line with excellent combining ability with both Iodent and stiff stalk inbred testers as well as superior cold tolerance and intermediate resistance to common rust, eyespot, and fusarium stalk rot.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFusarium 3aZea mays 3acold tolerance 3acorn 3ainbred lines 0acorn 0amaize 0aZea mays L. 0acultivar description1 aVoloaca, Constantin1 aMorrison, Malcolm1 aWu, Jinhe1 aWoldemariam, Tsegaye1 aJindal, Krishan K.1 aZhu, Xiaoyang0 tCanadian journal of plant science.g2016 July 15, v. 97, no. 1 p.177-182dCanadian Science Publishingx1918-18337nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjps-2016-01763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02988naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006500150245015700215500002200372520164500394592002802039650002402067650002402091650001902115650002202134650002002156650001202176650001202188650002902200650002502229650001102254653001702265653003202282653001802314653002902332700001702361700002102378700002202399773008502421856005102506852000902557655001202566IND60795564620221121212104.0221004e20220929xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079556462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2022.09.1282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEl Ibrahimi, Mohammed1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2934-555010aEffects of the temperature range on the energy performance of mixed and unmixed digesters with submerged waste: An experimental and CFD simulation study  aPre-press version  aThis study evaluated the effects of temperature range and occurrence/non-occurrence of mixing on the thermal and energetic performance of a batch pilot-scale anaerobic digester with submerged waste (ADSW). This digester was operated under four configurations, namely unmixed mesophilic (UMAD), liquid recirculation-mixed mesophilic (LMAD), unmixed thermophilic (UTAD), and liquid recirculation-mixed thermophilic (LTAD). Anaerobic digestion (AD) experiments indicated that the mixed ADSW produces higher methane yields under the thermophilic temperature range (416.12 Nm3CH4/tVS) compared to the mesophilic range (362.23 Nm3CH4/tVS). However, when the ADSW is not mixed, lower methane yields are measured under the thermophilic range (184.82 Nm3CH4/tVS) compared to the mesophilic range (295.41 Nm3CH4/tVS). In an attempt to understand these opposing results, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations were conducted. Findings showed that while a completely uniform temperature is achieved within the digester when mixing is performed, a temperature stratification occurs under unmixed conditions. This stratification, which is more severe in the thermophilic range, may be the reason behind the reported AD experiments findings. The energy balance calculations indicate that the ADSW achieves its best energy efficiency ratio under UMAD (1.72), followed respectively by LMAD (0.83), LTAD (0.66), and UTAD (0.29). This study brought to light an effect that, to our knowledge, has not been previously investigated, which is the impact of the temperature range on the temperature distribution and energy performance of unmixed digesters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanaerobic digesters 3aanaerobic digestion 3aenergy balance 3aenergy efficiency 3afluid mechanics 3aliquids 3amethane 3arenewable energy sources 3atemperature profiles 3awastes 0aCFD analysis 0aLiquid recirculation mixing 0aMethane yield 0aTemperature distribution1 aKhay, Ismail1 aEl Maakoul, Anas1 aBakhouya, Mohamed0 tRenewable energy.g2022 Sept. 29, dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2022.09.128  aDNAL 7aarticle02939naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245013300168300001800301520124100319592002801560650004401588650002901632650002501661650001701686650003801703650002301741650001801764650002101782650004401803650003101847650002301878650002101901653003501922653001601957653001401973653003101987653001602018700001402034700002002048700001302068700002002081700001302101700001302114700001902127700001802146700001202164773013702176856008702313852000902400655001202409IND60676643720221122050217.0200210e20200215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067664372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2019.09.1922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiao, Luyao10aPreparation, characterization and antioxidant activities of derivatives of exopolysaccharide from Lactobacillus helveticus MB2-1  ap. 1008-1017.  aIn this study, different derivatives of exopolysaccharides (EPS-2) from Lactobacillus helveticus MB2-1 including acetylated EPS-2 (A-EPS-2), carboxymethyl EPS-2 (C-EPS-2), sulfated EPS-2 (S-EPS-2) and phosphorylated EPS-2 (P-EPS-2) were prepared. Furthermore, the structure, physicochemical properties and antioxidant activities of EPS-2 and its derivatives were compared. The introduction of different chemical groups was confirmed using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance spectrogram, and the degrees of substitution (DS) for A-EPS-2, C-EPS-2, S-EPS-2 and P-EPS-2 were 0.439, 0.526, 0.625 and 0.432, respectively. Among four derivatives, the particle size distribution of A-EPS-2, C-EPS-2 and P-EPS-2 was in accordance with the molecular weight (Mw) distribution. Besides, the results of scanning electron micrograph, thermogravimetric analysis and differential scanning calorimetry indicated the surface morphology and thermal behavior of EPS-2 had greatly changed after modification. Notably, several derivatives especially S-EPS-2 exhibited improved antioxidant activities when compared with EPS-2, implying the derivatives of EPS-2 might have wide applications as antioxidants in food industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aLactobacillus helveticus 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3aexopolysaccharides 3afood industry 3amolecular weight 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aparticle size distribution 3athermal properties 3athermogravimetry 0aLactobacillus helveticus MB2-1 0aDerivatives 0aStructure 0aPhysicochemical properties 0aAntioxidant1 aHan, Shuo1 aZhou, Jianzhong1 aXu, Qian1 aDong, Mingsheng1 aFan, Xia1 aRui, Xin1 aChen, Xiaohong1 aZhang, Qiuqin1 aLi, Wei0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2020 Feb. 15, v. 145 p.1008-1017dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2019.09.1923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02644naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002200188245009200210300001200302506007600314520117200390592002801562596004501590506003701635650001701672650002701689650000901716650001301725650002301738650002101761650001101782650001101793650001101804650001601815650001101831650001201842650001801854651000901872700006301881773015101944856008202095852000902177655001202186IND60594652920221207105139.0180904e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059465292DNAL7 a10.1007/s10661-018-6716-12doi7 aPMC59458032pmcid7 a297487232pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCook, Danielle R.10aAssociations between riffle development and aquatic biota following lowhead dam removal  ap. 339.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aDam removal is an increasingly common river restoration option, yet some of the mechanisms leading to ecological changes remain unquantified. We assessed relationships between riffle structure and benthic macroinvertebrate and fish assemblages 2 years after a lowhead dam removal in Ohio, USA. Hydrogeomorphic, water-chemistry, and biotic surveys were conducted at seven study riffles at six time intervals from spring 2014 through summer 2015. The density and diversity of macroinvertebrates and fish were significantly different over time, largely as a function of season (lowest densities in early spring, greatest in summer). Macroinvertebrate, but not fish, assemblage composition was different by time but not riffle. Although hydrogeomorphic characteristics (e.g., streamflow velocity, substrate size) were linked to shifts in macroinvertebrates and fish, chemical water-quality parameters (e.g., dissolved oxygen, nutrient concentrations) were also implicated as potential biotic drivers. Our results indicate that riffle habitat development can be an important mechanism related to restoring sensitive species and biological diversity following dam removal.  aPublisher supplied data  aDEB-1341215cNational Science Foundation0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abiodiversity 3aecological restoration 3afish 3ahabitats 3amacroinvertebrates 3anutrient content 3aoxygen 3arivers 3aspring 3astream flow 3asummer 3asurveys 3awater quality 3aOhio1 aSullivan, Mažeika,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2341-53160 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2018 June, v. 190, no. 6 p.339-339dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl33242x0167-63697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-018-6716-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02926naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002000189245013400209300001400343520162500357592002801982653003102010653003302041653002702074653000902101653002102110653001502131653001402146700001802160700001802178700002002196700001802216700001702234700001702251700002702268700001802295773010002313856008202413852000902495655001202504IND60573096620221118123321.0170720e20170915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057309662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.omtn.2017.05.0122doi7 aPMC54770682pmcid7 a289180272pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPark, Tae Kwann10aAdeno-Associated Viral Vector-Mediated mTOR Inhibition by Short Hairpin RNA Suppresses Laser-Induced Choroidal Neovascularization  ap. 26-35.  aChoroidal neovascularization (CNV) is the defining characteristic feature of the wet subtype of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and may result in irreversible blindness. Based on anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF), the current therapeutic approaches to CNV are fraught with difficulties, and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) has recently been proposed as a possible therapeutic target, although few studies have been conducted. Here, we show that a recombinant adeno-associated virus-delivered mTOR-inhibiting short hairpin RNA (rAAV-mTOR shRNA), which blocks the activity of both mTOR complex 1 and 2, represents a promising therapeutic approach for the treatment of CNV. Eight-week-old male C57/B6 mice were treated with the short hairpin RNA (shRNA) after generating CNV lesions in the eyes via laser photocoagulation. The recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) delivery vehicle was able to effectively transduce cells in the inner retina, and significantly fewer inflammatory cells and less extensive CNV were observed in the animals treated with rAAV-mTOR shRNA when compared with control- and rAAV-scrambled shRNA-treated groups. Presumably related to the reduction of CNV, increased autophagy was detected in CNV lesions treated with rAAV-mTOR shRNA, whereas significantly fewer apoptotic cells detected in the outer nuclear layer around the CNV indicate that mTOR inhibition may also have neuroprotective effects. Taken together, these results demonstrate the therapeutic potential of mTOR inhibition, resulting from rAAV-mTOR shRNA activity, in the treatment of AMD-related CNV.  aPublisher supplied data 0aretinal neovascularization 0achoroidal neovascularization 0aadeno-associated virus 0amTOR 0aRNA interference 0amTOR shRNA 0aautophagy1 aLee, Si Hyung1 aChoi, Jun Sub1 aNah, Seung Kwan1 aKim, Hee Jong1 aPark, Ha Yan1 aLee, Heuiran1 aLee, Steven Hyun Seung1 aPark, Keerang0 tMolecular Therapy - Nucleic Acids.g2017 Sept. 15, v. 8 p.26-35dElsevier Inc.x2162-25317nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.omtn.2017.05.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02835naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245009800169300001800267520136300285592002801648650003201676650000801708650002001716650001501736650001601751650001001767650002201777650001201799650001401811650001201825650000901837650001301846650001401859653003201873653001501905653001801920653001101938700002001949700001501969700001901984700001802003700001602021700001902037700002002056700001802076700001702094773009902111856008602210852000902296655001202305IND60531918720221118200401.0190319e20160412xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053191872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2016.02.0622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLim, Seong-In10aSafety of classical swine fever virus vaccine strain LOM in pregnant sows and their offspring  ap. 2021-2026.  aThe present study aimed to evaluate the safety of the classical swine fever virus (CSFV) vaccine strain LOM in pregnant sows. Pregnant sows with free CSFV antibody were inoculated with a commercial LOM vaccine during early pregnancy (day 38; n=3) or mid-pregnancy (days 49–59; n=11). In pregnant sows vaccinated during the early stages of gestation, abortion (day 109) was observed in one case, with two stillbirths and seven mummified fetuses. The viability of live-born piglets was 34.9% in sows vaccinated during mid-pregnancy compared with 81.8% in the control group. Post-mortem examination of the organs of the sows and piglets did not reveal any pathological lesions caused by CSFV; however, CSFV RNA was detected in the organs of several vaccinated sows and their litters. The LOM strain was transmitted from sows with free CSFV antibody to their fetus, but did not appear to induce immune tolerance in the offspring from vaccinated pregnant sows. Side effects were not observed in pregnant sows with antibody to the LOM strain: transmission from sow to their litters and stillbirth or mummified fetuses. The LOM strain may induce sterile immunity and provide rapid, long-lasting, and complete protection against CSFV; however, it should be contraindicated in pregnant sows due to potential adverse effects in pregnant sows with free CSFV antibody.  aPublisher supplied data 3aClassical swine fever virus 3aRNA 3aadverse effects 3aantibodies 3afetal death 3afetus 3aimmunosuppression 3apiglets 3apregnancy 3aprogeny 3asows 3avaccines 3aviability 0aClassical swine fever virus 0aLOM strain 0aPregnant sows 0aSafety1 aSong, Jae-Young1 aKim, Jaejo1 aHyun, Bang-Hun1 aKim, Ha-Young1 aCho, In-Soo1 aKim, Byounghan1 aWoo, Gye-Hyeong1 aLee, Jung-Bok1 aAn, Dong-Jun0 tVaccine.g2016 Apr. 12, v. 34, no. 17 p.2021-2026dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2016.02.0623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03011naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245013000172300001600302520135500318592002801673650001301701650002801714650001601742650001601758650002401774650001801798650001801816650002301834650001001857650002001867650001801887650001001905650001201915650001901927650001201946650001101958650001601969650002201985650002302007650002102030650001302051650001402064650001402078653001402092653001802106653001302124653002502137653002602162700002602188773013502214856008702349852000902436655001202445IND60676643820221122050249.0220328e20200615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067664382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2019.10.2252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSharma, Bharati10aModifying the dough mixing behavior, protein & starch digestibility and antinutritional profile of minor millets by sprouting  ap. 962-970.  aThe objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of sprouting (0, 12, 24, 36, 48 hr) on enzyme activity, protein solubility, dough mixing behavior, anti-nutritional components and in vitro starch and protein digestibility of minor millets. Sprouting decreased starch, fat, protein and ash contents while the dietary fiber content, amylase and protease activity significantly (p < 0.05) increased. Sprouting promoted a significant (p < 0.05) decrease in anti-nutritonal components like phytic acid and condensed tannin. The protein solubility enhanced that also resulted in improved protein digestibility (in vitro) of sprouted millets. Sprouting exerted a significant (p < 0.05) effect on mixolab dough rheology indicating a decrease in dough consistency (C1), peak and final viscosity whilst protein weakening and breakdown increased (p < 0.05). This process produced an increase in free glucose thereby improving rapidly digestible starch and increasing glycemic index. A significant (p < 0.05) reduction in resistant starch along with slowly digestible starch was promoted during sprouting. In conclusion, sprouting provides millet flours with modified nutritional quality and better technofunctional properties than the raw flours that may suggest their potential utilization in complementary food formulations and baked products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamylases 3aantinutritional factors 3aash content 3abaked goods 3acomplementary foods 3adietary fiber 3adigestibility 3adigestible protein 3adough 3aenzyme activity 3afiber content 3aflour 3aglucose 3aglycemic index 3amillets 3amixing 3aphytic acid 3aproanthocyanidins 3aprotein solubility 3aresistant starch 3arheology 3asprouting 3aviscosity 0aSprouting 0aMinor millets 0aRheology 0aStarch digestibility 0aProtein digestibility1 aGujral, Hardeep Singh0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2020 June 15, v. 153 p.962-970dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2019.10.2253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01432naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245006700168300001400235520053800249592002800787653002700815653004600842653001900888653002900907700001400936773011100950856008401061852000901145655001201154IND60573096720221118123347.0170720e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057309672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.suscom.2017.05.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKrishna, C.M.10aThermal-aware management techniques for cyber-physical systems  ap. 39-51.  aThe power density of processors has increased greatly over time.

Such systems are constrained by the need to meet hard deadlines; this distinguishes them from general-purpose systems and motivates distinctive resource-management approaches.  aPublisher supplied data 0aCyber-physical systems 0aProactive and reactive thermal management 0aTask deadlines 0aThermal age acceleration1 aKoren, I.0 tSustainable Computing: Informatics and Systems.g2017 Sept., v. 15 p.39-51dElsevier Inc.x2210-53797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.suscom.2017.05.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03489naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245009700170300001600267520202500283592002802308650003002336650001402366650001102380650001702391650001502408650001802423650001902441650002802460650000902488650002702497650001302524653001102537653001902548653001802567653002402585653002202609653002002631700002002651700001802671700002302689700002102712700002002733700002702753700002102780773008902801856008402890852000902974655001202983IND60544861320221117223841.0160901e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054486132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2015.02.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnjum, Naser A.10aNanoscale copper in the soil–plant system – toxicity and underlying potential mechanisms  ap. 306-325.  aNanoscale copper particles (nano-Cu) are used in many antimicrobial formulations and products for their antimicrobial activity. They may enter deliberately and/or accidentally into terrestrial environments including soils. Being the major ‘eco-receptors’ of nanoscale particles in the terrestrial ecosystem, soil–microbiota and plants (the soil–plant system) have been used as a model to dissect the potential impact of these particles on the environmental and human health. In the soil–plant system, the plant can be an indirect non-target organism of the soil-associated nano-Cu that may in turn affect plant-based products and their consumers. By all accounts, information pertaining to nano-Cu toxicity and the underlying potential mechanisms in the soil–plant system remains scanty, deficient and little discussed. Therefore, based on some recent reports from (bio)chemical, molecular and genetic studies of nano-Cu versus soil–plant system, this article: (i) overviews the status, chemistry and toxicity of nano-Cu in soil and plants, (ii) discusses critically the poorly understood potential mechanisms of nano-Cu toxicity and tolerance both in soil–microbiota and plants, and (iii) proposes future research directions. It appears from studies hitherto made that the uncontrolled generation and inefficient metabolism of reactive oxygen species through different reactions are the major factors underpinning the overall nano-Cu consequences in both the systems. However, it is not clear whether the nano-Cu or the ion released from it is the cause of the toxicity. We advocate to intensify the multi-approach studies focused at a complete characterization of the nano-Cu, its toxicity (during life cycles of the least-explored soil–microbiota and plants), and behavior in an environmentally relevant terrestrial exposure setting. Such studies may help to obtain a deeper insight into nano-Cu actions and address adequately the nano-Cu-associated safety concerns in the ‘soil–plant system’.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanti-infective properties 3achemistry 3acopper 3ahuman health 3ametabolism 3ananoparticles 3aplant products 3areactive oxygen species 3asoil 3aterrestrial ecosystems 3atoxicity 0aCopper 0aMetal toxicity 0aNanoparticles 0aSoil–plant system 0aSoil–microbiota 0aPlant tolerance1 aAdam, Vojtěch,1 aKizek, René,1 aDuarte, Armando C.1 aPereira, Eduarda1 aIqbal, Muhammad1 aLukatkin, Alexander S.1 aAḥmad, Iqbāl,0 tEnvironmental Research.g2015 Apr., v. 138 p.306-325dElsevier Inc.x0013-93517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2015.02.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03521naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245011200170300001800282520178900300592002802089650001802117650002202135650001402157650002502171650001502196650001602211650001802227650003302245650001102278650002002289650001902309650001702328650001902345650001802364650002802382650001202410650002202422650001602444650001602460650003302476650002502509650001202534653000802546653001202554653001502566653003902581653002902620653003502649700001702684700001802701700001802719773009902737856008602836852000902922655001202931IND60619606620221119145657.0190401e20181029xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061960662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2018.09.0622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalmons, Brian10aNon-clinical safety assessment of repeated intramuscular administration of an EV-A71 VLP vaccine in rabbits  ap. 6623-6630.  aA candidate hand, foot, and mouth disease vaccine comprising of human enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) virus-like particles (VLPs) was tested in rabbits to evaluate the potential local and systemic effects of this vaccine. The rabbits received more than double the full human dose and one additional dose according to the n + 1 recommended scheme. The three doses were given mixed with Alhydrogel adjuvant as intramuscular (IM) injections. Vaccinations were well-tolerated, with no indication of overt toxicity in any parameter observed. An EV-A71 specific immune response in the form of antibodies that specifically reacted with the virus capsid proteins VP1 and VP0, the complete VLP, and EV-A71 viruses of different subgenotypes to that of the vaccine could be demonstrated. A boosting effect in the form of higher EV-A71 specific antibody titers was observed after the subsequent doses, and these enhanced titers were shown to be statistically significant in one-way ANOVA analyses. Fortnightly intramuscular administration of EV-A71 VLP vaccine did not result in any test article-related changes in immunotoxicity as defined by increased serum IL-6, and in general IL-6 concentrations remained below the lower limit of quantitation for the majority of animals throughout the study. Although increased indicators of inflammation at the injection site were observed in animals sacrificed immediately after the last vaccination, these largely reversed at the end of the recovery phase. No findings suggestive of systemic or delayed toxicity were recorded in this independently conducted study. In conclusion, repeated IM administration of the EV-A71 VLP vaccine were locally and systemically well-tolerated in rabbits and immunogenic, supporting the clinical development of the vaccine.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEnterovirus A 3aHuman enterovirus 3aadjuvants 3aanalysis of variance 3aantibodies 3ablood serum 3acoat proteins 3ahand, foot and mouth disease 3ahumans 3aimmune response 3aimmunotoxicity 3ainflammation 3ainjection site 3ainterleukin-6 3aintramuscular injection 3arabbits 3asafety assessment 3asubgenotype 3avaccination 3avirus-like particle vaccines 3avirus-like particles 3aviruses 0aVLP 0aVaccine 0aToxicology 0aHand foot and mouth disease (HFMD) 0aEnterovirus A71 (EV-A71) 0aNon-clinical safety assessment1 aLim, Pei-Yin1 aDjurup, René1 aCardosa, Jane0 tVaccine.g2018 Oct. 29, v. 36, no. 45 p.6623-6630dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2018.09.0623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01898naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245016600163300001600329520071800345592002801063650002201091650001201113650001401125650001201139651001401151653002201165653002201187653002101209653002001230653002301250700002501273700002501298773012201323856008201445852000901527655001201536IND60126969620221119224040.0150428e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012696962DNAL7 a10.2993/0278-0771-32.2.1572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEllen, Roy14aThe Biocultural History of Manihot esculenta In the Moluccan Islands Of Eastern Indonesia: Assessing Evidence for the Movement and Selection of Cassava Germplasm  ap. 157-184.  aThis paper examines the circulation of cassava germplasm (Manihot esculenta) as a problem in biocultural history.

Using a combination of lexical, ethnographic, botanical and genetic data, including material from ecologically-contrasting field sites, it evaluates the evidence for tracking germplasm movement at the local and regional level, considers the extent to which this contributes to local agrobiological diversity, and reflects upon some methodological problems of integrating sociocultural and scientific evidence.  aPublisher supplied data 3aManihot esculenta 3acassava 3agermplasm 3aislands 3aIndonesia 0aManihot esculenta 0aeastern Indonesia 0aagrobiodiversity 0alocal knowledge 0agermplasm exchange1 aSoselisa, Hermien L.1 aWulandari, Asri Peni0 tJournal of ethnobiology.g2012 Sept., v. 32, no. 2 p.157-184dSociety of EthnobiologywJournal:19742x2162-44967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2993/0278-0771-32.2.1573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03475naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005800150245012300208500002200331520210400353592002802457650001102485650001102496650001602507650001402523650002902537650001902566650002802585650002802613653003602641653001002677653000902687653003002696653002202726700002102748700002602769700005602795700005702851773008502908856005102993852000903044655001203053IND60795564920221121234234.0221004e20220929xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079556492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2022.09.1322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThanh, Hung Vo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7094-938010aApplication of hybrid artificial intelligent models to predict deliverability of underground natural gas storage sites  aPre-press version  aUnderground natural gas storage is a promising solution to lowering greenhouse gas emissions and attaining sustainable development goals. However, several issues prevent the application of storage projects on a global scale. An accurate estimation of the delivered amount of natural gas from each storage site might be used for supply and demand. Due to this fact, this study proposed hybrid intelligent models integrating the least square support vector machine (LSSVM), differential evolution (DE), imperialist competitive algorithm (ICA), cultural algorithm (CA), teaching learning-based optimization (TLBO), genetic algorithm (GA), and particle swarm optimization (PSO) for approximating the deliverability of underground natural gas storage in different geological formations. We have employed vast data sets of 782 reservoirs from depleted fields to train and validate the proposed intelligent models to predict underground natural gas storage deliverability in the USA. The visual and analytical assessments were used to investigate the performance of the developed intelligent systems. The predicted results showed that all of the intelligent models agreed with the recorded data. Moreover, the statistical indicators revealed that the LSSVM coupling TLBO model shows the highest accuracy in predicting the deliverability of natural gas storage in the depleted field among three intelligent models. Also, the optimal intelligent model accurately predicts 880 and 600 data measurements of saline aquifers and salt domes, respectively. The optimal intelligent model yields a root mean square error (RMSE) value of less than 0.022. The correlation factor (R²) is over 0.998, 0.999, and 0.906 for the depleted field, saline aquifers, and salt domes, respectively. The results highlight the importance of combining smart approaches with nature-inspired strategies in forecasting storage site deliverability. In light of these findings, researchers are better equipped to reduce petroleum energy usage and increase community acceptability of natural gas as part of the transition to green energy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy 3amodels 3anatural gas 3apetroleum 3arenewable energy sources 3asupply balance 3asupport vector machines 3asustainable development 0aUnderground natural gas storage 0aLSSVM 0aTLBO 0aHybrid intelligent models 0aEnergy transition1 aZamanyad, Aiyoub1 aSafaei-Farouji, Majid1 aAshraf, Umar1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2402-36051 aHemeng, Zhang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8378-20330 tRenewable energy.g2022 Sept. 29, dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2022.09.132  aDNAL 7aarticle02394naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002700151245008300178300001800261520107200279592002801351650001401379650002101393650003001414650001101444650002101455650002001476650001201496650001801508650001101526650001401537650001301551650002401564653002301588653001301611653001101624653002601635700002201661700002201683700001801705700001901723773009901742856008601841852000901927655001201936IND60531918920221118200403.0190319e20160419xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053191892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2016.02.0642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Michelle Sue Jann10aCurrent status of synthetic hemozoin adjuvant: A preliminary safety evaluation  ap. 2055-2061.  aAlthough adjuvants are a “must-have” component of successful vaccines, there are very few adjuvants licensed for use in humans, there is therefore an urgent need to develop new and safer adjuvants. Synthetic hemozoin (sHZ), a chemical analog of hemozoin which is produced by the malaria parasite, exhibits a potent adjuvant effect which enhances antigen-specific immune responses to vaccines. The potency of sHZ adjuvanticity is not limited to malaria specific vaccines, it has also been demonstrated to be effective in influenza and dog allergy models. While the synthesis of uniformly sized sHZ with consistent characteristics has proven difficult, we have recently successfully optimized the manufacture of sHZ product with an optimal adjuvant effect. Here, we summarize recent developments on the adjuvant properties of optimized sHZ adjuvant, including its good laboratory practice (GLP) non-clinical safety profile in animals. These studies ensure the safety of optimized sHZ product to be readily used as vaccine adjuvant beforehand in veterinary medicine.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadjuvants 3acanine influenza 3agood laboratory practices 3ahumans 3ahypersensitivity 3aimmune response 3amalaria 3amanufacturing 3amodels 3aparasites 3avaccines 3aveterinary medicine 0aSynthetic hemozoin 0aAdjuvant 0aSafety 0aNon-clinical toxicity1 aIgari, Yoshikatsu1 aTsukui, Toshihiro1 aIshii, Ken J.1 aCoban, Cevayir0 tVaccine.g2016 Apr. 19, v. 34, no. 18 p.2055-2061dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2016.02.0643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04056naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245009300170300001600263520267300279592002802952650002502980650001003005650001103015650000903026650001703035650001103052651001103063651001203074651001203086651001603098651001303114651001103127651001803138653001903156653001203175653001303187653001103200653001503211700002203226700001803248700001903266700001903285700001703304700001603321700001903337773008903356856008403445852000903529655001203538IND60544861420221117223950.0160901e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054486142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2015.02.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aClark, C.

The average total lead concentration of the enamel decorative paints purchased in Lebanon, Paraguay and Russia was 24,500ppm (ppm, dry weight), more than 270 times the current limit of 90ppm in Canada and in the United States. Sixty-three percent of these paints contained concentrations greater than 90ppm. Fifty-nine percent contained concentrations greater than 600ppm, the current limit in some countries. The maximum concentrations found were 236,000ppm in Lebanon, 169,000ppm in Paraguay and 52,900ppm in Russia. An average of 29% of the samples contained exceedingly high lead concentrations, >=10,000ppm.Five brands of paint were sampled in each of Lebanon and Paraguay and seven in Russia. Three colors from each brand were analyzed. For five of the six samples of the two brands in Lebanon with affiliations outside the country, the lead concentrations ranged from 1360ppm to 135,000ppm. In Lebanon the maximum concentration in the Egypt-affiliated brand (Sipes) was 135,000ppm and the maximum for the USA-affiliated brand (Dutch Boy) was 32,400ppm. Lead was not detected in any paints from the three of the four brands of paint purchased in Paraguay that had headquarters/affiliations in other countries (Brazil-Coralit), Germany (Suvinil) and USA (Novacor)). Two of the three paints from each of the other Paraguay brands contained high levels of lead with the maximum concentrations of 108,000 and 168,000ppm; one of these brands was manufactured under a license from ICI in the Netherlands. All of the paints purchased in Russia were from Russian brands and were manufactured in Russia. All three paints from one brand contained below detection levels of lead. The maximum levels of lead in the other six brands in Russia ranged from 3230 to 52,900ppm. The two brands with the highest lead concentration, TEKS and LAKRA, were produced by companies in the top three in market share.. Overall, lead concentrations were much higher in the colored paints such as red and yellow than in white paints. In each of the three countries a brand based in that country had a colored paint that either met a 90ppm limit or was close to meeting the limit-demonstrating that practical technology was available in each of these countries to produce low lead bright colored enamel decorative paints. Even though technology for producing paint without added lead existed in each of these countries, twenty-nine (29) percent of the paints analyzed contained exceedingly high concentrations (>=10,000ppm) of lead.  aPublisher supplied data 3abusiness enterprises 3acolor 3aenamel 3alead 3amarket share 3apaints 3aCanada 3aGermany 3aLebanon 3aNetherlands 3aParaguay 3aRussia 3aUnited States 0aNew paint lead 0aLebanon 0aParaguay 0aRussia 0alead paint1 aSperanskaya, Olga1 aBrosche, Sara1 aGonzalez, Hebe1 aSolis, Daniela1 aKodeih, Naji1 aRoda, Sandy1 aLind, Caroline0 tEnvironmental Research.g2015 Apr., v. 138 p.432-438dElsevier Inc.x0013-93517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2015.02.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02745naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117072000900135072000900144072000900153100002000162245011300182300001800295500002400313500001500337520145800352650001301810650002301823650002301846650002501869650001901894650001701913650002301930653002001953653001701973700002301990700002002013773012302033852000902156856007502165930003302240945002502273946001302298655001202311IND4445885820221123035852.0101130e201011  xx |||||o|||||||||||rus||7 aIND444588582DNAL7 a10.1603/ME101162doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL821 0aL810 0aL0011 aAmelotti, Ivana14aThe Effects of Cypermethrin Pour-On and Piperonyl Butoxide on Triatoma infestans Under Laboratory Conditions  ap. 1135-1140.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe effect of exposing Triatoma infestans to chickens treated with Cypermethrin pour-on combined with piperonyl butoxide (PBO) was studied. Four groups of treated chickens and one control group were used. Each treatment received 1 or 2 ml of the Cypermethrin formulation with and without PBO. Independent groups of nymphs were fed 1, 7, 15, 30, and 45 d after the treatment application. Blood intake was estimated after each feeding occasion. Up to 15 d after the pour-on application, high mortality was observed in all nymphs fed on treated chickens (>93%±12), and lower than the nymphs of the control group (<33%±15). After 30 d of the pour-on application, there was significantly different mortality between the treatment with 1 ml (80%±9) and 2 ml (>96%±5); no difference was observed between groups with or without PBO addition. After 45 d of the pour-on application, the treatments did not show significant differences (77%±7), although all treatments showed higher mortality than the control group (10%±9). Up to 45 d after the pour-on application, blood intake by nymphs exposed to treated chickens (0.85±0.96 mg/nymph) was lower than blood intake by nymphs exposed to control chickens (6.7±5 mg/nymph). This study shows that Cypermethrin pour-on produces high mortality and reduces the blood intake of third-instar nymphs of T. infestans up to 45 d after the insecticide application to chickens. PBO did not produce a detectable effect. 3achickens 3apiperonyl butoxide 3adisease prevention 3apour-on formulations 3ainsect vectors 3acypermethrin 3aTriatoma infestans 0adisease control 0ablood intake1 aCatalá, Silvia S.1 aGorla, David E.0 tJournal of medical entomology.g2010 Nov., v. 47, no. 6 p.1135-1140dEntomological Society of Americax0022-25857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603/ME101163Available from publisher's Web site  a20110205b20110305c00000000  aINDd6CTe2010/12/20  aOther US 7aarticle02726naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006600151245012900217500002200346520136200368592002801730650001701758650002201775650001801797650000901815650001501824650002901839650001501868651001101883653001501894653001501909653001901924653002101943653001301964653001501977700002301992700001802015700002802033700002402061700002102085773008002106856008502186852000902271655001202280IND60585845520221123042946.0171114s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058584552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2017.11.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHaghighatafshar, Salar1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8640-276910aEfficiency of blue-green stormwater retrofits for flood mitigation – Conclusions drawn from a case study in Malmö, Sweden  aPre-press version  aCoupled one-dimensional (1D) sewer and two-dimensional (2D) overland flow hydrodynamic models were constructed to evaluate the flood mitigation efficiency of a renowned blue-green stormwater retrofit, i.e. Augustenborg, in Malmö, Sweden. Simulation results showed that the blue-green stormwater systems were effective in controlling local surface flooding in inner-city catchments, having reduced the total flooded surfaces by about 70%. However, basement flooding could still be a potential problem depending on the magnitude of the inflows through combined sewer from upstream areas. Moreover, interactions between blue-green retrofits and the surrounding pipe-system were studied. It was observed that the blue-green retrofits reduced the peak flows by approximately 80% and levelled out the runoff. This is a substantial advantage for downstream pipe-bound catchments, as they do not receive a cloudburst-equivalent runoff from the retrofitted catchment, but a reduced flow corresponding to a much milder rainfall. Blue-green retrofits are more effective if primarily implemented in the upstream areas of a pipe-bound catchment since the resulting reduced runoff and levelled out discharge would benefit the entire network lying downstream. Implementing blue-green retrofits from upstream towards downstream can be considered as a sustainable approach.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3ahydrologic models 3aoverland flow 3arain 3astormwater 3astormwater sewer systems 3awatersheds 3aSweden 0aBlue-green 0aCloudburst 0aUrban drainage 0aFlood mitigation 0aRetrofit 0aStormwater1 aNordlöf, Beatrice1 aRoldin, Maria1 aGustafsson, Lars-Göran1 ala Cour Jansen, Jes1 aJönsson, Karin,0 tJournal of environmental management.g2017, dElsevier Ltdx0301-47977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2017.11.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03590naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006600151245009900217300001800316520213500334592002802469650002702497650001402524650001302538650001402551650002002565650001202585650001702597650002402614650001102638650001302649650001802662650002202680650001602702650001302718653001702731653001702748653002802765653002202793653002902815653002702844700002302871700002002894773009902914856008603013852000903099655001203108IND60619606920221119145248.0190401e20181126xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061960692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2018.10.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKarthigesu, Shantha P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3100-525310aDo grandparents influence parents’ decision to vaccinate their children? A systematic review  ap. 7456-7462.  aThe global reduction in childhood infectious diseases since the 1960s is primarily due to the success of extensive worldwide immunisation campaigns. However, the universal vaccination coverage program appears to have lost momentum in the wake of negative, unfounded claims about the safety of vaccines. While parents of the 21st century have little first-hand knowledge of devastating childhood diseases, grandparents are more likely to remember family and community members who were afflicted. In the current age of vaccine hesitancy and science scepticism, where research-informed arguments are not always persuasive, grandparents, through their experience of the diseases, may positively influence paediatric vaccine uptake. This paper reviews the literature investigating potential direct or indirect influences of grandparents on parents’ decisions to vaccinate their children. A database search using the keywords immunisation, vaccination, children and grandparents resulted in 1988 articles. Titles were screened for relevance and seventy-seven results were retained. After the abstracts were read, only five articles that either explored paediatric vaccines, factors promoting and/or inhibiting paediatric vaccine use and decision-making strategies were reviewed. One paper located through Google Scholar, which failed to show up on database searches, was also retained for a total of six papers. While none of the six papers set out to explore the impact of grandparents on vaccine uptake, they found that grandparents were involved to varying degrees in paediatric vaccine uptake within young families. The research clearly showing that grandparents, and older people more generally, promote vaccination uptake is not currently available. The dearth of literature shows the need for research exploring the perceived and real influences of grandparents on childhood vaccination. This will establish whether grandparents’ memory and knowledge of preventable childhood infectious diseases could be harnessed as a public health measure to counteract the current, ill-informed, negative attention on paediatric vaccines.  aPublisher supplied data 3aattitudes and opinions 3achildhood 3achildren 3adatabases 3adecision making 3aelderly 3agrandparents 3ainfectious diseases 3amemory 3amomentum 3apublic health 3asystematic review 3avaccination 3avaccines 0aGrandparents 0aChild health 0aPaediatric vaccinations 0aVaccine hesitancy 0aParental decision making 0aChildhood vaccinations1 aChisholm, James S.1 aCoall, David A.0 tVaccine.g2018 Nov. 26, v. 36, no. 49 p.7456-7462dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2018.10.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02334naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245012900157300001800286520113700304592002801441650004401469650001501513650001501528650001301543650001601556650001401572650001101586650001801597650001501615650002201630650001601652700001701668700001301685700001301698700001501711773012701726856007401853852000901927655001201936IND60657860220221116205414.0190816e20150709xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065786022DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ay00441a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Yifang10aCorrelation coefficient optimization in partial least-squares regression with application to ATR-FTIR spectroscopic analysis  ap. 5780-5786.  aA wavelength selection method for spectroscopic analysis, named correlation coefficient optimization coupled with partial least-squares (CCO-PLS), is proposed, and was successfully employed for reagent-free ATR-FTIR spectroscopic analysis of albumin (ALB) and globulin (GLB) in human serum. By varying the upper bound of correlation coefficient between absorbance and analyte's content, the CCO-PLS method achieved multi-band selection. Two PLS-based methods, which used a waveband having positive peaks of the first loading vector (FLV) and a combination of positive peaks of the correlation coefficient spectrum, were also conducted for comparison. Based on the leave-one-out cross-validation for CCO-PLS, appropriate waveband combinations for ALB and GLB were selected, the root-mean-square errors of prediction for validation samples were 1.36 and 1.35 (g L⁻¹) for ALB and GLB, respectively, which were better than the two comparison methods. The CCO-PLS method provided a new approach for multi-band selection to achieve high analytical accuracy for molecular absorption bands that were composed of several spaced wavebands.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aabsorbance 3aabsorption 3aalbumins 3ablood serum 3aglobulins 3ahumans 3aleast squares 3aprediction 3aspectral analysis 3awavelengths1 aChen, Jiemei1 aPan, Tao1 aHan, Yun1 aYao, Lijun0 tAnalytical methods.g2015 July 9, v. 7, no. 14 p.5780-5786dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ay00441a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02693naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005500151245006700206500002200273520164600295592002801941650001101969650002001980650001602000653001602016653002002032653002202052653002102074700005502095700001602150700001502166773008002181856008502261852000902346655001202355IND60585845620221123042837.0171114s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058584562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2017.11.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmith, H.M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4134-765210aPublic responses to water reuse – understanding the evidence  aPre-press version  aOver the years, much research has attempted to unpack what drives public responses to water reuse, using a variety of approaches. A large amount of this work was captured by an initial review that covered research undertaken up to the early 2000s (Hartley, 2006). This paper showcases post-millennium evidence and thinking around public responses to water reuse, and highlights the novel insights and shifts in emphasis that have occurred in the field. Our analysis is structured around four broad, and highly interrelated, strands of thinking: 1) work focused on identifying the range of factors that influence public reactions to the concept of water reuse, and broadly looking for associations between different factors; 2) more specific approaches rooted in the socio-psychological modelling techniques; 3) work with a particular focus on understanding the influences of trust, risk perceptions and affective (emotional) reactions; and 4) work utilising social constructivist perspectives and socio-technical systems theory to frame responses to water reuse. Some of the most significant advancements in thinking in this field stem from the increasingly sophisticated understanding of the ‘yuck factor’ and the role of such pre-cognitive affective reactions. These are deeply entrenched within individuals, but are also linked with wider societal processes and social representations. Work in this area suggests that responses to reuse are situated within an overall process of technological ‘legitimation’. These emerging insights should help stimulate some novel thinking around approaches to public engagement for water reuse.  aPublisher supplied data 3amodels 3arisk perception 3awater reuse 0aWater reuse 0aWater recycling 0aPublic engagement 0aPublic attitudes1 aBrouwer, S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1441-29301 aJeffrey, P.1 aFrijns, J.0 tJournal of environmental management.g2017, dElsevier Ltdx0301-47977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2017.11.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03183naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245008500163300001600248520148000264592002801744650003201772650001801804650002701822650001401849650001501863650001001878650001401888650001101902650002501913650001101938650002201949650001801971650002301989650001702012650002702029650002802056650001202084650001802096650002102114650001702135650000902152650001702161650002602178650001902204653002102223653001702244653002802261653002202289653001502311700001702326700001402343700001602357700001402373773008902387856008402476852000902560655001202569IND60544861620221117223734.0160901e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054486162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2015.02.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYan, Wei10aAcute nitrogen dioxide inhalation induces mitochondrial dysfunction in rat brain  ap. 416-424.  aRecent epidemiological literatures imply that NO2 is a potential risk factor of neurological disorders. Whereas, the pathogenesis of various neurological diseases has been confirmed correlate to mitochondrial dysfunction, and mitochondria play the crucial roles in energy metabolism, free radicals production and apoptosis triggering in response to neuronal injury. Therefore, to clarify the possible mechanisms for NO2-induced neurotoxicity, in the present study, we investigated the possible effects of acute NO2 inhalation (5, 10 and 20mg/m3 with 5h/day for 7 days) on energy metabolism and biogenesis in rat cortex, mainly including mitochondrial ultrastructure, mitochondrial membrane potential, cytochrome c oxidase activity, cytochrome c oxidase (CO) and ATP synthase subunits, ATP content, and transcription factors. The results showed that NO2 exposure induced mitochondrial morphological changes in rat cortex, and the alteration was coupled with the abnormality of mitochondrial energy metabolism, including decreased respiratory complexes, reduced ATP production and increased production of ROS. Also, increased ROS in turn caused mitochondrial membrane damage, energy production defect and mitochondrial biogenesis inhibition. It suggests the significantly damaged mitochondrial energy metabolism and impaired biogenesis in rat brain after NO2 exposure, and provides a new understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms of NO2-induced neurological disorders.  aPublisher supplied data 3aH-transporting ATP synthase 3aacute effects 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aapoptosis 3abiogenesis 3abrain 3abreathing 3acortex 3acytochrome-c oxidase 3aenergy 3aenergy metabolism 3afree radicals 3amembrane potential 3amitochondria 3amitochondrial membrane 3anervous system diseases 3aneurons 3aneurotoxicity 3anitrogen dioxide 3apathogenesis 3arats 3arisk factors 3atranscription factors 3aultrastructure 0aNitrogen dioxide 0aMitochondria 0aReactive oxygen species 0aEnergy metabolism 0aBiogenesis1 aJi, Xiaotong1 aShi, Jing1 aLi, Guangke1 aSang, Nan0 tEnvironmental Research.g2015 Apr., v. 138 p.416-424dElsevier Inc.x0013-93517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2015.02.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03585naa a2200793 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002400149245012500173300001600298520146200314592002801776650002401804650002201828650001801850650001701868650000901885650001201894650002901906650001501935650002001950650001901970650001901989650001502008650001902023653000702042653001102049653001202060653000802072653000802080653000802088653000902096653000702105653000702112653001002119653000702129653000702136653001002143653000802153653000802161653000702169653000902176653000802185653000902193653000702202653000702209653001302216653000802229653002802237653001502265653001902280653003202299653003102331653002102362653003002383700002602413700002102439700002202460700002802482700005702510700002402567773009502591856008402686852000902770655001202779IND60573097020221118123257.0190416e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057309702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.algal.2017.05.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGiovanardi, Martina10aHigher packing of thylakoid complexes ensures a preserved Photosystem II activity in mixotrophic Neochloris oleoabundans  ap. 322-332.  aA better understanding of the microalgal basic biology is still required to improve the feasibility of algal bio-products. The photosynthetic capability is one of the parameters that need further progress in research. A superior PSII activity was previously described in the green alga Neochloris oleoabundans. In this study, N. oleoabundans was grown in a glucose-supplied culture medium, in order to provide new information on the organisation and interaction of thylakoid protein complexes under mixotrophy. Fluorescence measurements suggested a strong association of light harvesting complex II (LHCII) to PSII in mixotrophic samples, confirmed by the lack of LHCII phosphorylation under growth light and the presence of PSI-PSII-LHCII megacomplexes in Blue-Native gel profile. The chloroplast ultrastructure was accordingly characterised by a higher degree of thylakoid appression compared to autotrophic microalgae. This also affected the capability of mixotrophic microalgae to avoid photodamage when exposed to high-light conditions. On the whole, it emerged that the presence of glucose affected the photosynthetic performance of mixotrophic samples, apparently limiting the dynamicity of thylakoid protein complexes. As a consequence, PSII is preserved against degradation and the PSI:PSII is lowered upon mixotrophic growth. Apparent increase in PSII photochemical activity was attributed to a down-regulated chlororespiratory electron recycling.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEttlia oleoabundans 3aautotrophic algae 3aculture media 3afluorescence 3agels 3aglucose 3alight harvesting complex 3amicroalgae 3aphosphorylation 3aphotochemistry 3aphotosystem II 3athylakoids 3aultrastructure 0a2D 0aATPase 0aBN-PAGE 0aBSA 0aChl 0aCyt 0aDCMU 0aF0 0aFM 0aFM′ 0aFt 0aFV 0aFV/FM 0aLHC 0aPAM 0aPQ 0aPQH2 0aPSI 0aPSII 0aQA 0aQB 0aSDS-PAGE 0aTEM 0aNeochloris oleoabundans 0aMixotrophy 0aPhotosystem II 0aThylakoid protein complexes 0aPhotosynthetic performance 0aBlue-Native PAGE 0aFluorescence measurements1 aPoggioli, Mariachiara1 aFerroni, Lorenzo1 aLespinasse, Maija1 aBaldisserotto, Costanza1 aAro, Eva-Mari1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2922-14351 aPancaldi, Simonetta0 tAlgal research.g2017 July, v. 25 p.322-332dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12360x2211-92647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.algal.2017.05.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03985naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100006000192245008300252300001800335506007600353520195800429592002802387506003702415650001802452650001302470650001602483650001302499650002802512650002502540650001502565650002002580650001302600650001502613650001402628650001302642650000902655650001602664650001302680650001202693651001202705653001902717653002502736653003002761653001702791700002102808700001902829700002002848700001802868700001702886700002302903700002302926700001702949700001502966700002102981700002103002700001703023700001803040700001703058700001803075773009903093856008603192852000903278655001203287IND60619607120221207111549.0200318e20181119xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061960712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2018.10.0202doi7 aPMC62380782pmcid7 a303668062pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUmeh, Gregory C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4471-783410aMicro-planning for immunization in Kaduna State, Nigeria: Lessons learnt, 2017  ap. 7361-7368.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe OPV 3 coverage for Kaduna State, 12–23 months old children was 34.4%. The low OPV 3 coverage, due mainly to weak demand for routine antigens and the need to rapidly boost population immunity against the disabling Wild Polio Virus (WPV), led the Global Polio Eradication Initiatives (GPEI) to increase supplemental OPV campaigns in Kaduna State, despite the huge cost and great burden on personnel. The OPV campaigns, especially in high risk (low vaccine uptake, <80% OPV 3 coverage and high vaccines refusal rate) states of northern Nigeria with poliovirus transmission has resulted in overestimated denominators or target population, as the highest ever vaccinated is used to set OPV campaign targets.We utilized a cross-sectional study that assessed the impacts and possible solutions to the challenges of overestimated denominators in immunization services planning, delivery and performance evaluation in Kaduna State, Nigeria. We used both descriptive and quantitative approaches. We enumerated households and obtained the target populations for routine immunization (<1 year), polio campaign (<5 years) and acute flaccid paralysis surveillance (<15 years).We found a significant difference in mean scores between the micro-planning and supplemental vaccination data on a number of <5 years (M = 102967, SD = 62405, micro-planning compared to M = 157716, SD = 72212, supplemental vaccination, p < 0.05). We also found a significant difference in mean scores between the micro-planning and projected census data on a number of <1 year (M = 26128, SD = 16828, micro-planning compared to M = 14154, SD = 4894, census, p < 0.05).Periodic household-based micro-planning, aided with the use of technology for validation remains a useful tool in addressing gaps in immunization planning, delivery and performance evaluation in developing countries, such as Nigeria with overestimated denominators.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEnterovirus C 3aantigens 3acensus data 3achildren 3across-sectional studies 3adeveloping countries 3ahouseholds 3ahuman resources 3aimmunity 3amonitoring 3aparalysis 3aplanning 3arisk 3avaccination 3avaccines 3aviruses 3aNigeria 0aMicro-planning 0aRoutine immunization 0aSupplemental immunization 0aKaduna state1 aMadubu, Dauda M.1 aKorir, Charles1 aLoveday, Nkwogu1 aIshaku, Sambo1 aIyal, Hadiza1 aOmoleke, Semeeh A.1 aI Nomhwange, Terna1 aAliyu, Atiku1 aMusa, Audu1 aDankoli, Raymond1 aMI.

PCV13 is expected to reduce vaccine type (VT) nasopharyngeal carriage, leading to reduced transmission and herd protection.We compared pneumococcal carriage in rural Karonga District, Malawi, pre-vaccine in 2009–2011 and post-vaccine in 2014 using a combination of cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from a cohort of mother-infant pairs and household members <16 years. Pneumococci from 2009 to 2011 were serogrouped using latex agglutination and serotyped by Quellung reaction. In 2014, latex agglutination was used for both steps. Carriage prevalence ratios using prevalence data from before and after vaccine introduction were calculated by log-binomial regression, adjusted for age, seasonality and household composition. Participating infants in 2014 received PCV13 as part of routine immunisation.VT carriage prior to PCV-13 introduction was 11.4%, 45.1%, 28.2%, 21.2% and 6.6% for 6-week old infants, 18-week old infants, children 1–4 years, children 5–15 years and mothers, respectively. After vaccine introduction, VT carriage decreased among vaccinated 18-week old infants (adjusted prevalence ratio 0.24 (95%CI 0.08–0.75)), vaccinated children 1–4 years (0.54 (0.33–0.88)), unvaccinated children 5–15 years (0.37 (0.17–0.78)) and mothers (0.34 (0.15–0.79)). No decrease in VT carriage was observed for 6-week old infants too young to be vaccinated (1.07 (0.38–3.02)) and PCV-13 ineligible children 1–4 years (0.84 (0.53–1.33)). Non-VT carriage increased only among vaccinated children 1–4 years (1.58 (1.21–2.06)).There is evidence of reduced VT pneumococcal carriage three years after vaccine introduction in this rural Malawian population with good vaccine coverage using a 3 + 0 schedule. However carriage was sustained among 6-week-old infants and PCV13 ineligible 1–4 year olds, and there was some indication of serotype replacement in vaccinated 1–4 year olds.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aagglutination 3achildren 3aherds 3ahouseholds 3ainfants 3alatex 3alongitudinal studies 3amothers 3aserotypes 3avaccination 3avaccines 3aMalawi 0aStreptococcus pneumoniae 0aCarriage 0aInfant 0aAfrica 0aCohort studies 0aPneumococcal conjugate vaccine1 aTafatatha, Terence1 aPhiri, Amos1 aSwarthout, Todd D1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5285-70391 aAlaerts, Maaike1 aCrampin, Amelia C1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1513-43301 aChisambo, Christina1 aMwiba, Oddie1 aRead, Jonathan M1 aFrench, Neil0 tVaccine.g2018 Nov. 19, v. 36, no. 48 p.7369-7376dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2018.10.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03146naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001800143245014000161300001600301520140100317592002801718650002201746650001701768650002101785650001801806650002201824650002501846650001701871650001301888650002401901650001701925650002401942650002301966650002101989650001802010650001002028650002902038650001102067650001202078650001602090650001502106651002102121653002502142653003002167653001702197653002202214653001902236653001902255653001702274653002302291700001802314700001502332773012302347856007702470852000902547655001202556IND60563033520221120180039.0170209e20161221xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056303352DNAL7 a10.1139/cjz-2016-01892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCrombie, M.D.10aNest-site preference and reproductive performance of Song Sparrows (Melospizamelodia) in historically extant and colonist shrub species  ap. 115-121.  aMany studies report mixed results on the influence of invasive plants on native animals, partly due to uncertainties about habitat preference and reproductive performance in native animals before and after plant invasion. We used vegetation surveys 20 years apart and 18 years of breeding data from Song Sparrows (Melospiza melodia (A. Wilson, 1810)) to compare nest-site preference and reproductive performance during the colonization of Mandarte Island, British Columbia, by one shrub species native to the region but historically absent from the island (red elderberry, Sambucus racemosa L.) and another species that is exotic to North America (Himalayan blackberry, Rubus armeniacus Focke = Rubus bifrons Vest). Nest-site preference declined where red elderberry increased but was unrelated to change in the cover of Himalayan blackberry. Song Sparrows nested in trailing blackberry (Rubus ursinus Cham. and Schltdl.) and its exotic congener Himalayan blackberry in preference to two common shrubs native to Mandarte Island (Nootka rose, Rosa nutkana C. Presl; snowberry, Symphoricarpos albus (L.) S.F. Blake) and built just 1 of 1051 nests in red elderberry. In contrast, reproductive performance was similar in all shrub species used regularly as nest substrates. Our results show that Song Sparrow nest-site preference and reproductive performance were independent of plant species origin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMelospiza melodia 3aRosa nutkana 3aRubus armeniacus 3aRubus ursinus 3aSambucus racemosa 3aSymphoricarpos albus 3ablackberries 3abreeding 3aecological invasion 3aelderberries 3ahabitat preferences 3aindigenous species 3ainvasive species 3anesting sites 3anests 3areproductive performance 3ashrubs 3asurveys 3auncertainty 3avegetation 3aBritish Columbia 0aHimalayan blackberry 0ainvasive plant management 0aSong Sparrow 0aMelospiza melodia 0ared elderberry 0anest substrate 0anest success 0ashrub colonization1 aGermain, R.R.1 aArcese, P.0 tCanadian journal of zoology.g2016 Dec. 21, v. 95, no. 2 p.115-121dNRC Research PresswJournal:19146x0008-43017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjz-2016-01893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02824naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245014500168300001300313520148600326592002801812650001701840650002101857650001201878650001501890650005001905650001201955650001401967650000901981650001901990650002502009650002102034651001402055653001202069653002602081653001802107653002102125653001402146700001702160700002102177773008902198856008202287852000902369655001202378IND60585845920221123042751.0220523e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058584592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jag.2017.10.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSianturi, Riswan10aMapping cropping patterns in irrigated rice fields in West Java: Towards mapping vulnerability to flooding using time-series MODIS imageries  ap. 1-13.  aInformation on the vulnerability to flooding is vital to understand the potential damages from flood events. A method to determine the vulnerability to flooding in irrigated rice fields using the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) was proposed in this study. In doing so, the time-series EVI derived from time-series 8day 500m spatial resolution MODIS imageries (MOD09A1) was used to generate cropping patterns in irrigated rice fields in West Java. Cropping patterns were derived from the spatial distribution and phenology metrics so that it is possible to show the variation of vulnerability in space and time. Vulnerability curves and cropping patterns were used to determine the vulnerability to flooding in irrigated rice fields. Cropping patterns capture the shift in the vulnerability, which may lead to either an increase or decrease of the degree of damage in rice fields of origin and other rice fields. The comparison of rice field areas between MOD09A1 and ALOS PALSAR and MOD09A1 and Agricultural Statistics showed consistent results with R²=0.81 and R²=0.93, respectively. The estimated and observed DOYs showed RMSEs=9.21, 9.29, and 9.69days for the Start of Season (SOS), heading stage, and End of Season (EOS), respectively. Using the method, one can estimate the relative damage provided available information on the flood depth and velocity. The results of the study may support the efforts to reduce the potential damages from flooding in irrigated rice fields.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOryza sativa 3acropping systems 3aheading 3airrigation 3amoderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer 3apaddies 3aphenology 3arice 3aspace and time 3atime series analysis 3avegetation index 3aIndonesia 0aMOD09A1 0aIrrigated rice fields 0aVulnerability 0aCropping pattern 0aWest java1 aJetten, V.G.1 aSartohadi, Junun0 tITC journal.g2018 Apr., v. 66 p.1-13dElsevier B.V.wJournal:22337x1569-84327nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jag.2017.10.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02259naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245006400169300001800233520107800251592002801329650002201357650002501379650001801404650001501422650001401437650001401451650002601465650001301491650001601504653003201520653002401552653002801576653002201604700002101626700002001647773009901667856008601766852000901852655001201861IND60531919320221118195630.0190319e20160407xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053191932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2016.03.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiyairi, Isao10aImmunization practices in solid organ transplant recipients  ap. 1958-1964.  aVaccine-preventable diseases are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in solid organ transplant recipients who undergo immunosuppression after transplantation. The primary strategy for immunizing transplant recipients is to deliver all potential vaccines prior to transplantation. However, time constraints limit the number of vaccines that may be delivered. In such cases, the administration of live attenuated vaccines that are contraindicated after transplantation should be prioritized. Simultaneous vaccination is also encouraged to maximize the number of vaccines delivered. Immunity induced by both inactivated and live vaccines wane after transplantation. The limited but available evidence suggests that immunization using inactivated vaccines in transplant recipients is both effective and safe. An increasing number of studies also suggest that once patients are under minimal immunosuppression, live attenuated vaccines may be given effectively and safely. The need for serologic monitoring and booster immunizations remain issues for future research.  aPublisher supplied data 3aimmunosuppression 3ainactivated vaccines 3alive vaccines 3amonitoring 3amorbidity 3amortality 3aorgan transplantation 3apatients 3avaccination 0aSolid organ transplantation 0aInactivated vaccine 0aLive attenuated vaccine 0aImmunosuppression1 aFunaki, Takanori1 aSaitoh, Akihiko0 tVaccine.g2016 Apr. 07, v. 34, no. 16 p.1958-1964dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2016.03.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02827naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245012600168500002200294520134400316592002801660650002101688650002201709650002201731650001201753650001201765650001001777650001501787650001901802650000701821650001301828650002101841650001201862650001501874650002601889650002201915650001601937650002201953650001001975653002201985653002302007653002302030700002002053700002102073700002302094773014702117856004802264852000902312655001202321IND60795565420221121234238.0221004e20220929xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079556542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fbp.2022.09.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZerva, Anastasia10aTransxylosylation of stevioside by a novel GH39 β-xylosidase, and simultaneous valorization of agroindustrial byproducts  aPre-press version  aStevia rebaudiana Bertoni is becoming increasingly popular as a sweetener, due to its high steviol glycoside content. However, the bitter aftertaste of those compounds is an issue for consumers, which can be alleviated with the addition of glycosyl substituents to the molecule. β-Xylosidases are known to transxylosylate various acceptors, mostly alcohols and sugars. In this work, a putative novel β-xylosidase gene from Ruminiclostridium cellulolyticum was heterologously expressed in E. coli, purified and characterized. The recombinant enzyme RcXyl39A, belonging to CAZy family GH39, showed satisfactory thermostability and tolerance towards product inhibition, while it was active in a wide pH and temperature range. Surprisingly, RcXyl39A was shown to possess a relaxed substrate specificity, since it was able to cleave various synthetic substrates, but also polymeric xylans. RcXyl39A was applied to the transxylosylation of stevioside, using enzymatically hydrolyzed xylan as a mixture of donor sugars. After optimization of several process parameters, the final yield obtained for stevioside conversion reached 27.4 ± 0.6 %. The results of the present study indicate that RcXyl39A could be applied to the saccharification of lignocellulosic biomass, but also to the synthesis of novel compounds with desirable properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aStevia rebaudiana 3abiobased products 3abiomass 3aenzymes 3agenes 3aglycosides 3alignocellulose 3apH 3apolymers 3asaccharification 3asteviol 3astevioside 3asubstrate specificity 3ataste sensitivity 3atemperature 3athermal stability 3axylan 0aTransxylosylation 0aGH39 β-xylosidase 0aXylan valorization1 aChorozian, Koar1 aMohammadi, Milad1 aTopakas, Evangelos0 tFood and bioproducts processing.g2022 Sept. 29, dElsevier LtdaInstitution of Chemical Engineers (IChemE)wJournal:jnl47636x0960-30857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fbp.2022.09.015  aDNAL 7aarticle02129naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245012100170300001600291520103900307592002801346650001201374650001901386650000901405650003601414651003101450653002201481653001001503653001901513653001901532653002801551773012101579856008201700852000901782655001201791IND60126970320221119224100.0150428e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012697032DNAL7 a10.2993/0278-0771-33.1.1482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJones, Emily Lena10aSubsistence Change Among the 17Th-Century Diné? A Reanalysis of the Faunas from the Fruitland Data Recovery Project  ap. 148-166.  aThe question of when the Diné (or Navajo) became a distinct ethnic group has been the focus of research for over a century. Recent archaeological work in the Dinetah region of the American Southwest suggests that the Gobernador phase of Diné prehistory –roughly dated from A.D. 1650 to 1780– was a critical period for Diné ethnogenesis. Archaeological faunas from the Fruitland Data Recovery Project have been used to support this argument; these faunas seem to indicate a shift in subsistence from diets focused on small prey to those focused on larger animals between the Dinétah (A.D. 1500–1650) and Gobernador phases. A reanalysis of the Fruitland Project faunas, involving both refitting of bone and attention to taphonomic issues, does show an increase in representation of large prey during the Gobernador phase; however, this trend does not seem to be related to improved hunting efficiency or encounter rates. Rather, the increase may reflect changes in Diné subsistence and mobility in response to climate change.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimals 3aclimate change 3adiet 3anationalities and ethnic groups 3aSouthwestern United States 0aNavajo prehistory 0aDiné 0acontact period 0azooarchaeology 0asubsistence transitions0 tJournal of ethnobiology.g2013 June, v. 33, no. 1 p.148-166dSociety of EthnobiologywJournal:19742x2162-44967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2993/0278-0771-33.1.1483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02855naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005100092040001800143100002000161245007600181300001300257500000900270520171500279592002801994650001402022650002802036650002402064650002202088650001602110650001702126650001402143650002202157650002202179650001802201700002002219700001702239773011802256852000902374856009802383655001202481IND2059950620221119024539.0191122e199701  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205995062DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci1997.0011183X003700010002x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrown, A.

For dealing with the increasing size of collections, the “core collection” offers one strategy. However, the problems of managing increasing species diversity are only just emerging, particularly in the germplasm collections of wild species. Wild collections encompass those of forest trees, forage plants, medicinal and industrial plants, the wild relatives of cultivated plants, and plant species designated as endangered. Regenerating such collections is a particular problem. In all cases, the accessions of wild species are generally more costly to regenerate than those of cultivated species. This is because of their life history, breeding system, genetic structure, ecology, and lack of domestication. Indeed it is worth asking why bother to regenerate wild accessions at all, and instead rely on resampling conserved sources in situ, or on frozen DNA libraries, or both. Modern empirical studies of the population genetics of wild populations focus on host-pathogen coevolution, spatial subpopulation structure and dynamics, restricted sampiing strategies, breeding system variation, and colonizing history and molecular divergence and phylogeny. Each of these topics has important lessons for the optimum prioritizing of accessions, or the best methods of their regeneration.

Thus, E2 is a suitable target antigen for the development of genetically engineered CSFV vaccines. However, these vaccines cannot generate complete protective immunity in their hosts, thereby limiting the scope of applications under field conditions. IFN-γ is an immune adjuvant that has been shown to enhance antigen immune response in various experimental models. In this study, porcine IFN-γ was used to improve the immunogenicity of the CSFV E2 subunit vaccine in pigs. Pigs were immunized with E2 subunit vaccine alone or in combination with IFN-γ. Results demonstrated that porcine IFN-γ did not enhance the CSFV-specific antibody and neutralizing antibody titers compared with the E2 subunit vaccine alone. However, co-administration of the E2 and IFN-γ subunit vaccines significantly enhanced the CSFV-specific IFN-γ expression. These findings indicated that porcine IFN-γ can increase cellular immune responses to E2 protein in pigs. Furthermore, co-immunization with E2 + IFN-γ subunit vaccine and C-strain conferred complete protection against CSFV. In contrast, E2 subunit vaccines provided incomplete protection in pigs. These results indicated that using IFN-γ as an adjuvant with CSFV E2 subunit vaccines can enhance the specific protective immune response. Therefore, E2 + IFN-γ subunit vaccine is a promising marker vaccine candidate for the control and eradication of CSF.  aPublisher supplied data 3aClassical swine fever virus 3aadjuvants 3aantigens 3acell-mediated immunity 3agenetic engineering 3aglycoproteins 3ahosts 3aimmune response 3aimmunogenicity 3ainterferon-gamma 3amodels 3aneutralizing antibodies 3apiglets 3asubunit vaccines 3aweaning 0aClassical swine fever virus 0aE2 protein 0aPorcine IFN-γ 0aSubunit vaccine 0aProtective immune response1 aWang, Wenwei,1 aZhao, Zekai1 aWang, Jianjian1 aChen, Huanchun1 aQian, Ping1 aLi, Xiangmin0 tVaccine.g2018 Nov. 19, v. 36, no. 48 p.7353-7360dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2018.10.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02737naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002300141245010700164300001400271500001400285520134400299592002801643650002201671650002901693650002001722650001201742650001401754650001001768650001801778650002301796650001101819650001701830650001301847650002101860650001901881650001101900650001001911653001601921653001201937653001101949700002501960700001901985700002002004773014702024856007502171852000902246655001202255IND60710133520221119130342.0200908e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071013352DNAL7 a10.18805/ijar.B-6872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSembiring, Sabarta10aEvaluation of kepok banana corm fermented with Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Aspergillus niger as feeds  ap. 70-73.  aNAL-light  aThis study evaluated the nutritional and tannin contents of cooked Kepok banana corm, fermented with Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Aspergillus niger. Corm meal was pretreated by steam for 1 hour at 102°C before fermenting. The pretreated corms were inoculated with 10% (w/v) inoculum dose with additional nutrient mono-culture or co-culture. A completely randomized design with a 3 × 3 factorial arrangement was used to investigate two main factors: microbial strains and incubation time, with three subfactors each, resulting in nine treatment combinations and three replications. The microbial strain and incubation time significantly (P<0.01) affected the nutrient content of fermented Kepok banana corms. The highest dry matter content (91.84%) was achieved by incubation with S. cerevisiae for 48 h, while 89.61% organic matter was obtained by fermentation with both S. cerevisiae + A. niger for 48 h. The highest crude protein content was 5.81%, which resulted from treatment with S. cerevisiae for 96 h, increasing the crude protein by 61% compared to the control (3.58% crude protein). Fermentation by the microbe consortium (S. cerevisiae + A. niger) for 72 h, produced maximum starch (35.54 g/100 g) and energy (3511 Kcal/kg) values. Thus, the fermented products are a potential source of energy, to be used as feed ingredients.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus niger 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aanimal research 3abananas 3acoculture 3acorms 3acrude protein 3adry matter content 3aenergy 3afermentation 3ainoculum 3anutrient content 3aorganic matter 3astarch 3asteam 0aBanana corm 0aCulture 0aTannin1 aTrisunuwati, Pratiwi1 aSjofjan, Osfar1 aDjunaidi, Irfan0 tIndian journal of animal research.g2020 Jan., v. 54, no. 1 p.70-73dAgricultural Research Communication CentrewJournal:2025x0976-05557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.18805/ijar.B-6873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03271naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245011000168300001600278520145100294592002801745650001601773650001901789650000901808650001301817650001101830650001201841650001401853650001901867650001801886650002401904650001401928650001601942650002101958653000701979653000701986653000701993653000702000653000802007653000702015653000702022653000702029653000802036653000802044653002202052653002502074653001202099653001202111653002702123700003102150700001802181700002602199700001902225700002402244700001802268700002602286700002102312700002502333700002302358700002202381773008902403856008402492852000902576655001202585IND60544862020221117223916.0160901e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054486202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2015.02.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLlop, Sabrina10aSynergism between exposure to mercury and use of iodine supplements on thyroid hormones in pregnant women  ap. 298-305.  aTo evaluate the association between mercury exposure and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), total triiodothyronine (TT3) and free thyroxine (FT4) levels during pregnancy as well as to explore if there is any synergic action between mercury and intake of iodine from different sources.The study population was 1407 pregnant women participating in the Spanish INMA birth cohort study. Total mercury concentrations were analyzed in cord blood. Thyroid hormones (THs) were measured in serum samples collected at 13.2±1.5 weeks of gestation. The association between mercury and TH levels was evaluated with multivariate linear regression models. Effect modification caused by iodine intake from supplements and diet was also evaluated.The geometric means of TSH, TT3, FT4 and mercury were 1.1μU/L, 2.4nmol/L, 10.5pmol/L and 7.7μg/L, respectively. Mercury levels were marginally significantly associated with TT3 (β: −0.05; 95%CI: −0.10, 0.01), but were neither associated with TSH nor FT4. The inverse association between mercury and TT3 levels was stronger among the iodine supplement consumers (−0.08; 95%CI: −0.15, −0.02, interaction p-value=0.07). The association with FT4 followed the same pattern, albeit not significant.Prenatal mercury exposure was inversely associated with TT3 levels among women who took iodine supplements during pregnancy. These results could be of public health concern, although further research is needed.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood serum 3acohort studies 3adiet 3ageometry 3aiodine 3amercury 3apregnancy 3apregnant women 3apublic health 3aregression analysis 3asynergism 3athyrotropin 3atriiodothyronine 0aCI 0aD1 0aD2 0aD3 0aFT4 0aGM 0asd 0aTH 0aTSH 0aTT3 0aPrenatal exposure 0aEndocrine disruption 0aMercury 0aThyroid 0aIodine supplementation1 aLopez-Espinosa, Maria-Jose1 aMurcia, Mario1 aAlvarez-Pedrerol, Mar1 aVioque, Jesús1 aAguinagalde, Xabier1 aJulvez, Jordi1 aAurrekoetxea, Juan J.1 aEspada, Mercedes1 aSanta-Marina, Loreto1 aRebagliato, Marisa1 aBallester, Ferran0 tEnvironmental Research.g2015 Apr., v. 138 p.298-305dElsevier Inc.x0013-93517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2015.02.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03282naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245015100171300001600322520175900338592002802097650002502125650002502150650001502175650001202190650002202202650002302224650002602247650002402273650002202297650001302319650001102332650002102343650002502364653002502389653001402414653001902428653001202447700001802459700002102477700002402498700002602522700002102548773011302569856008402682961001302766852000902779655001202788IND60535448320221119175317.0190403e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053544832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agwat.2015.01.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPuangbut, Darunee10aVariation of inulin content, inulin yield and water use efficiency for inulin yield in Jerusalem artichoke genotypes under different water regimes  ap. 142-150.  aThe information on genotypic variation for inulin content, inulin yield and water use efficiency of inulin yield (WUEi) in response to drought is limited. This study was to investigate the genetic variability in inulin content, inulin yield and WUEi of Jerusalem artichoke (Helianthus tuberosus L.) under different water regimes. A field experiment was conducted for two years during September to January 2010/2011 and 2011/2012. A strip plot design with four replications was used in both years. Horizontal factors were three irrigation levels (W1=100% evapotranspiration (ET), W2=75% ET and W3=45% ET) and vertical factors were 12 Jerusalem artichoke genotypes. Data were recorded for inulin content, inulin yield and WUEi at harvest. Significant differences among Jerusalem artichoke genotypes were observed for inulin content, inulin yield and WUEi under W1, W2 and W3 in both years. There were five genotypes (HEL 253, HEL 53, HEL 256, HEL 65 and CN 52867) that exhibited consistently high inulin content and inulin yield across water regimes in both years. Inulin content was increased under W2 conditions but not inulin yield, while WUEi was increased under both W2 and W3 conditions. CN 52867 and HEL 65 were the genotypes with the highest inulin content and inulin yield under limited water conditions in both years. Furthermore, these genotypes showed high WUEi and drought tolerance indices under drought conditions in both years. Improvement of inulin content combined with high WUEi could have contributed to higher inulin yield under limited water conditions. The information on genotypic variation in inulin content and WUEi under drought conditions may have application in genetic improvement of drought resistance in Jerusalem artichoke.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHelianthus tuberosus 3aJerusalem artichokes 3acrop yield 3adrought 3adrought tolerance 3aevapotranspiration 3afield experimentation 3agenetic improvement 3agenetic variation 3agenotype 3ainulin 3airrigation rates 3awater use efficiency 0aHelianthus tuberosus 0aGenotypic 0aDrought stress 0aFructan1 aJogloy, Sanun1 aVorasoot, Nimitr1 aSrijaranai, Supalax1 aHolbrook, Corley Carl1 aAran Patanothai,0 tAgricultural water management.g2015 Apr., v. 152 p.142-150dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8460x0378-37747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2015.01.0053Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02844naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003700113040001800150100002400168245011100192300001600303520145800319592002801777650002001805650001901825650001701844650001301861650002001874650001301894650001001907650000901917650002201926650001401948650001201962650001801974650002701992650003302019650004002052650002502092650002502117650001402142650002702156773011102183856008302294852000902377655001202386IND60082768320221122001309.0141101e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008276832DNAL7 a216002952pmid7 a10.1016/j.ympev.2011.05.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcGowen, Michael R.10aToward the resolution of an explosive radiation—A multilocus phylogeny of oceanic dolphins (Delphinidae)  ap. 345-357.  aOceanic dolphins (Delphinidae) are the product of a rapid radiation that yielded ∼36 extant species of small to medium-sized cetaceans that first emerged in the Late Miocene. Although they are a charismatic group of organisms that have become poster children for marine conservation, many phylogenetic relationships within Delphinidae remain elusive due to the slow molecular evolution of the group and the difficulty of resolving short branches from successive cladogenic events. Here I combine existing and newly generated sequences from four mitochondrial (mt) genes and 20 nuclear (nu) genes to reconstruct a well-supported phylogenetic hypothesis for Delphinidae. This study compares maximum-likelihood and Bayesian inference methods of several data sets including mtDNA, combined nuDNA, gene trees of individual nuDNA loci, and concatenated mtDNA+nuDNA. In addition, I contrast these standard phylogenetic analyses with the species tree reconstruction method of Bayesian concordance analysis (BCA). Despite finding discordance between mtDNA and individual nuDNA loci, the concatenated matrix recovers a completely resolved and robustly supported phylogeny that is also broadly congruent with BCA trees. This study strongly supports groupings such as Delphininae, Lissodelphininae, Globicephalinae, Sotalia+Delphininae, Steno+Orcaella+Globicephalinae, and Leucopleurus acutus, Lagenorhynchus albirostris, and Orcinus orca as basal delphinid taxa.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aLagenorhynchus 3aOrcinus orca 3achildren 3adata collection 3adolphins 3agenes 3aloci 3amitochondrial DNA 3aphylogeny 2aAnimals 2aBayes Theorem 2aCell Nucleusxgenetics 2aDNA, Mitochondrialxgenetics 2aDolphinsxclassificationxgenetics. 2aEvolution, Molecular 2aLikelihood Functions 2aPhylogeny 2aSequence Analysis, DNA0 tMolecular phylogenetics and evolution.g2011 Sept., v. 60, no. 3 p.345-357dElsevier Inc.x1055-79037nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ympev.2011.05.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02268naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001200155245012300167300001400290520096700304592002801271650001901299650001301318650001801331650002001349650004301369650001701412650003201429650002601461650001401487653001401501653001001515653001301525653002401538700001701562700001801579700001701597700001201614700001901626773009001645856009001735852000901825655001201834IND60570771320221120061051.0180904e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057077132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biologicals.2017.06.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Kuo10aProduction of a broad-specificity monoclonal antibody and application as a receptor to detection amatoxins in mushroom  ap. 57-61.  aIn this study, we report the production of a monoclonal broad-specificity monoclonal antibody (mAb) specific for amatoxins and development of an indirect competitive immunoassay for detection of amatoxins in mushroom samples. In the assay, the complete antigen (α-amanitin-OVA) was used as coating antigen, and amatoxins as competitor competes with coating antigen to bind with mAb. Using this approach, The half-maximum inhibition concentrations (IC50) of α-amanitin, β-amanitin and γ-amanitin, and limits of detection (LODs, IC15) were 66.3, 97.4, 163.1 ng/mL and 0.91, 0.98, 0.89 ng/mL, respectively. The LODs for α-amanitin, β-amanitin and γ-amanitin in mushroom samples were 4.55, 4.9, and 4.45 ng/mL. The spiked results were also confirmed by HPLC, which showed a good correlation (R² = 0.996) between the two methods. The results indicated that the developed assay was reliable and suitable for the detection of amatoxins in mushroom samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalpha-amanitin 3aantigens 3abeta-amanitin 3adetection limit 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aimmunoassays 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3amonoclonal antibodies 3amushrooms 0aAmatoxins 0aAssay 0aMushroom 0aMonoclonal antibody1 aMao, Qingwen1 aZang, Xiuyuan1 aZhang, Yanyu1 aLi, Hui1 aZhang, Donghao0 tBiologicals.g2017 Sept., v. 49 p.57-61dElsevier LtdwJournal:11999x1045-10567nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biologicals.2017.06.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03059naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245012600162300002000288520137200308592002801680650004401708650003701752650001501789650002101804650001901825650001401844650001901858650001101877650002201888650002301910650001601933650001301949650001901962650004301981650001502024650001902039650001302058650002002071650000802091650003702099650002102136700001402157700001302171700001402184700001902198700001602217700001802233700001302251700002202264773012402286856007402410852000902484655001202493IND60640522220221119173716.0190504e20160412xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064052222DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra04223f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSargent, William,10aBiocompatible graphene nanosheets grafted with poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) brushes via surface-initiated ARGET ATRP  ap. 35641-35647.  aUsing robust chemistry to graft polymer brushes on graphene nanosheets would promote the development of graphene nanomaterials as a versatile platform for biomedical applications. Based on surface-initiated activators regenerated by the electron transfer atom transfer radical polymerization (ARGET ATRP) technique, the study developed a protocol to prepare well-defined poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (HEMA) brushes on chemically reduced graphene oxide surfaces. ATR-FTIR, XPS and TEM characterizations demonstrate tin(ii) 2-ethylhexanoate to be an efficient reducing agent that provides controlled polymerization with a significant decreased Cu catalyst usage (down to about 20 ppm), and prevents trace amounts of elemental Cu residue on the graphene surface. Fetal bovine serum protein absorption assay reveals the effect of brush backbone structure change to tune the interfacial interaction between graphene nanosheets and proteins. Further, NIH-3T3 fibroblast cell and human umbilical vein endothelial cell viability assays indicate that the obtained graphene nanosheets meet the biocompatibility requirements to support fibroblast cells, even human cells, attach and proliferate. The approach and the graphene–polymer brush hybrid developed in this work should open new opportunities for a broader range of biomedical applications of carbon nanomaterials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aabsorption 3abiocompatibility 3ablood proteins 3acatalysts 3acell viability 3acopper 3aelectron transfer 3afetal bovine serum 3afibroblasts 3agraphene 3agraphene oxide 3ahuman umbilical vein endothelial cells 3ananosheets 3apolymerization 3apolymers 3areducing agents 3atin 3atransmission electron microscopy 3aviability assays1 aGao, Yuan1 aWu, Tong1 aChen, Xin1 aCordie, Travis1 aZhao, Haili1 aXie, Linsheng1 aMa, Yulu1 aTurng, Lih-Sheng,0 tRSC advances.g2016 Apr. 12, v. 6, no. 42 p.35641-35647dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra04223f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03830naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245013000167300001600297520193800313592002802251650002502279650001402304650001402318650001602332650002202348650002002370650002002390650001102410650001502421650001902436650002102455650001102476650002302487650001202510650001102522650002502533650001302558650001102571650001202582650001202594650001202606650001402618650002002632653003402652653004302686653004602729653001402775653002902789653001102818653001002829653002302839653001802862700001702880700002002897700002002917700001502937700002002952773010002972856008703072852000903159655001203168IND60565544220221123023257.0190402e20170801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056554422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2017.01.1242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Bin10aCryoprotective roles of trehalose and alginate oligosaccharides during frozen storage of peeled shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei)  ap. 257-264.  aCryoprotective saccharides are widely accepted additives that reduce thawing loss, maintain texture, and retard protein denaturation in the frozen seafood. The present study aimed to investigate the roles of trehalose and alginate oligosaccharides on cryoprotection of frozen shrimp, primarily focusing on the interactions between myosin and saccharide molecules using a molecular dynamics (MD) simulation analysis. The results indicated that soaking in the trehalose and alginate oligosaccharides solutions markedly reduced thawing and cooking losses in frozen shrimp, with respective values decreasing to 6.02%, 8.14%, and 5.99%, 8.19% after 9weeks of storage, which were significantly lower than that of fresh water treatment (9.75% and 15.09%). Our assumption was that water replacement played a leading role in cryoprotection, as shown in previous experimental results and reports. Furthermore, homology modeling and MD simulations confirmed that trehalose and alginate oligosaccharides substituted the water molecules around the myosin surface by forming hydrogen bonds with polar residues of amino acids, thereby stabilizing the structures in the absence of water during frozen storage. These conditions affected the flexibility of particular amino acid residues, enhanced the residue cross correlations within the two chains of myosin, and also increased the total interaction energy between myosin and water/saccharide molecules, thereby leading to an increase in protein stability. Finally, by comparing the experimental results to that of MD simulation, significant positive correlation existed between saccharides and the stabilization of myosin in shrimp muscle. The findings of the present study may help better understand the cryoprotective mechanisms of saccharides in frozen shrimp, and the two saccharides may be potentially used as alternative additives in seafood to maintain better quality during frozen storage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLitopenaeus vannamei 3aadditives 3aalginates 3aamino acids 3achemical elements 3acooking quality 3acryoprotectants 3aenergy 3afreshwater 3afrozen storage 3ahydrogen bonding 3amodels 3amolecular dynamics 3amuscles 3amyosin 3aprotein denaturation 3aseafoods 3ashrimp 3asoaking 3atexture 3athawing 3atrehalose 3awater treatment 0aTrehalose (PubChem CID: 7427) 0aAlginate sodium (PubChem CID: 5102882) 0aSodium pyrophosphate (PubChem CID: 24403) 0aTrehalose 0aAlginate oligosaccharide 0aMyosin 0aWater 0aMolecular dynamics 0aStabilization1 aWu, Hai-xiao1 aYang, Hui-cheng1 aXiang, Xing-wei1 aLi, Hai-bo1 aDeng, Shang-gui0 tFood chemistry.g2017 Aug. 01, v. 228 p.257-264dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2017.01.1243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01493naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245004400163300002200207520053400229592002800763650002600791650002700817650002400844650001200868650002000880700002400900700002200924700002300946773012700969856007401096852000901170655001201179IND60669481920221117210851.0190920e20151216xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066948192DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra21108e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aElattar, Khaled M.10aAdvances in 1,2,4-triazepines chemistry  ap. 106710-106753.  aThis review reports the literature survey of 1,2,4-triazepines.

In cells, a moderate increase in ROS plays an important role as signaling molecule to promote cell proliferation, whereas a severe increase of ROS causes cell damage. Previous studies have shown that low levels of ROS stimulate cell growth through PS drugs-treating PDT and nonthermal plasma treatment. However, these methods have side effects which are associated with low tissue selectivity and remaining of PS residues. To overcome such shortcomings, we designed hematoporphyrin-incorporated polyurethane (PU) film induced generation of extracellular ROS with singlet oxygen and free radicals. The film can easily control ROS production rate by regulating several parameters including light dose, PS dose. Also, its use facilitates targeted delivery of ROS to the specific lesion. Our study demonstrated that extracellular ROS could induce the formation of intracellular ROS. In vascular endothelial cells, a moderated increase in intracellular ROS also stimulated cell proliferation and cell cycle progression by accurate control of optimum levels of ROS with hematoporphyrin-incorporated polymer films. This modulation of cellular growth is expected to be an effective strategy for the design of next-generation PDT.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3acell cycle 3acell growth 3acell proliferation 3aendothelial cells 3afilms (materials) 3airradiation 3aphotosensitizing agents 3apolyurethanes 3asinglet oxygen 3atissues 0aphotodynamic treatment 0areactive oxygen species 0aHp-PU film 0alocalized delivery 0aendothelial cell proliferation1 aKim, Bong-Jin1 aLee, Mi Hee1 aKwon, Byeong-Ju1 aKim, Min-sŏng,1 aSeon, Gyeung Mi1 aKim, Dohyun1 aNam, Ki Chang1 aWang, Kang-Kyun1 aKim, Yong-Rok1 aPark, Jong-Chul0 tACS applied materials .g2016 Oct. 26, v. 8, no. 42 p.28448-28457dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.6b076283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01388naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245008000163300001800243520036500261592002800626650001500654650002100669650002300690650002300713650001300736650001500749700001800764700002000782700001300802700001900815773013200834856007500966852000901041655001201050IND60658821420221120110600.0190826e20110207xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065882142DNAL7 a10.1039/c0cc03928d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHolzinger, Michael10aMultiple functionalization of single-walled carbon nanotubes by dip coating  ap. 2450-2452.  aSingle walled carbon nanotubes were functionalized with different functionalities by simple dip coating.

However, there is a growing amount of evidence that suggests female choice may often be at odds with their offspring's development. Listronotus maculicollis (Kirby) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) is a serious pest of golf course turfgrass in eastern North America. The weevil develops on few hosts and demonstrates improved fitness traits when developing on Poa annua L. (Poaceae). However, previous population studies observed either weak or no correlations between the spatial dispersion of larval populations and P. annua in the field. In this study, populations on three golf course fairways were monitored over a 4‐year period (2009–2012) to determine whether the lack of spatial associations between preferred hosts and immatures was a result of spatial scale or the density and distribution of conspecifics. Spatial Analysis by Distance IndicEs (SADIE) was used to characterize the spatial dispersion of populations of individual stages (larvae and pupae), P. annua, and turfgrass damage. Life stages were aggregated in each observation, independent of population density or the spatial dispersion of hosts. The distribution of consecutive and non‐consecutive immature stages was found to be correlated in all years, suggesting that females do not avoid patches already occupied by conspecific eggs. Surprisingly, significant spatial associations were not found between larvae and P. annua when the host plant was relatively abundant. Hence, multiple mechanisms may drive L. maculicollis oviposition site‐selection behavior, and a flexible strategy may allow the weevil to persist in areas where P. annua is not the dominant species. Future studies are required to determine what other factors (e.g., natural enemy‐free space, egg or time limitations) influence oviposition behavior.  aPublisher supplied data 3aListronotus 3aPoa annua 3aeggs 3afemales 3agolf courses 3ahost plants 3aimmatures 3ainsect pests 3alarvae 3alarval development 3aoviposition 3apopulation density 3aprogeny 3apupae 3aturf grasses 3aNorth America1 aKoppenhöfer, Albrecht M.0 tEntomologia experimentalis et applicata.g2015 Dec., v. 157, no. 3 p.307-316dKluwer Academic Publishersx0013-87037nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/eea.123633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02015naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002200145245012200167300001800289520083000307592002801137650001601165650002301181650002601204650000901230650002301239650002201262650001401284650001301298650001301311700006001324700005901384773013401443856007901577852000901656655001201665IND60649673920221120151557.0190705e20190614xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064967392DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.9b010612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSonawane, Amol D.10aIron-Promoted Intramolecular Cascade Cyclization for the Synthesis of Selenophene-Fused, Quinoline-Based Heteroacenes  ap. 8602-8614.  aHerein, we report the Fe(III)-promoted linear intramolecular cascade cyclization of 1,3-diyne and 1,3,5-triyne for the construction of selenophene-fused, quinoline-based heteroacene scaffolds. In one step, 1,3-diyne and 1,3,5-triyne were cyclized via diversified internal nucleophiles by using diorganyl diselenides. The diorganyl diselenide plays dual role, one as a cyclizing agent and second as insertion of one and/or two selenium atom and one R′-Se group in the final product. This is highly important in terms of atom economy. Diversified internal nucleophiles were used to afford quinoline- and acridine-based cores. The synthesized selenophene-fused derivatives showed λₘₐₓ, Fₘₐₓ, and Φf values in the range from 370–411 nm, 427–472 nm, and 0.003–0.059, respectively, in dichloromethane solvent.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLewis bases 3achemical structure 3acyclization reactions 3airon 3amethylene chloride 3aorganic chemistry 3aquinoline 3aselenium 3asolvents1 aKubota, Yasuhiro1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9177-43641 aKoketsu, Mamoru1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1496-21770 tJournal of organic chemistry.g2019 June 14, v. 84, no. 13 p.8602-8614dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19181x1520-69047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.joc.9b010613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03266naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002600139245009700165300001600262500002000278520219400298592002802492650001002520650002602530650001302556650001502569650001902584650001602603650002202619651001202641700003402653700002102687773012602708856007302834852000902907655001202916IND60593100220221118025727.0180416e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059310022DNAL7 a10.1111/ddi.127062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDe Camargo, Rafael X.10aAt the landscape level, birds respond strongly to habitat amount but weakly to fragmentation  ap. 629-639.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAIM: It is usually thought that habitat fragmentation acts negatively on species survival, and consequently, on biodiversity. Recent literature challenges whether habitat fragmentation per se affects species richness, beyond the effect of habitat area. Theoretical studies have suggested that fragmentation may matter most when the amount of available habitat is small or at intermediate levels. However, a recent review suggests that the effect of fragmentation on species richness is usually positive. Here, we dissect the richness–fragmentation relationship. What is the effect size? Does it depend upon the amount of habitat cover? How do individual species respond to fragmentation? METHODS: Applying a macroecological approach, we empirically related avian richness and the probability of occurrence (pₒcc) of individual species to fragmentation (number of patches), after controlling for habitat amount in 991 landscapes, each 100‐km², in southern Ontario, Canada. RESULTS: Species richness was strongly related to total habitat amount, but habitat fragmentation had no detectable additional effect. Individual species’ pₒcc related strongly to habitat amount. For some species, pₒcc also related secondarily to habitat fragmentation within landscapes. Logistic models revealed that pₒcc related significantly negatively to fragmentation after controlling for habitat amount for only ~13% of forest‐ and 18% of open‐habitat species bird species. However, pₒcc related significantly positively to fragmentation for even greater proportions of species, including some red‐listed species. Fragmentation effects were not stronger at low or intermediate levels of habitat amount within landscapes. CONCLUSION: In earlier studies, negative effects of isolation were observed at the patch level in experimental manipulations. However, at the landscape level, avian species richness in southern Ontario apparently responds primarily to habitat amount and negligibly to fragmentation. We argue that the evidence is inconsistent with the hypothesis that reducing habitat fragmentation per se would be an effective conservation strategy for birds at the landscape level.  aPublisher supplied data 3abirds 3ahabitat fragmentation 3ahabitats 3alandscapes 3alogit analysis 3aprobability 3aspecies diversity 3aOntario1 aBoucher‐Lalonde, Véronique1 aCurrie, David J.0 tDiversity & distributions.g2018 May, v. 24, no. 5 p.629-639dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3867071x1366-95167nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ddi.127063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02196naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245007000173500002200243520116900265592002801434650001101462650001101473650001501484650001501499650001401514650001401528653002201542653001801564653002001582653002201602653002401624700001401648773007701662856008601739852000901825655001201834IND60584759020221117200135.0171028s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058475902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2017.10.0542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRajarathinam, M.10aEnergy generation in a hybrid harvester under harmonic excitation  aPre-press version  aA hybrid energy harvester combining piezoelectric and electromagnetic transduction mechanisms is designed to harvest vibration energy. The system comprises of a cantilever beam PZT harvester and a magnetic mass hung through a spring at the free end. The beam with PZT harvests energy using piezoelectric effect while the hanging mass oscillates through a copper coil to harvest electromagnetic energy. This paper studies power harvested from the hybrid harvester under harmonic excitation using experimental and analytical evaluations. Comparisons are made with the standalone piezoelectric and electromagnetic harvesters under similar excitation environment. The study shows that the present hybrid harvester can harvest energy at a broad range of frequencies. Furthermore, a few parametric studies are carried out to understand the device output performance. The bandwidth of the harvester and the power harvested within the bandwidth can be designed based on the stiffness of the system and also by changing the electromechanical coupling coefficient. Studies reported also show that bandwidth of harvester can also be increased by increasing the magnetic mass.  aPublisher supplied data 3acopper 3aenergy 3aharvesters 3aharvesting 3amagnetism 3avibration 0aEnergy harvesting 0aPiezoelectric 0aElectromagnetic 0aHybrid generation 0aHarmonic excitation1 aAli, S.F.0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2017, dElsevier Ltdx0196-89047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2017.10.0543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03208naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245009900166300001400265520180700279592002802086650002202114650002502136650002202161650001302183650001302196650002002209650003402229650002002263650001302283650001602296653005102312653006002363653001302423653002902436653002802465700001402493700001502507700001702522700001902539773011002558856008502668852000902753655001202762IND60570311220221122033128.0180830e20171101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057031122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.memsci.2017.06.0872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShi, Mengqi12aA support surface pore structure re-construction method to enhance the flux of TFC RO membrane  ap. 39-52.  aIn this work, a support surface pore structure re-construction method was developed to enhance the flux of thin film composite (TFC) reverse osmosis (RO) membrane. With this method, an aqueous solution of a suitable organic solvent with a certain content, i.e., re-construction agent, was used to swell the support for a period of time and then the swelled support was immersed in water to complete the whole surface pore structure re-construction process. Herein, dimethylacetamide (DMAc) was employed as the organic solvent. It was shown that under proper conditions (i.e., the organic solvent content of 30% v/v, the re-constructing agent contacting time less than 10s and re-constructing agent contacting temperature of 25 ± 5°C), the support surface porosity and surface pore density increased a lot with the support surface pore size increasing slightly. The statistical results (obtained from scanning electron microscope images) showed that at the optimal condition, the support surface porosity and surface pore density increased by 92% and 89%, respectively. The results of RO membrane permselectivity obtained using 2000ppm NaCl solutions and 1.55MPa transmembrane pressure showed that the support surface pore structure re-construction method could improve the flux by 50.5% at most (an increase from 44.0 to 66.2Lm⁻²h⁻¹) without sacrificing the salt rejection (all the membranes had a similar and high rejection of 99.38%). Besides, a support surface pore structure re-construction mechanism was proposed, which showed that the support surface pore structure was mainly determined by the diffusion and coalescence of re-construction agent molecules, and polymer chains mobility. This work provides a facile and effective method for preparing TFC RO membranes with high performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaqueous solutions 3aartificial membranes 3achemical elements 3apolymers 3aporosity 3areverse osmosis 3ascanning electron microscopes 3asodium chloride 3asolvents 3atemperature 0aSupport surface pore structure re-construction 0aThin film composite (TFC) reverse osmosis (RO) membrane 0aSwelling 0aSupport surface porosity 0aSupport surface density1 aWang, Zhi1 aZhao, Song1 aWang, Jixiao1 aWang, Shichang0 tJournal of membrane science.g2017 Nov. 01, v. 541 p.39-52dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12468x0376-73887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2017.06.0873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03222naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100003000149245015800179300001600337520150100353592002801854650002801882650002101910650002101931650002301952650001101975650002601986650001002012650001302022650002402035650002202059650002002081650001102101650001102112650001602123650001002139650001602149651001102165653001702176653002502193653002402218653001502242653001702257700002702274700003402301700006702335700002902402700002802431773012802459856008402587852000902671655001202680IND60613603720221122155107.0190411e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061360372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aspen.2018.05.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHernández-Landa, Lizbeth10aFluctuation and synchronization of adults catches of Diaphorina citri Kuwayama (Hemiptera: Liviidae) in urban backyards and commercial citrus plantations  ap. 745-753.  aStudies to determine the population fluctuation of Diaphorina citri, vector of Candidatus Liberibacter sp., have been carried out mainly in commercial plantations, whereas less have focused in urban areas and their synchrony. The objectives of this work were to monitor D. citri adult populations in Murraya paniculata (OJ) in urban areas and in Persian lime (LM) orchards, to estimate the effect of some environmental factors and to evaluate the synchronization between these populations. Sampling was performed from September 2012 to August 2014 in Veracruz, México. Five urban areas and five commercial Persian lime plots close to each other were selected. Adult D. citri catches were made monthly with yellow traps. Vegetative shoots, temperature and relative humidity were measured throughout the sampling period. Adults of Diaphorina citri were captured in all the sampling sites throughout the two-years sampling period and the populations were more abundant in summer. Significant factors affecting trap catches were the presence of new shoots and temperature. Temperature and relative humidity enclosed a comfort zone between 26 and 28 °C and 75 to 85% respectively. Cross-correlation values were positive across hosts within the same locations and between locations, regardless of the distance, thus suggesting a spatial synchronization in trap catches. This spatial relationship represents a risk of infestation between host species because of the potential movement and dispersal.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCandidatus Liberibacter 3aCitrus latifolia 3aDiaphorina citri 3aMurraya paniculata 3aadults 3aenvironmental factors 3ahosts 3aorchards 3apopulation dynamics 3arelative humidity 3arisk assessment 3ashoots 3asummer 3atemperature 3atraps 3aurban areas 3aMexico 0aCitrus flush 0aHuanglongbing vector 0aSpatial correlation 0aUrban pest 0aComfort zone1 aLópez Collado, José,1 aGonzález-Hernández, Héctor1 aVargas-Mendoza, Mónica1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4484-91131 aOsorio-Acosta, Francisco1 aNava-Tablada, Martha E.0 tJournal of Asia-Pacific entomology.g2018 Sept., v. 21, no. 3 p.745-753dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4413786x1226-86157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aspen.2018.05.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03243naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100005700145245011000202300001800312500002000330520174400350592002802094650001902122650001402141650001202155650000902167650001602176650001402192650001302206650001802219650001102237650001402248650002602262650001102288650002202299650002202321700006202343700006102405700006102466700006202527773012002589856007902709852000902788655001202797IND60649737420221117235600.0190705e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064973742DNAL7 a10.1111/1365-2435.133282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeyer, Lauren1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0374-994110aAbiotic and biotic drivers of fatty acid tracers in ecology: A global analysis of chondrichthyan profiles  ap. 1243-1255.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe use of fatty acid (FA) tracers is a growing tool in trophic ecology, yet FA profiles are driven by a number of abiotic and biotic parameters, making interpretation and appropriate use confusing for ecologists. We undertook a global analysis, compiling FA profiles of 106 chondrichthyan (shark, ray and chimaera) populations, as a model to test the utility of FA profiles to partition a priori trophic guilds, phylogeny, water temperature and habitats. Individual FAs characterizing these four factors were identified, promoting the use of these FAs as ecological tracers across taxa. Habitat type was linked to five FAs: 16:0, 18:0 and biologically essential 22:6ω3 (indicative of the deep sea), 20:5ω3 (non‐complex demersal and deep‐sea demersal) and 20:4ω6 (reef and brackish water). Temperature was a key driver of four FAs (22:5ω6, 22:4ω6, 20:1ω9 and 20:5ω3), while trophic guild and phylogeny were important drivers of two pairs of FA tracers (18:0 and 20:5ω3; 20:1ω9 and 18:1ω9, respectively). This analysis provides a novel understanding of the biological and ecological information that can be inferred from FA profiles and further validates the use of FAs as tracers to investigate the trophic ecology of chondrichthyans. Future research should prioritize ex situ studies to further disentangle the influence of factors across taxa and tissue types, quantify biomodification, enabling the use of quantitative methods for diet determination and further develop ‘FATscapes’ to elucidate fine‐scale trophic geography and climate variability. Additionally, the creation of a taxonomically inclusive FA data repository will enable further meta‐analyses.

It is struggling to shift to a consumption-driven economy, and capital adjustment is crucial to the transition. In response, the principal objective of this study is to analyze the internal market mechanism of China’s capital adjustment. Due to the imperfections of the market, we use the flexible acceleration model, which we put in an IS (Investment – Saving equation)–LM (Liquidity preference – Money supply equation) framework in order to reflect the guiding role of demand. The results show that the flexible acceleration model fits China’s investment well, and the demand-oriented market mechanism of capital adjustment has been formed; however, China’s market adjustment ability is not strong. The adjustment coefficient is only 0.22, and shows a decreasing trend. So, in the capital optimization process, relying on the market alone is not realistic. Furthermore, the calculated replacement rate is up to 0.429, which indicates that China’s capital is less efficient, and there are duplicated assets, idle assets, and wasted investments. The error correction model’s results show that the impact of the interest rate on the investments is not significant in the short term, so the existence of invalid capital is more likely to stem from the soft budget constraints, which require attention.  aPublisher supplied data 3aassets 3acapital 3aequations 3amarkets 3amodels 3asustainable development 3aChina1 aJiang, Xiaochun1 aSun, Wei0 tSustainability.g2018 Mar. 20, v. 10, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su100308863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02603naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001200140245012400152300001800276520137100294592002801665650001201693650001501705650001501720650002301735650001901758650002101777650001601798650001301814650001901827650001401846650000701860650002101867650001101888650002701899700001501926700001301941700001701954773012701971856007402098852000902172655001202181IND60638823520221120052850.0190430e20171207xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063882352DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ay02070h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Fan14aThe adsorption behavior and mechanism of perfluorochemicals on oxidized fluorinated graphene sheets supported on silica  ap. 6645-6652.  aThis is the first report on the fabrication of oxidized fluorinated graphene sheets supported on silica (OFG@silica) for the selective adsorption of perfluorochemicals (PFCs). To increase the affinity towards PFCs, oxidized fluorinated graphene (OFG) was grafted onto amino-terminated alkyl chain modified silica (NH₂-silica), thus producing a mixed-mode material combining fluorophilicity and hydrophobic affinity with anion-exchange properties. The adsorption behavior and mechanism of OFG@silica towards PFCs were explored using a solid phase extraction (SPE) method. For demonstration, several organic analytes including perfluorinated fatty acids (PFFAs), aromatic analytes and fatty acids (FAs) were employed as adsorbates. By analysing the physicochemical properties of analytes, we found that the adsorption amount of analytes was negatively correlated with their molecular acidity coefficient (pKₐ) and positively correlated with their octanol–water distribution coefficient (log D) at pH 7, suggesting that the anion-exchange effect and hydrophobic affinity played a major role in adsorption. Moreover, compared with FAs, PFFAs exhibited a higher adsorption amount which benefited from fluorous–fluorous interactions between PFFAs and OFG@silica. These findings suggested that OFG@silica might be a potential adsorbent for the enrichment of PFCs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidity 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aanalytical methods 3aanion exchange 3achemical species 3afatty acids 3agraphene 3ahydrophobicity 3aoxidation 3apH 3aperfluorocarbons 3asilica 3asolid phase extraction1 aWei, Weili1 aGao, Die1 aXia, Zhining0 tAnalytical methods.g2017 Dec. 7, v. 9, no. 47 p.6645-6652dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ay02070h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02778naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245011700161300002000278520144700298592002801745650002801773650001301801650002801814650002801842650002201870650002601892650001901918650001501937650001901952653002301971653001601994653002302010653002302033700003002056700002202086700001702108700002002125773012902145856007302274852000902347655001202356IND60527770020170818000000.0160715e20141112xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052777002DNAL7 a10.1021/am505161z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJafarzadeh, Shadi10aNanoscale Electrical and Mechanical Characteristics of Conductive Polyaniline Network in Polymer Composite Films  ap. 19168-19175.  aThe presence and characteristics of a connected network of polyaniline (PANI) within a composite coating based on polyester acrylate (PEA) has been investigated. The bulk electrical conductivity of the composite was measured by impedance spectroscopy. It was found that the composite films containing PANI have an electrical conductivity level in the range of semiconductors (order of 10–³ S cm–¹), which suggests the presence of a connected network of the conductive phase. The nanoscopic distribution of such a network within the cured film was characterized by PeakForce tunneling atomic force microscopy (AFM). This method simultaneously provides local information about surface topography and nanomechanical properties, together with electrical conductivity arising from conductive paths connecting the metallic substrate to the surface of the coating. The data demonstrates that a PEA-rich layer exists at the composite–air interface, which hinders the conductive phase to be fully detected at the surface layer. However, by exposing the internal structure of the composites using a microtome, a much higher population of a conductive network of PANI, with higher elastic modulus than the PEA matrix, was observed and characterized. Local current–voltage (I–V) spectroscopy was utilized to investigate the conduction mechanism within the nanocomposite films, and revealed non-Ohmic characteristics of the conductive network.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatomic force microscopy 3acoatings 3adielectric spectroscopy 3aelectrical conductivity 3afilms (materials) 3amechanical properties 3ananocomposites 3apolyesters 3asemiconductors 0aconducting polymer 0apolyaniline 0aconductive network 0aPeakForce TUNA AFM1 aClaesson, P.M.q(Per M.),1 aSundell, Per-Erik1 aPan, Jinshan1 aThormann, Esben0 tACS applied materials .g2014 Nov. 12, v. 6, no. 21 p.19168-19175dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/am505161z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03176naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100005900145245014400204300001800348500002000366520186900386592002802255650001502283650003002298650001502328650001402343650001002357650003002367650001502397650001102412650002502423650001102448650002202459650001902481700005702500773012102557856007902678961001202757852000902769655001202778IND60596396520221121113725.0180619e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059639652DNAL7 a10.1111/1365-2745.129322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaer, Kathryn C.1http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6740-577210aPre‐dispersal seed predation and pollen limitation constrain population growth across the geographic distribution of Astragalus utahensis  ap. 1646-1659.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aA central focus of ecology is to understand the conditions under which biotic interactions affect species’ abundance and distribution. Classic and recent studies have shown that biotic interactions can strongly impact local or regional patterns of species abundance, but two fundamental questions remain largely unaddressed for non‐competitive biotic interactions. First, do the effects of these interactions on population performance change predictably with environmental context? Second, to what extent do population‐scale effects contribute to limiting species’ geographic distributions? To address these questions, we experimentally assessed the extent to which pollen limitation and insect seed predators affected the fecundity and projected population growth rate (λ) of the native forb Astragalus utahensis. We studied populations at the centre and northern edge of the latitudinal range of A. utahensis that occur across a gradient in abiotic harshness characterized primarily by declining mean annual precipitation. Supplementing pollen and suppressing pre‐dispersal seed predators increased seed production similarly within A. utahensis populations at the centre and northern edge of the range. Integral projection population models revealed that relaxing these checks on seed production tended to increase λ in most populations, regardless of their location within the range. Synthesis. Our results suggest that pollen limitation and insect herbivores limit population growth in A. utahensis similarly across the centre‐to‐north portion of its latitudinal distribution. However, because A. utahensis population growth barely reaches the level of replacement at the northern range edge, the reduction in λ resulting from these interactions may contribute to limiting expansion at the northern edge of A. utahensis’ latitudinal range.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAstragalus 3aatmospheric precipitation 3abiocenosis 3afecundity 3aforbs 3ageographical distribution 3agranivores 3amodels 3aphytophagous insects 3apollen 3apopulation growth 3aseed predation1 aMaron, John L.1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4066-33220 tjournal of ecology.g2018 July, v. 106, no. 4 p.1646-1659dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44660x0022-04777nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2745.129323Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/FS  aDNAL 7aarticle01469naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245012700158300001800285520031200303592002800615650002700643650002300670650000900693650000900702650002100711650002100732650001200753650001400765700002100779700002000800700001900820700001900839700001900858773013400877856007501011852000901086655001201095IND60658797520221119090027.0190826e20101019xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065879752DNAL7 a10.1039/c0cc03223a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorita, Clara10aChanges in viscosity behavior from a normal organogelator to a heat-induced gelator for a long-chain amidoamine derivative  ap. 7969-7971.  aA long-chain amidoamine derivative (C18AA) acts as a normal organogelator in toluene, but changes to a heat-induced gelator, exhibiting a phase transition from sol to gel on heating upon addition of aqueous LiCl to the toluene gel.

Among the treatments, the combined treatment of CSE/MH/FA was most effective, reducing the populations of E. coli O157:H7 and L. monocytogenes on beetroot leaves by 3.18 and 3.76 log CFU/g, respectively. In addition, the initial populations of pre-existing bacteria on beetroot leaves were reduced by 2.58 log CFU/g after the combined treatment.

The objective of this study was to assess tillage system ✕ corn hybrid interactions for hybrids commonly grown in the northern United States. Field experiments were conducted at four locations in Wisconsin during 1984 and 1985, including sites with Plano and Nickin silt loam (Typic Argiudoll) and Meridian loam (Mollic Hapludalf) soils. Fifteen hybrids with a range of maturities (90–115 days based on the Minnesota Relative Maturity System) were compared under conventional (moldboard plowing and disking)(CT) and no-till (NT) systems, in a corn-following-corn sequence. Stands were thinned after emergence. No-till resulted in cooler soil temperatures (0.8–3.8°C cooler), lower emergence percentage (7–12% lower), delayed vegetative growth [4.4 (NT) vs. 7.9 (CT) g plant⁻¹], later silking (2–5 days later), and increased grain moisture (10–20 g kg⁻¹) compared to CT. For grain yield, differences occurred for all main effects (locations, years, tillage systems, and hybrids), and most interactions were significant. Yields under NT were 92% (cool spring, 1984) and 96% (warm spring, 1985) of CT yields. On silt-loam soils, NT yields were 92 to 95% of CT yields, but tillage systems had similar yields on the loam soil. Superior-yielding hybrids under CT were also good choices with NT, although delayed growth under NT limited the yield potential of later-maturing (100–115 days) hybrids.  aPublisher supplied data 3aminimum tillage 3aZea mays 3ahybrids 3ano-tillage 3acrop yield 3aMinnesota 0atillage1 aBarnett, K.

Here, we describe risk assessment for nineteen ascidian species and predict coastal regions that are more vulnerable to arrival and expansion. LOCATION: Global. METHODS: We used ensemble niche modelling with three algorithms (Random Forest, Support Vector Machine and MaxEnt) to predict ecologically suitable areas and evaluated our predictions using independent (area under the curve—AUC) and dependent thresholds (true skill statistics—TSS). Environmental variables were maximum and the range of sea surface temperature, mean salinity and maximum chlorophyll. We used our niche modelling results and a modified invasibility index to compare invasion risk among 15 coastal regions. RESULTS: Currently, the most invaded regions are in temperate latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere and Temperate Australasia, which are regions most prone for new invasions. In the tropics, the West and Central Indo‐Pacific are two regions of strong concern, the former with high risk of primary invasion by Botryllus schlosseri and Didemnum perlucidum. In the Southern Hemisphere, the Southwest and Southeast Atlantic are most at risk, both subject to invasion by Botrylloides violaceus, Didemnum vexillum, Molgula manhattensis and Styela clava among others. Regions most at risk of expansion of established invasive species are the Central Indo‐Pacific, Northwest Pacific, Mediterranean and West Indo‐Pacific. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: All regions studied have areas that are suitable and connected to receive new ascidian introductions or that may permit the spread of already established species. Risk comparison of primary introductions and expansion of established introduced ascidians among regions will allow managers to prioritize species of concern for each region both for monitoring future introductions or to enforce control actions towards established species to decrease the risk of regional expansion.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBotrylloides violaceus 3aBotryllus schlosseri 3aMolgula manhattensis 3aStyela clava 3achlorophyll 3acoasts 3aenvironmental factors 3afinancial economics 3ainvasive species 3alatitude 3amodels 3amonitoring 3aprediction 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3asalinity 3asupport vector machines 3asurface water temperature 3atropics 3aAustralasian region1 ade Marco, Paulo, Jr.cJr.1 aAndrade, Andre F.

However, LWIR image acquisition is greatly affected by the atmosphere, which results in obvious spectral noise. Meanwhile, field-based and aerial thermal infrared hyperspectral images are faced with problems such as spatial heterogeneity and salt-and-pepper noise, which results in the traditional spectral-based and object-oriented classification methods performing poorly in the classification task. In this paper, using the emissivity spectra and land surface temperature inversed from LWIR hyperspectral images, a classification framework based on a temperature-emissivity residual network and conditional random field model (TERN-CRF) is proposed. In this method, the residual network is designed to extract and fuse in-depth spectral and local spatial features, and the conditional random field (CRF) model incorporates the spatial-contextual information by the use of the temperature information, to improve the problem of voids and isolated regions in the classification map. To validate the performance of the proposed method, three LWIR datasets acquired by the Hyper-Cam sensor were used in the experiments: an aerial dataset and two field-based datasets of minerals and leaves. The experimental classification results obtained using the LWIR datasets confirm the performance of the proposed TERN-CRF classification method, which is shown to be superior to the traditional hyperspectral image classification methods and a CNN-based method. Furthermore, the CRF post-processing part can effectively alleviate the isolated regions in the classification map.  aThis research was funded in part by the National Key Research and Development Program of China under grant 2021YFE0117100, in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under grants 41771385 and 42071350.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3ahyperspectral imagery 3aimage analysis 3amodels 3aspatial variation 3asurface temperature 3avegetation 0aFourier-transformed long-wave infrared hyperspectral imagery 0aspectral emissivity 0aconditional random field model 0adeep learning 0aclassification1 aHe, Jiani1 aGao, Lyuzhou1 aZhong, Yanfei1 aHu, Xin1 aLi, Zhijiang0 tInternational journal of remote sensing.g2022 May 19, v. 43, no. 10 p.3744-3768dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl45620x1366-59017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2022.21056673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03110naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094024002200126024001900148040001800167100002200185245011700207506007600324520140300400592002801803506003701831650001301868650001501881650001201896650001201908650001101920650002701931650002501958650001001983650002001993650002002013650001002033650002002043650002602063650002202089650001102111650004302122650001102165650002202176700002602198700001902224700001902243700001602262700002502278700002102303700002602324773011902350856007802469852000902547655001202556IND60649370420221207103436.0190704e20180704xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064937042DNAL7 a10.3390/insects90300792doi7 aPMC61646692pmcid7 a299735592pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDanihlík, Jiří10aDoes the Pollen Diet Influence the Production and Expression of Antimicrobial Peptides in Individual Honey Bees?  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWe investigated the importance of protein nutrition for honey bee immunity. Different protein diets (monofloral pollen of Helianthus spp., Sinapis spp., Asparagus spp., Castanea spp., a mixture of the four different pollen and the pollen substitute FeedbeeTM) were fed to honey bees in cages ad libitum. After 18 days of feeding, apidaecin 1 isoforms concentration in the thorax were measured using nanoflow liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. Expression levels of genes, coding for apidaecins and abaecin in the abdomen were determined using quantitative PCR. The results indicate that protein-containing nutrition in adult worker honey bees can trigger certain metabolic responses. Bees without dietary protein showed lower apidaecin 1 isoforms concentrations. The significantly lowest concentration of apidaecin 1 isoforms was found in the group that was fed no pollen diet when compared to Asparagus, Castanea, Helianthus, and Sinapis pollen or the pollen supplement FeedBeeTM. Expression levels of the respective genes were also affected by the protein diets and different expression levels of these two antimicrobial peptides were found. Positive correlation between concentration and gene expression of apidaecins was found. The significance of feeding bees with different protein diets, as well as the importance of pollen nutrition for honey bee immunity is demonstrated.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCastanea 3aHelianthus 3aSinapis 3aabdomen 3aadults 3aantimicrobial peptides 3abiochemical pathways 3acages 3adietary protein 3agene expression 3agenes 3ainsect immunity 3aliquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3apollen 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3athorax 3aworker honey bees1 aŠkrabišová, Mária1 aLenobel, René1 aŠebela, Marek1 aOmar, Eslam1 aPetřivalský, Marek1 aCrailsheim, Karl1 aBrodschneider, Robert0 tInsects.g2018 July 04, v. 9, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2273x2075-44507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/insects90300793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03688naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001500139245009800154300001400252500002000266520208000286592002802366650001402394650001102408650001602419650002102435650002902456650001502485650001902500650001002519650001302529650000902542650002102551650003202572650002102604650002602625650002002651650002602671650000902697650002102706651002102727651001502748700001602763700001702779700002102796700002002817700001602837700001702853700005302870773012902923856007303052852000903125655001203134IND60596967920221119203633.0180622e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059696792DNAL7 a10.1111/lam.128902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVieira, G.10aTerrestrial and marine Antarctic fungi extracts active against Xanthomonas citri subsp. citri  ap. 64-71.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThis study aims to obtain secondary metabolites extracts from filamentous fungi isolated from soil and marine sediments from Antarctica and assess its potential antibacterial activity on Xanthomonas citri subsp. citri, the agent of citrus canker. Metabolites production was conducted in Malt 2% broth at 15°C for 20 days after which intracellular and extracellular extracts were obtained. The extracts were evaluated by cell viability assays through Resazurin Microtitre Assay. From 158 fungal extracts, 33 hampered bacterial growth in vitro. The average inhibition of the extracts obtained from terrestrial (soil) and marine (sediments) fungi was 94 and 97% respectively. These inhibition values were close to the average of 90% cell death for the positive control. MIC90 and MBC for the bioactive extracts were established. Isolates that produced active metabolites against the phytopathogen were identified using molecular taxonomy (ITS‐rRNA sequencing) as: Pseudogymnoascus, Penicillium, Cadophora, Paraconiothyrium and Toxicocladosporium. Antarctic fungal strains isolated from terrestrial and marine sediments were able to produce secondary metabolites with antimicrobial activity against X. citri subsp. citri, highlighting the importance of these microbial genetic resources. These metabolites have potential to be used as alternatives for the control of this plant pathogen. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This manuscript makes an impact on the study of micro‐organisms from extreme habitats and their possible contribution in discovering new active molecules against pathogens of agricultural interest. Studies on the Antarctic continent and its communities have attracted the scientific community due to the long period of isolation and low levels of disturbance that surrounds the region. Knowing the potential of fungi in this region to produce active secondary metabolites, we aim to contribute to the discovery of compounds with antibacterial action in Xanthomonas citri subsp. citri, a plant pathogen present in several regions around the globe.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCadophora 3aCitrus 3aPenicillium 3aPseudogymnoascus 3aantibacterial properties 3acell death 3acell viability 3afungi 3ahabitats 3amalt 3amarine sediments 3amicrobial genetic resources 3amicrobial growth 3amolecular systematics 3aplant pathogens 3asecondary metabolites 3asoil 3aviability assays 3aAntarctic region 3aAntarctica1 aPurić, J.,1 aMorão, L.G.1 ados Santos, J.A.1 aInforsato, F.J.1 aSette, L.D.1 aFerreira, H.1 aSass, D.C.1http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9466-56330 tLetters in applied microbiology.g2018 July, v. 67, no. 1 p.64-71dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl37648x0266-82547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/lam.128903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02249naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001800142245005800160300001600218520135600234592002801590650001101618650001201629650002501641650001701666650001601683651001901699700001401718773012901732856007701861852000901938655001201947IND60765213320221122144729.0220422e20120427xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076521332DNAL7 a10.17221/48/2011-jfs2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartiník, A.10a&nbsp;Snow damage to birch stands in Northern Moravia  ap. 181-192.  aThe condition and snow damage to stands dominated by birch were studied in the area of interest in Northern Moravia. Based on basal area, the share of birch ranged from 68 to 88%. The stands came to existence on fertile sites through natural regeneration and exhibited growth at a level of the best site classes for the Czech Republic. The most severe snow damage to the stands was recorded at the upper stand height of 8&ndash;15 m. The extent of damage in the analyzed stands amounted to 67&ndash;95% of all trees. The unambiguously predominant type of damage was bending while breakages were recorded only in up to 4% of trees. Slenderness ratios of intact trees differed according to the age (height) of stands. The highest values of about 180 were observed in the youngest, ca 5-years-old and about 5 m high stand. Slenderness ratio values of intact trees in a 17-m high stand ranged about 100. The analyzed stands did not show any differences in the slenderness ratio values between intact and damaged trees. Lower values of the ratio for solitary trees (ca 130) in a 5-years-old stand were accompanied by markedly longer crowns (80% of stem) as compared with trees growing in the stand (60% of stem). Differences in the root system architecture were revealed between intact and damaged trees within a stand of about 9 m in height. &nbsp; &nbsp;  aPublisher supplied data 3aBetula 3aforests 3anatural regeneration 3aroot systems 3asnow damage 3aCzech Republic1 aMauer, O.0 tJournal of Forest Science.g, v. 58, no. 4 p.181-192dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:21419x1212-48347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/48/2011-jfs3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03061naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001900137245009400156300001600250520161600266592002801882650002401910650002301934650001301957650001101970650002301981650002102004650001702025650003102042650002002073650002302093650002302116650001402139650001102153650001902164653001402183653001802197653001702215653002402232653002602256700002102282700002102303700001802324700002602342773011902368856007102487852000902558655001202567IND60645197120221119074353.0190528s2019    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064519712DNAL7 a10.1071/MF182322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRomão, Filipe10aCyprinid passage performance in an experimental multislot fishway across distinct seasons  ap. 881-890.  aNew engineering solutions are required to minimise the effects of an increasing number of anthropogenic barriers on watercourses. Longitudinal connectivity must be provided through fishways to allow free passage for the whole fish community. Recently, a multislot fishway (MSF) was developed, with two consecutive vertical slots that divide the overall head drop by two, thus reducing the flow velocity, the magnitude of turbulence and operational discharge compared with a standard vertical slot fishway (VSF) with similar pool and slot dimensions. The present study assessed the effectiveness of a MSF design for two cyprinid species with different ecological traits, under laboratory conditions, namely the Iberian barbel (Luciobarbus bocagei), a large-bodied potamodromous benthic fish, and the southern Iberian chub (Squalius pyrenaicus), a small-bodied water column fish. Experiments were conducted in a full-scale experimental fishway, in spring and autumn. Results showed differences in passage performance between seasons and species. During spring, chub had a higher entry efficiency and shorter transit time to fully negotiate the fishway, whereas no seasonal differences were found for the barbel. Overall, the MSF could be considered a cost-effective design for cyprinids with different ecological traits because it offers lower operational costs than a standard VSF. However, concerns about the entrance and attraction conditions should be addressed. In addition, because of the lower operational discharge, the propensity for obstruction with woody debris and sediments should not be disregarded.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLuciobarbus bocagei 3aLuciobarbus comizo 3aSqualius 3aautumn 3acost effectiveness 3afish communities 3afish ladders 3alaboratory experimentation 3aoperating costs 3apotamodromous fish 3aseasonal variation 3asediments 3aspring 3aturbulent flow 0adischarge 0aeffectiveness 0atransit time 0aturbulence velocity 0avertical slot fishway1 aQuaresma, Ana L.1 aSantos, José M.1 aBranco, Paulo1 aPinheiro, António N.0 tMarine & freshwater research.g2019, v. 70, no. 6 p.881-890dCSIRO PublishingwJournal:jnl3957320x1323-16507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/MF182323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02585naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001600188245015300204300001800357506007600375520106600451592002801517506003701545650002601582650000901608650001501617650001801632650002101650650002001671650001301691650004301704650001401747650001901761700002001780700002001800700001901820700001901839700002201858700001601880773014101896856008102037852000902118655001202127IND60550213920221207101031.0160909e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055021392DNAL7 a10.1007/s10068-016-0191-72doi7 aPMC60491292pmcid7 a302633952pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChoi, Dasom10aImprovement of Enterobacteriaceae enrichment broth by supplementation with sodium citrate for detection of Cronobacter sakazakii using real-time PCR  ap. 1205-1209.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aEnterobacteriaceae enrichment (EE) broth, a selective enrichment medium for Cronobacter sakazakii detection, has been shown to contain polymerase chain reaction (PCR) inhibitors. Therefore, a modified enrichment broth was developed, wherein possible PCR inhibitors, brilliant green and bile salts, were substituted with sodium citrate. Investigations were conducted to determine whether realtime PCR detection of C. sakazakii in powdered infant formula and dried vegetables with this modified medium improved compared with conventional culture methods. The detection rate of the modified EE broth was significantly higher (p<0.05) than that of the conventional EE broth for both types of food. For dried pumpkin samples, real-time PCR after culturing in modified EE broth yielded significantly higher detection rates and selectivity than those achieved using conventional culture in Druggan-Forsythe-Iversen agar. These results show that real-time PCR after enrichment in the modified EE broth may be an effective screening method for detection of C. sakazakii.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCronobacter sakazakii 3aagar 3abile salts 3aculture media 3adried vegetables 3ainfant formulas 3apumpkins 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3ascreening 3asodium citrate1 aChon, Jung-Whan1 aKim, Dong-Hyeon1 aKim, Hong-Seok1 aYim, Jin-Hyeok1 aSong, Kwang-Young1 aSeo, Kun-Ho0 tFood science and biotechnology.g2016 Aug., v. 25, no. 4 p.1205-1209dThe Korean Society of Food Science and Technologyx1226-77087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10068-016-0191-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03689naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006000148245017000208300001300378520184300391592002802234650001802262650002802280650001102308650002302319650001202342650002102354650001402375650003202389650001102421650001102432650001202443650001602455650001702471650001502488650002502503650001102528650002202539650003702561650002302598650001702621653003302638653002302671653001802694653002302712653002202735653002002757700005502777700002702832700002202859700001902881773011902900856008303019852000903102655001203111IND60772215020221119110553.0220809e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077221502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.sajb.2022.03.0512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAganchich, Badia1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6882-197010aEffect of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi inoculation on growth and physiology performance of olive trees under regulated deficit irrigation and partial rootzone drying  ap. 1-10.  aAgriculture water resources are limited in several Mediterranean regions. In this context, the current study was conducted to examine the response of mychorrizal olive plants to two water-saving irrigation techniques, namely partial-root zone drying (PRD) and regulated deficit irrigation (RDI). Young olive (Olea europaea L., cv Picholine marocaine) trees were grown with (+AMF) or without (-AMF) Rhizophagus irregularis using a split-root experiment, which consists in dividing the root system of the plant in two parts placed in separate pots. The pots were exposed simultaneously to three different water regimes: Control, with both root compartments well irrigated; RDI, with both compartments irrigated (50% of the control); and PRD, with one compartment irrigated (50% of the control), while the other compartment was kept dry switching every 10 days. Stomatal conductance (gs), leaf relative water content (RWC), vegetative growth (shoot length, total leaf area and leaf number), proline and sugar contents and leaf carbon isotope discrimination (δ13C) were measured in order to evaluate the influence of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis on the tolerance of the olive tree to water stress induced by RDI and PRD. The low soil moisture under this two water treatments have a negative effect on all studied parameters. However, the olive plants inoculated with the AM fungi (AMF) generally have significant great growth indices in comparison with the non-inoculated ones. Furthermore, at physiological (gs and RWC) and biochemical (proline, sugar and δ13C) level, +AMF olive plants exhibit better performance under drought than -AMF ones. These responses were mostly, earlier under PRD treatment. AM olive plants can tolerate better the water deficit stress of RDI and PRD treatments saving up to 50% of the irrigation water.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOlea europaea 3aRhizophagus irregularis 3acarbon 3adeficit irrigation 3adrought 3airrigation water 3aleaf area 3aleaf relative water content 3aleaves 3aolives 3aproline 3arhizosphere 3aroot systems 3asoil water 3astomatal conductance 3asugars 3avegetative growth 3avesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae 3awater conservation 3awater stress 0aArbuscular mycorrhizal fungi 0aDrought resilience 0aOlea europaea 0aOsmotic adjustment 0aVegetative growth 0aWater relations1 aWahbi, Said1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3066-55861 aYaakoubi, Abderrahmane1 aEl-Aououad, Hanan1 aBota, Josefina0 tSouth African journal of botany.g2022 Aug., v. 148 p.1-10dElsevier B.V.aSAABwJournal:jnl34108x0254-62997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sajb.2022.03.0513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02370naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002000144245008000164520122000244592002801464650002201492650001601514650001701530650001201547650001201559650001901571650000901590650002001599650001501619650001801634650003201652650002101684650000901705650001601714650001001730700002301740773012101763856007901884852000901963655001201972IND60781071820221122220538.0220623e20220620xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078107182DNAL7 a10.3390/plants111216152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRöhrig, Laura 10aDoes Abiotic Host Stress Favour Dothideomycete-Induced Disease Development?  aDothideomycetes represent one of the largest and diverse class of fungi. This class exhibits a wide diversity of lifestyles, including endophytic, saprophytic, pathogenic and parasitic organisms. Plant pathogenic fungi are particularly common within the Dothideomycetes and are primarily found within the orders of Pleosporales, Botryosphaeriales and Capnodiales. As many Dothideomycetes can infect crops used as staple foods around the world, such as rice, wheat, maize or banana, this class of fungi is highly relevant to food security. In the context of climate change, food security faces unprecedented pressure. The benefits of a more plant-based diet to both health and climate have long been established, therefore the demand for crop production is expected to increase. Further adding pressure on food security, both the prevalence of diseases caused by fungi and the yield losses associated with abiotic stresses on crops are forecast to increase in all climate change scenarios. Furthermore, abiotic stresses can greatly influence the outcome of the host-pathogen interaction. This review focuses on the impact of abiotic stresses on the host in the development of diseases caused by Dothideomycete fungi.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBotryosphaeriales 3aCapnodiales 3aPleosporales 3abananas 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3acorn 3acrop production 3aendophytes 3afood security 3ahost-pathogen relationships 3aplant-based diet 3arice 3asaprophytes 3awheat1 aDussart, Francois 0 tPlants.g2022 June 20, v. 11, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21620x2223-77477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants111216153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04295naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002500145245008000170300001800250520216600268592002802434596010202462596007902564596009102643650002302734650002502757650001502782650001202797650002302809650002502832650001202857650004102869650003202910650001402942650004002956650001902996650001003015650001403025650002403039653001103063653001103074653001703085653001803102653001003120700001703130700001803147700001803165700002003183700001603203700002803219700002303247700002403270700001503294700001903309700001503328700002203343700002203365700001303387773014503400856007903545852000903624655001203633IND60751193620221120075033.0210923e20160601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075119362DNAL7 a10.3945/ajcn.115.1243212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChandler, Paulette D10aLipid biomarkers and long-term risk of cancer in the Women’s Health Study  ap. 1397-1407.  aBackground: Lipid biomarkers, such as HDL-cholesterol concentrations, have been shown to have positive, inverse, and null associations with total, breast, and colorectal cancer risks. Studies of novel lipid biomarkers, such as apolipoprotein A-I (apo A-I) and apolipoprotein B-100 (apo B-100), and cancer risk have been sparse, to our knowledge. Objectives: We evaluated the prospective association of total, breast, colorectal, and lung cancers and cancer mortality with circulating lipid biomarkers in 15,602 female health professionals in the Women’s Health Study (aged ≥45 y, free of cardiovascular disease and cancer, and without hormone replacement therapy or lipid-lowering medications at baseline). Design: Cox regression models estimated HRs of cancer endpoints (19 y median follow-up) across quartiles 1 (reference) to 4 of each lipid biomarker after adjustment for cancer risk factors. Results: Confirmed cases included 2163 incident cancer cases (864 breast, 198 colorectal, and 190 lung cancers) and 647 cancer deaths. Total cancer risk was significantly lower in the highest quartile of apo A-I (adjusted HR: 0.79; 95% CI: 0.70, 0.90; P-trend = 0.0008) and HDL cholesterol (HR: 0.85; 95% CI: 0.75, 0.97; P-trend = 0.01). For site-specific cancers, significant associations included colorectal cancer risk with HDL cholesterol (HR: 0.63; 95% CI; 0.41, 0.98; P-trend = 0.03), triglycerides (HR: 1.86; 95% CI: 1.17, 2.97; P-trend = 0.02), and apo B-100 (HR: 1.60; 95% CI: 1.03, 2.49; P-trend = 0.006) and lung cancer risk with HDL cholesterol (HR: 0.59; 95% CI: 0.38, 0.93; P-trend = 0.01). LDL cholesterol was not significantly associated with risk of total cancer or any site-specific cancers. In time-dependent models that were adjusted for the use of a lipid-lowering medication after baseline, these associations remained. Conclusions: Lipids were associated with total, lung, and colorectal cancer risks in women. Lifestyle interventions for heart-disease prevention, which reduce apo B-100 or raise HDL cholesterol, may be associated with reduced cancer risk. The Women’s Health Study was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00000479.  aPublisher supplied data  aCA-047988aHL-043851aHL-080467aHL-099355aUM1 CA182913cNIHdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000002  aU01CA138962cNational Cancer Institutedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000054  a127524-MRSG-15-012-01-CNEcAmerican Cancer Societydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000048 3aapolipoprotein A-I 3aapolipoprotein B-100 3abiomarkers 3abreasts 3aclinical nutrition 3acolorectal neoplasms 3afemales 3ahigh density lipoprotein cholesterol 3ahormone replacement therapy 3alifestyle 3alow density lipoprotein cholesterol 3alung neoplasms 3alungs 3amortality 3aregression analysis 0acancer 0alipids 0ametabolomics 0atriglycerides 0awomen1 aSong, Yiqing1 aLin, Jennifer1 aZhang, Shumin1 aSesso, Howard D1 aMora, Samia1 aGiovannucci, Edward L.,1 aRexrode, Kathryn E1 aMoorthy, M Vinayaga1 aLi, Flora,1 aRidker, Paul M1 aLee, I-Min1 aManson, JoAnn E.,1 aBuring, Julie E.,1 aWang, Lu0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g2016 June 01, v. 103, no. 6 p.1397-1407dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl45206x1938-32077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.115.1243213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03637naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245014700167520199300314592002802307650001702335650002602352650001802378650001102396650002202407650001702429650002002446650002102466650003302487650002002520650001302540650004402553653002302597653002302620653001902643653001802662653001702680653002902697700001702726700001702743700001802760700001802778700001702796700001402813700001502827700001702842700001502859700001502874773011102889856008603000852000903086655001203095IND60767913320221121001821.0220328e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076791332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2022.1110212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXue, Guiren10aQuality control of Zingiberis Rhizoma and its processed products by UHPLC-Q-TOF/MS-based non-targeted metabonomics combining with SIBDV method  aZingiberis Rhizoma (ZR) is a homologous plant with pungent tastes and aromas, which has unique nutritional value and tremendous application potentiality. Zingiberis Rhizoma Praeparatum (ZRP) and Carbonised Ginger (CG) are processed products of ZR through different processing methods, and they are commonly used ingredients in food supplements. This study used ZR, ZRP and CG from different batches to further understand composition differences after processing. Additionally, we performed non-targeted metabolomics-based profiling of gingerols by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with hybrid triple quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-Q-TOF/MS) in combination with multivariate analysis and compounds identification. In which, we developed a comprehensive SWATH-IDA bi-directionally verified (SIBDV) method integrating the advantages of Sequential Windowed Acquisition of all Theoretical fragment ions (SWATHᵀᴹ) and traditional information-dependent acquisition (IDA) mode for characterization of gingerols. Potential chemical markers were selected by principal component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) of chemometrics methods. After that, the threshold variable importance in projection (VIP) value and P value were employed to screen the valuable MS features for discriminating ZR, ZRP and CG. In total, 59 gingerols in the different samples were structurally identified. Results allowed the selection of 33 gingerols, which are nominated as novel markers for materials authentication in ZR, ZRP and CG. The analysis of the study showed that the content of gingerols showed a downward trend after processing, but shogaols and gingerone compounds had an upward trend, resulting in differences in application and pharmacodynamic efficacy. These findings provide promising perspectives in the quality control of ZR, ZRP and CG, as well as for laying the foundation in food design and development.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemometrics 3adiscriminant analysis 3afood research 3aginger 3amass spectrometry 3ametabolomics 3anutritive value 3apharmacodynamics 3aprincipal component analysis 3aquality control 3arhizomes 3aultra-performance liquid chromatography 0aZingiberis Rhizoma 0aProcessed products 0aUHPLC-Q-TOF/MS 0aDifferentiate 0aMetabonomics 0aCompounds identification1 aSu, Shanshan1 aYan, Pengfei1 aShang, Jiawei1 aWang, Jianxin1 aYan, Chengye1 aLi, Jiaxi1 aWang, Qiao1 aDu, Yingfeng1 aCao, Liang1 aXu, Huijun0 tFood research international.g2022 Apr., v. 154 p.111021-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2022.1110213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02912naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245019800171300001600369520132600385592002801711650001301739650002001752650001701772650001001789650001101799650001601810650001801826650001101844650001801855650001201873650002001885650001701905653001801922653001201940653000801952653001301960653001901973653001701992653001302009700002602022700001802048700001902066700001802085700002102103700002002124700001902144700001602163773009802179856008402277852000902361655001202370IND60601136820221118054755.0180706e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060113682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.powtec.2014.03.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOlusanmi, Dolapo12aA control strategy for bioavailability enhancement by size reduction: Effect of micronization conditions on the bulk, surface and blending characteristics of an active pharmaceutical ingredient  ap. 222-233.  aIn a Quality by Design (QbD) development environment the effect of early process parameters on downstream manufacturing parameters, and the ultimate effect on drug product quality, need to be understood. For poorly soluble drugs, size reduction is frequently employed to obtain consistent in-vivo exposures. As a result, micronization is a key early stage processing step for many active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs).This paper demonstrates the effect of varying micronization conditions on an API for which micronization is deemed necessary to ensure consistent drug delivery after human administration. Material micronized to different extents are confirmed as different by surface area, surface energy, particle size analysis, bulk density and surface adhesion measurements.These material characteristics can be correlated with the outcomes from a key processing step, blending. The evolution of the blending process is followed using PAT techniques, so that an overall understanding of the relationship between particle properties and blend uniformity can be demonstrated.Execution of such a study during drug development can enable selection of the appropriate control strategy to ensure production of API in the desired range where consistent optimal bioavailability and downstream processability are achieved.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3abioavailability 3abulk density 3adrugs 3aenergy 3aingredients 3amanufacturing 3amixing 3aparticle size 3apowders 3aproduct quality 3asurface area 0aMicronization 0aMilling 0aQbD 0aBlending 0aSurface energy 0aSurface area 0aCohesion1 aJayawickrama, Dimuthu1 aBu, Dongsheng1 aMcGeorge, Gary1 aSailes, Helen1 aKelleher, Joanne1 aGamble, John F.1 aShah, Umang V.1 aTobyn, Mike0 tPowder technology.g2014 May, v. 258 p.222-233dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11732x0032-59107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2014.03.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02255naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245010400168300001600272520105800288592002801346650003301374650002401407650001401431650001201445650001401457650002001471650001501491650001101506653001801517653002401535653002201559653001201581653001001593700001301603700001201616700001501628773010601643856008701749852000901836655001201845IND60613579620221121151320.0200621e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061357962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2018.08.1142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Haiyuan10aNutrient recovery technologies integrated with energy recovery by waste biomass anaerobic digestion  ap. 520-531.  aAnaerobic digestion widely considered as a promising waste biomass disposal treatment approach, is attracting increasing interest in all corners of the globe. However, due to the specific features of different types of waste biomass, the bioenergy conversion efficiency of this process is not ideal. Another problematic aspect of anaerobic digestion is that the nutrient rich effluent sometimes needs to be treated before discharge. This review presents the recent achievements of waste biomass digestion from the perspective of energy recovery and nutrient recovery. In this work, the anaerobic treatment characteristics of common types of waste biomass are summarized and compared. With a focus of nutrient recovery and post treatment issues, the challenges and technical hurdles encountered in the anaerobic digestion of waste biomass are critically reviewed. Finally, an integrated system of anaerobic digestion, anaerobic ammonia oxidation (anammox) and phosphorus recovery is proposed for efficient energy and nutrient recovery from waste biomass.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanaerobic ammonium oxidation 3aanaerobic digestion 3abioenergy 3abiomass 3adigestion 3aenergy recovery 3aphosphorus 3awastes 0aWaste biomass 0aAnaerobic digestion 0aNutrient recovery 0aAnammox 0aAnMBR1 aGuo, Yan1 aQin, Yu1 aLi, Yu-You0 tBioresource technology.g2018 Dec., v. 269 p.520-531dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2018.08.1143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02912naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002800147245013200175300001800307520152800325592002801853650001901881650002201900650001401922650001701936650001601953650000901969650001001978650002201988650001602010650001202026650001302038650001202051650001402063650001702077650001602094650001602110650002102126700003102147700002602178700002302204700001802227773010702245856008102352852000902433655001202442IND60082568120221121063546.0141029e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008256812DNAL7 a10.1007/s11947-014-1359-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aColín-Chávez, Citlali14aThe Release of Carotenoids from a Light-Protected Antioxidant Active Packaging Designed to Improve the Stability of Soybean Oil  ap. 3504-3515.  aAn antioxidant active packaging was developed by coextruding two layers of high-density polyethylene (HDPE). Bags were made with the film in which the inner layer, designed to be in contact with food, contained marigold flower (Tagetes erecta) extract rich in carotenoids. The outer layer of the film was added with titanium dioxide (TiO₂) to decrease the effect of commercial lighting on the degradation of carotenoids. Four bilayer films were produced: added with TiO₂ and carotenoids, added with carotenoids, added with TiO₂, and with no additives at all (control film). Degradation of color and astaxanthin in the films was delayed by the addition of the TiO₂ when they were stored under commercial lighting at 25 °C. Bags made of these films produced an improvement on the soybean oil stability at 25 °C as a result of a synergic effect of light protection by TiO₂ and carotenoids release. This release was measured as diffusion coefficients of carotenoids from the films toward soybean oil at 10, 25, and 40 °C (2.10–19.26 × 10⁻¹¹ cm² s⁻¹) with activation energy of 53.66 kJ mol⁻¹. In conclusion, the combination of the two layers of HDPE added with TiO₂ and carotenoids introduced opacity and permitted to extend the active effect of the films in contact with soybean oil. Moreover, the effect of temperature on the diffusion of carotenoids showed that this new active packaging is able to exert its function in conditions of transport, storage, and commercialization of food.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTagetes erecta 3aactivation energy 3aadditives 3aantioxidants 3aastaxanthin 3abags 3acolor 3acommercialization 3adiffusivity 3aflowers 3alighting 3aopacity 3apackaging 3apolyethylene 3asoybean oil 3atemperature 3atitanium dioxide1 aVicente-Ramírez, Erick B.1 aSoto-Valdez, Herlinda1 aPeralta, Elizabeth1 aAuras, Rafael0 tFood and bioprocess technology.g2014 Dec., v. 7, no. 12 p.3504-3515dSpringer-Verlagx1935-51307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11947-014-1359-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02558naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001700188245012800205300001800333506007600351520111900427592002801546506003701574650003401611650001501645650003101660650001701691650001701708650003201725650001701757650003901774650001901813650001301832650001201845650001601857650003201873773014101905856008102046852000902127655001202136IND60550214120221207103653.0160909e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055021412DNAL7 a10.1007/s10068-016-0187-32doi7 aPMC60491192pmcid7 a302633912pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Ae-Jung10aOptimization of roasting conditions through antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities of Yak-kong (Rhynchosia nulubilis)  ap. 1175-1182.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe effects of roasting conditions on the antioxidant activities and anti-inflammatory activities of roasted yak-kong were investigated using a second-order central composite design. The optimum conditions for DPPH radical scavenging ability (IC₅₀), ABTS radical scavenging activity (IC₅₀), total phenolic content (TPC), and oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) were at 111.47°C for 20.45 min, with the best values (DPPH, IC₅₀; 2.143 mg/mL, ABTS, IC₅₀; 1.775 mg/mL, TPC; 51.39mg tannic acid (TAE)/g, and ORAC; 6.89 μmoL trolox equivalents (TE)/g). The optimum conditions of nitric oxide (NO) production, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) were at 110.24°C for 21.18 min, yielding the best values (NO; 14.484 μM, PGE2; 3.433 mg/mL, and TNF-α; 3.818 ng/mL). Superimposed contour plots with regard to 7 variables indicated that the optimum roasting temperature and time were 110.88°C and 20.86 min. This result suggested that the optimally roasted yak-kong could replace coffee beans to provide potential bone health benefits to heavy coffee drinkers.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aRhynchosia 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3aantioxidants 3acoffee beans 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3anitric oxide 3aoxygen radical absorbance capacity 3aprostaglandins 3aroasting 3atannins 3atemperature 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha0 tFood science and biotechnology.g2016 Aug., v. 25, no. 4 p.1175-1182dThe Korean Society of Food Science and Technologyx1226-77087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10068-016-0187-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03399naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005700139245011200196300001800308500002000326520160300346592002801949650001601977650002801993650001302021650001602034650001502050650002002065650000902085650002002094650002002114650003102134650001002165650001102175650002002186650001902206650001802225650001102243650001102254650001702265650001402282650001402296650002402310650003602334650002002370650002702390650001402417700004902431700001802480700001802498700001802516700001202534700001502546700001602561773012602577856007302703852000902776655001202785IND60596956720221116145150.0180622e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059695672DNAL7 a10.1111/jfd.127962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Qinghua1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6416-913410aDifferential transcriptome analysis of zebrafish (Danio rerio) larvae challenged by Vibrio parahaemolyticus  ap. 1049-1062.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aZebrafish embryo and larva represent a useful in vivo model for identification of host innate immune responses to bacterial infection. Vibrio parahaemolyticus is a typical zoonotic pathogen worldwide that causes acute gastroenteritis in humans and vibriosis in fishes. However, the mechanism of the innate immune response in the zebrafish larvae infected by V. parahaemolyticus has not been clear. We analysed the transcriptomic profile of 3 days post‐fertilization (dpf) zebrafish larvae immersed in V. parahaemolyticus 13 (Vp13) strain suspension for 2 hr. A total of 602 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in the infection group, of which 175 (29.07%) genes were upregulated and 427 (70.93%) genes were downregulated. These altered genes encoded complement and coagulation cascades, chemokine, TNF signalling pathway, NF‐κB signalling pathway and JAK‐STAT signalling pathway. Some significant DEGs, such as mmp13, cxcr4a, ccl20, hsp70, gngt, serpina1l, il8, cofilin and il11, were subjected to quantitative gene expression analysis, and the results were consistent with those of the transcriptome profile. These results clearly demonstrated that exposure to V. parahaemolyticus for 2 hr could activate innate immune response in 3dpf larvae by altered expression of downstream signalling pathway genes of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). Our results also provide a useful reference for future analysis of signal transduction pathways and pathogenesis mechanisms underlying the systemic innate immune response to the external bacteria of V. parahaemolyticus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDanio rerio 3aVibrio parahaemolyticus 3abacteria 3acoagulation 3acomplement 3aembryo (animal) 3afish 3agastroenteritis 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3ahumans 3ainnate immunity 3ainterleukin-11 3ainterleukin-8 3alarvae 3amodels 3apathogenesis 3apathogens 3areceptors 3asignal transduction 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 3atranscriptomics 3atumor necrosis factors 3avibriosis1 aJi, Ce1http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3739-14231 aRen, Jianfeng1 aZhang, Qiuyue1 aDong, Xuehong1 aZu, Yao1 aJia, Liang1 aLi, Weiming0 tJournal of fish diseases.g2018 July, v. 41, no. 7 p.1049-1062dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl10108x0140-77757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfd.127963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03055naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245012800167300001600295520161100311592002801922650001901950650002101969650002201990650001502012650002102027650001702048650001402065650002202079651002102101653002702122653002602149653003202175653002502207700001702232700001902249700001702268700002002285773023502305856008402540852000902624655001202633IND60570779020221118210016.0190411e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057077902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aspen.2017.06.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKwon, Deok Ho10aAnalysis of the molecular phylogenetics and genetic structure of an invasive alien species, Ricania shantungensis, in Korea  ap. 901-906.  aAn invasive alien species, Ricania shantungensis, has been spreading rapidly since it was first reported in Korea in 2010. Molecular phylogenetic analysis using two sets of nuclear and mitochondrial markers showed that the species was well grouped with the genus Ricania while it was clearly distinct from the genus Pochazia. We conducted haplotype analysis using a total of 215 samples collected from six provinces and found that the Korean populations were composed of eight haplotypes. The haplotype and nucleotide diversity of the samples were 0.544 and 0.005, respectively. The ‘Hap_1’ haplotype occurred at the highest frequency at approximately 65.6%. The genetic distance among the populations ranged from −0.049 to 0.93 and there was no apparent relationship with geographic distance (r2=0.083). The neutrality test detected no rapid population expansion, and a mismatch distribution analysis also supports this finding with a clear multimodal pattern. Instead, severe haplotype decline was detected in almost all of the local populations, which were composed of only 1–3 haplotypes, suggesting the existence of a founder effect. In our UPGMA phylogenetic tree construction, the 12 Korean populations were mainly grouped into four groups that had a significant FSC value (0.446, P<0.001) from AMOVA analysis. In summary, genetic difference was not associated with geographical distance and demographic equilibrium was found with severe haplotype decline. Further analysis is needed to trace its origin and dispersal route to establish a management system for invasive alien pests in Korea.  aPublisher supplied data 3afounder effect 3agenetic distance 3agenetic variation 3ahaplotypes 3ainvasive species 3amitochondria 3aphylogeny 3apopulation growth 3aKorean Peninsula 0aInvasive alien species 0aRicania shantungensis 0aPopulation genetic analysis 0aGenetic relationship1 aKim, Se-jin,1 aKang, Taek-Jun1 aLee, Jang Ho1 aKim, Dong-Hwan,0 tJournal of Asia-Pacific entomology.g2017 Sept., v. 20, no. 3 p.901-906dElsevier B.V.aKorean Society of Applied Entomology, Taiwan Entomological Society and Malaysian Plant Protection SocietywJournal:jnl4413786x1226-86157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aspen.2017.06.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03349naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001900144245012900163300002000292520170200312592002802014650002802042650002102070650001502091650001602106650002202122650001102144650001302155650001802168650001002186650001802196650001702214650001502231650001602246653002602262653005102288653003502339653002902374653004102403700001902444700001902463700001502482700001902497700001502516700001602531700005402547773014202601856007902743852000902822655001202831IND60756073320221117225135.0211110e20211026xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075607332DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.1c147772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhong, Weibing10aFull-Textile Human Motion Detection Systems Integrated by Facile Weaving with Hierarchical Core–Shell Piezoresistive Yarns  ap. 52901-52911.  aThe tremendous progress of the wearable intelligent system has brought an urgent demand for flexible pressure sensors, especially for those possessing high sensing performances, simple manufacture technology, and efficient integration. In this work, hierarchical core–shell piezoresistive yarns (HCPYs), which contain internal silver-plated nylon electrodes and surface microporous structured carbon nanotubes (CNTs)/thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) sensing layer, are designed and manufactured via facile wet-spinning accompanied by a water vapor coagulating bath. The obtained HCPY can either be inserted into traditional textiles to assemble a single-pressure sensor, or be woven into a textile-based flexible pressure sensors array with expected size and resolution, without compromising their comfort, breathability, and three-dimensional (3D) conformability. Simultaneously, to further enhance the sensing performance, the surface microporous structures of HCPYs are optimized by altering the treatment humidity and exposure time during the process of water vapor-induced phase separation. The wearable pressure sensors assembled by the optimal HCPY achieved a high sensitivity up to 84.5 N–¹, a good durability over 5000-cycle tests, a fast response time of 2.1 ms, and a recovery time of 2.4 ms. Moreover, the wearable pressure sensors have been successfully used to monitor physical signals and human motions. The textile-based flexible pressure sensors array has also been seamlessly integrated with sportswear to detect movements of the elbow joint and map spatial pressure distribution, which makes HCPY a promising candidate for constructing next-generation wearable electronics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aartificial intelligence 3acarbon nanotubes 3adurability 3aelectronics 3aexposure duration 3ahumans 3ahumidity 3amanufacturing 3anylon 3apolyurethanes 3aporous media 3aseparation 3awater vapor 0amodified wet-spinning 0ahierarchical core–shell piezoresistive yarns 0asurface microporous structures 0awearable pressure sensor 0atextile-based pressure sensors array1 aMing, Xiaojuan1 aJiang, Haiqing1 aKe, Yiming1 aDing, Xincheng1 aLi, Mufang1 aJia, Kangyu1 aWang, Dong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8139-85020 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2021 Oct. 26, v. 13, no. 44 p.52901-52911dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.1c147773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01247naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245006900158300001800227520023200245592002800477650002300505650002700528650002300555650002400578650001400602700002100616700002200637700002700659700001800686773013300704856007500837852000900912655001200921IND60658797820221119085654.0190826e20101109xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065879782DNAL7 a10.1039/c0cc03229h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJin, Jianfeng10aMhyADH catalysed Michael addition of water and in situ oxidation  ap. 8588-8590.  aThe Michael addition of water is a major challenge.

Planning effective placement of hybrid poplar based biorefinery facilities takes tremendous time and financial resources. A hybrid poplar based biorefinery siting application (HP-BiSWA), a web-enabled refinery siting application, was developed so that potential stakeholders may quickly assess available resources at selected locations and provide information relating to the economic competitiveness and financial risks associated with construction and operation. At present, the tool supports evaluation of the potential for hybrid poplar based jet fuel and acetic acid production based on user-specified conditions. The application is generally expandable to other feedstock, technology, and product types. HP-BiSWA uses various modules (i.e. 3PG-crop growth model and farm budget application) and services (i.e. parcel service, transportation routing service, crop service, soil and weather services) to retrieve and estimate information to optimize and select potential parcels for poplar cultivation, and ultimately determine net revenue for biofuel production under selected decision options.To demonstrate the utility of HP-BiSWA, a case study analysis was performed for Centralia, WA based on a 380 ML/yr (100 MGY) jet fuel biorefinery using two scenarios: (1) a 175 km feedstock supply radius with 50% pastureland use, and (2) a 225 km feedstock supply radius with 25% pastureland use. The case study captures the interactive effects on biorefinery performance with changes in feedstock supply area and available water, power, and other resources for operation of the biorefinery.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3aPopulus 3aacetic acid 3abiobased products 3abioenergy 3abiorefining 3acase studies 3afarm budgets 3afeedstocks 3afuel production 3afuels 3agrowth models 3aincome 3apastures 3aplanning 3arisk 3asoil 3astakeholders 3aweather 3aWashington (state)1 aBandaru, Varaprasad1 aHart, Quinn1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9829-89141 aParker, Nathan1 aJenkins, Bryan M.0 tComputers and electronics in agriculture.g2018 Dec., v. 155 p.76-83dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl38096x0168-16997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compag.2018.09.0423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02363naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245009200157300002000249520108400269592002801353650001101381650002001392650002601412650002101438650001401459650001901473650001601492700001901508700001501527700001801542700001401560700001501574700001901589700001701608700001801625700001801643700001701661700001201678700001901690773012501709856007401834852000901908655001201917IND60669469420221119053525.0190920e20151119xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066946942DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra20688j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Shanming10aEnhancement of the thermoelectric properties of MnSb₂Se₄ through Cu resonant doping  ap. 99065-99073.  aMnSb₂Se₄ is a narrow band semiconductor having large Seebeck coefficients and intrinsically low thermal conductivities, but modest thermoelectric zT values due to having low carrier concentrations and high electrical resistivity. Here, we report that Cu substituted Mn₁₋ₓCuₓSb₂Se₄ (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.35) materials display resonant doping behavior, leading to significantly enhanced power factors (PFs) and overall thermoelectric zT values in the measured temperature range. For the optimized composition Mn₀.₇₅Cu₀.₂₅Sb₂Se₄, the PF reaches 0.26 mW m⁻¹ K⁻² at 773 K, coupled with low thermal conductivities of 0.61 W K⁻¹ m⁻¹ to 0.32 W K⁻¹ m⁻¹ over the measured temperature range. A peak zT of 0.64 at 773 K is achieved, which is a 100% increase in comparison to undoped MnSb₂Se₄. Such a high zT has rarely been seen in thermoelectric materials with a low symmetry of crystallization, implying that Cu-doped MnSb₂Se₄ could be considered as a new platform in thermoelectric research for intermediate temperature power generation.  aPublisher supplied data 3acopper 3acrystallization 3aelectrical resistance 3apower generation 3aselenides 3asemiconductors 3atemperature1 aZhao, Huaizhou1 aZhang, Han1 aRen, Guangkun1 aLiu, Ning1 aLi, Dandan1 aYang, Chuansen1 aJin, Shifeng1 aShang, Dashan1 aWang, Wenhong1 aLin, Yuanhua1 aGu, Lin1 aChen, Xiaolong0 tRSC advances.g2015 Nov. 19, v. 5, no. 120 p.99065-99073dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra20688j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02653naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245010700165246010200272300001600374520128000390592002801670650001601698650002101714650002601735650001501761650002101776650002601797650002301823650001801846650003101864650001101895650000901906650001701915650001901932700002301951700002601974700002002000700002402020773011802044856004802162852000902210655001202219IND4469478620221121183449.0120815e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446947862DNAL7 a10.1007/s00107-011-0590-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRassam, Ghonche10aMechanische Eigenschaften und Dimensionsstabilität von mit Nanosilber imprägniertem Fichtenpressholz3 aMechanical performance and dimensional stability of nano-silver impregnated densified spruce wood  ap. 595-600.  aThe aim of this study was to investigate the effect of nano-silver treatment on some physical and mechanical properties of compressed low density wood species. Wood specimens were prepared from spruce (Picea abies), impregnated with water or nano-silver solution by empty cell process and compressed through radial direction in a hot press. The results showed that by nano-silver treatment, the spring back, bending strength (modulus of rupture) and impact load resistance were improved significantly. The best results for spring-back (0.04%) were seen in the nano-silver impregnated specimens that were compressed at 150°C for 4 hours. The modulus of rupture (MOR), modulus of elasticity (MOE) and impact load resistance in nano-silver impregnated densified specimens were gained for 53%, 41.2% and 175.7%, respectively (in comparison with controls). The maximum amounts of impact load resistance belonged to the nano-silver impregnated specimens which were compressed at press conditions of 150°C for 4 hours, showing the high ability of these specimens against high impact loads such as earthquake loads. An upcoming research (consisting of durability tests) will be done for evaluating the suitability of nano-silver impregnated densified spruce wood for exterior uses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPicea abies 3abending strength 3adimensional stability 3adurability 3amechanical loads 3amodulus of elasticity 3amodulus of rupture 3ananoparticles 3aphysicochemical properties 3asilver 3awood 3awood density 3awood treatment1 aGhofrani, Mohammad1 aTaghiyari, Hamid Reza1 aJamnani, Behnam1 aKhajeh, Mohamad Ali0 tEuropean Journal of Wood and Wood Products.g2012 Sept., v. 70, no. 5 p.595-600dSpringer-Verlagx0018-37687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00107-011-0590-7  aDNAL 7aarticle02779naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002300149245012000172300001600292520148000308592002801788650001201816650001701828650002701845650002201872650001701894650002201911650001001933650001101943650002101954650002901975650002802004653002102032653002402053653001502077653002002092653002002112653001102132700001702143773009302160856008302253852000902336655001202345IND60606896920221120222905.0180730e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060689692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2015.11.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWesseh, Presley K.10aOutput and substitution elasticities of energy and implications for renewable energy expansion in the ECOWAS region  ap. 125-137.  aThis study estimates output and substitution elasticities of renewable energy and nonrenewable energy for the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and discusses implications for expanding the former. The results show that nonrenewable energy promises greater benefits for ECOWAS economic transition, with output elasticities averaging between 0.052–0.579 and −0.055 to 0.223 for nonrenewable energy and renewable energy respectively. Overall estimated technological progress is low (−0.5% to 2.6%); the bulk coming from input efficiency. Substitution elasticities (0.02–0.94) suggest potential for switching towards renewable energy. Notwithstanding, scale, economics and sitting problems inherent in renewable power generation challenge the opportunities for energy substitution. A sustainable policy solution, therefore, appears to be one favoring scaled and efficient electricity generation from fossil energy in the short-run with a gradual switch towards renewable power in the long-run. In general, the applied model provides insights that energy efficiency enhances sustainable growth by propelling technological advancement especially when technical change is scale-biased and factor-augmenting. The study also provides insights that impacts of exogenous shocks to inputs are temporary, and hence, do not jeopardize efforts aimed at scaling output through increased and efficient use of labor, capital and energy; especially nonrenewable energy.  aPublisher supplied data 3acapital 3aelasticities 3aelectricity generation 3aenergy efficiency 3afossil fuels 3aissues and policy 3alabor 3amodels 3apower generation 3arenewable energy sources 3asustainable development 0aRenewable energy 0aNonrenewable energy 0aMitigation 0aEnergy security 0aEconomic growth 0aECOWAS1 aLin, Boqiang0 tEnergy policy.g2016 Feb., v. 89 p.125-137dElsevier LtdwJournal:12439x0301-42157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2015.11.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03264naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002900150245010300179300001600282520169000298592002801988650001802016650002402034650002302058650002702081650002702108650002302135650001202158650002702170650001802197650001202215650001402227650002402241650001402265650002102279653002702300653001802327653002402345653002702369653001402396653002602410700001602436700001602452700002302468700002302491700002902514773011002543856008402653852000902737655001202746IND60122033020221118232122.0150324e20150504xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012203302DNAL7 a10.1080/09583157.2014.9898132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGreenfield, Bethany P.J.10aIdentification of Metarhizium strains highly efficacious against Aedes, Anopheles and Culex larvae  ap. 487-502.  aEntomopathogenic fungi, such as Metarhizium anisopliae and Beauveria bassiana, have been shown to be efficacious in killing mosquito larvae of different mosquito species. The current study compared the pathogenicity and efficacy of two formulations of three fungal strains against different instars of three mosquito species with the aim of identifying the most virulent strain for use under field conditions. Three strains of Metarhizium , ARESF 4556, ARSEF 3297 and V275, were assayed against early (L ₂₋₃) and late (L ₃–₄) instar larvae of Aedes aegypti , Anopheles stephensi and Culex quinquefasciatus . Two formulations of the fungi were tested, dry conidia and aqueous suspensions (i.e. ‘wet’ conidia). Effects of all combinations of conidia, mosquito species, instar, fungal strain and concentration on mosquito mortality were analysed using Cox regression and Kaplan–Meier analyses. Strain ARSEF 4556 was more virulent than ARSEF 3297 and V275, with LT ₅₀ values ranging from 0.3 to 1.1 days, with Anopheles and Culex being more susceptible than Aedes . Early and late instars were equally susceptible independent of species. Although the formulation did influence mortality rates, both ‘wet’ and ‘dry’ conidia applications were highly effective in killing mosquito larvae. Viable spores were more efficacious than heat killed spores. The latter did cause mortality but only at high concentrations. Metarhizium sp . has proved to be effective in reducing survivability of all larval stages of Aedes , Anopheles and Culex under laboratory conditions. Aedes larvae were generally more tolerant than Anopheles and Culex irrespective of fungal strain.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAedes aegypti 3aAnopheles stephensi 3aBeauveria bassiana 3aCulex quinquefasciatus 3aMetarhizium anisopliae 3abiological control 3aconidia 3aentomopathogenic fungi 3ainsect larvae 3ainstars 3amortality 3aregression analysis 3avirulence 3avirulent strains 0aMetarhizium anisopliae 0aAedes aegypti 0aAnopheles stephensi 0aCulex quinquefasciatus 0atolerance 0alarval susceptibility1 aPeace, Andy1 aEvans, Hugh1 aDudley, Edward J.,1 aAnsari, Minshad A.1 aButt, T.

Planning and decision support frameworks are designed to help conservation practitioners increase planning rigor, project accountability, stakeholder participation, transparency in decisions, and learning. We describe and contrast five common frameworks within the context of six fundamental questions (why, who, what, where, when, how) at each of three planning stages of adaptive management (project scoping, operational planning, learning). We demonstrate that decision support frameworks provide varied and extensive tools for conservation planning and management. However, using any framework in isolation risks diminishing potential benefits since no one framework covers the full spectrum of potential conservation planning and decision challenges. We describe two case studies that have effectively deployed tools from across conservation frameworks to improve conservation actions and outcomes. Attention to the critical questions for conservation project planning should allow practitioners to operate within any framework and adapt tools to suit their specific management context. We call on conservation researchers and practitioners to regularly use decision support tools as standard practice for framing both practice and research.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaccountability 3aadaptive management 3acase studies 3adecision support systems 3alearning 3aplanning 3arisk 3astakeholders1 aCook, Carly N.1 aPressey, Robert L.1 aPullin, Andrew S.1 aRunge, Michael C.1 aSalafsky, Nick1 aSutherland, William J.1 aWilliamson, Matthew A.0 tConservation letters.g2018 Mar., v. 11, no. 2 p.e12385-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:J000000138x1755-263X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/conl.123853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03734naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001900171245010400190300001600294520164500310592002801955650001601983650002901999650003802028650002702066650001202093650002002105650001702125650001902142650000902161650002002170650001502190650002202205650003902227650002602266650003502292650003502327650003902362650002702401650003002428650002902458650003702487650002402524650005202548650002002600650003302620650003902653650003302692650003102725650001502756700001702771700002002788700002102808700002202829700002102851700001702872700002202889773009702911856005503008852000903063655001203072IND4478409420221119164849.0120727e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447840942DNAL7 a219107702pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-313X.2011.04780.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKrebs, Melanie10aFRET‐based genetically encoded sensors allow high‐resolution live cell imaging of Ca2+ dynamics  ap. 181-192.  aTemporally and spatially defined calcium signatures are integral parts of numerous signalling pathways. Monitoring calcium dynamics with high spatial and temporal resolution is therefore critically important to understand how this ubiquitous second messenger can control diverse cellular responses. Yellow cameleons (YCs) are fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)‐based genetically encoded Ca2+ ‐sensors that provide a powerful tool to monitor the spatio‐temporal dynamics of Ca2+ fluxes. Here we present an advanced set of vectors and transgenic lines for live cell Ca2+ imaging in plants. Transgene silencing mediated by the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter has severely limited the application of nanosensors for ions and metabolites and we have thus used the UBQ10 promoter from Arabidopsis and show here that this results in constitutive and stable expression of YCs in transgenic plants. To improve the spatial resolution, our vector repertoire includes versions of YCs that can be targeted to defined locations. Using this toolkit, we identified temporally distinct responses to external ATP at the plasma membrane, in the cytosol and in the nucleus of neighbouring root cells. Moreover analysis of Ca2+ dynamics in Lotus japonicus revealed distinct Nod factor induced Ca2+ spiking patterns in the nucleus and the cytosol. Consequently, the constructs and transgenic lines introduced here enable a detailed analysis of Ca2+ dynamics in different cellular compartments and in different plant species and will foster novel approaches to decipher the temporal and spatial characteristics of calcium signatures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3aCauliflower mosaic virus 3aLotus corniculatus var. japonicus 3aadenosine triphosphate 3acalcium 3aenergy transfer 3afluorescence 3aimage analysis 3aions 3aplasma membrane 3atransgenes 3atransgenic plants 2aAdenosine Triphosphatexmetabolism 2aArabidopsisxgenetics 2aBiosensing Techniquesxmethods 2aCalciumxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aCalcium-Binding Proteinsxanalysis 2aCaulimovirusxgenetics 2aCell Membranexmetabolism 2aCell Nucleusxmetabolism 2aCotyledonxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCytosolxmetabolism 2aFluorescence Resonance Energy Transferxmethods 2aGenetic Vectors 2aLotusxcytologyxmetabolism. 2aPlant Rootsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlants, Genetically Modified 2aPromoter Regions, Genetic. 2aTransgenes1 aHeld, Katrin1 aBinder, Andreas1 aHashimoto, Kenji1 aDen Herder, Griet1 aParniske, Martin1 aKudla, Jörg1 aSchumacher, Karin0 tplant journal.g2012 Jan., v. 69, no. 1 p.181-192dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0960-74127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-313X.2011.04780.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02352naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100002000156245012400176300001600300520105300316592002801369650002301397650002401420650002201444650002301466650002001489650002701509650001901536650002601555650001401581650001201595650000801607650001101615650001301626650001101639650001201650650001201662650001401674650001201688651001301700700001601713773009901729856005701828852000901885655001201894IND50085910820221118050107.0140412e198403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008591082DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-3059.1984.tb00594.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChannon, A.

The preliminary survey in 1979 showed that the disease was present in approximately half of the fields in the area. A quantitative survey of 24 fields in 1980 revealed the disease in 71% of these fields at densities between 100 and 380,000 symptom‐bearing tillers per hectare. Most disease was found in ryegrass, but occasionally diseased plants of cocksfoot (Dactylis glomerata) and timothy (Phleum pratense) were found. Tall and meadow fescue (Festuca arundinacea and F. pratensis) were also susceptible to infection in the laboratory (cut leaf and root dip inoculations). Ryegrass cultivars varied in their susceptibility to laboratory inoculation. Cultures of Xanthomanas campestris pv graminis showed no loss of virulence following freeze‐drying and revival.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDactylis glomerata 3aFestuca arundinacea 3aFestuca pratensis 3aLolium multiflorum 3aPhleum pratense 3aXanthomonas campestris 3abacterial wilt 3abiological resistance 3acultivars 3agrasses 3ahay 3aleaves 3apastures 3asilage 3asurveys 3atillers 3avirulence 3awilting 3aScotland1 aHISSETT, R.0 tPlant pathology.g1984 Mar., v. 33, no. 1 p.113-121dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0032-08627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3059.1984.tb00594.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02856naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245012600167300001600293520141500309592002801724650001401752650002501766650001301791650001601804650003701820650001301857650001301870650003301883650001201916650002001928650001601948650000901964653001901973653003001992653002502022653001902047700001902066700001702085700001902102700001302121700001802134700001602152773011202168856008502280852000902365655001202374IND60570311920221122000019.0180830e20171101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057031192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.memsci.2017.06.0682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRuan, Xuehua10aEnhancing mechanical stability and uniformity of 2-D continuous ZIF-8 membranes by Zn(II)-doped polydopamine modification  ap. 101-107.  aZeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) with regular pore size (~ 0.34nm) is widely attempted for gas separation membranes based on size sieving. However, the prospect is subjected to fabricating the continuous ZIF-8 membranes with high mechanical stability and uniformity. In response, an adhesive layer of Zn(II)-doped polydopamine (Zn-PDA) is pre-coated on the stainless steel nets in this work to improve ZIF-8 nucleation and growth. Zn-PDA layer shows high tolerance to ultrasonic agitation and heated methanol (system for ZIF-8 synthesis), little dissolution within 24h, which supplies a high stable surface for ZIF-8 growth. Furthermore, the Zn(II) doped in PDA layer is opportunely serving as the even-distributed ZIF-8 nucleation starting sites, verified with the EDX and FE-SEM images for the aggregated Zn(II) clusters and the nascent ZIF-8 crystals. Therefore, an indented and hinged boundary is constructed between ZIF-8 and substrate to enhance the mechanical stability. The FE-SEM images after ultrasonic agitation show that the continuous ZIF-8 membranes prepared on Zn-PDA layers can tolerate the deformation to a certain extent. Finally, the prepared ZIF-8 membranes behave excellently with αH2/CO2 = 9.9, αH2/CO = 17.2, αH2/CH4 = 26.0, and permeation rate JH2 = 3980 GPU. This work supplied a useful approach to enhance mechanical stability and uniformity of defect-free ZIF-8 membranes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagitation 3aartificial membranes 3acrystals 3adeformation 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3amethanol 3aporosity 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asieving 3astainless steel 3aultrasonics 3azinc 0aZIF-8 membrane 0aZn(II)-doped polydopamine 0aMechanical stability 0aGas separation1 aZhang, Xinfang1 aLiao, Xuhang1 aJiang, Xiaobin1 aDai, Yan1 aYan, Xiaoming1 aHe, Gaohong0 tJournal of membrane science.g2017 Nov. 01, v. 541 p.101-107dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12468x0376-73887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2017.06.0683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01937naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245012000166300001600286520071300302592002801015650001801043650001201061650002701073650000901100650001401109650001401123650002001137650003201157650002001189650002601209650001501235650001101250650001101261650000901272700001901281700002401300773011301324856008101437852000901518655001201527IND50089269820221118102051.0150214e200508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008926982DNAL7 a10.1007/s00217-005-1191-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aÖzogul, Yesim10aFatty acid profile and mineral content of the wild snail (Helix pomatia) from the region of the south of the Turkey  ap. 547-549.  aThe fatty acid and mineral compositions in the flesh of wild snail (Helix pomatia) collected in the region of Cukurova in Turkey were evaluated.

The implanted soil mass technique was utilized to investigate the influence of subsurface amendments on root systems. It consisted of mixing a study soil with chemical treatments of interest, burying the mixture in mesh bags 15 cm below an existing alfalfa stand, removing the bags after 1 yr, and determining root mass and N₂ fixation via acetylene reduction. A Tatum clay loam (clayey, mixed, thermic Typic Hapludult) soil with an initial pH of 4.4 and amended with either CaSO₄, NH₄NO₃, CaSO₄, + NH₄NO₃, KOH, or Ca(OH)₂ was buried in the mesh bags, in an Ernest silt loam (fine-loamy, mixed, mesic Aquic Fragidult) that had received either 0 or 6.7 Mg ha⁻¹ of surface-applied dolomitic limestone. After liming, the pH of the soil surface (0–5 cm) increased from 5.3 to 6.3. Surface liming increased the root mass in only the implanted soil mass receiving a Ca(OH)₂ or KOH amendment and did so by 7.5- and fivefold, respectively. With the unlimed soil, only Ca(OH)₂ increased root mass in the implanted soil mass. With the exception of Ca(OH)₂, treatments had no influence on N₂ fixation in the implanted soil mass. For the Ca(OH)₂ amendment there was a fourfold increase in N₂ fixation in the surface-limed soil and a 20-fold increase in the unlimed soil.  aPublisher supplied data 3anitrogen fixation 3aliming 3anitrogen 3acalcium 3aclay loam soils 3aMedicago sativa 3asoil amendments 3aacetylene 3asoil pH 3aroots 3aVirginia 0areduction1 aEdmisten, K.

Here, we synthesized a series of hydrophobic associated hydrogels (HA-gels) through micellar copolymerization in sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) aqueous solution. The hydrophobic monomer used is fatty alcohol polyoxyethylene acrylate (AEO-AC), which is significantly more eco-friendly than the traditional octylphenol polyoxyethylene acrylate (OP-AC) hydrophobic monomer. Interestingly, the mechanical properties of HA-gels can be tuned controllably by varying the ratio of AEO-AC-10-5 to AEO-AC-13-5 (AEO-AC-n-5: CₙH₂ₙ₊₁(OCH₂CH₂)₅O–C(O)CHCH₂; n = 10, 13). The longer and sheer straight carbon chain of AEO-AC-13-5 leads to stronger hydrophobic association point, while the shorter and branched carbon chain of AEO-AC-10-5 results in weaker hydrophobic association point. The resulting AEO-AC-13-5-AM gels possess tough mechanical strength (maximum broken stress is 318 kPa) and high elongation (1000–3000%). Then, we could tune the swelling and stress relaxation behaviors by varying the ratio of SDS to AEO-AC and obtain HA-gels that maintain their shapes in water nearly half a year, with low content of SDS. Lastly, our HA-gels also exhibit good self-healing capability, and offer great opportunities for a lot of prospective biomaterials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaqueous solutions 3abiocompatible materials 3abioremediation 3acarbon 3acopolymerization 3ahydrogels 3ahydrophobicity 3aoctylphenols 3apolyethylene glycol 3asodium dodecyl sulfate 3astrength (mechanics) 3astress relaxation1 aNiu, N.1 aLiu, Y.

The development of methods to screen genotypes for a variety of responses to combinations of environmental and management scenarios will allow breeders and farmers to make better use of the genetic potential of genotypes. The objectives of this study were to determine the impact of the genotype, environment, crop management and their interactions on the yield and grain quality traits of 15 spring wheat genotypes evaluated across 7 locations at 2 crop management levels and evaluate the impact of considered effects in two groups of environments with favourable and unfavourable soil conditions for spring wheat growth. The yield and test weight of spring wheat were highly influenced by environmental effects. At the same time, the variation of quality traits especially those associated with the quantity and quality of grain protein was substantially influenced by crop management and genotype. Therefore, much lower influence of genotype and crop management on most of the studied traits was observed in the group of environments with unfavourable soil conditions than in those with favourable soil conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrop management 3afarmers 3agenotype 3agenotype-environment interaction 3agrain protein 3agrain quality 3agrain yield 3asoil 3aspring wheat 0aCrop managements 0aEnvironmental condition 0aQuality 0aSpring wheat 0aCV 0aF 0aG 0aGPC 0aGY 0aHIM 0aL 0aM 0aMIM 0aNG/S 0aNS 0aNIR 0aSC 0aSV 0aTGW 0aTW 0aU 0aWGC 0aY1 aWijata, Magdalena1 aSobczyński, Grzegorz1 aSamborski, Stanisław1 aGozdowski, Dariusz1 aRozbicki, Jan0 tJournal of cereal science.g2016 Nov., v. 72 p.30-37dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46803x0733-52107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcs.2016.09.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02204naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245009200167300001800259520090100277592002801178650001901206650001401225650002401239650001201263650001301275650001601288650001401304653000801318653002401326653004101350653002201391653002601413700001601439700005601455700005801511773014301569856008501712852000901797655001201806IND60627079220221117013041.0190128e20181115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062707922DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.8b048582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYan, Tongan10aScreening and Design of Covalent Organic Framework Membranes for CO₂/CH₄ Separation  ap. 1220-1227.  aMembrane based CO₂/CH₄ separation is an effective and energy saving way for highly demanded natural gas upgrading. Herein, high-throughput computational screening of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) for CO₂/CH₄ membrane separation is realized by using the 298 COF structures in CoRE COF database. Based on the study of structure–performance relationships, structural features of the outperformed COFs were identified and classified, followed by the structural design by decorating 11 CoRE COFs with 10 kinds of familiar functional groups. By evaluating the 290 designed COFs as membrane materials, the effectiveness and universality of −F and −Cl groups in improving the performance of various COFs were identified. The well-performed COFs were also computationally evaluated as fillers to make COF@polymer mixed matrix membranes, and improved separation performance was obtained.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3adatabases 3aenergy conservation 3amethane 3amoieties 3anatural gas 3ascreening 0aCOF 0aMembrane separation 0aStructure−performance relationship 0aFunctionalization 0aMolecular simulations1 aLan, Youshi1 aTong, Minman1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9357-56841 aZhong, Chongli1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7921-99230 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2018 Nov. 15, v. 7, no. 1 p.1220-1227dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.8b048583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04250naa a2201153 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100003900152245018000191520097000371592002801341650003401369650001701403650002501420650001001445650001901455650002301474650001401497650001001511650001801521650001601539650001101555650002001566650000901586650001801595650001001613653000701623653000701630653000701637653000701644653000701651653000601658653000601664653000601670653000601676653000601682653000601688653001001694653001001704653001401714653001101728653001201739653001201751653001201763653000601775653000601781653001101787653001001798653000801808653000901816653002101825653000701846653000901853653000801862653000801870653000701878653000901885653000801894653000801902653001101910653000801921653000701929653001001936653000901946653005001955653005602005653005402061653005302115653003602168653005002204653005002254653006502304653004802369653004802417653002202465653001002487653002002497653002302517653001702540653001402557653003702571653002502608700004402633700002702677700002302704700003202727700002602759700001702785700002302802700003302825700003002858773010002888856008702988852000903075655001203084IND60647497320221121015926.0190726e20191115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064749732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2019.1249712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaria de Carvalho Tavares, Iasnaia10aBRS Violeta (BRS Rúbea × IAC 1398-21) grape juice powder produced by foam mat drying.

It was used as raw material for the production of juice and dehydrated products using foam mat drying at 60, 70 and 80 °C and freeze drying (control). HLPC-DAD-ESI-MSn allowed the evaluation of the quantitative and qualitative changes of the main PCs (anthocyanins, flavonols and hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives (HCAD)) present in the grapes during the processing. The use of the steam extraction method to obtain grape juice allowed a greater extraction of flavonols and, mainly derivatives of hydroxycinnamic acids, when compared with anthocyanins. Drying at 70 °C was the most suitable for the preservation of the PCs and, at the same time, for the reduction of the processing time. The powdered products presented considerable concentrations of total PCs (3–5 mg/g) and antioxidant activity (32–79 (DPPH) or 17–27 (FRAP) mg/g).  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aanthocyanins 3aantioxidant activity 3acolor 3acoumaric acids 3adrying temperature 3aflavonols 3afoams 3afreeze drying 3agrape juice 3agrapes 3aprocessing time 3apulp 3araw materials 3asteam 0adp 0acy 0apt 0apn 0amv 0aM 0aQ 0aK 0aL 0aI 0aS 0a3-gal 0a3-glc 0a3,5-diglc 0a3-glcU 0a3-acglc 0a3-cfglc 0a3-cmglc 0ac 0at 0a3-pent 0a3-rhm 0aGRP 0aHCAD 0aHLPC-DAD-ESI-MSn 0aAA 0aDPPH 0aGAE 0aFMD 0aFS 0aFRAP 0aPCs 0aTPC 0aTrolox 0aTSS 0aTA 0aANOVA 0aAOAC 0aDelphinidin 3-glucoside (PubChem CID: 443650) 0aDelphinidin 3,5-diglucoside (PubChem CID: 10100906) 0aPetunidin 3,5-diglucoside (PubChem CID: 10151874) 0aMalvidin 3,5-diglucoside (PubChem CID: 44256978) 0aMyricetin (PubChem CID:5281672) 0aMyricetin 3-glucoside (PubChem CID: 44259426) 0aQuercetin 3-glucoside (PubChem CID: 44259229) 0a2-S-glutathionyl-trans-caftaric acid (PubChem CID: 71308212) 0atrans-caftaric acid (PubChem CID: 13887348) 0atrans-fertaric acid (PubChem CID: 72551457) 0aBRS Violeta grape 0aJuice 0aFoam mat drying 0aPhenolic compounds 0aAnthocyanins 0aFlavonols 0aHydroxycinnamic acid derivatives 0aAntioxidant activity1 aBonatto Machado de Castilhos, Maurício1 aAparecida Mauro, Maria1 aMota Ramos, Afonso1 aTeodoro de Souza, Reginaldo1 aGómez-Alonso, Sergio1 aGomes, Eleni1 aSilva, Roberto da,1 aHermosín-Gutiérrez, Isidro1 aSilva Lago-Vanzela, Ellen0 tFood chemistry.g2019 Nov. 15, v. 298 p.124971-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2019.1249713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01455naa a2200253 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075024003600099040001800135100001800153245003100171300001600202520065900218592002800877650002000905700001600925700002000941700002600961773011100987852000901098856008201107655001201189991560251750742620221122234531.0181030e197610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7790788442DNAL7 a10.1177/0040517576046010052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBateup, B.

Nonpolar organic liquids and aqueous surfactants gave similar values of γ, but much lower values were obtained with butanol/water mixtures. Adsorption of butanol on the surface of the fibers is thought to be responsible for the low values of γ in the latter case. Removal of lipid material from the surface of fibers by extraction increases γ from 30 mN/m to 37 mN/m, similar to that obtained for horn keratin or polypeptide material. Exposure of fibers to a corona discharge in air at atmospheric pressure also increases γ.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal products1 aCook, J. R.1 aFeldtman, H. D.1 aFleischfresser, B.

Indicators of asexual reproduction capacities (e.g., number of new buds/seedlings) and growth potential (e.g., total biomass, chlorophyll content index, number and length of new roots), as well as the Na+ and K+ concentrations and Na+/K+ ratios were obtained in tested plant species exposed in five alkaline salt treatments (NaHCO3) ranging from 0.3 to 20 dS/m during the 30 day experiment. The following results were observed: 1) excessive NaHCO3 (especially at a salinity level of EC ≥ 10 dS/m) seriously inhibited the capacity of asexual reproduction and continued growth; 2) the number of new buds/seedlings was significantly (P < 0.05) and positively correlated with the number of new roots of plants, while the number of new buds/seedlings was significantly (P < 0.05) and negatively correlated with the total biomass of plants; and 3) species-specific salt-tolerance strategies were observed, i.e., the entry and compartmentalization of Na+ was controlled, and a low Na+/K+ ratios in different parts of plants was maintained. In general, common reed (Phragmites australis), giant reed (Arundo donax), bulrush (Scirpus validus), and fishscale bamboo (Phyllostachys heteroclada) exhibited better saline-alkaline tolerance during asexual reproduction and continued growth under moderate saline-alkaline conditions. These species are recommended as potential plant species for restoring degraded saline-alkaline wetlands.  aPublisher supplied data 3awetlands 3asalt tolerance 3abuds 3aPhragmites australis 3asalinity 3aseedlings 3aasexual reproduction 3aArundo donax 3avegetative propagation 3aPhyllostachys 3aSchoenoplectus tabernaemontani 3asodium bicarbonate 3apotassium 3asodium 3abiomass 3achlorophyll 3abamboos 3aroots 0aHygrophilous plants 0aPa 0aAsexual reproduction 0aNa+/K+ 0aAd 0aPc 0aPh 0aGrowth 0aCi 0aNaHCO3 0aScirpus validus 0aSv 0aAp 0aSaline-alkaline tolerant1 aZhu, H.1 aBañuelos, G.1 aYan, B.1 aShutes, B.1 aLiang, Y.1 aChen, X.0 tSouth African journal of botany.g2018 Sept., v. 118 p.129-137dElsevier B.V.aSouth African Association of BotanistswJournal:jnl34108x0254-62997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sajb.2018.07.0053Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02599naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245010200167300001800269520172400287592002802011650002502039650001202064650001302076650001002089700002202099700001802121773011302139856004802252852000902300655001202309IND50069132320221121181600.0130910e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006913232DNAL7 a10.1007/s00265-013-1580-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrava, Thibault10aHabitat-induced changes in song consistency affect perception of social status in male chickadees  ap. 1699-1707.  aThe ability of male black-capped chickadees to maintain consistent internal structure between successive iterations of their songs is affected by both their social rank and the quality of their habitat. Lab studies reveal that female chickadees discriminate between songs of dominant and subordinate males, which vary in acoustic structure. We investigate whether males also rely on acoustic structure to assess rival quality during agonistic interactions, and whether habitat-induced differences in song consistency affect the perception of male rank. We conducted a playback experiment to simulate territorial intrusions by dominant, stimuli males into the territories of dominant, subject males; stimuli males were recorded either in low-quality (young forest) or high-quality (mature forest) habitats. Stimuli from low-quality habitat had lower song consistency than those from high-quality habitats, despite being recorded from males of equivalent social rank. Subject males for playbacks (also socially dominant males) were chosen from either habitat type. Subject males in mature forest responded less to young-forest stimuli compared to mature-forest stimuli, despite the stimuli in both cases being recorded from dominant males. Conversely, male subjects in young forest did not differentiate between stimuli, but their response to both stimuli was lower than that of mature-forest subject males to mature-forest stimuli. We demonstrate that the ability to maintain internal song structure in the black-capped chickadee constitutes a signal that appears to be used by males to assess the level of threat of intruders, and that this perception is affected by habitat from which the stimulus males were recorded.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPoecile atricapillus 3aforests 3ahabitats 3amales1 aGrava, Angélique1 aOtter, Ken A.0 tBehavioral ecology and sociobiology.g2013 Oct., v. 67, no. 10 p.1699-1707dSpringer-Verlagx0340-54437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00265-013-1580-z  aDNAL 7aarticle01844naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128100002000146245010100166300001400267520090100281592002801182650002201210650001701232650001001249650001501259650002401274700002501298700002401323773010401347856008201451852000901533655001201542IND4471594920221119233608.0150812e20120301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447159492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agee.2011.11.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrincé, Karine10aMixed effectiveness of French agri-environment schemes for nationwide farmland bird conservation  ap. 74-79.  aThe aim of this paper was to evaluate the effectiveness of French AES to enhance farmland bird diversity on a national scale. Abundances of 19 farmland species were modelled in response to AES and then, the relationship between responses of bird to AES and the national population trends of the respective species were explored. Results suggest that AES are implemented at suitable locations to promote biodiversity in agricultural landscapes. Besides, long-term declining species are identified as those that benefit the most from biodiversity-dedicated AES. AES management may not be sufficiently well adapted to the ecological requirements of targeted farmland bird species, given the lack of statistically significant responses. Thus, it is concluded that AES have the potential to protect the abundance strongholds of farmland birds, but apparently fail to enhance ongoing population trends.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3abiodiversity 3abirds 3alandscapes 3apopulation dynamics1 aMoussus, Jean-Pierre1 aJiguet, Frédéric,0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2012 Mar. 1, v. 149 p.74-79dElsevier B.V.x0167-88097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2011.11.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02356naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245014900159500001900308520130700327592002801634650001201662650002201674650001101696650001401707650002001721650001501741650001901756650001001775650001501785700001701800773011901817856007301936852000902009655001202018IND60737151220221119070335.0210514e20210422xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073715122DNAL7 a10.3390/w130911472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Zhiyuan 13aAn Experimental Study on the Influence of Drastically Varying Discharge Ratios on Bed Topography and Flow Structure at Urban Channel Confluences  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe confluences of rivers are important nodes for energy conversion and material transport in the river network. A slight morphological alteration of the confluences may trigger the “butterfly effect”, which will bring about changes in the ecology and environment of the entire river network. During the transition period of the wet and dry seasons, the variation of discharge ratio will make the originally balanced river bed change again, which will bring a series of follow-up effects. This research mainly studied the features of water flow itself and results showed that the variation of discharge ratio caused secondary erosion of the balanced bed surface and transported the sediment downstream. Thus, the zone of maximum velocity was enlarged and the maximum flow velocity at the equal discharge was reduced, and more intense vortex and turbulence were generated. The lateral velocity, vertical velocity, and turbulent structure were mainly controlled by the quantity and ratio of the discharge, and the varying topography only played a minor role in local areas. Nowadays, some scholars have been studying the combination of flow field features and various environmental substances and biological habitats, and the basic work done in this article has laid the foundation for these studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aecology 3aenergy conversion 3arivers 3asediments 3astream channels 3atopography 3aturbulent flow 3awater 3awater flow1 aLin, Yuqing 0 tWater.g2021 Apr. 22, v. 13, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w130911473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03428naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245012500165300001800290520149800308592002801806650001201834650001401846650001201860650001901872650001501891650001501906650002201921650001601943650001701959650001301976650001801989650001302007650002402020650001102044650001702055650001002072650001402082650001802096650001602114650001402130650002302144650001502167653003702182653003202219653001802251653001602269653002102285700001602306700002802322700003002350700001602380700005502396700005702451700005702508773014302565856008502708852000902793655001202802IND60627089820221119042434.0190128e20181221xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062708982DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.8b055462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Zhao10aSolar–Wind–Bio Ecosystem for Biomass Cascade Utilization with Multigeneration of Formic Acid, Hydrogen, and Graphene  ap. 2558-2568.  aThis paper describes the development of a 20MWₜₕ solar–wind–bio-distributed energy system and its viability of achieving biomass cascade utilization, water resource conservation, waste heat recovery, and CO₂ mitigation while coproducing hydrogen, formic acid, and graphene. The proposed ubiquitous energy system model is developed by using ASPEN Plus for the operating parameter optimization and system-wide heat assessment. The system consists of (i) a biomass gasification module, (ii) a biochar utilization module, (iii) a chemical looping hydrogen generation module, (iv) an oxy-syngas combustion module, (v) a CO₂ electroreduction module, and (vi) heat recovery units. Bioenergy is progressively converted through biomass gasification, chemical looping hydrogen generation, syngas combustion, and CO₂ electroreduction. The role of solar energy and wind power is to induce the biomass gasification and CO₂ electroreduction, respectively. The system has been proved to be water-saving with a water recycle efficiency of 70.1% from steam condensation and recovery from the outlets of i, iii, and iv modules. The synergistic effect of parameters such as the CO₂/biomass mass ratio, operation temperatures, and oxygen-carrier/syngas mole ratio is optimized. Furthermore, the carbon migration pathway, water/steam consumption and conservation, energy transformation, and heat supplement of the system are investigated, achieving an optimized system energy efficiency of 59.2%.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiochar 3abioenergy 3abiomass 3acarbon dioxide 3acombustion 3aecosystems 3aenergy efficiency 3aformic acid 3agasification 3agraphene 3aheat recovery 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen production 3amodels 3asolar energy 3asteam 3asynergism 3asynthesis gas 3atemperature 3aviability 3awater conservation 3awind power 0aWind−solar−bio energy system 0aBiomass cascade utilization 0aCO2 reduction 0aFormic acid 0aChemical looping1 aZeng, Liang1 aRussell, Christopher K.1 aAssabumrungrat, Suttichai1 aChen, Shiyi1 aDuan, Lunbo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8210-08511 aXiang, Wenguo1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9989-09361 aGong, Jinlong1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7263-318X0 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2018 Dec. 21, v. 7, no. 2 p.2558-2568dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.8b055463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01849naa a2200241 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075024003600099040001800135100002100153245009400174300001400268520102600282592002801308650001901336650001601355700002501371773010801396852000901504856008201513655001201595991560251660742620221122234547.0181030e197701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7790788662DNAL7 a10.1177/0040517577047001062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMukhopadhyay, U.10aMeasurement of Fiber Length of Jute Slivers Part I: A Study of the Methods of Measurement  ap. 24-28.  aDifficulties in assessing the average fiber length in jute slivers are discussed. Some of the methods that are available for determining the average fiber length are examined and a simple and quick method is suggested. In the method proposed a beard is prepared by clamping the sliver at one point normal to its length and removing the loose fibers from both sides of the clamp. The weight profile of a beard prepared in this way is shown to be reasonably exponential, and hence a plot on semi-log scale will be a straight line. From the slope of the line the average fiber length can be calculated using the formula suggested. Instead of plotting the whole weight profile, the average fiber length can also be calculated from the weights of two 2-in. pieces of the beard cut at two points of the beard, and this cutting method gives values of avenge fiber length that are in good agreement with values obtained from the slope of the log-linear plot. The cutting method proposed is a quick one and appears to be reliable.  aPublisher supplied data 3aplant products 3afield crops1 aBhattacharyya, S.

In this study, cattail litter was added into surface flow constructed wetland (SFCW) system to utilize as the additional carbon source for denitrification process. The adding method for the litter was determined by evaluating the influence of different adding methods on the water environment (pH, dissolved oxygen) and the litter utilization efficiency. Then, the change of effluent organic concentration (total organic carbon, TOC) and nitrogen removal efficiency of the system was investigated after the litter addition, meanwhile, the microbial community change was analyzed by high-throughput sequencing. The results showed that cattail litter should be added in batches to the SFCW system with the dosage of 0.1 g L−1 d−1, and the TN removal and loading of the system were significantly increased without obvious increase of the effluent TOC. After the litter addition, summer had higher increasing level of the denitrification efficiency of the system, which was lower in winter. This study could provide suitable method for cycling utilization of aquatic plant litters, and improve the denitrification effect of SFCW system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquatic plants 3adenitrification 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3amicrobial communities 3anitrogen 3aorganic carbon 3aoverland flow 3aoxygen 3apH 3aplant litter 3asummer 3awetlands 3awinter 0aCattail litter 0aCarbon source 0aNitrogen removal enhancement 0aSurface flow constructed wetland1 aGao, Lei1 aGu, Jianya1 aZhou, Weili1 aFan, Chunzhen1 aHe, Shengbing1 aHuang, Jungchen1 aZhang, Xu1 aChʻeng, I-fan,1 aWu, Ziwei1 aWang, Junchen,0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2018 Dec. 10, v. 204 p.205-211dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.09.0363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01603naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245012100166300001800287520038000305592002800685650002600713650001600739650002300755650003000778650002100808650001100829650001000840650001000850653001800860653002800878653002000906700001700926700001500943700002100958700001900979773011400998856008401112852000901196655001201205IND60122025020221118234744.0150324e20140902xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012202502DNAL7 a10.1080/09583157.2014.9122592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHynes, T.M.10aLarval feeding behaviour of Tetanocera elata (Diptera: Sciomyzidae): potential biocontrol agent of pestiferous slugs  ap. 1077-1082.  aExamining predatory behaviour is useful for determining the potential of novel biocontrol agents.

The natural polyphenol tannic acid (TA) is used to cross-link poly(N-vinylcaprolactam) (PVCL) chains in aqueous droplets by the formation of hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions between the phenolic groups of TA and the carbonyl group and the hydrophobic segments of lactam ring of PVCL chains. The obtained microgels exhibit diameters in the range of 130–150µm in swollen state in aqueous solution. Synthesized microgels exhibit pH-responsive behavior: at low pH microgels deswell and shrink due to the protonation of phenolic groups and enhanced hydrophobic interactions; at high pH microgels swell and disintegrate due to the deprotonation of phenolic groups and destruction of hydrogen bonds with PVCL chains. Additionally, we present supramacromolecular microgels in cylindrical shape with different aspect ratios using a new design of microfluidic chip by varying flow rates at high concentration of the prepolymerized precursor combined with rapid pH-triggered on-chip gelation. Furthermore, developed synthesis methodology allows on-chip encapsulation of colloidal objects into large supramacromolecular microgels during the cross-linking step. The complete and fast release of objects by pH-triggered degradation indicates that the pH-responsive supramacromolecular microgels can be used for controlled loading/release of various payloads, like probiotics. Moreover, cell studies of L929 fibroblast clearly show the biocompatibility of the microgels.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaqueous solutions 3abiocompatibility 3acrosslinking 3adeprotonation 3aencapsulation 3afibroblasts 3agelation 3ahydrogen 3ahydrophobicity 3alactams 3amicrofluidic technology 3amicrogels 3aorgan-on-a-chip 3apH 3apolyphenols 3aprobiotics 3aprotonation 3atannins 0aSupramacromolecular microgels 0aSpherical and rod-shaped microgels 0aTannic acid 0apH-responsiveness 0aDegradation 0aMicrofluidics1 aBulut, S.1 aBusca Guerzoni, L.P.B.1 aGünther, D.1 aBrown, Steve,1 aDe Laporte, L.1 aPich, A.0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2022 July, v. 617 p.409-421dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2022.02.0653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03919naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245012000171300001400291520224600305592002802551650002402579650001702603650001502620650001102635650000902646650001002655650001702665650000902682650000902691650001102700650001402711650001402725650001502739650001102754650001702765650001702782650001902799650000902818650001202827650001002839650001602849650001202865650000902877651000902886653002802895653001702923653001702940653002702957653003102984653002003015700002103035700002003056700002003076773011503096856008503211852000903296655001203305IND60606934920221116152136.0180730e20160515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060693492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2016.02.0352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNorouzi, Samira10aBiomagnetic monitoring of heavy metals contamination in deposited atmospheric dust, a case study from Isfahan, Iran  ap. 55-64.  aTree leaves are considered as one of the best biogenic dust collectors due to their ability to trap and retain particulate matter on their surfaces. In this study, the magnetic susceptibility (MS) and the concentration of selected heavy metals of plane tree (Platanus orientalis L.) leaves and deposited atmospheric dust, sampled by an indirect and a direct method, respectively, were determined to investigate the relationships between leaf magnetic parameters and the concentration of heavy metals in deposited atmospheric dust. The objective was to develop a biomagnetic method as an alternative to the common ones used for determining atmospheric heavy metal contaminations. Plane tree leaves were monthly sampled on the 19th of May to November, 2012 (T1–T7), for seven months from 21 different sites in the city of Isfahan, central Iran. Deposited atmospheric dust samples were also collected using flat glass surfaces from the same sites on the same dates, except for T1. MS (χlf, χhf) values in washed (WL) and unwashed leaves (UL) as well as Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, and Zn concentrations in UL and deposited atmospheric dust samples were determined. The results showed that the MS content with a biogenic source was low with almost no significant change during the sampling period, while an increasing trend was observed in the MS content of UL samples due to the deposition of heavy metals and magnetic particles on leaf surfaces throughout the plant growth. The latter type of MS content could be reduced through washing off by rain. Most heavy metals examined, as well as the Tomlinson pollution load index (PLI) in UL, showed statistically significant correlations with MS values. The correlation between heavy metals content in atmospheric dust deposited on glass surfaces and leaf MS values was significant for Cu, Fe, Pb, and Zn. Moreover, the similarity observed between the spatial distribution maps of leaf MS and deposited atmospheric dust PLI provided convincing evidence regarding the suitability of the biomagnetic approach as a relatively rapid and inexpensive method for identifying highly polluted urban areas with selected heavy metals, especially those subjected to anthropogenic and other traffic related sources.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPlatanus orientalis 3acase studies 3acollectors 3acopper 3adust 3aglass 3aheavy metals 3airon 3alead 3aleaves 3amagnetism 3amanganese 3amonitoring 3anickel 3aparticulates 3aplant growth 3apollution load 3arain 3atraffic 3atrees 3aurban areas 3awashing 3azinc 3aIran 0aMagnetic susceptibility 0aHeavy metals 0aBiomagnetism 0aPlatanus orientalis L. 0aDeposited atmospheric dust 0aUrban pollution1 aKhademi, Hossein1 aCano, Angel Faz1 aAcosta, Jose A.0 tJournal of environmental management.g2016 May 15, v. 173 p.55-64dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2016.02.0353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02699naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245014200164300001600306520147700322592002801799650001701827650001201844650002001856650002201876650001001898650004301908650004401951650001401995650000702009650002502016650001102041650001202052650002202064700001902086773011702105856008202222852000902304655001202313IND60593446820221120075137.0180619e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059344682DNAL7 a10.1007/s10337-018-3503-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZaman, Bakht10aDevelopment of Stability Indicating HPLC–UV Method for Determination of Daclatasvir and Characterization of Forced Degradation Products  ap. 785-797.  aA simple and sensitive stability indicating high performance liquid chromatography method was developed for quantification of Daclatasvir hydrochloride in bulk and tablet dosage forms. The analysis was performed on water symmetry analytical column (150 mm × 3.9 mm, 5 µm), packing octyl silica (Si-[CH₂]₇-CH₃) C8. Mobile phase containing potassium phosphate buffer (pH 2.0) and acetonitrile (38: 62) v/v was used at flow rate 0.7 mL min⁻¹ for isocratic elution. Detection was performed on 304 nm using UV detector. The method was validated appropriately according to the requirements of United State Pharmacopeia and International Conference on Harmonization guideline Q2 (R1). Recovery, precision, linearity and specificity of the method were assured. The correlation coefficient for linearity ranged from 2 to 24 µg mL⁻¹ was (r > 0.9999). The limits of detection and quantification of Daclatasvir were 0.08 and 0.28 µg mL⁻¹, respectively. Stability studies of Daclatasvir were performed under various stressed conditions, i.e., hydrolytic (acidic, basic and neutral), oxidation, photolytic and thermal conditions, according to International Conference on Harmonization Q1A (R2) and QIB Guidelines. The degradation products were resolved using proposed method and further characterized by MS, NMR and IR spectroscopic analyses. The proposed method was successfully applied to assay determination of bulk drugs and tablet dosage forms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetonitrile 3abuffers 3adetection limit 3adrug formulations 3adrugs 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aoxidation 3apH 3apotassium phosphates 3asilica 3asilicon 3aspectral analysis1 aHassan, Waseem0 tChromatographia.g2018 May, v. 81, no. 5 p.785-797dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl1915x0009-58937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10337-018-3503-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03359naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245006900168300001600237500001500253520207700268592002802345650001202373650002302385650002202408650002002430650001202450650002602462650001002488650001202498650001502510650001802525650000902543650001102552650002602563650001602589650001202605651001702617653001802634700002602652700002002678773011302698856008102811852000902892655001202901IND60477940620221117233616.0160108e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047794062DNAL7 a10.1007/s00704-014-1336-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAraujo, Julio A.10aImpacts of drought on grape yields in Western Cape, South Africa  ap. 117-130.  a2019-12-06  aDroughts remain a threat to grape yields in South Africa. Previous studies on the impacts of climate on grape yield in the country have focussed on the impact of rainfall and temperature separately; meanwhile, grape yields are affected by drought, which is a combination of rainfall and temperature influences. The present study investigates the impacts of drought on grape yields in the Western Cape (South Africa) at district and farm scales. The study used a new drought index that is based on simple water balance (Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index; hereafter, SPEI) to identify drought events and used a correlation analysis to identify the relationship between drought and grape yields. A crop simulation model (Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator, APSIM) was applied at the farm scale to investigate the role of irrigation in mitigating the impacts of drought on grape yield. The model gives a realistic simulation of grape yields. The Western Cape has experienced a series of severe droughts in the past few decades. The severe droughts occurred when a decrease in rainfall occurred simultaneously with an increase in temperature. El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) appears to be an important driver of drought severity in the Western Cape, because most of the severe droughts occurred in El Niño years. At the district scale, the correlation between drought index and grape yield is weak (r≈−0.5), but at the farm scale, it is strong (r≈−0.9). This suggests that many farmers are able to mitigate the impacts of drought on grape yields through irrigation management. At the farm scale, where the impact of drought on grape yields is high, poor yield years coincide with moderate or severe drought periods. The APSIM simulation, which gives a realistic simulation of grape yields at the farm scale, suggests that grape yields become more sensitive to spring and summer droughts in the absence of irrigation. Results of this study may guide decision-making on how to reduce the impacts of drought on food security in South Africa.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEl Nino 3aevapotranspiration 3asimulation models 3adecision making 3afarmers 3aproduction technology 3afarms 3adrought 3acrop yield 3afood security 3arain 3asummer 3airrigation management 3atemperature 3aclimate 3aSouth Africa 0awater balance1 aAbiodun, Babatunde J.1 aCrespo, Olivier0 tTheoretical and applied climatology.g2016 Jan., v. 123, no. 1-2 p.117-130dSpringer Viennax0177-798X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00704-014-1336-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02111naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245005900168300001600227520094300243592002801186650002301214650003501237650002201272650001501294650001501309650001301324650002201337650001501359650001001374653002101384653001501405653000801420653001801428653001401446700002101460700001701481773010901498856008501607852000901692655001201701IND60649387420221120093534.0190704e20190704xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064938742DNAL7 a10.1080/01426397.2018.14951842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNazer, Samar10aLandscape change in Ramallah—Palestine (1994–2014)  ap. 541-556.  aThe Palestinian landscape has always been subjected to dynamic processes of change. This article examines the landscape change in Ramallah city during the last 20 years by analysing two aerial photographs from two periods—1994 and 2014—to create land cover maps which illustrate the change in different landscape classes in the city. The article aims to quantify the landscape change in the specified periods using GIS and FRAGSTATS analysis, and to identify and explain spatial patterns of the landscape, taking into consideration the political, social, and economic circumstances. The results reveal a considerable change and fragmentation. The main change is an increase in the built-up area at the expense of a decrease in the permanent trees and scrub areas. This change, due to the occupation policies, is a reflection of many indicators, including population growth, migration, and an economic boom in the construction sector.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerial photography 3ageographic information systems 3aissues and policy 3aland cover 3alandscapes 3apolitics 3apopulation growth 3ashrublands 3atrees 0aLandscape change 0aland cover 0aGIS 0aRamallah city 0aPalestine1 aAbughannam, Rana1 aKhasib, Sara0 tLandscape research.g2019 July 4, v. 44, no. 5 p.541-556dRoutledgewJournal:J000000120x1469-97107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01426397.2018.14951843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02661naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245015900167520111500326592002801441650001601469650001201485650001601497650001501513650003101528650001001559650001301569650001501582650001501597650001701612650001301629650001301642650001501655650001101670653001101681653001501692653001501707653001701722653001501739700001401754700001801768700001701786700002401803700002201827700001501849700001501864700005601879773010001935856008702035852000902122655001202131IND60647497820221121025918.0190628e20191101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064749782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2019.1250162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeng, Zhou10aIntegrated proteomic and metabolomic analysis suggests high rates of glycolysis are likely required to support high carotenoid accumulation in banana pulp  aTo gain a better understanding concerning factors underlying carotenoid metabolism in banana pulp we investigated the carotenoid profile, metabolome, proteome and relative expression levels of carotegenesis-associated genes of fruit pulp in the two banana varieties ON and GN, with ON being characterized of high carotenoid accumulation. Results showed that high carotenoid content in banana pulp was well correlated with the relative expression of carotenogenesis-associated genes and the abundance of the corresponding proteins. An elevated accumulation of sugar metabolism-related compounds and a decreased amino acid accumulation were also observed in ON. Additionally proteins involved in the glycolytic pathway were more highly abundant in ON suggesting that this supports the higher accumulation of carotenoid in this genotype. We suggest that up-regulated expression of carotenogenesis-associated genes alongside elevated carbohydrate accumulation contribute to high carotenoid content in banana pulp, implying that a multi-target approach is necessary in order to improve carotenoid content in banana.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acids 3abananas 3acarotenoids 3afruit pulp 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3agenotype 3aglycolysis 3ametabolome 3ametabolomics 3aproteins 3aproteome 3aproteomics 3asugars 0aBanana 0aCarotenoid 0aProteomics 0aMetabolomics 0aGlycolysis1 aSheng, Ou1 aHuang, Wenjie1 aZhang, Sheng1 aFernie, Alisdair R.1 aMotorykin, Ievgen1 aKong, Qian1 aYi, Ganjun1 aYan, Shijuan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6907-11790 tFood chemistry.g2019 Nov. 01, v. 297 p.125016-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2019.1250163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01707naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245015200164300001600316520039900332592002800731650001800759650002800777650002300805650003000828650001100858650001600869650002300885650001600908650001900924650000700943650000900950650001600959653002900975653001501004653002301019653002301042700001601065773011101081856008401192852000901276655001201285IND60122017320221121014659.0150324e20140102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012201732DNAL7 a10.1080/09583157.2013.8442242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Tian10aSuppression of Rhizoctonia solani and induction of host plant resistance by Paenibacillus kribbensis PS04 towards controlling of rice sheath blight  ap. 116-121.  aWe have identified a promising antagonistic micro-organism for suppressing Rhizoctonia solani and triggering induced resistance in rice.

We sought to assess the effects of artificial drainage on the population dynamics of the European pond turtle (Emys orbicularis). We investigated whether the probability of survival and emigration/immigration was affected by short‐term drawdown (for a few months over winter) or long‐term habitat drainage (a full year of drying out) in this long‐lived species of low dispersal ability. The study was replicated in two different areas using a Capture–Recapture monitoring programme over 5 years. In the two areas, we marked 1412 and 282 individuals, respectively. Short‐term drawdown had no impact on the vital rates of this species, while long‐term drainage promoted greater mobility among the ponds in both areas. This increase in movement might reduce survival, due to road mortality, or result in turtles leaving the study area. Moreover, as the transition probability between ponds was higher when ponds were close together and directly connected, for instance by a ditch, the construction and maintenance of ditches might reduce the effects of drainage. To implement effective conservation plans, studies that aim to assess the effect of human disturbance should monitor population dynamics and vital rates to allow a more complete picture of the real impacts.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3adrainage 3adrainage systems 3adrawdown 3adrought 3adrying 3afreshwater 3ahabitats 3ahumans 3aimmigration 3alandscapes 3amonitoring 3amortality 3aponds 3apopulation dynamics 3aprobability 3aturtles 3awinter1 aPriol, Pauline1 aThienpont, Stephanie1 aCheylan, Marc1 aSauret, Gabrielle1 aCoïc, Christophe1 aBesnard, Aurélien0 tFreshwater biology.g2016 Jan., v. 61, no. 1 p.121-132dBlackwell Scientific Publicationsx0046-50707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.126873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01902naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001500139245005600154300001400210520097600224592002801200650002901228650002601257650001101283650001401294650001401308650001901322650001301341650001301354773013801367856007401505852000901579655001201588IND60765230620221120062042.0220419e20120208xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076523062DNAL7 a10.17221/4949-rae2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGaduš, J.10aOptimization of&nbsp;frameworks by means of fem use  ap. 32-36.  aThe paper presents an application of an optimization procedure for a mass optimization of a welded framework of a&nbsp;special tractor trailer designed for transport of seeding machines. The used optimization procedure, so-called Fully Stressed Design (FSD), is based on an&nbsp;indirect approach utilizing optimum criteria. The aim of the optimization was to achieve the lowest possible mass of the construction taking into consideration the allowed resistance. As the paper shows, on the basis of the optimization procedure we achieved more than 35% savings of the material mass. In this way the optimization procedures have an important and unreplaceable role in practice, because they result in significant material savings keeping the required resistance and consistency parameters of constructions.

Bovine brucellosis, as caused primarily by Brucella abortus, is an important cause of reproductive loss in cattle. Vaccination has been the most effective way to reduce disease prevalence contributing to the success of control and eradication programs. Currently, there are no human vaccines available, and despite the success of commercial vaccines for livestock, such as B. abortus strain RB51 (RB51), there is need for development of novel and safer vaccines against brucellosis. In the current study, we report the fabrication of and immune responses to an implantable single dose polyanhydride-based, methanol-killed RB51 antigen containing delivery platform (VPEAR) in cattle. In contrast to animals vaccinated with RB51, we did not observe measurable RB51-specific IFN-γ or IgG responses in the peripheral blood, following initial vaccination with VPEAR. However, following a subsequent booster vaccination with RB51, we observed an anamnestic response in both vaccination treatments (VPEAR and live RB51). The magnitude and kinetics of CD4+ IFN-γ-mediated responses and circulating memory T cell subpopulations were comparable between the two vaccination treatments. Additionally, IgG titers were significantly increased in animals vaccinated with VPEAR as compared to live RB51- vaccinated animals. These data demonstrate that killed antigen may be utilized to generate and sustain memory, IFN-γ-mediated, CD4+ T cell and humoral responses against Brucella in a natural host. To our knowledge, this novel approach to vaccination against intracellular bacteria, such as Brucella, has not been reported before.  aPublisher supplied data  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000001990 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBrucella melitensis biovar Abortus 3aCD4-positive T-lymphocytes 3aantigens 3abovine brucellosis 3acattle 3adisease prevalence 3afinancial economics 3ahumans 3amemory 3apublic health 3asecondary immunization 3avaccination 3avaccines 3azoonoses 0aImmunology 0aInfectious disease 0aImmune response 0aAntibody 0aBacteria 0aPolyanhydride 0aVaccine 0aSingle-dose 0aBrucella1 aSchaut, Robert G.1 aKanipe, Carly1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6024-75801 aKelly, Sean M.1 aNarasimhan, Balaji1 aJones, Douglas E.1 aOlsen, Steven C.0 tHeliyon.g2019 Aug., v. 5, no. 8 p.e02370-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2019.e023703Available from publisher's site  aVersion of Record  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle03526naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245009700170300001600267520171500283592002801998650002502026650002502051650002202076650001202098650001502110650002602125650002502151650001102176650001802187650001102205650001802216650001302234650002602247650001202273650002402285650000902309653001102318653001202329653002102341653002502362653002802387653003102415653002502446653001202471653001102483653000802494653000902502653000802511653000802519653001002527700001902537700001802556700002102574700001702595700002602612700002002638773012402658856008502782852000902867655001202876IND60613589920221120193609.0220914e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061358992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.plaphy.2018.08.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aInoue, Shintaro10aTissue-specific and intracellular localization of indican synthase from Polygonum tinctorium  ap. 138-144.  aThe plant Polygonum tinctorium produces the secondary metabolite indican (indoxyl-β-D-glucoside), a precursor of the blue dye indigo. P. tinctorium synthesizes indican through the actions of the UDP-glucosyltransferase (UGT), indican synthase. Herein, we partially purified an indican synthase from the leaves and subsequently performed peptide mass fingerprinting analysis. Consequently, we identified a fragment that was homologous to a UDP-glucosyltransferase 72B (UGT72B) family member. We named it PtIgs (P. tinctoriumindoxyl-β-D-glucoside synthase) and obtained the full-length cDNA using rapid amplification of the cDNA ends. The primary structure of PtIGS, which PtIgs encoded, showed high identity with indican synthases (ItUGT1 and ItUGT2) from Indigofera tinctoria (Inoue et al., 2017). Moreover, in expression analyses of P. tinctorium, PtIGS mRNA was virtually found only in the leaves, was most highly expressed in the 1st leaves, and decreased with leaf age. Because PtIGS expression tended to reflect indican contents and synthesis activities, we concluded that PtIGS functions as an indican synthase in plant cells. To examine intracellular localization of PtIGS, crude leaf extracts were separated into cytosol and microsome fractions, and found PtIGS in the cytosol and in microsome fractions. Furthermore, microsomal PtIGS was soluble in the presence of detergents and urea and was strongly associated with membranes. Finally, we confirmed endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane localization of PtIGS using ultracentrifugation with a sucrose density gradient. These data suggest that PtIGS interacts with some kind of proteins on ER membranes to certainly carry out a delivery of substrate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aIndigofera tinctoria 3aPersicaria tinctoria 3acomplementary DNA 3acytosol 3adetergents 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3aglucosyltransferases 3aindigo 3aleaf extracts 3aleaves 3amessenger RNA 3aproteins 3asecondary metabolites 3asucrose 3aultracentrifugation 3aurea 0aIndigo 0aIndican 0aIndican synthase 0aSecondary metabolism 0aUDP-Glucosyltransferase 0aIntracellular localization 0aPolygonum tinctorium 0aindican 0aindigo 0aUGT 0aRACE 0aIGS 0aBiP 0aG6PDH1 aMorita, Rihito1 aKuwata, Keiko1 aKunieda, Tadashi1 aUeda, Haruko1 aHara-Nishimura, Ikuko1 aMinami, Yoshiko0 tPlant physiology and biochemistry.g2018 Nov., v. 132 p.138-144dElsevier Masson SASwJournal:jnl41590x0981-94287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plaphy.2018.08.0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02783naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245008800168300001600256520118300272592002801455596009001483650002101573650002301594650002301617650001501640650002101655650001001676650001001686650001701696650002601713650001201739650001101751650002801762650001101790650001301801650002001814650000901834650001201843650002201855650001301877653001901890653000901909700001901918700001601937700002701953700001501980700001601995773013602011856008502147852000902232655001202241IND60638858720221121191039.0190430e20190403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063885872DNAL7 a10.1080/09670874.2018.14948642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhmed, M.

To develop an integrated management of aphid powders of black pepper, chili, turmeric, and coriander; oils of mahogany, neem, and eucalyptus; aqueous extracts of neem, basil, and garlic leaves; and water were evaluated in field conditions. The treatments were applied at 7 day intervals and aphid abundance per inflorescence was counted at 24, 48, and 72 h after treatment. All the plant materials reduced aphid abundance and flower infestation, ensuring a higher yield with larger and heavier pods. The neem oil treatment had the lowest abundance of aphid and consequently produced the highest marketable and gross yields. Predatory insects were abundant in the field, but their populations were lower in the treatments than the control. An economic analysis indicated that the highest gross return, net return, adjusted net return, and benefit-cost ratio were obtained from the mahogany oil treatment. The plant materials have insecticidal potential against aphids, and the oils of mahogany and neem showed better performances.  aPublisher supplied data  cRMC of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Agricultural University, Gazipur, Bangladesh 3aAphis craccivora 3aAzadirachta indica 3aCoriandrum sativum 3aEucalyptus 3aLablab purpureus 3abasil 3abeans 3ablack pepper 3acost benefit analysis 3aflowers 3agarlic 3ainsecticidal properties 3aleaves 3aneem oil 3apest management 3apods 3apowders 3apredatory insects 3aturmeric 0aplant extracts 0aoils1 aMiah, M.

Such a dichotomy is due to several factors that have been ignored over the last two decades. The hardest challenge seems to occur when PEGylated CLs come into contact with a physiological environment (e.g. the blood). Recent evidence has demonstrated that PEGylation does not completely prevent protein binding (as believed so far), but a biomolecular shell, termed “biomolecular corona” (BC), covers the liposome surface. Here we show that the formation of a BC not only affects the surface properties of PEGylated CLs, but also, and significantly, their bilayer structure thus impairing their ability to safely deliver their cargo to the target site. Therefore, a mechanistic understanding of the structures emerging from liposome–protein interactions may represent a truly new paradigm for the clinical translation of PEGylated CLs.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood 3achemical bonding 3agene therapy 3aprotein binding1 aPozzi, Daniela1 aAmenitsch, Heinz1 aCaracciolo, Giulio0 tBiomaterials science.g2017 Aug. 22, v. 5, no. 9 p.1884-1888dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26911x2047-48497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7bm00387k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03329naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245015200159300001600311520207500327592002802402650001602430650001702446650002402463650002002487650001002507650003302517650001402550651001402564651001502578651001802593651001602611651001802627700002102645700001702666700002102683700001702704773011602721856007302837852000902910655001202919IND50085920820221118231915.0150206e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008592082DNAL7 a10.1111/jbi.122652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThomas, Nanette10aMolecular dating of Winteraceae reveals a complex biogeographical history involving both ancient Gondwanan vicariance and long‐distance dispersal  ap. 894-904.  aAIM: Our aim was to implement a molecular dating analysis and assess divergence times among taxa of Winteraceae. This enabled us to test hypotheses of vicariance versus long‐distance dispersal to explain intercontinental disjunctions in the family. LOCATION: Madagascar, Australia (including Lord Howe Island), New Zealand, New Caledonia and South America. METHODS: We sampled all Australian species and subspecies of Winteraceae. We also included the monotypic Takhtajania perrieri and at least two species of each genus from New Zealand, New Caledonia and South America. Three sets of sequences were combined into one data matrix, including two internal transcribed spacer (ITS) data sets and a trnL–F data set. Both ITS data sets included all genera of Winteraceae, and the paralogous genes identified in Zygogynum s.l. in a previous study were sequenced and aligned in separate ITS data sets. A Bayesian molecular phylogenetic tree of extant Winteraceae was used as a backbone constraint in paup* to establish the placement of fossils. Bayesian analyses were performed using beast, implementing fossil priors to fit lognormal distributions, to test a maximum‐parsimony phylogeny and assess divergence times. RESULTS: Interspecific relationships generally agreed with previous analyses. In particular, Bubbia comptonii was found to be sister to the rest of the Bubbia/Zygogynum clade, but our analysis has uniquely found sister clades within this group: one from New Caledonia, and one from Australia including Lord Howe Island. The phylogeny yields an age of 91.2 Ma with a 95% confidence interval of 118–67 Ma for crown‐group Winteraceae. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: The estimated age of Takhtajania is consistent with its origin in Madagascar as a result of Gondwanan vicariance – the only angiosperm for which this has been demonstrated with confidence. Differentiation of the rest of this ancient clade is a complicated story of vicariance as a result of the rifting, submergence and exhumation of continents and of long‐distance dispersal and extinctions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWinteraceae 3abiogeography 3aconfidence interval 3adata collection 3agenes 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3aphylogeny 3aAustralia 3aMadagascar 3aNew Caledonia 3aNew Zealand 3aSouth America1 aBruhl, Jeremy J.1 aFord, Andrew1 aWeston, Peter H.1 aEbach, Malte0 tJournal of biogeography.g2014 May, v. 41, no. 5 p.894-904dBlackwell Scientific Publications.x0305-02707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jbi.122653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02905naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245010000168300001600268520139200284592002801676650001801704650001301722650002001735650001201755650001201767650001201779650001301791650002701804650001401831650001701845650001401862650001301876650001401889650001901903650002201922650001901944650001401963650002301977650001202000650001502012650001702027650001502044651001502059700002002074700002502094700002802119700001602147773011002163856008102273852000902354655001202363IND60173860920221121042956.0151024e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017386092DNAL7 a10.1007/s10533-015-0087-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRossi, Robert J.10aResponses of roadside soil cation pools to vehicular emission deposition in southern California  ap. 131-144.  aRoadside soils are heavily loaded with reactive nitrogen due to vehicular emissions, and these loadings likely acidify near-road soils. Cationic metals are mobilized from acidified soils during exchange reactions. Depletion of soil cation pools is well documented in forest soils, but poorly understood in roadside soils despite heavy nitrogen loadings to roadside environments and the continued growth of road networks. This study considers soil acidification impacts across gradients of soil chemistry, road network density, climate, and geology in southern California, clarifying acidification processes in near-road environments. Although there is no direct relationship between soil pH and road proximity, several elements (Al, Be, K) are depleted in near-road environments. The depletion of these elements occurs despite more sediment surface area and organic matter in near-road soils. In contrast, the weathering of road construction materials (i.e., concrete) replenishes soil Ca and Mg pools and likely buffers soil pH. These observed near-road patterns in soil chemistry point to the potential for mobilization of metal contamination from roadside environments. Improved understanding of metal dynamics in roadside soils is essential to the effective management of road-sourced nutrients and storm water, particularly as expanding road networks continue to affect wider areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidification 3aaluminum 3abiogeochemistry 3abuffers 3acalcium 3aclimate 3aconcrete 3aconstruction materials 3aemissions 3aforest soils 3amagnesium 3anitrogen 3anutrients 3aorganic matter 3aroad construction 3aroadside soils 3asediments 3asoil acidification 3asoil pH 3astormwater 3asurface area 3aweathering 3aCalifornia1 aBain, Daniel J.1 aDarrel Jenerette, G.1 aClarke, Lorraine Weller1 aWilson, Kat0 tBiogeochemistry.g2015 May, v. 124, no. 1-3 p.131-144dSpringer International Publishingx0168-25637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10533-015-0087-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03029naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245013200166520158200298592002801880650001601908650001301924650001301937650000901950650003501959650001001994650001902004650001102023650002602034650001402060650001102074650001802085650000902103650001102112650001902123650001202142650001302154650001502167650002502182650005202207650002002259700001902279700002002298700002102318773010502339856008202444852000902526655001202535IND60687433520221122054900.0200614e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068743352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gep.2020.1191102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGhilardi, Anna10aExpression pattern of the small muscle protein, X-linked (smpx) gene during zebrafish embryonic and larval developmental stages  aThe small muscle protein, X-linked (SMPX) gene encodes a cytoskeleton-associated protein, highly expressed in both cardiac and skeletal muscles, as well as in fetal inner ears, with suggested roles as mechanotransductor. Recently, several mutations in the SMPX gene have been associated with X-chromosomal progressive deafness in human. However, very little information is known concerning the roles of SMPX, and no in-vivo models are currently available. Therefore, we characterized the zebrafish ortholog of SMPX to pave the way towards the establishment of a biotool for future functional studies. Despite the genome duplication occurred in the ancestry of teleosts, zebrafish retain only one copy of smpx which shares a high degree of similarity with the mammalian counterpart in terms of genomic organization, syntenic map, and encoded protein. RT-PCR, as well as whole-mount in-situ hybridization and immunofluorescence analyses, revealed that smpx is expressed in several embryonic areas starting from the 4-somite stage. Specifically, smpx mRNA marked the Kupffer's vesicle (KV), the somites, the myocardium, the hair cells of the anterior and the posterior macula of the inner ear, the pronephric ducts, and the muscles of the branchial arches, eyes and pectoral fins. According to our data, zebrafish smpx expression pattern closely resembles that observed in mouse and human, supporting the notion that zebrafish might represent a suitable in-vivo model to disclose the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the involvement of SMPX in development and disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDanio rerio 3aancestry 3adeafness 3aeyes 3afluorescent antibody technique 3agenes 3ahuman diseases 3ahumans 3ain situ hybridization 3ainner ear 3alarvae 3amessenger RNA 3amice 3amodels 3amuscle protein 3amuscles 3amutation 3amyocardium 3anucleotide sequences 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3askeletal muscle1 aDiana, Alberto1 aProsperi, Laura1 aDel Giacco, Luca0 tGene expression patterns.g2020 June, v. 36 p.119110-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12408x1567-133X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gep.2020.1191103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02883naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100003000140245011700170520147700287592002801764650002501792650002001817650001501837650002501852650002801877650001101905650003001916650001401946650001601960650001701976650001501993650001402008650001502022650001502037650001602052650001402068650002002082650001702102700002502119700002102144700002102165700002002186773012302206856007502329852000902404655001202413IND60760797520221122164150.0211223e20211218xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076079752DNAL7 a10.3390/nu131245502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoyajian, Jacqueline Lena10aMicrobiome and Human Aging: Probiotic and Prebiotic Potentials in Longevity, Skin Health and Cellular Senescence  aThe role of the microbiome in human aging is important: the microbiome directly impacts aging through the gastrointestinal system. However, the microbial impact on skin has yet to be fully understood. For example, cellular senescence is an intrinsic aging process that has been recently associated with microbial imbalance. With age, cells become senescent in response to stress wherein they undergo irreversible growth arrest while maintaining high metabolic activity. An accumulation of senescent cells has been linked to various aging and chronic pathologies due to an overexpression of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) comprised of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, proteases, lipids and extracellular matrix components. In particular, dermatological disorders may be promoted by senescence as the skin is a common site of accumulation. The gut microbiota influences cellular senescence and skin disruption through the gut-skin axis and secretion of microbial metabolites. Metabolomics can be used to identify and quantify metabolites involved in senescence. Moreover, novel anti-senescent therapeutics are warranted given the poor safety profiles of current pharmaceutical drugs. Probiotics and prebiotics may be effective alternatives, considering the relationship between the microbiome and healthy aging. However, further research on gut composition under a senescent status is needed to develop immunomodulatory therapies.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiochemical pathways 3acell senescence 3achemokines 3aextracellular matrix 3agastrointestinal system 3ahumans 3aintestinal microorganisms 3alongevity 3ametabolites 3ametabolomics 3amicrobiome 3aphenotype 3aprebiotics 3aprobiotics 3aproteinases 3asecretion 3astress response 3atherapeutics1 aGhebretatios, Merry 1 aSchaly, Sabrina 1 aIslam, Paromita 1 aPrakash, Satya 0 tNutrients.g2021 Dec. 18, v. 13, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu131245503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02838naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245010400165300001400269520139500283592002801678650001001706650000901716650001801725650001301743650001301756650001001769650002401779650002101803650001401824650001701838650001201855650001001867650001801877650001001895650001601905650001701921653001401938653003301952653002301985653002302008653003202031700001702063700001802080773015402098856008302252852000902335655001202344IND60610209920221122042954.0190516e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061020992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.sajb.2018.07.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVudala, S.M.10aMicropropagation of Hadrolaelia grandis through transverse and longitudinal thin cell layer culture  ap. 76-82.  aAn efficient in vitro propagation method was established for Hadrolaelia grandis using transverse and longitudinal thin cell layer (tTCL and lTCL, respectively) culture systems. Two and three-month old protocorms from in vitro germinated seeds were used for this study. tTCl and lTCL (0.5 mm thick) from protocorms were cultured on Woody Plant Medium (WPM) supplemented with benzyladenine (BA) (0, 1.1, 2.2, 4.4, 8.8 and 17.6 μM). The elongation and root development of protocorm-like bodies (PLBs) were evaluated in medium containing activated charcoal (0, 1, 2 and 3 g·L−1) or indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) (0, 1.25, 2.5, 5.0 and 10 μM). The plantlets were transplanted in polystyrene trays containing: coconut powder, pine bark with humus worm and vermiculite. The highest percentage (70.8%) and total number of PLBs per explant (30.1) were obtained from transversal protocorm sections two-month old cultured on WPM medium supplemented with 2.2 μM BA. The lTCL technique was more efficient with sections from three-month old protocorms grown in medium containing 8.8 μM BAP (83.3% of PLBs and 34.4 PLBs regenerated per explant). PLB development was optimal on WPM medium containing 1.0 g·L−1 activated charcoal, and IBA was not necessary for rooting. Plantlets were successfully acclimatized (with a survival rate of 98.2%) when vermiculite was used as a substrate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus 3abark 3abenzyladenine 3acharcoal 3acoconuts 3ahumus 3aindole butyric acid 3amicropropagation 3aplantlets 3apolystyrenes 3arooting 3aseeds 3asurvival rate 3atrays 3avermiculite 3awoody plants 0aProtocorm 0aProtocorm-like bodies (PLBs) 0aBenzyladenine (BA) 0aActivated charcoal 0aIndole-3-butyric acid (IBA)1 aPadial, A.A.1 aRibas, L.L.F.0 tSouth African journal of botany.g2019 Mar., v. 121 p.76-82dElsevier B.V.aSouth African Association of BotanistswJournal:jnl34108x0254-62997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sajb.2018.07.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02534naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245010000168300001600268520135300284592002801637650002201665650001501687650001301702650001901715650001701734650001301751650001901764653002401783653001801807653002601825653000701851653000801858700001601866700001601882700001501898700001701913773009801930856008702028852000902115655001202124IND60584784420221120165443.0180830e20170315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058478442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.12.0732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Mingxin14aThe characteristics of recycled NO reduction over char during oxy-fuel fluidized bed combustion  ap. 553-562.  aTo explain the reduction process of recycled NO over char during oxy-fuel fluidized bed combustion, the characteristics associated with the reduction of recycled NO were investigated in the present study. The experimental results were obtained using a bubbling fluidized bed. The effects of typical impurities within the recycled flue gas on the reduction of recycled NO were also studied. It was determined that significant reduction of the recycled NO over char occurred under oxy-fuel fluidized bed combustion conditions. The apparent activation energy of the recycled NO reduction reaction was much lower when combustion occurred. The competition between the NO formation from char nitrogen and the reduction of recycled NO over char determined the final NO concentration of the flue gas. The recycled NO concentration had little influence on the reduction ratios during oxy-fuel fluidized bed combustion when NO formation from char nitrogen was considered. Recycled SO2 can enhance the reduction of recycled NO over char during oxy-fuel combustion while the low concentration of recycled CO had a little effect on the process of recycled NO reduction. The reduction ratios of recycled NO increased as the recycled SO2 concentration increased. Moreover, significant capture of recycled SO2 was observed during oxy-fuel fluidized bed combustion.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivation energy 3acombustion 3aflue gas 3afluidized beds 3anitric oxide 3anitrogen 3asulfur dioxide 0aOxy-fuel combustion 0aFluidized bed 0aRecycled NO reduction 0aCO 0aSO21 aLi, Shiyuan1 aWu, Yinghai1 aJia, Lufei1 aLu, Qinggang0 tApplied energy.g2017 Mar. 15, v. 190 p.553-562dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.12.0733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03112naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006300147245012800210300001200338520175100350592002802101596005302129596005002182596004502232650002302277650002202300650001602322650001302338650001502351650001502366650001102381700002302392700002502415700002302440700002202463773015002485856008202635852000902717655001202726IND60593447420221120032501.0180904e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059344742DNAL7 a10.1007/s10661-018-6673-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReinhold, Ann Marie1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0411-348610aLandscape assessment of side channel plugs and associated cumulative side channel attrition across a large river floodplain  ap. 305.  aDetermining the influences of anthropogenic perturbations on side channel dynamics in large rivers is important from both assessment and monitoring perspectives because side channels provide critical habitat to numerous aquatic species. Side channel extents are decreasing in large rivers worldwide. Although riprap and other linear structures have been shown to reduce side channel extents in large rivers, we hypothesized that small “anthropogenic plugs” (flow obstructions such as dikes or berms) across side channels modify whole-river geomorphology via accelerating side channel senescence. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a geospatial assessment, comparing digitized side channel areas from aerial photographs taken during the 1950s and 2001 along 512 km of the Yellowstone River floodplain. We identified longitudinal patterns of side channel recruitment (created/enlarged side channels) and side channel attrition (destroyed/senesced side channels) across n = 17 river sections within which channels were actively migrating. We related areal measures of recruitment and attrition to the density of anthropogenic side channel plugs across river sections. Consistent with our hypothesis, a positive spatial relationship existed between the density of anthropogenic plugs and side channel attrition, but no relationship existed between plug density and side channel recruitment. Our work highlights important linkages among side channel plugs and the persistence and restoration of side channels across floodplain landscapes. Specifically, management of small plugs represents a low-cost, high-benefit restoration opportunity to facilitate scouring flows in side channels to enable the persistence of these habitats over time.  aPublisher supplied data  aMIPR-59XQG72647975cU.S. Army Corps of Engineers  aMIPR-W59XQG6913cU.S. Army Corps of Engineers  aEPS-1101342cNational Science Foundation 3aaerial photography 3aaquatic organisms 3afloodplains 3ahabitats 3alandscapes 3amonitoring 3arivers1 aPoole, Geoffrey C.1 aBramblett, Robert G.1 aZale, Alexander V.1 aRoberts, David W.0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2018 May, v. 190, no. 5 p.305-305dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl33242x0167-63697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-018-6673-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03342naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100006000154245009000214300001800304520191100322592002802233650001302261650001802274650001602292650003102308650001102339650001902350650002802369650001302397650002202410650001602432653002202448653001902470653001902489653002602508653001202534653001102546653002802557653001102585653001902596700005702615773011402672856008902786852000902875655001202884IND60557186220221122091609.0180830e20161115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055718622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biotechadv.2016.08.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChoi, Kyeong Rok1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9621-486010aCRISPR technologies for bacterial systems: Current achievements and future directions  ap. 1180-1209.  aThroughout the decades of its history, the advances in bacteria-based bio-industries have coincided with great leaps in strain engineering technologies. Recently unveiled clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated proteins (Cas) systems are now revolutionizing biotechnology as well as biology. Diverse technologies have been derived from CRISPR/Cas systems in bacteria, yet the applications unfortunately have not been actively employed in bacteria as extensively as in eukaryotic organisms. A recent trend of engineering less explored strains in industrial microbiology—metabolic engineering, synthetic biology, and other related disciplines—is demanding facile yet robust tools, and various CRISPR technologies have potential to cater to the demands. Here, we briefly review the science in CRISPR/Cas systems and the milestone inventions that enabled numerous CRISPR technologies. Next, we describe CRISPR/Cas-derived technologies for bacterial strain development, including genome editing and gene expression regulation applications. Then, other CRISPR technologies possessing great potential for industrial applications are described, including typing and tracking of bacterial strains, virome identification, vaccination of bacteria, and advanced antimicrobial approaches. For each application, we note our suggestions for additional improvements as well. In the same context, replication of CRISPR/Cas-based chromosome imaging technologies developed originally in eukaryotic systems is introduced with its potential impact on studying bacterial chromosomal dynamics. Also, the current patent status of CRISPR technologies is reviewed. Finally, we provide some insights to the future of CRISPR technologies for bacterial systems by proposing complementary techniques to be developed for the use of CRISPR technologies in even wider range of applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3abacteria 3abiotechnology 3achromosomes 3agene expression regulation 3agenome 3aimage analysis 3aindustrial applications 3aproteins 3asynthetic biology 3avaccination 0aCRISPR/Cas system 0aCas9, bacteria 0aGenome editing 0aExpression regulation 0aImaging 0aTyping 0aVaccination of bacteria 0aVirome 0aAntimicrobials1 aLee, Sang Yup1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0599-30910 tBiotechnology advances.g2016 Nov. 15, v. 34, no. 7 p.1180-1209dElsevier Inc.wJournal:6288x0734-97507nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biotechadv.2016.08.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02604naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245008000164520139100244592002801635650002301663650001101686650001401697650001401711650002301725650003101748650001401779700001801793700001801811700002201829700002201851700002601873700002301899700002101922700002501943700002301968773012401991856008202115852000902197655001202206IND60760809820221119134932.0211223e20211127xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076080982DNAL7 a10.3390/pathogens101215492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaib, Israa 10aNon-SARS Non-MERS Human Coronaviruses: Clinical Characteristics and Outcome  aHuman coronaviruses (HCoVs) have become evident sources of human respiratory infections with new emerging HCoVs as a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. The common four coronaviruses (229E, HKU1, NL63, and OC43) are known to cause respiratory illness in humans, but their clinical impact is poorly described in the literature. We analyzed the data of all patients who tested positive for at least one of the four HCoVs from October 2015 to January 2020 in a tertiary care center. HCoVs were detected in 1062 specimens, with an incidence rate of 1.01%, out of all documented respiratory illnesses. Detection of these viruses was reported sporadically throughout the years, with a peak of occurrence during winter seasons. OC43 had the highest incidence (53.7%), followed by NL63 (21.9%), HKU1 (12.6%), and 229E (11.8%). Most of these infections were community-acquired, with symptoms of both upper and lower respiratory tract. Co-detection with other viruses were observed, mostly with rhinovirus. 229E was the most frequent (26.4%) HCoV in patients requiring intensive care, while NL63 and 229E were the most common in patients requiring invasive ventilation. The highest 30-day mortality rate was observed in patients infected with 229E (6.4%). HCoVs are common circulating pathogens that have been present for decades, with 229E being the most virulent in this study cohort.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOrthocoronavirinae 3ahumans 3amorbidity 3amortality 3arespiratory system 3arespiratory tract diseases 3avirulence1 aAleisa, Saud 1 aArdah, Husam 1 aMahmoud, Ebrahim 1 aAlharbi, Ahmad O.1 aAlsaedy, Abdulrahman 1 aAljohani, Sameera 1 aAlshehri, Ahmed 1 aAlharbi, Naif Khalaf1 aBosaeed, Mohammad 0 tPathogens.g2021 Nov. 27, v. 10, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27146x2076-08177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/pathogens101215493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02341naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245017500170520093100345592002801276650001401304650002701318650001301345650001601358650002701374650001401401650001501415650002101430650001201451650001701463650000901480650000701489650002101496650001401517653001901531653002801550653001701578653001901595700005901614700002601673773010001699856008701799852000901886655001201895IND60647498420221120224902.0190726e20191115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064749842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2019.1250232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yingxin10aEffect of pH on the formation of electrostatic complexes between lentil protein isolate and a range of anionic polysaccharides, and their resulting emulsifying properties  aThis research investigated the effect of pH on forming electrostatic complexes between lentil protein isolate (LPI) and a range of anionic polysaccharides [carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), gum Arabic (GA), alginate (AL), and ι-carrageenan (CAR)] at 4:1 LPI-polysaccharide mixing ratio, and their resulting emulsifying abilities.

LPI-CAR emulsion displayed the highest emulsion stability (ES) because of its higher continuous phase and emulsion viscosities, lower mean droplet sizes, and negatively charged droplets. They also formed much smaller complexes within solution due to their high negative charge. All other LPI-polysaccharide systems formed less stable emulsions than LPI alone due to the larger sizes of both complexes and oil droplets.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalginates 3acarboxymethylcellulose 3adroplets 3aemulsifying 3aemulsifying properties 3aemulsions 3agum arabic 3aiota-carrageenan 3alentils 3amixing ratio 3aoils 3apH 3aprotein isolates 3aviscosity 0aLentil protein 0aAnionic polysaccharides 0aCoacervation 0aEmulsification1 aGhosh, Supratim1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8538-600X1 aNickerson, Michael T.0 tFood chemistry.g2019 Nov. 15, v. 298 p.125023-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2019.1250233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02246naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245009900169300001800268520103100286592002801317650000801345650001601353650001101369650002601380650001101406650002401417650001801441650001701459650002001476653003701496653001801533653001901551653002401570700002201594700001801616773012101634856008401755852000901839655001201848IND60122054220221118055607.0150324e20140803xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012205422DNAL7 a10.1080/09640568.2013.7958872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWillett, Keith10aPricing mechanisms for cap and trade policies: computer-assisted smart markets for air quality  ap. 1240-1251.  aThe process of calculating market clearing prices for cap and trade environmental pollution policies dealing with both air and water pollution remains problematic.

We aim to develop a modelling system that would be easy and efficient to operate. We use the method which is known as a computer-assisted ‘smart market’ and has been used in a number of electric energy pricing situations. This approach has also been proposed and applied to some types of environmental quality and resource management policies. In the paper the theoretical structure of the ‘smart market’ model is provided. After the review of different models that have been used to represent permit trading situations, the smart market model structure based on the shadow prices is developed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aair quality 3aenergy 3aenvironmental markets 3amodels 3aresource management 3ashadow prices 3atrade policy 3awater pollution 0aenvironmental pollution policies 0aair pollution 0apermit trading 0asmart market models1 aCaplanova, Anetta1 aSivak, Rudolf0 tJournal of environmental planning and management.g2014 Aug. 3, v. 57, no. 8 p.1240-1251dRoutledgex1360-05597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09640568.2013.7958873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02067naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002800147245015700175300001600332520093100348592002801279650001701307650001401324650002201338650001301360650000901373650001501382650001901397650001601416650001501432650001001447700002301457700002201480773011301502856008101615852000901696655001201705IND50089269320221118102044.0150214e200508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008926932DNAL7 a10.1007/s00217-005-1184-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBecker, Eleonora Miquel10aDeactivation of riboflavin triplet-excited state by phenolic antioxidants: mechanism behind protective effects in photooxidation of milk-based beverages  ap. 382-386.  aThe water-soluble plant polyphenols rutin, (+)-catechin, and (−)-epigallocatechin gallate were each found to be efficient quenchers for the triplet-excited state of riboflavin in aqueous solution using nano-second laser flash photolysis. The deactivation followed second-order kinetics with rates close to the diffusion control: (−)-epigallocatechin gallate (1.70±0.2×10⁹ l mol⁻¹ s⁻¹), (+)-catechin (1.44±0.04×10⁹ l mol⁻¹ s⁻¹), and rutin (9.7±0.2×10⁸ l mol⁻¹ s⁻¹) at 25 °C and pH = 6.8. No synergetic effects for mixtures of the phenolic compounds were found. Hydrogen atom transfer is calculated to be more exergonic than electron transfer, suggesting the hydrogen atom transfer mechanism to be operative. The efficient deactivation by the plant polyphenols makes this type of compounds of importance as protectors against light-induced oxidation in flavored milk-based beverages.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidants 3abeverages 3aelectron transfer 3ahydrogen 3amilk 3aphotolysis 3aphotooxidation 3apolyphenols 3ariboflavin 3arutin1 aCardoso, Daniel R.1 aSkibsted, Leif H.0 tEuropean food research & technology.g2005 Aug., v. 221, no. 3-4 p.382-386dSpringer-Verlagx1438-23777nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00217-005-1184-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02982naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005500147245010600202300001200308520162000320592002801940650001301968650002301981650001402004650001602018650001502034650002602049650001602075650001402091650001102105650001402116650001802130650001902148651001102167700004002178700003302218700003602251700003202287773015002319856008202469852000902551655001202560IND60593447620221120032425.0180904e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059344762DNAL7 a10.1007/s10661-018-6691-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ada Silva, Vicente Elício Porfiro Sales Gonçalves10aInfluence of sewage sludge, as a substrate, in the plasticity of functional characteristics of plants  ap. 307.  aThis work aimed to evaluate the effect of sewage sludge application as fertilizer on the plasticity of functional characteristics of species commonly found in the Caatinga. The research was developed in the nursery of the Federal Institute of Education, Science and Technology of Ceará (IFCE), Quixadá campus, located in northeastern Brazil. Three treatments were applied: raw sludge, sanitized sludge, and no manipulation. In each treatment, five species were planted, each with five individuals, totaling 75 individuals, which were tagged, and 4 months after germination, they were destroyed to obtain dry matter content (TMSF) from leaf, stem (TMSC), fine root (TMSRF), and thick root (TMSRG); leaf area; height and diameter of the seedling; and length above and below the ground. The sanitized sludge was responsible for giving higher values for leaf area, height of the seedlings, and diameter and length of stem and root. However, the dry matter content of the fine roots was higher in the treatment without manipulation. At the community level, as TMSRG increased, TMSC also increased, the same occurred between TMSRG and TMSRF, TMSC and TMSRF, and stem length and leaf area. In the treatment without manipulation, there was a positive correlation between leaf area, height and plant diameter, and negative correlation between root length and plant diameter. Thus, it can be concluded that the use of sanitized sludge is a good tool to increase the availability of soil resources, conferring to individuals’ greater dry matter content, greater leaf area, and higher height and diameter above the ground.  aPublisher supplied data 3acaatinga 3adry matter content 3aeducation 3afertilizers 3afine roots 3afunctional properties 3agermination 3aleaf area 3aleaves 3aseedlings 3asewage sludge 3asoil resources 3aBrazil1 aBuarque, Patrícia Marques Carneiro1 aFerreira, Wanessa Nepomuceno1 aBuarque, Hugo Leonardo de Brito1 aSilva, Maria Amanda Menezes0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2018 May, v. 190, no. 5 p.307-307dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl33242x0167-63697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-018-6691-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03211naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003700113040001800150100002700168245020500195300001600400520139500416592002801811650001301839650001701852650001301869650001701882650001401899650002001913650001701933650001701950650002201967650001401989650001202003650001202015650001802027650002702045650003302072650002502105650001402130650002502144650003902169650002002208650001402228650002702242651001302269651001102282651001102293651001102304700002502315700002102340700002902361700002902390773011002419856008302529852000902612655001202621IND60082775220221119042430.0141101e201111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008277522DNAL7 a218018422pmid7 a10.1016/j.ympev.2011.07.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPellegrino, Katia C.M.10aMolecular phylogeny, biogeography and insights into the origin of parthenogenesis in the Neotropical genus Leposoma (Squamata: Gymnophthalmidae): Ancient links between the Atlantic Forest and Amazonia  ap. 446-459.  aLeposoma is a conspicuous component of leaf litter herpetofauna of South and Central American rainforests. The 15 bisexual and one parthenogenetic species are allocated to the parietale and scincoides groups based on morphology. Phylogenetic analyses of 1830bp (mtDNA+nuclear) were performed on 63 specimens of four species from Amazonian and Panamanian rainforests, and six species and one undescribed form from the Atlantic Forest. Different methods of tree reconstruction were explored, with Anotosaura vanzolinia and Colobosauroides cearensis as outgroups. The monophyly of the parietale and scincoides groups is strongly supported. Contrary to previous hypotheses suggesting a recent contact between Atlantic and Amazon forests, our estimates point to an initial split in Miocene. The position of Leposoma baturitensis, endemic to relictual forests in the semiarid Caatingas northeastern Brazil, and its divergence from the remaining species of the Atlantic Forest, suggests an ancient isolation with no indication of a secondary contact with forests of the eastern coast. Our data do not permit unambiguous assignment of parental species of the unisexual Leposoma percarinatum or the mechanism involved in the origin of parthenogenesis, but revealed two highly divergent diploid and triploid lineages within L. percarinatum, indicating that the unisexuals represent a species complex.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSquamata 3abiogeography 3adiploidy 3aherpetofauna 3amonophyly 3aparthenogenesis 3aplant litter 3arain forests 3asecondary contact 3atriploidy 3atropics 2aAnimals 2aBayes Theorem 2aCell Nucleusxgenetics 2aDNA, Mitochondrialxgenetics 2aEvolution, Molecular 2aGeography 2aLikelihood Functions 2aLizardsxclassificationxgenetics. 2aParthenogenesis 2aPhylogeny 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 3aAmazonia 3aBrazil 0aBrazil 0aPanama1 aRodrigues, Miguel T.1 aJames Harris, D.1 aYonenaga-Yassuda, Yatiyo1 aSites, Jack W., Jr.cJr.0 tMolecular phylogenetics and evolution.g2011 Nov., v. 61, no. 2 p.446-459dElsevier Inc.x1055-79037nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ympev.2011.07.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01911naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245014100155300002000296520073100316592002801047650001101075650001101086650002501097650002101122650002201143650002201165650002201187650001401209650001201223700001901235700001501254700001401269700001701283700001701300773012501317856007401442852000901516655001201525IND60669176220221117082727.0190920e20151014xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066917622DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra13568k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Ruoxu10aCopper nanowires based current collector for light-weight and flexible composite silicon anode with high stability and specific capacity  ap. 87090-87097.  aA metal network fabricated by copper nanowires (CuNWs), synthesized in a facile way, is introduced to silicon composite anode as current collector for lithium-ion battery.

This paper proposes a method based on Support Vector Machine (SVM) to detect rotor mass imbalance for a multi-class imbalance problem, using the estimated speed as an input variable, obtained through a combination of electrical quantities (currents and voltages). Moreover, it is sought to obtain the magnitude of the rotor mass imbalance. With the aid of statistical tools, intermediate classes can be estimated, other than the ones proposed for the SVM. Besides, if the azimuth position is provided, the angular position of the mass imbalance can be also obtained. A 1.5 MW three-bladed wind turbine model with a permanent magnet synchronous generator, was considered, and a database was built numerically using the software Turbsim, FAST, and Simulink. From the database, the Power Spectral Density (PSD) technique was used to transform the input data from the time to the frequency domain. Then, the SVM algorithm and statistical analysis were used to classify the magnitude and the angular position of the imbalance. Different scenarios of mass imbalance were tested under different wind speeds and turbulence intensities.

In the present study, the production of solid callus and cell suspensions from hypocotyl explants of three different chili pepper cultivars (Capsicum annuum L. cv. Mazzolino, Capsicum chinense Jacq. cv. Naga Morich and Pimenta de Neyde), was optimised. In addition, C. chinense cv. Naga Morich cell suspensions were supplemented with biotic elicitors (methyl-jasmonate and chitosan) and with precursors and intermediates of capsaicin biosynthesis (vanillin, phenylalanine and valine), and both cells and media were analysed for capsaicinoid, polyphenol, flavonoid contents and for antioxidant activity. This is the first report regarding capsaicinoid elicitation with pure chitosan and with a combination of precursors of both phenylpropanoid and valine pathways. Overall, the highest capsaicinoid levels were detected in cell extracts from cultures treated with 10 μM methyl-jasmonate and with a combination of phenylalanine and valine amino acids (100 μM each). The present results confirm the possibility of using hypocotyl chili pepper cell suspensions to produce high amounts of health beneficial metabolites.  aPublisher supplied data  cItalian Ministry of Instruction, University and Research (MIUR)dhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100003407 3aCapsicum annuum 3aCapsicum chinense 3aPimenta 3aantioxidant activity 3abiosynthesis 3acallus 3acapsaicin 3acell suspension culture 3achitosan 3acolor 3acultivars 3aelicitors 3aexplants 3aflavonoids 3ahot peppers 3ahypocotyls 3ainflammation 3aliquids 3ametabolites 3amethyl jasmonate 3aodors 3aphenylalanine 3apolyphenols 3avaline 3avanillin 0aantioxidant activity 0acapsaicinoids 0acell cultures 0achili pepper 0aelicitors 0apolyphenols1 aGruarin, Nicolò1 aBarbieri, Federica1 aTassoni, Annalisa0 tPlant biosystems.g2018 May 4, v. 152, no. 3 p.436-444dTaylor & FranciswJournal:J000000133x1724-55757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/11263504.2017.13059983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01310naa a2200241 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075024003600099040001800135100002000153245005300173300001400226520053200240592002800772650001900800650001600819700002200835773010800857852000900965856008200974655001201056991560223780742620221120104320.0181030e197702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7790788712DNAL7 a10.1177/0040517577047002042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDegruy, Ines V.10aStructural Aspects of the Walls of Cateye Cotton  ap. 91-96.  aAspergillus flavus boll infection is revealed in a bright, greenish-yellow fluorescence of cotton seeds.

Alternatively, a performance-scaled rotor (PSR) is usually utilized. In the present study, a gradient-descent-based method, named as CCB-GD method is proposed to conduct the PSR design for FWT model testing in wave basins. Different from existing methods, the proposed method aims to mimic the radial distribution of normal aerodynamic loads along the blade, rather than the total thrust. This is achieved by combining the blade element momentum theory with gradient descent optimization algorithm. In the present design procedure, a new airfoil with good aerodynamic performance at low Reynolds number is first selected, the optimal radial distribution of twist angles and chord lengths are then determined separately and sequentially based on the gradient-descent optimization algorithm. Additionally, high-order Bezier curves are used to smooth the radial distribution of twist angle and chord length. The proposed method is demonstrated by two case studies, in which the PSR design of the NREL 5 MW wind turbine and the DTU 10 MW wind turbine are conducted and compared with existing methods. Results show that the present method can design the PSR with good accuracy. Besides, the present method is robust, generic and also applicable in the PSR design of MW-scale wind turbines for FWT model testing in the wave basin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aReynolds number 3aaerodynamics 3aalgorithms 3abasins 3amodels 3amomentum 3awind 3awind turbines 0aFloating wind turbine 0aModel testing 0aPerformance-scaled rotor 0aDesign method1 aCheng, Zhengshun1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7142-14251 aXiao, Longfei1 aTian, Xinliang1 aLiu, Mingyue1 aWen, Binrong0 tRenewable energy.g2022 Mar., v. 187 p.144-155dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2022.01.0683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02527naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001400152245011700166300001300283520103900296592002801335650001001363650001201373650001501385650002201400650000901422650001201431650001401443650002001457650002001477650002801497650001501525650002601540650001101566650001001577650002101587653001501608653002201623653002801645653002201673653001401695700001301709700001201722700001801734700001501752700002001767700001801787773009601805856008701901852000901988655001201997IND60635610420221119064919.0200503e20180530xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063561042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2017.12.0472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Zheng10aQuantitative phosphoproteomic analysis among muscles of different color stability using tandem mass tag labeling  ap. 8-15.  aA quantitative analysis of protein phosphorylation in ovine LTL muscle with different color stability was performed in the present study using TMT labeling in combination with TiO₂ phosphopeptide enrichment. A total of 3412 phosphopeptides assigned to 1070 phosphoproteins were identified by mass spectrometry, of which 243 proteins were detected to be differentially phosphorylated between muscles of different color stability. Among these differentially phosphorylated proteins, 27 phosphoproteins were identified to be key color-related proteins by informatics analysis. Proteins involved in carbohydrate metabolism, especially glycolytic enzymes, were the largest cluster of protein determined to be color-related. In addition, the phosphorylation of myoglobin at Ser133 plays a negative role in the regulation of meat color stability. In summary, this study revealed that the phosphorylation of some glycolytic enzymes and myoglobin at specific serine residues may play critical roles in the regulation of meat color stability.  aPublisher supplied data 3acolor 3aenzymes 3aglycolysis 3amass spectrometry 3ameat 3amuscles 3amyoglobin 3aphosphopeptides 3aphosphoproteins 3aprotein phosphorylation 3aproteomics 3aquantitative analysis 3aserine 3asheep 3atitanium dioxide 0aMeat color 0aPhosphoproteomics 0aCarbohydrate metabolism 0aGlycolytic enzyme 0aMyoglobin1 aLi, Meng1 aLi, Xin1 aXin, Jianzeng1 aWang, Ying1 aShen, Qingwu W.1 aZhang, Dequan0 tFood chemistry.g2018 May 30, v. 249 p.8-15dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2017.12.0473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03814naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001800171245009100189300001400280500002000294520185600314592002802170650001802198650002002216650002702236650002002263650002602283650001702309650000902326650001502335650001302350650001102363650001902374650002102393650002502414650002002439650001002459650002002469650001602489650001802505650001902523650002202542650002102564650002602585650001202611650002902623650001702652650003202669650001102701650001802712650002202730650002002752650002802772650002302800650002302823650003402846700001402880700001602894773013202910852000903042856008903051655001203140IND4438362820221119144644.0210530e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443836282DNAL7 a199584232pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-2672.2009.04626.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAkolkar, A.V.10aHalobacterium sp.

SP1(1) for the acceleration of fish sauce fermentation. Methods and Results: Traditional fish sauce fermentation was mimicked using Halobacterium sp. SP1(1) as starter culture. Protease activity, peptide release and α‐amino content (parameters used to monitor the progress of the fermentation) were high at day 10 in tests and day 20 in un‐inoculated controls. The total protein and nitrogen contents were also high in tests compared with controls. The amino acid profile observed at the end of fermentation in experimental samples, when compared with the commercial sauce preparation, was found to be better with respect to flavour and aroma contributing amino acids as well as essential amino acid lysine. Microflora analysis of the final fish sauce revealed the absence of any nonhalophilic or halotolerant micro‐organisms. The protease‐producing halophilic isolates obtained from the fish sauce of eviscerated and uneviscerated controls were identified as Halobacterium sp. F1 and F2, respectively, by 16S rDNA sequence analysis. Conclusions: Exogenous augmentation of Halobacterium sp. SP1(1) accelerated the fish sauce fermentation process with an additive effect on the existing natural microflora present in the fish during fermentation. Halobacterium sp SP1(1), therefore, can be used as an important starter culture for accelerating the fish fermentation process, which is attributed to its extracellular protease. Significance and Impact of the Study: The present study is the first report on use of Halobacterium species as a starter culture for accelerating fish sauce fermentation. Use of halobacterial starter cultures may revolutionize the process in fish sauce industries by reducing the fermentation time and making the process more economical with improved nutritive value of product.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHalobacterium 3aadditive effect 3aamino acid composition 3aenzyme activity 3aessential amino acids 3afermentation 3afish 3afish sauce 3aindustry 3alysine 3amicroorganisms 3anitrogen content 3anucleotide sequences 3anutritive value 3aodors 3aprotein content 3aproteinases 3aribosomal DNA 3asalt tolerance 3asequence analysis 3astarter cultures 2aAmino Acidsxanalysis 2aAnimals 2aEndopeptidasesxanalysis 2aFermentation 2aFish Productsxmicrobiology 2aFishes 2aFood Handling 2aFood Microbiology 2aFood Technology 2aHalobacteriumxgenetics 2aNitrogenxanalysis 2aProteinsxanalysis 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 16Sxgenetics1 aDurai, D.1 aDesai, A.J.0 tJournal of applied microbiology.g2010 July, v. 109, no. 1 p.44-53dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl54923x1364-50727nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2672.2009.04626.x3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02260naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245012700159300002000286520116900306592002801475650002301503650001801526650001901544650002101563650001601584650001901600650001301619650002001632650001601652700001701668700001801685773012401703856007401827852000901901655001201910IND60666922120221120040743.0190919e20141003xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066692212DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra10325d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYoon, Ki-Young10aPreparation of defect-free nanocaterpillars via in situ nanoparticlisation of a well-defined polyacetylene block copolymer  ap. 49180-49185.  aPreviously we reported a one-pot preparation of nano-objects resembling a caterpillar (nanocaterpillar) from polyacetylene (PA) diblock copolymers, via the in situ nanoparticlisation of conjugated polymers (INCP) approach. However, they showed the following limitations: micro-structure of PA block was stereo-random containing mixtures of E and Z polyenes, and their nanostructures were contaminated by nanosphere defects. Herein, we report strategies to prepare not only defect-free nanocaterpillars, but also the stereo-regular PA diblock copolymers. By altering the ROMP temperature, we can control the stereochemistry (E/Z) of the PA block, the degree of chain-transfer reaction and molar mass dispersity. As a result of a suppressed chain-transfer reaction at low temperature, ROMP of cyclooctatetraene (COT) at 0 °C produced defect-free nanocaterpillars containing cis-major PAs and they can be transformed into those containing trans-major PAs by thermal isomerisation. Compared to previously reported ill-defined block copolymers, these well-defined block copolymers lead to an increase in the length of nanocaterpillars and narrower length distribution.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomposite polymers 3aisomerization 3amicrostructure 3amolecular weight 3ananospheres 3apolyacetylenes 3apolyenes 3astereochemistry 3atemperature1 aLee, In-Hwan1 aChoi, Tae-Lim0 tRSC advances.g2014 Oct. 03, v. 4, no. 90 p.49180-49185dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ra10325d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02850naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002300145245011400168300002000282520140800302592002801710650001301738650002101751650004901772650001901821650001801840650000901858650002201867650001101889650000701900650001501907650001301922651001201935700002101947700002001968700001901988700002202007700002302029700006402052700006402116773013602180856007902316852000902395655001202404IND60708013820221117210701.0200821e20200723xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070801382DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.0c005572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSanzhaeva, Urikhan10aSynthesis, Characterization, and Application of a Highly Hydrophilic Triarylmethyl Radical for Biomedical EPR  ap. 10388-10398.  aStable tetrathiatriarylmethyl radicals have significantly contributed to the recent progress in biomedical electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) due to their unmatched stability in biological media and long relaxation times. However, the lipophilic core of the most commonly used structure (Finland trityl) is responsible for its interaction with plasma biomacromolecules, such as albumin, and self-aggregation at high concentrations and/or low pH. While Finland trityl is generally considered inert toward many reactive radical species, we report that sulfite anion radical efficiently substitutes the three carboxyl moieties of Finland trityl with a high rate constant of 3.53 × 10⁸ M–¹ s–¹, leading to a trisulfonated Finland trityl radical. This newly synthesized highly hydrophilic trityl radical shows an ultranarrow linewidth (ΔBₚₚ = 24 mG), a lower affinity for albumin than Finland trityl, and a high aqueous solubility even at acidic pH. Therefore, this new tetrathiatriarylmethyl radical can be considered as a superior spin probe in comparison to the widely used Finland trityl. One of its potential applications was demonstrated by in vivo mapping oxygen in a mouse model of breast cancer. Moreover, we showed that one of the three sulfo groups can be easily substituted with S-, N-, and P-nucleophiles, opening access to various monofunctionalized sulfonated trityl radicals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalbumins 3abreast neoplasms 3aelectron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy 3ahydrophilicity 3alipophilicity 3amice 3aorganic chemistry 3aoxygen 3apH 3asolubility 3asulfites 3aFinland1 aPoncelet, Martin1 aTseytlin, Oxana1 aTseytlin, Mark1 aGencheva, Marieta1 aEubank, Timothy D.1 aKhramtsov, Valery V.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6187-55461 aDriesschaert, Benoit1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1402-413X0 tJournal of organic chemistry.g2020 July 23, v. 85, no. 16 p.10388-10398dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19181x1520-69047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.joc.0c005573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02488naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245014200169300001600311520105100327592002801378650002501406650001301431650002701444650002401471650004401495650002501539650001001564650002601574650001701600650001501617653003501632653001201667653001101679653001701690653003101707700001401738700001501752700001601767700001501783700001801798773012101816856008401937852000902021655001202030IND60122353120221120232527.0150325e20140703xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012235312DNAL7 a10.1080/10934529.2014.8937942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Manhong10aRemoval performance and changes in the microbial communities of SBRs under aerobic and anoxic conditions with trace tetracycline pressure  ap. 940-947.  aThe reactor performance and microbial community composition of sequencing batch reactor (SBR) under aerobic and anoxic conditions were investigated in this study. The experimental results showed high chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiency. The tetracycline (TC) removal efficiencies were not obviously affected by aerobic and anoxic conditions, and were 64–97 and 60–87%, respectively. Aerobic condition was observed to be more suitable for decreasing tetracycline‐resistant bacteria (TRB) than anoxic condition in synthetic and real wastewater. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and clone library analysis revealed that Chlorobaculumthiosulfatiphilum was the dominant species in the tested SBR systems. TC significantly influenced the relative numbers of TRB‐ and TC‐resistant genes, and the microbial community diversity changed with the addition of 250 μg L ⁻¹ of TC. The genes of tet A and tet C, tet M and tet S, tet A and tet M, tet S and tet A showed significant correlation with each other (P < 0.05).  aPublisher supplied data 3aanaerobic conditions 3abacteria 3achemical oxygen demand 3acommunity structure 3adenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis 3aenvironmental health 3agenes 3amicrobial communities 3atetracycline 3awastewater 0aSequencing batch reactor (SBR) 0aaerobic 0aanoxic 0atetracycline 0aresistance characteristics1 aXiao, Bin1 aZhang, Wei1 aHuang, Zhen1 aMa, Yukun,1 aChen, Donghui0 tJournal of environmental science and health.g2014 July 3, v. 49, no. 8 p.940-947dTaylor & Francisx1532-41177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10934529.2014.8937943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02436naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002700149245008400176300001600260520116600276592002801442650001501470650004901485650001701534650000901551650002001560650003101580650001001611650001201621650001701633653000901650653000801659653001401667653001101681653001801692653001001710700003201720700002101752700002401773773011301797856008301910852000901993655001202002IND60599053020221120095440.0180702e20140815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059905302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ydbio.2014.05.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFernandes, Vilaiwan M.10aNemo promotes Notch-mediated lateral inhibition downstream of proneural factors  ap. 334-343.  aDuring neurogenesis, conserved tissue-specific proneural factors establish a cell׳s competence to take on neural fate from within a field of unspecified cells. Proneural genes encode basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors that promote the expression of ‘core’ and subtype-specific target genes. Target genes include both pan-neuronal genes and genes that aid in the process of refinement, known as lateral inhibition. In this process, proneural gene expression is increased in the neural progenitor while simultaneously down-regulated in the surrounding cells, in a Notch signalling-dependent manner. Here, we identify nemo (nmo) as a target of members of both Drosophila Atonal and Achaete-Scute proneural factor families and find that mammalian proneural homologs induce Nemo-like-kinase (Nlk) expression in cell culture. We find that nmo loss of function leads to reduced expression of Notch targets and to perturbations in Notch-mediated lateral inhibition. Furthermore, Notch hyperactivity can compensate for nmo loss in the Drosophila eye. Thus nmo promotes Notch-mediated lateral inhibition downstream of proneural factors during neurogenesis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDrosophila 3abasic helix-loop-helix transcription factors 3acell culture 3aeyes 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3amammals 3aneurogenesis 0aNemo 0aNLK 0aProneural 0aAtonal 0aAchaete-Scute 0aNotch1 aPanchapakesan, Shanker S.S.1 aBraid, Lorena R.1 aVerheyen, Esther M.0 tDevelopmental biology.g2014 Aug. 15, v. 392, no. 2 p.334-343dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12382x0012-16067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ydbio.2014.05.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02493naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001800144245014900162300002000311520106100331592002801392650000801420650002501428650001601453650001101469650001801480650002201498650002601520650001601546650001701562653001701579653000801596653001001604653000901614653001501623653001501638700002101653700002001674700002001694700002001714700002201734700002001756700001901776773012701795856008001922852000902002655001202011IND60579971420221118010358.0170907e20170906xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057997142DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.7b070662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSatyal, Uttam10aInterfacially Engineered Pyridinium Pseudogemini Surfactants as Versatile and Efficient Supramolecular Delivery Systems for DNA, siRNA, and mRNA  ap. 29481-29495.  aThis article presents the synthesis, self-assembly, and biological activity as transfection agents for pDNA, siRNA, and mRNA of novel pyridinium pseudogemini surfactants, interfacially engineered from the most efficient gemini surfactants and lipids generated in our amphiphile research program. Formulation of novel amphiphiles in water revealed supramolecular properties very similar to those of gemini surfactants, despite their lipidlike charge/mass ratio. This dual character was found also to enhance endosomal escape and significantly increase the transfection efficiency. We were also successful in identifying the parameters governing the efficient delivery of pDNA, siRNA, and mRNA, drawing valuable structure–activity and structure–property relationships for each nucleic acid type, and establishing DNA/siRNA/mRNA comparisons. Several supramolecular complexes identified in this study proved to be extremely efficient nucleic acid delivery systems, displaying excellent serum stability and tissue penetration in three-dimensional organoids.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3abioactive properties 3ablood serum 3alipids 3amessenger RNA 3aresearch programs 3asmall interfering RNA 3asurfactants 3atransfection 0atransfection 0aDNA 0asiRNA 0amRNA 0aamphiphile 0apyridinium1 aDraghici, Bogdan1 aDragic, Lisa L.1 aZhang, Qiangnan1 aNorris, Kyle W.1 aMadesh, Muniswamy1 aBrailoiu, Eugen1 aIlies, Marc A.0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2017 Sept. 06, v. 9, no. 35 p.29481-29495dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.7b070663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03517naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002200125024001900147040001800166100001800184245013900202300001800341500001500359506007600374520165900450592002802109506003702137650001102174650002802185650002302213650002002236650001402256650001602270650001002286650001902296650001402315650001802329650000802347650001202355650001202367650000902379650000902388650002502397650001202422650002702434650002202461650001202483653001602495653002002511653001402531653001902545653001702564653002402581700001802605700001802623700001702641700002002658773011302678856007902791852000902870655001202879IND60515060820221207085905.0160312e20151201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051506082DNAL7 a10.1089/jmf.2015.34432doi7 aPMC46854952pmcid7 a262911702pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Joo Youn10aIlex latifolia Prevents Amyloid β Protein (25–35)-Induced Memory Impairment by Inhibiting Apoptosis and Tau Phosphorylation in Mice  ap. 1317-1326.  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIlex latifolia Thunb. (Aquifoliaceae), a Chinese bitter tea called “kudingcha,” has been widely consumed as a health beverage and found to possess antioxidant, antidiabetic, antihypertensive, anti-inflammatory, and anti-ischemic activities. The aim of the present study was to investigate the neuroprotective effects of an ethanol extract of I. latifolia against amyloid β protein (Aβ)-induced memory impairment in mice and neurotoxicity in cultured rat cortical neurons. Memory impairment in mice was induced by intracerebroventricular injection of 15 nmol Aβ (25–35) and measured by the passive avoidance test and Morris water maze test. Chronic administration of I. latifolia (25–100 mg/kg, p.o.) significantly prevented Aβ (25–35)-induced memory loss. I. latifolia also prevented the decrease of glutathione concentrations, increased lipid peroxidation, expression of phosphorylated tau (p-tau), and changes in apoptosis-associated proteins in the memory-impaired mouse brain. Exposure of cultured cortical neurons to 10 μM Aβ (25–35) for 36 h induced neuronal apoptotic death. The neuronal cell death, elevation of intracellular Ca²⁺ concentration, generation of reactive oxygen species, and expression of proapoptotic proteins caused by Aβ (25–35) in the cultured neurons were inhibited by treatment with I. latifolia (1–50 μg/mL). These results suggest that I. latifolia may have a possible therapeutic role in managing cognitive impairment associated with Alzheimer's disease. The underlying mechanism might involve the antiapoptotic effects mediated by antioxidant activity and inhibition of p-tau formation.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3amemory 3areactive oxygen species 3alipid peroxidation 3aphosphorylation 3abeverages 3aglutathione 3abrain 3aIlex latifolia 3aapoptosis 3aneurotoxicity 3atea 3aneurons 3acalcium 3amice 3arats 3aantioxidant activity 3aethanol 3aneuroprotective effect 3aAlzheimer disease 3aamyloid 0aantioxidant 0aneuroprotection 0acognition 0aCa2+ signaling 0aantioxidants 0aAlzheimer's disease1 aLee, Hong Kyu1 aJang, Ji Yeon1 aYoo, Jae Kuk1 aSeong, Yeon Hee0 tJournal of medicinal food.g2015 Dec. 01, v. 18, no. 12 p.1317-1326dMary Ann Liebert, Inc.x1557-76007nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1089%2Fjmf.2015.34433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02415naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245017100171300001600342520110700358592002801465650001401493650001401507650001901521650001501540650002201555650002401577650002101601650000901622653001701631653001301648653003401661653002101695653001501716700001801731700001801749700001701767700001801784773009701802856008501899852000901984655001201993IND60554409920221119101222.0161024e20140101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055440992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jchromb.2013.11.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiao, Chuanrong12aA HPLC–MS/MS method for the simultaneous quantitation of six alkaloids of Rhizoma Corydalis Decumbentis in rat plasma and its application to a pharmacokinetic study  ap. 101-106.  aA specific and reliable HPLC–MS/MS method was developed and validated for the simultaneous determination of six alkaloids in rat plasma, jatrorrhizine, berberine, tetrahydropalmatine, protopine, bicuculline and palmatine. The analytes were separated on a C18 column (50mm×2.1mm, 1.8μm) and a triple-quadrupole mass spectrometry equipped with an electrospray ionization (ESI) source was used for detection. The plasma sample was prepared by the simple protein precipitation and the recovery for the six analytes was over 80%. The calibration curves were linear over a concentration range of 0.38–1900.0ng/mL for jatrorrhizine, 0.57–2850.0ng/mL for berberine, 0.32–1600.0ng/mL for tetrahydropalmatine, 0.21–1050.0ng/mL for protopine, 0.34–1700.0ng/mL for bicuculline and 0.22–1100ng/mL for palmatine. The intra-day and inter-day precision was less than 15% and the relative error (RE) was all within ±15%. The validated method was successfully applied to a pharmacokinetics study in rats after oral administration of the extracts of Rhizoma Corydalis Decumbentis (a famous Chinese herb).  aPublisher supplied data 3aCorydalis 3aberberine 3achromatography 3aionization 3amass spectrometry 3aoral administration 3apharmacokinetics 3arats 0aHPLC–MS/MS 0aAlkaloid 0aRhizoma Corydalis Decumbentis 0aPharmacokinetics 0aRat plasma1 aZhang, Sheng,1 aYin, Shiliang1 aWang, Zhibin1 aMeng, Yonghai0 tJournal of Chromatography B.g2014 Jan. 01, v. 944 p.101-106dElsevier B.V.x1570-02327nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jchromb.2013.11.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02267naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100001900135245002900154300001400183520141700197592002801614650001301642650001101655650001301666650000901679650001001688650001501698650001401713650001201727650001101739650001001750650001701760773009301777856003801870852000901908655001201917IND4478915420221120133111.0120619s2012    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447891542DNAL7 a10.1071/IS110412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNielsen, Claus10aHow to make a protostome  ap. 25-40.  aThe origin and radiation of the major metazoan groups can be elucidated by phylogenomic studies, but morphological evolution must be inferred from embryology and morphology of living organisms. According to the trochaea theory, protostomes are derived from a holoplanktonic gastraea with a circumblastoporal ring of downstream-collecting compound cilia (archaeotroch) and a nervous system comprising an apical ganglion and a circumblastoporal nerve ring. The pelago-benthic life cycle evolved through the addition of a benthic adult stage, with lateral blastopore closure creating a tube-shaped gut. The archaeotroch became differentiated as prototroch, metatroch and telotroch in the (trochophora) larva, but was lost in the adult. The apical ganglion was lost in the adult, as in all neuralians. Paired cerebral ganglia developed from the first micromere quartet. The circumblastoporal nerve became differentiated into a pair of ventral nerve cords with loops around mouth (the anterior part of the blastopore) and anus. Almost all new information about morphology and embryology fits the trochaea theory. The predicted presence of a perioral loop of the blastoporal nerve ring has now been demonstrated in two annelids. Alternative ‘intercalation theories’ propose that planktotrophic larvae evolved many times from direct-developing ancestors, but this finds no support from considerations of adaptation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnnelida 3aadults 3aancestry 3aanus 3acilia 3aembryology 3aevolution 3aganglia 3alarvae 3amouth 3anerve tissue0 tInvertebrate systematics.g2012, v. 26, no. 1 p.25-40dCSIRO Publishingx1445-52267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/IS11041  aDNAL 7aarticle02880naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001900144245007700163300002000240520148300260592002801743650001501771650001101786650001001797650001501807650002301822650001901845650001501864653002301879653002501902653002601927653003301953653002401986653001402010653001002024653001102034700001502045700002002060700002202080700002202102700002002124700002002144700001802164773012702182856008002309852000902389655001202398IND60579971720221118010332.0170907e20170906xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057997172DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.7b070922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoida, Takashi10aCu(In,Ga)Se2 Solar Cells with Amorphous In2O3-Based Front Contact Layers  ap. 29677-29686.  aAmorphous (a-) In₂O₃-based front contact layers composed of transparent conducting oxide (TCO) and transparent oxide semiconductor (TOS) layers were proved to be effective in enhancing the short-circuit current density (Jₛc) of Cu(In,Ga)Se₂ (CIGS) solar cells with a glass/Mo/CIGS/CdS/TOS/TCO structure, while maintaining high fill factor (FF) and open-circuit voltage (Vₒc). An n-type a-In–Ga–Zn–O layer was introduced between the CdS and TCO layers. Unlike unintentionally doped ZnO broadly used as TOS layers in CIGS solar cells, the grain-boundary(GB)-free amorphous structure of the a-In–Ga–Zn–O layers allowed high electron mobility with superior control over the carrier density (N). High FF and Vₒc values were achieved in solar cells containing a-In–Ga–Zn–O layers with N values broadly ranging from 2 × 10¹⁵ to 3 × 10¹⁸ cm–³. The decrease in FF and Vₒc produced by the electronic inhomogeneity of solar cells was mitigated by controlling the series resistance within the TOS layer of CIGS solar cells. In addition, a-In₂O₃:H and a-In–Zn–O layers exhibited higher electron mobilities than the ZnO:Al layers conventionally used as TCO layers in CIGS solar cells. The In₂O₃-based layers exhibited lower free carrier absorption while maintaining similar sheet resistance than ZnO:Al. The TCO and TOS materials and their combinations did not significantly change the Vₒc of the CIGS solar cells and the mini-modules.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3acopper 3aglass 3amolybdenum 3aphotovoltaic cells 3asemiconductors 3azinc oxide 0aphotovoltaic cells 0aphotovoltaic modules 0achalcopyrite compound 0atransparent conducting oxide 0aoxide semiconductor 0aamorphous 0aIn2O3 0aa-IGZO1 aUeno, Yuko1 aNishinaga, Jiro1 aHiguchi, Hirohumi1 aTakahashi, Hideki1 aIioka, Masayuki1 aShibata, Hajime1 aNiki, Shigeru0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2017 Sept. 06, v. 9, no. 35 p.29677-29686dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.7b070923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03336naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100006100192245008100253300001800334506007600352520162500428592002802053596011202081596008102193596007402274596006502348506003702413650001302450650001502463650001902478700003102497700002202528700002402550700001702574700001902591700002502610700002302635700001702658773012002675856008602795852000902881655001202890IND60624925420221207103308.0191017e20180401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062492542DNAL7 a10.1093/bioinformatics/btx7522doi7 aPMC60308262pmcid7 a291863512pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFabregat, Antonio1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3288-859910aReactome diagram viewer: data structures and strategies to boost performance  ap. 1208-1214.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aReactome is a free, open-source, open-data, curated and peer-reviewed knowledgebase of biomolecular pathways.

While detection (testing) of eQTL associations has been widely studied, less work has been devoted to the estimation of eQTL effect size. To reduce false positives, detection methods frequently rely on linear modeling of rank‐based normalized or log‐transformed gene expression data. Unfortunately, these approaches do not correspond to the simplest model of eQTL action, and thus yield estimates of eQTL association that can be uninterpretable and inaccurate. In this article, we propose a new, log‐of‐linear model for eQTL action, termed ACME, that captures allelic contributions to cis‐acting eQTLs in an additive fashion, yielding effect size estimates that correspond to a biologically coherent model of cis‐eQTLs. We describe a non‐linear least‐squares algorithm to fit the model by maximum likelihood, and obtain corresponding p‐values. We perform careful investigation of the model using a combination of simulated data and data from the Genotype Tissue Expression (GTEx) project. Our results reveal little evidence for dominance effects, a parsimonious result that accords with a simple biological model for allele‐specific expression and supports use of the ACME model. We show that Type‐I error is well‐controlled under our approach in a realistic setting, so that rank‐based normalizations are unnecessary. Furthermore, we show that such normalizations can be detrimental to power and estimation accuracy under the proposed model. We then show, through effect size analyses of whole‐genome cis‐eQTLs in the GTEx data, that using standard normalizations instead of ACME noticeably affects the ranking and sign of estimates.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aalgorithms 3abiometry 3agene expression 3agenomics 3agenotype 3aleast squares 3alinear models 3amedicine 3aquantitative trait loci1 aShabalin, Andrey1 aZhou, Yi‐Hui1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4092-74631 aNobel, Andrew B.1 aWright, Fred A.0 tBiometrics.g2018 June, v. 74, no. 2 p.616-625dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl16956x0006-341X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/biom.128103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02452naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002700140245008900167300001800256520120200274592002801476650002301504650001501527650001601542650002001558650001401578650001401592650002101606700002001627700002701647700002201674700002001696700002201716700002101738700002301759700002001782700002701802773012901829856007501958852000902033655001202042IND60657898420221118214357.0190823e20150924xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065789842DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ay01866h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMalsagova, Kristina A.12aA SOI-nanowire biosensor for the multiple detection of D-NFATc1 protein in the serum  ap. 8078-8085.  aThe detection of cancer protein marker D-NFATc1 in the serum with a reusable nanowire (NW) chip based on silicon-on-insulator (SOI) structures was demonstrated. The NW surface was modified with aptamers against D-NFATc1 to attain the biospecific detection of the target protein. Two fabricated NW chip types – with narrow NWs (w = 90 nm) and wide NWs (w = 3 μm) – were compared with respect to their reuse, i.e. the realizability of the repeated detection–regeneration cycles upon D-NFATc1 detection in the serum. The analysis of the serum has shown that the signal obtained with wide NWs was much more stable than that obtained with narrow NWs. This makes the SOI-NW biosensor with wide NWs much more suitable for protein analysis in biological fluids. The signal stability exhibited by the wide NWs allowed for performing repeated detection–regeneration cycles of this chip for multiple detection of D-NFATc1 protein in the serum with 10⁻¹⁴ M sensitivity. Although the narrow NW chip allows for attaining higher sensitivity (with the concentration detection limit DL = 10⁻¹⁵ M), it exhibits much less signal stability upon analysis of multicomponent biological fluids (serum).  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical methods 3abiosensors 3ablood serum 3adetection limit 3ananowires 3aneoplasms 3aoligonucleotides1 aIvanov, Yuri D.1 aPleshakova, Tatyana O.1 aKaysheva, Anna L.1 aShumov, Ivan D.1 aKozlov, Andrey F.1 aArchakov, A.

Harvesting fruits and vegetables is the most labor-intensive and time-consuming among the main agricultural tasks. However, seasonal labor shortage of experienced workers results in low efficiency of harvesting, food losses, and quality deterioration. Therefore, research efforts focus on the automation of manual harvesting operations. Robotic manipulation of delicate products in unstructured environments is challenging. The development of suitable end effectors that meet manipulation requirements is necessary. To that end, this work reviews the state-of-the-art robotic end effectors for harvesting applications. Detachment methods, types of end effectors, and additional sensors are discussed. Performance measures are included to evaluate technologies and determine optimal end effectors for specific crops. Challenges and potential future trends of end effectors in agricultural robotic systems are reported. Research has shown that contact-grasping grippers for fruit holding are the most common type of end effectors. Furthermore, most research is concerned with tomato, apple, and sweet pepper harvesting applications. This work can be used as a guide for up-to-date technology for the selection of suitable end effectors for harvesting robots.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural industry 3aagriculture 3aapples 3aautomation 3afruits 3alabor 3arobots 3asweet peppers 3atomatoes1 aTsakalidou, Viktoria Nikoleta1 aKalathas, Ioannis 1 aGkrimpizis, Theodoros 1 aPachidis, Theodore 1 aKaburlasos, Vassilis G.0 tAgriculture (Basel).g2022 Aug. 17, v. 12, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12387x2077-04727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agriculture120812403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02791naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245013200171300001400303520132900317592002801646650002201674650002001696650001801716650000801734650002201742650002401764650001401788650001401802650002001816650002201836650001201858650001201870650001501882650001101897650001001908653002601918653002401944653001201968653001401980653004401994700001702038700002002055700002002075773010702095856008602202852000902288655001202297IND60628453520221120141502.0190410e20190405xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062845352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2018.12.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKang, Seok-Beom10aDevelopment of molecular markers for the early detection of scion roots in Shiranuhi Mandarin hybrid and other citrus cultivars  ap. 14-19.  aRecently, scion rooting at the grafted region of Poncirus trifoliata rootstocks has been found to decrease fruit setting and quality. Under cultivation conditions, the identification of scion-rooted Shiranuhi mandarin hybrid [(Citrus unshiu Marcov. × C. sinensis Osbeck) × C. reticulata Blanco] trees is difficult. Therefore, we aimed to develop a novel method for rapid and accurate identification of scion roots based on sequence-related amplified polymorphism (SRAP) in combination with a sequence-characterized amplified region (SCAR) marker. The genomic DNA was extracted from the normal rootstocks of P. trifoliata and scion roots of Shiranuhi. The sequence of amplified DNA fragments from scion root samples was analyzed using SRAP F4 and R15 primer combination, and was used to construct nine combinations of SCAR primers. Five markers (P1, P2, P3, P4, and P6) were obtained, of which SCAR-P3 presented the best results. We also efficiently screened the scion roots in Kiyomi and Settokka. These SCAR markers accurately identified scion rooting in Shiranuhi mandarin hybrid and other citrus cultivars, thus allowing the implementation of improved cultivation techniques to ensure normal fruit setting. The proposed method can also be applied to control the damage caused by scion rooting in other Citrus cultivars.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCitrus reticulata 3aCitrus sinensis 3aCitrus unshiu 3aDNA 3aDNA fragmentation 3aPoncirus trifoliata 3acultivars 3afruit set 3agenetic markers 3agrafting (plants) 3ahybrids 3arooting 3arootstocks 3ascions 3atrees 0aCultivation technique 0aPoncirus trifoliata 0aQuality 0aRootstock 0aSequence-related amplified polymorphism1 aYun, Su-Hyun1 aMoon, Young-Eel1 aJin, Seong-Beom0 tScientia horticulturae.g2019 Apr. 05, v. 248 p.14-19dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4108x0304-42387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2018.12.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02960naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245010300171520198200274592002802256650001602284650001502300650001002315650002002325650001102345650001102356700001702367700001802384700001802402773013302420856008402553852000902637655001202646IND60790784820221119143942.0220826e20220817xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079078482DNAL7 a10.3390/agriculture120812422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Chuandong 10aGrape Cluster Real-Time Detection in Complex Natural Scenes Based on YOLOv5s Deep Learning Network  aDue to differences in planting environment, color, shape, size, and compactness, accurate detection of grape clusters is very difficult. Herein, a real-time detection method for grape clusters based on the YOLOv5s deep learning algorithm was proposed. More specifically, a novel dataset called Grape-internet was constructed, which consisted of 8657 grape images and corresponding annotation files in complex scenes. By training and adjusting the parameters of the YOLOv5s model on the data set, and by reducing the depth and width of the network, the lightweight processing of the network was completed, losing only a small amount of accuracy. As a result, the fast and accurate detection of grape clusters was finally realized. The test results showed that the precision, recall, mAP and F1 of the grape cluster detection network were 99.40%, 99.40%, 99.40% and 99.40%, respectively, and the average detection speed per image was 344.83 fps, with a model size of 13.67 MB. Compared with the YOLOv5x, ScaledYOLOv4-CSP and YOLOv3 models, the precision of YOLOv5s was 1.84% higher than that of ScaledYOLOv4-CSP, and the recall rate and mAP were slightly lower than three networks by 0.1–0.3%. The speed was the fastest (4.6 times, 2.83 times and 6.7 times of YOLOv3, ScaledYOLOv4-CSP and YOLOv5x network, respectively) and the network scale was the smallest (1.61%, 6.81% and 8.28% of YOLOv3, ScaledYOLOv4-CSP YOLOv5x, respectively) for YOLOv5s. Moreover, the detection precision and recall rate of YOLOv5s was 26.14% and 30.96% higher, respectively, than those of Mask R-CNN. Further, it exhibited more lightweight and better real-time performance. In short, the detection network can not only meet the requirements of being a high precision, high speed and lightweight solution for grape cluster detection, but also it can adapt to differences between products and complex environmental interference, possessing strong robustness, generalization, and real-time adaptability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagriculture 3aalgorithms 3acolor 3adata collection 3agrapes 3amodels1 aDing, Huali 1 aShi, Qinfeng 1 aWang, Yunfei 0 tAgriculture (Basel).g2022 Aug. 17, v. 12, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12387x2077-04727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agriculture120812423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03144naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006800151245013800219300001600357520169600373592002802069650001102097650001502108650001202123650001202135650002002147650001002167650002202177650002702199650001302226650001902239650001302258650001102271650001002282653001802292653001802310653001402328653001202342653002502354653000902379700006402388700001802452773010902470856008602579852000902665655001202674IND60628453620221120141414.0190725e20190315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062845362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2018.12.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJafari Malekabadi, Ayoub1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5128-497710aComparison of block-based stereo and semi-global algorithm and effects of pre-processing and imaging parameters on tree disparity map  ap. 264-274.  aOne method of creating a 3D model of a tree is stereo vision technique. Tree geometric characteristics have been used to predict yield, fertilizer application in citrus crops, water consumption or biomass. So, a disparity map and 3D model of the tree can be useful. There are different algorithms to match the stereo pair for calculating disparity maps. Many parameters affect the disparity map, such as the lighting that affects camera and imaging parameters, the calibration that needed to rectify the image, etc. In this study, the block-based stereo and semi-global algorithms with 5 implementations were compared to calculate tree disparity maps. Also, the effects of ISO speed, exposure time, metering mode (imaging parameters) and image un-distortion and rectification (pre-processing) were investigated. The results showed that the semi-global algorithm was better than the block-based stereo algorithm. Windows size affected on disparity maps and best results obtained when this parameter was set to default. Maximum disparity value limits search space. Best results obtained in real value. For smaller value than real value, disparity map was not calculated outside that maximum disparity. Therefore, disparities or pixels missed. It observed that image rectifying, ISO speed, exposure time and metering mode were affected on disparity map. When pictures did not rectify, disparity map calculated but with some errors. Camera parameters were affected on light intensity of pictures. Best disparity map obtained in conditions that ISO speed and exposure time had fewer value and metering mode was set to pattern mode and these parameters were similar for both left and right images.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCitrus 3aalgorithms 3abiomass 3acameras 3acomputer vision 3acrops 3aexposure duration 3afertilizer application 3ageometry 3aimage analysis 3alighting 3amodels 3atrees 0aDisparity map 0aExposure time 0aISO speed 0aRectify 0aSemi-global matching 0aTree1 aKhojastehpour, Mehdi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8107-90261 aEmadi, Bagher0 tScientia horticulturae.g2019 Mar. 15, v. 247 p.264-274dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4108x0304-42387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2018.12.0333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03365naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001700143245013000160300001500290520161500305592002801920650002201948650003101970650002202001650001602023650002102039650002102060650001702081650002102098650001802119650001802137650001502155650002402170650000902194650003702203650001302240650001602253650002402269650003602293650003202329653002202361653002202383653002202405653001302427700001902440700001702459700001702476700001602493700001802509700001702527700001502544700001902559773010902578856007902687852000902766655001202775IND60515061320221120152622.0160315e20160101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051506132DNAL7 a10.1089/jmf.2015.34892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Jaehong10aTopical Application of Angelica sinensis Improves Pruritus and Skin Inflammation in Mice with Atopic Dermatitis-Like Symptoms  ap. 98-105.  aAngelica sinensis (AS) is one of the most popular medicinal foods used as a hematopoietic herb and also traditionally applied topically for skin disorders. However, the effectiveness of AS on atopic dermatitis (AD) has not been reported yet. This study was conducted to evaluate the antipruritic and anti-inflammatory effects of AS on regulating AD-related mediators in DNCB (2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene)-induced mice. AS was topically applied to the dorsal skin of DNCB-challenged mice for 11 days. Alteration of skin thickness was measured for assessment of histological improvement. In addition, the number of mast cells, the level of serum immunoglobulin E (IgE), the counting of scratching behavior, and the expression of substance P were evaluated. Also, the expressions of cytokines, nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), phospho-IκBα, and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) were measured for evaluating the improvement of skin inflammation. The repeated treatment of AS significantly inhibited the skin thickness, the number of mast cells, and the level of serum IgE. Moreover, AS significantly suppressed the increased scratching behavior and the expression of substance P compared to the DNCB group. Topical application of AS also reduced the level of cytokines (IL-4, IL-6, TNF-α, and IFN-γ) as well as the expressions of NF-κB, phospho-IκBα, and phospho-MAPKs in the dorsal skin. The results of our study suggest that topical application of AS might have efficacy for modulating pruritus and inflammation in AD. Further studies are required to further characterize the mechanism of actions of AS.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAngelica sinensis 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3aatopic dermatitis 3ablood serum 3afunctional foods 3aimmunoglobulin E 3ainflammation 3ainterferon-gamma 3ainterleukin-4 3ainterleukin-6 3amast cells 3amechanism of action 3amice 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3apruritus 3asubstance P 3atopical application 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 0aAngelica sinensis 0aanti-inflammation 0aatopic dermatitis 0apruritus1 aChoi, You Yeon1 aKim, Mi-hye,1 aHan, Jae Min1 aLee, Ji Eun1 aKim, Eun-hye,1 aHong, Jongki1 aKim, Jinju1 aYang, Woong Mo0 tJournal of medicinal food.g2016 Jan. 01, v. 19, no. 1 p.98-105dMary Ann Liebert, Inc.x1557-76007nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1089%2Fjmf.2015.34893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02900naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245012700158300001600285500002000301520157600321592002801897596006401925596002601989650003002015650001502045650002002060650001302080650001002093650001102103650001402114650001302128700002602141700002202167700005902189700006202248773011002310856007302420852000902493655001202502IND60613413920221120085007.0180912e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061341392DNAL7 a10.1111/eth.128052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoran, Ines G.10aQuiet violence: Savannah Sparrows respond to playback‐simulated rivals using low‐amplitude songs as aggressive signals  ap. 724-732.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aWhen animals compete over resources such as breeding territories, they often use signals to communicate their aggressive intentions. By studying which signals are associated with aggressive interactions, we gain a deeper appreciation of animal behaviour. We studied aggressive signalling in male Savannah Sparrows, Passerculus sandwichensis, focusing on signals that precede physical attack against territorial intruders. We simulated intruders using song playback and taxidermic models, and we determined which behaviours were associated with physical attack. Previous studies that have used this approach suggest that many species produce songs of dramatically lower amplitude, or “soft songs,” as signals of aggressive intention. Savannah Sparrows, however, are not known to produce soft songs, and therefore, they provided an interesting system for testing signals that predict attack. Of 93 playback subjects, 23 males attacked the simulated intruder and 70 did not. To our surprise, Savannah Sparrows produced soft songs, and the number of soft songs was a significant predictor of attack on the simulated intruder. Birds also showed a nonsignificant tendency to produce more “chip” calls prior to attack on the simulated intruder, whereas three other measured behaviours (aggressive calls, wing waving and passes over the model) did not predict attack. Our study contributes to the growing body of research on aggressive territorial signals and reveals that soft song is an even more widespread signal of aggression in songbirds than previously recognized.  aPublisher supplied data  cNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada  cUniversity of Windsor 3aPasserculus sandwichensis 3aaggression 3aanimal behavior 3abreeding 3amales 3amodels 3asongbirds 3aviolence1 aDoucet, Stéphanie M.1 aNewman, Amy E.

The chemical control of Aedes spp., which is usually implemented, affects both humans and the environment. The biological control of Aedes spp. with entomopathogenic bacteria such as Photorhabdus and Xenorhabdus may be an alternative method that can overcome such issues. This study aimed to isolate and identify Photorhabdus and Xenorhabdus bacteria from entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) collected in Thailand and evaluate their larvicidal properties in controlling A. aegypti and A. albopictus. Colony morphology and recA sequencing of the 118 symbiotic isolated bacteria indicated that most were P. luminescens subsp. akhurstii and X. stockiae with minor prevalence of P. luminescens subsp. hainanensis, P. asymbiotica subsp. australis, X. indica, X. griffiniae, X. japonica, X. thuongxuanensis, and X. eapokensis. The larvicidal bioassay with the third- and fourth-instar mosquito larvae suggested that a whole-cell suspension of X. griffiniae (bMSN3.3_TH) had the highest efficiency in eradicating A. aegypti and A. albopictus, with 90 ± 3.71% and 81 ± 2.13% mortality, respectively, after 96 h exposure. In contrast, 1% of ethyl acetate extracted from X. indica (bSNK8.5_TH) showed reduced mortality for A. aegypti of only 50 ± 3.66% after 96 h exposure. The results indicate that both X. griffiniae (bMSN3.3_TH) and X. indica (bSNK8.5_TH) could be used as biocontrol agents against Aedes larvae  aPublisher supplied data 3aAedes aegypti 3aAedes albopictus 3aDengue virus 3aPhotorhabdus 3aXenorhabdus 3aarboviruses 3abioassays 3abiological control 3achemical control 3aentomopathogenic nematodes 3aethyl acetate 3alarvicides 3amortality 3aThailand 0aAedes 0aBiological control 0aEntomopathogenic bacteria 0aLarvicidal activity 0aPhylogeny1 aArdpairin, Jiranun1 aDumidae, Abdulhakam1 aJanthu, Pichamon1 aMuangpat, Paramaporn1 aPolseela, Raxsina1 aTandhavanant, Sarunporn1 aThanwisai, Aunchalee1 aVitta, Apichat0 tActa tropica.g2022 Nov., v. 235 p.106668-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl44799x0001-706X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actatropica.2022.1066683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02962naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001700094024002300111024003900134024001200173040001800185100002100203245008900224300001800313506017300331520133100504592002801835650001901863650002201882650001101904650002201915650001301937650002201950700001301972700006201985700001802047773012002065856008602185856011402271956014502385961001302530852000902543655001202552IND60624925720221214225005.0191017e20180415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062492572DNAL7 a3270922aris7 a10113/62492572hdl7 a10.1093/bioinformatics/btx7552doi8 ans14329  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKeel, Brittney N10aMOCASSIN-prot: a multi-objective clustering approach for protein similarity networks  ap. 1270-1277.  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aProteins often include multiple conserved domains. Various evolutionary events including duplication and loss of domains, domain shuffling, as well as sequence divergence contribute to generating complexities in protein structures, and consequently, in their functions. The evolutionary history of proteins is hence best modeled through networks that incorporate information both from the sequence divergence and the domain content. Here, a game-theoretic approach proposed for protein network construction is adapted into the framework of multi-objective optimization, and extended to incorporate clustering refinement procedure. The new method, MOCASSIN-prot, was applied to cluster multi-domain proteins from ten genomes. The performance of MOCASSIN-prot was compared against two protein clustering methods, Markov clustering (TRIBE-MCL) and spectral clustering (SCPS). We showed that compared to these two methods, MOCASSIN-prot, which uses both domain composition and quantitative sequence similarity information, generates fewer false positives. It achieves more functionally coherent protein clusters and better differentiates protein families.

Herein, iron single-atom catalysts with different coordination structures of FeN₂C₂ and FeN₃P are constructed to selectively catalyze the detection of As(III) in the coexistence of Cu(II). FeN₃P achieves a high sensitivity of 3.90µA ppb⁻¹ toward As(III) in NH₄Cl/NH₃·H₂O electrolyte (pH 8.0), completely avoiding Cu(II)-interference. Moreover, the turnover frequency (TOF) of FeN₃P is an order of magnitude higher than that of FeN₂C₂. X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that an As-O bond of H₃AsO₃ is broken by the strong affinities between both P and O atoms and Fe and As atoms, and H₃AsO₃ are preferentially reduced by FeN₃P during adsorptive process. Meanwhile, the low reaction energy barrier of the rate-determined step for As(III) reduction over FeN₃P also accelerates the deposition of As(III) and enhances its response signals. The free-Cu(II) are difficult to adsorb on FeN₃P and do not compete with As(III) for Fe active sites, which contributes to the excellent anti-Cu(II) interference capability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray absorption spectroscopy 3adensity functional theory 3aelectrolytes 3aenergy 3aheavy metals 3apH 3awater quality analysis 0aArsenic 0aCopper 0aContaminant detection 0aFe single-atom catalysts 0aElectrochemical analysis1 aSong, Zong-Yin1 aXiao, Xiang-Yu1 aLiang, Bo1 aYang, Meng1 aChen, Shi-Hua1 aLiu, Wen-Qing1 aHuang, Xing-Jiu0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2022 Oct. 02,  p.130122-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.130122  aDNAL 7aarticle02599naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004200113040001800155100002000173245004200193300001600235520140800251592002801659650001501687650001001702650002701712650001601739650001901755650001701774650001601791650001301807650003501820650002301855650002701878650002801905650003101933700001901964700002001983773012202003856005502125852000902180655001202189IND50065331420221118005422.0130419e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006533142DNAL7 a230460732pmid7 a10.1111/j.1744-7909.2012.01175.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMathur, Jaideep10aOrganelle Extensions in Plant CellsF   ap. 851-867.  aCell walls lock each cell in a specific position within the supra‐organization of a plant. Despite its fixed location, each cell must be able to sense alterations in its immediate environment and respond rapidly to ensure the optimal functioning, continued growth and development, and eventual long‐term survival of the plant. The ultra‐structural detail that underlies our present understanding of the plant cell has largely been acquired from fixed and processed material that does not allow an appreciation of the dynamic nature of sub‐cellular events in the cell. In recent years, fluorescent protein‐aided imaging of living plant cells has added to our understanding of the dynamic nature of the plant cell. One of the major outcomes of live imaging of plant cells is the growing appreciation that organelle shapes are not fixed, and many organelles extend their surface transiently in rapid response to environmental stimuli. In many cases, the extensions appear as tubules extending from the main organelle. Specific terms such as stromules from plastids, matrixules from mitochondria, and peroxules from peroxisomes have been coined to describe the extensions. Here, we review our present understanding of organelle extensions and discuss how they may play potential roles in maintaining cellular homeostasis in plant cells.

Understanding interactions between plant–pollinator networks and how they change over time is particularly important within agricultural systems, such as apples, that flower en masse and that also contain non-crop co-flowering species both within the farm and the surrounding landscape. We determined the degree of overlap between pollinator networks on two varieties of apple (Granny Smith and Pink Lady) and co-flowering plant species within orchards and the wider vegetation matrix in two apple-growing regions (Orange and Bilpin) in Australia. We surveyed plant–pollinator interactions at key stages of the cropping cycle: before mass flowering; during king, peak and late blooms; and, finally, once apple flowering had finished. Overall, we found considerable overlap in the flower visitor assemblage on apples and co-flowering species within the orchard. The introduced honeybee (Apis mellifera) was the most frequent flower visitor to all three vegetation types at all times in Orange. However, in Bilpin, both a native stingless bee (Tetragonula carbonaria) and A. mellifera were highly frequent visitors, both on- and off-crop. Numerous native bees, flies and Lepidoptera also commonly visited apple and co-flowering species within orchards in both locations. We found that native-bee and honeybee visitation to apple flowers was positively correlated with co-flowering species richness (within the orchard and the wider matrix); however, visitation by native bees decreased as the area of co-flowering species in the surrounding landscape increased. Our study highlights the importance of maintaining diverse co-flowering plant communities within the local landscape to increase and support a wide variety of pollinators in horticultural production systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aApis mellifera 3aLepidoptera 3aTetragonula carbonaria 3aagriculture 3aapples 3afarms 3ahorticulture 3alandscapes 3aorchards 3apollinators 3aspecies richness 3astingless bees 3avegetation 3aAustralia1 aKobel, Conrad 1 aBrettell, Laura E.1 aO’Brien, Corey 1 aCook, James M.1 aPower, Sally A.0 tAgriculture (Basel).g2022 Aug. 17, v. 12, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12387x2077-04727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agriculture120812463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02802naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245009700165300001600262520125100278592002801529650001601557650001701573650002101590650002201611650001801633650001901651650001601670650002401686650001001710650002601720650001201746650002401758650001201782650004301794650000901837650001601846650001901862650001101881650002201892650001001914653001001924653001901934653000901953653000901962700001501971700001501986700001502001700002002016773012102036856008202157852000902239655001202248IND60533031320221120114800.0160728e20140718xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053303132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2014.06.0552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiang, Wenji10aFunction of wheat Ta-UnP gene in enhancing salt tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis and rice  ap. 794-801.  aBased on microarray analysis results of the salt tolerant wheat mutant, we identified and cloned an unknown salt-induced gene Ta-UnP (Triticum aestivum unknown protein). Quantitative PCR results revealed that Ta-UnP expression was induced not only by salt but also by polyethylene glycol, abscisic acid, and other environmental stress factors. Under salt stress, transgenic Arabidopsis plants that overexpressed Ta-UnP showed superior physiological properties (content of proline, soluble sugar, MDA, and chlorophyll) compared with the control. Subcellular localization demonstrated that Ta-UnP was mainly localized on the cell membrane. The expressions of nine salt tolerance-related genes of Arabidopsis in Ta-UnP-overexpressed Arabidopsis were analyzed via qPCR, and the results revealed that the expressions of SOS2, SOS3, RD29B, and P5CS were significantly up-regulated, whereas the other five genes only slightly changed. The results of the salt tolerance analysis indicated that Ta-UnP can enhance the salt tolerance of transgenic rice plants, and RNAi transgenic rice plants became highly susceptible to salt stress. The results from this study indicate that this novel Ta-UnP may be useful in improving of plant tolerance to salt stress.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3aOryza sativa 3aRNA interference 3aTriticum aestivum 3aabscisic acid 3acell membranes 3achlorophyll 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3amicroarray technology 3amutants 3apolyethylene glycol 3aproline 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arice 3asalt stress 3asalt tolerance 3asugars 3atransgenic plants 3awheat 0aWheat 0aSalt tolerance 0aqPCR 0aRNAi1 aCui, Weina1 aMa, Xiaoli1 aWang, Gang1 aHuang, Zhanjing0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2014 July 18, v. 450 p.794-801dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2014.06.0553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03509naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245013400166520164200300592002801942650002101970650001801991650001702009650001702026650001602043650001002059650001402069650001302083650003102096650001202127650001302139650001702152650002202169650002002191653001102211653002602222653002902248653002802277653002202305653001802327653000802345653000802353653000802361653000802369653000802377653000902385653000802394653000902402700001502411700005702426700001802483700002002501700001702521700001402538700001402552700001602566700001602582700001802598700001502616773010902631856008602740852000902826655001202835IND60743793520221120100402.0211206e20211015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074379352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2021.1103692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDing, Feng10aComparative transcriptome analysis to identify fruit coloration-related genes of late-ripening litchi mutants and their wild type  aLitchi (Litchi chinensis Sonn.) is an important subtropical fruit crop with high economic and nutritional values. Fruit coloration is a sign of litchi fruit ripening and an important external quality traits. Two continuous generations of mutants, named MS1 and MS2, originally derived from cultivar ‘Heli’, exhibited the distinctive characteristic of late maturation of 20 d, with observable delays in coloration. The present study aimed to understand the mechanism underlying maturation difference between ‘Heli’ and its two mutants. An RNA-seq analysis revealed 6,145 differentially expressed genes, mostly identified at the color-breaking stage. The maximum expression levels of some genes involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis and chlorophyll degradation were delayed in the pericarp of the mutants compared with in the original cultivar. Generally, they peaked at earlier stages (S2/S3) in ‘Heli’, compared with later stages (S4/S5) in mutants. Moreover, some hormonal signal receptors, especially those involved in abscisic and ethylene signaling pathways, were also differentially expressed between the original cultivar and the mutant. Transcription factors, including MYB, bHLH, bZIP, and WRKY, correlated with anthocyanin biosynthesis, chlorophyll degradation and abscisic acid signal pathways were identified. The late pigmentation in mutants was related to the fruit ripening program, a complex and comprehensive process. Additionally, we identified novel candidate genes that are involved in the regulation of litchi fruit pigmentation of and gained significant insights into the process of litchi fruit ripening.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLitchi chinensis 3aabscisic acid 3aanthocyanins 3abiosynthesis 3achlorophyll 3acolor 3acultivars 3aethylene 3agene expression regulation 3amutants 3apericarp 3apigmentation 3asequence analysis 3atranscriptomics 0aLitchi 0aLate-ripening mutants 0aAnthocyanin biosynthesis 0aChlorophyll degradation 0aHormone signaling 0aTranscriptome 0apao 0anyc 0aabf 0aabi 0agst 0aufgt 0aPPH 0aRCCR1 aLi, Haoran1 aZhang, Shuwei1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6267-14731 aWang, Jinying1 aPeng, Hongxiang1 aChen, Houbin1 aHu, Fuchu1 aLai, Biao1 aMa, Wuqiang1 aLi, Jianguo1 aZhao, Minglei1 aHe, Xinhua0 tScientia horticulturae.g2021 Oct. 15, v. 288 p.110369-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4108x0304-42387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2021.1103693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03609naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245010200166300001800268520194700286592002802233650001502261650001502276650001002291650001202301650002202313650001902335650002102354650001002375650000902385650001502394650001802409650001902427650001402446650001502460650001602475653000902491653001002500653001002510653001002520653000802530653001002538653001002548653000802558653000902566653000702575653001902582653001502601653001002616653003302626653002202659700006002681700001902741700002102760773012302781856008202904852000902986655001202995IND60533031520221120114913.0160728e20140801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053303152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2014.06.0572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChun, Jong T.10aEarly events of fertilization in sea urchin eggs are sensitive to actin-binding organic molecules  ap. 1166-1174.  aWe previously demonstrated that many aspects of the intracellular Ca2+ increase in fertilized eggs of starfish are significantly influenced by the state of the actin cytoskeleton. In addition, the actin cytoskeleton appeared to play comprehensive roles in modulating cortical granules exocytosis and sperm entry during the early phase of fertilization. In the present communication, we have extended our work to sea urchin which is believed to have bifurcated from the common ancestor in the phylogenetic tree some 500 million years ago. To corroborate our earlier findings in starfish, we have tested how the early events of fertilization in sea urchin eggs are influenced by four different actin-binding drugs that promote either depolymerization or stabilization of actin filaments. We found that all the actin drugs commonly blocked sperm entry in high doses and significantly reduced the speed of the Ca2+ wave. At low doses, however, cytochalasin B and phalloidin increased the rate of polyspermy. Overall, certain aspects of Ca2+ signaling in these eggs were in line with the morphological changes induced by the actin drugs. That is, the time interval between the cortical flash and the first Ca2+ spot at the sperm interaction site (the latent period) was significantly prolonged in the eggs pretreated with cytochalasin B or latrunculin A, whereas the Ca2+ decay kinetics after the peak was specifically attenuated in the eggs pretreated with jasplakinolide or phalloidin. In addition, the sperm interacting with the eggs pretreated with actin drugs often generated multiple Ca2+ waves, but tended to fail to enter the egg. Thus, our results indicated that generation of massive Ca2+ waves is neither indicative of sperm entry nor sufficient for cortical granules exocytosis in the inseminated sea urchin eggs, whereas the structure and functionality of the actin cytoskeleton are the major determining factors in the two processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAsteroidea 3aEchinoidea 3aactin 3acalcium 3acortical granules 3acytochalasin B 3adepolymerization 3adrugs 3aeggs 3aexocytosis 3alatent period 3amicrofilaments 3aphylogeny 3apolyspermy 3aspermatozoa 0aPIP2 0aInsP3 0acADPr 0aNAADP 0aRFU 0aCYT-B 0aLAT-A 0aJAS 0aPHAL 0aFE 0aCortical flash 0aPolyspermy 0aActin 0aCortical granules exocytosis 0aCalcium signaling1 aLimatola, Nunzia1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5863-99991 aVasilev, Filip1 aSantella, Luigia0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2014 Aug. 01, v. 450 p.1166-1174dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2014.06.0573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02743naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245009900168300001800267520164900285592002801934650001301962650001501975650001901990650002302009650002202032650002002054650001402074650002202088650002502110700002402135700001902159773012002178856008602298852000902384655001202393IND60624926220221122040148.0191017e20180415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062492622DNAL7 a10.1093/bioinformatics/btx7602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aProbst, Dan,10aFUn: a framework for interactive visualizations of large, high-dimensional datasets on the web  ap. 1433-1435.  aDuring the past decade, big data have become a major tool in scientific endeavors. Although statistical methods and algorithms are well-suited for analyzing and summarizing enormous amounts of data, the results do not allow for a visual inspection of the entire data. Current scientific software, including R packages and Python libraries such as ggplot2, matplotlib and plot.ly, do not support interactive visualizations of datasets exceeding 100 000 data points on the web. Other solutions enable the web-based visualization of big data only through data reduction or statistical representations. However, recent hardware developments, especially advancements in graphical processing units, allow for the rendering of millions of data points on a wide range of consumer hardware such as laptops, tablets and mobile phones. Similar to the challenges and opportunities brought to virtually every scientific field by big data, both the visualization of and interaction with copious amounts of data are both demanding and hold great promise. Here we present FUn, a framework consisting of a client (Faerun) and server (Underdark) module, facilitating the creation of web-based, interactive 3D visualizations of large datasets, enabling record level visual inspection. We also introduce a reference implementation providing access to SureChEMBL, a database containing patent information on more than 17 million chemical compounds. The source code and the most recent builds of Faerun and Underdark, Lore.js and the data preprocessing toolchain used in the reference implementation, are available on the project website (http://doc.gdb.tools/fun/).  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3aalgorithms 3abioinformatics 3achemical compounds 3acomputer software 3adata collection 3adatabases 3amobile telephones 3astatistical analysis1 aReymond, Jean-Louis1 aWren, Jonathan0 tBioinformatics.g2018 Apr. 15, v. 34, no. 8 p.1433-1435dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl56649x1460-20597nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btx7603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02642naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245010100164506011700265506007600382520116800458592002801626506003701654650001501691650001701706650001601723650001201739650001301751650002001764650000701784650001501791650001801806650001601824653002701840653002101867653001601888653001601904653001501920653001701935700001801952700001601970773010801986856008102094852000902175655001202184IND60791496820221207073455.0220914e20221015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079149682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ab.2022.1148702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVogel, Ulrike12aA colorimetric assay for the screening and kinetic analysis of nucleotide sugar 4,6-dehydratases  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aNucleotide sugar 4,6-dehydratases belong to the Short-chain Dehydrogenase/Reductase (SDR) superfamily and catalyze the conversion of an NDP-hexose to an NDP-4-keto-6-deoxy hexose, a key step in the biosynthesis of a plethora of deoxy and amino sugars. Here, we present a colorimetric assay for the detection of their reaction products (NDP-4-keto-6-deoxy hexoses) using concentrated sulfuric acid and an ethanolic resorcinol solution. Under these conditions, the keto-function of the dehydratase product reacts specifically with resorcinol to form an orange-red or pink complex for NDP-glucose/GDP-mannose and UDP-N-acetylglucosamine, respectively, with an absorption maximum at 510 nm. The presented assay allows reliable product detection at low concentrations and can be applied in microtiter plates. It thus allows the determination of kinetic enzyme parameters like the optimal temperature, pH, Vmax, KM and kcat, as well as the miniaturization for screening purposes with crude cell extracts. As such, this detection assay opens new possibilities for the characterization and screening of these dehydratases in 96-well plates for different research goals.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aabsorption 3abiosynthesis 3acolorimetry 3ahexoses 3akinetics 3aoxidoreductases 3apH 3aresorcinol 3asulfuric acid 3atemperature 0aColorimetric detection 0aNucleotide sugar 0aDeoxysugars 0aDehydratase 0aEnzymology 0aBiocatalysis1 aBeerens, Koen1 aDesmet, Tom0 tAnalytical biochemistry.g2022 Oct. 15, v. 655 p.114870-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11652x0003-26977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ab.2022.1148703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03679naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100001800169245008300187300001600270520168300286592002801969650001901997650001602016650003102032650001402063650001102077650001002088650001102098650001602109650001702125650001202142650002402154650001602178650000902194650001002203650001702213650001202230650004302242650002802285650004502313650003202358650001502390650001102405650002302416650005002439650003802489650007502527650000902602650002402611650004102635650003102676650003502707700002002742700002002762700002002782773011102802856008402913990002302997852000903020655001203029IND60097844320221118040911.0141104e20120229xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009784432DNAL7 a222228202pmid7 a10.1016/j.ejphar.2011.12.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aInoue, Masako10aCarbocisteine promotes phagocytosis of apoptotic cells by alveolar macrophages  ap. 173-179.  aClearance of apoptotic cells, so-called efferocytosis, by alveolar macrophages (AMs) is important for lung homeostasis and is impaired in pulmonary inflammatory diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma. Carbocisteine, a mucoregulatory drug, corrects the contents of fucose in airway mucus and has anti-inflammatory properties in airway inflammation. Thus, we conducted the present study to better understand the anti-inflammatory properties of carbocisteine. First, we induced airway inflammation in mice with lipopolysaccharide intratracheally. Carbocisteine significantly decreased neutrophil numbers in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid at the resolution phase of inflammation, implying the promotion of neutrophil clearance. Then, we investigated whether carbocisteine would enhance the efferocytosis by AMs isolated from mice and found that this drug promoted not only the phagocytosis but also the binding of apoptotic cells to AMs in vitro. Furthermore, carbocisteine decreased the fucose residues stained with fluorescent fucose-binding lectin, Lens culinaris agglutinin, on the cell surface of AMs. We found here that removing fucose residues from cell surfaces of AMs by fucosidase markedly enhanced both the binding and phagocytosis of apoptotic cells. Finally, AMs from mice orally given carbocisteine also promoted both the binding and phagocytosis ex vivo similarly to in vitro. These results suggest that carbocisteine could promote the clearance of apoptotic cells by AMs in airway. In addition, the present findings suggest that the binding and phagocytosis of apoptotic cells may be modulated by fucose residues on the cell surface of AMs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLens culinaris 3aagglutinins 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3aapoptosis 3aasthma 3adrugs 3afucose 3ahomeostasis 3ainflammation 3alectins 3alipopolysaccharides 3amacrophages 3amice 3amucus 3aphagocytosis 2aAnimals 2aAnti-Inflammatory Agentsxpharmacology 2aApoptosisxdrug effects 2aBronchoalveolar Lavage Fluidximmunology 2aCarbocysteinexpharmacology 2aCell Count 2aFemale 2aFucosexmetabolism 2aInflammationxchemically inducedximmunology. 2aLipopolysaccharidesxpharmacology 2aMacrophages, Alveolarxcytologyxdrug effectsximmunologyxmetabolism. 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred BALB C 2aNeutrophilsxcytologyxdrug effects. 2aPhagocytosisxdrug effects 2aalpha-L-Fucosidasexmetabolism1 aIshibashi, Yuji1 aNogawa, Hisashi1 aYasue, Tokutaro0 tEuropean journal of pharmacology.g2012 Feb. 29, v. 677, no. 1-3 p.173-179dElsevier B.V.x0014-29997nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejphar.2011.12.0263Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02583naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006600139245007600205300001600281500002000297520133200317592002801649596003001677596006801707650001001775650002101785650001401806650000901820650001401829650002601843650001001869650001001879650001401889650001401903650001701917650001001934700003701944773011001981856007302091852000902164655001202173IND60613414520221120073243.0180912e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061341452DNAL7 a10.1111/eth.128032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBiagolini‐Jr, Carlos1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3699-333710aEgg ejection cost can limit defence strategies against brood parasitism  ap. 719-723.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aA cost associated with the evolution of antiparasite strategies is the failure to recognize parasitic eggs, leading the host to evict its own eggs. However, there is evidence that birds recognize their own eggs through imprinting. This leads to the question of why birds accept parasitic eggs if such eggs can be identified. Here, we tested whether egg ejection per se can be costly due to increased predation risk to the remaining clutch and whether olfactory or visual cues of egg ejection increase predation. We carried out three field experiments to answer the following questions: (a) Does ejecting an egg increase nest predation risk? (b) Does the presence of olfactory cues, such as the smell of a broken egg, increase nest predation risk? And (c) Does the presence of visual cues, such as an egg shell below the nest, increase nest predation risk? We found evidence that egg ejection increases nest predation and that olfactory cues alone also increase nest predation. The presence of visual cues did not change predation rates. These data indicate that egg ejection is costly for both host and parasitic eggs that may remain in the nest. Our results suggest why host and parasite eggs are commonly found within the same nests, despite the possibility that hosts recognize and could possibly eject the parasite’s egg.  aPublisher supplied data  cUniversidade de Brasília  cCoordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior 3abirds 3abrood parasitism 3aegg shell 3aeggs 3aevolution 3afield experimentation 3ahosts 3anests 3aparasites 3apredation 3arisk factors 3asmell1 ados Santos, Paulo Victor Resende0 tEthology.g2018 Oct., v. 124, no. 10 p.719-723dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl39008x0179-16137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/eth.128033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02292naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245007600171300001400247520137500261592002801636653001701664653000901681653002401690653001101714653002701725653002301752700002101775773010301796856008201899852000901981655001201990IND60554731320221120052415.0161024e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055473132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijpp.2015.07.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDabbs, Gretchen R.10aSlot-type fractures of the scapula at New Kingdom Tell El-Amarna, Egypt  ap. 12-22.  aAmarna is the archaeological representation of Akhetaten, the short-lived Egyptian capital city of Akhenaten (reign 1352-1336BCE).Five adult males excavated from the South Tombs Cemetery (STC) (total n>400) at Amarna exhibit slot-type fracture lesions of the scapula, and two of these lesions exhibit evidence of active bone remodeling at the time of death.The lesions in question are described and a full differential diagnosis is considered.The differential diagnosis rules out atrophic perforations, scapular foramina, tumors, and occupational and accidental trauma.Given the location, morphology, and surrounding bony changes, these lesions are consistent with sharp force trauma, specifically stabbing.These lesions most likely represent the consequence of corporal punishment in the form of “strokes” accompanied by “open wounds” known from Egyptian literature for punishment of a wide range of civil and criminal activities.Alternatively, several pigs at Amarna show similar wound morphologies of the cranium and scapulae, which have been interpreted by other authors to represent ritualized punishment of the god Seth, who is often represented as a pig.The lesions described here are consistent in morphology and positioning with the swine examples, and may represent further, cross-species, evidence of ritualized punishment at the ancient capital city.  aPublisher supplied data 0a18th Dynasty 0aSeth 0aCorporal punishment 0aRitual 0aDifferential diagnosis 0aSharp force trauma1 aZabecki, Melissa0 tInternational Journal of Paleopathology.g2015 Dec., v. 11 p.12-22dElsevier Inc.x1879-98177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpp.2015.07.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02133naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245010200168300001400270520119400284592002801478653001901506653001601525653002501541653003001566653001001596653000901606700002201615773010301637856008201740852000901822655001201831IND60554731420221120052458.0161024e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055473142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijpp.2015.08.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTitelbaum, A.R.12aA rare case of os odontoideum from an Early Intermediate period tomb at the Huacas de Moche, Peru  ap. 23-29.  aOs odontoideum is an uncommon vertebral anomaly where there is a smoothly corticated ossicle independent from a shortened odontoid peg. An example of os odontoideum was observed in an Early Intermediate period skeleton excavated from the Huacas de Moche (Moche IV, AD 400–700), Peru. The affected individual is a middle adult male who presents additional minor developmental anomalies of the axial skeleton. This individual was interred with a middle adult female who also has developmental anomalies of the axial skeleton, including block cervical vertebra (Klippel–Feil). Os odontoideum is infrequently reported in the medical literature and there continues to be debate about whether it is acquired or congenital. Unlike clinical cases, archaeological cases present an opportunity to examine the entirety of the skeleton. In the present case, there does not appear to be macroscopic or radiographic evidence for a healed fracture, and since the individual has multiple minor axial developmental anomalies, a congenital etiology is plausible. This case is the first to be described from the archaeological context of South America and one of few paleopathological examples worldwide.  aPublisher supplied data 0aOs odontoideum 0aTorticollis 0aCongenital anomalies 0aEarly Intermediate period 0aMoche 0aPeru1 aCastillo, S.Uceda0 tInternational Journal of Paleopathology.g2015 Dec., v. 11 p.23-29dElsevier Inc.x1879-98177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpp.2015.08.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02670naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100007400140245013100214300001600345500002000361520142500381592002801806650001501834650001301849650001001862650001501872650002101887650002101908650002101929650001101950650001301961650001501974650001201989700002302001700003002024700002502054773011002079856007402189852000902263655001202272IND60598232120221117163746.0180628e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059823212DNAL7 a10.1111/biom.128142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAndrinopoulou, Eleni‐Rosalina1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7886-410310aImproved dynamic predictions from joint models of longitudinal and survival data with time‐varying effects using P‐splines  ap. 685-693.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIn the field of cardio‐thoracic surgery, valve function is monitored over time after surgery. The motivation for our research comes from a study which includes patients who received a human tissue valve in the aortic position. These patients are followed prospectively over time by standardized echocardiographic assessment of valve function. Loss of follow‐up could be caused by valve intervention or the death of the patient. One of the main characteristics of the human valve is that its durability is limited. Therefore, it is of interest to obtain a prognostic model in order for the physicians to scan trends in valve function over time and plan their next intervention, accounting for the characteristics of the data. Several authors have focused on deriving predictions under the standard joint modeling of longitudinal and survival data framework that assumes a constant effect for the coefficient that links the longitudinal and survival outcomes. However, in our case, this may be a restrictive assumption. Since the valve degenerates, the association between the biomarker with survival may change over time. To improve dynamic predictions, we propose a Bayesian joint model that allows a time‐varying coefficient to link the longitudinal and the survival processes, using P‐splines. We evaluate the performance of the model in terms of discrimination and calibration, while accounting for censoring.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomarkers 3abiometry 3adeath 3adurability 3aechocardiography 3ahuman cell lines 3amodel validation 3amodels 3apatients 3aprediction 3asurgery1 aEilers, Paul H.

The existing methods, such as simulation and SNP-aware alignment, are either inaccurate or relatively slow. To fast and accurately count allelic reads for ASE analysis, we developed a novel approach, ASElux, which utilizes the personal SNP information and counts allelic reads directly from unmapped RNA-sequence (RNA-seq) data. ASElux significantly reduces runtime by disregarding reads outside single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) during the alignment. When compared to other tools on simulated and experimental data, ASElux achieves a higher accuracy on ASE estimation than non-SNP-aware aligners and requires a much shorter time than the benchmark SNP-aware aligner, GSNAP with just a slight loss in performance. ASElux can process 40 million read-pairs from an RNA-sequence (RNA-seq) sample and count allelic reads within 10 min, which is comparable to directly counting the allelic reads from alignments based on other tools. Furthermore, processing an RNA-seq sample using ASElux in conjunction with a general aligner, such as STAR, is more accurate and still ∼4× faster than STAR + WASP, and ∼33× faster than the lead SNP-aware aligner, GSNAP, making ASElux ideal for ASE analysis of large-scale transcriptomic studies. We applied ASElux to 273 lung RNA-seq samples from GTEx and identified a splice-QTL rs11078928 in lung which explains the mechanism underlying an asthma GWAS SNP rs11078927. Thus, our analysis demonstrated ASE as a highly powerful complementary tool to cis-expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analysis.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) represent a family of small noncoding RNAs controlling translation and transcription of many genes. The human miR-29 family of miRNAs has three mature members, miR-29a, miR-29b, and miR-29c. Recent studies have revealed that miR-29 is involved in regulation of the innate and adaptive immune responses. However, the function of miR-29 in the immune response to IAV infection remains to be further explored. Our previous study has shown that miR-29 family members are up-regulated during IAV infection, especially miR-29c. Here we report that miR-29c is involved in inhibition of IAV-induced innate immune responses. We found that posttranscriptional regulation was involved in IAV-induced A20 expression in A549 cells. Consistent with a previous report, miR-29c functionally protected A20 transcripts in A549 cells. Overexpression of miR-29c with miR-29c mimic enhanced IAV-induced A20 protein expression and conversely that miR-29c inhibitor significantly blocked IAV-induced A20 protein expression in A549 cells. Furthermore, functional results showed that IAV-induced miR-29c expression correlated with decreased NF-κB activity and expression of several antiviral and proinflammatory cytokines via up-regulation of A20. Together, the findings indicate a new role of miR-29c in IAV infection and suggest its induction may contribute to counteract the innate immune response.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInfluenza A virus 3aadaptive immunity 3acytokines 3aepithelial cells 3agenes 3ahumans 3aimmune response 3ainnate immunity 3amessenger RNA 3amicroRNA 3anon-coding RNA 3apneumonia 3aprotein synthesis 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 3atranslation (genetics) 0aInfluenza A virus 0amiR-29c 0aA20 0aInnate immune response1 aDong, Chunyan1 aSun, Xiaoning1 aLi, Zhongyi1 aJing, Qinghe,1 aGuan, Zhenhong1 aDuan, Ming0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2014 July 18, v. 450 p.755-761dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2014.06.0593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03237naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002000143245012100163300001800284520131600302592002801618650002601646650001501672650001601687650001501703650001301718650002401731650001301755650001101768650002101779650002001800650001001820650001001830650001601840650002001856650002601876650000901902650001201911650002101923650001301944650001501957650002001972650002501992650001702017653001702034653001202051653002002063653001702083700001902100700001802119700002102137700001602158700001902174700001802193700001802211700001902229700001902248700001602267700001902283700001702302700001902319773011302338856007902451852000902530655001202539IND60515062020221120193902.0160312e20151201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051506202DNAL7 a10.1089/jmf.2014.34012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJeong, Ji-Woong10aApple Pomace Extract Improves Endurance in Exercise Performance by Increasing Strength and Weight of Skeletal Muscle  ap. 1380-1386.  aUrsolic acid is a lipophilic pentacyclic triterpenoid found in many fruits and herbs and is used in several herbal folk medicines for diabetes. In this study, we evaluated the effects of apple pomace extract (APE; ursolic acid content, 183 mg/g) on skeletal muscle atrophy. To examine APE therapeutic potential in muscle atrophy, we investigated APE effects on the expression of biomarkers associated with muscle atrophy and hypertrophy. We found that APE inhibited atrophy, while inducing hypertrophy in C2C12 myotubes by decreasing the expression of atrophy-related genes and increasing the expression of hypertrophy-associated genes. The in vivo experiments using mice fed a diet with or without APE showed that APE intake increased skeletal muscle mass, as well as grip strength and exercise capacity. In addition, APE significantly improved endurance in the mice, as evidenced by increased exhaustive running time and muscle weight, and reduced the expression of the genes involved in the development of muscle atrophy. APE also decreased the concentration of serum lactate and lactate dehydrogenase, inorganic phosphate, and creatinine, the indicators of accumulated fatigue and exercise-induced stress. These results suggest that APE may be useful as an ergogenic functional food or dietary supplement.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapple pomace extracts 3abiomarkers 3ablood serum 3acreatinine 3adiabetes 3adietary supplements 3aexercise 3afruits 3afunctional foods 3agene expression 3agenes 3aherbs 3ahypertrophy 3ain vivo studies 3alactate dehydrogenase 3amice 3amuscles 3amuscular atrophy 3amyotubes 3aphosphates 3askeletal muscle 3atraditional medicine 3aursolic acid 0aapple pomace 0aatrophy 0amuscle strength 0aursolic acid1 aShim, Jae-Jung1 aChoi, Il-Dong1 aKim, Sŭng-hwan,1 aRa, Jehyeon1 aKu, Hyung Keun1 aLee, Dong Eun1 aKim, Tae-Youl1 aJeung, Woonhee1 aLee, Jung Hee,1 aLee, Ki Won1 aHuh, Chul-Sung1 aSim, Jae-Hun1 aAhn, Young-Tae0 tJournal of medicinal food.g2015 Dec. 01, v. 18, no. 12 p.1380-1386dMary Ann Liebert, Inc.x1557-76007nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1089%2Fjmf.2014.34013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02853naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003100151245015600182300001600338520121800354592002801572650003401600650002201634650001801656650002501674650001701699650001301716650001701729650002001746650001901766650001501785650001101800650001501811650001601826650001501842653002501857653001401882653002301896653002401919653001801943653001501961700006501976700001902041700006302060700002002123773010902143856008602252852000902338655001202347IND60628454420221121065752.0190410e20190405xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062845442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2018.12.0402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRahmanzadeh Ishkeh, Shirin10aLemon verbena (Lippia citrodora) essential oil effects on antioxidant capacity and phytochemical content of raspberry (Rubus ulmifolius subsp. sanctus)  ap. 297-304.  aThe aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of Lemon verbena essential oil on antioxidant and enzyme activity and phytochemical contents of raspberry. Lemon verbena essential oil at concentrations of 0, 250, 500, and 750 μl l−1 were used as a fruit edible coating with antioxidant and fungicide properties. The results showed that, in most parameters, there were statistically significant differences between the treatments and control fruits. The findings revealed that the antioxidant activity measured by DPPH method was increased in most treatments during storage and the maximum amount was found in the treated fruits with 500 μl l−1 EO after nine days (85.63%). Also, flavonoid compounds showed some changes similar to antioxidant activity and the maximum amount was 3.97 mg Qu ml-1 extract. The PAL enzyme activity in most of the essential oil concentrations had an upward trend and its activity level changed from 51.17 to 130.78 μmol trans-cinnamic acid min−1. Our results indicated that the use of essential oil coating was effective in enhancing phytochemical contents and to providing a longer storage life with acceptable external and internal qualities in raspberry fruit.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aAloysia citrodora 3aRubus inermis 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3acoatings 3aedible films 3aenzyme activity 3aessential oils 3aflavonoids 3afruits 3afungicides 3araspberries 3ashelf life 0aAntioxidant activity 0aRaspberry 0aPhenolic compounds 0aPAL enzyme activity 0aEssential oil 0aShelf life1 aAsghari, Mohammadreza1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5363-38621 aShirzad, Habib1 aAlirezalu, Abolfazl1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5882-89811 aGhasemi, Ghader0 tScientia horticulturae.g2019 Apr. 05, v. 248 p.297-304dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4108x0304-42387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2018.12.0403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03349naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245011100173300001400284520168200298592002801980650001402008650001702022650002402039650001002063650001202073650001602085650002002101650001002121650004302131650001502174650002202189650002102211650001502232650001802247650001902265650001302284650001802297653000902315653000802324653000702332653000802339653000902347653000802356653002202364653001702386653001502403653001102418653002402429653001202453700001502465700006002480700001802540773009502558856008502653852000902738655001202747IND60554410920221121133950.0161024e20140101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055441092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jchromb.2013.11.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNelson, Thomas J.10aAdduct formation in liquid chromatography-triple quadrupole mass spectrometric measurement of bryostatin 1  ap. 55-62.  aBryostatin 1, a potential anti-Alzheimer drug, is effective at subnanomolar concentrations. Measurement is complicated by the formation of low m/z degradation products and the formation of adducts with various cations, which make accurate quantitation difficult. Adduct formation caused the sample matrix or mobile phase to partition bryostatin 1 into products of different mass. Degradation of the 927 [M+Na]+ ion to a 869m/z product was strongly influenced by ionization conditions. We validated a bryostatin 1 assay in biological tissues using capillary column HPLC with nanospray ionization (NSI) in a triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer in selected reaction monitoring (SRM) mode. Adduct formation was controlled by adding 1mM acetic acid and 0.1mM sodium acetate to the HPLC buffer, maximizing the formation of the [M+Na]+ ion. Efficient removal of contaminating cholesterol from the sample during solvent extraction was also critical. The increased sensitivity provided by NSI and capillary-bore columns and the elimination of signal partitioning due to adduct formation and degradation in the ionization source enabled a detection limit of 1×10−18mol of bryostatin 1 and a LLOQ of 3×10−18mol from 1μl of sample. Bryostatin 1 at low pmol/l concentrations enabled measurement in brain and other tissues without the use of radioactive labels. Despite bryostatin 1's high molecular weight, considerable brain access was observed, with peak brain concentrations exceeding 8% of the peak blood plasma concentrations. Bryostatin 1 readily crosses the blood–brain barrier, reaching peak concentrations of 0.2nM, and specifically activates and translocates brain PKCɛ.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioassays 3ablood plasma 3ablood-brain barrier 3abrain 3acations 3acholesterol 3adetection limit 3adrugs 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aionization 3amass spectrometry 3amolecular weight 3amonitoring 3anitroprusside 3asodium acetate 3asolvents 3aspectrometers 0aLLOQ 0aPKC 0aAD 0aAβ 0aMTBE 0aNSI 0aMass spectrometry 0aBryostatin 1 0aPaclitaxel 0aAdduct 0aAlzheimer's disease 0aLC–MS1 aSen, Abhik1 aAlkon, Daniel L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8039-53291 aSun, Miao-Kun0 tJournal of Chromatography B.g2014 Jan. 01, v. 944 p.55-62dElsevier B.V.x1570-02327nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jchromb.2013.11.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03747naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005900152245015600211500002200367520199100389592002802380650002002408650001702428650002002445650001702465650001702482650001602499650002702515650001702542650002502559650001102584650000902595650001302604650002402617650001202641650001102653650002902664650001802693650001702711650001902728650001102747650000902758650001502767650001802782653001102800653002102811653001102832653003002843653002002873653003002893653002002923700001802943773010002961856008703061852000903148655001203157IND60633648420221122071224.0190321e20190317xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063364842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2019.03.0512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSezer, Nurettin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6459-402610aDevelopment and performance assessment of a new integrated solar, wind, and osmotic power system for multigeneration, based on thermodynamic principles  aPre-press version  aThis study analyzes a new renewable energy-based multigeneration system, in which the energy sources are efficiently utilized to generate several useful commodities such as hydrogen, oxygen, desalted water, and refrigeration along with electricity. Osmotic power from desalination brine solution is harvested to contribute to the electricity generation and to reduce the environmental impact of brine. The system units are concentrated photovoltaics/thermal (CPVT), wind turbines, thermal energy storage (TES), hydrogen electrolyzer, hydrogen fuel cell, multistage flash (MSF) distillation, vapor compression refrigeration (VCR) cycle, and pressure retarded osmosis (PRO). The energetic and exergetic performance of the overall system, as well as the system units, are calculated based on the first and second law of thermodynamics. Further, a comprehensive parametric study is conducted to investigate the effect of varying environmental and operational conditions, and the input parameters on the production rate, exergy destruction rate and efficiencies. For maintaining the high efficiency of CPV operation, the heat generated on photovoltaic (PV) cells is dissipated by an effective cooling system. This heat is then stored in the TES to be further utilized in desalination. The TES is used for eliminating energy fluctuations in the system and for a continuous operation by storing the energy for the time, when energy from the sun is not available. The electricity from CPV and wind power is used in the VCR cycle and hydrogen electrolysis. The fuel cell can be operated during the time of peak electricity demand. After performing thermodynamic analysis over the system, the overall energy and exergy efficiencies are determined as 73.3% and 30.6%, respectively. The exergy destruction rates of the components are specified. In brief, generation of multiple commodities is assured based on a clean operation by a novel integration of multiple clean energy sources in one system.  aPublisher supplied data 3abrine solutions 3aclean energy 3acooling systems 3adesalination 3adistillation 3aelectricity 3aelectricity generation 3aelectrolysis 3aenvironmental impact 3aexergy 3aheat 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen fuel cells 3aosmosis 3aoxygen 3aproducts and commodities 3arefrigeration 3asolar energy 3athermal energy 3avapors 3awind 3awind power 3awind turbines 0aEnergy 0arenewable energy 0aexergy 0aconcentrated solar energy 0amultigeneration 0apressure retarded osmosis 0ahydrogen energy1 aKoç, Muammer0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2019 Mar. 17, dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2019.03.0513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02804naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245010300169520159700272592002801869650001401897650002501911650001701936650002201953650001601975650001401991650001602005650001502021650001402036650000902050650001202059650002102071700001802092700002702110700001902137700002402156773013302180856008402313852000902397655001202406IND60790785820221119144041.0220826e20220818xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079078582DNAL7 a10.3390/agriculture120812502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmgain, Naba R.10aFrom Ground to Grain: Tracing Phosphorus and Potassium in Flooded Rice Cultivar Grown on Histosols  aTo trace the phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) content in flooded rice (Oryza sativa L), 14 rice cultivars commonly grown in the Southern United States were evaluated for their P and K concentration in tissue and grain. Field experiments were conducted at two locations in Everglades Agriculture Area (EAA), where flooded rice was cultivated on organic Histosols. Soil pH and Mehlich-3 phosphorus (M3P) were significantly different between locations. At Site I, soil pH, M3P, and Mehlich-3 potassium (M3K) varied in the range of 6.8–7.1, 21.4–36.4 mg kg⁻¹, and 53.9–151.0 mg kg⁻¹, respectively. At Site II, soil pH, M3P and M3K varied in the range of 6.9–7.3, 11.2–20.5 mg kg⁻¹, and 64.8–104.1 mg kg⁻¹, respectively. Stem potassium was the only measured parameter that was significantly different among rice cultivars at both sites. At Site I and Site II, stem K ranged from 14.2–26.6 mg kg⁻¹ and 10.4–19.4 mg kg⁻¹, respectively. No significant difference in yield among cultivars was observed at Site I, whereas Site II had a significant difference in yield among cultivars. At Site I and Site II, yields ranged from 3745–7587 kg ha⁻¹ and 2627–6406 kg ha⁻¹, respectively. None of the cultivars ranked consistently in the same top and bottom position for each measured parameter. Total phosphorus (TP) concentration was highest in grain, whereas total potassium (TK) concentration was highest in the stem. Results suggest incorporation of rice stem into the soil could potentially add fertilizer back to the soil which helps in fertility management.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHistosols 3aMehlich-3 phosphorus 3aOryza sativa 3aagricultural land 3aagriculture 3acultivars 3afertilizers 3aphosphorus 3apotassium 3arice 3asoil pH 3atotal phosphorus1 aFan, Yuchuan 1 aVanWeelden, Matthew T.1 aRabbany, Abul 1 aBhadha, Jehangir H.0 tAgriculture (Basel).g2022 Aug. 18, v. 12, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12387x2077-04727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agriculture120812503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02750naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100006100152245012000213300001600333520107400349592002801423650002801451650002201479650001401501650001401515650003201529650001701561650002401578650001501602650002001617650001301637650001101650650000901661650002201670650001501692650001601707650002501723653002301748653002401771653003001795653001501825653002001840653002601860700002301886700001701909700005501926700002801981773011502009856008702124852000902211655001202220IND60633648520221122063211.0190509e20190515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063364852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2019.03.0522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMalani, Ritesh S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7029-727410aUltrasound–assisted enzymatic biodiesel production using blended feedstock of non–edible oils: Kinetic analysis  ap. 142-150.  aThe present study reports ultrasound–assisted biodiesel synthesis using blended feedstock of non–edible oils and commercial immobilized lipase from Thermomyces lanuginosus. Optimum process parameters obtained using Box–Behnken statistical design were as follows: alcohol/oil molar ratio = 7.64:1, enzyme loading = 3.55% (w/w) and temperature = 36 °C, conversion = 90%. Sonication of reaction mixture resulted in lowering of activation energy to 100.4 kJ/mol (from 124.4 kJ/mol under mechanical agitation). Addition of water to reaction mixture (10% v/v) not only boosted biodiesel yield from 90% to 94% but also lowered activation energy to 78.7 kJ/mol. Analysis of reaction kinetics using ordered Bi–Bi model revealed drastic rise (∼1.6×) in reaction velocity with concurrent changes in Michaelis–Menten and dissociation constant of both substrate and products. Finally, the recycled enzyme showed good retention of activity up to 6 cycles in presence of ultrasound, which further enhanced with water addition to reaction mixture.  aPublisher supplied data 3aThermomyces lanuginosus 3aactivation energy 3aagitation 3abiodiesel 3acarboxylic ester hydrolases 3adissociation 3aexperimental design 3afeedstocks 3afuel production 3akinetics 3amodels 3aoils 3areaction kinetics 3asonication 3atemperature 3aultrasonic treatment 0aImmobilized lipase 0aTransesterification 0aBlended non–edible oils 0aUltrasound 0aEnzyme kinetics 0aOrdered Bi–Bi model1 aUmriwad, Sachin B.1 aKumar, Karan1 aGoyal, Arun1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3403-95471 aMoholkar, Vijayanand S.0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2019 May 15, v. 188 p.142-150dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2019.03.0523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03203naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002700143245006300170300001600233520117900249592002801428650002101456650002501477650002501502650001601527650002701543650001801570650002101588650002001609650002501629650001601654650001301670650001701683650001501700650002001715650004101735650001901776650001201795650001101807650001101818650001001829650002201839650001201861650000901873650001001882650002101892650001601913653001301929653001201942653001101954653001101965653002101976653001601997700004102013700002802054700002702082700002902109700003002138700004002168700003602208700003202244700001902276773011002295856007902405852000902484655001202493IND60515062220221121143656.0160312e20150301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051506222DNAL7 a10.1089/jmf.2013.01702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarbalho, Sandra Maria10aAntidiabetic and Antilipidemic Effects of Manilkara zapota  ap. 385-391.  aManilkara zapota is a tropical evergreen tree belonging to the Sapotaceae family; its parts are used in alternative medicine to treat coughs and colds and possess diuretic, antidiarrheal, antibiotic, antihyperglycemic, and hypocholesterolemic effects. There are no studies on metabolic profile after using the fruit, and this study aimed at evaluating the effects of the leaf and pulp of M. zapota fruit on the metabolic profile of Wistar rats. Male rats were treated for 50 days with M. zapota leaf juice or fruit juice, after which their biochemical and body composition profiles were analyzed (glycemia, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c), insulin, leptin, aspartate transaminase, alanine aminotransferase, Lee Index, and body mass index). Our results indicate significantly lower levels of glycemia, insulin, leptin, cholesterol, and triglycerides and augmented levels of HDL-c in animals treated with the leaves or fruit of this plant. The percentage of weight gain also declined in animals treated with M. zapota fruit pulp. The use of the M. zapota may be helpful in the prevention of obesity, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and their complications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aManilkara zapota 3aalanine transaminase 3aalternative medicine 3aantibiotics 3aaspartate transaminase 3ablood glucose 3abody composition 3abody mass index 3acholesteremic effect 3acommon cold 3adiabetes 3afruit juices 3afruit pulp 3aglycemic effect 3ahigh density lipoprotein cholesterol 3ahyperlipidemia 3ainsulin 3aleaves 3aleptin 3amales 3ametabolic studies 3aobesity 3arats 3atrees 3atriacylglycerols 3aweight gain 0aglycemia 0ainsulin 0aleptin 0alipids 0aManilkara zapota 0aWistar rats1 aBueno, Patrícia Cincotto dos Santos1 aDelazari, Débora Souza1 aGuiguer, Elen Landgraf1 aCoqueiro, Daniel Pereira1 aAraújo, Adriano Cressoni1 ade Souza, Maricelma da Silva Soares1 aFarinazzi-Machado, Flávia M.V.1 aMendes, Claudemir Gregório1 aGroppo, Milton0 tJournal of medicinal food.g2015 Mar. 01, v. 18, no. 3 p.385-391dMary Ann Liebert, Inc.x1557-76007nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1089%2Fjmf.2013.01703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02894naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245011500170520162600285592002801911650001801939650001201957650001601969650001401985650001001999650001502009650002602024650003302050653001102083653001902094653002602113653001602139653002002155700001602175700002102191700001302212700001802225700005902243773010902302856005202411852000902463655001202472IND60795488920221122002810.0221004e20230127xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079548892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2022.1115582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTan, Shan-Shan10aGenome-wide identification reveals the DcMADS-box family transcription factors involved in flowering of carrot  aMADS-box is the important transcription factor involved in the process of nutritional and reproductive growth of plants. To explore the information of MADS-box transcription factors in carrots (Daucus carota L.), we conducted a genome-wide identification and characteristic analysis of MADS-box in carrot. A total of 104 MADS-box factors were identified, and 48 Type Ⅰ MADS-box factors were classified into three subfamilies, Mα, Mβ, and Mγ. Among the 56 type Ⅱ MADS-box factors, 51 MADS-box factors belonged to MIKCC and 5 factors belonged to MIKC*. Subcellular localization prediction indicated that most DcMADS-box proteins were localized in the nuclear. A total of 90 DcMADS-box genes were distributed on all 9 chromosomes, and 19 tandem duplication gene pairs and 20 segmental duplication gene pairs were identified. The DcMADS-box promoter contained a variety of cis-acting regulatory elements, such as light responsiveness elements, low-temperature responsiveness elements, and hormone responsiveness elements. The results of protein interaction prediction and yeast two-hybrid assay indicated that DcMDAS-box proteins related to flowering, such as DcMADS004 and DcMADS079 can interact with DcMADS012. In addition, we found that the expression profiles of floral organ-related genes showed varietal differences and stage specificity in the three stages (early flower bud stage, middle flower bud stage, and full bloom stage) of ‘Kurodagosun’ (KRD) and ‘Deep purple’ (DPP). These results provide a potential theoretical basis for exploring the molecular mechanisms of carrot flower organ development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDaucus carota 3acarrots 3aflower buds 3aflowering 3agenes 3aprediction 3atranscription factors 3atwo hybrid system techniques 0aCarrot 0aMADS-box genes 0aEvolutionary analysis 0aInteraction 0aGene expression1 aDuan, Ao-Qi1 aWang, Guang-Long1 aLiu, Hui1 aXu, Zhi-Sheng1 aXiong, Ai-Sheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7900-50010 tScientia horticulturae.g2023 Jan. 27, v. 308 p.111558-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4108x0304-42387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2022.111558  aDNAL 7aarticle03362naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001900155245018500174520181300359592002802172650002002200650002002220650001102240650001702251650003102268650001702299650001102316650001502327650001502342650002202357650002802379650001602407650001202423650003102435650001102466651001002477653000802487653000902495653002302504653002002527653002702547700001502574700002102589700001602610700001502626700001302641773009102654856009002745852000902835655001202844IND60685131920221120120842.0200503e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068513192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.1263242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Zi-Feng10aIndoor occurrence and health risk of formaldehyde, toluene, xylene and total volatile organic compounds derived from an extensive monitoring campaign in Harbin, a megacity of China  aHuman exposure to formaldehyde, toluene, xylene (FTX) and other volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are associated with negative health impact. To characterize the exposure and health effects of FTX and TVOC from indoor environments, we conducted an extensive monitoring campaign involving 1278 measurements of 472 indoor locations in Harbin, a megacity in China from May 2013 to March 2018. The results showed that household had the highest mean formaldehyde concentration (0.171 ± 0.084 mg m-3) among all types of indoor environments. Meanwhile, there was no significant differences in formaldehyde concentration of the living room, master bedroom, secondary bedroom and study room (p > 0.05), as well as toluene and xylene. The highest mean concentration of toluene, xylene and TVOC was measured in public bath center. Great difference was found between formaldehyde concentrations in 2013 and other years, except 2015. There were great positive nonlinear correlations between the indoor temperature and concentration of formaldehyde (p < 0.01), good negative nonlinear correlations between the finish time of decoration and concentration of formaldehyde (p < 0.01), good positive linear correlations between the relative humidity and concentration of formaldehyde (p < 0.01). A risk assessment methodology was utilized to evaluate the potential adverse health effects of the individual FTX compounds according to their carcinogenicities. The predicted carcinogenic risk of formaldehyde was greater than the threshold value 1E-06 at all environments. The non-carcinogenic risk of TX compounds in the population is negligible. For estimating human health risk exposure, sensitivity analysis showed that more attention should be given to the influential variables such as the level of pollutants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3acarcinogenicity 3acities 3aformaldehyde 3ahealth effects assessments 3ahuman health 3ahumans 3amonitoring 3apollutants 3arelative humidity 3arisk assessment process 3atemperature 3atoluene 3avolatile organic compounds 3axylene 3aChina 0aFTX 0aTVOC 0aIndoor air quality 0aFactor analysis 0aHealth risk assessment1 aZhang, Xue1 aZhang, Xian-ming1 aLiu, Li-Yan1 aLi, Yi-Fan1 aSun, Wei0 tChemosphere.g2020 July, v. 250 p.126324-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.1263243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02921naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245008500171520160800256592002801864650001601892650002601908650002501934650001301959650001201972650001601984650001402000650002002014650001002034650001502044650001402059650001502073650001202088700001802100700002102118700002202139700001502161700002502176700001902201700002902220773013302249856008402382852000902466655001202475IND60790785920221119144412.0220826e20220818xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079078592DNAL7 a10.3390/agriculture120812512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aButucel, Eugenia 10aFarm Biosecurity Measures and Interventions with an Impact on Bacterial Biofilms  aFarm biosecurity management includes a set of practical measures used to prevent and limit the spread of infections to humans and animals. Infections, predominantly caused by zoonotic agents, often occur due to a lack of safety standards monitoring on farms, but also because of the use of inappropriate antimicrobial products leading to bacterial resistance, tolerance to biocides and the emergence antimicrobial-resistant germs. To date, research was mainly focused on studying the antimicrobial resistance in bacterial biofilms and the mechanisms involved in their occurrence. At molecular level, the limited diffusion of biocides in the biofilm matrix, enzyme-mediated resistance, genetic adaptation, efflux pumps, and levels of metabolic activity inside the biofilm are some of the investigated biological mechanisms which can promote antimicrobial resistance in biofilms were also investigated. Interventions, based on the identification of novel antimicrobial compounds, that would exclude the occurrence of bacterial tolerance, including essential oils (oregano, cloves), organic acids (tannic & oleic acid) and natural plant compounds (e.g. alkaloids, flavonoids, tannins and coumarins) were also extensively studied and reviewed given their effectiveness against pathogen-produced biofilms. The aim of this review was emphasize the importance of biosecurity and farm management practices and to assess their impact on bacterial biofilm formation. Furthermore, we present the recent intervention strategies aimed at reducing and combating the formation of bacterial biofilms in livestock farms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagriculture 3aantibiotic resistance 3abiochemical pathways 3abiocides 3abiofilm 3abiosecurity 3acoumarins 3afarm management 3afarms 3aflavonoids 3alivestock 3aoleic acid 3aoregano1 aBalta, Igori 1 aMcCleery, David 1 aMorariu, Florica 1 aPet, Ioan 1 aPopescu, Cosmin Alin1 aStef, Lavinia 1 aCorcionivoschi, Nicolae 0 tAgriculture (Basel).g2022 Aug. 18, v. 12, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12387x2077-04727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agriculture120812513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02924naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245011400167300001400281520171400295592002802009650001102037650001202048650002302060650002302083650001802106650001102124650001202135650002702147653001002174653000802184653002702192653002102219700001402240700001502254700001302269700001302282700001402295773009902309856008502408852000902493655001202502IND60554411020221121133938.0161024e20140115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055441102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jchromb.2013.11.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNi, Meiping10aRelationship study of partition coefficients between ionic liquid and headspace for organic solvents by HS-GC  ap. 60-67.  aA general study was carried out to investigate the relationship between analytes (organic solvents) and matrix medium (ionic liquids, ILs) by headspace gas chromatography (HS-GC) in order to provide a guidance to choose a suitable matrix medium during the process of experiment. Thirteen ILs contained different cations or anions and two kinds of organic solvents (alkylogens and aprotic solvents which involved ability of pro-proton) performed different interactions with ILs were chosen in this study. The concentrations of analytes in headspace were determined by HS-GC and then logK (the logarithm of concentration radio between matrix medium and headspace) was calculated respectively. Factors which affect logK, such as logPO/W (the logarithm of the octanol/water partition coefficient for a solvent) for different cations (including parent nucleus and alkyl chains) and anions of ILs, were investigated. The results indicated that the longer alkyl chains, the lower polarity of parent nucleus and the higher polarity of anions performed the higher headspace efficiency for alkylogens. Meanwhile, the shorter alkyl chains and the lower polarity of parent nucleus make the higher headspace efficiency for aprotic solvents which involved ability of pro-proton. For both kinds of organic solvents, anions of ILs performed little influences to headspace efficiency. The relationship between ILs and organic solvents was primarily investigated and a helpful guidance was provided for the application of ILs as matrix medium to analyze solvents by HS-GC. The model was successfully used to determine the organic residual solvents in ketoconanzale to choose a suitable ionic liquid during the process of HS-GC.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanions 3acations 3agas chromatography 3aheadspace analysis 3aionic liquids 3amodels 3aoctanol 3apartition coefficients 0aHS-GC 0aILs 0aPartition coefficients 0aOrganic solvents1 aSun, Ting1 aZhang, Lin1 aLiu, Yan1 aXu, Meng1 aJiang, Ye0 tJournal of Chromatography B.g2014 Jan. 15, v. 945-946 p.60-67dElsevier B.V.x1570-02327nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jchromb.2013.11.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03145naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094024002200134024001900156040001800175100002000193245009000213300001400303506007600317520171600393592002802109506003702137650002502174650001402199650002102213650001502234650001002249650001402259650001302273650000902286650001302295650001602308653001102324653001402335653000902349653002502358653002602383653002402409700005902433773008702492856008702579852000902666655001202675IND60633648620221207091808.0190509e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063364862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.peptides.2019.01.0032doi7 aPMC68630792pmcid7 a308903552pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEidson, Lori N.10aInflammatory mediators of opioid tolerance: Implications for dependency and addiction  ap. 51-58.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aEach year, over 50 million Americans suffer from persistent pain, including debilitating headaches, joint pain, and severe back pain. Although morphine is amongst the most effective analgesics available for the management of severe pain, prolonged morphine treatment results in decreased analgesic efficacy (i.e., tolerance). Despite significant headway in the field, the mechanisms underlying the development of morphine tolerance are not well understood. The midbrain ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (vlPAG) is a primary neural substrate for the analgesic effects of morphine, as well as for the development of morphine tolerance. A growing body of literature indicates that activated glia (i.e., microglia and astrocytes) facilitate pain transmission and oppose morphine analgesia, making these cells important potential targets in the treatment of chronic pain. Morphine affects glia by binding to the innate immune receptor toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), leading to the release of proinflammatory cytokines and opposition of morphine analgesia. Despite the established role of the vlPAG as an integral locus for the development of morphine tolerance, most studies have examined the role of glia activation within the spinal cord. Additionally, the role of TLR4 in the development of tolerance has not been elucidated. This review attempts to summarize what is known regarding the role of vlPAG glia and TLR4 in the development of morphine tolerance. These data, together, provide information about the mechanism by which central nervous system glia regulate morphine tolerance, and identify a potential therapeutic target for the enhancement of analgesic efficacy in the clinical treatment of chronic pain.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aToll-like receptor 4 3aanalgesia 3aanalgesic effect 3aastrocytes 3abrain 3acytokines 3aheadache 3aloci 3amorphine 3aspinal cord 0aOpioid 0aTolerance 0aGlia 0aToll-like receptor 4 0aTumor necrosis factor 0aPeriaqueductal gray1 aMurphy, Anne Z.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2889-503X0 tPeptides.g2019 May, v. 115 p.51-58dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11832x0196-97817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.peptides.2019.01.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02840naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002000144245009300164300002000257520142500277592002801702650001501730650002101745650001301766650001301779650001101792650001401803650001401817650002101831650001201852650001901864650001801883650001401901650001601915650000901931650001101940650001301951653001801964653001101982653002501993653002402018653001202042700001202054700001802066700001902084773014202103856008002245852000902325655001202334IND60579972920221118005947.0170907e20170906xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057997292DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.7b077002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMitra, Debirupa10aTransparent Copper-Loaded Chitosan/Silica Antibacterial Coatings with Long-Term Efficacy  ap. 29515-29525.  aBacteria-contaminated inanimate surfaces within hospitals and clinics result in transmission of pathogens via direct or indirect contact, leading to increased risk of healthcare-associated infections (HAI). The use of antibacterial coatings is a potential way of reducing the bacterial burden, but many surfaces such as instrument panels and monitors necessitate the coatings to be transparent while being highly antibacterial. In this work, silica nanoparticles (SiO₂ NPs) were first grown over a layer of acrylated quaternized chitosan (AQCS) covalently immobilized on commercially available transparent poly(vinyl fluoride) (PVF) films. The SiO₂ NPs then served as nanoreservoirs for adsorption of copper ions. The coated PVF films were transparent and reduced viable bacterial count by ∼99% and 100%, when incubated with a bacteria-loaded droplet for 60 and 120 min, respectively. The killing efficacy of these coatings, after wiping 100 times, with a deionized water-wetted cloth was reduced slightly to 97–98%. The stability of these coatings can be further improved with the deposition of another layer of cationic quaternized chitosan (QCS) over the negatively charged SiO₂ NP layer, wherein the coatings maintained ∼99% killing efficacy even after 100 wipes. These coatings showed no significant toxicity to mammalian cells and, hence, can potentially be used in a clinical setting for reducing HAI.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3achemical bonding 3achitosan 3acoatings 3acopper 3afluorides 3ahospitals 3aindirect contact 3amammals 3amicrobial load 3ananoparticles 3apathogens 3aplate count 3arisk 3asilica 3atoxicity 0aantibacterial 0acopper 0aquaternized chitosan 0asilica nanoparticle 0acoating1 aLi, Min1 aKang, En-Tang1 aNeoh, Koon Gee0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2017 Sept. 06, v. 9, no. 35 p.29515-29525dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.7b077003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02729naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245009800167506010400265506007600369520127000445592002801715506003701743650002101780650002001801650002001821650001701841650002801858650003001886650001601916650002201932650001501954653001301969653002701982653001502009653001702024653001602041700002002057700002102077773010602098856008202204852000902286655001202295IND60767747420221207080602.0220507e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076774742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.psj.2022.1017862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDittoe, Dana K.10aImpact of the gastrointestinal microbiome and fermentation metabolites on broiler performance  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aOptimal broiler performance is dependent on several factors such as bird genetics, environment management, and nutrition. The gastrointestinal tract microbial ecology and metabolic activities have long been considered factors contributing to broiler performance responses. However, until recently, it was difficult to define the impact of the gastrointestinal microorganisms on the broiler host. With advances in microbiome sequencing technology, there has been a rapid increase in data generated using both experimental and commercial broiler operations. As the gastrointestinal microbiome data becomes more in-depth, opportunities to link microbiota composition to broiler performance metrics such as broiler growth rate and feed conversion efficiency have emerged. In parallel, with the increased understanding of the microbiota, there has been a shift to modulate the microbiome in order to alter metabolic patterns such as fermentation products. In this review, fermentation pathways and metabolites and the relationship with the microbiome will be discussed. Additionally, this review will connect these patterns and interpretations with current broiler performance data and the potential future directions these relationships could take the broiler industry.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3achicken industry 3adigestive tract 3afeed conversion 3afermentation 3agastrointestinal system 3aintestinal microorganisms 3ametabolites 3amicrobial ecology 3amicrobiome 0abroilers 0agastrointestinal tract 0amicrobiome 0afermentation 0ametabolites1 aOlson, Elena G.1 aRicke, Steven C.0 tPoultry science.g2022 May, v. 101, no. 5 p.101786-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45501x0032-57917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.psj.2022.1017863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02849naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245011300167300001600280520142400296592002801720650002201748650001501770650001301785650001001798650001601808650002301824650002401847650001301871650001901884650001101903653001201914653002101926653002001947653001901967653007001986653001802056700001802074700001502092700001402107700001902121700001802140700002002158773009602178856008402274852000902358655001202367IND60122350120221120125657.0150325e20150217xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012235012DNAL7 a10.1080/07373937.2014.9546672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDai, Jian-Wu10aProcess-Based Drying Temperature and Humidity Integration Control Enhances Drying Kinetics of Apricot Halves  ap. 365-376.  aThe effects of drying temperature (50, 60, and 70°C) and absolute humidity (65, 90, 115, 140 g/kg at the initial stage) on drying kinetics and color attributes of apricot halves under process-based drying temperature and humidity integration control (PDTHIC) were investigated. Results indicated that appropriate PDTHIC could reduce the drying time by 18.75% compared to the control group. The absolute humidity parameter should be controlled well rather than continuously dehumidify for traditional practices. The moisture effective diffusivity (D ₑff) at 70°C presented drastic fluctuations with increasing absolute humidity parameters, calculated using the Weibull distribution model. The activation energy (E ₐ) of samples treated by continuous dehumidification and PDTHIC were 31.40 and 74.18 kJ/mol, respectively. The variation trend of color parameters was different from the conventional hot air drying probably due to the dehydration mechanism. Observation of the microstructure of the dried samples indicated that the PDTHIC process can enhance the drying rate of apricot through generating a larger pore network compared to continuous dehumidification at the same temperature. The findings of the current work clearly indicated that process-based drying temperature and humidity integration control enhances the drying kinetics of apricot halves, leading to a promising technology for energy savings.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivation energy 3aair drying 3aapricots 3acolor 3adiffusivity 3adrying temperature 3aenergy conservation 3ahumidity 3amicrostructure 3amodels 0aApricot 0aColor parameters 0aDrying kinetics 0aMicrostructure 0aProcess-based drying temperature and humidity integration control 0aWeibull model1 aRao, Jun-Quan1 aWang, Dong1 aXie, Long1 aXiao, Hong-Wei1 aLiu, Yan-Hong1 aGao, Zhen-Jiang0 tDrying technology.g2015 Feb. 17, v. 33, no. 3 p.365-376dTaylor & Francisx1532-23007nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07373937.2014.9546673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02370naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001900155245007700174300001600251520101300267592002801280650002401308650002401332650001201356650002701368650002301395650002301418650001401441650001001455650001101465650001401476653002401490653001101514653001001525653003901535653001501574700002001589700002501609700002101634700001801655700002001673700001701693773009101710856009001801852000901891655001201900IND60563761220221120025308.0181011e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056376122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2017.02.1082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChacana, Jaime10aEffect of ozonation on anaerobic digestion sludge activity and viability  ap. 405-411.  aThe effect of ozonation of anaerobic digested sludge on methane production was studied as a means of increasing the capacity of municipal anaerobic digesters. Ozone doses ranging from 0 to 192 mg O3/g sludge COD were evaluated in batch tests with a bench scale ozonation unit. Ozonation initially, and temporarily, reduced biomass viability and acetoclastic methanogenic activity, resulting in an initial lag phase ranging from 0.8 to 10 days. Following this lag phase, ozonation enhanced methane production with an optimal methane yield attained at 86 mg O3/g COD. Under these conditions, the yield of methane and the rate of its formation were 52% and 95% higher, respectively, than those factors measured without ozonation. A required optimal ozone dose could be feasible to improve the anaerobic digestion performance by increasing the methane production potential with a minimum impact on microbial activity; thus, an optimal ozone dose would enable an increase in the capacity of anaerobic digesters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanaerobic digesters 3aanaerobic digestion 3abiomass 3achemical oxygen demand 3amethane production 3amicrobial activity 3aozonation 3aozone 3asludge 3aviability 0aAnaerobic digestion 0aSludge 0aOzone 0aExtracellular polymeric substances 0aMechanisms1 aAlizadeh, Sanaz1 aLabelle, Marc-André1 aLaporte, Antoine1 aHawari, Jalal1 aBarbeau, Benoit1 aComeau, Yves0 tChemosphere.g2017 June, v. 176 p.405-411dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2017.02.1083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02535naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245020900153300002000362520108800382592002801470650001701498650001401515650002301529650003001552650002601582650001201608650001401620650006601634650001401700650001101714650001501725650001401740650002001754700001801774700001801792700001901810700001501829700002001844700001701864773012401881856007502005852000902080655001202089IND60667198820221120205300.0220405e20150331xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066719882DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra15601c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yang10aDirect aerobic liquid phase epoxidation of propylene catalyzed by Mn(iii) porphyrin under mild conditions: evidence for the existence of both peroxide and Mn(iv)-oxo species from in situ characterizations  ap. 30014-30020.  aGenerally, gaseous propylene is hard to oxidize directly in liquid phase by dioxygen under mild conditions. Here, the liquid phase epoxidation of propylene to propylene oxide (PO) using molecular oxygen catalyzed by manganese porphyrins (MnTPPCl) in the presence of benzaldehyde was developed. Manganese(iii) porphyrin exhibited excellent activity for the selective oxidation of propylene under mild conditions. The conversion of propylene and selectivity towards PO can reach 38% and 80%, respectively. The turnover frequency (TOF) of MnTPPCl catalyst reached 1840 h⁻¹. Experiment evidences that the generation of peroxide and Mn(iv) oxo species during propylene epoxidation occurred, which was confirmed by in situ IR, in situ UV and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS). On the basis of the experimental results, the mechanism for the epoxidation of propylene in the presence of metalloporphyrins and benzaldehyde with dioxygen was proposed. The mechanism is also supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations.  aPublisher supplied data 3abenzaldehyde 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3adensity functional theory 3aepoxidation reactions 3aliquids 3amanganese 3amatrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization mass spectrometry 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3aporphyrins 3apropylene 3apropylene oxide1 aZhou, Xiantai1 aChen, Shaoyun1 aLuo, Rongchang1 aJiang, Jun1 aLiang, Zhongxiu1 aJi, Hongbing0 tRSC advances.g2015 Mar. 31, v. 5, no. 38 p.30014-30020dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ra15601c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03125naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094024002200131024001900153040001800172100002100190245009400211300001600305506007600321520168800397592002802085506003702113650001202150650002102162650001502183650001402198650002402212650001902236650000902255650001802264650001302282650001202295653002102307653001302328653002202341653002602363653001802389700002402407700001902431773011302450856008302563852000902646655001202655IND60599050320221207113459.0180702e20140715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059905032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ydbio.2014.04.0072doi7 aPMC41311992pmcid7 a247693682pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOkolowsky, Nadia10aOestrogen receptor-alpha regulates non-canonical Hedgehog-signalling in the mammary gland  ap. 219-229.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMesenchymal dysplasia (mes) mice harbour a truncation in the C-terminal region of the Hh-ligand receptor, Patched-1 (mPtch1). While the mes variant of mPtch1 binds to Hh-ligands with an affinity similar to that of wild type mPtch1 and appears to normally regulate canonical Hh-signalling via smoothened, the mes mutation causes, among other non-lethal defects, a block to mammary ductal elongation at puberty. We demonstrated previously Hh-signalling induces the activation of Erk1/2 and c-src independently of its control of smo activity. Furthermore, mammary epithelial cell-directed expression of an activated allele of c-src rescued the block to ductal elongation in mes mice, albeit with delayed kinetics. Given that this rescue was accompanied by an induction in estrogen receptor-alpha (ERα) expression and that complex regulatory interactions between ERα and c-src are required for normal mammary gland development, it was hypothesized that expression of ERα would also overcome the block to mammary ductal elongation at puberty in the mes mouse. We demonstrate here that conditional expression of ERα in luminal mammary epithelial cells on the mes background facilitates ductal morphogenesis with kinetics similar to that of the MMTV-c-srcᴬᶜᵗ mice. We demonstrate further that Erk1/2 is activated in primary mammary epithelial cells by Shh-ligand and that this activation is blocked by the inhibitor of c-src, PP2, is partially blocked by the ERα inhibitor, ICI 182780 but is not blocked by the smo-inhibitor, SANT-1. These data reveal an apparent Hh-signalling cascade operating through c-src and ERα that is required for mammary gland morphogenesis at puberty.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aalleles 3aepithelial cells 3aepithelium 3aestrogens 3amammary development 3amammary glands 3amice 3amorphogenesis 3amutation 3apuberty 0aHedgehog pathway 0aPatched1 0aEstrogen receptor 0aMesenchymal dysplasia 0aMammary gland1 aFurth, Priscilla A.1 aHamel, Paul A.0 tDevelopmental biology.g2014 July 15, v. 391, no. 2 p.219-229dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12382x0012-16067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ydbio.2014.04.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03215naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001800144245008300162300001600245520164700261592002801908650001201936650001101948650001901959650001301978650002001991650002402011650001602035650001402051650001502065650001402080650001602094650001602110650000802126650001202134650001502146650002202161650001202183650002402195650001002219651002102229653002302250653002202273653002602295653002102321700001602342700001902358700001802377700001702395700001802412773013202430856007802562852000902640655001202649IND60682844720221118011755.0200203s2020    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068284472DNAL7 a10.1139/apnm-2019-02112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Seong-Ah10aAssociation between dietary flavonoid intake and obesity among adults in Korea  ap. 203-212.  aThis study aimed to investigate the association between dietary flavonoid intake and the prevalence of obesity using body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, and percent body fat (%BF) according to sex among Korean adults. Based on the Korean Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2008–2011, 23 118 adults in Korea were included. Dietary intakes were obtained using 24-h dietary recall data. A higher total intake of flavonoid was associated with a lower prevalence of obesity in women, based on %BF (odds ratio [95% confidence interval] = 0.82 [0.71–0.94]), and abdominal obesity (0.81 [0.71–0.92]). The intake of flavonols (0.88 [0.78–0.99]), flavanones (0.81 [0.72–0.92]), flavanols (0.85 [0.74–0.97]), isoflavones (0.85 [0.75–0.96]), and proanthocyanidins (0.81 [0.71–0.92]) was inversely associated with abdominal obesity, and a higher intake of flavanones (0.87 [0.76–0.99]) and proanthocyanidins (0.85 [0.75–0.98]) was associated with a lower prevalence of obesity, with respect to %BF in women. In contrast, the intake of flavonols (1.16 [1.02–1.33]), flavanones (1.18 [1.04–1.35]), and anthocyanidins (1.27 [1.11–1.46]) was positively associated with obesity based on BMI in men. In conclusion, high intake of dietary flavonoids may be associated with a decreased prevalence of abdominal obesity and obesity, based on %BF, among women. Novelty Higher flavonoid intake was associated with decreased prevalence of abdominal obesity and obesity based on %BF in Korean women. However, in men, the intake of flavonols, flavanones, and anthocyanidins was positively associated with obesity as given by BMI.  aPublisher supplied data 3aKoreans 3aadults 3aanthocyanidins 3abody fat 3abody mass index 3aconfidence interval 3adiet recall 3aflavanols 3aflavanones 3aflavonols 3afood intake 3aisoflavones 3amen 3aobesity 3aodds ratio 3aproanthocyanidins 3asurveys 3awaist circumference 3awomen 3aKorean Peninsula 0adietary flavonoids 0aabdominal obesity 0abody mass index (BMI) 0apercent body fat1 aKim, Jiyoon1 aJun, Shinyoung1 aWie, Gyung-Ah1 aShin, Sangah1 aJoung, Hyojee0 tApplied physiology, nutrition and metabolism.g2020, v. 45, no. 2 p.203-212dNRC Research PresswJournal:23115x1715-53207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/apnm-2019-02113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02624naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245011700166520137300283592002801656650001201684650002301696650002101719650002101740650002001761650002501781650001601806653002101822653001801843653003501861653002501896653001601921653001001937700002401947700002301971700002201994773011702016856008402133852000902217655001202226IND60779827920221120112645.0220816e20220901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077982792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agwat.2022.1077662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBopp, Carlos10aIrrigation water use, shadow values and productivity: Evidence from stochastic production frontiers in vineyards  aIncreasing agricultural water use efficiency has the potential to contribute significantly to hydrological sustainability and to coping with increasing water scarcity. This paper focuses on the role of the quantity of irrigation water applied and irrigation method used in explaining output in wine grape farms. We applied propensity score matching to reduce potential selection bias from observables that might mediate in the choice of irrigation system. Stochastic Production Frontier models are then estimated for a sample of 371 Chilean wine grape growers. The results show that pressurized irrigation leads to higher production at all levels of water applied; however, at lower levels the impact on TVP is more pronounced. Shadow values calculated at observed output for pressurized and gravity systems are 0.026 USD m⁻³ and 0.033 USD m⁻³, respectively. Significant differences are found between low (0.046 USDm⁻³), medium (0.027 USD m⁻³) and high (0.018 USD m⁻³) levels of water applied. The average technical efficiency for the sample is 70.4% and there is no significant difference between growers using pressurized and gravity methods. Our findings suggest that irrigation water can be saved without compromising output, which has important implications for sustainability given that agriculture is the most water demanding sector in the world.  aPublisher supplied data 3agravity 3airrigation systems 3airrigation water 3awater management 3awater shortages 3awater use efficiency 3awine grapes 0aIrrigation water 0aShadow values 0aStochastic production frontier 0aTechnical efficiency 0aWine grapes 0aChile1 aJara-Rojas, Roberto1 aBravo-Ureta, Boris1 aEngler, Alejandra0 tAgricultural water management.g2022 Sept. 01, v. 271 p.107766-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8460x0378-37747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2022.1077663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02937naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005500151245015700206520147200363592002801835650002301863650002001886650001301906650001801919650002401937650002201961651001001983653001301993653001502006653001102021653001302032653002102045653002702066700005802093700001602151700001302167700001502180700001802195700005502213700001502268773011302283856008602396852000902482655001202491IND60764019920221116141721.0220517e20220310xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076401992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.1306212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, You-Hai1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6511-990810aUnderstanding regional mobility resilience and its relationship with regional culture during the COVID-19 pandemic: A pathogen-stress theory perspective  aThe global COVID-19 pandemic has severely impacted the passenger flow. Facing the same pandemic, various regions differ in the resilience of population mobility due to differences in the regional cultural. This study uses mobile big data to quantifies regional mobility resilience of 358 cities in China. Study results reveal the differences in regional mobility resilience of cities through spatial autocorrelation analysis, and verify the effects of regional culture on mobility resilience using a panel logit regression model based on pathogen-stress theory. Spatial heterogeneity and autocorrelation in the regional mobility resilience of Chinese cities are identified through spatial analysis, which are manifested by various hot spots over time. Moreover, the panel regression results indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic has a significant negative effect on regional mobility resilience; and that the negative effect of COVID-19 on regional mobility resilience is amplified in the cities with high degrees of dialect diversity, while it is weakened in the cities with high degrees of cultural tightness (which have strict norms and punishments for deviance). This study provides theoretical implications for mobility resilience in the context of COVID-19 and advances the pathogen-stress theory. Study findings also provide practical recommendations for regions to enhance regional mobility resilience under the challenges of future public health crisis events.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aautocorrelation 3apandemic 3apublic health 3aregression analysis 3aspatial variation 3aChina 0aMobility 0aResilience 0aCities 0aCOVID-19 0aRegional culture 0aPathogen-stress theory1 aZhang, Honglei1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0609-60501 aZhuang, Min1 aHu, Meng1 aZhang, Chi1 aPan, Jingxian1 aLiu, Peixue1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9846-47211 aZhang, Jie0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2022 Mar. 10, v. 339 p.130621-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.1306213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02122naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245015900160300002000319520087600339592002801215650001301243650001101256650002301267650002201290650002201312650001001334650001201344650001601356650001401372650001101386650001601397650001701413650001801430700001901448700001801467700002001485773012401505856007401629852000901703655001201712IND60667198920221120183333.0190919e20150306xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066719892DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra15602a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, Seung-Yeol10aLow-cost & low-temperature curable solution-processed silica-based nanostructured antireflective coatings on CuIn₁₋ₓGaₓSe₂ thin film solar cells  ap. 24712-24717.  aA simple, low-cost and low-temperature curable silica-based antireflective coating (ARC) deposited by a solution-based process has been investigated for Cu(In,Ga)Se₂ (CIGS) solar cells for the first time. Thin-layer nanostructured ARCs featuring 20–30 nm SiO₂ NPs were fabricated from a simple, low-cost chemical solution. The silica-based nanostructured ARCs were deposited on a glass substrate and on CIGS solar cells. The nanostructured ARCs on glass could increase the transmittance by 3.9%. The nanostructured ARCs could reduce the reflectance of CIGS solar cells by 4.96%. The nanostructured ARCs on CIGS solar cells resulted in an enhancement of solar energy conversion efficiency from 16.0% to 17.2%. These enhancements confirm the utility of these simple nanostructured ARCs as a cost-effective solution for photon management in thin film CIGS solar cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoatings 3acopper 3acost effectiveness 3aenergy conversion 3afilms (materials) 3aglass 3aphotons 3areflectance 3aselenides 3asilica 3asolar cells 3asolar energy 3atransmittance1 aPan, Changqing1 aKim, Dae-Hwan1 aZhang, Zhihong,0 tRSC advances.g2015 Mar. 06, v. 5, no. 31 p.24712-24717dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ra15602a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02853naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245009600167506011700263506007600380520115100456592002801607506003701635650001501672650001001687650000901697650001801706650002001724650002001744650002101764650002801785650002201813650001501835650001901850650001801869650001201887650001701899650002101916650002201937653001201959653001501971653002201986653000902008653001402017700002002031700002202051700002002073700002102093773010602114856008202220852000902302655001202311IND60767747720221207093500.0220507e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076774772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.psj.2022.1017892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOlson, Elena G.10aApplication of microbial analyses to feeds and potential implications for poultry nutrition  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPoultry nutrition and feed manufacturing are interrelated for a variety of reasons. Diet formulation is essential for optimizing bird growth and feed conversion, but compositional differences and the presence of certain feed additives can alter the gastrointestinal microbial composition and functionality. Not only does dietary composition and digestibility influence poultry performance, but specific physical characteristics such as feed particle size and thermal treatments can impact the avian gastrointestinal tract (GIT) microbiota. Poultry feeds also have a characteristic microbial ecology consisting of pathogenic and nonpathogenic microorganisms. Some feed-borne pathogens such as Salmonella are well studied and linked with the colonization of birds consuming the feed. However, much less is known about the nonpathogenic feed microbiome and what impact that might have on the bird's GIT. This review discusses the potential interaction between poultry feed and the GIT microbiome, microbial ecology of feed, application of microbiome analyses to feed, and approaches for communicating these complex data sets to the poultry industry.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSalmonella 3abirds 3adiet 3adigestibility 3adigestive tract 3afeed conversion 3afood composition 3agastrointestinal system 3amicrobial ecology 3amicrobiome 3amicroorganisms 3aparticle size 3apoultry 3apoultry feed 3apoultry industry 3apoultry nutrition 0apoultry 0amicrobiome 0amicrobial ecology 0afeed 0anutrition1 aDittoe, Dana K.1 aJendza, Joshua A.1 aStock, David A.1 aRicke, Steven C.0 tPoultry science.g2022 May, v. 101, no. 5 p.101789-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45501x0032-57917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.psj.2022.1017893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02746naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002500149245012600174300001600300520138800316592002801704650002401732650002301756650001601779650001201795650001801807650001801825650002401843650001301867650001601880653002301896653001601919653002001935653001301955653002201968653002101990653000902011700002402020700002302044700002802067773011302095856008302208852000902291655001202300IND60599050420221120072707.0180702e20140715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059905042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ydbio.2014.04.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRamsbottom, Simon A.10aSulf1 influences the Shh morphogen gradient during the dorsal ventral patterning of the neural tube in Xenopus tropicalis  ap. 207-218.  aGenetic studies have established that heparan sulphate proteoglycans (HSPGs) are required for signalling by key developmental regulators, including Hedgehog, Wnt/Wg, FGF, and BMP/Dpp. Post-synthetic remodelling of heparan sulphate (HS) by Sulf1 has been shown to modulate these same signalling pathways. Sulf1 codes for an N-acetylglucosamine 6-O-endosulfatase, an enzyme that specifically removes the 6-O sulphate group from glucosamine in highly sulfated regions of HS chains. One striking aspect of Sulf1 expression in all vertebrates is its co-localisation with that of Sonic hedgehog in the floor plate of the neural tube. We show here that Sulf1 is required for normal specification of neural progenitors in the ventral neural tube, a process known to require a gradient of Shh activity. We use single-cell injection of mRNA coding for GFP-tagged Shh in early Xenopus embryos and find that Sulf1 restricts ligand diffusion. Moreover, we find that the endogenous distribution of Shh protein in Sulf1 knockdown embryos is altered, where a less steep ventral to dorsal gradient forms in the absence of Sulf1, resulting in more a diffuse distribution of Shh. These data point to an important role for Sulf1 in the ventral neural tube, and suggests a mechanism whereby Sulf1 activity shapes the Shh morphogen gradient by promoting ventral accumulation of high levels of Shh protein.  aPublisher supplied data 3aN-acetylglucosamine 3aXenopus tropicalis 3aglucosamine 3aligands 3amessenger RNA 3aproteoglycans 3asignal transduction 3asulfates 3avertebrates 0aNeural progenitors 0aDevelopment 0aCell signalling 0aHedgehog 0a6-O-endosulfatase 0aHeparan sulphate 0aHSPG1 aMaguire, Richard J.1 aFellgett, Simon W.1 aPownall, Mary Elizabeth0 tDevelopmental biology.g2014 July 15, v. 391, no. 2 p.207-218dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12382x0012-16067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ydbio.2014.04.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02429naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245009500157300002000252520128100272592002801553650002201581650002801603650001301631650001801644650001301662650001501675650001601690650001501706650001601721700001701737700002201754700002101776700001901797700001901816773012501835856007401960852000902034655001202043IND60666918720221120040809.0190919e20141106xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066691872DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra10268a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYen, Chia-Te10aCharge transfer highways in polymer solar cells embedded with imprinted PEDOT:PSS gratings  ap. 58342-58348.  aThis study presents the developed poly(3-hexylthiophene):indene-C₆₀ bisadduct (P3HT:ICBA)-based organic solar cells, where nanoimprinted poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) gratings successfully functioned as charge transport highways and induced an ICBA-rich surface. The embedded nanostructures improved light harvesting and contact area; however, these two factors were not the primary enhancers of solar cell performance. Atomic force microscopy and conductive atomic force microscopy revealed that the imprinted PEDOT:PSS gratings activated hole- and electron-conducting pathways. This result can be attributed to the enhancement of the π–π orbital overlap between P3HT and PEDOT:PSS polymer chains and to the grating-induced ICBA phase separation. These two effects were the primary factors that increased the short-circuit current of the imprinted devices, which resulted in the increase of power conversion efficiency. In-plane and out-of-plane grazing incident X-ray diffraction revealed that the chain orientation of P3HT on the PEDOT:PSS gratings was the same as that on the plane PEDOT:PSS surface. This study proved the feasibility of nanoimprinting for organic solar cells, as well as for organic field-effect transistors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aatomic force microscopy 3ahighways 3ananomaterials 3apolymers 3aseparation 3asolar cells 3asulfonates 3atransistors1 aWu, Fu-Chiao1 aCheng, Horng-Long1 aSheu, Hwo-Shuenn1 aTang, Fu-Ching1 aZhou, Weiyang,0 tRSC advances.g2014 Nov. 06, v. 4, no. 102 p.58342-58348dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ra10268a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02613naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006200151245008500213520132600298592002801624650002101652650001901673650000901692650001101701650002101712650000901733651001001742651001101752653002201763653002101785653000801806653000901814653001501823653001601838700005701854700002201911700006201933773011301995856008602108852000902194655001202203IND60764020120221118110832.0220621e20220301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076402012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.1306232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRancilio, Giuliano1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7752-353710aLow-GHG culturally acceptable diets to reduce individual carbon footprint by 20%  aFor mitigating climate change and respect targets, humanity must decrease emissions as soon as possible: the later is the action, the harsher will be the trajectory of the mitigating pathway. Structural actions need time to become operational. Therefore, individual actions shall also enter into play, focusing on what has a high impact and whose change is at hand: food-related emissions build up 30% of total anthropogenic impacts and eating is an everyday activity. In this study, regional culturally acceptable low-carbon diets are proposed for China, Europe and US. They are developed considering the requirements of energy and nutrients supply, they respect regionality of food consumption – e.g., they include only foods that are diffused in the area – and they are aimed to limit the individual effort to be adopted – e.g., they include all the food categories, meat included. They are low-carbon since food items are selected on the basis of their lifecycle carbon footprint (CF). Eventually, the regionality constraints are relaxed to develop a World's low-carbon diet. For every area, we found a diet that halves the food-related CF. Instead, our World's low-carbon diet reduces the average food-related CF by 75%. Therefore, the overall individual CF would be reduced by a fifth in case of its adoption.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon footprint 3aclimate change 3adiet 3aenergy 3afood consumption 3ameat 3aChina 3aEurope 0aSustainable diets 0aCarbon footprint 0aLCA 0aFood 0aVegetarian 0aPescatarian1 aGibin, Davide1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5127-26101 aBlaco, Alessandro1 aCasagrandi, Renato1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5177-803X0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2022 Mar. 01, v. 338 p.130623-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.1306233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01677naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245017700155300001800332520048900350592002800839650002000867650001400887650002300901650002300924650002700947650000900974650000900983650001500992650001301007700001601020700001501036700001801051700001701069773013401086856007401220852000901294655001201303IND60639140520221120200846.0190501e20170711xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063914052DNAL7 a10.1039/c7cc02130e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Haitao10aMonodispersed gold nanoparticles supported on a zirconium-based porous metal–organic framework and their high catalytic ability for the reverse water–gas shift reaction  ap. 7953-7956.  aA highly active and selective Au@UIO-67 catalyst has been assembled.

We have demonstrated, along with other researchers, a reduced lipid turnover and fat oxidation rate in myotubes derived from obese donors with and without type 2 diabetes (T2D). Because exercise is known to increase fat oxidative capacity in skeletal muscle, we investigated if in vitro exercise could restore primary defects in lipid handling in myotubes of obese individuals with and without T2D compared with lean nondiabetic donors. Primary myotubes cultures were derived from biopsies of lean, obese, and T2D subjects. One single bout of long-duration exercise was mimicked in vitro by electrical pulse stimulation (EPS) for 24 h. Lipid handling was measured using radiolabeled palmitate, metabolic gene expression by real-time qPCR, and proteins by Western blot. We first showed that myotubes from obese and T2D donors had increased uptake and incomplete oxidation of palmitate. This was associated with reduced mitochondrial respiratory chain complex II, III, and IV protein expression in myotubes from obese and T2D subjects. EPS stimulated palmitate oxidation in lean donors, while myotubes from obese and T2D donors were refractory to this effect. Interestingly, EPS increased total palmitate uptake in myotubes from lean donors while myotubes from T2D donors had a reduced rate of palmitate uptake into complex lipids and triacylglycerols. Novelty Myotubes from obese and T2D donors are characterized by primary defects in palmitic acid handling. Both obese and T2D myotubes are partially refractory to the beneficial effect of exercise on lipid handling.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern blotting 3abiopsy 3aelectron transport chain 3aexercise 3agene expression 3alipid metabolism 3amitochondria 3amyotubes 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3aoxidation 3apalmitates 3apalmitic acid 3aprotein synthesis 3aproteins 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aradiolabeling 3askeletal muscle 3atriacylglycerols 0ahuman myotubes 0ain vitro exercise 0aobesity 0aT2D1 aRustan, Arild C.1 aLaurens, Claire1 aThoresen, G.

The ion mobility spectrometer presented here was optimized for flow rates customarily used in high‐performance liquid chromatography between 100 and 1500 μL/min. The characterization of the system with respect to such parameters as the peak capacity of each time dimension and of the 2D spectrum was carried out based on a separation of a pesticide mixture containing 24 substances. While the total ion current chromatogram is coarsely resolved, exhibiting coelutions for a number of compounds, all substances can be separately detected in the 2D plane due to the orthogonality of the separations in retention and drift dimensions. Another major advantage of the ion mobility detector is the identification of substances based on their characteristic mobilities. Electrospray ionization allows the detection of substances lacking a chromophore. As an example, the separation of a mixture of 18 amino acids is presented. A software built upon the free mass spectrometry package OpenMS was developed for processing the extensive 2D data. The different processing steps are implemented as separate modules which can be arranged in a graphic workflow facilitating automated processing of data.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acids 3acomputer software 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ainformation processing 3aionization 3amass spectrometry 3aspectrometers1 aRiebe, Daniel1 aBeitz, Toralf1 aLöhmannsröben, Hans‐Gerd1 aAndreotti, Sandro1 aReinert, Knut1 aZenichowski, Karl1 aDiener, M.q(Marc),0 tJournal of separation science.g2016 Dec., v. 39, no. 24 p.4756-4764dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3924049x1615-93067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jssc.2016007493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02279naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245007700168520114600245592002801391650002201419650002001441650001501461650003401476650001501510653002301525653001501548653001801563653002901581700006001610700006301670773011301733856008601846852000901932655001201941IND60764020320221116141636.0220621e20220301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076402032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.1306262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKang, Hyewon10aGovernance of local food systems: Current research and future directions  aSocial, economic, and environmental concerns have boosted interest in local food systems as well as alternative or transitional models of food production, distribution, and consumption. Recent studies suggest that more attention is needed to uncover aspects of the governance of these transitional models. In this systematic literature review, we attempt to close this gap by reviewing 55 papers from 2010 to 2020. Using frameworks borrowed from the public administration literature on collaborative governance, we explore the main elements of collaborative governance, including leadership, collaboration processes, starting conditions, and institutional designs. We then suggest opportunities for future research in the study of local food systems. The literature also accounts for key factors that facilitate or make collaboration difficult. Our findings indicate that the local food systems literature is rich in descriptions of actors and alternative institutional designs. However, far less research addresses leadership in local food supply chains and how we should measure outcomes. We conclude with suggestions for further research.  aPublisher supplied data 3afood availability 3afood production 3agovernance 3agovernment and administration 3aleadership 0aLocal food systems 0aGovernance 0aSupply chains 0aCollaborative governance1 aRoggio, April M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4640-61831 aLuna-Reyes, Luis F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0852-404X0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2022 Mar. 01, v. 338 p.130626-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.1306263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03731naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245016000166520221100326592002802537650001302565650001502578650000902593650002802602650002602630650001602656650001402672650001702686650001702703650002102720650002302741650002102764650002502785651001002810653001202820653003302832653003202865653002002897653002502917700001802942700001802960700001502978700001802993700001603011773011703027856008403144852000903228655001203237IND60779828220221123005336.0220816e20220901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077982822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agwat.2022.1077692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Shibo10aOptimizing plastic mulching improves the growth and increases grain yield and water use efficiency of spring maize in dryland of the Loess Plateau in China  aTransparent plastic film mulching (PFM) with flat cropping cultivation has been widely applied to grow maize (Zea mays L.) in dryland agricultural production areas of the Loess Plateau in China. However, with global warming-induced gradual increase in soil temperature, film-mulched spring maize experiences premature senescence and yield loss. In this study, a new form of mulching strategy involving dual mulching of transparent plastic film with whole maize stalks in a flat plot was established to improve growth and increase water use efficiency (WUE), precipitation use efficiency (PUE), and spring maize yield. The field experiment was conducted in 20 182 019, and 2020 on a conventional flat plot without mulching (CK), a flat plot with single transparent PFM, and a flat plot of transparent film mulching with whole maize stalks (PFM+ST) in the dryland of the Loess Plateau in China, to quantify the effects of different treatments on soil hydrothermal conditions, maize phenology, plant growth dynamics, WUE, PUE, and maize yield. Results demonstrated that soil water storage (SWS) at 0–100 cm soil layer in PFM and PFM+ST were significantly superior to those in CK, but SWS did not significantly differ between PFM and PFM+ST. Soil temperature under PFM+ST at 0–25 cm soil layer decreased by 1.2 ℃ compared with that under PFM during growth, especially in early growing seasons (20–60 days after sowing [DAS]). PFM+ST extended vegetative and reproductive growth periods by 1–2 and 6–7 days compared with those in PFM, respectively. In later growth period (80–120 DAS), PFM+ST increased the root dry matter weight, SPAD, and LAI and significantly increased the aboveground dry matter accumulation. PFM+ST significantly increased the 100-kernel dry weight, grain yield, WUE, and PUE. PFM+ST had 3-year average grain yields of 10.82% and 36.48% greater than PFM and CK, respectively. The corresponding WUE and in 0–200 cm soil layer improved by 12.55% and 39.84%, and PUE improved by 10.82% and 36.48%, respectively. With global warming, applying PFM+ST cultivation practice effectively extended growth period and increased mulching spring maize yield and WUE in the study site.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZea mays 3aarid lands 3acorn 3adry matter accumulation 3afield experimentation 3agrain yield 3aphenology 3aplant growth 3aplastic film 3asoil temperature 3asoil water storage 3awater management 3awater use efficiency 3aChina 0aDryland 0aDual mulching with flat plot 0aSoil hydrothermal condition 0aMaize phenology 0aWater use efficiency1 aZhang, Guixin1 aXia, Zhenqing1 aWu, Mengke1 aBai, Jingxuan1 aLu, Haidong0 tAgricultural water management.g2022 Sept. 01, v. 271 p.107769-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8460x0378-37747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2022.1077693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03105naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001900144245015800163300001200321520185800333592002802191650001802219650002102237650002002258650002602278650001402304650001702318650001202335650002202347650001802369650001902387650001602406650002002422650001002442650002102452651001502473773013202488856007802620852000902698655001202707IND60682845220221118011748.0200203s2020    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068284522DNAL7 a10.1139/apnm-2019-08632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aManyanga, Taru10aExamining lifestyle behaviours and weight status of primary schoolchildren: using Mozambique to explore the data gaps in low- and middle-income countries  ap. 220.  aThe emergency of malnutrition and physical inactivity among children as serious public health challenges in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) is concerning and requires urgent attention. The main objective of this dissertation was to examine relationships between lifestyle behaviours and weight status among schoolchildren in Mozambique and use findings to highlight important data gaps that exist in LMICs. Narrative literature searches conducted identified data gaps and research needs. A published protocol was used for this dissertation (n = 683) to facilitate data comparability. Anthropometric and accelerometry data were objectively measured while data about lifestyle behaviours and environmental factors were collected using context-adapted questionnaires. As part of this dissertation, 6 manuscripts were developed and submitted for publication in peer-reviewed scientific journals. Results showed a dearth of information and that overweight/obesity is an emerging public health concern, especially among urban children. Moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity (MVPA), active transport, and maternal body mass index (BMI) were important modifiable correlates of weight status for Mozambican children. Distinct differences in prevalences of lifestyle behaviours were observed between urban and rural children in Mozambique. Compared with children from 12 other countries, children from Mozambique had lower BMI, higher daily MVPA, lower daily sedentary time, and comparable sleep duration. Linear distributions of study site-specific BMI, minutes of daily MVPA, and daily sedentary time by country human development index were observed. Findings revealed important differences between urban and rural children, supporting the need to include both in study samples and especially in LMICs where most people live in rural areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaccelerometry 3aactive transport 3abody mass index 3aenvironmental factors 3alifestyle 3amalnutrition 3aobesity 3aphysical activity 3apublic health 3aquestionnaires 3arural areas 3aschool children 3asleep 3aurban population 3aMozambique0 tApplied physiology, nutrition and metabolism.g2020, v. 45, no. 2 p.220-220dNRC Research PresswJournal:23115x1715-53207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/apnm-2019-08633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02755naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001600146245009300162300001800255520142300273592002801696650001701724650001801741650002501759650001301784650002601797650001101823650001301834650001901847650001101866650001501877650001101892700001801903700001601921700001701937700001401954700001801968700001901986700005602005773017102061856008002232852000902312655001202321IND60686759220221122224513.0200318e20200220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068675922DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.9b065202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Yumin10aReprocessable Epoxy Resins Based on Hydroxy-Thioester and Thiol-Thioester Dual Exchanges  ap. 4936-4944.  aEpoxy resins are widely used due to their excellent physical and mechanical properties; however, their recycle and reprocessing remain challenging up to now. This problem may be solved by incorporating dynamic covalent cross-links into epoxy resins, and thus they have the potential to increase their service lifetimes and reduce their environmental impact. This work innovatively proposes the introducing of thioester groups into epoxy resins. Under proper conditions, the thioester will exchange with the hydroxyl groups of epoxy E51, which will produce thiol and ester groups. Then, the thiol-thioester exchange will be triggered subsequently. The proposed hydroxyl-thioester and thiol-thioester dual exchanges endow the epoxy materials with reprocessability. We designed model experiments to demonstrate the exchange capacity of hydroxyls/thioesters and thiols/thioesters under mild conditions. New epoxy resin materials have been developed based on thioester-containing curing agents. The reprocessing of the thioester-containing epoxy resin was very simple and efficient. After three reprocessing cycles, the mechanical properties of the epoxy resin material were comparable to the pristine material. In addition, the reprocessing epoxy materials had excellent shape memory properties. This work provides new ideas for the development of epoxy resins and opens up a new pathway for the application of thioesters.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrosslinking 3acuring agents 3aenvironmental impact 3aepoxides 3amechanical properties 3amodels 3amoieties 3aprocess design 3aresins 3athioesters 3athiols1 aSong, Qingfei1 aLi, Chunmei1 aTan, Jiaojun1 aXue, Ying1 aSu, Zhengzhou1 aZhang, Guoxian1 aZhang, Qiuyu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4823-50310 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2020 Feb. 20, v. 59, no. 11 p.4936-4944dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.9b065203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02844naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003300150245009200183300001600275520134700291592002801638650002001666650001601686650002601702650001501728650001601743650001901759650001301778650002201791650001901813650001201832650002301844650003301867650002501900650000901925650001701934650001901951653001401970653001501984653003301999653003302032653003002065700002002095700001902115700002402134773012002158856005102278852000902329655001202338IND50086916520221119075340.0140412e20111201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008691652DNAL7 a10.1080/17480272.2011.6224112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWelzbacher, Christian Robert10aMicrostructure, strength and structural integrity of heat-treated beech and spruce wood  ap. 219-227.  aHeat treatment of wood is an effective method by which to improve the dimensional stability and biological durability, but the mechanical strength is decreased at the same time. Besides chemical modification of cell-wall constituents, physical weakening of the microstructure owing to heat-induced defects may also contribute to strength loss. Therefore, anatomical properties of heat-treated beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) and spruce (Picea abies Karst.), studied by light microscopic and scanning electron microscopic analysis, and their interrelation with strength properties and structural integrity were investigated. For determination of structural integrity, the high-energy–multiple-impact (HEMI) test was applied. Microscopic analyses showed frequent formation of radial cracks in heat-treated beech close to the rays as well as tangential cracks in the latewood of spruce. In addition, the modulus of rupture was more affected by the heat treatments than the resistance to impact milling (RIM) determined by the HEMI test, because RIM is based on multiple fractures on the microlevel that are not affected by the formation of intercellular cracks or other defects due to the heat treatment. It was concluded that heat-induced defects in the wood microstructure contribute to the substantial strength loss of thermally modified timber.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFagus sylvatica 3aPicea abies 3adimensional stability 3adurability 3aengineering 3aheat treatment 3alatewood 3amaterials science 3amicrostructure 3amilling 3amodulus of rupture 3ascanning electron microscopy 3astrength (mechanics) 3awood 3awood defects 3awood treatment 0aHEMI test 0amicroscopy 0aresistance to impact milling 0ascanning electron microscopy 0athermally modified timber1 aRassam, Ghonche1 aTalaei, Aisona1 aBrischke, Christian0 tWood material science and engineering.g2011 Dec. 1, v. 6, no. 4 p.219-227dTaylor & Francis Groupx1748-02807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17480272.2011.622411  aDNAL 7aarticle03367naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100003800139245011900177300001600296500002000312520162300332592002801955596007301983596006802056596008502124596008502209650001702294650001502311650002302326650001302349650001402362650001002376650001102386650001902397650001202416650001802428650001002446650002002456650001702476650002502493650001902518650001002537700006502547700006302612773011602675856007302791852000902864655001202873IND60708011620221117210633.0200821e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070801162DNAL7 a10.1111/aec.128912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAncco Valdivia, Fernando Geronimo10aDifferences in size and energy content affect the territorial status and mating success of a neotropical dragonfly  ap. 748-758.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIn male odonates, both size and fat content are related to territory defence and mating success. Males that are larger and have higher energy reserves win relatively more disputes for territory and attract more females. Wing colour has also been regarded as a mechanism that influences agonistic behaviour between males, as wing pigmentation might be regarded as a sign of male quality. In this study, we analysed whether a set of male physical (body size and wing colour), physiological (body fat content) and behavioural (disputes between males) characteristics were involved in the territory defence and mating behaviour of the neotropical dragonfly Zenithoptera lanei Santos, 1941 (Anisoptera: Libellulidae). Males were characterised as territorial whenever they warded‐off other males and remained in the same place within the pond for two consecutive days. In general, these territorial males were larger and had more abdominal and thoracic fat, engaged in pursuits more frequently, spent more time on sexual behaviour and female guarding, and mated more in comparison to subordinate males. By evaluating whether the percentage of wing area covered by black ink influenced male behaviour, we found that territorial males tended to act aggressively towards other males whose wings were partially painted, and sexually towards females irrespective of wing area painted. In Z. lanei, both body size and fat content play a role in defining territoriality. By subduing competitors and dominating preferred locations within high‐quality sites, these males are likely to be visited by females and engage in mating.  aPublisher supplied data  aFAVcCoordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior  aPPMcFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais  a304069/2018‐3cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico  a400748/2016‐9cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico 3aLibellulidae 3aNeotropics 3aagonistic behavior 3abody fat 3abody size 3acolor 3aenergy 3aenergy content 3afemales 3alipid content 3amales 3amating behavior 3apigmentation 3areproductive success 3aterritoriality 3awings1 aAlves-Silva, Estevão1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1650-86051 aDel‐Claro, Kleber1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8886-95680 tAustral ecology.g2020 Sept., v. 45, no. 6 p.748-758dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl59958x1442-99857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/aec.128913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01453naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006000140245016900200300001800369520035100387592002800738650001200766650001800778650001300796650001100809650002300820700001800843700002000861700001500881700001500896773013300911856007401044852000901118655001201127IND60639140820221120200741.0190501e20170511xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063914082DNAL7 a10.1039/c7cc02140b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWenThese authors contributed equally to this work., Xin10aLigand-free nickel-catalyzed semihydrogenation of alkynes with sodium borohydride: a highly efficient and selective process for cis-alkenes under ambient conditions  ap. 5372-5375.  aWe report a low-cost and efficient catalytic system, involving in situ generated ligand-free Ni NPs, methanol and sodium borohydride, for the semihydrogenation of alkynes under ambient conditions.

Male adult Wistar rats (180–210 g) were randomized into 6 groups (n = 15) as follows: (i) control, (ii) ulcerated untreated (UU), (iii) KV alone (KVA), (iv) KV + ulcer (KVU), (v) ulcer + KV (UKV), and (vi) ulcer + omeprazole (20 mg/kg). Ulcer was induced through ischemia/reperfusion method after 2 weeks of daily oral KV (100 mg/kg). Rats were weighed daily, and gastric acid secretion, ulcer scores, hematological, biochemical, and histological variables were assessed 1 h after induction at 3 and 7 days post-ulceration. Body weight decreased in KVA (179.1 ± 1.6 g), and KVU (170.1 ± 2.2 g) compared with UU (199.0 ± 1.4 g). Gastric acid secretion decreased significantly in KVU after 1 h and 3 days post-ulceration (0.27 ± 0.03 mEq/L; 0.49 ± 0.02 mEq/L) compared with UU (0.60 ± 0.06 mEq/L; 0.85 ± 0.29 mEq/L), respectively. There was significant reduction in neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio of KVA (0.29 ± 0.06) and KVU (0.35 ± 0.02) compared with UU (0.54 ± 0.04). Malondialdehyde level decreased significantly with concomitant increase in anti-oxidative activities and nitric oxide level in the KV treated groups (KVA, KVU, UKV) compared with UU. In conclusion, treatment with KV protects the stomach by reducing gastric acid secretion, promoting antioxidant activity and suppressing action of reactive oxygen species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGarcinia kola 3aadults 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3aantioxidant activity 3abody weight 3agastric acid 3ahistology 3aischemia 3alaboratory animals 3amales 3amalondialdehyde 3aneutrophils 3anitric oxide 3arats 3areperfusion injury 3asecretion 3astomach 0agastric ulcer 0akolaviron 0agastro-protection 0aischemia-reperfusion 0arat1 aSalami, Adeola Temitope1 aAshaolu, Onaara Peter1 aAdegoke, Adeoti Gbemisola1 aOlaleye, Samuel Babafemi0 tApplied physiology, nutrition and metabolism.g2018, v. 43, no. 1 p.30-37dNRC Research PresswJournal:23115x1715-53207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/apnm-2017-01383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02111naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245006000173300001400233520112400247592002801371650002001399650002201419650000901441650000901450650002201459653003001481653002401511653001901535700002101554700002001575773011801595856005101713852000901764655001201773IND50086916720221119074932.0140412e20120301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008691672DNAL7 a10.1080/17480272.2011.6371322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStroble, Martin F.10aWood construction platform design using instrumentation  ap. 13-24.  aConstruction platforms have been used for a variety of applications since the 1960s and are most commonly used to support heavy machinery over, at best, marginal soils. Wood construction platforms are common, although they are not typically thought of as engineered products. The objective of this paper was to develop a design method for freestanding wood construction platforms placed on the ground and loaded with two interior concentric loads. The design method was developed using instrumented test data from 52 wood construction platforms representing four wood types and seven platform geometries. The design method uses load, deflection and strain data of the wood coupled with properties of the supporting soil. The method compared favourably to a propriety wood construction platform design approach, and to an accepted method of designing cribbing for cranes (other methods were not identified in the literature). The more customary approach in current practice appears to be using a concrete slab on grade design method. Discussion related to the negative aspects of this technique is provided in the paper.  aPublisher supplied data 3ainstrumentation 3amaterials science 3asoil 3awood 3awood construction 0aComposite timber products 0atimber construction 0awood mechanics1 aHoward, Isaac L.1 aShmulsky, Rubin0 tWood material science and engineering.g2012 Mar. 1, v. 7, no. 1 p.13-24dTaylor & Francis Groupx1748-02807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17480272.2011.637132  aDNAL 7aarticle03473naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006100151245014200212520181800354592002802172650001702200650002102217650001902238650001402257650002502271650001902296650001202315650001502327650001602342650003302358650002502391650001902416650001102435650002502446651001202471653003102483653004002514653002402554653002102578653004402599653002202643700005802665700002902723700001902752773011302771856008602884852000902970655001202979IND60764020820221116141614.0220621e20220301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076402082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.1306312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIvanica, Raphaela1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4437-639510aDevelopment of a life cycle inventory database and life cycle impact assessment of the building demolition stage: A case study in Germany  aThe implementation of a circular economy in the construction sector is intended to reduce the environmental impact as well as the construction and demolition (C&D) waste generated. In most life cycle assessment (LCA) studies, the end-of-life (EoL) stage, specifically the demolition stage, is not included because only a marginal influence on the environmental impacts of a building's life cycle is assumed. This study aims to develop a life cycle inventory (LCI) database of the building's demolition stages. By applying the methodology of scientific observation, the demolition processes of five detached and semi-detached buildings located in the south of Germany were attended to record case study specific inventory data, which were then structured in a database. To evaluate the environmental impacts of the demolition stage, a life cycle impact assessment and hotspot analysis were conducted. The main influencing factors of the demolition stage are excavator operation, direct freshwater consumption and related wastewater treatment, as well as container utilization for C&D waste collection and sorting. With a share of 91–95%, excavator operation contributes the most to the impact categories climate change potential, fossil depletion, and freshwater eutrophication. The structure of the database and its user interface allow integration of an LCA calculation into the early design stage and the use of the data for renovation work. The compiled LCI data for the demolition process enables the integration of the demolition stage into the LCAs of a building and allows the calculation of project-specific environmental impacts. Besides, the LCI data is important for conducting environmental product declarations, since the EoL stage is mandatory according to the international standard DIN EN 15804.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3acircular economy 3aclimate change 3adatabases 3aenvironmental impact 3aeutrophication 3afossils 3afreshwater 3ainventories 3alife cycle impact assessment 3alife cycle inventory 3auser interface 3awastes 3awastewater treatment 3aGermany 0aLife cycle inventory (LCI) 0aLife cycle impact assessment (LCIA) 0aBuilding demolition 0aCircular economy 0aConstruction and demolition (C&D) waste 0aEnd-of-life (EoL)1 aRisse, Michael1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0091-93541 aWeber-Blaschke, Gabriele1 aRichter, Klaus0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2022 Mar. 01, v. 338 p.130631-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.1306313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02949naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005900153245009400212300001200306520137400318592002801692650001301720650002901733650001601762650001801778650002201796650001801818650001101836650002501847650001201872650001201884650002401896650001401920650001301934650001101947653003401958653002501992653002002017700001802037700002302055700006802078700005602146700006202202773010602264856008802370852000902458655001202467IND60633951620221122173935.0190628e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063395162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.forsciint.2019.02.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFerreira, Carla1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6317-451610aDevelopment of a high throughput methodology to screen cathinones’ toxicological impact  ap. 1-9.  aCurrent trend of novel psychoactive substances (NPS) among teenagers is posing new clinical, scientific and forensic societal questions. Synthetic cathinones are among the most consumed groups of NPS appearing on the street market and internet on a regular basis. The properties of these substances change regularly, due to structural modification to circumvent legislation. This practice makes almost impossible to characterize its toxicological profiles on an acceptable time scale, mostly due to the time-consuming experiments that must be held in animal models or human cells by standard methods. Such an issue demands the development of a rapid and inexpensive methodology to be used as a high-throughput screening of cathinones’ toxicity. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae shares highly conserved molecular and cellular mechanisms with human cells and has been used before for pharmacological drugs. In the present work it is proposed to use S. cerevisiae growth curves as a high throughput screening method to profile synthetic cathinones toxicity in a short time scale. The results obtained by S. cerevisiae growth curves analysis were compared to differentiated SH-SY5Y human neuronal cells and similar responses were found. The screening tool methodology has shown able to prioritize the most toxics NPS and can be useful for early warning programs on NPS.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aadolescents 3aanimal models 3aforensic sciences 3agrowth curves 3ahumans 3alaws and regulations 3amarkets 3aneurons 3apsychotropic agents 3ascreening 3atoxicity 3ayeasts 0aNovel psychoactive substances 0aSynthetic cathinones 0aHigh throughput1 aVaz, Ana Rita1 aFlorindo, Pedro R.1 aLopes de Chaves, Alvaro,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1034-70861 aBrites, Dora1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3024-97771 aQuintas, Alexandre1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5188-04530 tForensic science international.g2019 May, v. 298 p.1-9dElsevier B.V.wJournal:3523x0379-07387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.forsciint.2019.02.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03638naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245012900165506010400294506007600398520208100474592002802555506003702583650001202620650001902632650001502651650001502666650001302681650001502694650000902709650001402718650002302732650002002755651001202775653001602787653001902803653001802822653001202840653002302852700001802875700001802893700002002911700001702931773011302948856008603061852000903147655001203156IND60764020920221207071352.0220621e20220301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076402092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.1306332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Y.10aDiffuse water pollution during recent extreme wet-weather in the UK: Environmental damage costs and insight into the future?  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPeriods of extreme wet-weather elevate agricultural diffuse water pollutant loads and climate projections for the UK suggest wetter winters. Within this context, we monitored nitrate and suspended sediment loss using a field and landscape scale platform in SW England during the recent extreme wet-weather of 2019–2020. We compared the recent extreme wet-weather period to both the climatic baseline (1981–2010) and projected near- (2041–2060) and far- (2071–2090) future climates, using the 95th percentiles of conventional rainfall indices generated for climate scenarios downscaled by the LARS-WG weather generator from the 19 global climate models in the CMIP5 ensemble for the RCP8.5 emission scenario. Finally, we explored relationships between pollutant loss and the rainfall indices. Grassland field-scale monthly average nitrate losses increased from 0.39-1.07 kg ha⁻¹ (2016–2019) to 0.70–1.35 kg ha⁻¹ (2019–2020), whereas losses from grassland ploughed up for cereals, increased from 0.63-0.83 kg ha⁻¹ to 2.34–4.09 kg ha⁻¹. Nitrate losses at landscape scale increased during the 2019–2020 extreme wet-weather period to 2.04–4.54 kg ha⁻¹. Field-scale grassland monthly average sediment losses increased from 92-116 kg ha⁻¹ (2016–2019) to 281–333 kg ha⁻¹ (2019–2020), whereas corresponding losses from grassland converted to cereal production increased from 63-80 kg ha⁻¹ to 2124–2146 kg ha⁻¹. Landscape scale monthly sediment losses increased from 8-37 kg ha⁻¹ in 2018 to between 15 and 173 kg ha⁻¹ during the 2019–2020 wet-weather period. 2019–2020 was most representative of the forecast 95th percentiles of >1 mm rainfall for near- and far-future climates and this rainfall index was related to monitored sediment, but not nitrate, loss. The elevated suspended sediment loads generated by the extreme wet-weather of 2019–2020 therefore potentially provide some insight into the responses to the projected >1 mm rainfall extremes under future climates at the study location.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aclimate 3aclimate models 3agrasslands 3alandscapes 3anitrates 3apollutants 3arain 3asediments 3asuspended sediment 3awater pollution 3aEngland 0aWet-weather 0aClimate change 0aWater quality 0aNitrate 0aSuspended sediment1 aGranger, S.J.1 aSemenov, M.A.1 aUpadhayay, H.R.1 aCollins, Al,0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2022 Mar. 01, v. 338 p.130633-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.1306333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03286naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142100002000160245010300180300001800283520166800301592002801969650001501997650002202012650002702034650001702061650002102078650001902099650001302118650001002131650002102141650001202162650001602174650001202190650003302202650002202235650002102257650003102278650000902309650003502318650003302353650002602386700002502412700001802437700002602455700001602481700001702497700001802514773012202532856008102654852000902735655001202744IND4477385120221119230748.0120419e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447738512DNAL7 a217884262pmid7 a10.2527/jas.2011-40142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKjelland, M.

Semen samples from the same individuals were treated in 4 different ways: 1) chilled-extended sperm samples (without glycerol); 2) cryopreserved conventional samples, samples directly cryopreserved after the addition of extenders; 3) cryopreserved conventionally sorted samples, sorted samples to remove the dead sperm subpopulation; and 4) cryopreserved sex-sorted samples; sorted samples to remove the dead sperm subpopulation and separation of X- and Y-chromosome-bearing sperm. In all the cases (n = 6), conventional samples showed decreased postthaw motilities (43 ± 26%) when compared with X-sorted samples (59 ± 20%; P < 0.05) and Y-sorted samples (54 ± 20%; P > 0.05). The DNA fragmentation baseline was <5% for frozen-thawed conventional samples, but even less after sex sorting and conventional sorting: 2.4 and 1.7%, respectively. On the other hand, conventional samples showed greater (P < 0.05) DNA fragmentation than the sex-sorted sperm (n = 6) at 96 h (average of 4.8 ± 4.5% and 5.3 ± 4%, respectively). Conventionally sorted samples (n = 8) did not have greater (P > 0.05) DNA fragmentation when compared with the sex-sorted samples. Fragmentation of DNA on X-chromosome and Y-chromosome-bearing sorted sperm were not significantly different (n = 10, P > 0.05) after 96 h (2.6 ± 3.6% and 2.2 ± 0.5%, respectively). Future research should be implemented for examining the fertilizing potential of sex-sorted white-tailed deer sperm (e.g., AI fertility trials).  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA damage 3aDNA fragmentation 3aOdocoileus virginianus 3aX chromosome 3acryopreservation 3aflow cytometry 3aglycerol 3asemen 3asex preselection 3asorting 3aspermatozoa 2aAnimals 2aCryopreservationxveterinary 2aDNA Fragmentation 2aDeerxphysiology 2aFlow Cytometryxveterinary 2aMale 2aSemen Preservationxveterinary 2aSex Preselectionxveterinary 2aSpermatozoaxcytology1 aGonzález-Marín, C.1 aGosálvez, J.1 aLópez-Fernández, C.1 aLenz, R.

One of the failure modes of the containment system due to violent liquid loading inside the tank is bending the plywood plate. A systematic study of the plywood bending failure is conducted by means of experiments and finite element (FE) methods. The objective is to propose an FE model that can replicate the nonlinear tests results of the plywood bending failure. The FE software ABAQUS has been utilized as a basis for this study. The material is modelled by linear elasticity combined with damage initiation using Hashin's theory. The brittle behaviour is indicated by linear softening. The softening is modelled by a fracture energy approach. The sensitivity study of the damage parameter on ultimate bending load is conducted. The numerical results from FE models are compared with the test results. A nonlinear material and FE model of plywood that could demonstrate the brittle failure is proposed.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputer software 3aenergy 3aengineering 3afinite element analysis 3amodels 3anatural gas 3aplywood 3awood 0aFinite element method 0astrain measurement 0acomposite 0abrittle fracture1 aMoan, Torgeir0 tWood material science and engineering.g2012 Mar. 1, v. 7, no. 1 p.30-40dTaylor & Francis Groupx1748-02807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17480272.2011.647071  aDNAL 7aarticle02657naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245013100174300001600305520112300321592002801444650001801472650001501490650002401505650001401529650002601543650001701569650001601586650004101602650001801643650002001661650003301681650002301714650002301737650003201760653002101792653002101813653002801834653002301862700002301885700002601908700002001934700002701954773009901981856008602080852000902166655001202175IND60635608920221120075326.0190402e20180515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063560892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2017.12.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLieb, Veronika M.10aGC–MS profiling, descriptive sensory analysis, and consumer acceptance of Costa Rican papaya (Carica papaya L.) fruit purees  ap. 238-246.  aVolatiles of papaya purees from four Costa Rican cultivars were analysed by solid-phase microextraction and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. A total of 83 volatiles was assigned in the purees, of which 19 were detected for the first time as papaya constituents. As revealed by multivariate statistics, i.e., principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), the purees may be allocated to terpene- and lactone-rich (‘SH-5’), ester-containing (‘Criolla’), and intermediate chemotypes (‘Pococí’ and ‘Silvestre’). Descriptive sensory analysis and a consumer acceptance test were additionally performed. Floral, fruity, and honey-like notes were perceived at significantly higher intensities in ‘SH-5’ puree. The latter descriptors strongly correlated with volatiles discriminating ‘SH-5’ in the PCA and PLS-DA, respectively. Consumer acceptance of the papaya purees differed significantly. ‘Pococí’ and ‘SH-5’ purees appear to be suitable for improving the nutritional value of blended fruit juices without impairing their sensory quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCarica papaya 3achemotypes 3aconsumer acceptance 3acultivars 3adiscriminant analysis 3afruit juices 3afruit puree 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3aleast squares 3anutritive value 3aprincipal component analysis 3asensory evaluation 3asensory properties 3asolid phase microextraction 0aPuree processing 0aPapaya volatiles 0aMultivariate statistics 0aSemi-trained panel1 aEsquivel, Patricia1 aCubero Castillo, Elba1 aCarle, Reinhold1 aSteingass, Christof B.0 tFood chemistry.g2018 May 15, v. 248 p.238-246dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2017.12.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01877naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245015700153300001800310520078300328592002801111650001101139650001301150650002401163650001101187650002201198650001401220650001601234650000801250700001201258700001201270700001501282700001301297773012201310856007401432852000901506655001201515IND60667199920221120172804.0190919e20150112xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066719992DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra15622f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, T.10aConcurrence of de-alloying and re-alloying in a ternary Al₆₇Cu₁₈Sn₁₅ alloy and the fabrication of 3D nanoporous Cu–Sn composite structures  ap. 9574-9580.  aWe report the concurrence of de-alloying and re-alloying in a ternary Al₆₇Cu₁₈Sn₁₅ alloy (at.%) de-alloyed in a 5 wt% hydrochloric acid (HCl) solution at 70 ± 2 °C, and the fabrication of three-dimensional (3D) nanoporous Cu₃Sn–Cu–Cu₆Sn₅ composites in the form of self-supporting foils.

Cell viability induced by quercetin, luteolin and combination of these compounds with 5-FU were determined by MTT assay, also Cell death detection Elisa assay and fluorescence microscopy were performed to investigate apoptotic effects. Hu-VEGF Elisa assay was employed to determine the effects of treatments on angiogenesis. Western blot and qRT-PCR analysis were performed to investigate effects on p53, Bax, Bcl-2, p38 MAPK, mTOR, PTEN, and Akt proteins and genes. The results indicated that quercetin, luteolin and combinations of these compounds with 5-FU inhibited the growth of HT 29 cells. Compared to the control, apoptosis were triggered 8.1 and 10.1 fold in HT-29 cells, that treated with quercetin + 5-FU and luteolin + 5-FU, respectively. VEGF amount significantly decreased by combined treatments. qRT-PCR and western blot results demonstrated that quercetin, luteolin and the combinations of these flavonoids with 5-FU, modulate the apoptotic pathways in HT-29 cells. The increase in p53, Bax, p38 MAPK, and PTEN gene expression levels compared to the control group was 1.71, 1.42, 3.26, and 3.29-fold with 5-FU + L treatment, respectively, while this increase was 8.43, 1.65, 3.55, and 3.54-fold with 5-FU + Q treatment, respectively. In addition, when the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2, mTOR, and Akt gene expression levels were normalized as 1 in the control group, they were 0.28, 0.41, and 0.22 with 5-FU + L treatment, and 0.32, 0.46, and 0.39, respectively, with 5-FU + Q treatment. These findings suggested that quercetin and luteolin synergistically enhanced the anticancer effect of 5-FU in HT 29 cells and may therefore minimize the toxic effects of 5-FU in the clinical treatment of colorectal cancer.  aThe present study was supported by The Scientific Research Projects Coordination Unit of Ataturk University (Project no: AUBAP2013-292) and The Scientific Research Projects Coordination Unit of Bingol University (Project no: BAP-FEF.2017.00.010).  aPublisher supplied data  aAUBAP2013-292  aBAP-FEF.2017.00.010 3aWestern blotting 3aadenocarcinoma 3aangiogenesis 3aantineoplastic activity 3aapoptosis 3acell viability 3acolorectal neoplasms 3afluorescence microscopy 3afluorouracil 3agene expression 3ahumans 3aluteolin 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3amodels 3anutrition 3aquercetin 3atoxicity 3atoxicity testing1 aAğca, Can Ali1 aAşkın, Hakan0 tNutrition and cancer.g2022 Feb. 7, v. 74, no. 2 p.660-676dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl11654x1532-79147nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01635581.2021.19003013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02260naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002800140245007800168300002000246520109500266592002801361650001101389650001101400650001401411650002201425650002501447650001501472650001301487650001701500650002101517650001201538650001201550650001301562650001001575650001701585650001801602700002301620773012401643856007401767852000901841655001201850IND60667200020221119224257.0190919e20150225xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066720002DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra15625k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aʻUs̲mān, Muḥammad,10aRecent advances in the methanol synthesis via methane reforming processes  ap. 21945-21972.  aDepleting fossil fuel resources and continuously degrading environment due to greenhouse gases demands an immediate search for alternative energy resources on an emergency basis to develop a sustainable and green environment. The utilization of coke oven gas, biogas and flue gases from fossil fuel power plants to produce synthesis gas, which is a major feedstock for the production of liquid fuels (methanol), is beneficial both from economical and environmental aspect. In this review paper, our aim is to discuss the applicability of these sources in different reforming processes to produce suitable syn-gas ratio (∼2) for methanol production. The feasibility, suitability and applicability of each source have been discussed in detail accompanied with their environmental impact and detailed economic analysis. Moreover, the influence of different supports, promoters and preparation methods on the catalyst properties to minimize carbon deposition has also been described. This review will summarize all the recent advances in the area of syn-gas production for methanol synthesis.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiogas 3acarbon 3acatalysts 3aeconomic analysis 3aenvironmental impact 3afeedstocks 3aflue gas 3afossil fuels 3agreenhouse gases 3aliquids 3amethane 3amethanol 3aovens 3apower plants 3asynthesis gas1 aDaud, W.

One important consideration is the possibility that a person of interest (POI) may become contaminated with GSR through their interactions with firearms-carrying police officers during the process of apprehension or arrest. This situation has the potential to result in a false positive error, and potentially result in the mistaken inclusion of a POI in an investigation. Prior studies have indicated that receiving a firearm at the start of shift represents a significant contamination event, which may result in GSR persisting on the hands of police officers (Cook, 2016). Firearms-carrying police officers were sampled at various points throughout their shift to ascertain the extent of persistence of GSR on their hands, as a potential population that could then be transferred. A secondary transfer study was also conducted, with several ‘mock arrest’ scenarios used as a means of modelling the extent and dynamics of any secondary GSR transfer.When compared to the random population, it was found that police exhibit GSR contamination of their hands at a higher frequency. 7.9% of the officers sampled in this study returned at least one, 3-component particle characteristic of GSR. Further, 75% of the officers tested had at least one particle considered consistent with GSR present on their hands. However, the overall particle numbers were relatively low, with the average reported number of characteristic particles being less than five, and the greatest number reported being twelve. When considering the possibility of secondary transfer occurring during the process of arrest, it was further determined through secondary transfer experiments that the most probable transfer situation was fewer than 25% of the particles present on an officer’s hands would be transferred to a POI as a result of a short ‘mock arrest’ contact.We conclude that although the possibility of GSR contamination through the process of arrest exists, and is worthy of consideration in the assessment of GSR evidence, it is not an overwhelming, or major concern.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahands 3amodels 3apolice 0aForensic science 0aGunshot residue 0aContamination 0aScanning electron microscopy 0aPersistence 0aSecondary transfer1 aCook, Michael1 aKirkbride, K.

Its clinical presentations were generally nonspecific, making it difficult to assist in the diagnosis. Besides the determination of the common clinical features, the sociodemographic background is essential to identify high-risk populations to assist in prevention. Methods: Data for this study were obtained from electronic medical records among patients clinically diagnosed with leptospirosis at a tertiary hospital in Malaysia from the years 2011 to 2015 and were recorded using standard pro forma. Associations between clinical features and sociodemographics were performed using bivariate analysis and logistic regression. Results: Data were collected from 283 patients. Their mean age was 30.71 years old. Out of 283 patients, 206 (72.8%) were male. Involvement in outdoor events and water activities was the highest risk factor of acquiring leptospirosis in 64 (22.7%) patients followed by 59 (20.8%) patients who were staying in crowded housing areas with poor sanitation. Although fever was the main clinical presentation in 274 (96.8%) patients with leptospirosis, gastrointestinal (GIT) symptoms were the second most frequent in 159 (56.2%) patients followed by pulmonary symptoms, myalgia, headache, and jaundice. From the total number of 283 patients, only 21 (92.6%) presented with severe leptospirosis. GIT symptoms were a significant predictor for leptospirosis severity, while the age group was the significant sociodemographic factor toward GIT presentation in leptospirosis. The relationship between GIT symptoms and crowded housing areas with poor sanitation was also significant. Multivariable logistic regression showed that crowded housing areas with poor sanitation (odds ratio [OR] = 3.570, p < 0.001) and age between 20 and 40 years old (OR = 2.056, p = 0.014) were more likely to have GIT symptoms. Conclusions: Information regarding the clinical features of leptospirosis to the public is necessary, while targeted prevention by educational outreach among 20–40 year olds especially those participating in outdoor water activities are crucial to decrease the incidence and complications of leptospirosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aat-risk population 3abivariate analysis 3afever 3agastrointestinal system 3aheadache 3ahospitals 3ajaundice 3aleptospirosis 3amales 3amedical records 3aodds ratio 3aoutreach 3apatients 3aregression analysis 3arisk factors 3asanitation 3asociodemographic characteristics 3awater activity 3aMalaysia 0asociodemographic 0aclinical presentation1 aAhmad, Hamidah1 aSoh, Kim Lam1 aMd.

We aimed to evaluate the association of weight change (WC) with survival of patients treated with chemotherapy (ChT) for PA and the influence of disease staging. We also studied the prognostic and predictive value of inflammation-based scores. Observational, retrospective cohort study. Individuals were divided into two cohorts, according to WC (WL ≥5% vs. non-WL <5%) after ChT. Main endpoints were weight change and survival time. Statistical analysis was performed using Stata software. Sixty-five patients were included (median age 69; 48% female), 60% with advanced disease. At 3 months after ChT start, 54% experienced WL. Advanced disease independently predicted WL (OR 2.10; 95% CI, 1.11–19.6; p = 0.041). With median follow-up of 14.8 mo, median survival time of patients with WL was 18.5 mo, vs. 33.2 vs. for non-WL (HR 2.28; 95% CI, 1.15–4.52; p = 0.019). In patients with early-stage disease, WL was associated with decreased survival time (21.9 vs. 67.6 mo; HR 23.68; 95% CI 2.39–234.75; p = 0.007), while the association of WL on survival time in advanced disease was not significant (HR 0.74; 95% CI, 0.34-1.60; p = 0.449). The multivariate survival model showed that WL (HR 1.11, 95% CI 1.03–1.20, p = 0.005) and cachexia (HR 3.76, 95% CI 1.07-13-18), p = 0.041) were associated with survival time, as well as location in body or tail (HR 3.05; 95% CI, 1.75–5.31; p < 0.001) and high Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) at 3 months (HR 6.20; 95% CI, 2.59–14.87; p < 0.001). WL was an independent prognostic factor for survival. Particularly in early stage disease, interventions targeting this modifiable factor may translate into better outcomes for PA patients. NLR may be a surrogate marker of systemic inflammatory status in this setting.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadenocarcinoma 3acachexia 3acohort studies 3acomputer software 3adrug therapy 3afemales 3ainflammation 3amodels 3anutrition 3astatistical analysis 3atail 3aweight loss1 aCoelho, Andreia1 aCunha, Renato1 aFernandes, Leonor1 aFontes e Sousa, Mário1 aNeves, Maria Teresa1 aCardoso, Débora1 aMalheiro, Mariana1 aGraça, Joana1 aSantos Silva, Eugénia1 aPlácido, Ana1 aMartins, Ana0 tNutrition and cancer.g2022 Feb. 7, v. 74, no. 2 p.546-554dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl11654x1532-79147nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01635581.2021.19030493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03984naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094024002200126024001900148040001800167100001700185245012700202300001600329506007600345520191000421592002802331506003702359650001902396650001402415650003702429650002002466650001002486650002802496650001702524650001202541650002302553650001602576650001102592650001202603650001302615650004302628650002002671650001602691653002102707653001602728653001702744653002402761653002002785653001902805700002402824700002602848700002402874700002102898700002102919700002002940700002202960700002002982700002503002700002103027700002303048700002003071773013203091856007803223852000903301655001203310IND60643911420221207072749.0190514s2018    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064391142DNAL7 a10.1139/apnm-2017-02282doi7 aPMC62841712pmcid7 a290356952pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Dongmei10aExpression of macrophage genes within skeletal muscle correlates inversely with adiposity and insulin resistance in humans  ap. 187-193.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aLocal inflammation in obese adipose tissue has been shown to contribute to insulin resistance; however, the role of macrophage infiltration within skeletal muscle is still debatable. This study aimed to evaluate the association of skeletal muscle macrophage gene expression with adiposity levels and insulin sensitivity in obese patients. Twenty-two nondiabetic obese patients and 23 healthy lean controls were included. Obese patients underwent a 3-month weight loss intervention. Macrophage gene expression in skeletal muscle (quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction), body composition (dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry), and insulin sensitivity (homeostatic model assessment (HOMA) and oral glucose tolerance test) were compared between groups and their associations were analyzed. To validate skeletal muscle findings, we repeated the analyses with macrophage gene expression in adipose tissue. Expression levels of macrophage genes (CD68, CD11b, CD206, CD16, CD40, and CD163) were lower in skeletal muscle tissue of obese versus lean participants. Macrophage gene expression was also found to be inversely associated with adiposity, fasting insulin, and HOMA (r = −0.4 ∼ −0.6, p < 0.05), as well as positively associated with insulin sensitivity (r = 0.4 ∼ 0.8, p < 0.05). On the other hand, adipose tissue macrophage gene expression showed higher levels in obese versus lean participants, presenting a positive association with adiposity levels. Macrophage gene expression, in both skeletal and adipose tissue samples, was only minimally affected by the weight loss intervention. In contrast with the established positive relationship between adiposity and macrophage gene expression, an unexpected inverse correlation between these 2 variables was observed in skeletal muscle tissue. Additionally, muscle macrophage gene expression was inversely correlated with insulin resistance.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadipose tissue 3aadiposity 3adual-energy X-ray absorptiometry 3agene expression 3agenes 3aglucose tolerance tests 3ainflammation 3ainsulin 3ainsulin resistance 3amacrophages 3amodels 3amuscles 3apatients 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3askeletal muscle 3aweight loss 0aM1/M2 macrophage 0aweight loss 0ainflammation 0ainsulin sensitivity 0askeletal muscle 0aadipose tissue1 aMorales, Flor Elisa1 aIglayReger, Heidi.

The air permeability and tensile strength tests were carried out and the fracture morphology was observed. The results showed that the GPPs with low porosity not only had micron-pore structure with the pore size below 10 μm, and air permeability reached 1.27 × 10⁻¹³ m², but also hold tensile strength with 257.8 MPa. Particularly, its air permeability and tensile strength were significantly superior to nuclear graphite, stainless steel foam, and porous alumina ceramics, equivalent to porous titanium. This study provides an effective method for the fabrication of micron-scale metal GPPs, and is of great significance for expanding the application range (especially in the fields of micron-scale precision filtration and the porous throttles of the aerostatic bearing) of porous materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aaluminum oxide 3afiltration 3afoams 3agraphene 3apermeability 3aporosity 3astainless steel 3atechnology 3atensile strength 3atitanium 0aGradient porous plate 0aPore size distribution 0aAir permeability 0aTensile strength 0aRolling 0aVacuum sintering1 aZhou, Zhaoyao0 tPowder technology.g2022 Feb., v. 399 p.117205-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11732x0032-59107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2022.1172053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03216naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002000143245006000163300001600223520153900239592002801778650002801806650001701834650000801851650002101859650001501880650001001895650003501905650001001940650001401950650004301964650001402007650001902021650001102040650001802051650001202069650001002081650001702091651001202108653001402120653001602134653001702150653003802167653000802205653001102213700001902224700002202243700002002265700002702285700001602312700001702328700002102345700002202366773013902388856007802527852000902605655001202614IND60682845820221118011916.0200601e20200601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068284582DNAL7 a10.1089/vbz.2019.25302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFischer, Stefan10aPatchy Occurrence of Cowpox Virus in Voles from Germany  ap. 471-475.  aCowpox virus (CPXV), genus Orthopoxvirus, family Poxviridae, is a zoonotic pathogen in Eurasian wild rodents. High seroprevalences have been reported previously for vole and murine species in Europe. In contrast, viral DNA was only rarely detected, and very few reservoir-derived CPXV isolates exist. In this study, CPXV DNA and CPXV-reactive antibodies were monitored in wild small mammals for 5 years in four German federal states. Screening of liver tissues of 3966 animals by CPXV real-time PCR (qPCR) revealed five voles of two species positive for CPXV DNA. Two positive bank voles (Myodes glareolus) and two positive common voles (Microtus arvalis) originated from two plots in Baden-Wuerttemberg. One positive bank vole originated from Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania. None of the small mammals from Thuringia and North Rhine-Westphalia was positive in the qPCR. CPXV antigen-based indirect immunofluorescence assays of 654 highly diluted chest cavity fluid samples detected two bank voles and two common voles from the same sites in Baden-Wuerttemberg to be highly seroreactive. Five animals were CPXV DNA positive, and four other animals were orthopoxvirus seropositive. Our study indicates both a very low prevalence and a patchy occurrence of CPXV in common and bank voles and absence in other rodent and shrew species in Germany. The multiple detection of infected voles at one site in Baden-Wuerttemberg and continued detection in a region of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania classify these regions as potential endemic foci.  aPublisher supplied data 3aClethrionomys glareolus 3aCowpox virus 3aDNA 3aMicrotus arvalis 3aantibodies 3achest 3afluorescent antibody technique 3aliver 3apathogens 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3ascreening 3aseroprevalence 3ashrews 3asmall mammals 3atissues 3avoles 3awild animals 3aGermany 0abank vole 0acommon vole 0acowpox virus 0aindirect immunofluorescence assay 0aPCR 0arodent1 aFranke, Annika1 aImholt, Christian1 aGethmann, Jörn1 aSpierling, Nastasja G.1 aJacob, Jens1 aBeer, Martin1 aHoffmann, Donata1 aUlrich, Rainer G.0 tVector borne and zoonotic diseases.g2020 June 01, v. 20, no. 6 p.471-475dMary Ann Liebert, Inc.wJournal:J000000160x1557-77597nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1089/vbz.2019.25303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02840naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245011900174300001600293520135600309592002801665650002301693650002401716650002601740650001601766650001301782650002601795650004401821650001101865650001001876650001301886650001501899651001101914653002601925653002601951653001701977653001601994653002402010700002002034700001802054700002302072700001902095700001802114700002002132773009902152856008602251852000902337655001202346IND60635609220221120181305.0190402e20180515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063560922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2017.12.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShakeri, Abolfazl10aIn depth chemical investigation of Glycyrrhiza triphylla Fisch roots guided by a preliminary HPLC-ESIMSn profiling  ap. 128-136.  aChemical investigations on Glycyrrhiza spp. have mostly been focused on G. glabra (typically cultivated in Europe, henceforth called European licorice), G. uralensis and G. inflata (known as Chinese licorice) with little information on the constituents of other Glycyrrhiza species.

Based on this approach, 6 previously unreported compounds including two isoflavones 7,5′-dihydroxy-6,3′-dimethoxy-isoflavone-7-O-β-d-glucopyranoside (4) and 7,5′-dihydroxy-6,3′-dimethoxy-isoflavone-7-O-(7,8-dihydro-p-hydroxycinnamoyl)-β-d-glucopyranoside (7) and four saponins, named licoricesaponins M3 (13), N2 (14), O2 (16) and P2 (18), have been characterized.It is to be noted that the accurate masses of some compounds here reported for the first time corresponded to those of compounds previously described in Glycyrrhiza spp. Thus an approach based only on MS analysis could be misleading; only isolation followed by NMR analysis allowed us to unambiguously assign the structures of these previously unreported compounds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGlycyrrhiza glabra 3aGlycyrrhiza inflata 3aGlycyrrhiza uralensis 3aisoflavones 3alicorice 3aliquid chromatography 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aoxygen 3aroots 3asaponins 3asweeteners 3aEurope 0aGlycyrrhiza triphylla 0aHPLC-ESIMSn profiling 0aNMR analysis 0aIsoflavones 0aTriterpene saponins1 aMasullo, Milena1 aD'Urso, Gilda1 aIranshahi, Mehrdad1 aMontoro, Paola1 aPizza, Cosimo1 aPiacente, Sonia0 tFood chemistry.g2018 May 15, v. 248 p.128-136dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2017.12.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03086naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100003600143245008100179300001600260520149500276592002801771650002401799650000801823650001301831650001001844650001501854650001901869650002201888650001001910650001301920650003001933650002301963653001501986653001102001653002402012653001502036700003202051700003102083700002802114700002902142700002702171700002902198700003202227700002502259700001802284700004002302773013902342856007802481852000902559655001202568IND60682845920221118011927.0200707e20200701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068284592DNAL7 a10.1089/vbz.2019.25452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSoares, Tânia Cristina Benetti10aPrevalence of Bartonella spp. Infection in Patients with Sickle Cell Disease  ap. 509-512.  aBackground: The inherent characteristics of the sickle cell disease (SCD), the most common genetic hematological disorder, increase the propensity of infections. Bartonella spp. are emerging and neglected bacteria. A large spectrum of clinical manifestations has been linked to bartonella bloodstream infection in the last two decades that can cause fatal outcomes, especially in immunodeficient patients. The goal of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of bartonella infection in SCD patients. Materials and Methods: We evaluated Bartonella spp. prevalence in 107 SCD patients. Blood samples and enrichment blood cultures were analyzed by molecular detection of Bartonella spp. DNA. Bartonella DNA was amplified using conventional genus-specific Bartonella PCR which amplifies the Intergenic Transcribed Spacer region and Bartonella henselae-specific nested PCR which amplifies the FtsZ gene. Positive patient DNAs were tested with ssrA conventional PCR. All amplicons were sequenced. Findings: Ten of 107 patients tested positive for B. henselae infection in at least one molecular test. All obtained amplicons were sequenced and similar to B. henselae sequences deposited in GenBank (accession number BX897699). Based on statistical results, bloodstream infection with B. henselae was not associated with animal contact or blood transfusions. Conclusion: We detected B. henselae DNA in 10 (9.3%) SCD studied patients. These patients were notified and treatment was offered to them.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBartonella henselae 3aDNA 3abacteria 3ablood 3ablood flow 3ablood sampling 3ablood transfusion 3agenes 3apatients 3apolymerase chain reaction 3asickle cell anemia 0aBartonella 0aanemia 0asickle cell disease 0aprevalence1 aIsaias, Gustavo Alves Brito1 aAlmeida, Amanda Roberta de1 aDrummond, Marina Rovani1 ada Silva, Marilene Neves1 aLania, Bruno Grosselli1 aVieira-Damiani, Gislaine1 aSaad, Sara Teresinha Olalla1 aEricson, Marna Elise1 aGupta, Kalpna1 aVelho, Paulo Eduardo Neves Ferreira0 tVector borne and zoonotic diseases.g2020 July 01, v. 20, no. 7 p.509-512dMary Ann Liebert, Inc.wJournal:J000000160x1557-77597nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1089/vbz.2019.25453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02586naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245009100170300001600261520131400277592002801591650001501619650001501634650001201649650001101661650001601672650001801688650001701706650002001723650001601743653002101759653003101780653002201811653003501833653002401868700003301892700006001925773009701985856008502082852000902167655001202176IND60764021620221116141649.0220214e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076402162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2022.01.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDavoodi, Vajihe10aPresenting a power and cascade cooling cycle driven using solar energy and natural gas  ap. 802-813.  aA configuration is presented where solar energy is parallel with fossil fuel to steadily supply a combined power and cascade cooling system. The cascade cooling system produces a steady cooling load at shallow temperatures. The variations of solar radiation during a year are considered. The system combines an improved ammonia-water power cycle with an absorption-compression cascade refrigeration system. The exhaust from the power cycle drives the absorption chiller. Working fluids are ammonia-water for absorption and power cycles and R134a for compression chiller. The effects of turbine inlet temperature, the ammonia concentration in the power cycle, boiler pressure, and generator temperature are investigated. Considering the cooling section's exergy efficiency, the generator temperature is optimized at 110.5 °C. The power cycle's boiler pressure and ammonia concentration are optimized using a genetic algorithm for various cooling loads at various turbine inlet temperature values to find the maximum annual exergy efficiency. The results show that, in all investigated cooling loads, the maximum annual exergy efficiency with a mean value of 65.66% happens at the turbine inlet temperature of 210 °C, an average boiler pressure of 58.56 bar, and an average ammonia concentration of 81.16%.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aalgorithms 3aammonia 3aexergy 3anatural gas 3arefrigeration 3asolar energy 3asolar radiation 3atemperature 0aSolar-gas system 0aCombined power and cooling 0aGenetic algorithm 0aAbsorption-compression chiller 0aWaste heat recovery1 aKazemiani-Najafabadi, Parisa1 aAmiri Rad, Ehsan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4550-81340 tRenewable energy.g2022 Mar., v. 186 p.802-813dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2022.01.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02697naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245018000159300002000339520127500359592002801634650002201662650002101684650001501705650001501720650002501735650002201760650000901782650001301791650001801804650000701822650003301829650003301862650001501895650002301910650002501933700002201958700002001980700002102000700002302021773012402044856007402168852000902242655001202251IND60667200420221119224209.0190919e20150211xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066720042DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra15637d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAsfaram, Arash10aRemoval of basic dye Auramine-O by ZnS:Cu nanoparticles loaded on activated carbon: optimization of parameters using response surface methodology with central composite design  ap. 18438-18450.  aThis research is focused on the ultrasound-assisted removal of Auramine-O (AO) dye from aqueous solutions using ZnS:Cu nanoparticles loaded on activated carbon (ZnS:Cu-NP-AC) as an adsorbent. ZnS:Cu nanoparticles were synthesized and characterized using FESEM (Field-Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy) and XRD (X-Ray Diffraction) analysis. The experiments were designed by response surface methodology. A quadratic model was used to predict the variables. Analysis of variance was used for investigation of variables and interaction between them. High F-value (48.91), very low P-value (<0.00001), non-significant lack of fit, and the determination coefficient (R² = 0.977) demonstrate good correlation between experimental and predicted values of the response. The highest removal percent attained was 99.76%, and the optimum parameters achieved are: adsorbent amount (0.02 g), initial dye concentration (20 mg L⁻¹), sonication time (3 min) and pH = 7. Adsorption processes of AO by ZnS:Cu-NP-AC could be well described by a Langmuir isotherm and a pseudo-second-order kinetic model. The maximum adsorption capacity of AO by ZnS:Cu-NP-AC was determined as 183.15 mg g⁻¹, suggesting a highly promising potential for ZnS:Cu-NP-AC to be used as a new adsorbent.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aactivated carbon 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aanalysis of variance 3aaqueous solutions 3adyes 3akinetics 3ananoparticles 3apH 3aresponse surface methodology 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asonication 3asorption isotherms 3aultrasonic treatment1 aGhaedi, Mehrorang1 aAgarwal, Shilpi1 aTyagi, Inderjeet1 aKumar Gupta, Vinod0 tRSC advances.g2015 Feb. 11, v. 5, no. 24 p.18438-18450dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ra15637d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02492naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245015000168520119000318592002801508650001501536650002501551650001201576650002001588650001701608650001101625650001101636650001701647650001401664650001601678650001301694653001501707653001701722653002401739653001401763653002501777700001701802700001601819700002101835773010801856856008501964852000902049655001202058IND60779829320221120154018.0220802e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077982932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fuproc.2022.1073512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSubhan, Fazle10aHighly dispersive Cu species constructed in mesoporous silica derived from ZSM-5 for batch and continuous adsorptive desulfurization of thiophene  aZSM-5 zeolite with long narrow pore structure could restrict the adsorption of sulfur compounds from commercial fuels due to their larger molecular dimensions. Herein, ZSM-5 as silica precursor and CTAB as template was successfully employed using dissolution and self-assembly method to synthesize micro-mesoporous silica (MMZ). Compared with ZSM-5, MMZ materials could effectively overcome the diffusion pathway, enhance mesopores and enlarged the BET surface area (830 m²/g). After MMZ crystals were fabricated with 5-20 wt% Cu content by ultrasound facilitated impregnation strategy, the active sites were improved, which promoted thiophene adsorption capacity from 0.9 to 0.44 and 0.48 mmol/g via π-complexation conducted under dynamic (flow) conditions in a fixed bed adsorber and batch stirring tang reactor, respectively. And the desulfurization performances decline in the order 10Cu/MMZ >20Cu/MMZ > 5Cu/MMZ >10Cu/ZSM-5 > MMZ > ZSM-5. The higher adsorption capacity was tentatively linked with well dispersive Cu nanoparticles (NPs) and textural properties of MMZ. Furthermore, the ADS activity of Cu/MMZ towards thiophene can be recovered well without nominal loss.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acopper nanoparticles 3adecline 3adesulfurization 3aporous media 3asilica 3asulfur 3asurface area 3athiophene 3aultrasonics 3azeolites 0aAdsorption 0aCopper oxide 0amicro−/mesoporous 0aThiophene 0aDeep desulfurization1 aAslam, Sobia1 aYan, Zifeng1 aYaseen, Muhammad0 tFuel processing technology.g2022 Oct., v. 235 p.107351-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12445x0378-38207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuproc.2022.1073513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02766naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100006300155245010400218300001600322520152800338592002801866650001501894650002501909650002001934650001701954650001101971650001401982650001101996650001402007653002802021653001402049653002302063700001502086700002602101700002202127700002902149773009102178856009002269852000902359655001202368IND60563762420221120061811.0181011e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056376242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2017.02.1252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNieto-Librero, A.B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6643-247X10aClustering Disjoint HJ-Biplot: A new tool for identifying pollution patterns in geochemical studies  ap. 389-396.  aThis paper introduces a new mathematical algorithm termed Clustering Disjoint HJ-Biplot (CDBiplot), which searches for the underlying data structure in order to find the best classification of the object groups in a reduced space. To this end, disjoint factorial axes are generated, in which each variable only contributes to the formation of one factorial axis. A graphical representation of the individuals and variables is performed using the HJ-Biplot method. In order to facilitate the use of this new method within any practical context, a function in the language R has been developed. This work applies the CDBiplot to study an environmental geochemistry case involving environmental pollution in river surface sediments. The study focuses on an area close to an important mining and metallurgical site, where sediments share a similar geological origin and chemical composition. The algorithm permitted a detailed study of the geochemical interactions and performed an excellent separation of the samples. Thus, the groups obtained were formed according to a similar geological origin, location, and nature of the anthropogenic inputs based only on chemical composition data. These results allowed clear identification of the sources of pollution and the delimitation of the polluted zones. All things considered, we conclude that the proposed algorithm is a powerful tool for studying environmental geochemistry data sets, and suggest that the application of this methodology be extended to other research fields.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3achemical composition 3adata collection 3ageochemistry 3amining 3apollution 3arivers 3asediments 0aDisjoint factorial axes 0aHJ-Biplot 0aSediment pollution1 aSierra, C.1 aVicente-Galindo, M.P.1 aRuíz-Barzola, O.1 aGalindo-Villardón, M.P.0 tChemosphere.g2017 June, v. 176 p.389-396dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2017.02.1253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03636naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002200125024001900147040001800166100002400184245012700208300001800335506007600353520187900429592002802308506003702336650001702373650002802390650002002418650002302438650002102461650001502482650002502497650001502522650004002537650002302577650001702600650003202617650001902649650002102668653002402689653002502713653001502738653001902753653001702772653000902789653001902798700002102817700002102838700002202859773011302881856007902994852000903073655001203082IND60515059120221207083208.0160312e20151101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051505912DNAL7 a10.1089/jmf.2015.00242doi7 aPMC46381962pmcid7 a262748272pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCicero, Arrigo F.G.10aTesting the Short-Term Efficacy of a Lipid-Lowering Nutraceutical in the Setting of Clinical Practice: A Multicenter Study  ap. 1270-1273.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe main guidelines for cardiovascular disease prevention suggest that nutraceuticals could be an efficacious tool to improve lipid pattern. Our aim was to carry out a clinical trial comparing the metabolic effects of a combined nutraceutical containing both red yeast rice and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and a phytosterol-based approach in a setting of clinical practice. This was a multicenter open study with parallel control. We consecutively enrolled 107 pharmacologically untreated subjects affected by primary polygenic hypercholesterolemia and metabolic syndrome, assigned to 8-week treatment with a combined treatment with red yeast rice (Dif1Stat®, including 5 mg monacolin K) and 610 mg PUFAs. A parallel group of 30 subjects with similar characteristics was treated with phytosterols 1600 mg/die. In the combined nutraceutical group, compared with the baseline level, we observed a significant decrease in total cholesterol (TC; −42.50 ± 18.1 mg/dL), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C; −37.6 ± 13.6 mg/dL), triglycerides (TG; −19.8 ± 25.1 mg/dL), and non-HDL-C (−43.1 ± 17.7 mg/dL) (all P < .001). In the phytosterol-treated group, compared to the baseline level, we observed a significant decrease in TC (−13.7 ± 4.3 mg/dL), LDL-C (−17.6 ± 8.5 mg/dL), and non-HDL-C (−14.1 ± 5.6 mg/dL) (all P < .001). When comparing the combined nutraceutical effect with that of phytosterols, we observed that the combined nutraceutical intake was associated with a significantly higher decrease in TC, LDL-C, TG, and non-HDL-C (all P < .001). In the short term, a combined nutraceutical containing red yeast rice and PUFAs is well tolerated and efficacious in reducing plasma lipid levels in subjects affected by primary polygenic hypercholesterolemia and metabolic syndrome.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3ablood lipids 3acardiovascular diseases 3aclinical trials 3adisease prevention 3afunctional foods 3aguidelines 3ahypercholesterolemia 3alovastatin 3alow density lipoprotein cholesterol 3ametabolic syndrome 3aphytosterols 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 3ared yeast rice 3atriacylglycerols 0adietary supplements 0ahypercholesterolemia 0amonacolins 0anutraceuticals 0aphytosterols 0aPUFA 0ared yeast rice1 aDerosa, Giuseppe1 aPisciotta, Livia1 aBarbagallo, Carlo0 tJournal of medicinal food.g2015 Nov. 01, v. 18, no. 11 p.1270-1273dMary Ann Liebert, Inc.x1557-76007nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1089%2Fjmf.2015.00243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02821naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245016400169520143300333592002801766650001401794650001301808650001201821650002001833650002301853650002201876650001101898650002401909650003101933653003301964653001401997653002302011700001402034700001802048700001502066700001502081700001402096700002302110700001902133700001402152773011402166856008602280852000902366655001202375IND60743790520221122181732.0210926e20211015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074379052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.1265842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiang, Yuting10aBenzene decomposition by non-thermal plasma: A detailed mechanism study by synchrotron radiation photoionization mass spectrometry and theoretical calculations  aNon-thermal Plasma (NTP) catalysis is considered as one of the most promising technologies to address a wide range of environmental needs, such as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and NOx removal. To meet the updated environmental emission standard, the NTP catalysis reaction system needs to be better understood and further optimized. In this work, the degradation process of benzene in NTP, which is still regarded as a “black box” process, was explored by synchrotron vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectrometry (SVUV-PIMS). For the first time, we observed over 20 representative species by PIMS and identified their structures accurately by photoionization efficiency (PIE) spectra. Phenol, acetylene and acrolein were recognized as the three main products. More intriguingly, concentration profiles demonstrated that a large amount of acrolein and also several higher-order products, which were usually neglected in previous research, were produced during the NTP destruction process. The details of the benzene degradation reaction mechanism, were finally established by the combination of SVUV-PIMS results, thermochemistry and theoretical calculations. This work helps to complete the mechanistic picture of plasma chemistry, which may be helpful on raveling the more complicated NTP catalysis mechanism in the future therefore contributing to design of improved NTP system for environmental applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetylene 3aacrolein 3abenzene 3ablood chemistry 3acatalytic activity 3amass spectrometry 3aphenol 3areaction mechanisms 3avolatile organic compounds 0aNon-thermal plasma catalysis 0aSVUV-PIMS 0aReaction mechanism1 aLi, Jiayi1 aXue, Yingying1 aDan, Ding,1 aJiang, Zhi1 aHe, Yaoyu1 aShangguan, Wenfeng1 aYang, Jiuzhong1 aPan, Yang0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2021 Oct. 15, v. 420 p.126584-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.1265843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03185naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001700155245015400172520152500326592002801851650002901879650001301908650001101921650002101932650001901953650001701972650001701989650001902006650002902025650001502054650002102069650001702090650001702107650001502124650001502139650001402154650001602168650001802184650002802202650001202230650001502242653003502257653002002292653003302312653003002345700001302375700001602388700001902404700001802423773009102441856009002532852000902622655001202631IND60685128820221120104847.0200516e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068512882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.1262862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXie, Lingcai10aSWNTs-PAN/TPU/PANI composite electrospun nanofiber membrane for point-of-use efficient electrochemical disinfection: New strategy of CNT disinfection  aSingle-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) can be used as 1D electrochemical disinfection material for point-of-use water treatment but are limited by their poor durability and possible cytotoxicity. Immobilizing SWNTs in nanofibers with electrospinning served as slow-release technology develop a novel with a lasting antibacterial and (eco-) toxicological alleviation of SWNTs. Hence, the single-walled carbon nanotubes-polyacrylonitrile/polyurethane/polyaniline (SWNTs-PAN/TPU/PANI, SPTP) composite electrospun nanofiber membrane was successfully fabricated by co-electrospinning process and the electrochemical filtration and disinfection system of point-of-use drinking water treatment is constructed. In the absence of electrolysis, the SPTP filter is effective for complete removal of bacteria by sieving mechanism. Concomitant electrolysis in the course of filtration results in significantly increased inactivation of sieved bacteria. Application of 3.0 V leads to complete (5 log) inactivation of bacteria within 20 min. 5-cycle experiments, membrane flux and shake flask tests prove that composite restrict the excessive release of SWNTs retaining the long-lasting antibacterial properties of SPTP membrane. At 1.0 and 2.0 V, electrolyte concentration and composition is irrelevant to electrochemical inactivation consistent with oxidation of SPTP filter. Bacterial reactive oxygen species (ROSs) also support an oxidation mechanism. At 3.0 V, electrochemical disinfection mainly relies on indirect oxidation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibacterial properties 3abacteria 3acarbon 3acarbon nanotubes 3aculture flasks 3acytotoxicity 3adisinfection 3adrinking water 3adrinking water treatment 3adurability 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrolysis 3aelectrolytes 3afiltration 3ananofibers 3aoxidation 3apolyaniline 3apolyurethanes 3areactive oxygen species 3asieving 3atoxicology 0aSingle-walled carbon nanotubes 0aElectrospinning 0aElectrochemical disinfection 0aLong-lasting inactivation1 aShu, Yan1 aHu, Yongyou1 aCheng, Jianhua1 aChen, Yuancai0 tChemosphere.g2020 July, v. 251 p.126286-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.1262863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle
